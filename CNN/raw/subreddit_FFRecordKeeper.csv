If it has realm numbers like XIII and the word  most likely it means level up any character from Realm of FFXIII to lv . Also this doesnt need to be accepted first for completion. Say if you have Lightning whos at lv  you can simply take the quest to level a XIII character to lv  then get immediate reward after you accept it. And then another one will unlock which is to level XIII chara to lv . And then another one to level to . Some quests that needs you to create abilites have the same kanji on the party window where you create abilities. Like above the quests that needs you to hone abilities have the same kanji on the party window where you hone abilities. So these two are easy to figure out if you can memorize kanji. I usually just mix and match the abilities name inside the bracket  kanjihereTheres also a quest for you to max an armortype equipments and combine an armortype equipments and another one combining it twice. Likewise theres another three max any type of weapon and another one for combining it and another one combining it twice.

What we must know is if what we can grind allows us to be competitive. Do tougher stages start having the bosses regularly drop  gear? That is a way that they can scale the playerbase forward. Maybe a grind able  similar to how we have the black cowl currently. Remember too as stages get harder they give more xp. RS  characters have effectively level  stats.

3809279,0,t3_341vdp,. For some equipment yes. Realm synergy on equipment is very important if you want to defeat some of the later content. Until you max out your inventory  slots I would hold on to most of the drops you get.. Thundara and Thunderstrike should be priority as a lot of bosses are weak to thunder. Then you may want to focus on thinks such as Blind. In terms of healing spells try and get Cura. Refining spells is also a good idea. This will increase the amount of times you can use it not damage output. The events should come back around for Sephiroth so I would not worry. Im  sure there will be another opportunity. Tidus was originally a bonus for Preregistering but I see no reason why they wont include an alternative method to get him later. One more note Save all your Mythril for Relic Summons ONLY. At least until you get much further in the game. DO NOT use it on trying a fight again or restoring energy. ,FFRecordKeeper,cqqhl36,4,t5_3779b

3883621,0,t1_cqyyfo0,Im actually curious to see how the difficulty plays out in global for ex dungeons. As a day  player most of the difficulty has been overstated. I imagine coming in late is a bit rough though. Personally I dont view it as expensive as its a clear goal set by the game and Ive cleared all other content. It is quite simply a reason to keep playing. When there is a few days of down time I find it hard to motivate myself to grind orbs. Last thing about materia and bosses and such multiple bosses are starting to become more common in a dungeon. Which again raises its feasibility in my eyes. Would of been pretty awesome for example to be able to replenish a summon during this event. Hit no  with Alexander. Next battle onion knights get hit by ifrit. Next battle flan group through Alex at them again. By the time  shows up again youd probably have both ready to go again. Zero hone needed.

3984470,0,t1_cragn1s,I think if I had the Blitz sword for cloud I probably would have gone for a Retaliation build and opted for  casters rather than a wakka support.  I dont really see any way for anyone to beat it with no mythril without either a Blitz Sword or Wakkas ball unless they had their skilled honed a lot Basically  sets of BioraQuakeetc or another top tier SB relic.  Unfortunately youll have to either get very lucky with your SB pulls and farm a lot of skills or pay money if you didnt get lucky with relic pulls since there isnt any FF RS gear.Not sure if the exploit would be on the same lines as a Retaliation exploit or not.  Im sure both were not intended for use in the game... but if they are there Ill use them!However there is someone in chat that seems pretty close to being able to do it without Wakkas ball.

Sword  attack  attack at  up  attack at  up Axe  attack  attack at  up  attack at  up Bow  attack  attack at  up  attack at  up Knife  attack  attack at  up  attack at  up Ball  attack  attack at  up  attack at  upThis means upgrading is much more valuable to the player but a  is still worth majorly celebrating.  You also have to make decisions about limit breaks versus utility when you havent yet d the ball weapon in this case.This one simple change would increase pulls for DENA since all those s would have real game value and also help the free players since farming items would be significantly valuable and arguably better than pulling a  on the  items.,FFRecordKeeper,crd3xj9,2,t5_3779b

4029492,0,t3_36nsdj,I dont see anyone mentioning it here but the biggest issue I see is almost all the abilities are Rank .Thats just not going to cut it on the Hardest event on both versions. You need at least Rank  if your gear cant carry you far youll need rank  and .I also dont see a power break for the TREX. On top of that youre only running one heal. I can very much see why you are almost dead before you reach the boss.I would run double heal on your White Mage. You dont have any need for Kain replace him with Wakka and run boost and double cut if you are going to use boost.Unless you are constantly reloading for blind to hit I would get rid of blind on Rinoa.After you make those changes the ability setup looks fine but the ranks might still be too low.To be completely honest you will probably need to resort to using a mythril or two for the TREX fight.Dont be discouraged if you dont clear it.

Im going to grab Vanille and then keep running Lenna for a few more days I want to try and get all the s before its over and having Vanille leveled for the Heroic version of the event will make things much easier. Edit To clarify  I understand Im not going to be able to get all of the s or anywhere near it  Im just trying to get all of the ones I can before the event is over. The drop rate Ive seen so far for the Greater Orbs is terrible and I skipped farming the Aerith event so Ive got to make up some ground. Hopefully craft Bladeblitz and Hone my Quake.

The draws are clearly dependent on luck and trying to buy your way to success based on luck seldom works out. Thats why youll find fp players who hit multiple s in a single pull and someone like yourself who drops hundreds on pulls and ends up with less. Its luck there are also people who spend the same as you do and get much more again its luck.Your better off just playing it free save the mith and draw when you can. I started right at the end of the Rinoa event and I have four natural s.  from a single pull  from a  pull and  from another  pull. I would have been plenty happy with  items because as a fp player most items from an  pull is an upgrade. But it feels like the second you start paying your essentially chasing a high that you may or may not be able to afford.

You only really need a single good physical weapon.  The most valuable weapons on the table right now are magic weapons Binding Rod and Sentinel Grimoire.

At level  MAG is  th highest  higher than Celes but  lower than Rydia Rinoa and Terra.  MND is  th highest but considerably lower than Lenna  Aerith  and Vanille .  His most distinguishing strength is his  support only Tyro Wakka and Terra can use  or higher much like Celes with spellblade..  Ability to equip swords spears bows and shields make him more suited for attacking using support abilities than magic using.  Also unable to equip rods severely limits his effectiveness as a black mage.  ,FFRecordKeeper,cs206on,1,t5_3779b

I would personally give Sephiroth the R Retaliate and give Cloud a honed Double Cut. You dont need  Retaliators on one team.

They usually give us enough to get by as is so I doubt making the game so hard that it pressures people into spending is something theyre interested in.  People have gotten through some of the hardest content in global so far without using natural  stars or even rolling at all.  Just like other microtransaction based  games spending money doesnt win you the game it makes it easier which is a pretty standard model.  FFRK is special in that it taps into a huge reservoir of nostalgia as well and I think I see more people rolling because they like the game or because they like the character more than Im not strong enough to move on therefore I must roll.

I really like how all these people are complaining about farminggrinding when thats alot of the game. Mindless boring unchallenging grindfests meanwhile people still farm Granaldo or challenge event bosses mindlessly and people complain about the grinding of a collection event funny times. At no point did anyone ever hold a gun to someones head and make them farm flans collection etc  yet people still cry about grinding. If anything the Challenge events have been very easy since maybe like Lockes.

4541649,0,t3_3d9tpu,If you like me have been playing the latest dungeon Elites then you would know that these bosses hit for such an incredible amount of damage that you basically have to reduce their stats to really chop away at them. A while ago the original Breaks were sufficient because they would lower the stats enough to make the battles manageable. For instance the Falcon FFVI Elite boss that appears in several rounds has been criting my characters for .k without damage mitigation. After a Power Breakdown the damage hits much more like  for front row for back. He also has this AoE Aeroga which just chops off  HP without crit on all of my characters which by the way are wearing some seriously nice gear Ive been using Magic Break on that because I dont have enough orbs for enough hones for Magic Breakdown to be worth it. The endgame is becoming more and more difficult that it basically requires a serious look at the skills we have and to get ready to replace some.All of this being said I really wouldnt bring in any Breakdowns that arent honed at least once because their usefulness at R is very limited due to the short time that they last.,FFRecordKeeper,ct33pt2,0,t5_3779b

I get that Record Keeper is meant to be a simplified version of traditional ATB Final Fantasy games. But there is a line between whats hardbutfair and overlyfrustrating. Its already impossible to be OP before most fights well most Elite fights that are coming out the least the game could allow us to do would be to let characters who can go beyond  damage do it.Well who knows... although it wasnt the case in Japan maybe DeNA will patch the next level cap break to allow for breaking the damage limit as well.,FFRecordKeeper,ct4lbbb,0,t5_3779b

4557008,0,t1_ct4pn3d,There are actually   Light armours available Wild Bear Balamb Garden Uniform Adamant Vest Viking Coat. Of course Wakkas equipment selection is broader because not only can he also equip Light Armour but he has Heavy Armour and Helms under his belt too. Im glad you prefaced your comments with at least in my team because that makes your comments much more fair. Again Id like to point out that evaluating characters based on global statements about common or uncommon equipment types is not useful. Saying that Frans defences are terrible because Light Armour is rare is a useless comment for anyone with good Light Armour. Shes actually much bulkier than Wakka if you do own Light Armour. If you dont thats another story but its not fair to assume that no one owns Light Armour at all which you havent since youve added your disclaimer just saying for the general public. Id also like to add that its not like Heavy Armour or Helms are significantly more common at all anyway there are   heavy armours in the game and like   Helms. So if you lack one of the  Light armours but have one of the  armours that Wakka can equip but Fran cant only then is Wakka defensively superior and even then not by a whole lot if you have a decent hatrobebracer.I agree that not having combat is a disadvantage at this point in the game. I probably wouldnt call it HUGE but its definitely inconvenient for the majority of players who probably dont have good  hones. Leg shots not a bad ability at all though for Celerity and gives Fran something to do. The only thing holding it back is that you might not want to craft it because of the upcoming Dual Delay which is just... better.I think its fair to say that Wakkas a bit better than Fran at this point in time. But Frans not far behind at all and will catch up quickly as players progress towards honing Breakdowns and Celerity picks up Dual Delay and Dismissal. Shes certainly not . bad.

4563442,0,t1_ct5soei,The game is singleplayer in pretty much every other aspect except the events and RW. RW is something that adds a way for you to interact with your friends and to show off the best of your gears which could give just a tad bit more interest for people who care about fame to spend money on the game. It also adds a bit more complexity to the game which Im all for. Events well I dont really see any reason why they couldnt just be normal content. They could make them so that once youve proceeded far enough into a certain realm they will be unlocked.The stamina system in turn acts as an exit point for the player so that once theyve spent their stamina they can go do something else and feel like theyve accomplished something. I guess the developers wanted to put a system like that into the game just for that accomplished feeling. And it can also be used as part of the monetization system. The stamina system is something I can live with but it just doesnt really feel like it fits into the game that well. You end up being punished for just trying things out.,FFRecordKeeper,ct5u5ht,0,t5_3779b
4563705,0,t1_ct5sk34,Actually most of the rods dont have good mind at all.  Rods in general have good MAG and bad MND.  A  Full Metal Staff for example has MAGMND at lvl.  Compare this to Yunas rod with MAG MND at lvl.  Most rods follow this pattern.  You can see how her rod is pretty much just double the normal on MND.  Heck Yunas rod has  MND at lvl and even Vivis  Oak Staff only has MAGMND at lvl.The same applies to most staff weapons as well in reverse.  Good MND and bad MAG.  A  Judgment Staff for example has MAGMND at lvl.  Compare this to Garnets staff with MAG MND at lvl.  Most staff weapons follow this pattern.  Garnets staff practically has double the MAG value of the other staff weapons.,FFRecordKeeper,ct5vc93,2,t5_3779b

4574489,0,t1_ct7283g,The ex items all came from two events the Emperor SaGa collaboration and the Brass De Bravo collaboration. IIRC for each event the ex items you got from the banner were the only things that would get record synergy boosts within the event levels. After the SaGa event ended I believe all the items were changed to be Core synergy items like Tyros Grimoires and the Behemoth Knife. All the Brass De Bravo items have a Realm listed in the banner that they reverted to after the event ended  either FF FF or Core Job in the Japanese version.,FFRecordKeeper,ct781jq,1,t5_3779b

Also had Diara on Yuna plus Curaja.  Rydia for Blizzaga and Kirin ignored regular healing for basically the entire fight.  Then Tidus and Squall or Cloud with good wepons.Mental Break is helpful with all that caster damage.  Basically if you start the boss fight with full abilities minus some quakes you should end it with  or  casts left out of ish.  Forget what RW I used.  Try to have the Kirin and RW going on the trash round before the boss to save a cast and if Kirin goes down if your health is over half ignore it.,FFRecordKeeper,ct7a29y,1,t5_3779b

4576897,0,t1_ct6q0ao,I dont necessarily agree. I think that its best to evaluate assuming all characters because it would be a moot point to argue in the absence of a character. It is also way easier to get characters than  specific relics and arent as useful as talking about effects that only apply to one character. Thing is most generic SB weapons are not substantially more useful than Character SB assuming you have both. Of course the ones you have will be most useful because otherwise its not a fair comparison of the charactersequips as they are to you. I dont have Terra but I wouldnt give her a  stars just because of that as she is useful to other people. As for skills everyone will probably get the necessary skills eventually which you can get through the game by playing dungeons events normally.The thing is characters that specialize in spears arent more useful than other characters in their roles. That isnt the case with BW mages who are all but required so of course some prioritization is necessary. This is due to boss conditions and the necessity of healing. And good daggers are somewhat hard to come by despite being a common equip set  mage mashers are in Yunas event! and arent especially stronger than other weapons. As a result I would consider Sephiroth all but unusable without a Katana when weve got Cloud with Swords.The point is that there is a GENERAL  sorry forgot what italics is on mobile guideline. More people will have swords than not simply due to the nature of their availability number of characters who use them etc. More people will not use instruments because the characters out right now are not useful with them. In fact one thing you might not be taking into account is that some weapons are not generally more useful for most people. If I had Balthiers gun it makes no sense to give him a  spear. Could this be more complexconsider all situations? Yes I agree with that but in those cases you could not look at a character alone. It wouldnt be a singular character review but a review of multiple characters. Essentially youre arguing about the format of these threads when what you are looking for is not the point of these threads. These threads are probably useful for more people than not as it brings a simpler look at things that are generally true. This is a review not an indepth character comparison and analysis that looks at every possible situation tailored to your situation. Some personal discretion is necessary. Does it make sense to write half of the content on situations  of people wont encounter?

As long as you continue playing the game youre not going to run out.

Its a remake of the PSP version Dawn of Souls so it actually has a lot of bonus dungeons and some item rebalancing no Mithril Swords in Elfheim for example. All in all its a solid version and imo its much improved over the original. The main problem with this version though is that at least on ios there is a crippling bug where when you level up you either get the minimum or maximum amount of HP increase and its something like a  chance to get the minimum increase. What I mean is that if a warrior would normally gain between  and  hp per level in this version they will only gain  OR  and  of the time theyll gain the .

A physical character can carry bladeblitz r and another useful skill like power break use bladeblitz with the help with boost probably to clear out  waves of trash and still have another stable damage output for the boss. On the other hand a summoner with Valefor r and summoners spring II can clear out  waves of trash depending on how far the dungeon goes and then .. what? At this moment there are no summonblack characters so the best skill in the other slot would be an r black magic which at this moment is a little too low in terms of damage.

It further reaffirmed that numbers may be divided in groups of three in order to facilitate reading neither dots nor commas are ever inserted in the spaces between groups e.g.    . This usage has therefore been recommended by technical organizations such as the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology. So even according to American standards  and . are both right while . is typed with an error.

First no Gaia Vest on Rinoa. Second I thought Sleep Buster was stronger than Sleep.Generally the key here was the  sleeps. I only kept  of them asleep at a time so that Mental Breakdown and Leg Shot could squeeze in their extra damage on that target to alow me to focus fire them down.I got Id say medium luck . I landed  of my Busters having used  but the  of them were in a row. I also landed  out of  Sleeps. I never tried sleeping all  having to keep mostly  asleep at once then only  as the fight reached the end. I ran out of abilities on mostly everyone so the lack of Summons was certainly pushing my luck after all  summon hitting    uses of an Aja spell as far as this fight goes and Mental Breakdowns little tidbits of help most likelly were required. Alternativelly I had the orbs to R Biora which would accomodate for the loss of damage from MBreakdown.Healing is not only not needed but detrimental in calculating how far from mastery you are.,FFRecordKeeper,cup6zvt,1,t5_3779b

5008860,0,t1_cupnld4,Totally agree. I have some good hones and gear and it was still hard to me.Others have heavy AoE builds which is bound to help. But the key takeaway is that it is possible with his gear then it isnt a FP issuegear issue it is you havent invested enough time farming to beat the top tier content. I have very little in AoEs in my run and I almost wished I did invest into summons.No one should expect to play casually and beat the hardest content there has to be a line drawn somewhere where those who do farm hardcorepay can win while those who dont will have a much harder time doing so.With  Major orbs as a reward Id say its been a long time coming.None the less you might be able to win burning  mythril on buffs and building SBs which is essentially still free. You would still come up on top in my opinion.  mythrils for  Major orbs sounds like a good deal to me.,FFRecordKeeper,cupr98a,1,t5_3779b

I spent so much time and effort tweaking my party set up gearing up and then cycling through Roaming Warriors for half an hour just to find a Luneth RW for a Tyrotaliate strategy.  I finally got everything looking great went through the dungeon I have no FF XIII gear to speak of aside from a Healers Staff got to Brynhildr beat her......only to realize I forgot about the Ice Weakness requirement.  Three medals missed and with them Mastery.  I had to go through the entire dungeon and fight Brynhildr again this time with Blizzara Strike on Lightning.So.  A week or two later I finally got around to doing the same dungeon on Elite.  I put the same amount of time and prep work into my set up and had similar issues finding a Luneth RW.

5014168,0,t3_3jgmho,Alright so Ive beaten Maduin if anyone wants to have a go at him. Keep in mind that I actually only took one try to beat him so I cannot say if anything ends up being different from experience.Ill be going off the data thats posted in this thread combined with my experience.This fight has  phases. gt HP This is his first Magic Sealed form. Keep in mind you cannot use magic here. He doesnt use anything except singletarget possibly multihit Physical attacks here.  to  This is his first Magic Released form. This is your chance to heal up and all that. He only uses Magic attacks for this whole phase.  to  This is his second Magic Sealed phase. Once again Magic is blocked. He will use his AoE Dispel at the beginning of this phase.  to  This is his Magic Released weak state.  to  This is his Magic Released very weak state.Overall I felt the fight wasnt as hard as the previous Misfortune fights probably the easiest one yet for me as this is the first and possibly last time Ill ever one shot a Misfortune fight with Mastery as his attacks are rather predictable and dont do any crazy form of bursts ie. Vossler has CT Exdeath takes  immediate turns every round and possibly spams AoEs nor has any stupidly ridiculous gimmicks ie. CT again Yunalescas Osmose spam and unmitigatable Holy or Beatrixs Climhazzard.Tauntaliate is your best friend here. You will not be able to heal during his Magic Sealed form so one of your mages becomes the best candidate for summoning your Sentinel GrimoireStoneskin RW. Tauntaliate also gains great value during his Magic Sealed phases because of the multihit but single target only physical attacks. Hence you do not need Protectga or Power Breakdown for this fight. Especially if you do go the Tauntaliate route you can fire off SG once at about  HP before he goes to Magic Released form and once more at  when he enters Magic Released weak state.Once the shield drops and you can cast magic again immediately cast Magic Breakdown on him and put Shellga up. None of his attacks are very threatening but your goal is to drop him to  HP before your first charge of SGStoneskin wears off.He will then use Evil Dispel  so be prepared to buff up again. After that the fight mainly repeats itself  you simply have to be vigilant with keeping Magic Breakdown and Shellga up.Key skills you should bring include Retaliate Draw Fire Shellga Magic Breakdown and your  different elemental attacks of choice.Bring DispelVanish Raid to this fight as well. He will cast Protect and Regen on himself  both of which can be Dispelled.

5043791,0,t1_cuti5l2,As some new abilities Ive been eyeing for a while are coming up soon I think you will do more than just try!  Also nice in the sense that you only have to have enough good gear for  characters since unless youve been junking everything you get you have good gear with RS thats left over or unequippable to others. Having reflect honed up to R or R will be an unforeseeable til you see it tactic for for many situations unless DeNA get really reflect immune happy.  Some RM that gets big boost to SB per hit taken as well as any that start battles with a free status that can last  or more of the whole wave like like the ones with protect regen we have now shell and reflect in the future. I just did the elite FFXIII lvl with the skytank to get some last minute mythril and would have actually used the  chance to jump RM since I let him take front and center for the first two waves because the only weapons I have for there is the  gun and stupid  power fist!  So that didnt work by the way PSA because A draw fire doesnt overpower Lock On before or after..  Or he only used NAT abilities on me in like  different SL runs. B missiles are effectively random target NAT gravity Im guessing as another boss had missile that was reflectable while a past report in this boss someone stated retaliate and Cecil SB worked.  i wanted to test it so left carbuncle behind. need spell taunt or missile attack is BLK in the code since he mentioned safety bit... but then again I was unable to taunt the guns to me either...

5064832,0,t3_3k94zp,Im surprised nobodys brought up orb exchange yet.For the price of R Meteor you can get  greater black orbs  greater nonelemental orbs  greater fire orbs and  greater earth orbs.  greater nonelemental orbs is huge Id much rather have  R breakdownssteals for  greater nonelemental orbs than  R Meteor for .  R Meteor seems pretty niche handy for dailies but rarely worth the wasted slot on tough bosses where its  uses will run out quick same problem with lowhoned summons and absolutely a far lower priority than wellhoned  abilities it shares orbs with.On the other hand knowing about Orb Exchange Ill be much more reluctant to overhone BlizzajaThundaja unless absolutely necessary before Full Break is released you need  major or  greater ice and lightning orbs to hone Full Break to R and leaving Blizzaja and Thundaja at R instead of R saves you  of each almost halfway there!  Hopefully wellhoned duplicates of BlizzagaThundaga and R BlizzajaThundaja are sufficient to master all content until Full Break and the Orb exchange are released.As usual honing advice boils down to dont hone it till you need it and the above two cases absolutely fall under that rule of thumb as well.  Meteor is nice to have sure but dont be tricked by it not sharing any  orbs with anything else orb exchange is coming the next several months will pass sooner than it seems especially if dena continues their trend of giving us UIQoL upgrades far sooner than scheduled and I doubt the shortterm niche utility of Meteor will outweigh the longterm penalty of not saving those orbs for x the amount of  orbs once we get the exchange.Of course if you think youll be well set on  hones by the time we get orb exchange and want the added little bit of utility you get from crafting Meteor now by all means go ahead.  Its a great ability and dailies will be even easier than they already are with it.  Im still very underhoned on  abilities that Meteor shares orbs with so I wont be honing Meteor for a very long time even though I have enough orbs to craft it today.,FFRecordKeeper,cuwi5uc,1,t5_3779b

You repeatedly mention we are missing things. Tell me if you had no knowledge of the Japanese version at all would anything be missing? And as far as login bonuses are concerned I figured we would get them isnt really a defensible highground.Finally what does DeNa need to be held responsible to exactly? They have created a product for your enjoyment at no cost to you that you seem to enjoy very much.

There are more details in the newbie guide but Retaliate lets your mages attack your Retaliate user and his counters will hit the enemy for full damage similar to how Reflect works letting them get a large amount of damage in without using precious ability uses in the process.

Traditional jobs were not implemented until later down the . road so combatwise Thancred was Gladiator.In ARR they retconned him into being a Rogue for his actual combat class but his personality is the same. I feel they wanted to capture this essence of him into his FFRK skill set due to there being little else to work with.

I was lucky enough to pull both Diamond Pin and Vega and Lunatic HighBoon have not once helped me win any of these fights.  For them to be useful you need to bring the character in question which you often wont and charge hisher SB gauge up in order to use them which is nearly impossible in a stage with no preliminary rounds you can use to do so.

Simplify to . greater orbs per  stamina and we deduce that you get approx.  greater per  stamina or  major per  stamina at present assuming the  conversion.  Now isnt math fun?Also relevant  it will take          days of farming to get  Major Black Orbs and  Major Power Orbs assuming the rate above.  So dont skip any Tuesdays!

Since theres no guarantee and the  chance is so low AND we get a boatload of free mythril I probably wouldnt spend anything. I have read so many stories since I started playing about people who dropped money and got no s so they dropped some more.. and a little more... and just one more time because Im SURE ill get it now..There was a thread just a couple days ago from a guy who previously entirely FP started buying x pulls and then  later he decided to trash his items and give away the account. Obviously all people have differing levels of self control but its generally not worth the investment unless you have a large amount of surplus cash.

5197459,0,t3_3m6eyb,Absolutely. If you are obsessive about it you may even be able to get Zacks memory crystal as well! I can say this because I started my game a few days before the Rinoa event a few weeks ago and nabbed her crystal. If you do some easy story progression to build max stamina and exploit Sunday you can pull it off.You want his crystal because it will mean he can stay on your team when you get it up to the lvl  mark which will be sooner than you think. I played this game before when it was first released and they dramatically changed how fast newcommers can catch up. In just two events after I started I was able to get  of my  team members level broken Wakka MC where are yooooooooou? and amazingly I managed to beat Golbez up to the  fight! Not the  Dark Bahamut though... I didnt even try.Ill give you the best pieces of advice I know warning I just spilled my brain out here... Do story dungeons as many as you can today and tomorrow to build up stamina and get some easy orb rewards. You want to get at least Aerith before Sunday if at all possible. Zacks dungeon is difficulty  so getting him this weekend may be tricky but possible I think. Your priority should be getting exp right now and soon youll have  VII players on your team to seriously boost your performance in the Aspiring Hero event. Aerith is an awesome white mage and will be a great asset to your party after the event but I dont think youll get her crystal for a while. She gets increased Summoning ability eventually but I dont know when. Drop everything Sunday except getting Aerith and Zack if you can and spend the day playing the exp dungeon. Play it at whatever difficulty you are able to master a single stage on. Mastering the stage is important because it ups exp by . Mastering all  stages is less important for you and you can exit after one if you are hurting. Here is why you wanted a larger max stamina pool you might want to use mythril on some stamina refreshes and having a bigger pool means you get more out of it. I dont recommend using more than a few refreshes but it can help to level up fast. I know what youre thinking mythril is too precious for that! Its true usually and youll want to do a few  pulls soon as a new player but you can spare some trust me. Youll be getting a metric ton of them just by doing dungeons. After Sunday just play whatever you can master to get rewards. Play the daily dungeons once on easy and normal to get the mastery. Play the event as far as you can safely go. By far the best thing you can do is reap the juicy orb rewards in the elite section of the events as thats where they made the biggest boost to new players. If you abuse the next two Sundays and use your stamina on story dungeons mostly your characters will be around mid lvl s before the event is up. You want as many of the  orbs as you can get your hands on and they give a bunch. And if you get Zacks crystal he can stick around when you are breaking lvl  for the next event. Good luck!Edit A couple more tips I just thought of.Get Rydia soon from the IV dungeons to round out your party. And keep Tyro hes VERY versatile. His lower stats dont matter much until the higher levels and even then his ability to use any weapon and skill is super important as hell fill the gaps left by the rest of your team.Besides Sunday I wouldnt focus too much on the dailies for your first week or two except for the Monday and Friday equipment material dungeons. You want to upgrade at least some of your equipment to survive the event but the orbs you need should come naturally. Hone a couple double cuts and aga spells a few times when youre able. In a few weeks getting  and  star orbs becomes priority for you more than exp. Honing is the only way youll stay in the game.Edit  Save your eggs unless you are desperate to level up your main team before the event is up. Use all your eggs on White Mage and Black Mage core characters. Youll thank me later.,FFRecordKeeper,cvchjrt,2,t5_3779b

5239046,0,t3_3mranv,The only way a bruiser can keep up with mage damage in this game is if you use advance as your RW sacrificing SGSSIIBoonLH with boost.For sacrificing so much mitigation through RW bruisiers can equal mages for two stages.  Mages can spit that kind of damage out for an entire dungeon depending on hones without sacrificing mitigation.

5303555,0,t1_cvpkm8x,Not having fun because a boss is tuned to  shot you even through recordrealm synergy and having to retry the battle over and over and over and over until RNG gives you a break is pretty reasonable in my humble opinion.Everything about this game has been a blast but fights like this one and the Rinoa event Sleeporlose battle are kinda joy breaking. I dont mind a challenge Dark Bahamut from GolbezTellah was really fun Beatrix from Eikos event was really challenging but still fun Sanctuary Keeper just feels unfair not really challenging. I only won because RNG smiled on me I used reflect on him and he spent almost the entire battle doing absolutely nothing but spamming Protect  Haste which reflected on me until it did though it was a boring grindfest of SLing for almost  hours because the boss kept using Mana Breath or that AoE status ailment ability before I could get my mitigations up and  shotting someone or heavily crippling my party before I can even do anything other times he could Counter Tail Swipe twice in a row and instantly kill  members of my party without any way to really prevent it. Its not challenging like Dark Bahamut or Beatrix were its just gambling with RNG until you win.EDIT However Tyro  Clouds RM will change my opinion of this slightly being able to use something like Sentinels GrimoireStoneskin  and Lunatic High immediately will change this slightly as itll drastically reduce the amount of time needed to put up significant mitigations without sacrificing your offense to do it.,FFRecordKeeper,cvplahx,2,t5_3779b

Ive been trying to say all it takes is strategy and to not bring in low level characters that cant handle a  stage.  I mean there are people right now who have farmed it  times and the SL is not as bad as the OP makes it out to be. They probably just attempted it and were unprepared with a strategy andor the necessary levelgear.  But instead of attempting to find a strategy that works for them they come here to complain about needing to SL.  Which mentioned by uKnofbath is not what youre supposed to do in the first place.

Requiem is a decent alternative nuke to Diatype spells in the case where Holy isnt a good element to use and its also really cheap to craft and hone. Other bard songs are pretty good. Summons are always welcome.If you get a Soul Break Relic for a good healer thats usually a good one to take.

5414112,0,t3_3p4j46,They really should have called the boss rush  Kefka  and the Dragons  instead of the current version. The first boss was infuriating chaining one aoe after another forcing me to restart because the damage output with breakdown ffs was much too high. Then comes Mr RNG Deathgaze  killed Terra next killed Vivi. The next two were easier despite the Stooges being potentially able to kill a character before any mitigation if you are unlucky.Seriously the Rush is pure SL land.Then Kefka aka everything depends on the first ability I use I had to SL once after he started with Blizzard. Then the dragons are just pushovers.  Didnt even use SG on the Ice one just Shell amp Breakdown. I only lost medals because the Fire one managed to place its aoe attack in weak state just after Shell went down.

If youre not open to that of course thats totally fine.Its mainly my budget isnt open to the idea I might drop  for stamina refreshes to collect some Mythril from backlogged elites I havent finished yet though.

How about a fight with Ozma and Hades from IX? You got the  Dragons from FF VI. Then theres all the bonus dungeons from the games that have them.

With Retaliate generally if you refresh it on every third turn it will have fallen off at about half way through the AT bar being filled if you dont have Haste up. With Haste up it will easily last until that third turn. If you want to be safe hone Retaliate up a bit and cast it every other turn.

5595490,0,t3_3rrnnd,pulls are fundamentally greater returns for your mythril.  The tradeoff is you spend in greater increments so you can pull say your desired item and ten threestars where a single pull lets you stop when you see the fivestar.What the pull does for you isnt so much make it likely to get free crap so much as it is just giving you an extra roll thats no more or less likely to be crap than any other roll.  The human brain is just really bad at understanding statistics so seeing that desirable fivestar surrounded by threestars makes us inherently think were getting less value for our mythril when in fact were getting more value.  Its one of the reasons the cult of the threepull exists.  Youre more likely to get a fivestar in a threepull than a onepull and with less chaff immediately surrounding it than in an pull.  Each individual pull has the same expected value but the brain perceives it just differently enough to influence how we feel about each option.Put another way if we look at it in terms of economics if a given relic pull has an expected utility value of say  just for easy math then a fivemythril pull gives you    utility per mythril.  A threepull gives you    utility per mythril.  An pull gives you   . utility per mythril.  So unless you value being able to stop at a point of your choosing pulls are always preferable if youre targeting a specific item or subset of items.,FFRecordKeeper,cwqo8nx,5,t5_3779b

I had previously also honed Firaja to R only as well so its not exactly a clear path for me on which one to hone. I guess I wont hone more until I absolutely see the need to.This is the predicament that a lot of us entered into very early on with  orbs except back then the scarce resource was Lightning Orb and thus we all honed our Blizzaga and Firagas up but for Thunder some of us stuck to using Thundara Sword instead because Lightning Orbs were also being used for many other things like the much loved Intimidate.Looks like now in the  tier we have a case of too few GFOs and GIOs thus led many of us to hone Waterja instead... though the ability is statistically more sound to craft than the others.,FFRecordKeeper,cwsj0fy,3,t5_3779b

5730817,0,t1_cx7g3o4,gtIf there were no other clearly better healer than him in the same synergyWhy does the synergy realm matter when were not comparing Who is the best FF White Mage but rather Put all the White Mages in the game into one of half a dozen tiers by relative power level? I do not understand your rabid insistence on this especially since I was very clear that realm synergy is not something I took into consideration for the rankings. There are  soon to be  different realms there will not be top tier characters in every archetype for every realm and some realms will have multiple top tier characters in the same archetype. Thats just how things work.gtPhysical damage is already far easier to mitigate than magic damagePhysical damage is exactly as easy to mitigate as magic damage is. Neither is easier to mitigate than the other.gtRelm has far better Mind the most important stat of a WM.Mind is the most important stat to a White Mage but not nearly to the same degree Magic is to a Black Mage  and note that even with a Black Mages Magic being more important I still rated characters with lower magic but more durability and versatility higher than Lulu and Vivi.gt Relms default Soul Break is useful No it isnt. Literally the only time in the entire game I have ever ever used Confuse is for the Enki and Enlil fight where its a medal condition. The incredibly vast majority of bosses including ALL high level bosses are immune to Confuse. Its utterly useless in any fight worth mentioning. Mogs at least does something in almost every fight barring longrange fights maybe not sure if its considered a ranged attack.gtRelm can use WM  Mog cannot.Oh wow Relm can use Holy and Full Life. Big freaking deal. Nobody cares about either of those skills theyre both total wastes of orbs. White  might be useful depending on what the White  ability actually ends up being but as you yourself point out this is supposed to be judged on what is currently present not what may be in the future. White  is a total red herring.gtRelm has MCII  Mog does notMC or not is irrelevant. I judged based on stats not levels. Tyro has  levels and White  over Mog too that doesnt make him an S Tier White Mage.gtTo say that theyre on the same tier of usefulness as WMs on that virtue alone is not a really fair claim. It is absolutely fair. You have made continued spurious false misleading and contradictory claims with no actual solid ground to base your argument on. Youve morphed from Mog is a worse Paladin Cecil to Mog cant heal to Mog cant heal as well as Relm. My argument has remained constant and to be blunt largely unaddressed by you. Thus my conclusions remain. Im open to discussion on my rankings as this thread has shown but that requires discussion rather than rhetoric.gtThere are other support char options if you want dancingMog is one of exactly three characters who can use Break Fever with the other two being Tyro and Penelo. If you want Break Fever Mog is your best option IMO though none of the three are bad.gtThere are always at least two viable skill options for RelmThere are always at least two viable ability options for Mog too so Im not sure what thats supposed to mean.,FFRecordKeeper,cx7gpk1,3,t5_3779b

5741672,0,t1_cx8rwmk,Full Break is really nice when its not resisted but it isnt even necessary for boss rushes so R isnt tempting me. Ifrit went down so fast in this event that Full Breaking him wouldve just been overkill. Theres still a good chance youll get at least one usage back from Ethers during a boss rush if you do want to use it though. I mostly use the first charge while Im still setting up mitigation and the nd charge later on during the critical stage of the boss. Itd be nice to have it throughout but my support ends up using their SB attacking a retaliator or using the RW on the turns when Armor Breakdown is still active.My Iai Strike is only at R since I dont use it very often. Even R wouldve been fine but R makes it viable so youre not stuck autoattacking. It has a . multiplier if I recall correctly so its almost as strong as a regular break. I have an excess of the required orbs from dailies now but Im going to save and convert them up later rather than waste them on situational abilities.I also have the gearhones to do a full mage party but the major thing that turns me off from it is that all the abilities are capped at  damage whereas even Double Cut can do more in a phys party. They also have longer cast times than physical skills it takes .s for most spells vs .s for most phys skills. Attack is only s and its free so mages tend to deal very poor dps in comparison. Only water spells are somewhat efficient at .s but theyre still beat by .s Celerity skills. I think the last time I used a full mage party was against the Holy Dragon in FF since it can be put to sleep. ,FFRecordKeeper,cx8t67p,1,t5_3779b
5742701,0,t3_3ts57b,First of all better  odds either by upping the chance even further introducing roling gatcha or better yet guarantee that pulls always include a  or if failing to pull a  make it at least so that half are  or something. Saving for an pull and only seeing  is crushing... I feel they should nerf the need for SL my suggestions on a way to do so areRemove the absolute randomness of who goes first Everyone starts the battle with an empty ATB bar and thus Spd stat will be the one to determine who gets the first turn. Also add some accessories that boost Spd or that give AutoHaste so we can strategize better around that mechanic.Either give us AoE heals as abilities we can craft or have all AI only capable of only doing single target attacks on the first turn or AoE at half strength. As it is getting hit by a strong AoE before mitigation is pretty much a game over or at least a lost of Mastery.Either give us a rd ability slot so we can have space to carry stuff like Raise and Esuna although this a rd slot might take too much rebalancing... or give us more ways of avoiding negative status because currently the accessories we have are mostly useless since they dont even give  protection. There should also be a Ribbon accessory to ward against everything.Another idea I had is that they could alter the Forging System so that instead of only being able to use  for stats you could also fuse accessories like Start PendentSilver GlassesJeweled Ringetc into weapons or armor. When an accessory like Silves Glasses was fused into a weapon it would give it a chance to proc Blind you could alter the chance by how many Silver Glasses you used and fusing it into an armor would give protection against that status.Make all characters relevant even if its a niche! Some characters are just so bad theyre so many tiers bellow others of the same class theres never a reason to use them some feel that even with RS and sometimes even with character specific SB would still be weaker than others. Im thinking of characters like Kimari Cyan and a lot of the FFII cast. MCs for everyone! We already saw this when MCs started coming out characters that were stuck at  were soon benched and the only reason for them to get back on the active was when their MC came out. It feels like this is going to happen again with MCs and I dont want to have some of my favorite characters benched again for months or more just because theirre stuck Lvs lower than others so please make MCs come out faster or somethingBuff certain ability schools with more useful abilities. Theyre already making Dragon more relevant with elemental jumps but those are still worse than spellblades give them something like Breath attacks. Monks are nearly useless and could definitely use better abilities. Ninja is also very weak at the moment and even Samurai could use some extra stuff. Some extra quests would be nice like those  man quests or defeating an enemy with specific characters. Something that could provide some extra challenges and minor rewards nothing too important so that you dont feel too bad if you cant do it.,FFRecordKeeper,cx8xrkb,1,t5_3779b

5928312,0,t1_cxwp85z,I thought about that too before I started spending as much as I have but then again...have you played a TCG or a OCG? To be a top tier player in the Pro status you most likely have to play a meta deck to make top tables and win prizes. I used to play YuGiOh! and was a semipro. I would almost always use meta decks and back in the day some of them would cost several thousand dollars. Now I wouldnt have to pay for all of them I could pull some of the cards from packs or trade for what I needed unlike FFRK but for the most part the easiest way to get the cards you needed was by buying single cards. Sure my friends and I spent a LOT of money over the years on that game because even when we sold cards at the end we didnt get back nearly what we spent as they decreased in value due to being banned or power creep. But the real joy in life as many successful people will tell you is in the experiences. The way the game makes you feel stories you can tell the feeling when you pull those rare items...thats what your money truly buys you. So yes there will come a time when the game will end or when some of us will quit and may regret the money we put into it but in the long run what matters most if how much enjoyment we got out of it. And I can say I in both YuGiOh! and FFRK I find more enjoyment in using the relics and cards I want even if I have to play for them. Another way to look at it...if you go on vactations to concerts conventions sporting events etc...most of those cost a lot of money too over time and you will never get that back. But you dont care because you did it for the experience. I look at gaming the same way not always the best feeling to pay for something like that but if you truly enjoy it its the same as spending on any other experience that you dont recover your cost. ,FFRecordKeeper,cxwqe95,3,t5_3779b

Average stats aside Tyro is useful for obscure skill combos will get synergy in every Chamber of the Abyss dungeon will be able to use every six star skill and will almost always have RS choices because of his unlimited pull.

5968284,0,t1_cy1x4pc,Now for the other half..  Cloud Buster       is a useful synergy to be sure and Cloud is the almighty Cloud Keeper and a stiff  can be great.  However  events happen all the time.  As of this posting were a couple days into Sephiroths Blood Madness event.  Its fair to say that waiting a month will give you a better FF weapon.      An edit to clarify the rating being given for it given Clouds strength this weapon can certainly carry you deep into content especially combined with the Retaliate skill.  But even at a new players early stage it can be useful to think about other characters because youll need to at some point anyway and I think its better to start early.  As such then...      Rating Not for Mog Select.  Valkyrie      If youre picking this weapon its because you like Rinoa  something well agree to disagree on.  But in your defence youre making a damn fine choice Rinoa and Hope can both use mage throwers and theres definitely value in splitting an oftencapping Thundaja spell into three pieces.      Rating Worth considering.  Storm Staff      If you prefer a more general Black Mage stick to help your journey this is the right choice.  Garnet herself is unremarkable but respectable at White Magic and summoning the SB is a summon offering a lightning AoE.      Rating Worth considering.  Dusk Lance      FF has an unfair share of difficult bosses so you might be tempted to nab this for RS.  And its not bad... except that it is for Kimahri.  If you dont know Kimahri... well lets just say that he needs quite a bit of work before hell resemble being useful.      Rating Dont consider this..  Ras Algethi      Balthier is a rather good fighter pairing good looks with a variety of skills and weapons including guns for ranged fighting.  Sazh is a fine support from  who really needs a gun to perform optimally.      Ras Algethi is a gun.  So if you fancy any of the gun users you might consider this.  The SB summons a map of Ivalice and then floods it hitting all enemies for water damage.      Rating Worth considering for some.  Wild Bear      Ugh why.  Armour is a pretty nice thing to have though by the time youll need it you may have picked some up from event rewards or other pulls.  This one isnt so nice Ice Punches are nifty but just not up to snuff here.      Rating Not viable.  Ninja Chainmail      The SB is actually decent  but Thancred is a bit of an odd duck.  Also the same caveat about armour applies here as with Wild Bear but moreso because you wont have FF synergy until FF starts getting DU content which is a ways off.  And thats even assuming that you have Thancred right now rather than having started after the FF event.

Thaaaaat sounds like a lot of conditions to maximize that damage of a soul break. Worth noting having the conditions of level  Squall in an FF dungeon would also likely result in max damage of Rough Divide meaning its k damage in situational circumstances vs. a weapon that allows physical sword using characters to do more damage overall if youre lacking in enough  swords anyway particular in FF dungeons.,FFRecordKeeper,cy2zbyj,1,t5_3779b

Yes this is not an inconsistent answer.Given infinite chances to test each scenario the expected value of procs is equal because of simple maths if we give a  value for a proc then were looking at the difference between these two equations    x .   x .   x .   x ..      x ..The first is a FOIL process of ..  with each term valued differently according to how many augment ranks would be obtained from    or  procs.  They both work out to . so they have the same expected value.  Now if were in a position where some of the larger proc could be wasted the smaller procs pull ahead.In the SHORT term  because we dont have an arbitrary number of augment materials or targets nor that high a chance  its arguable that having more chances to get ANY procs would be better.,FFRecordKeeper,cy73j7i,1,t5_3779b

6077632,0,t3_3ysoxk,I think youll be fine with future content as is. And waiting until real game changing relics would be ideal since you say you already have hastega and pp. Whaling on more stuff that isnt going to do much for you except make your inventory more glittery is a waste of mythril money. So yes that Icebrand is enough. Heck I have combined four stars that are good enough to clear dungeons so top tier items and soul breaks arent necessary. So think of it this way if you got everything you wanted in this game would you still be challenged by the content it offers? My take on it just wait for game changers because you already got most of everything covered. For example why draw for Lights SSB if its going to be eclipsed by her BSSB? ,FFRecordKeeper,cyg9fn1,2,t5_3779b

6098525,0,t3_3z29yz,Advantaliate is definitely be doable without SG.  You should carry carbuncle though for the second half of the fight.  Took me about  SL to champion without any wall or hastega.  I did use  charges of full break.  With the amount of damage I did close to k a hit didnt need to use a third full break.  Most of the reset came from multiple vacuum waves a couple from dispel the rest from aoe spams.  I did have HotF and used it once. I probably got lucky during second half of the fight since he mostly spammed single target spell.  I think I got hit twice by aoe when I championed.I even had a dead weight terra on my team lol.  Dead weight as in she can only hit once per turn.  I brought her initially to hit the elemental requirements with blizzaja thundaja and trance fire SB.

Id recommend Auron since you have his Shiranui which is pretty nice.Best team to work on from that list Auron Shiranui  Retaliate amp PowerMagicArmor BreakDarkmoonetc. Bartz  Steal Power and  Spellblades Faris  Magic Breakdown and Boost Aerith  Curaga and Shellga KrileRydia  Black MagicOthers of note are Tyro Rikku and Galuf since you have his Kaiser Knuckles.  You can continue to use Galuf since you pulled his relic maybe in place of Bartz but truly Kaiser Knuckles arent great for Galuf.  Its a really cool RW thats hard to use as a native SB so Id still look to replace Galuf plus Bartz is so flexible that he is worthwhile.,FFRecordKeeper,cyjckx5,1,t5_3779b

6225211,0,t1_cyx7zcw,The people who are interested inhave gathered this data are the ones who are clearly interested in the math behind the game myself Enlir pintbox etc. While youre correct that speaking literally only the stats at current and maximum levels matter directly there is some potentially useful information to be gathered from analyzing character growth rates. For an example from another game series in Fire Emblem theres a character archetype called a Jeigan after the first example of the character type they start out at a higher level than your other characters and thus have stats which are strong compared to others but their stat growth is terrible and unless youre incredibly lucky FE stat growth is based on random rolls a Jeigan character will be drastically weaker than your other characters once those characters catch up to the Jeigans level.Theres nothing that extreme in FFRK but its still potentially useful to know when a character wont stand up longterm. One of the things Im doing in the spreadsheet Im working on is producing expected level  stats for every character to provide a completely even and impartial if theoretical playing field for theoretical comparisons. Do those level  stats actually matter in the game as it currently exists with characters capped at level  maximum? No of course not. But they do give us a glimpse into the future and inform our decisions even if only in small ways.Or at least it would if I could be at all confident in how stat growths work. If theyre completely at the whim of DeNA with no recognizable formula I cant do that analysis. If as others have posited here growths are essentially static postlevel  Im fine and can just do my level  stats based off post growths.,FFRecordKeeper,cyx8lpy,1,t5_3779b

6291377,0,t1_cz4lor5,The two phases of that fight are more or less dangerous depending on your setup since you can kind of optimize to be better at one than the other.Also the way the damage ramps up after the third turn plus the fact that one or both of the attachements gets hasted means theres potentially a huge difference in the amount of damage based on how long you take even if its just one turn extra. For my first setup I usually took two rounds of attacks after the first amplification before I cleared them and a lot of times that was enough AoE to wipe my party or put me in a dangerous spot after the phase switch. Switching my Ruinga to Meteor didnt seem like it increased my damage that much but the extra damage added up over the first  turns to let me finish the fight a turn to a turn and a half earlier and it made a huge difference in the amount of damage I took.,FFRecordKeeper,cz4rbu8,1,t5_3779b

Theyre pretty light on Content and lag behind somewhat nowadays though FF is still a Game I like to play from time to time.If you have like  Afternoons to burn you could theoretically play  once its an extremely short game especially once you know the Sequence.  is a bit of Trial and Error the game is rather openended its not uncommon to die on the World Map because you accidentally went to an Area that is balanced for later in the Game. And  atleast try to play the NES Version with a Translation applied. The D Version was horribly unbalanced in the AIs favour because of Hardware Limitations Enemies were overtuned because they couldnt fit more than  at a time onscreenOther than that Id absolutely support the Idea of playing  PSP or GBA  GBA and  GBA. Why all the portable ones? They are the most polished Versions while still having the SNES Graphics which is an especially contested point for V and VI on Steam and extraContent the original Versions lack. ,FFRecordKeeper,czs42fu,8,t5_3779b
6504924,0,t3_44qhh4,While most people dont recommend FF or FF if you care to have a legal copy of FF the SquareEnix Final Fantasy Portal app in the store is letting you download it for free right now as part of their anniversary I think. Its the easiest way to get into FF right now short of digging into yknow things of questionable legality.Anyway if youve played  and  youve already played the more modern Final Fantasy games worth playing. If youre looking to enjoy the retro stuff definitely consider     Most of those      and  are actually relatively cheap on Steam right now and FF is set to be released on that platform fairly soon as well. Likely by the time you get through everything youll care to play pre  will be out on Steam.Besides those the spinoff games typically dont handle well. The only ones that do are typically within Final Fantasy Tactics scope though if you can manage it somehow Crisis Core is also a great spinoff and playing it before FF will make you appreciate it way more as a game than you might have if you hadnt. There are tons of people who will swear up and down that Mystic Quest is worth the time to play but unless you find monsters letting out death flatulence when you kill them hilarious youll probably not have the patience for the game or be willing to carve out the time to play it.Anyway if youre looking for recommendations based on personal bias    and  are the only ones worth playing if youre looking for a quality Final Fantasy experience.  is the first game to really flesh out the job system the staple of most of the best Final Fantasy games that come after it  takes everything  does with the job system runs with it and improves it and the story is more enjoyable in comparison  is hands down in my opinion the best Final Fantasy ever made for reasons that will become apparent the deeper you dig into that diamond mine and finally  is a breath of fresh air after  and  because it goes back to the series fantasy roots and does so extremely well.If you have to pick one to play you might as well go with .Though those are my personal recommendations as a Final Fantasy fan I think its worth playing every single one of them from start to finish.

6509772,0,t3_44sq3z,I do Entrust gt Stormborn  x Crushing Blow for fun sometimes.   x  SSBs   potency I think. Most bosses die before you can use the full combo though .  I think I recorded a video awhile ago against FFIVs Bahamut in a dungeon and she did  per hit Crushing blow is  hits with the element resisted  Planet Protector  Breakdown  Full Break.  So k unresisted?  Something like that.  Very much overkill to the point where its probably not worth setting up.  Lightnings SB is really the best SSB in global at the moment IMO  x hits with an element attached so its ideal for combos like this.From my experience Entrust is only really useful and FUN in dungeons.  If youre running ultimates usually youre better off having all  characters use their own SBs if possible.  During the burst phase its somewhat impractical to wait for a single persons ATB to fill up  times in a row.  And if youre lifesiphoning as usual youll probably have  full SB gauges on your DPS anyways.  So you really only need entrust if you want to chain together more than  SBs IMO.

Cloud   R Lifesiphon  R Drain Strike | Blade Beam Red XIII   R Full Break  Power Breakdown | Lunatic High Leon   R Armor Break  R Armor Strike | Hand of the Emperor Rinoa   R Meteor  R Dispel | Shared Protectga also Angel Bolt which I didnt use Eiko   R Curaga  R Slowga | Emerald Light unusedRW SGPlan was to use LH at the start quickly Slow one of the guards because as I found out Eiko wouldnt have time to do that any time after round  get defensive breaks up on Vossler and begin meatballingbeating down the guards once P was imminent Id pop SG and HotE then refresh Protect via Rinoa partway through I was worried about insufficient LH charges all the while keeping Cloud high with Drain Strike and using Lifesiphon when he was full while spot healing people who were very low with Eiko.  After dispelling the P Enrage Id drop him a bit more then recast LHSGHotE and proceed to cornhole him through P with BB.Things that happenedP and P were very smooth though I had to actually have Eiko attack herself as up through midway into P no one hit her and I was worried shed get wrecked by a Double Strike.Cloud had a full SB bar all  charges I mean not far into P...so I stupidly used BB which combined with a hey shes not otherwise busy Meteor from Rinoa and the odd Break damage meant I was all but in P without recasting all my buffs.  I managed to get LH and HotF off before he was pushed via Drain damage but not SG or my breaks...Vosslers fourth P attack was an unWalld likely unbreaked quad on Cloud hitting him for k he didnt die but this meant Vossler started smacking EVERYONE else with it.  Rinoa was thankfully defending when he attacked next but Red XIII was killed by the next one.At this point Cloud wasnt top health and while I got SG off in the interim I thought I was going to lose someone...but apparently Eiko and Rinoa were at the same  so he split his next quad between them which they managed to survive.  He died to an Armor Strike and Drain Strike right after.Super tense and I wouldnt have mastered if I hadnt happened to have those two at the same .

6647786,0,t3_46npyl,I feel like most of the pure DPS BSSBs are flatout better than SSBs because of Burst commands and assorted DPS boosts. The  stat boost helps even if you ATK cap not always possible since it increases your SPDDEFRES too I believe.I mean Ive got  of the best ones Lightning Tyro and PLD Cecil and I use Lightnings all the time. Ill probably start using PLD Cecils all the time when I finish getting him to  and just drop Gilgamesh from my A team. I mean his BSSB will make Banishing StrikeSaint Cross deal way more damage after Burst mode ends and during Burst mode hes either AOEing for about  to all or doing   selfheals to single targets.Things that are drawbacks for some BSSBs  Fariss is not as great as I thought because Frans SSB is the same base effect Full Breakdown on an enemy for s and the burst commands are spammable higher damage versions of MagicPower Breakdown. Tyros BSSB is honestly really good to the point that I cant complain that the combo breaks are just regular breaks because theyre unique and stack with Full BreakBreakdownsFrans SSB or Fariss BSSB.There are definitely some crappy BSSBs though   Sephiroths is kinda weak and Im talking about both the SB part and the Burst commands.   Yunas is just awful because one Burst command works best with a DPS mage and the other works with a healer. Its not a very good SB either.   I like Terras but a lot of people rate it low because it takes a lot longer to set it up. I think thats an acceptable reason but the power if you use it as an RW on your best black mage is incredible.A huge bonus to BSSBs at least in my experience  DPS BSSBs tend to sustain themselves just by using the Burst commands. If I have really bad luck then maybe Lightning or PLD Cecil wont have their BSSB ready when Burst mode ends but its pretty reliable that I can recast it after Burst mode expires. And for PLD Cecil that even leads to a huge damage buff from the enHoly effect making the nd cast generally do x AOE.,FFRecordKeeper,d06xt3n,1,t5_3779b

6720448,0,t3_47jr4i,Setup Some people have been saying how everyone only talks about the Ultimate fights now so heres roughly what my comp looked like.The main thing here is that Tauntaliate eliminates literally all of the damage in the fight. The event guide on KBP says that the Lashing Strike counter is all targets but its not everything in that fight is single target. Advance is good if your gear isnt great but even if you have good gear Id probably still use Draw Fire  Retaliate because fuck it. Mines are also mostly a nonconcern as long as you dont try to squeeze in one last spell before defending.UltimateSetup Death Medals SBs Sentinel Grimoire Attack Reels more for DPS than the magic breakdown Soothing Aroma on YunaMy takeaway from this if you go for an attack boost Seymour will drop like a god damn rock which means you need to be very careful with timing your burns and having mitigation ready again ASAP. My pattern going into the kill was Protectga ASAP then Yuna had enough time for one Curaja on Auron who used Drew Fire then she had to sit and wait to recast Protectga once Seymour hit Weak. I actually winced when Lulu immediately got Blood of Espers procs because that would push into Weak so much faster than almost anything else. If I redid it Id probably use Devotion to make Meteor always do  damage so I can guarantee an absorb.I didnt even bother trying to get SG up for the Weak phase because outside of one unlucky AoE Waterga his overall damage wasnt too bad and I wanted to focus on having Magic Breakdown on both Seymour and Mort before Very Weak which also comes very quickly. That was around when Gravija happened and I started to wish Id brought another shared medica for Lulu who could spare some time.Going into Very Weak I had Auron recast Flames of War Tyro started SG Wakka did a Tempo Flurry on Mort to maybe refresh slow and Lulu started casting the Meteor that would push him over. At that point I just had to hope Id get most of my mitigation up before Total Annihilation and at that point as long as people werent at a sliver of health I was in the clear.I had a few shitty RNG SLs two Flares in a row and I guess I had let Breakdown fall off Sap never applied Mort refused to get slowed or had it apply super early then fall off going into Very Weak etc. Seymour has so many skills that there are a lot of combos you wont really think about or expect that can fuck you. Too many little AoEs meant Yuna couldnt keep up with healing and recasting Protectga hence the desire for a shared medica on Lulu and eventually attrition wrecks you.I cant decide if I think Ultimate Dispel is set in a bad place not the second but the first.  feels so early that it really fucks with your rhythm and then  is similarly so early that once you get mitigation up afterwards its really hard for Seymour to be a major threat.I also feel that while Tauntaliate is a decent,FFRecordKeeper,d0egaqf,1,t5_3779b

6780142,0,t1_d0kmb9v,I agree with this.    For MAG users i use Ruinaga R Meteor R Valefor and Maduin R. But this is mainly for trash... and in that respect there are quite a few single enemy high level trash fights which make AoE MAG wasted.    So for major AoE fights i absolutely favor my Physical multihit AoEs Lightnings SSB Crushing Blow  AoE Sabins Razor Gale  AoE party ATK up Cids Air Strike  AoE interrupt chance Jechts Jecht Beam  AoE ATK up... as well as hybrid STAoEs in Clouds BSSB Fenrir Overdrive  ST attacks with Burst Mode AoE if needed and Squalls Fated Circle  ST and  AoE.     My personal luck with the game has me understandably favoring Physical parties. I wish i had a Samurai with a good AoE SB... Flashing Blade is sweet!

I think getting all of the  elemental summons to R is a good plan of action with the eventual summon buff. That being said I dont know what is needed for the abyss dungeon. R may be enough for Abyss but bringing it to R now will help you a lot in this fight. Just start this battle with using Ifrit and use Valefor once you run out.Thats only if you plan to use double summons on Yuna. Honestly I think Valefor amp Ifrit on Yuna and Curagaja amp Shellga on Yshtola is a better way to go. If Diaga is consistently hitting Bahamut for  damage it may be worth keeping but otherwise youre splitting your damage and defensehealing up too much and sacrificing the AOE potential of another summon. If you stay with your current setup Valefor is probably better than Ifrit since its R and hits Bahamut harder.,FFRecordKeeper,d0ne5zw,1,t5_3779b

6827354,0,t3_498k15,Your words echo mine.  Some might leap to comments which in one word are negative.  I was ready to quit though hardly raging.  Im a completionist so mastering is a core requirement for me its a challenge however when a challenge is done poorly then it causes a lot of frustation and annoyance.  If it wasnt for the official site nowadays reddit and  kongbakpau Id have given up on FFRK because even with my knowledge of FF theres no way Id be able to plan for some battles. Im finding  Im losing to RNG.  Im not losing to skill or setup just RNG. The increasing dependence on trinity possibly tetraquint if you add boost and multihit ssbbsb.Im all for challenge and unpredictabilty but I guess I think of it as losing to luckRNG rather than losing because of skill.  Its like losing in Mario Kart because of the blue shell.  In an MMO I play there wasstill is an issue where you could get one shotted despite having full health and no graphic was displayed though this is more a bug.  A battle can be done in one go and be a challenge still....or be many SL later and be a challenge but be a negative experience.Ive only spent p on this and its the last Ill spend.  The rewards for master may just be orbs but those that beat it get orbs to further boost themselves to meet the new challenges and those that dont lose out so wont get the added hones or abilities to meet the challenges that theyre struggling at let alone the new ones.  Theyd essentially be falling behind on the development curve.  Granted those that beat it want a juicy reward but if thats linked to the curve then it becomes a problem.For me practically all the content is too easy.  I dont have a problem with it was its story filler and for lower players.  Ive been able to master all the ultimates with a comfortable challenge but some have been simple and some have been RNG.  As time goes on I see things getting worse and if I cant masterbeat the content thats a challenge then maybe I should quit sooner rather than later instead of spending more time and effort.  I accept that my view is based on me as a person and maybe I could change my perception but if such a smal part of the gameplay presents a fun and fair challenge then theres no shame in walking away just takes some doing because this game can be and is fun...mostly.,FFRecordKeeper,d0q6i3f,1,t5_3779b

Though you still need to finish before he uses Megaflare unless everyone is super healthy.Another option is Fenrir Overdrive RW on Sephiroth that way you can use that to burst down the  turn orbs.  And then Sephiroth himself gets the stacking ATK buff and Haste and can Quad Cut Bahamut while everyone else does one final round of Double Cuts on him.Fenrir might be the most reliable way to deal the damage you need but then youre going to be taking a lot more damage earlier on due to no Wall.  Aura should help a lot and you should keep your healer Hasted so they can keep healing everyone up.

Strong aoes like Seymours total annihilation or petaflare are on the upper end while the typical spammy ones are more like  after mitigation. Autolife heals a minimum of  per person and mitigates however much damage you took when you died. You dont use it with the intention of dying to get back health though but sometimes it just happens especially late into ultimate fights. Even if your mitigation didnt drop the damage gets insane.The dispel upon dying is really bad but if I had autolife id probably switch to ATKMAG down instead of SG.,FFRecordKeeper,d0udequ,1,t5_3779b

I have found the doublehit and Thunderstroke RMs to be good for replacing a doublecut on someone to open up something like a breakdown and thunderstroke on the WHM allows for additional dps when not healing.  Not having any pieces of the trinity has made the haste spell invaluable on one of my accounts and it usually ends up on Celes since it helps her charge SB gauge for an additional magic shell.  Furthermore Cloud has been a better alternative than Gilgamesh for a great deal of the battles because he has better offensive stats level  vs.  and can use tempoflurry which has a faster casttime and allows for more actions.

6894729,0,t1_d0xpypv,Alright so I looked up Honda Civic in the US Canada and UK. First thing I noticed? How much I hate looking up cars. After that I did a lot of reading and looking up and comparison only to realize I actually missed the point of your statements. So I went back and just looked up the differences between a sedan a coupe and a hatchback. Im gonna admit upfront a lot of this went over my head. Im not a car person. I dont understand cars well enough and I likely never will. With that in mind my general understanding was as follows. Sedans always have four doors. Coupes always have two. Hatchbacks can be either depending on the size.. Hatchbacks offer more cargo space than Sedans do. Access of this cargo space is also different and plays into the space as the trunks of a sedan are normally something that lies flat and moves away from the rear window. When you open the hinges are below the window and the trunk rises up to block the window. However in a hatchback that flat part is gone. Instead the entire care extends most of that length... I cant think of the right term to describe it but I remember when I was a little kid my family drove a Volkswagon that was basically a hatchback. Conceptually I can see what it is in my head.So youre argument is based on this idea of... why cant you get a Honda Civic hatchback like they have in the UK if you live in Canada or the US? And youre right on this why cant you? Well... youll be able to soon if not already as theyre bringing the hatchback back. At least in Canada. I dont know about the US.But this is actually something interesting to look at. Why? Because they once did offer hatchbacks. They stopped offering them in . In addition the ones theyre offering during this year are being imported from the UK... and I think this is where the answer lies for why hatchbacks are offered in the UK while sedans and coupes are in CanadaUS. Different plants make different cars. While the Coupe and Sedan models are fairly similar with the primary difference being doors the hatchback is pretty different. As such there are no plants in Canada or the US MAKING them. They only have so many resources to make cars and their plants are set up to only make certain models.Now in some regard this would be comparable to FFRK. After all the people producing the Global release arent the main devs. However theres some differences between cars and a game that need to be considered.... Each car model basically has its own dev team behind it. By this what I mean is... either each model is designed by a central dev team or each model has their own teams with several members working in all of the teams to ensure consistency. FFRK has one dev team behind it for Japan and then the translating team for Global. Im gonna come back to this in a moment.. Each car model is effectively competition with other models. So what this means is that if youre producing all three models in a single country you either have to make less of each or they end up competing with one another unintentionally. Sure some people may prefer the hatchback over the sedan forever but some people are more open. They see pros and cons in both and then can only choose one. However FFRK doesnt compete with itself at least not to that degree. The easiest way to explain what I mean is by example Say Honda makes all three models of Civic in a single country at quantities of  each. So with  cars they get  buyers.  cars arent being sold. I mean sure they eventually will maybe but hopefully as my example goes on youll see what Im getting at. So they have  unsold cars. By comparison there are two versions of the game Japan and Global. So now players have to choose between the two. However people who cant read Japanese likely wont play the Japan client. I cant I dont. In addition its not like theres a limited quantity of the game. Its a smart phone game. It has unlimited quantity. Theres no increased cost for every car made its just the translation cost. So this is kinda different. Not having an inventory cost changes how you can look at it.Now I want to go back to the first point the one about dev teams. You said yourself that its likely the Japanese dev team programmed SLG. Probably. That seems very likely. However if the translation team tries to do stuff and stuff breaks because say the programming doesnt behave with what they put in... what do they do? They need to get it fixed. If they dont want their own devs to deal with that during product testing at the very least they need easy access to the main dev team and the main dev team needs to have the capabilities to fix these sorts of problems without impacting their own development.And before you bring up That wouldnt happen Ive seen cases in MMORPGs where changing one spell for one class ends up breaking the code of another spell for a completely different class. These things shouldnt even intersect yet they do. Things can easily go wrong in programming its actually amazing to watch.My point here is that if they dont have their own devs who work primarily on the global version and know how the game itself works probably because they work with the main team constantly which is how consistency would be maintain then the main team has to be easily accessible and able to do stuff. So then the question becomes... why cant the main dev team do it? They clearly have to be able to do product testing and fix problems before they release to Global so either way there has to be devs who are connected with the team. Why cant DeNA be all Okay lets get one person to make this event for Global? Software development is one of those things that can be very hard to do at the beginning but once you have a system in place its a lot easier. Look at the way fights are now. Once you make the programming for any specific enemy or boss you can just plug it in anywhere. The only things that really need more programming are bosses that need more mechanics to build onto Typically Ultimate fights relics and abilities... and since Im not advocating for unique abilities just to get ones weve not been given that means its just relics and the hardest fights... and even then relics can be based on other relics and thus share code.,FFRecordKeeper,d0xu3o8,2,t5_3779b

6925139,0,t1_d112mml,Albeit a bit too long Im glad were having this discussion. Thank you for sparing the time for it. Now lets goFor the record it was you who rated the banner using Stat Sticks. My whole thread was focused on SBs. In that regardgtHow is that different from the Japan Banner? On their Banner was Maduins Horn and  Statsticks together with the Hairpin!On ours it is Hopes SSB and one Stat stick. You already said you do not count stat sticks! So its a magic SSB and the hairpin.Both Hairpins Banners aside from the obvious Lulus Focus SB cant even be compared. Global have Hopes SSB that while is a SSB is worse than Maduins Horn for being a Thrown Weapon its for a character not as good as Terra and have a Elemental attached to it can be good or bad wont argue about it. Global have Eikos Medica against JPs Hymn of the Fayth. While Yunas Medica is a bit weaker it have the nice Regen effect against the useless Reraise. Then JP still have the nice Exdeaths Runic SB as a bonus. Then theres the physical relics. Yes its a Mage Team thread but for those occasions where youre obligated to use physical theres no comparision between SquallsLockes SSBs JP against RedXIIIsTyros SSBs.Yes I agree with you that JPs Hairpin Banner wasnt aweasome to begin with but Global made it worse.gtLulus SSByay  Magic for Lulu but you wont use the SSB as you want to use FocusVivis SSByay Mag for Vivi who is a glasscanon often no longer recommendedRinoaSSB okay that SSB might even be usedKefkas Cloakalready said good relicRydiasSBanother Glasscanonand NO HAIRPIN!. Not bad but no Hairpin either and two chars that often get send off for being to squishy.Lulus Doll can be used by Tyro if you want him to be a Black Mage not likely tho and by herself. While yes you wouldnt use the SSB if you have the Hairpin you certainly would if you DONT get the Hairpin.Vivi being glasscanon isnt entirely true. I mean all Mages are to some degree but thats diminished by staying in back row against physical and Vivi have the th highest RES in the game. Yes his HP is kinda low but just another reason to say that Eikos higher Medica makes almost no difference against Yunas Medica. Same goes for Rydia.Kefkas Cloak is by itself a really good Mage SB. Its not as game breaking as Scream is to physical teams but its a trinity piece  faithga boostga personally I think Boostgas should be part of the trinity hence a quadnity? so theres  pieces of it in there.So in the end JPs other mage banner that dont have Hairpin in it is also better than Globals. Again I agree that JPs wasnt aweasome but again Global made it worse.And to end it gtExdeaths Branchdismissed as Stat stick by youI dismissed it as Stat Stick? Again I made this topic with SBs in mind not Stat Sticks and Exdeaths Branch surely is a great SB to have.While I know theres no way to have a perfect mage banner anything along JPs thinking with  banners with good SBs would be acceptable. Putting  SSB in each banner and putting Hairpin on the worst banner is indeed enough to say those banners suck.,FFRecordKeeper,d11af6s,1,t5_3779b

6986134,0,t1_d184d5f,Ugh theres no way to discuss things without examples and real numbers. You can say your assumption of numbers is not fair because of A and heres a better assumption of numbers but dismissing everything as example would be bad. And heres my major point there are two different issues price and RNG system. When you say the system is bad you need to propose a different system with the price being similar. You cannot propose a different system with a lower price and say I prefer this system better  of course we all like a system with lower price but thats not merit of different system its merit of lower price. Current system is  for pull so whats an equivalent pricetag system that doesnt involve RNG? Marketing all relic at  isnt an equivalent system because relics have vastly different strength. An equivalent system would be at least marketing different relics at different price with highpower relic like Wall sold at higher than   would probably be fair and lowpower relic like stat stick or shared SB sold at lower than   while the average price for a relic being . and lets say everything  or lower are farmable or basically free This system in my opinion would be equally extorting to players and not less annoying than RNG. Alternatively imagine a system that offers  per pull instead of . Do you prefer this system lower price with RNG or the previously described system higher price with no RNG? I personally think  per pull is fair and a system I can accept while  per pull is too much which is why I do gems and not regular pulls. On the other hand I probably wouldnt pay  to buy Sentinel Grimoire but I can imagine some people would like it. ,FFRecordKeeper,d187vv2,1,t5_3779b

6999444,0,t3_4bjpee,Lucky Banners dont have increased drop rate bonus its the same as regular banners.Regarding your incapability of clearing content when people are clearing stuff you say you cant with Cores and no  premium relics then problem is your hones and strategy not your equipment. Maybe try to ask for advice with your current resources or try to plan ahead to what is coming. Maybe it wont be enough for the Ultis but at least all other fights can be cleared. Especially the ones that can be cheesed with Retaliate.That said this will probably be all for naught as you seem to have made your decision. I know what it feels like to feel frustrated and jealous of all the incredible pulls people make. Fortunately I am able to channel those negative feelings into the game and man does it feel good to own those Ultis with my limited resources. The TAKE THAT moment when you shove it to the game is worth so much more than pulling a good relic. At least you know you did it with your hard work and personal investment and not because the game RNG pulled the number that gave you a jackpot.Try to at least do the orbfest and XTactics events and then quit. If you ever feel the need to come back that will bite you in the rear so much  Dont even log to this sub reddit just do your thing so you can avoid all other pulls and reduce those negative feelings.

7007268,0,t3_4bmr20,Heh I like your style. I too have both the Headband and Shield and have Yuffie as a permanent member now.  ampnbsp  I really like her equipment and skill set choice since it allows her to fill multiple roles. Personally I mostly run her with Thiefs Revenge and Dismissal as I also run Tyro with Full Break and a Breakdown. Generally unless I specifically need both Magic and Power breakdown I tend to only run Magic Breakdown.  ampnbsp  However something I do like to do is run Steal Defence instead of DismissalSteal Power. This is because Thiefs Revenge is a multi hit ability which doesnt cap out on damage easily like say Dismissal or other single hit abilities.  ampnbsp  Even with Yuffie at  Synergy gear Flames of War  Atk Hand of the Emperor  Attack and Full Break on the boss she was still hitting for .k per hit on Thiefs Revenge. Meaning that it could be even further improved with Armour Breakdown or Steal Armour.  ampnbsp  Id also advice to give her an SB increasing RM if shes your only AoE heal. While it is instant she cannot make use of Lifesiphon so it would take a while to get her SB gauge up high enough in the more difficult fights. ,FFRecordKeeper,d1amalu,1,t5_3779b

7022249,0,t3_4bto6x,Its actually two different questions. . Is paying any money into this game worth it? The answer depends on you. I personally think that  per month is a fair expense on a game that I play this often. . If I pay any money is it wise to spend on gem pulls? The answer is yes. gem pulls offer the best gemtomythril ratio in game compared to pulls or using gems to restore stamina. Even if you take banner quality into account its worth it. As a simple comparison say you spent  in this game. If you spend them all on gem pulls and you have average luck that means   relics possibly including  SSB  regular SBs and  blank item. If you spend then all on pulls that means   relic and even if you spend it on SSBFest banner  it may only result you in  regular SB. ,FFRecordKeeper,d1cbnbj,2,t5_3779b

What Id suggest is maybe focus more on single target takedowns rather than AoE takedowns.Bring Bioga and Blizzaga on Maria and swap blindga for dark buster on Gordon. The gameplan is to kill off the Fire Gigas while your first wall is still active and kill the Ice Gigas without Wall.

You also get  damage reduction on magical damage and  reduction on physical damage which if we assume  per round for  rounds would be  assuming  split but magical is usually much more than physical in total or maybe we can double that to be . So  in total. Can thiefs revenge reliably heal more than  per shot? Yes and whats the value for that?

Ice has been her image element since the original game and is reflected in her RM that turns attack into blizzard strike while Wind is something theyve kind of tacked on to her with Spinning Edge etc. If she gets a BSSB in her upcoming event it wouldnt surprise me if those elements are reflected in her BSSB as well.,FFRecordKeeper,d1gd84n,1,t5_3779b

You are making a scenario where Ramza himself is built around mnd why couldnt Quistis be also? And with ja spells I really cant see Quistis doing low damage. Another thing to consider is that they dont share the same role. Quistis is clearly a mage while Ramza is a support.Now if  seconds isnt worth it then the discussion is pointless. Just put any of the two doesnt matter how much time their hastega is.,FFRecordKeeper,d1ptqnr,0,t5_3779b
7141138,0,t3_4dcqgf,Ive been thinking about this as well. And my only real thought is that much like having Native Wall opens up lots of RW options so too would having Native Shout. Sure not all the time will there be a perfect RW that isnt a trinity piece but in those cases more medica cant hurt. As for how Tyro can fit in if Ramza is taking the support role and you have a dedicated WM I think with full RS gear Tyro can do decent enough damage just dont stick Thief Revenge on him lol and as someone else pointed out there is a possibility to grab SLG from the beginner banner and run a lifesiphon build where Tyro casts SG once at start off Mako Might or a couple turns in to max duration during harder phases and then again around . And then at  if the rest of your team is going off with SSB Spam just drop an SLG and kill the boss instead of reapplying wall. Clearly some juggling to do but this is a game after all so...go ham. Or maybe the simpler way to put it is that as someone who has used Tyro since the first SG banner back in was it June ? he has never felt like a disappointment and I think he gets a lot of unwarranted hate from people. Maybe its his dorky hat? So I have no doubt he will continue to play a role even with Ramza on the team. ,FFRecordKeeper,d1pvd18,1,t5_3779b

7144651,0,t3_4dbhzv,Its always a hard choice to help friends out since youll generally have several different relics.Currently have Ramzas Shout Tyros Sentinels Grimoire Red XIIIs Lunatic High Garnets Divine Guardian Leons Hand of the Emperor Yuffies Clear Tranquil and Selphies Trabias Light.Choices are Tyros SG  Amazing DEF and RES increase and generally what you need to pass highleveled content. Garnets Divine Guardian  With a Hastega High Regen and RES increase this is better than Boon the old SB everyone would have died to get. Leons Hand of the Emperor  This is downright amazing since this if I remember correctly is a  increase in team ATK and DEF which seems ok if not for the fact that this literally stacks with many other stat boosters including Ramzas Shout. Red XIIIs Lunatic High  Basic Hastega and Protectega. Still reliable but probably going to be less used as compared to others boosters. Ramzas Shout  This is apparently the best booster in the game with  increase in ATK and Hastega. Also stacks with many other boosters including HOTE so you will most likely hit the soft cap with this and another booster. However many others will pull Platinum Sword so its likely theyll chance their RWs to this so I probably wont choose this. Selphies Trabias Light  A strong CuragaLevel team heal. Thats it. Yuffies Clear Tranquil  If it works like the SB does itd be an instantcast RW team heal at Curalevel. Not amazing heal but since its CuraLevel and instant cast it makes this a bit desirable.,FFRecordKeeper,d1q9s7e,1,t5_3779b

It was ridiculous that we had characters without MCs for a long time.  When they started rolling out MCs anyone who appeared in a festival banner Firion or from a realm with MCs reissued Edward should have gotten theirs.  It was very logical to assume Tifa would suffer the same fate SirWill had a long debate with someone on the Gamefaqs board about this same topic and I agreed with him.  I think my disagreement with trusting versus assuming is that I assume see what I did there that most casual players have no idea what we know.  If you just logged in and played some each day and did not minmax like a lot of us you have no idea what the drop rate is what future banners look like etc.  We do and we assume that everything will mostly stay the same.

7168675,1,t3_4dox0c,Ill have to vehemently disagree this fight had a large amount of RNG to it from whether or not Blind landed on OrmiLogos to how many times Leblanc used No Love Lost to wipe out all your buffs.  Followed up by how many rain of bullets you would take after buffs were wiped out before you could reapply them.  Definitely a very very rngy fight.  I had to sl dozens of times before I finally had a run where I was able to get all buffs back up before I absorbed a major attack and lost someone.  That was with doing everything rightKeeping ormilogos blinded killing Leblanc first keeping everyone topped off and a SG ready to go at a moments notice.  Still grats on the win it was my first Ultimate win just a very frustrating fight overall.  hours spent trying to beat it and rng still nearly screwed me out of mastery when Ormi reapplied drawfire moments after I had blinded him.  Thankfully rng was on MY side and my very last blind use landed so I could kill Logos before Ormi.Even the writers over Kongbakpao list the fight as heavily rngbased as evidenced by this blurb taken directly from their page on the fight This can be a very frustrating fight with so many RNG elements Russian Roulette trying to Blind Ormi and Logos etc just be patient and you should do fine!,FFRecordKeeper,d1t0ejk,5,t5_3779b

Itd take around five drops to get enough for a Major.Unless you only need ONE of the three orb types in a Fest though Id still say Orbfest is going to be better.

7294530,0,t3_4fa16c,I like how you explain the basics and necessary things for a beginner and try to aim to set up the game with a low bar casually playing reasonable pulls using mainly standard characters obtained through the story rather than events so players hopefully can quickly start up the game. Most important you dont really go into the dungeons themselves but rather go into the information they need to know to play the game. Having an hour vid doing dungeons would be rather boringPOff topic i always pronounced it as gaisahl greens like you do but its more like guisahl greens like in the sound gui in guitar source final fantasy  lightning returnsPEdit after watching your vid it might be useful going into the different ability schools. For example black magic is useful regardless of weakness though its better if there is weakness unlike the physical counter part spellblade is only useful if the enemy is weak. The damage multiplier of spellblades is low and therefore a skill with an effect break or whatever tends to have a favour over spellblades in non weakness aspects. In addition to that  spellblades are sufficient for hitting weakness while for magic you want to aim to get the  version.Same can be said about breakdowns and dances. Breakdowns are single but do damage and are easier to equip a character on while dances are aoe but do no damage and are difficult to find characters for.Maybe you should highlight the usefulness of combat skills early on. Every physical character can use combat skills and therefore honing combat skills really give lots of benefits to new players as they are always usable.,FFRecordKeeper,d27c79l,1,t5_3779b

I will continue to use it every time I use Lightnings SSB until the end of timeuntil I get a several better other elemental boosting gear that she can equip unlikely. It makes her SSB much more powerful and stacks. Even when her SSB is no longer the best lightning attack itll still be a viable choice and any future lightning based SBSSBBSSBs on other chars that can equip it may be enhancedTyros SLG etc. Its an equip that is timeless. Plus it has great stats.For the last pieceWhile the  DEF isnt much its still something. Even if its a double digit difference big numbers are built on small ones. Reduces a percentage of the damage and helps Major Regen keep up particularly since swordslike Lit Steel keep Lightning on the front row and other Kaiser Shield users like Tyro SLG are already quite squishy. My Lightning Steel atm is  and does not get used outside of FFX because it simply cannot keep up with enough ATK boost to validate the damage boost vs its RS competition. Even max augmented it cannot. Wont until I can get it  at the very least probably .

In particular I appreciated the headsup when Steam had an FF sale going on a few months back and general FF polls are quite fun.And why would posting an image from FF be less relevant to the FFRK subreddit than the FF one? FFRK has FF characters storyline gear bosses and scenarios. For those of us who have played it reliving the series is part of the fun of FFRK. The Final Fantasy subreddit exists because the Final Fantasy series exists. The FFRK subreddit exists because the FFRK game exists. And actually rFinalFantasyIX also exists so if everyone posted strictly on topic there would be no reason for rFinalFantasy at all. Reddit would implode from the principle of mutual exclusion. So lighten up and just enjoy reading what you came here to read.,FFRecordKeeper,d2rzjyx,0,t5_3779b

Yes that could work Luneth can operate in a vacuum LifesiphonSpellblade gt Advance gt Full Charge and youll be able to pump out big phys damage.

Its unrealistic to think that players would have clamored for transparency at the games start. And if we missed that opportunity then when exactly do you suggest players start clamoring? The FFT fiasco was as good a time to start since it shook the playerbase with the real ramifications of what a lack of transparency can entail.The FFT event was a terrible time to stage what was basically a fastburning fire.Which do you think would have a larger impact? Shortlived bursts of emotional outrage during a period of immense hype. A series of coordinated protests while things are quiet and emotions are in check.gt Getting DeNA to provide transparency would basically involve a game of chicken where we players would have to be willing to let global FFRK burn to the ground in order to get DeNA to swerve first.Now were getting somewhere.  The question is...can someone convince enough whales and coordinate?

That doesnt mean all r or r if you run out of abilities  of the way through your boss fight then theyre not doing you the most good.

Tempo Flurries are maxed Full Break is at R MBDShellgaProtectga at R Dismissal and Banishing Strike at R. Also  great point regarding Agrias Protectga. I usually use the first Tailwind right after the first Gravija so my only concern is making it up to that point with no physical mitigation aside from wall. To answer your other question though his physical damage isnt really a problem for me with everything up I just tend to hit unlucky streaks involving GravijaMeteorUltimaUltima Weapon.

Luckily I pulled SG so maybe and only maybe I will be able to clear some U.Im definetely pulling in a couple of hours on IV so I hope the trend changes or Im on the same boat.The thing is the difficulty is not at all consistent. We all saw how OP was Bahamut SIN for its difficulty. And Cid U on XII was actually a joke. I did it easily with a synergy party no Wall and no synergy armors of any kind. And my weapons were not at all over the top. First Frans bow and a couple of s some combined. I didnt even use any SBs during the fight!

You can hold that against her sure.Her attack stat hasnt been relevant since they added Steal Power since that plus a good RS weapon should get her near if not to the soft cap. She was likely a better attacker than anyone without Thief  between that and the release or Shout really.Unless you had Planet Protector in which case shes likely always had enough attack.I guess her mind is a little low for Lullaby or ProtectgaShellga the paladins have her beat there.

7812218,0,t3_4mavqe,To everybody the oldtimers and curious newcomersEvery couple months XI has a freelogin period. It usually lasts for a weekend to a week most recent one was in May and lasted  days. If you ever had an XI character youll be able to log in during this time. If youre totally new Im sure theres still the first  days of free playtime but if that expired and youre still not sold on subscribing you can just play during the free login periods and get your XI in short installments.Me and my SO quit a couple years ago after playing for about  years we were sick of SEs bullshit. But we still come back for every free login period and try to make a little progress toward beating the game theres a final boss and also do new Adoulin missions and quests thatve been added since we quit and old quests we never got around to. Oh and for those who dont know how the game has changed leveling up solo is now SUPER easy. Getting around the world is now incredibly convenient with all sorts of teleport points and summonable mounts any time you need them. Records of Eminence is a new form of quest objectives that shower you with Exp and other rewards. Oh and Trust NPCs. You can now summon pretty much any notable NPC to party alongside you. Prishe Shantotto Zeid Lion Tenzen you name it theyve got it. So almost everything in the game can be done solo with an NPC party should you choose.,FFRecordKeeper,d3u5p4b,5,t5_3779b

Heck you even said that Rise of the Zilart would take  to  dungeons minimum.  CoP mission  was longer by itself than the entire Rise of the Zilart expansion.  And thats just one mission in CoP.  There were  chapters to Chains of Promathia expansion and all of them had at least  missions in each chapter.  Plus the extra stuff like the Storms of Fate Bahamut fight and Apocalypse Nigh.

That is a Nodachi and a Wizard Armlet both items I would be willing to wager most long time players have since they are both rather common  pulls.Without synergy equips he still does k damage per turn reliably with it And this is constant reliable damage against anything that isnt fully immune to physical damage? since it ignores def.

7881207,0,t1_d41r7wk,The SaGa Collab started when a regular event would have started and instead of waiting a full week they squeezed the X event in a weird time frame. I forget when it launched on a Monday I think? The XIII event went back to the regular schedule so we just have all three running at once and will add the IV event on Friday.As to why the X event is running a few extra days and ending at the same time as the XIII one Im not sure. If you were cynical you could say its because DeNA knows its got a crazy good banner attached to it and wanted to keep it open as long as possible to try and get extra sales from it.The last two Nightmare Dungeons have changed the Lucky Draw a bit the only relics for characters with that  skill set is now a standard mythril banner and theres a differently themed lucky draw that comes a few days prior the last two have been stat down relics like Kaiser Shield Faris BSB etc and stat up relics Platinum Sword the Walls etc. I dont think the theme of the next one has been announced yet.

7881960,0,t3_4n9kle,Alright no Cid and no Kain Wardrobe.How much for a Pitchfork?Edit I need to do a LIST of the things wrong with this event for me by preview. No Cid. Why? Cid is a main playable character and yet several realms are sporting multiple NPCsantagonists X has freaking BRASKA and its not like hes the only new piece of IV content they could add. Kain has no wardrobe record. You make the event Kain themed not Baron themed KAIN themed and dont take the chance to add his Holy Dragoon Dress Record? Sequel withholding isnt the explanation because Yuna and Rikku have their X designs and you scraped for such brilliant ideas as ShortHaired Garnet as opposed to Queen or White Mage Robe and Shirtless Sephiroth with a cumulative  minutes of game time. What is with the character roster? Tellah? The Twins? Freaking EDWARD getting a Burst? I dont have anything against the characters themselves but what do most of these guys have to do with Kain? I dont think Kain exchanges dialogue with ANY of them hell he doesnt even meet the Twins!. Meanwhile Rosa is recycling her old SSB when logically she should be getting a Burst. Why is this the one you skipped the Healer Burst for?! Maybe this is repeating the point but the random character assortment irks me for another reason. Why hijack the Kain event for the neglected IV characters and then still miss FuSoYa? You know a theme that would fit giving them more attention? TAY! Just add Cid here and do TAY to focus on these characters later! This is just doubly egregious to me because on top of not fitting this events theme theres a much more effective choice for this! Titan. Why the hell is he a ? Earth isnt a strong enough element to justify him over Bahamut and hes always been on the level of IfritShivaRamuh. For that matter hes stronger than Leviathan here a Summon that explicitly outranks him in IV. What the hell are these Ultimate choices? . Flan Master was a Palom boss in the bonus dungeon so on top of being for a character with no relation to the events headliner its for half of the Twins who are already featured as a pair anyway. At least if they picked Edwards Abyss Worm itd be for one of the costars burst and all.. White Dragon? This is a moon enemy yet theres no sign of Fusoya the Lunarian or Edge the guy who gets a weapon from this thing. Why not the Plague Horror Holy Lance or a Moon Boss having to do with one of the headliners? Key reports its the Dark Dragon the morphed Dark Elf. Alright this ones not terrible but I still could think of something else Id pick for Edward before this.. Calcabrina. Okay fucking what?! Even in IV itself Calcabrina was kind of a filler boss so why is it something like a U U even as it looks? Again nothing thematically to do with the headlined characters and even as this crowd goes its a really random choice for a U.I mean there were logical choices here Scarmiglione would fit the Twins Tellah and even Pecil if you wanna say A lot of the featured fought Lugaeborg The AntLion covers Edward Rydia and Cecil Golbez is better if you need a Dwarven Castle fight and if you wanna be a bit more out there have a Kain fight based on FabulDark Kain and give him the Dragoon skills like U Sephiroth had the SAM moves.Alright Im done rambling put the pitchforks and torches over there.,FFRecordKeeper,d4207r6,20,t5_3779b

If youre in between .

May be the difference between  and  or . Generic physical FFX is  to me for example since I have more synergy than I can carry. Generic FFVIII is .

Ingus support  knight  niche combination makes him very useful even without his relics. On the other hand Ramza is Knight  Support . Entrust is actually an underrated ability I find it to be very useful for implementation of strategies like in this case passing gauge to Shadow. The downside is that you will only be left with  other skill to use. Tyro being able to use all skills can fill in the gaps where the team is lacking.Agrias being a Paladin is able to cast shell. Shell  wall is a good amount of mitigation required for this battle.Lastly Shadow with his SSB he is amazing.

I didnt state he was better.  I specifically stated I have better options than him.  Im going to do it because I want to and this combo makes it possible for me to do so.  Hence the use of viable and not optimal.gtand as for Gau... I think you better have lots of fists or daggers for RS and a backup character to use these skills in case he doesnt work out all the timeI do have four  fists in different realms and a smattering of daggers in others so Im fairly covered on that front.  I have Lightnings SSB so if I really wanted to go that route its available to me but Id rather just use Powerchain  Lifesiphon on her.  No Gau isnt better than my other SSB users currently in my party but I dont have to play every aspect of this game solely for optimization.  I recognize it is foolish not to play that way but at that point it stops feeling like a game to me so I do stupid things like this to keep it fun thats all.Thanks for looking for me out though.

The poll can be found by clicking the topic title so please report there  do not post your own pulls in this thread as they wont be counted.Responses with no  pulls are removed for the sake of data accuracy  in order to gather more accurate stats on the drop rates of individual items.  This is because of reporting bias people are disproportionately more likely to respond to this poll if they pulled a  on their x or x draw as compared to those who do not pull a .  This causes the reported  rate to increase generally to  for non pulls which reduces the accuracy of the poll considerably.  So to make the results more accurate and more useful to everyone all single pulls  triple pulls will be removed.I cant stress this enough but it is very important that everybody who did  pulls report their results especially those with less spectacular draws.

8089099,0,t3_4q06kn,. Strategy name  No Slaves Here!  . Boss name Kefka Void  . Describe your Strategy An allmagic team here was used to completely negate Kefkas Slave Crown ability.  Other than that it was just simnply whaling on the boss.  Relm was MVP here as all of her attacks did  damage on Kefka in addition to dispelling Kefkas haste when needed.  Kujas SSB came too late as Kefka was nearly defeated by the time it was used.  . Insight!  You can use dances instead of breakdowns in order to bypass Kefkas Slave Crown.  Diaga is MVP here especially if you are using Relm as a damage dealer.  Dont forget that you need at least one black mage in your party no matter what party youre using.  If you own a Magic Boostga its highly recommended to go all magicdance for this fight.. Holy Trinity casts   Wall   Medica None!  Hastega  forgot to use the second haste oops!.

8103180,0,t1_d4qv5wk,That an honest question? You can easily burn out on things that you do everyday no matter how long it could take. Dailies on WoW could burn you out if you dont enjoy doing them and some take just as little time. No matter if you love the game or genre. Completing only the quests in Heroes of the Storm which take anywhere from  minutes depending could cause you to burn out on the game if you dont do anything else or particularly enjoy it. Those are just  examples from other games I play that show that burn out can happen with few minutes of game time per day.Doesnt matter the time required. This game used to be fun but the formula for the game has stagnated the past few months and is getting less enjoyable. So thats why I asked what others do to get past it and get back to enjoying this game that I have enjoyed greatly thus far.,FFRecordKeeper,d4qvck9,3,t5_3779b

And even if Titan is not my favourite summon the animation looks powerful.BUT THIS.Darkness???? The characters that have darkness soulbreaks are all darkness user which are all NOT capable to use  summon. So a combo like AlexanderHoly wont be possible in the darkness version. And while foes with earth weakness are very rare foes with darkness weakness are almost non existent! basically only the enemyversions of the protagonists have darkness weakness. To my knowledge there is no attachdarkness ability on summoners which makes it impossible to use this summon with attachearth unless RW. Also I dont remember if there is an imperil soul break at all.I can only think this ability was thought with a release of Seymour in mind a darknessblackmagesummoner that has some imperil or attach darkness soul breaks wich leads me to my next point... why Ultima instead of Anima????

8171372,0,t1_d4yyepk,Some people already had those items or good synergy in those realms already. Lightning also gets an odd amount of hate and her SSB being AoE is a knock against it to some people. Celes cant use lifesiphon which is a knock against her to some people. Im not saying theyre right but its a reason.People like magic blink more than heavy regen because its useful for cheesing powerful scripted abilities.Theres no defense boost like Beatrix or reverse wall like Mog or Gordon but against slowable enemies Edges is a godsend and DCecil is actually very good now that we have Darkness abilities. Dudes buff. Edwards is also a direct upgrade to Kefka.Something else to keep in mind is that its a purely physical banner for a realm that is often crowded by mages.

My personal lowest point was  on Banner  of BSB Fest. I have been chasing a relic for Pecil for so long ignoring other banners and resisting pulls that it was truly a terrible feeling coming up with that result.I got a  Turk Suit. Awesome eh? Well it actually was.But then I looked at my box and thought I cant say this game has fucked me over so bad that I cant win since I clear UltimatesU in every event that rolls out. This translated to a furious thrashing of the entire Big Bridge Event and the realization that yeah I may have some utterly horrific pulls but I can still wok around with what I have. Then I began to be thankful for what I have Turk Suit included  armor is still good compared to  or  and the pain slowly subsided not instantly but it subsided and is now gone.Sometimes you wont get what you want but thats a good time to take stock of what you do have and be very grateful to have what you have and move on from there.DeNA never promises you the grand prize or ANY prize of ANY Banner.

This animation takes roughly .s realtime so with battle speed  in which ingame time goes at  of what it does at speed  this is reduced to s ingame time.  It can effectively be less if another character takes an action to pause the ingame timer or more if a character does something like a summonSB that removes the action selection UI but a lower battle speed is a good thing for this.There are a few other things to consider like dragoon jump airtime that makes higher speeds nice but in general you want speed  if its a tough fight.,FFRecordKeeper,d5iv4fn,2,t5_3779b

Notes Shout was the RW  but pray you dont get Dispelled and lose your Haste right after it is used! gt Thoughts and advice here  A bit of SL was needed. Very reliant on what Asura does. If she uses ProtectShell on Leviathan it leaves a greatly increased risk of dying to multiple AoEs at the end of the fight. As I had no room for Dispel I had to hope that didnt happen! Amarants role was to provide Shell and Major Regen on the first turn thereafter using Tempo Flurry to Slow Asura and Lifesiphon to rebuild his SB gauge. His ability to SB spam made up for his low MND giving a very short Shell duration. Setzers role was debuff debuff debuff. As I chose the Shout route Prismatic Flash was invaluable in nerfing both bosses early on. Thereafter he alternated Full Break on Asura and Magic Breakdown on Leviathan. Cyans role was DPS with a side of support. Packing Full Charge Lifesiphon and Bushido Bloodmoon he was able to stun both bosses with his SB and buy Devout enough time to heal the party with her shared Medica. Deschs role was secondary DPS. While everyone else whaled on Asura he would use Thundaja to hit for  on Leviathan or Drainga if he needed to heal. By the time Asura was down Leviathan was not much above half health  this was when I broke out Deschs EnLightning SB and went full offense for the rest of the fight. Devouts job was to keep one step ahead of Leviathans AoEs. Protectga was put up on the first turn and refreshed just before Asura went down  every other turn she was healing with Curaja with a few double procs or using her shared Medica SB to try and stem the damage from Leviathans AoE spam.Desch was a huge help and a bargain for . points. If you have a decent rod with IV synergy you dont need his EnLightning SB  hes still well worth bringing along for supporting Thundaja damage on Leviathan while the rest of your team works on Asura. The fact he can heal as well helps your white mage out considerably!,FFRecordKeeper,d5lgxl0,1,t5_3779b

8355102,0,t1_d5lx0mm,Fair but consider that every companys first priority will always be profit regardless of the fact that every business relies on the satisfaction of its customers. Thing is dissatisfaction will always exist and companies in general especially larger ones dealing with a wide customer base will opt to provide models that attempt to please the majority. As long as a significant portion of the customer base are appeased or appear so they will proceed with said model until they experience a decline. Sure they can copypasta the JP banners and just translate text providing people with their percentages but in the broad scheme of things its a thin facade. It changes nothing. Your draw is your draw regardless of if theres a numerical value on the banner or not. And as you say it IS gambling. But it is an individuals choice to gamble and they accept all of the ramifications and responsibilities of that action every time they do so whether with mythril or money. Like the lottery or the casinos they merely provide the means and the temptation. But in the end they will always be in it for the money. Otherwise theyd be a nonprofit organization.If your definition is anything to go by all game development companies are bad. Some just hide it better than others.

8409733,0,t3_4utpdr,Im basing the following advice in the assumption that you have Gordons Goddess Bell and Garnets Divine Guardian.Tyro and Gordon should have Full Break Magic Breakdown Power Breakdown and Mental Breakdown between them. This will drastically cut down Ifrits attacks when paired with Goddess Bell and Divine Guardian.RW someone with Rinoas BSB and use both of them on Rinoa and spam that xIce magic burst ability. Ideally you want to take down some of Ifrits HP first because you really dont want to be casting single Ice magics when Ifrit is in Weak Form.You can use Cloud as a damage dealer or you can replace him with Seifer and use him as a back row Magic LureDraw Fire puppet. Or swap for Selphie and use her as secondary healer and Faith on Rinoa.Of course the above advice is based on the assumption that you have the above SBs to make it work.,FFRecordKeeper,d5srf6a,2,t5_3779b

8410221,0,t1_d5srzox,I have to say that youre overstating the additional time that passes  altogether it maybe adds up to a couple of seconds over the fight.  For example my video above uses no Haste or Hastega other than the  Auto Haste RM and Rinoas BSB RW.  Quistiss Haste lasts a full  turns from battle start she has no MND on her weapon while Selphies lasts . turns  turns   SB.  This seems to be in the range of normal Haste times.I think there may be a misunderstanding here  the reason this trick works is because of the delaying Ifrits turns by taking advantage of player priority and not because of a large amount of time that gets added between attacks.  Remember your teams ATB bars are still filling during the ATB chain while Ifrits ATB is halted.,FFRecordKeeper,d5stluz,8,t5_3779b

8550878,0,t1_d6a3pc0,Im not saying that  GSO is worth  stamina but its not worth  either. Really it should be something in between like StamValueGSO  the stamina cost to get  greensthe stamina value of orbs you would get doing dailies with that  stamina. Using  stamina   converted greaters that ratio is  staminagreater.  So in  stamina you get  greaters. Since  greaters   stamina  greaters is worth  stamina.  So its   . You have just proved that GSOs are less than worthless. Congratulations! Youre still running under the implicit assumption that other orb types are just as important as summon orbs. They arent. You can get more just by waiting. Same with stamina. Yes the rate is limited and its not even limited if you use a mythril to refresh but all you have to do to get more is wait. You cant get summon orbs by waiting only tangentially by using greens for them while farming other orbs but theres no way to increase the rate at which you receive summon orbs since the greens drop rate is fixed unless you mythril refresh but then your assumption about limited stamina fails. This is one of the reasons so many people choose to mythril refresh during the summon orb phases of orbfests. If you just wait with your limited resource free  staminaday you wont get enough. If youre gonna keep harping on limited resources that arent really limited you need to consider rates.Ill agree to think about opportunity costs if you agree to think about scarcity. Did you notice that you have two different ratios for staminagreaters? How did that happen? ,FFRecordKeeper,d6afkoo,1,t5_3779b

8571797,0,t1_d6cw47y,As someone who has played a ton of Brave Frontier I actually prefer their gacha or at least what it was before the omni evolutions came around.Hitting a notable pull on BF had about the same chance as it does here on FFRK  banners typically featured three units each around  or so at the best.  However if you missed a pull you had a decent chance of getting a unit that was a little outdated but still useful.  This is a little less true with the new Omnis coming out unfortunately just because the new evolution tier is so ridiculously powerful  but for a long time in the star era things were pretty good especially with old legacy units getting star upgrades all the time.Meanwhile here in FFRK the gacha rate is awful mostly because missing a banner pull means you get something that is basically worthless junk in comparison.  Im a FP player I didnt get a single star relic in my last five pulls and only once have I ever pulled a relic I specifically wanted on any of the banners Ive ever pulled on.  Those  pulls feel completely awful and it just keeps happening again and again.Of course I keep playing FFRK anyways because the gacha is only half the game and having good hones  which dont require luck  is the other half and the game itself is rather fun.I cant speak for FFBE much since I havent tried it.

8601948,0,t1_d6gf7tw,Actions would be the general term to use. To make it short yes I generally speak of BLK attacks and Black Magic abilities to stress that SB are affected in the former case but not in the latter but the difference is a bit more than that.Actions in the game have a type and a school. Conditional effects like RM and many other things can be based on one or another. Type is generally referred to with three capital letters and can be PHY WHT BLK BLU SUM NAT or NIN. This information is not visible ingame. Since certain schools like Black Magic have the same name as some types its easy to make some confusion hence why the three capital letters convention.  School is generally referred to with the full name and corresponds to the classification of the abilities visible ingame Summoning Knight Ninja Machinist etc.. Soul Breaks dont have a school although Burst Commands do meaning that effects based on an actions school never affect Soul Breaks.With this in mind the difference between type and school can lead to some interesting interactions for example since Rinoas RM boosts BLKtype attacks it can affect Memento Mori and Dark Zone even if theyre not Black Magic abilities.,FFRecordKeeper,d6gu5qj,1,t5_3779b

Being able to pound a boss with  straight uses in the back half of the fight can really speed things up.Thiefs Revenge is more acceptable at r IMO because it adds some utility healing.PCFB is a great combo but I would look to hone them in unison rather than one at a time.,FFRecordKeeper,d6jwbjz,1,t5_3779b

You can and its actually rather advisable to then shatter some or all redundant copies to get a huge increase in your available  Crystals.  R becomes practical for many skills and R is possible for certain skills with enough commitment.More recently in JP Ultimate  staminalevel fights have begun adding  Crystals to their drop list.  Its RNG grindy and a lowincome source of them but they are farmable if you have lots of time and stamina on your hands.

Dont let anyone take out all three in a single wave with an AoE. Aim to reduce their HP quickly then single target each Tonberry.  Using a single type of ability on a single Tonberry helped to ensure that the three were never in line together other than the start of phase two.

8720984,0,t3_4wjmk1,Gah Cuchulainn is a real pain in the dick. Slow sleep and silence are his worst debuffs but stun gets a special mention for knocking Yshotla out of an Asylum cast shortly before killing her. For my part silence is the worst as long as youre a healer because even though lots of people smartly brought Hyper Cure it almost never got used to cleanse anything becayse Cuchulainn is a huge bag of dicks and constantly fucks with you.Id realllllly recommend using status resistance items. I went with the new  star from the omega drive nightmare dungeon it grants large resist sleep and the FF rabbit paw one for the silence resist. I could also see a case being made for the Bio resist bracelet dont use the meteorite necklace thats for poison status not poison damage.Ironically I was actually really glad he has a really dinky physical counter because it meant he was somewhat helpful for waking people up.,FFRecordKeeper,d6vri8o,1,t5_3779b

8734200,0,t1_d6xctku,How to use Ramza? Most people will put Full Break on him and then Lifesiphon if they have Tailwind for him or a relevant Breakdown if they dont. In your case Id stick Lifesiphon on him if you want to dps and you can fill the boss primary damage source with a relevant Breakdown on someone else in your main party. His SB hits for pretty good damage so you have much higher than usual damage potential with a support. In the case of using his BSB if you have someone whos SB you want to use frequently his nd command gives a bonus to the SP gauge. In my setup for example I rely pretty heavily on Dark Cecils SSB for burst damage because its the only SSB I have so using a roaming Shout and Ydas crit bonus relic help me to burst ridiculously hard with him. Ramzas BSB would feed more into that kind of strategy. But with his huge Defense boost off of his BSB you might be able to forego a regular wall and give him and something like Celes or someone else who has a Resistance  boost Mako Might and Dr. Mogs Teachings allowing you to change your setup and strategy some.Its not the best BSB but that doesnt mean its bad.

8814648,0,t1_d77bczi,definitely! and thank you! hopefully Ill be able to get either Tiduss OSB or his model when banner  comes in global!OSBs deff do fine on their own! its evident if you see people in multiplayer only having an OSB and nothing else with a boostga itll carry pretty easily no doubtJP deff seems uncomfortable due to being unable to read the language but in actuality its about the same as global in terms of medal conditions and especially the interface such as relic draws equipments and whatnot so its actually really simple to navigate even if you cant read JapaneseI cant!for some reason I feel like I have too much time on my hands..what with almost always receiving little work during college plus having nothing to do..but Im used to my rather mundane life sigh..sometimes I wish I could go back in time to  years ago..plus due to my mind replaying my past  years ago and thinking a lot as thats all I can do all while FFs main theme plays in my headeither the gbapsp one or the NES one..actually you can use two staves separately if you have a black mage that can use staves like Rinoaif dived or potentially a sage like hope or tellah and staves are technically like black mage rods but with higher mind but combining when you have a good  one is always a good thing for sure! yet its deff a good idea to look at stats and synergy before combining as well as your relicsMagic RS can definitely carry you through an event if you lack synergy although you will deff need your strongest physical weapon for non realms preferably maxed with Rosetta stonesLightnings Overture for example I dont have any physical nor armor in Tactics yet my Crystal and poison rods help greatly!actually only the poison rod for Terra Yuna could use it but it has to be a  star to surpass her  star lullaby rod sadly,FFRecordKeeper,d77efrf,1,t5_3779b

This one isnt worth the effort. I wouldnt stress if you cant do this one.Edit I did it!

Im just the poser that recently started this and powercreeped my cores to match the games powercreep. Also I picked something else so no SLG for me ever. It was around  when some battles started becoming too hard for coreonlynogacha runs. Some were still manageable but some werent. Especially with Us and Us there were very few of them that had a gimmick to exploit such as Retaliate being weak to thunder amp using SLG etc.Unfortunately it just needs to be done. Four things determine your power in this game. You either excel greatly in one or find a balance in your four. Levels Gearsynergy Soul Breaks AbilitiesStrategyCoreonlynogacha runs sought to show that you could keep up with everything with the proper abilities  strategy. However weve long since entered the age of  abilities and cores dont even have RDs to unlock them. Most cores are capped at  vs. named characters reaching  and soon to have capability. We also only got White Mages SB. No MagusBardRanger. But yeah the cap on abilities is the biggest issue aside from possibly being shotted from bosses high ATK amp MAG. I guarantee you if Dragoon could use Dragoon Jump or Thunder Dive or Knight could use Saints Cross and actually hit lv or Bard could use Full Break the tierchallenge threads would be full of coreonly parties. ,FFRecordKeeper,d81rlsw,1,t5_3779b

In addition to the character getting synergy every piece of equipment they take into the battle gets synergy as well.That is HUGE.Conversely not only will characters who lack Bravery Synergy not get their stats boosted none of the equipment they take into the battle will either.That is VERY debilitating.There are exceptions that cannot be ignored a White Mage with a great Medica etc. But seriously a character with Bravery Synergy and no SBSSB fielding a damaging multihit  ability may be worth bringing over other characters without synergy that have good SBSSBs. At least make some attempts at different parties if your strongest team cannot clear the battle since the cost for that last dungeon is only  stamina.,FFRecordKeeper,d82jp8q,2,t5_3779b

Perhaps randomize the bosses so that youre forced to smartly build a team for each day. Since theyre bosses keep it to  round per battle that drops  greatermajor orbs per round. Magic pots very rarely spawn after a boss dies and are trivial to kill dropping  majorscrystals instead of the bosss drops.A rather delightful fantasy yes.

A pull on that banner can net you Ramzas Tailwind SB which you can use as a backup medica and Ramza is a top tier support who can pump out respectable damage.

9184382,0,t3_5641sv,Banner  looks absolutely delicious.  Fang OSB  Just fine like most OSBs. It will do its job.  Lightning BSB  LightningNonElemental is great.  Hits is also great and Imperil Lightning is a very welcome addition.  Sazh BSB  I am going to guess this does not stack with Celes. Regardless this is an excellent BSB addition.  Vanille BSB  I want this so much.  However banner  really does not look appealing to me at all.  Vanille USB  Are status effects such a big issue that this holds merit?  Hope BSB  AoE Cast with more damage on less enemies? Is this not extremely counterintuitive to to the entire AoE aspect?  Noel BSB  Unless the commands are stellar just one of many Full Break BSBs?  Raines BSB  If his buff stacks with others like HotE this would be great actually. Let us hope this is not coded the same way as Rikkus HotE version which would result in not being able to stack.

Whether its more worth it to try and pull for an item itself probably. But thats subject to RNG. Your choice. Id just pull on a banner itself which would give synergy if you get a weapon there but yeah. For FF it would be a sick weapon with Cid Raines BSB RW. So its up to you.Demonsbane meh.

9213784,0,t1_d8jwj6o,Wrath gives you just slightly more SB than Lifesiphon specifically I think was  SB Points more  vs.  when attacking  getting hit is worth  with one full Bar being  Points to give a sense of scale.You wont get enough turns in to recharge another BSB without letting one of the Commands run out. Generally speaking one normally gets  Actions in during Burst Mode IIRC.In that Scenario you would go st BD Command gt nd BD Command gt Wrath and at this point you need to refresh your first Debuff as your th Action.Now your Burst Mode runs out and youre stuck with like half an SB Bar assuming Faris never gets hit during all that time. Probably wont ever actually happen but its just an example after all.By the Time you get back to a full Bar both your Commands should have run out as should the BSB Debuff itself.Long Story short Support BSBs with Breakdown Commands are not very good if any substitutes for the actual BreakdownAbilities,FFRecordKeeper,d8jwyyi,1,t5_3779b

9228395,0,t3_56ra10,Oh boy. I started the game pretty late I had known about it but I was serving my mandatory military draft in South Korea and had no access to a smartphone besides when I was on my leave and that wasnt often. When I finished my  months of service I bought a new phone and downloaded FFRK and Crusaders Quest two games I still go ham with to this very day.CQ interested me more at the beginning and I mostly only got the login bonuses and cleared classicelites every now and then on FFRK. Didnt really try to learn the game at the time. Then I found rffrk. I learned about the strats the JP future sight all the goods. I learned about the FFT banner that was to come in a few months.I had no  star abilities at all my only  star relic was a Buster Sword and Danjuro and I only cleared upto classic difficulty on events. Sometimes I tried elites but I was nowhere near the spec that was necessary for  and above. Maybe on lucky ones Id clear a difficulty. Then came the FFT bannner. I think I had somewhat around  saved up at the time. Pulled everything on the banner minus the Nu Khai still pisses me off with  myth saved. From that point on Ive managed to clear every single event. The game became so much more fun I turned my attention from CQ to FFRK. And rffrk turned me a reddit addict.I still wonder from time to time if I didnt manage to pull Platinum Sword back then would I still be playing this game? Itd have saved me blowing  bucks on Iga Blade and didnt manage to pull it to boot fucking worthless BSB but I enjoy the company of you all and the feeling of achievement and mass nostalgia when playing the game so I guess  bucks is nothing when I think of the enjoyment I get from playing the game.May RNGesus be with you all on OK Ysh and TGC banner when the time comes.,FFRecordKeeper,d8lrlw4,2,t5_3779b

Maybe I can bring an Imperil RW instead? Oh or maybe a Magic Blink Medica. More often than not gearing for elem without having a good base ATK is a waste.

9240602,0,t3_56y5oq, Our Untouchable Hero  Unlike some realms my FFVII synergy is goodtogreat. As such Galuf tops out at  ATK in this realm making the choice to leave Loner at home a little easier. In fact I tried a run with Loner and just barely ran out of steam I probably should have retried and just HampR twice or defended a couple opener attacks for more SB. This took  tries didnt bother to SL just died amp restarted.  This fight is almost exactly the same as the Ruby Dragon fight only with a different boss .  The first  actions at gamespeed  are RW Lifesiphon x RW. After that I changed the speed to  and repeated the following  times Lifesiphon Autoattack x Defend SSB.  This results in a net loss of  SB points per cycle but thanks to the lead off  SB points I could repeat this until hones wore out. Finished with Lifesiphon amp SSB.  Wish me luck for Diamond Weapon.  missed actions is going to bite.  EDIT I think Diamond is out of reach Close but not enough. I had  more hit to open the core. I defended and took a couple hits to charge SB but he acted before my .s casttime was over. Even so  Lifesiphons left with that much HP? GG.

If you have an EnFire on say Terra for example with her SSB then R Chain Firaga is definitely appealing or Lulus EnFrost SSB go with Chain Blizzaga.

Id recommend pulling as normal and seeing what falls into your lap  see if a banner has elemental stuff and other things with utility. After all never chase one relic unless youre willing to spend hundreds of dollars.An enelement allows you to concentrate damage on one character.

I honed mine to R on impulse but I dont regret getting it.Firion can get Support  and Spellblade  for Breakdowns and an Elemental profile but his big appeal is being a weapon master. With exceptions for character specifics and maybe Guns Firion can use every Physical weapon type in the game making him very easy to gear for Synergy. Hes not as flashy as some of the Knights or Spellblades but he works really well for what he is.Firions Burst has its main appeal in the entry and second command. Burst entry gives instant Magic Blink which is amazing for mitigation against scripted Magic or otherwise. Command  is  hits and Instant Cast next move essentially Power Chains effect. Command  has a high ceiling but it takes a while to build the hits that far. Its main appeal will be the D fights where Firion can build the stack against Trash.,FFRecordKeeper,d935ly5,7,t5_3779b

9441438,0,t3_5a0os0,What is this a time traveling thread?The relics dont matter that much in this case. Youre using double cut thats why your team feels weak without advantaliate. Get your character good abilities. Barrage is pointless but youll want that Saint Cross at r and Full break at least at r.You said you have characters at level  but seens like youre a new player. Im confused by that. Just focus on honing. Since I dont know which abilities you have and you said you have base spells which I understand as all the usefull  star abilities at least at r you should start working towards  star abilities.The obvious update from advantaliate is RW Shout. So just get your bestfavorites physical characters and use Shout. Youll realize what youre missing if you cant have enough abilities for everyone.PS Pull in banners that are not from FFX sometimes!

I dont know what your weapon situation looks like for synergy but for melee teams Fran can do it really easily and shes likely being brought as support anyway if you like to Cid Mission things.

9532089,0,t1_d9nq6qn,What im trying to get across is everything he does is second fiddle. His elemental range is second to any spellblader or BM due to the fact that dragoon elemental jumps are only  because they have equal cast time to ANY level spellblade and an additional . air time than SBers. Support  is useless if he doesnt have a good skill to use in that second slot. Full break only being a single hit is still a staple in every high level fight. It simply adds an additional layer of stack able mitigationdamage potential.Ill admit im a bias since I pulled his SSB but I cant think of anyone worse off minus cores. I havent gained the shooter abilities yet so cannot speak of experience of them but I can mention giving him a bow to do  more shooter damage may be offset by simply using a sword unless you got lucky and pulled a strong bow and have a sword that isnt  stronger. It keeps getting worse Sapphire shoot uses major Ice Lightning and Holy orbs. Lot of competition for those orbs. How many shooters are there?I suppose back rowing him with a bow shooter and a dragoon ability will do to some extent. ,FFRecordKeeper,d9o13fo,1,t5_3779b

9665743,0,t3_5dh9az,The atk soft cap is .  Thats   Shout or   OK BSB.  A rule of thumb is that elemental boosts are worth roughly  atkmag EDIT below soft cap  above before buffs.So if you have  atk  elemental boost  Shout thats about the same as   Shout.  But if you can augment your elemental boost weapon record sphere and level your character to raise their atk you can often get near or over the soft cap which means additional atk from synergy would not provide that much benefit.Btw because the atk soft cap is so low you rarely need to use both Shout and a stacking ATK buff like OK BSB these days if you have highish level characters and some decent modern nonsynergy weapons.  The hype for OK BSB is more as a replacement for Shout instead of something that typically goes with it since they both have haste and together provide more atk than you need.,FFRecordKeeper,da4i7bp,9,t5_3779b

9704319,0,t1_da97mf8,The reason why you want to learn a SB is so that character still has access to it without needing to be equipping its relic anymore.  So now if you go somewhere that youve got a  staff from and thats been upgraded to its max lvl of  you can equip that instead of Thyrus since the  will have better stats while its being used in its home realm and still use StoneSkin for her SB.You can combine  gear but I really dont recommend it for a long time yet. Combined gear is only like  stronger but now you only have one of them being equipped and making  guy hit hard but separate you can have two guys equipped with a  spear and two guys hitting for  as much damage that you could be having one guy hitting for with that one  is mathematically better right?  The goal is to get five  weapons and armors for every one of the realms so that everyone in you party is wearing  RS equipments.  Some may suggest more than  some like  or  weapons for mages and for fighters and again for the armors.  So its gonna be a long time before I imagine you will need to seriously think about combining  relics.  And dont thing  relics are not good enough for you especially at this point in your gameplay. Start building a collection of  meaning you got  of the same  and combined them all gear now and you will be happy with the results some day for sure.  ,FFRecordKeeper,da99kc7,2,t5_3779b

Literally poked Ifrit to death with a random Gregs counters once the healers caught on.My more DPSy setup is OKEdea for stacking Faithgas. k Swiftspells from the word go.Another Tank Setup I sometimes trot out is LeonSeifer.

A solid group of  should get you through the rest of the FF elites. but it depends on whos actually . I would spend the eggs on getting Arc and Ingus up to fluff since you have their relics. Ingus alone should be able to mitigate the Single Target attacks of bosses and mobs well enough with his BSB commands. The th level boss is vulnerable to slow and blind so I would suggest making Tempo Flurry Celerity  skill if you havent already and putting it on a character you hopefully have leveled. FF event dungeon is over in two days and I think its possible for you to at least get into the bonus battles. If you are having trouble with the bosses or mobs just let me know what characters you have leveled and what relics you have.P.S. Inguss BSB unique command  allows him to direct incoming single target attacks black magic and physical to him while also buffing his physical defense greatly. This makes it easier to predict who will need healing and takes the heat off of squishies. Ingus is quite durable and can take the hits too.,FFRecordKeeper,danuvy5,1,t5_3779b

With full dive he has nightmare synergy in all but the Summon dungeon which sadly is one of the three remaining to be released.

9837901,0,t3_5g2gh9,Tis rather disheartening to hear they are boosting the difficulty significantly. Only the past two events I have been able to clear the U and that was barely squeaking by using the RW way. For example I had to SL the current FF U for over  hours before RNG allowed me to win due to their scripted attacksAOE and heals actually helps you win the fight faster cause their attacks are killer. The fight doesnt last long because Tidus BSB allowed you to dish out x AOE with synergy weapon per turn but those four rodents were each dishing out the pain.  defenseresistance and still taking hits for up to  after wall shellga protectga and multibreak. In the end I had to use two healers and Vanille BSB instant cast aoe heal as a clutch to survive.IMO increasing difficulty past  is a mainly a relicSB check and if lacking weakness then also ability hones check.,FFRecordKeeper,dapwggp,1,t5_3779b

The  abilities summons breakdowns dismissal those are all very important more so than any  abilities. If you lack r in many of the good  abilities you should concentrate on honing those. If you whale every now and then mithril isnt as valuable so going hard is easier on orbfests. If youre fp mithril is more valuable. Personally I have everything as fp that ill ever need completing every event no cm and am only looking to focus on my mage skills for future proofing. The only skill I really need to hone this orbfest is chain firaga and maybe ill increase my Gaia cross. Everyone plays a personal game due to our relics.

Bosses used to not have break resistance.It would also hurt new players a lot full strength breaksbreakdowns are pretty good when you have very little good gear and low level characters.The real problem is that break resistance does not apply to the debuff cap so when somethings resistance you actually want more breaks because theyre more effective once you start stacking them.If I were redesigning things from the ground up Id half break effects and drop resistance but also make a lot more bosses have one or more specific break immunities and drop their stats accordingly. Id also likely implement speed break which the game engine supports but nothing can do Celerity  for Speed Break and Support  for Speed Breakdown and make sure its viablerequired in some number of fights. Combine hyper break and full break. Possibly rework stacking entirely so every effect is a bunch of individual effects combined like HyperNullAll and add DeprotectDeshellDebraveDefaith as the only sources of stacking debuffs but thats getting pretty ambitious.,FFRecordKeeper,dax932b,5,t5_3779b

10039455,0,t1_dbg3wuf,It might be I simply value OK more than you because I cant imagine not using him at this point. Hes the first character in my party for any Ateam situation. So the other situations you mention in comparison to Shout vs. Hydaelyn seem like kind of a nonfactor to me. As for Guts while I dont find it to be a high tier support ability its useful for saving SLs and MP for saving you when you take a stray hit. thats too hard or your healing it just a bit slow. I dont think its usefulness is limited to just long drawn out fights and even if it were only running a single R skill seems to be a recipe for disaster in any fight.Im not sure the free Powerchain that is his first command is really that replaceable but even if it was OK is flexible enough that it doesnt matter. Recently Ive been running him with Vincents Shortbarrel Chain Blizzaga and Full Break and he can do pretty much anything. If theres a weakness he can switch his spell and between the  MAG boost and weaknesss. I guess I just dont find the claim that hes easily replaceable to be convincing based on my experience especially since hes bringing the ultra utility BSB with him.,FFRecordKeeper,dbg614p,1,t5_3779b

LolAlso I cant speak on good ideas for the lexicon but I can tell you that if your Galuf has his HP intact before he goes Indomitable then you wont have the problem of him drawing on your auto cures cast untargetted will it?  There is the solution to this problem so what I recommend trying is that if no one is about to die off when his SB is filled then how about casting a cure at him right after he begins to cast his SSB so he will get hit with one last cure to top off any damage he has or that he might take while trying to use it so that way he wont be a problem afterwards ,FFRecordKeeper,dbgi7h7,1,t5_3779b

I used  MC on Riona Squall Maria and now Krile. I have no relics for them minus riona  st SB and SSB still bad tho but those stat boosts I feel are significant in letting me complete ifrit and their CMs. My ATeam will barely notice a  roughly stat boost so its not as much of a concern to me to squeeze every bit of power out and the RMs are nice but only ever so slightly better than ones I have now. Trust me. You WILL notice a difference in  stats and  HP for realms you dont have RS tho. Its defiantly the biggest bang for the buck and eventually you will have enough to get your Ateam too! Ive used a few on BSB users as well in Pcecil Beatrix Tyro.     TLDR Dont go for the RMs after luneth.

That said its rather easy to reach their soft cap with even a nonRS mage throwndagger at .Tanks get some value out of HP resdef scales poorly and theyre usually pretty good there at  already.Tyro can make good use of every stat due to his natural low scores and is a very tanky singletarget healer at .,FFRecordKeeper,dbk3dbj,3,t5_3779b

10106461,0,t3_5klqec,You have a ton of flexibility but youre not trying to play by the games rules. First bosses need to have their main attack stat broken as much as possible. Faris can do it with her BSB Zidane can do physical with his BSB and Ramza can do a fine job with . Whatever the case you need to break the stat AND apply a Full Break.Second you need a real healer. Rosa is your only viable so shes the one. No amount of mitigation makes up for the ability to cast five  HP heals at once. With the way bosses pierce defense this is totally necessary. Third just skimming your post and loadout you have a ton of missed opportunities. Zidane Fang Faris and Rosa would make an excellent foundation for tackling Ults and you have them benched! Similarly Cloud is just providing damage and no utility. Unless hes geared to the hilt with wind weapons and armor I dont think he should be a full timer.Fourth you should not be using a RW Shout if you have it natively. Either bench Ramza for Faris or find something else to RW like wall. I dont think Tyro needs to be a permanent fixture in the party but I dont have any good SBs for him.Fifth unless you have the same exact gear and abilities as someone else advice is always use at your own risk including everything Ive just said. You need to analyze the toys you have and see how they fit together. Beyond Haste Protectga Shellga and Breakdowns the requirements of a party are very loose. I cleared a ton of content with only Curamedica weak AOE SSBs and RW Shout. I clear all the content now with native Shout and RW Wall and weaker damage options than you.,FFRecordKeeper,dbovt8w,4,t5_3779b

I think it makes a difference.Edit My bad I saw you answered that already.I got SG pretty late up to about  months ago I think randomly in the Support lucky banner and I was always chasing it on any banner it poped up before that. Needless to say I was very excited. I also greatly value the wall on Tyro I just got SSII in OFest  and was like meh. Tyro never leaves my Ateam its the versatility he brings that is hard to replace besides the fact of wall which until then I was always RWing and made options very limiting.I find its a very weird game. With wall theres nothing deals damage enough to almost even warrant a healer luckily Vanilles BSB allows me to do damage if I dont need to heal.

You can slot BattleforgedAce Striker and use Lifesiphon to have her burst ready to go in  turns freeing up the use of DMT and MM for other people.  Alternatively you can slot her with a dmg RM and just Lifesiphon for  turns depending on incoming damage or usage of other abilities and shell pump out even more dps.  Obviously not as useful when a holy vuln is the target but it makes her more than serviceable if you dont have an imperil.,FFRecordKeeper,dbv71p6,2,t5_3779b

10163263,0,t3_5ligll,Your most optimal situation is to have Tyro on support duty as was already mentioned. However there are a lot of SBs that have mitigation effects tied to them. For example I have Ramzas burst which gives a huge defense boost. So theoretically I could just Ramza BSB using Mako or Mogs Teachings and bring something like Garnets hastega SSB as a roaming warrior and I will have a ton of bonus resistances that opens up Asylum usage. You could also just RW a wall if you have haste and boostfaith coverage for your team too.Wall isnt mandatory these days there are a ton of different ways to bring mitigation to your team. It just depends on what other SBs and mitigation options you have and smart RW usage.

Yes it sucks that not everyone can afford gems but its not like players whod buy a pull here and there would really help the game financially. Dont get me wrong Id definitely pay for pulls if gems were cheaper but its important to understand that couple of CP players buying a couple cheaper pulls will never be as great for DeNA as whales spending a lot of money on  pulls. At the end of the day DeNA is a company and they want to make a profit. ,FFRecordKeeper,dc2u65j,1,t5_3779b

10239854,0,t3_5mmvwa,In the majority of situations Id recommend Dark Zone over Morbid Countdown. Heres the difference going by the spreadsheet        Dark Zone    Dark magic . potency if not doomed potency . if doomed  hits    Morbid Countdown    Dark magic . potency if not doomed potency . if doomed  hits    Added effect reduces doom timer by  seconds  So although Morbid Countdown is a higher potency attack in most cases thats not going to be a reason to pick it over Dark Zone. The reason for this is that youre going to be capping anyway which means the added potency is wasted and therefore youre just accelerating your doom timer needlessly. Id still hang onto it unless you are sorely in need of the orbs since its something that would be handy to have for a second darkness user.Edit Formatting,FFRecordKeeper,dc4qtg0,7,t5_3779b

Youll take a hit in your attack power but its a good sacrifice.Next I would try to slot in another Lightning user. You want to get through Omnegator as quickly as possible since he gets stronger the longer its up.With the Instant Ko accessories he doesnt get hard until after his last barrier is broken. Once it is down you will need to burst him down. It would be better to do this with Imperils or strong Lightning abilitiesSBs. I believe after the last barrier is broken his Gravity attacks become NAT which means Instant KO resists are nullified. Not sure what AoE heals you have on Aerith but try to save them for this phase.

10334235,0,t1_dcfczzb,Fest banners like the nd anniversary ones are always different from JPs list so dont always expect a desired relic to appear.  We usually dont get the global information until were closer to its launch date when dataminers can pick up the info for us.If the next DU Lucky Draw is curated to SSB you might just be able to get one of the relic types I suggested.  At the very least see what you get from there before deciding on FFT.  While getting Orlandeaus SBs would be great the main reason I suggested FFT was for a good chance at getting an Auxiliary Layer mitigation debuff Agriass Cleasing Strike ATKMAG or a better medica Ovelias Magic Blink Medica. which are among the more common drops.  Theres some recent bosses who either pierce through your defensive stats or mess with your defensive buffs so being able to put stackable debuffs that they cant remove can keep you safe while you recover.   Your medica Yunas has been eclipsed at this point so youll probably want something stronger for harder fights.  Of course you can fulfill these needs on other potential banners but FFT is one I was able to quickly recognize the potential to try to get both among other benefits.,FFRecordKeeper,dcffyrw,1,t5_3779b

Then instead of Kuja BSB just use second RW cast and then  cmd should be enough.

Thats  magic buff you are losing if you miss that which will not apply to the BSB if you do it too late. Meanwhile you get instant cast BSB with command  method.  Also thats . more DPS on the Tiamat thing. While you get  more SB gauge with command  spam. Like really there is a clear choice.

10436943,0,t1_dcn694f,...right ok.please dont attempt to correct other people when you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.for one thing zyosi  while using the characters for woman  and child  is as applicable to adult women as any of the other myriad except onnanohito which i grant i completely overlooked options presented in this thread.  there are even several kanzi compounds containing zyosi which are moreorless strictly applicable to adult females in any given context and many others which are ageagnostic zyosiryoku being one of them really...and zyosikai while being rare enough that ive never heard it in practice actually has a japanese wikipaedia entry that squares it in the same ageneutral category.  so thats one point of error.for another thing zyosei is the proper nippon and kunreisiki romanisation absent macron vowel elongation because macron superposition is quite difficult to do without copying and pasting or memorising arcane unicode formulae for what the hepburn formulation would present as josei again with moraic vowel elongation for simplicitys sake.kunreisiki is in fact both the officially prescribed romanisation convention and the academically preferred one being as it seriously reduces linguistic ambiguity in romanisation that arises as a result of historically incidental phonemic shifts !  i actually prefer nipponsiki even to kunreisiki as i like to mind my dus  and zus  but in either case the romanisation in question zyosei is not distinguishable between the two.i understand that many students whose mother tongue is english are taught japanese using the hepburn system and i have absolutely no problem recognising and accepting it as perfectly valid myself but its utterly preposterous for you to purport to correct someone who is using the system of romanisation  prescribed by the japanese government and  most widely used by academicians.  so thats a second point of error.i find it rather disconcerting that your flair is given in japanese when you clearly have a passing at best acquaintance with the language and its conventions.  if youll permit me a bit of undue  and admittedly rude  presumptuousness people like you are the reason that people like me are called weebs when i dont even watch any anime or read any manga.,FFRecordKeeper,dcr3ka2,1,t5_3779b

10438925,0,t3_5phggt,I think it comes down to what do you want. I have the most satisfaction clearing a Cid mission or playing with my favorite realm. I try to clear all content using only my favorite realm first. Then Cid mission. Then if anything is left make up an ateam. If by that time I cant clear it I do a pull. Lucky draws are generally pretty good at keeping your synergy up. If you want to just blow stuff away by all means plan your pulls for the best stuff. I have less fun when its super easy personally. I skipped Raines ff and will also skip tactics again.  Havent had an issue clearing the Cid missions with old stuff or no ssb stuff.The point Im trying to make is that its all well and good to follow the crowd and get the best stuff but I never chased any relic other than Relms bsb and have both walls and both shouts for example. Maybe its just very lucky but I dont think it is. Its just patience because eventually the best relics become easier to get and there are actually a ton of great relics right now.

10457152,0,t1_dcsh7d2,Orlandus will still be better but the difference isnt huge. According to my calculations LSxgtOrlandu OSBx is about  more DPS than LSxgtBSBgtOSBgtOSB and the comparison is generally more favorable to Orlandu in shorter sequences.Though note that Pencil should benefit more from WrathgtEntrust not a fan of the strategy myself but if you use it it may be factor for you. I havent mathed it out but Cecils SB generation rate is much lower than Orlandus after entering T.G. mode so an Entruster would increase his SB generation rate proportionately more and therefore his DPS as well. Also Pencils USB grants enHoly while dealing higher entry damage as well as providing a huge  HP shield. Of course using a BSB means Pencils combo will be more useful in fights that go long enough for you to run out of ability uses but I dont think thats really a problem for an OSBspamming Orlandu.,FFRecordKeeper,dctf8i7,1,t5_3779b

Even the D FFV Torment didnt feel as tough as this one due to Indomitable Blade cheesing the dungeon.. Strategy name  Burst Mode!. Boss  D The Ravenous Deep. Insight!  I used HnR until I had a YAT or Dual Horn spawn on floor . I then blinded it with Blindga on Yuffie. Blindga helped with the second spawn of YAT as well.  I used Tauntaliate through Ingus Burst to get through the trash. With Ramzas Shout it helped to get through the trash quicker. I also used Yuffies and Vaans Bursts to help get through the  floors whenever I felt it was needed making sure to be able to Burst once I hit Geosgaeno. Aetherial Pulse on Ysh helped with any AOEs flung at me.  Before entering Geosgaenos floor I refreshed Aetherial Pulse Stoneskin  and Shout.  All KO Resist accessories to deal with Regurgitate Tauntaliate to deal with Punch and Stone Punch and Ysh Asylum Burst for Tsunami  Gush.  In the weak phase Medica spamming was important to keep up with his AOEs. Even through ProShellga Mug Bloodlust MagicPower Breakdown Full Break and Wall he was hitting almost k on my team.

10486870,0,t3_5q454h,If you switch to having one sticky index maybe flaired as MEGATHREAD Index and one questions thread I have some suggestions. I agree that having a ton of megathreads rapidly rotating in and out of the sticky slot makes them harder to see and less likely to be used.For the index thread give it a title likeMEGATHREAD Index GL FF X DU  Nightmare Torment JP FF IX DU  Abyss Nightmare Share your strategies stories and relic pulls!Make the index thread locked so no comments are allowed. This is important so that you can delete the thread at will. Whenever game content is added or removed  or  times a week copy the old thread into a new one with an updated title and link list then just delete the old index thread since it has no comments in it.By doing this you can simulate a single permanently stickied thread where the title can be periodically changed. Describing all the current content in the thread title will be important advertising to draw people in  if you just title it Index then folks wont think of that thread first. Keeping that listing in the title fresh will make it more appealing. Thats why Im guessing it might be nice to have a special MEGATHREAD Index flair just for the index thread to separate the index part so the actual title can begin with the list of content.I like that the index thread makes it easier for you to keep the questions thread visible most of the time. I suspect that when the questions thread isnt stickied more people make new threads for tiny questions.I wonder if you could make the questions thread more attractive by encouraging toplevel posters to use a heading style to give their question a title so each question feels more like a separate post. You might include instructions like thisPlease make your questions stand out by giving them a title! Use a short first paragraph that begins with  then put the details in subsequent paragraphs. For example    How should I set up Raines with his BSB?        I just got Raines BSB and Id appreciate some advice on .....        I think I can use him better than I have been.

10620578,0,t1_ddbeemc,The math for this is extremely complicated.  Keeping it simple for me I am just going to look at DPS purely on Zidane alone. So no teammates exploiting an earlier Imperil Wind nor factoring BSBs CMD party boosting. Also because the stacking  ATK buffs on his BSB are troublesome to calculate and probably doesnt matter too much in practice I will just look at DPS from these  options Imperil gt Mug Power gt Enwind Imperil gt Enwind Enwind gt Imperil Enwind gt EnwindTaking a  damage boost from  ATK from Burst and b  damage boost from  ATK from Burst  Mug Power and just purely looking at multipliersFor st option BSB . in .s  Mug Power   a in .s  BSB .  .  b in .s  .  a  .b in .s.For nd option BSB . in .s  BSB .  .  a in .s  .  .a in s.For rd option BSB . in .s  BSB .  .  a in .s  .  .a in s.For th option BSB . in .s  BSB .  .  a in .s  .  .a in s.Its very complicated to make sense of the numbers and probably not worth the time to proceed further since in practice theres damage cap team buffs ATK softcap BSB utility what do you want to do after all these BSB casts etc. Cant ignore the things I left out in para  either in practice.So it boils down to which set of BSB commands you want to use and you use it last. Ill probably use option  most of the time  BSB first for utility muggings before using BSB for damage.

10623059,0,t1_ddbnohd,I agree to an extent in that characters like lulu can be tough to fit in since they arent versatile and so for example if you want protshellga in a team you may need a paladin as well as a white mage. However as you say about tyro others can pick up the slack while still doing another job.Stacking mitigation is key to success in this game which is why hyper break is so valuable. Currently  characters have it only  of which has  support. If you have irvines SB great but if not then it definitely an option to run  supports to cover the  stacks to increase your longevity. If your other support was someone like Ramza then if you have the SBs you can keep up shout tailwind etc by running lifesiphonfull break. Tyro has lots of options to run alongside FB dps or support. If you can throw in an atkmag SB on someone like Faris stacked with hyper break full break mag breakdown along with shellwall youll take no damage from U bosses. It just depends on what relics you have on other characters in your team.Having too many dps units isnt optimal most of the time  you need some characters using their SB gauge to keep up buffs etc. OK and Raines have the best mage team buffs at the moment since they can simultaneously act as a dps and are a different kettle of fish. If you have Raines BSB then he can handle most of your dps and it makes  supports viable with mages. Without that its definitely better as a physical team.,FFRecordKeeper,ddborol,2,t5_3779b

10685954,0,t1_ddi4q2y,When you understand how the status ID system works it makes sense.Status effects can only have a single parameter attached to them.  For stat modifiers this is the potency of the effect.  For ATK mods for instance that parameter might be      etc.  This is why Power Break Shout Rallying Etude etc. all overwrite each other they can just reuse this effect and have a different potency attached.However this means that using standard status IDs effects cannot modify multiple stats in different ways.  Theres no way for the standard ATKDEF mod to modify the two stats differently at the same time.  Its either all positive or all negative and it has to be the same number.Thus any effects that modify multiple stats but at different values have to be their own unique ID with fixed values which is only reused by something that grants the exact same values.  So Hand of the Emperor ATKDEF  isnt the same as Dark Bargain ATK DEF  isnt the same as Advance ATK DEF .Similarly a source of standard MAGRES  is a different effect from Focus as Focus is a fixed MAG RES .  Even though in this case both values are positive theres no way for the system to modify two stats at different values in a single standard effect since Focus does exact that it needs its own ID.When you grasp that logic the number of weird exceptions drops down to almost zero Hi Hopesworn Espada,FFRecordKeeper,ddi6cg4,7,t5_3779b

10687096,0,t1_ddhjwjp,I think youd be surprised how effective Moderate is for status resistances.Using no resistance is resistance value .Minor resist reduces the chance it will land by  denoted by resistance value .Moderate resist reduces the chance it will land by  denoted by resistance value .Major resist reduces the chance it will land by  denoted by resistance value .Add  to the resistance value if the accessory has synergy and only for accessories. Armor does not benefit from synergy when talking about statuselemental resistances.So when you look at the AI threads that TFMurphy does and you see those  chance to land gravity type attacks you take that and reduce it by the resist. this means you only have a  chance to get hit by the status if it is Moderate resist. Less chance to get hit if the accessory has synergy and even less if you stack it with an armor that has Minor KO resist.Unlike Elemental resistances which only uses the higher value status resistances will stack together to further reduce the chances of it landing.Just know that you can never reduce the chance of a status landing below  no matter how much status resistance you stack.The formula is  times chance of status to land divided by resistance value  final chance for status to land.In the case of gravity type attacks its usually  hit chance. But for this torment dungeon the chance to land is only . TFMurphy puts the final chance for a status to land in his AI threads. Taken from AI thread ltFiragt NAT  chance of  MaxHP Dmg resisted via Death. So if the final chance with no resistances is  we can reverse engineer that to find the actual hit chance. x Solving for x we get  since Now in this case if you were using a moderate resist accessory with no synergy the formula would be  .. So you only have a  chance that this gravity based attack will land with a moderate resist accessory equipped.,FFRecordKeeper,ddialn8,6,t5_3779b

10787969,0,t3_5ub3xf,As a longtime player but a minnow I have avoided combining five star equipment. For  a long time I had three Celescaliburs and two Garnet Wizard Rods I had kept separate. However I recently finally decided to combine them after acquiring enough  star and reforged  star FF swords and FF rods to make keeping the extra copies as stat sticks unnecessary.  The result has been creating my strongest melee weapon which has  ATT wo synergy and a whopping  with reforged and fully augmented and one of my strongest mage weapons.  They are nice to have but not game changers.  Id say whether its worth combining depends on whether you can use separate copies as stat sticks or not.,FFRecordKeeper,ddsp9kd,5,t5_3779b

10891574,0,t3_5v3ubd,Team!I was beating my head against him with Basch over Beatrix because I just had no leeway against anything. I had brought Basch because I figured Apocalypse Shield was a good way to guarantee enough damage in P. Turns out I could get things together enough while also not taking enough damage myself.I swapped out Basch for Beatrix and it made all the difference. Being able to use her SSB to help with damage was huge. Took some pressure off Vanille.Phase  I used Vanilles first turn to haste Zell and then Zell popped Meteor Crush into Lifesiphon while Cid just used LS Beatrix LS spammed and Gilgamesh used Mirror into LS.The orbs spawned red top and green bottom so with Zell on top I just waited for the phase change to use his BSB and if I dont kill the bottom orb just eat the heal. If Im lucky I get the top orb dead and come out ahead in damage.TGC mostly used Lifesiphon and his OSB which still did a respectable k resisted depending on the phase he was in.Gilgamesh was there because he had my best physical nonelemental BSB.Once I got past phase  I had a Duelist Thunder God Seiken Shock and Morphing Time waiting for him. Phase  did not last long.So if you have a spammable Magic Blink bring it. This fight is amazingly simple with it.

11038327,0,t3_5xlj12,I pulled Zell on the Combat lucky and hes become my most powerful character and the leader of my Ateam. I brought him when I solod D Bahamut and he held his own nicely.As others have said youre not conceptualizing Zell correctly. Its not about raw bignumbers damage output. Its about DPS spam and his party  critical buff.What you arent taking into account when looking at the numbers and no one else has mentioned is that whenever a party member gets a critical thanks to Zells BSB you can fairly chalk that up as Zells extra damage. Plus Zells CMD is instacast so in the equivalent of one other characters turn hes doing eight attacks. Plus factor in all the extra damage your other characters are doing thanks to Crit.To get the most out of Zell be sure to pair him with other multihit characters and abilities so they nab the most crit chances. You absolutely want somebody doing Thiefs Raid and somebody doing Full Charge preferably with some sort of instacast while Zells Crit is up especially if youre already stacking ATK buffs.,FFRecordKeeper,dej6b6j,1,t5_3779b

11040199,0,t1_dejcvdr, what he said.In the long run hones and skills are just as if not more important than just SBs. Youre running fine with the old RetaMeta trick. But youll find that its going to stop being as useful as it once were. And strong damage bsbs or osbs alone wont get you through everything.Going through your profile your gear as you said lack in . Understandable for a beginner. But you lucked out with Zells bsb one of the many coveted bsbs in the game. With your current gear i suggest you start combining and making  gear.  While it is advisable to save for the anniversary bannerIf you can spare an  pull you could start at one of the tyro banners and try your luck at getting Sentinels Grimoire or shout  of the most important sbs to this day. And since youre new any of the other relics will do you wonders if you draw them. Banner  has quite some outdated gear but there are some good stuff in the selection that you can use like yunas rod or ramzas tailwind for medica. or you could go for one of any of the current banners and build up on some good dps. You started at a good time as G ensures youll get   at any  pull.Aim for any of the holy trinity HastegaMedicaWallNext try to build up your team with a good format.A basic team is usually composed of  dps attackers support and medica.Youre lacking on the support department and quite a lot of hones on some skills. Try investing on a good support character instead of having tifa use armor break and build up on your skill use and upgrade when you feel you can.Do build up on this while youre still using the reta meta so when you feel you cant use this to win you can try a new strategy.,FFRecordKeeper,dejdy41,1,t5_3779b

Official ball has  attack. These weapons frequently fall behind fully upgraded  items w rosetta stones. For older players they would work as  rosetta stones or if someone did roll on these items in the past they could atleast combine them.One event a week  weeks in a year to roll out the first realm specific soul break per event.Hell if they want to gate them either further.

ProShellga up ASAP but things were survivable without Wall. I spammed Firion and Minwus CMD  to do most of the damage. Minwu occasionally had to use CMD  to heal but the hit AoE was great for bomb rounds. Guy spammed LS til he got to  bars and then he Leon and Gordon punched things for SB gauge. Refreshed ProShellga on Round  Leon used HotE and RWd Wall  as close to the end of it as possible.Boss Firion used his Burst ASAP to null that first thunderbolt. Guy and Gordon really pulled through in this fight which is why I named my strategy the way I did. Guys first drum did .k per hit I believe but he was hitting for upper ks with subsequent usesk and then k per cast when it hit all three about the same as what my Firion was hitting with BSB albeit not instant cast! Gordons Goddess Bell let him be a pseudodancer with that amazing ATKMAG debuff. Thanks to this I didnt have to run any breakdowns. In fact I dont think I really needed Full Break. Between ProShellga Wall HotE and Goddess Bell every attack they did never broke  hp or so. Major Regen did most of the healing!Like everyone else I went Lightning gt Fire gt Ice. Leon spammed Biora and then Blizzaga purely for SB gain. I think he was hitting for  lol That said it was worth it to constantly keep HotE up! Guy used Fires Within only when the Ice Gigas was alone. I was tempted to use Minwus CMD for extra damagemitigation but apparently theres a glitch that makes it get countered three times in a row! RWd Wall  when Fire Gigas was at half health.HindsightFirion probably would have been better off replacing LS with Mirror of Equity or Armor Break to improve his DPS. Leon was nearly useless damagewise since I wanted to Master and CM at the same time. Things could be significantly faster if I ignored medal conditions! The instant cast on Minwus CMD  made me feel very safe instant casting constantly made it so that he was pretty much never out of Burst mode. Like Leon if I didnt care about Mastery I would have switched Fires with Meteor Crush. Gordons Full Break didnt do anything super noticeable he probably would have been better off just spamming Wrath for more Goddess Bells. Alternatively he could have brought a Medal Condition Black Magic so that I could make the aforementioned changed to either Guy or Leon.I was so conditioned to think that there were weak phases that I held back on AoE. If I were to do it again I would have been more liberal with my SB usesprobably could have finished quite a bit earlier!,FFRecordKeeper,denp4rk,1,t5_3779b

Defender may not be exciting to older players but it is still an aoe ssb on a character that can run spellbladelifesiphonprotectgashellga.  Same for punisher the boost in damage you get from running the ssb is significant over default sb and with orbfest you should be able to make a reasonable compliment of black magic for tagging weaknesses.

11177023,0,t3_5yj76r,What are the thoughts on rerolling accounts? With power creep and the newer relics it seems that older accounts players who have played for a year or more are underpowered compared to the newer accounts. In the harder dungeons ability hones and levels really dont matter nearly as much as equipment  especially with newer relics of BSBs and OBS and the stronger SSBs.  With a new account you have access to around  mythril and given the strength of new relics these all surpass any relics that longterm users have gotten. As an older player you dont have nearly the same access to Mythril only receiving maybe  mythril per month and doing one x pull per banner is almost guaranteed to give you minimal results. For example when you get  or  x star relics on a pull all of the remaining equipment is trash for older accounts. And the  or  you get need to be basically BSB with its  draw rate or better to make a difference for your team in the torment dungeons. Currently I have  Ultra Vanille  OSB Jecht and Rinoa  BSBs with maybe  being difference makers  Onion Knight Aleph Pecil Luneth.  Daily draws are a complete waste. If there was a bonus for increasing relic rarity for the number of consecutive daily draws you did that might make it useful.  Im leaning towards just reseting and being able to draw all of the nd anniversary relics plus having access to a substantial supply of mythril for updated banners. You have full access to the nightmare dungeons and with RWs can clear out all the dailies for ability hones.  What are the reasons to keep an older account? Im a daily player and all I do now is save up mythril for strong banners only to get junk out of it. This game seems to have transitioned to be more about what equipment on consequently how much money you spend instead of building characters and farming for ability hones.  Anyone have suggestions on how to keep up with the game without having the mythril income and keep this free to play? I have spent money on this game maybe  or more but the drop rates for good relics after spending  is so atrociously low that I will never spend a dollar on this game again. Why spend  for a single x pull when every item you get either goes straight into the trash is a dupe or is one of the consolation prizes on the banner?  Sorry for the long post but its getting harder to stay engaged in this game. I feel like Im stuck and cant improve except for hoping for better equipment. And all of my time spent in this game has taught me that you cannot rely on the relic draws. On every A banner I usually just skip down to the th or th relics to see what I might actually be drawing.,FFRecordKeeper,deywimm,0,t5_3779b

Ultima is a really nice luxury to have since its hits beats every known AOE BLK ability BSB command or otherwise in terms of damage potential even in JP.The  ability buffs should have been revealed in JP by the next FF event where we will have the last source of farmable black crystals for the next  months and counting. That is I think the best time to decide if more black crystals are worth it for me.Also worth noting that future dailies will have comparable orb rates to the current orbfest and Torment dungeons D in  months farmable in as short as  mins blow both dailies and orbfest out of the water with its orb yields. So imo the main draw of orbfest is really to level your chars.,FFRecordKeeper,df0gopm,1,t5_3779b

Kain Zell Refia BSBs I already own   By the way for damage and utility I prefer Zell out of the three.  With party critical boost if you include that in the equation Zells BSB is probably the best.  There have been too many Lightning resistant bosses lately so I find I dont have a good chance to use Kain often enough.  His BSB entry is LiNE but his cmds are just Lightning element which can be annoying when the boss is resistant to that element or absorbs it.Another healing BSB or two will be great if I want to try the radiant shield strategy on crazy DPS bosses like nemesis.

Use KO resist accessories to neuter Gis attacks and the Soulfires after they possess. You have too many healers. Debuff Gi and the damage will be negligible. You are lacking party buffs. Exdeath isnt going to do good damage nor is Fang without some sort of buff. Either swap in some sort of MAG buff or drop Exdeath in favor of Ramza.

11291202,0,t3_5zuqnl,Pulled Gabranths Enrage SB on the Always Lucky banner but cannot figure out the best way to use it.  I see three options none of which seem optimal.. Death Throes to afflict Doom and boose Attack Reaping Scythe to boost SB gauge and then Enrage.  Using Enrage after all those Darkness abilities means missing out on the enDark status not to mention its a slower way to build SB.. Lifesiphon to build gauge Enrage and then Reaping Scythe while under enDark.  Shout can give the same ATK boost as Death Throes but I lose the Doom damage bonus.. Use Mako Might to start with full gauge either Enrage or Death Throse first and then the other and then Reaping Scythe.  Aside from losing out on a damage boosting RM this optimizes Dark damage.  But it means I would have to achieve boostgafaithga hastega andor wall using DMT and RW and likely means I cannot RW another SB like having a mage RW Raines BSB which might do more Dark dps.I dont have any other Gabranth SBs.  Is there perhaps a fourth way Im missing?,FFRecordKeeper,dfbuavs,1,t5_3779b
11294169,0,t3_616kh9,I believe they do great good balance for FP while Whale can maximize their hone and  perhaps  in future. The difficulty is rising but new player can beat them in  months for now far easier than during the test of hone Boss Rush during the beginning. Now we can to wait for BOSB or BUSB as the natural powercreep.They have make created ability school and also some mechanic chain? number of hit? number of ability used? etc that I hope get further improved like how imperil has been boosted a little to compete with EnElement.I hope they learn one thing from AlimGumi with FFBE. While they also cant use some Japanese colaboration in the place they give few exclusive global collaborationeventunit aka relic.

I tried the ifrit mote dungeon once which was ???.  IIRC I proceeded to get mauled by a .k fire aoed with wall and shell up and ifrit full breaked and maybe magic breaked too. I got the hell out of there haha. This sub said it was approximately  I think.Its hard to imagine what you need to survive that. Probably triple break ifrit and have a team of fully moted synergy chars with decked out synergy gear. Then get rewarded with motes that are useless since you needed to be moted haaard to do it in the first place. p I guess there are so many characters youll need the motes for others though.Anyways I think Ill grab Thiefs Revenge since you made a strong argument. It does look pretty overloaded too.. a possible  attacks with a heal tacked on. I expected the attacks to be a bit weaker since that sounds ridiculous on paper.Also not sure why I brought up Arise as a choice just took a look at it and its not even viable if you want to champion anything at all really.Well thanks again and maybe see you on the raid battlefield someday when I catch up to you somewhat in like a year haha.

Normally I exclude Wall in particular as a RW choice but sometimes I go a little extreme and do challenges with additional stipulations.  These threads should give hope to those who werent so lucky with their relic draws.General Difficulty CMstyle Difficulty This is the one of the easiest U battles so far.  His only ability thats even slightly problematic is Northern Cross however if you use Affliction Break then you shouldnt have much trouble.II.  General Tips Affliction Break will help deal with Northern Cross the AoE Stop ability. Dont bother dispelling his Haste.  While it will make a noticeable difference in speed this boss is pretty weak for it to matter much. Bring Iceresist accessories on your attackers bring Stopresist on your healer.III.  Dullahans AbilitiesTFMurphys thread provides the specific and raw details.Northern Cross AoE Stop.  This is his only slightly problematic ability but Affliction Break  Stop resist can easily deal with this.Ultimate Morning Star AoE NAT physical damage.  This can potentially hurt your front row party members otherwise its not too noteworthy.Ultimate Absolute Zero AoE Ice magic damage the Ultimate version ignores RES.  Iceresist accessories make these abilities not much of a threat.Holy  The damage on this is ability ridiculously low.  As long as you have Shellga you shouldnt need to worry about Mind Breakdown.Curaja  Like all Curetype abilities on bosses its a complete waste of a turn.  Giving him Regen wouldve been more of a problem but luckily thats not the case.There are no other abilities worth mentioning.IV.

The StrategyCeles would start off with Protectga and then spam Saint Cross for the rest of the battle.Note  Celes unlocked access to  White Magic via Record Dive.Terra would start off the battle casting the RW use Magic Breakdown then spam Command .  When Burst Mode faded she would use Magic Breakdown once more.  If no one else summoned the RW she would summon it.  Otherwise she would spam Chain Firaga for the rest of the battle.Setzer would alternate between Full Break and Affliction Break.Mog would start off with Shellga then spam Curaja.  All characters aside from Setzer and Locke were the lowest healing priorities Setzer wasnt worth keeping alive after the second Affliction Break and Locke could self heal if he wasnt Stopped.Locke started off with Mug Bloodlust and refreshed it around Dullahans  HP mark.  Otherwise he would spam Thiefs Revenge.Other notes  If Terra didnt summon the second RW anyone other than Celes would take that role with Setzer being the most likely and Locke being the second most likely.VI.  SL FailuresNoneVII.  Ending NotesThe first thing some people might notice about the party is Celes has an  augmented sword.  This was not necessary for victory using Blazing Twinstrike for double damage over Saint Cross should allow you to hit the damage cap or very close to it.Overall this is an extremely easy U boss I doubt many will have trouble with it.  This is partially good news because it will allow people to focus on the more important Orbfest and Nemesis events.The native Trinity is never necessary.,FFRecordKeeper,dfinf1c,0,t5_3779b

11352622,0,t1_dfiqep8,Ok Ive checked through your profile and it seems like you definitely should go with a physical team.The notable things you have Yshtola BSB. Arguably one of the top two healers. Ramza Shout. High tier hastega and ATK boost for your team Cecil BSB. Not the best damage dealer but BSBs are always handy Lightning OSB. Good source of damage Mog SSB. Lowers enemy Def and Atk by a good amount. The Def lowering part will help your damage dealers do more damage. Terra OSB. Good source of damage. You dont have any Mag buffs whatsoever so Id just bench her for the time being.The team Id currently use would therefore be Yshtola Ramza Cecil Mog Lightning.Terra doesnt have any Mag boosts so youre better off not using her for now. Yshtola and Ramza will probably be the cores of your team for quite a while and the rest will probably get swapped outmb not lightning if you can manage to get better relics in the anniversary. Youre currently lacking Wallwhich probably wont be obtainable for a while and reliable damage dealers.The two current anniversary banners which hold the highest rewards for you are either anniversary banner  or . I do not recommend drawing on either banner  or . The relics on banner  are not that good. The relics on banner  are more for if youre missing a good healer one which you already have.Banner  has Cid raines BSB the current best magical damage dealer. Is even handy in physical teams since hes selfsufficient and can boost his own mage twicefyi if youre equipped correctly you only need  mag boosts to reach the cap so he effectively almost reaches it himself Golbez BSB another selfsufficient dark mage. The tankiest dark mage and can heal through his BSB. Also buffs himself once. Bartz OSB a multielemental physical OSB which is very versatile since you can use him to abuse a variety of weaknesses. Refia BSB top tier physical damage dealer. Relm BSB decent healer gives the Last Stand buff which allows your characters to survive with  hp once. Recommended for the Nemesis battle but you shouldnt worry about that since youre lacking in resources to tackle that anyway. Consider this BSB a bonus your Ysh is better. Krile SSB. Effectively the mag version of your shout. Pretty reliable since it also gives hastega.Note that atk buffs are called boostga and mag buffs are called faithgaBanner  has Agrias OSB. Standard holynormal elemental OSB. Reliable damage Agrias BSB. Will fit very well into your comp since it does imperil holy which increases holy damage on the enemy. Your Ramza and cecil are holy damage dealers so thats nice.though ramza needs his bsb for that Orlandeau OSB. The  physical damage dealer in GL right now. Everyone wants this relic. It has a holylightning property and this OSB has the highest damage multiplier out of any OSB and to top it off it gives the user a buff which decreases your cast delay by a lot making you perform more actions and effectively allowing you to charge your SB faster for more damage. Eiko BSB. The best physicaloriented healer BSB since it gives your team a  crit chance buff. Alphinaud BSB. Toptier wind mage BSB. Yuna BSB. Ok healer BSB. No redeeming qualities since you already have Ysh. Ramza SSBChant. Gives your team stoneskin max health shield and  critical damage. Pretty nice maybe you can alternate it with Shout. Alphinaud SSB. Gives your party  faithga and boostga and Radiant Shielda buff that reflects equal damage back to the enemy note that you still take dmg.Banner  is a little more mage oriented. Almost all relics on banner  are very useful so if youre short on mythril just focus on this banner. It has very good returns.Ive noticed that you have very low max stamina. So its very good to continue abusing the half stamina to raise your stamina cap and gather more mythril for pulls. Make sure you get as far in the events as you can. You can probably get at least to  difficulty if you abuse RWs. Use this calendar to see when events are ending and starting. Alternatively you can use this gamefaqs calendarA full overview of whats on the anniversary bannersTheres also an FFIX banner that runs during the anniversary but I dont recommend you pull for that right now. You can check the details here Theres some other specifics you have to work on like abilities and record materia but I feel like Im already overloading you with information. Right now your top priority should be getting mythril so you can pull on banner  though. So keep doing those dungeons if you can.,FFRecordKeeper,dfisrgj,3,t5_3779b

11400448,0,t3_62l0i7,Its not just SBs  assuming youre at the damage cap both atk amp mag having a few bits of elemental equipment certainly does help boost damage. Having two on a character is like giving them a L RM for that element on top of whatever boost they get from RM. In most cases I feel  empowerimperil or  if imperil is a wrathlifesiphoner plus some elemental gear is enough to get close to if not hitting for s across the board on a neutral boss. Obviously cant bring  dedicated elementalers so RW is either empower or imperil depending on the particular relics Im lacking  unless its weak in which case I pick whatever. For slight weaknesses Id drop to  empowerimperil and for weak bosses Id drop imperil completely and try to fit in  empowerers in some sort of frankenparty. In regards to OSB empower combos vs. BSB empower spam I dont really discriminate OSB is nice for weak phase bursting BSB is nice for lengthy fights like Torments certain AoE fights and special event superbosses. Both have their places where they shine but work equally well regardless. Also  dragoons and spellblades with empower SSBs that lack either OSB or BSB may benefit from access to  skills to compensate for lack of a burst technique other than SSB spam ,FFRecordKeeper,dfo85rj,2,t5_3779b

11405639,0,t1_dfom62t,I believe that works well but it requires that you have Terras EnElement also.  Most casualFPminnows arent going to have both and will be using the mage OSB in a vacuum.  Furthermore if the boss is immune or resistant to fire youre only going be getting the nonelemental damage multiplier.  With your specific relics and situation maybe it is the best DPS possible but it wont be for everyone.  For instance Ive already got a mage setup with three high DPS mage BSBs Fujin Alph Edea  I havent run the math but its DPS is pretty insane.  Even hitting the damage cap with every cast it would be difficult for a single OSB to match.  However I just drew Ashes OSB after already having her BSB so Ill test it out and see how it compares.,FFRecordKeeper,dfotc6s,-2,t5_3779b

The thing is not only is English a living language meaning it changes over time but the singular usage is used in even Shakespearean writings something oft held as a high standard of writing within schools.

Something Ive noticed that really changes a fight with this current Nemesis round seems like instantcast Last Stand Edge SSB Raijin SSB.So Im looking for more things like that!

11504265,0,t3_643rr3,Just to add to a few other things brought up  Entrust is really good if you have an OSB or some other SB youd like to spam. Several strategies for beating Nemesis rely on it. That said R is almost always sufficient I took mine to R but didnt get a third cast out of it. Maybe if youre in a multiplayer battle and want to entrust more than one character youd need more. Or maybe if you have Galuf youd use the crazy strategy with two Entrusts. Not recommended without extreme dedication!  Some abilities like Meteor Crush and Fires Within arent necessarily the most amazing abilities but use Fire and Earth Orbs which have less competition with other skills. These can be some of the safer options to overhone until other skills are released that actually use these orbs.  Dark Zone has a potential future replacement Dread Heal or whatever it gets translated into which does two hits of dark magic damage and heals the user. For now lots of fights that are weak to dark can be beaten simply be summoning a Cid Raines BSB RW if you want to go that route instead of Dark Zone.  There will be more Sharpshooter skills released later with other elements. And the list of Sharpshooter users will be expanded including some questionable choices like mages despite the skills being physical. Oddly the damage multiplier will be higher than the  Spellblades though some characters like Celes have a strong affinity for Spellblades due to Record Spheres and Legend Materia.  The Ninja skills can really shine if you have a good ninja. The resistanceignoring properties makes these extremely good for some highlevel fights with elemental weaknesses e.g. bringing Raging Storm against the VII Torment.  And a lot of the skills are niche. Lightning Dive with Kains BSB was brought up. The Machinist skills with Lagunas future BSB will be another option. Typically if its in one of the rarer ability schools its not worth using except for specific circumstances or with specific characters.,FFRecordKeeper,dg00bun,1,t5_3779b

Like others I would recommend mages in all truth because you do have a solid foundation but if you want mixed heres my attempt at it.Vaan once his burst is active has very little cast time on either commands which are basically magic amp armour breakdown. I generally go Mug Bloodlust gt lifesiphon x gt BSB gt Com  gt Com  gt MB gt ... double broken magic triple broken armour and a self buff. very high amp consistent damage of rapid command uses debuffs also help party membersGilgamesh brings Sentinel on use of his BSB and the command  retaliate. Not a gamechanger VS endgame bosses but will probably mitigate some attacks and return his own noting the broken defense via Vaan. He also brings command s utilitarian dispel and Saints Cross self esunaregen on top of really good holy damage.Ramzas power breakdown  full break allows for more mitigation that stacks with Vaan giving you a boss with power amp magic triple broken darn near a reverse wall at this point and a quad broken armour. Then you shout...Penelos BSB is instant use panic button for nice heals and the command  is actually pretty decent when you consider how badly debuffed the enemies are at this point.Raines is the odd man out but between morimetamorphcom hes got  magic selfbuffs.

Further complicating the scenario is the loaded out Thunder God that I managed to score his OSB and BSB.

After much frustration I get the bright idea to try some mage meta instead. I got loads of cool mage stuff in the anniversary after all...  Maria and Cid  the OTHER Awesome Cid  starred in this one. Basically let them go to town with bursts and support them. Fran BSB was invaluable for keeping things under control while Maria and Mr. Raines blasted the crap out of everything.

11589894,0,t3_65doe1,Bullet  appears to be a combination of a couple of lag issues Ive seen beforeSometimes when Im lagging and select an abilitySB the character will start casting it but then instead of casting the ATB bar will fill up and ask me to select again. This appears to desync the client with the host so even though the first action is still queued you can input another one which will get queued after your first input and until you resync every action you input will be queued and used one turn later sometimes I can resync if I wait a few seconds without inputting any action with that character who will then cast the queued action on its own.Sometimes the client doesnt appear to register the current buffs on a character so a nonlethal hit appears to be lethal and you can see them going down but then you can see them alive and kicking without any raise effect since they never actually died.Edit Just saw that your Raines died by his own doom timer so I guess it was just that his action was supposed to go off before he died but because of sync issues you saw him die before it actually was casted.,FFRecordKeeper,dg9q0fx,1,t5_3779b

It might not seem like much but it does add up particularly when you dont have a BSB to give you unlimited healing.As for your Paine it kind of depends if you want to spend the orbs. With Enwater she can probably hit some pretty high numbers with Watera Strike or Engulfing Strike. Not sure what support you have for her.

11678378,0,t1_dgjqz0i,For Yshtola vs Eiko Bursts are better for extending hones which may be helpful in long battles like Torment and Apocalypse Multiplayer. Additionally Yshtolas Command  is an instant cast Curaja which can be extremely useful against enemies who attack quickly. The Stoneskin effect has its upsides and downsides additional damage protection but less SB generation from taking hits to name a couple. Eikos Ultra has a hastega which may be redundant with your other hastegas though the instant cast and Last Stand can get you out of dire situations.Shout is a better buff for a physical team than Vessel of Fate. That being said Vessel of Fate can stack with other buffs like Meteor Crush Steal Power Wrath etc. leading to potentially higher Attack stats if your team has Monks or Thieves or some other class.

11739815,0,t1_dgqoxuu,Youd still have to do  turns unhasted and essentially doing no damage during that time. You only get  casts for your RW and since you say youre using Wall that means the fight needs to end in  seconds or youre going to wipe. My A team is almost always my healer with medica with MM and my hastega with DMT and one of the  DPS handle Wall as the RW. In my first turn Ive got all mitigation setup hastega setup and usually boostga. This means after turn  Im full throttle. If youre full throttle at turn  then you may struggle with fights that frontload a lot of damage out the gate.,FFRecordKeeper,dgqqkqp,2,t5_3779b

11741600,0,t3_67jixd,You have two stacking faithga between Garnets magdef SSB and Braskas SSB. Consider bringing both and RWing a Onion Knight for your third stacking faithga  hastega. If you still need to RW wall you can probably get away with TyroLarsaPorom for starter haste and having Braska or Garnet cast their faithga later in the fight.Heres some upcoming mage stackers by no means a comprehensive list Upcoming FFT event has Ramza USB that buffs atkmagmnd also Raphas BSB with a magres entry. Rikku gets a atkmag buff on banner  about three events from now Edward gets a magmnd quickzap  SSB in about  events from now on that events banner . Banner  has Poroms BSB with a magmnd and medica entry also Tellahs atkmagquick hit SSB even though it dooms him. Selphies magmnd BSB recurs about  events from now. Doesnt have entry medica but has niche uses with a cmd dispel. Gogo FFV banner  has Gogos hat atkmaghastega SSB. Aside from Lucky Draws and what not its the first instance of any sort of faithgahastega I could find... Lightning USB banner  has one of Serahs bows with a magmndhastega SSB. Probably a little bit better than Garnets since it gives you hastega plus it stacks! Raines BSB recurs on this banner as well which is not just another magdef buff for your group but one of the if not the best mage BSBs in the game.Im sure theres more but those are the ones that stuck out the most as being possibly helpful for your team comp.,FFRecordKeeper,dgqxuxn,2,t5_3779b

11747336,0,t3_67lr5j,Im in the same situation as you. What I did was trying to pull wall in KC but in the end I got everything but Gilg BSB and Wall.So what I did was RW Wall. It was a pain in the arse because it was my only choice but I could clear all content I faced.Nowadays Im using Ysh for Wall with Wrath and a second healer with BSB or useful medica. It is a way more defensive approach but it works.In the end this game is all about nostalgia and variety the more you have the merrier.Hope it helps!,FFRecordKeeper,dgrl92m,3,t5_3779b
11749593,0,t1_dgrhvxs,I completely agree with you. Its in my nature to feel good helping other people in general so i just consider carrying bad players as a challenge. But bad players are bad players and its not just merely making us feel better that we rant but we do this to make these bad players realize that theyre doing something wrong and hope that they change their ways for the better. In that way they would not need to be carried and they can fairly contribute in the future. In an ideal world every player has to at least read Dr. Mogs advises to prepare for a battle. I would totally understand and not care at all if its an individual battle but since its a team effort of course I care.,FFRecordKeeper,dgrugha,2,t5_3779b
11750179,0,t1_dgrukti,Yeah thats the situation I found myself in. If the boss is weak to Dark then Ill bring in a Darkness character.
