3221823,0,t1_covqw67,I understand your point. Even though Im not that into their discography also I havent heard Great Annihilator and White Light yet but Ill give them a go I think I finally get the idea the whole concept  and you are  right  some of their first songs are really dark brutal filthy... but I think its not my cup of tea. Personally I prefer more their postrock drone maybe ambient tracks. For example in some songs from SFTB I can really hear some inspirations took from Brian Eno and I really love it! ,swans,covy0rw,2,t5_2vcqw

8617012,0,t1_d6ip1hp,Actually it does make sense. Like all forms of media you can only store a finite amount on information on the medium until it is lost. The same goes for vinyl but instead of lost information its lost quality because theyre not made to store that much information.I dont hear any distortion becuase their is none. It makes sense to drop it becuase it would be wasteful and useless to print the last  minutes of a song on a desperate disc. This goes for other songs like Bring The Sun and The Glowing Man because if time. This also goes for other songs  sometimes the order is off because of tiem constraints on that specific vinyl where a shorter song could be fitted it without loss of audio quality. You cant blame the record company for quality. They dont produce the vinyl  they ship the record molds to Germany and probably dont have time to quality check a  hour album for issues.You could always clean the record with proper solution. That works when my white albums starts skipping.,swans,d6iq4bm,1,t5_2vcqw
8746174,0,t1_d6yhy2q,yeah ive been trying to get into there older stuff. im a huge black flag fan who did a noise sort of thing not nearly on the same level of course with Damaged I and some of there later songs so its great to hear a band that really pioneered that style,swans,d6yxbyj,1,t5_2vcqw
8857886,0,t3_510sjs,The dude next to me at the Vancouver show got a good shot of The Knot I told him to upload it to youtube. Not sure about audio quality though.,swans,d7clclc,1,t5_2vcqw

9953422,0,t1_db4me3d,I havent quite listened through all of it. But I do love Helpless Child and The Sound. Personally I find instrumentals like Red Velvet Corridor utterly haunting. ,swans,db4yfm3,3,t5_2vcqw
10305341,0,t1_dcc5ex0,Didnt know that was why he decided to abandon the initial early Swans sound I always thought it was just natural progression since the moment Jarboe entered in the group since the transition between Cop to Greed to Holy Money to Children of God and then the folky era always seemed so effortless and instinctive.But yeah I agree that a true Swans MV would be almost impossible when I look at those that were made it just seemed like something that was never meant to be part of anything more than just a small release for a certain TV network or something.,swans,dcc5z76,1,t5_2vcqw
11116034,0,t3_5ylv7l,Like other people in the thread are saying Gira basically directs them plus even if there is improvisation in their live sets its not like its free jazz yknow? Its within a limited set of rules when I saw them live whenever Gira wasnt singing he was facing the band and everyone on stage was looking at him one of the moments which stuck out the most to me is when they played The Glowing Man the song and at that moment at  while he played his guitar he went more and more down to the floor as he wanted the band to keep going and add intensity he did the same when they pound on that chord on   and then he got up and lifted his guitar at the moments when they let their instruments ring and create tension and then he dropped again to the floor with his guitar and so on and so forth and at the drop at  he raised his hand and counted the . Yeah basically he visually leads them since theyre all wearing earplugs.,swans,derzrjj,7,t5_2vcqw
