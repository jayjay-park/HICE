5326288,0,t3_3nyypg,So EA and Activision really dont want you to get in touch with them. I went ahead and figured out how to do so directly. The EA link will take you to a website complaint form which is the closest I could find to what youre looking for before I threw my hands in the air and gave up. The Activision link is the email address but it took some looking and might not be current.
