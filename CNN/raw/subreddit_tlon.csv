1214110,0,t1_ci66ykt,You do say history is important but I feel like you need to stress that it is especially important early on in this creation process.  I mean suggesting a calender system is great but we havent even discussed what the intelligent life form is like on this planet that would come up with calender system.  I cant remember the author or the book title right now but one guy thought of this whole society comprised of intelligent descendants of sea urchins with  legs that reproduced asexually because he was sick of science fiction creating species that were basically humans with minor adaptions or monsters with tentacles.  We have the possibility to do anything with Tln but if we do things out of order instead of letting it evolve organically we risk imposing too much of our world onto Tln.  What if they have a base mathematical system because of their weird physiology or important some geological mark influenced their religion enough during their early days when they started to develop math?  What if they dont develop math until much later on like some modern huntergatherer societies?  But the reason for all of these things ties back to environment which comes before society.,tlon,ci67f3x,1,t5_325a5
