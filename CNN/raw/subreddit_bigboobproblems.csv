222627,0,t3_1wmy4w,Wow this post really pissed me off. I expected a bra review and instead encountered a girl pretending a free weight is a penis who dispenses false medical informationIm all for the message that skinny  healthy but not all of the inspiration messages she bashed are thinspo. Personally I dont think theres anything wrong with the statement If you dont work for it you probably dont deserve it and I think that its a healthy and motivating mentality in general  its not meant to bash other people its meant to push you to work hard for things you want whether thats health school career success etc. Same thing with the this is what dedication looks like image  dedication may look different for different people but this is what one kind of dedication to fitness looks like isnt as pithy. I dont think these fitspo images are dangerous or scary in the way that thinspo is the nothing tastes as good as thin feels and bones are beautiful kind of thing. edit I also think that stop eating garbage and get off your ass is in the snarky spirit of someecards pretty funny and accurate for most people who want to lose weightget healthier  its basically what I tell myself whenever I feel like complaining that my blood pressure is going up or my pants are cutting into my stomach. Obviously for someone who already eats a healthy diet and is active but still wants to lose weight for whatever reason that statement wouldnt be accurate but Id hazard a guess that for most people who are trying to get fitter theres margin for improvement in both diet and activity lefel.,bigboobproblems,cf3swef,12,t5_2ubfr

Im ridiculously uncomfortable today in the torture device known as the panache arizawhich is so uncomfortable it borders on inhumane. It seems like lots of projection means that straps always dig in regardless of size.I like the look of ewas half cups and plunges but afraid my soft tissue might make me fall out of them.

If you can thinner bras rather than thicker. Be comfortable with a few bra lines or a nipple poke. Just stay away from bras that would cause noticeable lumps. No ones ever given me a look for a simple bra line.Over the bra something light and either natural fibers like linencotton or materials intended to help with heat. Avoid that whole layered look if youll be outdoors or without AC but consider layering pieces to take indoors  if youre like me when you dress for the weather outside inside is flat out COLD. With enough sweat cotton bogs down and becomes rather unpleasant but if youre just outside not exercising cotton should do fine.Tank tops and the like are nice but remember they expose your skin to the sun and do not add any layers for additional sweat evaporation.

4175695,0,t1_crvflh1,My friends and I used duct tape in marching band to secure our chests I was wearing a F my friends were G and GG at the time. It does work and gives some pretty crazy support for being tape. However its annoying to remove and its very sweaty. Duct tape is not breathable. I really dont recommend it for long events because of such especially events you want to stay fresh for!. After competitions we would get in a bath with some oil and slowly pull it off letting the water and oil do the work. Dont rip it off like a bandaid it hurts like hell and damages your skin. Also if you do want to go with any route using adhesives make sure to test them beforehand. Test test test and test again. I cannot stress this enough. If youre using duct tape youll need to do several test runs probably a week or more apart to not hurt yourself to work out any squareboobprofile you can get from the wide strips. If youre using an adhesivesilicone bra youll want to figure out how to put it on if it slides and if putting it in different positions effects support. If youre using lingerie tape to stick your braskindress together get used to using it. I say this because my senior prom was an absolute nightmare trying to figure out how to get the backing off the doublesided lingerie tape. And the first time I tried ducttaping my chest I definitely hurt myself taking it off and putting it back on over and over because we were going on stage in  hours and I kept ending up squareboobed.

Also narrower than the s and ch EM I used to wear. The gore was slightly higher than I expect in the plunge and wires are quite flexible which is something of note if you have heavy breasts.

7297589,0,t1_d27igoz, Okay first off breast surgery is a major surgery. Its not something you can just go out and do on a Tuesday afternoon and get back to your normal life on Wednesday. Eventually your parents and your doctor will all know. Recovery time will take weeks to months and you will need a responsible adult taking care of you. E.g. the first week you wont be able to lift your arms over your head or drive. Itll probably take  weeks before you can resume normal exercise. Google it. There are plenty of women who have shared their stories. If you can talk to your doctor about your reproductive health you should be able to talk about breast size. I know you may be embarrassed but he shouldnt be. Hes there to help. He has to know eventually. Breast reduction is not something you want done by your village doctor. You need a specialist who has experience. This may mean traveling to some place that has an experienced plastic surgeon. The less experience the physician has the more likely you are to be unhappy with your results. Ive read stories of women who were super happy with their result when dressed but still dont feel comfortable naked because of the way the scars healed or the way the nipple got grafted. You may need touchup procedures depending on how things heal. Research your specialist. Look at beforeafter photos of other surgeries theyve done. It matters. There are always risks with surgery. Any time youre put under anesthesia theres a risk. Any time someone cuts into your skin theres a risk. Every cut makes a scar. In a breast reduction pounds of fat are being cut out and your skin is being sewed shut in a different position. There will be scarring and how the scars fadeheal is partly determined by genetics and partly determined by the skill of the surgeon. For some people the scar seems to disappear. For some people theyll add a tattoo to hide it. The benefit of no backpain and betterproportioned figure have to outweigh the cost of the scar. Regarding breastfeeding that really depends on how much they take off. I know they do everything they can to preserve the nipple and it depends on how much tissue they remove around it. A lot of people lose feeling in their nipple and it takes years to get it back or it never comes back. Consider this however when you are pregnant your boobs will swell to even larger size. Youll have even more back and neck pain and then youll be navigating infant care with a baby thats smaller than and could potentially be smothered by your boob. If breastfeeding is important to you that is something you need to research before you get the procedure. It is not something Ive researched as I have no intention of having kids. It is possible that a doctor would perform a breast reduction on you as a teen but if your breasts are still growing you may wind up needingwanting another procedure later. It depends on your current pain level and how your breasts are affecting you mentally and socially. It may be worth it. Again this is something you must discuss with a plastic surgeon. ,bigboobproblems,d27opso,1,t5_2ubfr

8787838,0,t1_d73vdc8,I had a measurement check prior to losing some weight and fit into a K from Debenhams so if my logic is correct definitely correct me if its not since I lost  inches in under bust then my difference from bustunderbust would have increased by  inches which would be  cup size KgtKKgtL increase with the band going down by  band size? Which if that math is at all correct would put me right at a L then depending on the bra could move from there up or down. All other measurements leaning laying standing has a partial inch less change but that could even be hormonal fluctuations there are the same currently. The cups fit pretty well on the K leaning towards slightly too small when I first got them I would probably have put myself as a largefull K before now the band is getting too loose even on the tightest hook moving needing to adjust underwire up into crease multiple times a day from when I first got them I ordered  to switch around dayday to reduce the band deterioration less than  months ago I was wearing them on the loosest hooks though. So I think the fit of this bra now also fits a L being my current size?Feel free to correct any thing thats not accurate thats just how I understand bra measuring from what Ive read up on on here and a few other places!  ,bigboobproblems,d745jes,1,t5_2ubfr

Once youve measured yourself and read through the guides on ABTF make a measurementcheck post describe what you think your shape is as best you can and they will recommend some bras to try. You can then try them at Nordstrom if thats convenient or order them online Amazon has free shipping and returns and try them on at home. Ideally try at least a couple of different styles in a couple of different sizes because it will make it easier to figure out whether fit issues youre having are due to the size or the shape of the bra and that will help determine what to try next. Keep track of what you tried and what worked or didnt work about each bra. Then once youve tried on some bras make a fitcheck post. You can take pictures and make sure to keep the imgur album private but you dont have to take pictures you can just describe whats happening. ,bigboobproblems,dditel8,7,t5_2ubfr

It might be because it was one of the first tattoos I got but goddamn it was horrific.

Because we live in a judgmental society well always be our worst critic and it goes deeper than how we view our looks of course.Today I actually showed cleavage and though I could see and feel stares and glares it felt empowering not to really care about what others thought of me. I want to have that same confidence every day and I sincerely hope that all women have it also.
