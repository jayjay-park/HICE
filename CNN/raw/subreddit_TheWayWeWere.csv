585419,0,t1_cg6rkjo,I dont think shes actually a boxer.I looked up Elsie Connor in some contemporary newspapers. There was a woman by that name who was a performer in Earl Carroll Vanities a show that specialized in attractive scantilyclad women often in gender roles that would have been considered slightly shocking for the timee.g. a boxer. The date was  which would put be appropriate for this picture. The location Broadway is right too.She didnt look like much of a boxer to me which is why I looked her up. Womens boxing was pretty marginalized in the s and s. You almost never see actual boxers from this eramostly just models and actresses dressed up to look like theyre boxing. When you see a real boxer from this era they look much more...I dunno...determined.Also with those arms she wouldnt have lasted long in the ring.Edit And here she is in the theaterAccording to Vaudeville old amp new  an encyclopedia of variety performers in America vaudeville superstar Fanny Brice performed in a women boxing skit in the  edition of Earl Carrolls  Vanities the Ziegfeld Follies so I would guess this might be a similar case.Heres Elsie Connors page at Playbill She was in a few shows including Fioretta with Fanny Brice and Louise Brooks.Edit Im becoming obsessed!Apparently she was Miss Cleveland  and a finalist for Miss Ohio and in  she married a mobster named Phillip Kastel who according to Wikipedia had a habit of stealing from chorus girls.
