4343911,0,t3_37cona,One of the things that I really love about the AGE system is the stunt die mechanics. If you roll doubles on any of the three dice that you roll you get to use whatever you rolled on the dragon die  the die thats a different color  to do stunts. You have to narrate what youre using them for. It acts as a way to bring the players directly into the narrative of the game. ,titansgrave,csfag41,2,t5_37or3

4607781,0,t3_3e46im,Regarding this next levelup  I totally understand cutting it down.  But for consistencys sake and those interested in the crunchy bits I wouldve like to have seen more informationespecially because of the enthusiasm shown for working leveling up into the party dynamic and narration for level  in one of the previous episodes.EDIT  I need to stop making posts whilst watching the show... uwil s reference to The Humpty Dance made all the girls adore me.justgrabthem in the biscuitsSorry for the grammar but I love this show so glad you aired it during the summer ,titansgrave,ctbe7qz,5,t5_37or3

4825840,0,t3_3gz7vv,The official rules should be in the Fantasy AGE book but I wouldnt expect to see any significant mechanical differences from grenades in Dragon Age.They probably dont have published rules for shooting potions from a launcher but if I were GMing Id allow the launcher to give extended range and accuracy over a thrown potion.,titansgrave,cu2u4mf,1,t5_37or3

10778006,0,t3_5u1oxh,Before I ordered the books I bought the PDF and gave it to an online printing company they charge less than a school and offer better quality  i paid like  bucks for the fantasy age core book. Since i used a local service and youre presumably not in Germany Im sorry I cant help you by providing the site.  But still best of luck for you to find somebody that is willing to share his used rulebooks.,titansgrave,ddro936,1,t5_37or3
