Bedbugs are extremely tiny and can hide in the smallest of locations in the structure andor furniture. Likely the last tenant had them and perhaps didnt react to the bites or they did and just bailed.gtShould I pay the bill for Pest Control?No.gtI was told that I should get back to bed to act as a bait.Correct they spray what they can and then lure more into the cracks and crevices and hopefully more get infected.However you CAN protect the bed and other resting type furniture with a plastic sheet shield to prevent the bites you still lure them in.gt I did just that but after  minutes this little bloodsucking fers started coming out behind pillow including small white babies. They stayed on the bedding for some time. It looked like they sightseeing...dear god.You need to either get mattress encasements thick kind or they tear or drape a . plastic sheet over the unmade bed then wash and high heat dry the bedding and make up the bed on top of the plastic. Take a shower and don fresh clean clothes before using the bed.More details on this linkgtI dont know chemicals used but they left white stains on furniture and were smelly. Sounds like Temprid its too bad its a repellent so that doesnt assist in their quick demise.gtHow long it takes to kill them. Is this spray actually working?Yea its working but its going to be very slow will take several months and if the neighboring units are also not treated as a precaution then they will be back.gtHow much heat treatment can cost. Right now for four visits we have to pay Thats about right they will be back again and again rotating pesticides to defeat their immunity.Heat treatment prices varies of course its more up front for a large knockdown and then followed up with a spray routine for the stragglers. I wouldnt spend the money if its not your house a multiunit and they will run next door so all the surrounding ones also have to be treated and they default to using pesticides anyway.gtI slept on leather sofa. Can they also be there?Oh yea they will be coming for you now that you changed locations. They dont care they bite anywhere.Once an item is in a bedbug infested location its assumed its also infested as bedbugs move around.gtIm loosing it so any advice will be helpful. Thank you all.Since your under the care of an exterminator the only thing you can do is everything thats noninsecticide related on this link until its cleared up then you can do the CimeXa dusting as a preventative.Good luck its going to be awhile before they are all gone. However if the infestation is small it could be gone quickly. I dont think so if there were first stage nymphs around.Be sure to check out the links on the side bar or sticky post so you learn what works.,Bedbugadvice,d3zb7g7,2,t5_32mzq

11545393,0,t3_64ns6d,The other stuff may be decaking ingredients or lubricants.I have read about some that has pheromone included but I would expect that to be spelled out better and cost more. The pheromones hexenal and octenal are alarm triggers and make the bugs scoot around a lot and pick up more Cimexa.,Bedbugadvice,dg4o7sf,1,t5_32mzq
