I dont know if I have a weird perspective because I watched the entire show online in about a month and had never seen an episode before that but I didnt hate the RachelJoey thing. I bought that they clicked and had a lot of fun together and maybe wanted to be more but I was glad in the end that they realized they couldnt do it. I wasnt a fan of lovesick Joey but the maybe the fact that it only lasted a few days of my marathon as opposed to like  years if you were watching it live made it pretty bearable. ,howyoudoin,cfkqxsu,3,t5_2tqcj

1772815,0,t1_ck1qozj,I dunno. Monica was very distraught about Richard so I think we can forgive her behavior. Phoebe was perfectly ready but then her dress got ruined. Most people I know wouldve gone home at that point to change which wouldve caused an even longer delay. Instead she tries to solve the problem here which is commendable. Rachel was just trying to look good for Ross and she has probably had a habit of being fashionably late her entire life.Chandler and Joey were the real troublemakers here but I can see their pointofview as well. They knew that theyd need only a couple of minutes to get ready and were waiting for Monica and Rachel to be almost ready at which point theyd rush over and get ready themselves just in time. They didnt see the point of getting dressed up and sitting around when others would be late anyway.I blame the whole thing on Pheobes dress getting ruined. If that hadnt happened she couldve helped Monica get ready faster and Rachel wouldnt have wasted time picking out a dress for Phoebe.

He was hurt vulnerable and the girl at the bar saw that and took advantage of him. Rachel made a conscience decision both times to end the relationship and invite Mark over.

So rather than try to talk about things like his friends might want to converse with him he defaults to stating things condescendingly to avoid the snarky blowback.And I dont think Ross is a huge jerk to Rachel.  I think he was overly jealous and possessive somewhat understandable when his wife left him after he encouraged her to find new interests and had a few moments of being condescending.  I cant think of times where he was a straight up jerk to her can you give me some examples?

However when he hears Marks voice in the background he again hangs up the phone like a child without having a discussion first.He also admits what he did was cheatinggt ROSS What now youre not even talking to me? Look Rachel IIm sorry okay Im sorry I was out of my mind. I thought Id lost you I didnt know what to do. Come on! Come on how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? II dont cheat right I thats not me Im not Joey!I dont really agree with OP  that Ross is super annoying doesnt deserve Rachel etc. I actually find him hilarious especially in season . But I have always sided with Rachel in the break up discussion. Ross was apologetic and remorseful until Rachel wasnt really ready to forgive him and accept his actions immediately and only then did he get defensive and take on the whole we were on a break! mantra because he was angry he screwed up his relationship with Rachel and it was easier for him to blame on Rachel being unreasonable rather than accept even an ounce of personal responsibility.,howyoudoin,d2smhx1,3,t5_2tqcj

She wanted to go on a break he overheard Mark on the phone he was heartbroken and drunk perhaps excuses but realistic circumstances that led him to sleep with another woman. I never thought he cheated on Rachel still dont. Was it a shitty thing to sleep with another woman that quickly? Yes of course but once Rachel told Ross they  needed to  take a break and then invite the person who has exacerbated the problems in the relationship Mark to her apartment Ross is free to think that the relationship is over thus free to sleep with another woman. If Ross is incapable of letting his pride go and sincerely apologize for the breakup so is Rachel.
