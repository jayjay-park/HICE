6401143,0,t1_cz15abf,gt Owen DalBiographic DetailsNameAliases   Owen DalhousieAge   ResourcesAssets   Physical Description   Mentality  Backstory InCharacter Reputation Powers Abilities and EquipmentProposed Tier   Tier One. Owens powers do not particularly give him much of an advantage in a direct confrontation not being combat oriented. Powers  Owens possesses the supernatural gift of mediumship allowing him to communicate with the dead and summon the spirits of those close to him. Owen is able to make physical contact with spirits as if they were flesh and blood. While being able to speak with dead people is convenient for solving murder mysteries that doesnt particularly mean much to him seeing as its often difficult to get useful information from the deceased should they be in the process of passing on into an afterlife because most dead people he doesnt have much of any significant bond with. By comparison what matters much more to him is  to being able to  summon the spirit of his former canine companion Odysseus who is ecstatic to be able to be a good boy. As ghost Odysseus benefits from being intangible from most forms of harm while still  being able to catch and take down criminals.Resources Equipment  Miscellaneous Skills  Strength Movement  DefencePerceptionAwareness     Owen has sharp wits from being an experienced police officer but having the powers of mediumship to sense spirits ghosts and other supernatural phenomena give him a sort of danger sense that makes it difficult to catch him off guard.  When he has his ghost canine summoned his ability to communicate with spirits grants him canine levels of hearing and smell by proxy. Fighting AbilityTrained as a police officer Owen is fully capable of taking down an unarmed nonpowered human without too much effort and is trained to shoot accurately with a pistol. More significantly however is that in a criminal apprehension he can rely on Odysseus to take down a suspect. Danger  Besides being armed with a pistol Owen relies on Odysseus if he finds himself in a serious confrontation. The ghost dog is about as effective in combat as a regular police dog with the added benefit of being able to pass through solid objects and not be harmed by most things not meant to harm ghosts. WeaknessesOwen himself lacks the means to fight against well armed or superpowered opponents easily relying on Odysseus to be able to take down and subdue an opponent before they can get to him directly. Odysseus himself is vulnerable to things that can explicitly harm spirits such as some forms of magic or holy exorcisttype abilities. If banished somehow Owen has to wait at least an hour before being able to resummon Odysseus. ,Galihan,czh8tz3,1,t5_32eic
