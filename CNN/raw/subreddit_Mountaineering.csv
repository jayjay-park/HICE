2475815,0,t3_2nw357,Rapace  Ideal  season boot that can tackle the approach as well have the ability to kick light steps. Super light comfortable last. Great if you plan on more spring and summer outings where more flexibility on dirt and rock will be nicer on your feet.Raven Combi  More or less a beefier Rapace with a stiffer sole higher cuff and thicker more abrasion resistant outer material. Condor  Warmer thicker and closer to a true  season amount of weather protection. Stiffest sole and upper materials that will be keeping your feet on Cloud  in the alpine but maybe a little uncomfortably hot and bulky in spring conditions or on approach without a lightweight trail runner to supplement until truly needed.My two cents is that you try on a few different brands and see what fits your foot best. It is definitely worth the investment in quality footwear that fits well if you are serious about mountaineering. I own Scarpa Mount Blancs for my  season option and La Sportiva Trango Cubes for a lighter  season boot. Salewa is an awesome company and makes great boots but if it doesnt fit then it doesnt fit. Also look into some Superfeet or similar aftermarket insole to really dial in the fit and keep your arches and feet muscles happy in those stiff boots!

Do you have a preference on battery type? Would you like something rechargeable? Whats a decent price for you?Outdoor Gear Lab has an awesomely comprehensive headlamp review. Take a close look at their battery life testing and advice  headlamp battery life claims are wildly exaggerated by headlamp manufacturers. You want to look for a light which has regulated output so the light doesnt dim after only a couple hours of use.I agree with their recommendation of the Black Diamond ReVolt. Thats the headlamp I have and its pretty nice. Runs on AAAs which are easy to find but comes with rechargeable ones and the charging is built in to the light with USB charging. Has a spot mode and a flood mode adjustable brightness and red mode. Its more than enough light for use around camp or for hiking at night. ,Mountaineering,crimoqh,2,t5_2tbyb

5879356,0,t3_3vsbjh,L isnt too big for a weekend really a L backpack probably only weighs  or  lbs more than a L backpack of the same construction type. On Rainier youll need a heavier sleeping bag and more layers than you probably carry on a weekend trip. Im not sure if you carry a tent or use the shelter at Muire you could probably get by with a L pack if you dont carry a tent otherwise probably something in the  area.BTW You cant just compare packs based on claimed volume different packs have different layouts which can be more or less efficient. The most efficient layout is a single compartment but having more pockets can help organize. If you have a L pack where L is in pockets it isnt going to pack as much as a simple L pack with a single compartment. It may make finding things easier but it is less volume efficient.nd BTW I think IMG rent out packs dont they? Maybe just buy something for your own weekend backpacking in the L range and rent one for Rainier.Edit words,Mountaineering,cxqbdt0,3,t5_2tbyb

But the Never Summer is down so its about  lbs lighter and a F bag should be fine for almost everything I want to do right?. Alternatives Kelty Dualist  MH Lamina Z Bonfire or Torch Western Mountaineering antelope or puma if I win the lotteryYou never really talked about where you are or what you want to do but reconsider your sleeping bag choices.A  deg bag is REALLY warm.  Like warm enough for winter on Rainier or shoulder season on Denali.  There is no reason a beginner mountaineer would need that unless they lived in the Arctic.  I would recommend a  degree down bag it will be good enough for most shoulder season stuff and anywhere in the lower  in summer.  If you plan on winter camping in the Whites Canada or maybe high in the rockies that might not be enough but I doubt you want to do that anyway.Warmer isnt better for sleeping bags unless you need it.

9393921,0,t3_596g60,Lots of good advice in here. I will tell you one thing you can do now or in the weeks leading up to summer is get in some high intensity workouts that get you breathing hard. That preparation plays just as big of a part in avoiding altitude sickness as hydration and nutrition the day you are peakbagging does. And be wary unlike what one redditor said I have read and experienced that many people that get altitude sickness will get it between  feet. Ive found if youre one of these people that keeping your heart rate down is a great way to fend it off.,Mountaineering,d96quyz,2,t5_2tbyb

9706717,0,t3_5e480j,Theyll work fine for snow climbing up to  degrees. Theyll even do OK on low angle ice. If you think youre going to climb anything more technical than that Id go with something like the Petzl Sarken or BD Sabretooth. Both of those do everything from trudge up glaciers to handling steep technical ice.,Mountaineering,da9k7gd,3,t5_2tbyb

10085526,0,t3_5k6j7u,OP you should focus at least some of your time on long hilly hikes with a pack on.  What you have been doing will also help but I think you need some more specific workouts.  Not sure what you live but if you can hike  miles with  feet of climbing do that type of thing once a week with weight in a pack.  Start around  pounds and work your way up to whatever you think youll be carrying on the mountain Id guess  but I dont really know your plan.Do whatever it takes to make room for this key workout even if it means giving up or reducing another workout.Make sure you go easy for  weeks before your climb so your body can recover.Also consider going for longer sustained runs with rolling hills instead of doing hill sprints.  A  miles run especially on trails translates well.,Mountaineering,dbm5uk5,4,t5_2tbyb

10347512,0,t1_dcgpypk,gtEdit I get osprey packs for free. Which is a good thing because I have to replace them at the end of season. They dont hold up as well as they used to. At least thats my experience.Interesting Ive never heard that complaint about them before. Dont they repair or replace all of their packs for free though? Seems like thatd get very expensive if theyre making packs that only last a season....,Mountaineering,dcgy7rk,1,t5_2tbyb

10783686,0,t1_ddpkpxm,by the time you have a liner inside the BD Guides which are already a two part glove you are going to have very restricted dexterity you might be better off with liners inside mitts and remove the mitt for anything that requires high dexterity. ,Mountaineering,dds9blj,1,t5_2tbyb
10819474,0,t3_5upxcb,I think you can generally get by with one set of boots for most PNW climbing. You kind of have a choice to make  you can use a lighter season boot which will be lighter more comfortable on rock and in warm temps but wont provide as much support on steep terrain or warmth in cold temps. A boot like this IMO is rarely suitable for Rainier but will suffice for about everything else. Or you can use a slightly beefier boot that will be suitable for Rainier plus shoulder seasons on other peaks plus usable for winter climbing on lower elevation routes. These boots will still work in the summer theyll just be a bit heavier and warmer than the others. They still arent really enough for true winter ascents on the higher volcanoes and are probably pushing it for shoulder season on Rainier. To me it seems like both boots you linked would probably work pretty well as a quiver of one boot  seems like the Weisshorn is more like the second boot I described where the Mtn. Expert is between the first and second. Id make your choice based on A fit and B where you plan to spend most of your time. Rock scrambles and snow slogs up the standard volcano routes? Mtn Expert. Front pointing on steep snow and ice? Weisshorn. But either would probably work fine for your applications. ,Mountaineering,ddvyarj,2,t5_2tbyb

11106294,0,t1_dequ7dz,I sweat a lot as well and getting my laying system down so I dont over heat and lose too much water through sweat has taken three mountaineering seasons to nail down. my trick for layering is as follows I wear performance underwear and a work out performance fabric shirt. No long underwear. Next for early season April June I wear running shorts and a synthetic long sleeve button down shirt. This gives me long sleeves if needed two secure button pockets for chapstick or other easy to lose items And then my ski bibs. This allows me to vent to skin level while moving and keep my temp regulated. I wear a thin nano puff vest and keep a wind proof jacket light weight soft shell a hard shell jacket and down puffy jacket in my pack at the top for easy grabbing. Anytime we stop for anything more than a time check I pull out my down puffy and throw it on and for longer breaks Ill put on a shell layer too. I keep a UV neck gator on and a ball cap while climbing when a helmet is not required and a wool beanie in the down puffy pocket that I throw on when we stop too. For gloves early season leather ski gloves with a liner for summer leather work gloves with a liner. I have found it is best if you go light and a bit cold for actual climbing but have warm layers ready for any stop more than a few minutes long.Just a tip from one sweaty mountaineer to another. Good luck on your climb stay safe and enjoy it! ,Mountaineering,deqw0da,1,t5_2tbyb

11638252,0,t3_65y5he,Yes I do squats.However weight lifting should be your SECONDARY focus when training for mountaineering not the primary focus.  Primary focus should be cardio preferably with the specificity of uphill hiking.  TFTNA recommends a single max strength routine a week combined with many many hours of cardio and muscular endurance work.Lifting weights  days a week is reducing the time and recovery you have available to do the specific work.,Mountaineering,dgf7j6x,4,t5_2tbyb

11750245,0,t3_679350,This is how its doneIts a viable technique but not without its problems. Ive experimented with it and found that it does indeed work. However sometimes it would get stuck for no apparent reason. I suspect rope stretch was playing a factor in not being able to get the right tension to pop the vertical piece. I got it to work with both ice axes and pickets and combinations of both but results were not consistent. ,Mountaineering,dgrx4cq,1,t5_2tbyb
