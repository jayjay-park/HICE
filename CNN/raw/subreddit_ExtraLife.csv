11146966,0,t3_5yxfv7,I work for a crowdfunding platform called Crowdera  I often stress this part but for any fundraising the preparation phase is the most important. This alone can take upto a months time. Depending on your goal and the number of supporterspledges you can gather during the preparation you can launch the campaign uptil three months before the actual event. ,ExtraLife,devhw4s,1,t5_2skks
