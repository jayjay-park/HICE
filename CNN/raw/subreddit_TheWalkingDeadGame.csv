Nonetheless I dont know how much work has to be done. Telltales games are clearly story driven and I assume that the overall story and the dialogue is either finished or done for the most part. What remains is the voice over and the actual gameplay textures models animations etc. Its not like I think its easy but I dont think either that  hours of gameplay would require such an amount of time. Especially since you basically just walk around do some easy point and click and follow scripts.Its probably a personal problem but I did not pay  bucks to wait a year before I can finally finish the games last episode.

1051012,0,t3_2658sq,Personally Id have much rather seen Lily return. Her departure was at the peak of her character and I think theres so much more they could have done with her. Id have loved to see a redemption arc where she feels remorse over killing DougCarley and the player can give Clem the option of trusting or distrusting her. Not to mention Kenny escaping the herd seems very far fetched while Lily was left alive without any doubts. ,TheWalkingDeadGame,chnr6k3,11,t5_2tzww
1054962,0,t3_266fvt,. I agree with you there one of the few things I despise in this game. Thats also the reason we know almost nothing about them.. I agree with you slightly in episode  when it started the ski lift climb for shits and giggles along with a big build up to Kennys return. But in episode  they made good points. Calm Sarah down youre friends. That thing breaks all the time. Unless somethings changed it cant hold much weight. She knows Luke. She can hide... Yes Carlos says youre friends even if false but you were closest.. Thats beacuse of the lack of option to go and talk to them. You find out Kenny is a fisherman if you talk to him at the farm I think you learn a lot of stuff from Chuck that was optional. . I think it makes sense once Caver came to the house you couldnt stay there it wasnt safe. Carvers group found you at the ski lodge and kidnapped you. The herd was the perfect and possibly only chance of escaping.. Of course it was obvious someone would return thats because they put it in the preview. Not everyone thought it would be Kenny despite the hinting because it seemed impossible for him to live. Im disappointed he just says I was lucky.. I didnt think itd be Caver that was being beaten because he was the main villain. Are you also sayign it was obvious Sarita would get bitten and that they would escape this episode? And that Kenny loses an eye?,TheWalkingDeadGame,cho7crx,3,t5_2tzww
1058736,0,t1_cho58wm,It isnt just that she was rude in her first impression. If you ask the pregnant lady what if her child needed help she snaps but you arent MY child. If you ask her questions about Carver she hedges and evades all through Episode . Where is the sense that this is a woman whose survival will also benefit Clems survival? There isnt any.Rebeccas arc is strange though. They set her up as something of an antagonist possibly one who cheated on her husband. Later its heavily implied she was raped. Does this still happen if you dont stay for the Carver beating? I dont think so.I just dont buy her being nice to Clementine. She seemed from the gitgo like someone who will steamroll Clem if Clem is in her way. Nothing Ive seen since has changed that opinion it only seemed like Rebecca forced politeness after she realized the rest of the group would no longer boot Clem.,TheWalkingDeadGame,chomsch,1,t5_2tzww

1473660,0,t1_cj0y5tx,I could make a list of all the choices they let Clem decide trust her with things I would never trust to a child and things her words have influenced. But like I said above I REALLY dont want to make a damn list about it I tried pointing out the major things I could pull off the top of my head. I dont know about you but I wouldnt trust a kid to make a decision like that wether or not she knows Kenny. Regardless her choice and decisions matter at least in the eyes of the other characters not so much in the actual game which is pretty much what OP is trying to get across. It doesnt matter what you choose because in the end the choice never makes a difference because the story only progresses in one way. I thought saying I had the walkie talkie in E would get the rest of the group out of a lot of shit instead no matter what Kenny will interrupt and protect Clem Now thats fine from a story standpoint I actually found it to be a really good and traumatic scene. But even if you make the choice it immediately doesnt matter because Kenny will stop you from saying anything. In the end Im still enjoying the story but Im not seeing much of a difference between paying  to watch a story I choose the decisions for and watching any random person play through it. I hope Telltale fixes that in the last two episodes but damn its really far into it now.EDIT To follow up with that walkie talkie scene youre also given the choice to help Kenny or restrain Sarita first I dont know why youd ever not attempt to help Kenny whos getting his fucking face beat in but even if you dont help I believe Sarita gets knocked out instead and the scene is for the most part unchanged. I havent seen that scene yet because EVERYONE Ive watched play through it helps Kenny its just not a hard choice which is another thing OP is trying to point out.,TheWalkingDeadGame,cj0zxyc,0,t5_2tzww

This is real life and people say shit that will shock you and remind you of the worst stuff youve ever lived through.What you did was essentially the internet version of a scenario where a guy is entertaining a circle of friends with potentially offensive but well measured jokes and you just butt in and ask him to please let you know next time hes gonna be joking about a potentially touchy subject in the future.No offense dude and all my sympathies but you have no case here. Ill commend you for not being profane or outright entitled. You were rude in a wellmannered way though and im being straight with you about it... which i guess could be seen as rude too. You gotta know that no one would treat the subject like that if they knew that someone in the circle had a tough time with the subject but he didnt and someone wont either in about an hour. What youre asking just isnt feasible in a community as large as reddit and as a person whos seen just how bad tiptoing can go i wont back any initiative to start having triggerwarnings everywhere. Itll be five seconds until it gets fucked and we get trigger warning shitty parents posts authored by teenagers all over reddit. The ultimate potential outcome is that all and any discussion can drown in people accosting each other over each their own view of how to be considerate and PC about a subject and eventually you cant talk shit or breathe without warning the guy beside you. Who knows. maybe his sister died in a fit where she refused to breathe in order to get a teddy...Im sorry for you but why was that our business to start with? Im sorry that your day got fucked by it and im sorry that youre reading this from a perspective that im angry or attacking you. Im not. Im asking you to be realistic and reasonable. Your initial post was not an adult or wellconsidered action to take. Quite the contrary now im sitting here with a turdgrenade and have to be really freaking careful about how i go about this while not sliding into insensitive territory bordering on fucking soulless asswipe.

1778307,0,t1_ck38w9j,I feel the same way.  I never liked Luke.

I didnt even try to save him because I felt ZERO attachment to him.  The only characters I loved out of season  were Kenny and Jane.

1778827,0,t3_2evlvi,Kenny was depressed as hell in episode . He didnt feel like he had anything to live for. So season  kenny works with his character perfectly. He seems fairly calm in episode  but you can tell hes still on edge at the idea of losing people. in episode  it comes out a lot more with carvers presence. Then in episode  he loses sarita. he goes nuts just like what wed expect. Then he bonds even stronger to clem and the baby because they are ALL he has left. So I do think it works with his character. Every time he has someone he loves they get taken from him and hurts him deeper and deeper each time it happens. His behavior is just an amplified version of season  kenny. He wants to protect his family the only difference is he took a lesson in badass and can actually do it now. Ill admit its sad seeing kenny going from what he did in season  to the monstrous person in season  but I will say it works.Also I dont know how hard the game leans on you to kill him considering how many people didnt. I mean I did but a majority didnt.,TheWalkingDeadGame,ck3djgy,8,t5_2tzww
1779876,0,t1_ck3gg3i,What really fucking gets me about Arvo is that no matter how nice you are he will still shoot you! Even if you ask to come with them and give them your gun willingly. What the fuck? Him running away at the lake didnt even bother me that much since his running didnt really cause Lukes death or anything. I dont think Luke even tried to chase after them or anything. I dont blame him for that one.I understands hes mad because hes being treated as a prisoner and because he lost his group and sister has nothing more to lose as you say but that shit wasnt my fault. I didnt steal his shit and I tried constantly to be nice to him and then he shot me. At least on my first playthrough I screamed calling Jane and Kenny but replaying and giving up and wanting to come with them still got me shot despite all my attempts to be nice.Oh well I guess this is the whole illusion of choice shit rearing its ugly head again. No way Telltale would let us have a nice outcome from that one scene we wouldnt have gotten the Lee flashback otherwise.

1781602,0,t3_2evlxx,I made a post about the same thing but it got swallowed up.There are many different rational reasons behind either decision that are covered in this sub but I honestly wasnt really thinking about that in the heat of the moment. I shot Kenny just because given the deaths that I had seen so far this season I was betting that Jane would die very gruesomely. In this series I found it personally easier to cope with gunshotrelated deaths because for some reason or another Telltale doesnt animate gore with them and the characters die quickly. When theyre killed handtohand either from another person or a walker its another story Carver Sarah Sarita etc. That turned out to be the case with Kenny who simply collapsed and gave his heartfelt soliloquy before dying.On the other hand with Jane I was getting huge Saving Private Ryan flashbacks. I was the Upham to Janes Mellish. Hearing her own knife twist into her chest her screams for Clem to help turn wordless from the pain and loss and the death rattle...was not something I was prepared to witness. So I pulled the trigger.Then I watched how she actually dies to confirm my fears and she just dies with a brief sigh. Come on Telltale at least make her death have some oomph like you did with far worse characters and in far less important situations. Its the fucking climax to the season.,TheWalkingDeadGame,ck3q3xp,1,t5_2tzww

While raising my gun I knew I had to kill Kenny.. but I also realised that Clem could not survive alone.. And I did not trust Jane anymore.. So I let Kenny kill her..

I want to really feel like the relationships matter and that I have a choice with whom Im cultivating them with. For instance I never forgave Kenny for leaving me trapped under a door when we raided the pharmacy and I like to think Lee let Clem know that Kenny couldnt always be relied on. When Kenny returned it was nice to see a familiar face after all Clem had been through but it wasnt a euphoric moment because the relationship we all developed with Kenny was our own yet I feel the writers assumed affection. I dont want to fall into a pattern where a character getting more lines or revealing something personal means theyre going to die. Happy birthday Luke.

A survivalist to the core.My Clementine chose to save Jane because she was the obvious choice. Kenny had started going off the rails and it was always going to be a risk traveling along with him. Not to say it didnt hurt but it made sense. You say your Clementine still has some innocence in her  mine has just about none. Shes been through way too much.I base this on my first playthrough which I consider my own canon story as it was motivated by decisions based on emotions and reactions rather than just to see what happened as in later playthroughs. Youre not wrong when you say you dont think its in her character. But her character is what we shape it to be in our individual playthroughs.

10165823,0,t1_dbwc8n8,Gabe is immature an edgelord a liability and hes honestly just a horrible survivor. Clementine is kind helpful community driven morals high intelligent and can manage herself. So yes you can see why people dont want this to occur their personalities are horribly different and honestly Clementine shows no interest in relationships and still thinks theyre gross. The only character shes warmed up to a bit so far is Javier and I think if you give them enough time theyll be like a brother and sister type of thing but I dont see any prospects in Gabe hes like Ben but more agitated and edgy. If they made Gabe a respectable character then I wouldnt have an issue I think Id still have the issue being we dont even play Clem so we cant say fuck off Gabe no matter what but I think if Gabe wasnt as annoying as he is right now and that he didnt turn out to be a fuckup Id be way more open to a Gabe x Clem thing but as of now I detest the idea of it even occurring.,TheWalkingDeadGame,dbwcon4,12,t5_2tzww

That speech in season  I want that... that ruthless deconstruction of whatever perception the viewerplayer previously had of a character. The Winchester brothers. Theyre trained monster hunters and they could literally single handedly save the world while sacrificing themselves for each other and being overly dramatic. Zo Nightshade Thalia Grace and the hunters of Artemis from Percy Jackson. Theyre kind of like the Oceanside group in TWD. The Man In Black from Westworld is also highly capable but lacks morals.

10272032,0,t3_5n170e,I really didnt like Larry but I tried to be civil with him despite trying to kill Lee.What were your favouriteleast favourite Larry moments?Favorite Larry Ive got charm coming out of my ass!  Totally lol.Least favorite Punching Lee and wanting to ice Duck in the pharmacy.  That was cold.How could Larry have been improved?Acknowledge that Lee saved his life by getting meds be more thankful when feeding him or siding with Lilly too.  Larry was a really great character actually despite everyone hating him so many tried to save him.  Could have been they did it more for Lilly though.  Did you side with Larry at the pharmacy?Hell no.  Its ME before anyone else in here!  Kick his ass!Did you give the axe to Larry or Mark?Larry because I noticed Mark wasnt actually doing any work lol.Did you try to revive Larry?No he was dead due to his own temper.  My Lee was nice to everyone and helpful Larry put everyone at risk and was an asshole who would have done the same exact thing.How do you think things would have turned out if Larry had survived?Guy was a ticking timb bomb he would have had a heart attack eventually but his timing was so poor.  Lilly would not have snapped and killed Carley.    ,TheWalkingDeadGame,dc8e36m,2,t5_2tzww
10337667,0,t3_5nyj9b,oh thanks for posting! I hated this kid. Fucking commie I was a big fan of Kenny and I hated this kid right from the beginning just like he did. Weak nerd looking kid that speaks Communist and then you HAVE to shoot his sister and its not like hes ever going to forgive you. And then he ended up shooting me when the red head and black guy stole the truck! I hate him! Honestly the red head girl I see as siding with him shes betrayed me multiple times but the black guy seemed genuine. I wish I had the option to kill all three of them. ,TheWalkingDeadGame,dcftzo7,4,t5_2tzww

We will most likely be able to side with David over Clementine and Jesus Kate TrippEleanor sometimes but my guess is that we will ultimately abandon TNF or even fight against them. Similiar to how it was with Carvers camp. We were able to side with Carver sometimes but in the end we destroyed his camp and helped killing him.,TheWalkingDeadGame,dd6qbde,3,t5_2tzww

11209450,0,t3_5zcq58,Im hoping it gets much better than its started. At this point in the first two seasons I was already invested in the characters and excited for the next episode. I didnt even know that guys name who shot Mary Anna until I saw it on the forums I still dont remember him even being at the junk yard and his fight with Javier over that girl with  lines was almost the entirety of the PAX teaser. By this point in season  if you were bros with Kenny it was because you chose to be making decisions in his favor and helping him when given the option. In A New Frontier they kinda just tell you Tripps your boy now hes going to follow you without question. All I know about him is he seems to have extreme mood swings lol. Its the most disappointing release Ive bought in a while and I really didnt want it to be. I still hope it can recover.,TheWalkingDeadGame,df2ku1p,1,t5_2tzww

The same thing goes for Season s Badger.For Season  I hated Reggie. He was so badly written that he did so many stupid things. I wish that he had a better death scene overall.Honorable Mentions go to Jesus in Season  because I find the TV version of him way better. Then again I felt the reverse for Glenn. Also obligatory Fuck Arvo.,TheWalkingDeadGame,dfjgmmt,4,t5_2tzww

11369596,1,t3_625b0y,I apologize in advance because the topicthought of AJ literally gets me heated.I was hoping he was dead. I never cared for the kid and wish I was given the choice to continue alone. I even tried leaving him during the gun fight in S. Alas! It seems we are stuck with the little asshole as a plot device. I was seriously hoping not giving him the medicine would kill him or that we would see his fat little face bashed after turning. I just dont know why my Clementine cares so much for the little shit. Im looking at this Clementine and shes not the Clementine I knew and played. So Im disappointed with that aspect of the episode but everything else was good. Though if ANYONE dies trying to save that tiny fucker Im going to be pissed. Its the APOCALYPSE. Worry about YOU. A baby would seriously drag you down and cant offer anything to the situation. If it were ME in the situation  Id go ancient and get rid of him via exposure. Aint nobody got time for that! ,TheWalkingDeadGame,dfkpztp,-1,t5_2tzww

They add an annoying border around everything that doesnt have to be there........But it will get the job done though just the same as long as you dont run into technical problems.  Unless you have a best friend with a PC that will let you use it whenever I wouldnt be afraid of the iOS version if thats your only option.

No matter how difficult she finds him she still loves him like hes her own. Its really incredible that they managed to stay together for four years in the apocalypse. I didnt initially think Javi was all that interested in her I was afraid of what David would think even before the end of episode . From the flashbacks its pretty clear that theyre marriage was somewhat of a mismatch. I still feel a little bad about going behind Davids back but under the circumstances it shouldnt be unforgivable. Nor should it stop them from bringing down Joan and reuniting Clem with AJ together.,TheWalkingDeadGame,dgot2yy,3,t5_2tzww
