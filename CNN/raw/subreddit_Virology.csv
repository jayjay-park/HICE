8352738,0,t3_4tyrz3,It appears to be a pet term of the corresponding author Esteban Domingo. Its introduced in chapter  of a book he wrote published this year Theres no citation given in the book so I assume he invented it. Heres the explanation from the chapter gt Substitutions that serve a virus to increase its fitnessunder different environmental circumstances are termed joker substitutions. Joker substitutions inthe sense of the extra playing card in some games map at amino acid positions apt to affect positivelyone or more activities of one protein leading to a general increase in replication efficiency under differentenvironmental demands. Joker substitutions may compensate for fitness costs endured by the viruseven those due to malfunction of an unrelated viral proteinI dont foresee it gaining much popularity personally.,Virology,d5ln8m9,1,t5_2usj4

There is a big difference in doing genomics or proteomics and you need to decide where your interest is.Word of advice I looked for a PhD position where I would learn a multitude of different techniques which are also applicablewanted in industry. Because to be honest not everybody stays in academia and in industry it is about what you can do. One trick ponies can get out of fashion pretty quickly.,Virology,ddo6l15,2,t5_2usj4

11388349,0,t3_62gp4o,Welcome to the fun world of Zika. Im so glad the craze has died down. Honestly the easiest approach is to just make an infectious clone reporter. A few different groups have published their clone just pick one and throw a GFP or something in. Recheck the the lit a couple of the published ones are obligated to share reagents per journal guidelines cough Cell Host and Microbe. You can try to clone it yourself from scratch but its tricky I made an infectious clone myself several parts of Zika seem pretty toxic in ecoli even in low copy cloning vectors and it was annoying. Theres different ways it can all be done but honestly the reporter clone is going to be the easiest to do experiments on especially in high scale. Pop out a bunch of  well plates at a few MOIs and do a drug screen in house with a plate reader. Boom. ,Virology,dfmumlv,4,t5_2usj4
11388477,0,t1_dfmumlv,My lab tried contacting somebody who published an infectious clone reporter in cell host and microbe. It seems like he is not interested in sharing the clone since he also does screening for anti virals and thats what were doing at the moment. You wouldnt happen to have an infectious reporter clone would you? Thanks for replying. ,Virology,dfmv5i3,1,t5_2usj4
