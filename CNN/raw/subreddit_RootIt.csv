2474657,0,t1_cm33t3g,PhilZ is just CWM on steroids. it has all your basic cwm features and then some. I dont have an HTC phone so I dont know about helping the OP. But maybe you can now that you know Philz is cwm.EDIT OH NEVER MIND I KNOW WHAT TO DO.okay hook up your phone to your PC and then go into recovery. then go to mounts and storage and mount USB storage. assuming youre on windows itll take a moment to install drivers. at this point you might get a window allowing you to explore the contents of the internal storage. if so its all a matter of copypaste onto your phone. if not then download an allinone adb installer. install adb and the adb drivers for your phone. it should give you an option to install them all at once for basically every type of phone. then assuming you still have it connected with USB mounted in philz open a command prompt type cmd in your start menu and and then type adb devicesif you installed adb correctly it will start the daemon. if your phone is connected and with proper drivers itll return something along the lines ofdevicexxxxxx recoveryor HTCdevice blah blah  blahthen find out the directory for your backups on PC.say its on your desktopit would be CUsersyour usernameDesktopclockworkmodbackupsbackup folderif so type cd CUsersyour usernameDesktopclockworkmodbackupsthen type adb push ltname of backup folder heregt storagesdcardclockworkmodbackupsor sdcardor datamediaor sdcardwhatever the directory for your internal storage is. anyway make sure that the windows slashes are back slashes  and the android ones are forward slashes then restore your backups and youre good to goI hope I didnt miss anything ,RootIt,cmhkppd,1,t5_2zxvp
