2447165,0,t3_2njhkk,I decided a long time ago that before Im going to wait the full  weeks before telling our families. I havent completely decided yet how to announce it to my husband...Ill probably just scream and cry at him. For our families though I want to cross stitch their new titles onto articles of clothing and then wrap them and give them as gifts for no reason. For my facebook announcement Im either going to have my husband make a mini flash animation or Ill play off the whole me being a baker thing and go with a bun in the oven D ,FirstTimeTTC,cme6a10,1,t5_353sm
