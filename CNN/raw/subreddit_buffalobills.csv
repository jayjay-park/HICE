242922,0,t1_cf5wtoe,I will totally own up to being one of those people who were responding to reach accusations about the first pick with hes the on player they wanted above all else! But looking back over the past couple seasons I think its fair to say we have a problem in the scouting department. Dont get me wrong we had a great draft in spite of everything but I think there are one or more people in charge of figuring out whom the other teams intend to draft who I wouldnt feel bad if they began seeking a new job. They made a mistake when guessing when other QBs would be taken I dont think trading down into late first would have been a worse alternative and wasted a th round jumping up to take TJ Graham when we could have taken similar build and skillset TY Hilton without moving in addition to making a serious impact in our game against Indy. Not that I think we have an Andrew Luck on our roster but Im not favorable to these kinds of mistakes in early rounds that cost us picks.,buffalobills,cf5xisq,1,t5_2ra29

983460,0,t1_chg2evp,QB is far and away the most important position.  Youre right we spent a st round pick on a QB last year turns out we missed and didnt land a great QB.  So yes I would like to keep drafting QBs until you land one that can win you a Super Bowl.  Without a great QB it becomes extremely difficult to win a Super Bowl.  Also you have more than one draft pick in a year so its not like saying I want to draft QBs means I want to only draft QBs.  For example this year I think it would have been prudent to spend a rd or th or th round pick on a QB.  To me thats not mortgaging the future for chance to land a great QB.  However what is mortgaging the future is to give up multiple future picks to trade up a couple of spots and draft a WR a position which historically rookies have not excelled in.  Also a position which even the most elite players at that position do not greatly change the fortune of a team.,buffalobills,chg2so9,-6,t5_2ra29

1989957,0,t3_2hhqxt,Texans fan here and I know about half the sub was wondering when we were going to start Mallet after last week.  Some teams are more loyal than others.  Admittedly with Manuel I felt the Bills were a great team last year except for QB.  The moves you guys made over the offseason seemed unwise but it also showed commitment.  Its amazing what message a first round pick sends and the Bills have two.  First the ONLY QB in the first round was Manuel.  Then this year the Bills traded up to get him a new weapon.  For some context  rookie QBs performed wonderfully.  Even Weeden did as well as any Browns rookie QB.  The bar for rookie performance was unfairly raised.  Geno Smith drafted after Manuel was looking at competition from Vick after one year with shitty receivers and the FO actually had the balls to say they wanted Vick to compete for the job.  So Manuel isnt really being singled out with horrible treatment.,buffalobills,cksznef,4,t5_2ra29

Hes been inaccurate at times and had some poor reads but today was above and beyond bad.  Last week wasnt much better though.  First two games he was fine.  Point being he played like shit against a great D and the greatest defender in the league.  When the OLine also dropped a big one.  Thats not excusing his poor play but its partially explaining it.  Im not a proponent of mindlessly defending his play but Im sure as hell a big fan of saying wait and fucking see if this kid whos played less than a full season can show some improvement.

I think the only chance he will ever get to start again is at the end of the year if we are out of the playoffs OR ifwhen Orton goes down OR a new HC next year decides he didnt get a fair shake and start him again.So maybe he gets the chance to start again probably a higher chance than other similar QBs like Gabbert or Josh Freeman. But I think his chances of every recovering and making strides to be a starting quality QB are done. His confidence will be gone and the faith from the team will probably be beyond repair.

Will help keep Defenses from keying in on Orton he is a good QB but theres a reason why he is a Journeyman. Orton does seem to fit this system well though and he has that QB Swagger that our team has lacked since Fitz left and hadnt been around since Bledsoe many years before him. The Offense seems to have rallied behind his glorious Stache and showed the fight they were lacking the last few weeks. The wideouts actually fight for the ball and their alligator arms sprouted seemingly several feet almost overnight.

2334736,0,t3_2m263z,I mean theres a lot to like about him. Hes only  and he put up  yards from scrimmage in his second game dressing for us. The fumble didnt exactly help us but thats the sort of thing that happens to all players.

2336730,0,t1_cm0i2uq,Im not really blaming anyone in particular. Not even Bryce he thought he had a clear shot at the end zone but got caught from behind. It just wouldve been nice if Chandlers hands didnt turn to stone at the worst possible moment. My guess is that he was just jittery from the suddenness of it all.gt Every single time a fumble like that happens it pretty much ruins the rest of the game. For the Bills it is an extreme momentum changer.We will always have that one critical game where somebody turns the ball over at the worst possible moment. We may as well have it written into the schedule as a footnote its that much of a regular thing. Kansas City this year Atlanta last year Tennessee and New England the year before NY Giants the year before that...hell you need to go back to a season where they sucked so bad that none of the games had a chance to be critical. And they still had one game with a worstpossiblemoment turnover the game against the Ravens. Those games happen to every team once in awhile but with this sort of reliable pattern? Makes me wonder sometimes...,buffalobills,cm0j6ie,1,t5_2ra29

2359207,0,t3_2mdv1v,Belichick Reid Payton and the past Levy Walsh Gibbs all havehad systems that worked every time  of the time.  The system is as important as talent.  Thats why Belichick can bomb drafts and hit the bargain bin in free agency and still go  every year.Bills need to do whatever it takes to find the real deal who has a system that doesnt rely on top notch talent at all positions.  The draft should revolve around picking QBs until they strike gold.  Our WRs are not as good as the fanbase believes.  Theres Sammy and a bunch of wr s.  I liked the Marrone pick but he has shown hes not ready to be the guy.  He hit the jackpot with Pettine but doomed us all with a lazy OC pick.  How hard did he search for offensive minds before he decided his system that wasnt exactly lighting the Big East on fire was going to translate into the NFL?  On top of him being an oline guy coming into a team that had a line that opened holes for Freddie and Spiller and turning that same line into the second biggest weakness on the team.Any outside consultant will see the Hackett pick and declare it so bad it makes you question Marrones judgement on all else.  I suspect Schwartz  will be offered the HC position but OBD will pick the OC.  Goodwin from Arizona has done amazing things without stability at QB or franchise RBs.

We can do both. We SHOULD do both since theyll both improve the team. I think if you read the message transcripts with an open mind youll see evidence that Incognito was just a meathead a guy without a sense of tact who ran into a guy who was sensitive. Really youre advocating railroading him out of the league because he wrote that a teammate was a pussy? Look at their relationship  its quite clear that they were if not the best of friends at least friendly with each other. You can spin any relationship that way out of context. The best man at my wedding I choked until he was unconscious in college. He made cruel jokes about my late father. If you take those things in isolation we look like were being cruel to each other. But thats out of context and its not representative of our friendly relationship. Martin and Incognitos message transcript looks like two guys who are friendly with each other. Incognito was a dick  but seemed to be just a shit talker in a friendly relationship. When the Martin shit went down Incognitos messages rang true when he asked Martin what was up and if he was okay.

Do you think every star QB has good offensive coaching? And is it really Marrone or Hacketts fault that Manuel has horrendous accuracy that he cant read a defense presnap he cant anticipate an open WR he cant go throw his reads has poor footwork....Its because of these this and it has only gotten worse since his first game. We have a playoff team we cant let Manuel hold us back when we have a real opportunity here. Manuel is widely regarded a bust among every one you talk to except in rbuffalobills.The only argument i hear from proManuel supporters is he doesnt have enough experience or he was raw to begin with. This is backed by nothing by a flawed concept that experiencegrowth. In the NFL it is true with some but at least you see some signs of growth from  game to the last...Manuel has gotten worse from his st game to his last...I am not just looking at stats. You cant run an offense through this guy.Manuel is going to be down as our worst QB of the s...Worse than Losman worse than Edwards worse than AVP worse than Brohm.I get a lot of heat for my stance on Manuel. I understand. He was a first round pick and those who dont want to give up on him dont necessarily understand the variables that go into a successful QB.

3647290,0,t3_324a8d,Ive said this before but EJ has the ability to be a good QB in this league if he fixes his footwork. When he steps into his throws properly he throws a pretty good ball... But he has a tendency to throw off his back foot or step sideways instead of towards his target. Thats when he throws errant passes. Footwork has been an issue since he was in college and it continues to be an issue. Fix that problem first. After that then start to work on quicker and better reads. Of all of the young QBs the Bills have brought in in the past  years Manuel impresses me the most. Im not saying hes the next franchise QB that weve been looking for...

4592856,0,t3_3dx8jd,Colts is a push. I think they rely way too much on Andrew Luck so if you can shut down the pass you win that game. Could go either way though. Our defense going up against a strong passing team after having nothing but our three QBs to practice against could be rough. I think we sweep the Dolphins this year. Weve beaten them  out of the last  times and the one win they did have over us was when our offense was playing like shit on top of the refs handing out freebies towards them. I think theyve done a terrible job of building a team around Tannehil and they broke the bank on a player they really didnt need. Cowboys are also a push. They play better on the road and they got the good Oline. Theyre not gonna be playing as good of a defensive line as ours this season so theres the chance we could be pretty disruptive. I think that game is gonna come down to how our offense is shaping up at that point. ,buffalobills,ct9iua6,9,t5_2ra29

Other than the Chris Williams signing and the EJ Manuel pick still kinda up in the air but ya know  probably the best option in that QB class and they backed themselves into a we need to draft one corner there arent really any bad decisions on his part that really have been notable.

Their fans are relatively new since they only started showing up in ish and theyre unsure what to do with all their success in football and the other  big sports.

5835915,0,t1_cxkeghp,Our defense is nowhere close to as good as it was last season. Our corners have improved but our safeties are terrible although a lot of that has to do with Aaron Williams being hurt in my opinion. Our defensive line is nowhere near as dominant as it was last season in both the run and pass game and our linebackers have regressed hugely. Our defense is costing us just as many games as our offense maybe even more.  points against a Chiefs team that held their previous six opponents to under  points should be enough to win a game against a team without most of their starting line and their third string running back. Our offense is definitely better this and I dont see how you can argue that run game is unbelievably better as well as our offensive line play and if you think Tyrod isnt at least as good as EJ or Orton I think youre crazy. ,buffalobills,cxkm62n,1,t5_2ra29

Now I know that was hyperbole but regardless I think its clear that we have other receiving threats that can and have produced already on the roster.

He gets big runs that help the numbers and can lead to scores but he doesnt get the consistent yards that lead to easy first downs.  Tyrod is the same with the long balls.

7303524,0,t1_d28c6ts,The man is still allowed to have an opinion and express it. It doesnt automatically become a part of the Buffalo Bills brand. Owners donate money to different political candidates all the time players speak out for and against public officials all the time and the world spins on. No one thinks liberal when they see the Pats logo or conservative when they see the Jets logo. And yet their owners donate along those partisan lines. People are mature enough to understand that the world is nuanced and when someone of an organizationcommunity supports a given person or cause that organizationcommunity itself may not and likely does not entirely at least. The world is comprised of all sorts of people with all sorts of different opinions and theres no need to expect or aspire to complete conformity of consciousness. It just bogs us all down even further in this us vs them mentality and thats bad for the discourse and its bad for everybody.The only people are who bothered by a public figure like Rex expressing their political affiliation are the people who view politics as some sort of moral imperative. Likewise expressions of political leanings as some sort of virtuesignaling. Oh good hes on my side or Oh ew hes on their side Viewing political affiliation as some sort of moral absolute where it gauges what kind of person someone is is just disingenuous and steeped in closedmindedness. Having a healthy attitude about this stuff is recognizing that people have these opinions and they can be free to express them.Im saying this as a Bernie supporter. This whole debacle doesnt change what I think of Rex or the Bills or the players it doesnt change anything. Im not gonna be ashamed because my teams coach doesnt have a political opinion that I share. I dont think any less of him I like him same as I have not a popular opinion after last years D I guess which is fair damn it all if he isnt entertaining.Basically to reiterate what aaronjaymus said Seriously who gives a shit?,buffalobills,d28d0yl,2,t5_2ra29

8399215,0,t3_4ulvnm,Nobody really has touched on coaching here...Im  so I only remember as far back as Marv Levy who in my opinion was our last great coach.  Levy was an incredible motivator who was very bright. He has written several books and before that he would quote literature and military quotes to amp up the guys. He even wrote a fight song for the Bills. Hes beloved for a reason. Unfortunately those who criticize him say he wasnt much of an Xs and Os guy and thats why he got blown out in the super bowls aside for SB .  Next came son of Bum Wade Phillips who was a very good even great defensive coordinator and is famous for not wearing a headset on the sidelines. We were last successful under him going to the playoffs in  and losing due to the Music City Throw Forward. His downfall was having to give way to Ralph Wilsons wishes to start Rob Johnson over Doug Flutie in that playoff game. Wilson preferred Johnson over Flutie because of the financial investment in Johnson.  the next ten years or so are kind of hazy because I was in college and drunk often. The s were very forgettable.  Im not sure of the order but I think next was Gregg with two Gs Williams whom was an asshole and a worse coach. Had a very punchable face.  Then came Mike Malarkey who actually quit on the Bills rather than fulfill his contract. We nearly went to the playoffs with him but lost to the Steelers second and third stringers in the last game of the season. Probably my least favorite coach was Skeletor AKA Richard Jauron. Dick Jauron perfected the golf clap. He coached not to lose. Bend but dont break. God I hated him. Sure he had lousy QB play but he had some decent defenses and  years were the norm. He was the definition  of mediocre. We then had Chan Gailey for a while who had a soft spot in my heart. Hes a tremendous o coordinator. You know theres a trend here...the Bills enjoy employing tremendous coordinators that cant seem to make the jump to great coach. Gailey did tremendous things with the offense doing a lot with far less talent. He made Ryan Fitzpatrick relevant. Unfortunately his downfall was not paying  attention to the defense and hiring terrible coordinators. And I think he was burned out by the time he got here.  the next guy I dont want to talk about him because he can go fuck himself. now we have Rex who is a tremendous d coordinator but hasnt proven himself as a good head coach. TLDR ever since Marv Levy Buffalo struggled finding head coaches hoping that offensive and defensive coordinators would make the jump to be successful head coaches. ,buffalobills,d5rg5iu,6,t5_2ra29

9302474,0,t1_d8v49qf,Why would I be insulted? Kneeling is still a respectful gesture. When youre playing peewee or little league or whatever and someone gets hurt what does everyone do? Takes a knee. Its not like hes listening to headphones sitting on the bench and chit chatting with other players or flipping off the flag the whole time. Hes solemnly kneeling and looking down. Furthermore I cant think of many things more American than someone using a position of notoriety they worked their ass off to reach as a chance to bring attention to serious issue that needs addressing. Especially when it means they will get all sorts of negative attention. And maybe if you dont want people to think youre a racist you shouldnt hitch your wagon to a group that uses vitriolic hate to attack a black man for peacefully protesting against the unfair brutality levied against his race at the hands of those that are supposed to protect. Im not saying that all or even anything more than a small chunk of the people who are upset about what Kaepernick is doing are racist. But rather that many racists are complaining very vocally and hating Kaepernick for his actions. Its not exactly a great group to be associated with. Everyone who is so hurt by his actions should probably take a moment to think about why he and many others feel they must make this protest. They are protesting symbols of this nation because they do not feel everyone is receiving fair and equal treatment in it. And they can make a very compelling argument. It doesnt matter if as youve stated over and over again he was raised by white people. He can still be upset about the treatment of blacks by police. And actually you implying that he was raised white and therefore shouldnt be able to care about this is pretty fucked up. That does actually make you seem racist. ,buffalobills,d8v5mln,9,t5_2ra29

9388567,0,t3_5969qk,Priority PositionsSafety  even if we could depend on Aaron Williams health we cant this needs to be upgraded.  Graham is acceptable but getting older and we could use another game changer back there.  Preferably an actual safety with good coverage and not one of those new hybrid SLBs.WR  I like Woods.  I think hes underrated by Bills fans and he can most certainly fill the dependable  WR role.  That said hes in the last year of his contract and we need to draft his replacement because I dont think we have the cap flexibility to spend money on a  WR.  That cap space will likely be going to Gilmore Zach Brown and Lorenzo Alexander though Alexander will likely be on an affordable Manny Lawson type deal.  Clemson WR Mike Williams would be a good target.DL  Kyle Williams is still playing at a high level but hes old.  If we were fortunate enough to be in position to take a great prospect like Alabama DE Jonathan Allen we should take the opportunity even if Williams would be around for another couple of years.  With the way our line rotates Allen would still see a lot of playing time until he became the full time successor of Kyle Williams.  Our line would then presumably be Allen  Dareus  Washington and set for quite a while.  Wed also be able to play out of more traditional  base sets.Quarterback  I liked Tyrod in year  but am less than happy with the lack of progression in year .  If we find ourselves in position to take a Derek Carr  Andy Dalton  Teddy Bridgewater type at the tail end of the first or beginning of the nd we should jump on that opportunity.Secondary ConcernsRT  Who knows if Henderson will come back to the level of play he was at before.  Cyrus doesnt seem to be a fit on the right side and Mills seems average at best.  Supposedly this year isnt talent laden at OT.LG  It would be nice to get Richies successor before hes needed so that he can learn on the bench for a year or two.NT  even if Dareus shows that he can be depended upon after this years bullshit we still need a legitimate backup NT.  We should be scouring all the big and small schools for anyone that shows promise in the thth rounds.RB  keep scouring the later rounds for more high potential guys like Karlos Williams assuming Jonathan Williams doesnt show anything in the back half of the season.  A big bruiser like Pitts James Connor would be interesting.,buffalobills,d962fgx,6,t5_2ra29

When the majority of the team loses faith as soon as they did no one will play well especially the QB. That being said Tyrod hasnt been amazing this year and I totally he isnt always accurate or doesnt make correct reads but still I think we should pay him for next year give sometime for the team to develop and decide at the end of next season.

You put him on a list of players we have that are potential stars drafted by Whaley and Im saying he isnt even on the team anymore  and it shouldnt be that surprising that he isnt considering his predraft history. Whaley took a gamble on a low character guy and got burned. In my opinion the Bills would be better served putting a premium on character and intelligence in the next  drafts in an effort to change the overall culture.  Im not all that frustrated about Karlos considering it opened the door for Gilly.  I am a total bitch and am excited that Ive earned a tag whatever that is.Your  list is a fucking joke.   players werent drafted by Whaley.  are not on the team.  are rookies one of which didnt play a snap and the other two didnt exactly flash yet.

11714272,0,t3_674zlr,Not sure what the trade down in the nd round netted us but it looks like two extra fifths? Seems really awful if true. Plus if we are looking to trade we might as well have traded down in the first with the two top WRs still on the board. Still I will try to judge based on what we could have had based on the picks. st  Love this pick. I hope we get Corey Davis I think he is going to be a superstar and one of the best players in the draft. nd  Dont mind Marcus Williams but if we had to go safety I would rather have Desmond King. Beyond that I would have rather us picked Adoree Jackson. Hes going to be a good corner. Think he gets taken at the end of the first. Also if we dont trade down I would have liked to of had Dalvin Cook. I know I am going to get flamed for that but hes a first round talent and I dont think you pass on someone like that in the second. Basically Im saying my idea would have been  stay put and draft cook  trade down and take Adoree Jackson  trade down and take Desmond King. Im not even angry at this pick though. rd  I like Duke Riley here and I dont mind the draft of WRSLB and again I will get flamed here but I would have taken JuJu SmithSchuster. Hes a great wide receiver and again hes never going to fall this far. I guess I would rebuilding the offense with how this draft shook out. th  I like the first two picks but I would change the last two. Jordan Sterns becomes Conor McDermott and Steven Taylor becomes Chad Kelly. th  I have no clue how Ejuan Price is still hanging around but I am swapping him out for Keionta Davis immediately. Price is a great player and I dont imagine him being here in the th.So based on your draft and I wont stick at our spot in the nd I gotWR  Corey DavisCB  Adoree Jackson WR  JuJu SmithSchuster CB  Jalen MyrickOT  Will HoldenOT  Conor McDermottQB  Chad Kelly DE  Ejuan PriceYes I missed a safety but I think I came out vastly improving this team. We have an almost WR in Davis. He will be great as a  and a backup if we move on from Sammy. If Sammy stays healthy we have a very very amazing wr corps going forward. I think Adoree Jackson has a great year as our CB. Then we have Juju coming out of the slot. Again if we decide to keep Sammy we have a great WR corps. Maybe one of the best in the game. That would give Tyrod or our Rookie QB next year a great headstart. Beyond that I got us a project QB and I think a rusher in price who could get us  sacks a year and a few tackles to try at RT. Oh and if Im staying put in the second and this will get me a lot of hate I am getting Corey Davis Dalvin Cook and Juju SmithSchuster. I know no defense in such a defensive heavy draft but when you get three first rounders Juju might go early nd I would call that a win. ,buffalobills,dgnubkk,12,t5_2ra29

11730378,0,t1_dgp7t8f,The team has to designate what type of tender it is when they make it. A tender is basically a one year deal to an RFA that the player can choose to sign or not sign. A first round tender is worth more money than a nd round tender and so on. A player might choose not to sign the tender to hold out for a longer term contract or to hope for an offer sheet. Another team can sign the player to an offer sheet which in theory is a more desirable contract than the tender. The original team can choose to match or not. If they match they keep the player on that contract. If not the nd team yields their next draft pick equivalent to the value of the tender to the st team. So a more valuable tender reduces the chances of an offer sheet but is more expensive if the player actually signs it. Sometimes a team might secretly covet picks more than the player in question and deliberately attract an offer sheet. ,buffalobills,dgpo36m,1,t5_2ra29

11778863,0,t1_dguuqux,Wow guess I shouldnt be commenting about the draft in the official draft thread. No one even has a counter argument just mad at me. Great.This team has fielded a defense with TWO first round CBs TWICE since the drought with absolutely nothing to show for it. Madness. You cant even do an average draft position for the PFF top CBs because so many of them were undrafted. Including  of the top . Id love one person to at least attempt a discussion. ,buffalobills,dgv66r6,0,t5_2ra29

11782044,0,t1_dguzy9y,He is the most consistent CB in the draft of this year.  Hes extremely reliable in both zone and man knows how to play the ball isnt afraid to try and break up passes and is an amazing leader something McDermott wanted in this draft.  All in all this kid is going to be a nightmare for opposing WRs if he stays on the right track.  Amazing pick by Buffalo also getting a first round next year alongside the rd round pick am loving this pick already.,buffalobills,dgvj6u2,1,t5_2ra29

11792901,0,t1_dgwo80x,Agreed. Im not totally opposed to giving Kelly a shot but McDermott clearly values ethics almost as much as talent. No way he uses a draft pick on him especially when there is more pressing needs. ,buffalobills,dgwrjyj,2,t5_2ra29
11793937,0,t1_dgwmb3k,That may have been me. My point is that you cant evaluate the move itself by the outcome when were talking about a freak injury that happened in the pros. ,buffalobills,dgwvs7v,3,t5_2ra29

11807602,0,t1_dgyf89l,exactly what i mean..Dak was a mid draft pick that EVERY TEAM psssed on as well as the bills. to even bring him up now with your hindsight glasses on is incredibly unfair..this is the kind of stupidity im talking about with this fanbase. ,buffalobills,dgyfl2h,0,t5_2ra29
