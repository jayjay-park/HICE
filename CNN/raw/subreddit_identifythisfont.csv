406704,0,t1_cfmwycd,Usually with etchings and lithographs theyll use a stencil but with this being etched in the early s he couldve done it by hand. I have a feeling the elongated leg stroke on the R is what will separate this typeface from others. The two Rs have different strokes though which may be a product of the way it was printed like how most of the As have ink in the closed sections.

7018511,0,t3_4bs0m4,Ive had situations like this where I had something that was either custom or started with a font but then got heavily customized.Hate to say it the best way I found to handle these situation is to simply place the image in illustrator ctrl to lock it type the words in a font thats in the same style the style here is slab serif and then convert those letters to outlines... and finally lay them on top of the logo and tweak them to match it. If you are good with your white arrow selection tool and you will find its much faster to tweak the letters of an existing font than the redraw each letter from scratch with the pen tool. The trick is to start with an existing font thats close enough. For this logo thats a tall order. Fonts that come to mind are Aachen Giza Clarendon extra bold. Youll probably have to draw the S and R. I could be wrong and someone knows of a single font that matches all these letters but to me it looks like at least  fonts possibly with extra boldness added and maybe just done entirely custom.,identifythisfont,d1bwbfz,2,t5_2sl6p
