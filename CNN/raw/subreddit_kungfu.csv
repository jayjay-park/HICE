68878,0,t3_1uvruv,When I was a kid I wanted to learn kung fu after being exposed to Chinese soap operas which my mom would watch every day. The soaps were set in ancient China and there was a lot of Bejing operastyle acrobatics fight choreography and real physical skill combined with fantastical elements like flying through the air visible energy and the like. I desperately wanted those skills and powers to be real even more so because I would get in schoolyard scraps from time to time.Fast forward several decades when I started with  Star Praying Mantis. My motivations had changed to getting fit after years of a sedentary job and lifestyle and to maybe pick up some fighting skill as well even though my chances of getting into a fistfight were now close to zero. I wanted a traditional Chinese martial art and school given my heritage and I wanted to toughen up my body and see how far I could push myself even given the limitations of my time with work family and life. I continue now for those same reasons and because I have seen the benefits kung fu has had in my life. I am stronger faster more coordinated and in better health than I have been since graduating from college. And I still enjoy delving deeper and deeper into the different layers of the art realizing with each class that there is more to even the most basic of movements than Ive learned so far. My plan my hope is that I will continue to practice kung fu on into the horizon. ,kungfu,cem9ris,7,t5_2qvwm

Older sister makes this even more challenging because girls start to mature before boys and their developing coordination has the risk of the little brother giving up if the sis learns easily things that are hard for him.Learning proper exercise behaviour does however add a lot to train for the young ones. If you havent done so already the benefit of the possible group pressure may also help to add small rituals using the word very freely on starting and ending the exercise which serve three purposes First increase the feeling of safety and familiarity by providing clear markers when the exercise starts and stops. Second practical things like warmup or cleaning after oneself say putting the map away together in your case. Third to teach the social norms of the context.

They knew people turned on when they were born and turned off when they died but they did not know why.Later the phrase developed into a life specific thing that you were born with. Everyone had a given amount of chi and when it ran out you died.

Personally Id encourage you getting the foundation first with a local teacher then going on a retreat just because Id think youd get more out of it but at the end of the day a martial arts retreat is still a martial arts retreat. My guess is that the school you are looking at is a school set up for tourists. Not necessarily a tourist trap but definitely a place catering to westerners wanting to go learn kung fu in China. So long as the instructor has a reputation for being good that people outside of the schools influence attest to the instruction should be decent.It sounds fun could definitely be very cool I mean its a kung fu vacation in china sweet shit right? lol but its not like its absolutely needed to learn the art. The main thing you should do for learning Bagua is find a local teacher and train.  month immersion is cool but training  days a week every week for  years is how youre really going to learn it.If you do decide to go though have fun it sounds like a great time!,kungfu,cop12ox,3,t5_2qvwm

6297961,0,t3_41v6jk,chineselongsword.com has the most practical translations Ive seen of old manuals and the video demonstrations correctly display a lot of the information.Regarding the General Qis chapter on boxing all of the techniques are those commonly found in northern style Shaolin CMA Single whip Diagonal movement etc. So if you practice an authentic longfist or Shaolin style you probably already know these techniques though the naming might be different.What is important though is that General Qi wrote in a poetic way not to describe individual techniques but to describe strategy and tactics. General Qis soldiers would train these techniques in line drills not in forms. It is only when these techniques are mentioned in Korean manuals do they appear as forms. The website you mentioned has some videos of modern Korean practitioners practicing the techniques as pairs which is pretty cool. There are some in China that practice the techniques as a continuous solo form which is interesting I guess but typically those groups in China arent interested at all in combat application.If you want to train in historical Mingera Chinese martial arts first you must train with practice weapons of similar size and model. Military spears were  to  feet long and infantry swords were similar to either the miaodao or japanese katana.

7094045,0,t3_4cq0s3,Shi He Quan Hunting Crane originally had no weapons forms but now we have a staff form. It was created by my shifu because he had a student who needed to enter a competition in order to help boost his score for getting into a better school I think the student was in high school at the time trying to get into a good college. This is in Taiwan. Well to compete in the tournament you had to first perform a form as well as a weapons demonstration. But SHQ doesnt have weapons forms but my shifu had learned some staff basics from his father who had learned from a local staff master not sure what style but uses a heavy firm staff like a bo staff so he took those basics and taught them to the student then had the student just fake a form demonstration during the competition. These demonstrations were not graded but were requirements to qualify for the sparring tournament. So thats how Shi He Quan came to have a staff form. Later my shifu actually created a set form which is simple and comprised of the six basic moves.That student btw won the tournament and that too is an interesting story. The point system of the tournament was like this  points for a strike with hands or feet  points for throwing or moving the opponent out of the fight circlearea  points for a takedowngetting the opponent on the ground. Problem is its not  points for each strike. From the time the fight starts to when the ref separates you briefly to reset you can hit your opponent  time or  times you still just get  points.So this makes striking not a good strategy so almost everyone goes for throws and takedowns. They just go to grab you and get you down since thats the best way to score points. They wore headgear but no body protection.Seeing this my shifu told the student to just hit the guy in the chest over and over dont do anything else. Looking at the opponent my shifu figured he couldnt take many strikes like that since he was skinny and the gloves they wore were thin so hed feel the bone on bone contact. Going for a head strike wouldnt be as good since he head headgear.So instead of going for a takedown the student just went to thre body over and over. Eventually his opponent went down and didnt get back up so he got the KO. Funny part is this tournament was all just to get a better score to use to get into a better school and this was a county tournament. There was another national one anyone could participate. Because of the habit of going for takedowns no one was used to the ferocity of the sternum strikes so the other competitors all forfeited rather than face the student. Therefore the student won the tournament and obtained his goal.Theres a video of this fight My classmate is the guy on the left with the red headgear.,kungfu,d1kh9l1,3,t5_2qvwm

7494794,0,t3_4i0niz,gt Even so many people are under the impression that gong fu makes it able for a physically weaker combatant to defeat a stronger one. Thoughts?The hard reality is that to a certain point strength trumps everything. At their core all martial arts are intended to help physically weaker combatants defeat stronger ones. The goal is to overcome strength gaps with technique.The challenge and the need for weight classes is that if two people of near skill level meet the initial advantage goes to the stronger one.Given that combat sports are about in general matching skill against skill heavier weights will have the advantage.gt Im not saying its impossible to defeat a stronger person merely that there isnt a style that can consistently achieve the desired results except maybe for ground fighting styles.Without a doubt ground fighting styles and throwing styles are probably the best at quickly overcoming a weight difference when fighting a less skilled but significantly stronger opponent. But honestly I wouldnt count out boxing western or Chinese provided that they utilized a training methodology that worked against progressive resistance. ,kungfu,d2u49rr,1,t5_2qvwm

But to bring things back to reality and also tie into your post about courage strength and gong fu I think stop wishing to be a gorilla if you are not one. They have their own shortcomings to work with. We train with what we have and our confidenceinnerstrength  will be higher than if we wish to be something else. not to mention dreaming of gorillas takes your focus off of your own training....also just now thinking there is probably no gorilla style Kung Fu form because gorillas dont need a style.

7853958,0,t1_d3ydsur,That is a legit question. There are legit lineages in Henan especially in the Dengfeng area which can be traced directly to practices in the Shaolin Temple at various times. There are monks at the Shaolin Temple that are well trained in this material but they are largely overshadowed by the performance wushu that most people think of when they watch the Shaolin performances. Xiaohongquan dahongquan Paoquan tongbiquan etc that you see at a lot of schools in Dengfeng all come from these legitimate sources but are often lacking in the supplementary drills that make those styles come alive. In fact what many people see as dahongquan is actually the first form of many in a singular style called dahongquan. Its really difficult to make any sense of the situation in Dengfeng unless youve been there awhile. Also keep in mind that nothing truly originated at Shaolin...most of what was practiced there can all be grouped under a broad term called hongquan. Of course some of this can be debated and I would love to learn more.Then you have lineages that broke away from Shaolinassociated styles long ago but still bear the same telltale vocabulary and principles. Even though I never learned the shaolin changquan of Gu Ru Zhang I can tell by the movements and the lyrics that the style falls right in with the traditional styles in Dengfeng. There is a lineage called Kanjia that is remarkably similar. Finally you have the Shaolin inspired arts. In Japan there is Shorinji kenpo which the founder named in honor of the Shaolin Temple. Any Shorinji player Ive met were clear that their techniques dont come directly from Shaolin. I dont really have problem with this but it does give some people the wrong impression.Of course it is much easier to say what isnt Shaolin or even CMA. Demascos kenpo is not either of those.,kungfu,d3yut2e,3,t5_2qvwm

At best it has some Chinese influence along with other stuff. Youre probably not going to learn about Chinese culture but then again that is a problem that exists in TCMA schools too.

8639577,0,t3_4y59lo,I think that people should spar and and hard at that. But when people who have never fought with a learned martial art try to spar they often will resort to brawling and that will be what they are improving not their kung fu. I would assume that this is largely because it takes much longer to learn than most people give credit so maybe sparring should be introduced slowly and have it increase intensity as students develop.  ,kungfu,d6lk0zk,2,t5_2qvwm

8927674,0,t1_d7kfd1g,gt In your opinion can buddhism be studied without a temple or master?It depends on how far you want to take it. To reach enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings? One needs a teacher connected through a Vinaya lineage extending back to Sakyamuni Buddha himself. But to do as much in this life as one can with the resolve of awakening in future lives? Then sure study on your own is acceptable although a good teacher is invaluable all the same. The Buddhas teachings are complex requiring a high calibre of logical capacity and intellect to understand they are very easy to misunderstand and to take away the wrong teaching. So it also depends from where you are doing your personal study. Are you reading the works of former masters connected to the Vinaya who have the authority to teach Dharma? Are you reading the scriptures themselves? The commentaries from great philosophers like Asanga or Vasubandhu? Or are you reading more generic work? The latter is less useful. As in martial arts so too in Buddhism lineage is everything. Otherwise it is not to be trusted. If you are not connected to that lineage how can you trust what your own mind comes to as conclusion? If you respect lineage then you will approach study in the manner most advantageous. Only ego says I can do this on my own. Even the Buddha relied on teachers though he later discovered they did not teach the Way. And in his previous lives he studied under numerous previous Buddhas and bodhisattvas.gt I do consider myself buddhist but also TaoistThe two are very complementary although eventually differences do emerge. Still my last breakthroughs came from contemplating Taoist concepts despite being devoted to Buddhism.gt I believe in self as a vehicle to finding truth feeling that we are already equipped with the knowledge of understanding from past lives as well and guided by the spirits of our ancestors and mastersThe knowledge of understanding... to what end? The purpose of attaining Buddhahood is to establish the dharma in a time when the dharma has been forgotten in order to liberate countless sentient beings from suffering. I cannot argue that we are equipped with everything to navigate through this life peacefully from what we have accrued in previous lives but navigating this life is not the goal. For Buddhists training as bodhisattvas the only reason this life has manifested is in order for us to train in the dharma to cultivate tremendous stores of karmic merit to subdue and master our minds and realize the true nature of reality... so that we can return in the future a fully realized Buddha and be the Lantern for the World. So I think this greatly depends on your goals. Happiness in this life? No problemdo whatever you want. But happiness is easy. Personal suffering is easy to be liberated fromit simply takes discipline ethical conduct mindfulness and meditationbut the awakening of a Buddha is very rare. Thousands and thousands of eons pass between each Buddha. And if you are truly and honestly alive in this moment to alleviate the suffering of all other sentient beings then do you really think you can do enough in this life on your own to merit the attainment of Buddhahood in the future?If that is not your goal for now then it is not your goal and it is fine. A good Buddhist at the minimum supports the sangha community of monks through donations gives offerings of incense fruit clear water prayers prostrations to the Buddhas to the ancestors to all wandering ghosts or demons in order to alleviate their suffering... and that alone is fine enough. You are fortunate to have been touched by the Dharma at all in this life. Undoubtedly even if it has not happened now the resolve to attain awakening for the sake of all sentient beings will arise when the conditions have been cultivated in a future lifetime.,kungfu,d7kz3vu,1,t5_2qvwm

9235074,0,t1_d8ldkoj,Photos here.  I got photos of almost all the performances from our students.Collectively we did quite well...my Sije and Sihing were the Northern Womens and Mens Grand Champions respectively so that was really exciting.  I opened a school about a year ago and a couple of my students competed and did well so that was very rewarding.Personally I did not do too hot.  I got first in sparring which is nice but it was only one match.  One of my few complaints about the ICMAC is the lack of emphasis on sparring they did not even post the results online.  I didnt place for weapons unfortunately.  I DID manage to bag a bronze medal in empty hand forms which I was actually quite excited about because Im not naturally good at forms I had to practice a lot and the division was really competitive.One of my favorite things about the ICMAC is how friendly it is and this year was no exception.  Everyone I talked to was super friendly and really excited about Kung Fu including the guy I sparred no hard feelings at all.  There was a new school there I hadnt met before The Wushu Taekwondo Academy from NJ and they were really nice.  The whole things was a very positive experience.Five stars on Yelp will definitely return,kungfu,d8mm36o,2,t5_2qvwm

Tuesdays and Thursdays you have the option of working on either internal or external forms and exercises usually followed by push hands or another such practice Wednesday we work on our general curriculum usually forms and Friday is a full body workout followed by sparring. you can actually spar any day of the week Friday is just fight day.

10408449,0,t3_5p233l,So you want to train at home alone without a teacher using online resources like videos?    Im going to have to strongly advise against that. Every martial art requires you to have a partner at some point because fighting is fundamentally an activity that involves more than one person. At least one person should be experienced too otherwise unnecessary injuries will happen and that is very very bad.    In particular Wing Chun is a trappingfocused style which means a lot of it only works if you have strong sensitivity in contact with an opponent. That sensitivity is only going to develop if you work with another human being who knows what theyre doing.

But basically the only chance I had was to parry the stick and while the pole was retreating I would grab the pole before it could come back to counter.Merely parrying without pinning the staff usually resulted in being poked by a stick while I tried to close the gap.The pole user has so many options he can feint he can jab high and low when you get close he can bring the point closer. Whe you try to flank him it is much easier for him to present his point to you with less effort.
