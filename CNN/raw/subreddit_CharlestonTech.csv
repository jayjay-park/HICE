4629490,0,t3_3diibs,hey there currently work in infosecappsec ...i do application pen testing. If youre not wanting to spend thousands on a grad school type program Penn St or UMUC online or a stupid expensive certification SANS certs or even something like a CISSP there are a lot of good freeinexpensive options. Ive seen some listed in this thread.. This is specifically for web app but  this is the full version of the web application hackers handbook. This is a great source.. Kali and WebGoat. Download and get familiar w Kali if youre into web apps learn how to use Burp suite too. Download WebGoat  Get that set up and do the exercises. Other good ones similar to webgoat are Damn vulnerable web app and Mutillidae.Also and this one isnt free but Offensive Security  has a great certificationcourse offering called the OSCP. You sign up for the course called Pentesting with Kali and after you go through the course material and labs you take a live practical exam as in they give you a system online live for  hours and say go hack it its passfail. Ive yet to do this but Im going to start in October...once I move down to Charleston and get settled moving next month. I hear nothing but great things about it and know its a great learning experience. Not as expensive as some other certs either.Lastly sites like cybrary.it and pentesterlabs.com are great. Feel free to hit me up with any questions.,CharlestonTech,cte49mi,2,t5_32xi9
