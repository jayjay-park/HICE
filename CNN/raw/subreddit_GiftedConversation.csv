9729885,0,t3_5dkxzu,In elementary school we had one day a week where those few of us in the gifted program were taken to another school to have class.  It was great but limited.  We occasionally had interesting and locally famousimportant people come give talks and demonstrations.Once I got into junior high we met maybe a handful of times the entire time I was there.  In high school it was nonexistent.,GiftedConversation,dacf5xw,3,t5_3hked

I would imagine there are correlations where gifted individuals are more likely to view sexuality with an open mind and address any  internal struggles with sexuality rather than suppressing them. ,GiftedConversation,ddngnur,3,t5_3hked

11249249,0,t1_df6ylq7,Okay I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING ELSE TO ADD.I have met people who I can talk with intellectually and as well have a lot more in common with but generally a lot of them are from way better off backgrounds and were generally at least middle class growing up if not up and thats often sort of been what my issue has been even when I was growing up. But I was never quite conservative I never wanted to just go to school and get a regular job plus again my family was all so blue collar I was never exposed to cities to work outside of that. I just knew what the country was like and stuff.It took traveling a bit and just spending time living in cities to really get a grasp of how life was in those places and what kind of jobs there were and how people lived enjoyed culture. But thats the thing I almost went through borderline homelesssness because I could not find a decent place to live or people would have nothing to do or associate with me because again I wasnt just studying a random subject in school I was scared of the debt and I had no idea what to do. I was asked one time if I grew up under a rock and it was practically true. I did sort of but I never had anyone trying to steer me in the right direction either that or they just expected me to follow along because it worked for them.I never had a chance to go at my own pace and figure things out because I was always met by basically the enforcers they were like Agent Smith of the Matrix and were always trying to get me to conform or something or face the consequences of my actions and its always sort of been that way. At least its really bad for that in British Columbia. I tried living in Montreal for a short while and it was the only place that I felt was understanding tolerant and had a real artculture scene. So I am moving there soon so I can actually go to school or whatever and live on my own since apartments arent so expensive and its not gentrified like the rest of Canada. I used to live with people because rent was so expensive and it was just a nightmare this is where a lot of my bad experiences were from. I just experienced that no matter what I did most people could literally not understand me or get what I was about. I wasnt you know vaguely sort of helping the economy GPD or whatever it is in most peoples minds. Im sure mostly just Consume and obsessively work at your job. sigh I mean I even tried going back to college and upgrading but this one guy didnt get it that I lived with. Hed come up to me all of the time and yell DRINK DRINK BEER because he drank all of the time and partied and then hed tell me like so many other people i have none my whole life that I didnt do anything and he always asked me what I DID and it was just maddening. I was only able to recently find a website that lets you look at peoples credentials for jobs because just taking random courses in college seemed absurd because of the prices. I also just had no idea what I would like to do and had too many issues. Still with the price I am amazed how many people expect you to just go to school and consume whilst everyone else consumes. I hate it so much. When I lived in Vancouver BC. I just got so fed up with the way it is there I started acting really weirdly in public on purpose. One time I ran away from a huge crowd of people in public and yelled zombies zombies and it only made people hate me more but they already hated me so whatever. ,GiftedConversation,df733oy,2,t5_3hked
11279258,0,t3_60dlri,I dont have too much to add mainly because Ive been fortunate to have been accepted for who I am by my family all throughout my life. They didnt know I was gifted they were just good parents However I wanted to chime in by saying. Its definitely common for gifted people to be misunderstood and even labelled as dysfunctional by people at a surface level especially from my experience if theres a history of the gifted person not being accepted and appreciated during their childhood or by some peers at least to validate their identity  I strongly believe that a healthy childhood would train people like us to channel our energy in an efficient way that doesnt compromise who we are but also doesnt unnecessarily misrepresent who we are when we communicate that with others. NOT saying its your fault or anything being gifted isnt something that comes with a handbook but some people definitely dont have it in them to understand us and thats that.. I think theres a lot of truth to the cultural aspect of it. I grew up in Asia for all of my childhood born into an Asian family that was luckily for me very encouraging of my learning and complex thinking and I moved to Europe for  years of my adolescence before I came back to Asia. I had never felt more alienated and screwed up than I did during my adolescent years because I always sensed a much stronger antiintellectual culture. There was a huge huge culture of rewarding achievement in both places but Ive noticed that intelligence and curiosity has a strong place among Asian peers and its positively looked upon to have deep conversations  debates  be driven. Of course not everyone is like that but its easy to thrive here once you find your peers and I found it very different in the West those years really hurt me.I hope I was useful in some way of course as you mentioned a persons socioeconomic background perhaps plays a much bigger role in all of this as well,GiftedConversation,dfahk3t,2,t5_3hked
