1671506,0,t3_2dfq5e,To my knowledge there isnt an easy way to determine what is really above the fold page speed really recommends this because of a perceived performance boost.Id recommend copying something very basic like a minheight and backgroundcolor declaration from your primary navigation out of your CSS and putting it in the header to allow for this perceived performance while your CSS amp JS are downloading. There is a great article by the guardian newspaper about how they did this but the link eludes me but Ill try and find it on my way to work today.I might be wrong but by reading your post it seems like you can bump up your score by concatenating and minifying your CSS amp JS moving the JS to the footer and adding an async attribute to the script tag but I have no idea how your project is set up so this might cause a few issues in your case.To quickly concatminify your CSS amp JS I would recommend a looking into a build tool to do this for you such as Grunt or Gulp. I personally use Grunt for this sort of thing more specifically the grunt task gruntconcat will help you with this. Grunt also has an UnCSS plugin that will help you strip out unused CSS too but be wary of it as it can remove things like state classes and can cause issues.On a side note I want to write a grunt task that will allow you to split out some CSS an put it into the header automatically but havent had the time yet. Hope this makes sense still having the first coffee of the day.,web_dev,cjpusro,1,t5_2qs21
3232255,0,t1_cox0jif,I finally got the older version also slightly newer than what the site said and installed the Apple Updater. After the updater reported a new version of its self and I updated it it also reported a new version of Safari.Anyway this is still kind of bullshit because my site looks totally broken in Safari for Windows but theres just a single bug in Safari for OS X so it didnt really help because I wont support Safari for Windows.,web_dev,cox11rx,1,t5_2qs21
3699196,0,t1_cqd8pqb,We charge  USD for a single hour but we very seldom do a single hour of work. We typically charge between  and hr. It really depends on the complexity of the project.With a single hour of work we have to set up the same invoicing as  or  hours. The thing to keep in mind is that we arent set up like a freelancer would be.With that being said hr is more than fair. ,web_dev,cqdxlk7,1,t5_2qs21
5199315,0,t3_3jsw7s,Absolute is position fixed on the screen in regards to the browser. Relative positioning is where an element is position in relation to another.For instance lets say you had a DIV that was positioned px from the left and you had a DIV inside of that one that was relatively positioned px from the left. That second DIV will always be px from the left within the first DIV regardless of where it is.I believe position by default is relative. If you want to provide space around an element you should use the margin property or specifically in your case a margintop property.I rarely see absolute position being used unless it was a stationary navigation or side menu. Good luck!,web_dev,cvcplfk,0,t5_2qs21
