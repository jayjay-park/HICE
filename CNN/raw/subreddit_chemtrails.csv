3427000,0,t1_cpiqf6j,gt I cant provide anything rather than my own words because in  Ive heard about chemtrails but as a skeptical grown up learning to science rather than blindly believe any BS I people tell me I would have never ever imagined what I was goign to witness hence Ive never thought that NASA could have been involved in some kind of global conspiracy to deny the chemtrails existence from the public opinion. Therefore Ive never thought about making a screenshot or to record myself browsing their website to support my claims. Why did they change it? I dont have any clueWell its not just you out there  none of the chemtrails conspiracy theorists then or now have documented a change in NASAs statements on contrail persistence which should be pretty easy to do if it happened.  And since there are many scientific articles and other sources from the decades prior which state that contrails can persist for hours  including some written by NASA scientists  it seems more likely to me that you just remembered wrong.,chemtrails,cpiwj9s,1,t5_2qnov

7323311,0,t1_d2alj6a,Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin kerosene it is a hydrocarbon. When it burns in air the carbon part combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas CO and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water Dihydrogen Monoxide HO. These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy.  kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about . kilos of water which boils instantly into  litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is already saturated with water vapour then these crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through a process called deposition and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature pressure and humidity and nothing else. Water is an amazing substance with some unique properties which defy logic. It is important to realise that water does not freeze at zero centigrade. It will freeze at any temperature from zero degrees down to minus  zero degrees is defined as the point where pure frozen water melts not freezes. Suspended in air it can coexist as vapour liquid and solid simultaneously. Liquid water droplets ice crystals and invisible water vapour cold steam are found together in clouds where the temperature is minus  centigrade or Fahrenheit its the temperature where they both agree. Even clear air will contain a lot of subzero water vapour. Its not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.,chemtrails,d2alz5n,6,t5_2qnov
