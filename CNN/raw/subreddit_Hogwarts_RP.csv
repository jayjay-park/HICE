In her books it was just that. A flick of the wrist a word spoken and reality bent to her favorite characters fingertips. However Matilda just could not get the hang of it.She stared at her egg at contempt as if it was the object of her doom. She tried her three Ps The first P picturing it was the easiest It was well an egg. Pale brown eggshaped small. The third P position was easy as well There it was. On the other side of the desk. Silently gloating.Accio! She said flicking her wrist as demonstrated. And... nothing. Green sparks flew from her wand  inches hawthorne wood phoenix feather core rigid yet bendable which was something but the egg didnt fly into her hand as it was supposed to.Maybe she was sorted into the wrong house.Matilda scooted over to the Slytherin on the other side of the bench the small boy staring at his wand.Hello? She said voice lilting. Do you understand this? I cant get it to work.,Hogwarts_RP,daekx7h,1,t5_3hjz2

Zach made a silent vow to take this more seriously he needed to pass the OWLs in a few years so he wouldnt come back home a loser.Yeah it will get harder but at least this challenge is done... Lets go turn this in so that we can get a grade for it at least.  My first passing grade..  hopefully Im nervous.uKathLon,Hogwarts_RP,daj17c0,1,t5_3hjz2
