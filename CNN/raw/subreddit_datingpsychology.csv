8585474,0,t3_4w1f6b,The short answer He likes you! Its very obvious and guys are not that complicated or hard to read. The small signs that youve picked up on already tell a convincing story hes definitely smitten by you. Going after a girl can be nerve racking for a guy. Correction It IS nerve racking even if they otherwise seem very confident and arrogant. The arrogance is usually a cover for their selfconsciousness or slight insecurities but its not a bad thing its normal. He might actually just be a relatively sensitive person on the inside. You said that you dont show much emotion or give hints that you like him back? This makes him more nervous. If you do like him hell be excited about it. Its possible he knows yes but it doesnt mean he knows how to act on it. You need to start normal conversation and keep it going past the awkwardness until you two can develop a comfortable rapport. Be blunt with him help him out a little bit and make him finally stop being so shy and tell you how he really feels. Think you can do that? If you do like him its the right move help him come out of the shell a little bit. Its not worth playing games in these situations and potentially missing out on something more. Make him wake up and go after you! Youll thank me for this advice. Report back and let me know how it goes.  Good luckSW,datingpsychology,d6ersfu,2,t5_35dbs
