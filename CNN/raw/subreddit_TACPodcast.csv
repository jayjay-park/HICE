I routinely beat warrior with mine on ladder which is its worst matchup.As Meldorr said i won once with warrior and mage and then Meldorr and I came down to an oil rogue mirror and he won with a huge burst at the end.

5041082,0,t3_3jxgow,What a worthless rant of an article.Netdecking has been a part of every noteworthy TCG since there was internet.  Replace netdecking with sharing of ideas and the entire article has a completely different tone.There is Im willing to bet a significant portion of HS players who really enjoy the game but dont have the time to make viable decks from the ground up because.....life.  In addition I wholeheartedly encourage new players to netdeck as it can give you ideas of working strategies that are relevant to the current meta.   In addition its extremely easy for newer players to be simply lost.  Why build the wheel from the ground up when you can stand on the shoulders of giants?People obviously do terrible with machine learning thats why we have guides.  The author is asking people to bang their heads against the wall until they find out for themselves what works.  LAME a waste of time not fun the entire point of playing the game and a needless exercise in frustration.Netdecking raises the bar of play and similar to darwinisim only the main winning decks survive the cut and see play.  Also it may inspire ideas for players to tweak the decks to their playstyle for yet more enjoyable games or give players ideas they would have never thought of adding yet more tools to their arsenal.The author says First Hearthstone is very simplistic in terms of mechanics.  The same could be said with chess.  Easy to learn but incredibly hard to master.This author needs to get a clue.,TACPodcast,cutn3rd,8,t5_305c2

11672223,0,t1_dgioxod,gt  Fear of down votes This is a natural and normal fear but by staying away you might lose actual conversations about both sides of the argument. Some people will agree and some people will disagree. It is great to hear them out.Fear of downvotes doesnt mean I am worried people wont agree with me.  I am worried it will get downvoted with no explanation and no discussion will be had. Generally smaller subreddits are less likely for this to occur.  rhearthstone is generally full of highlights streamers complaints etc.  Which is fine but I just didnt see my post getting ANY traction there.  It isnt just the legendaries there have been a fairly large amount of cards released over the last  expansions focused on discard mechanicDarkshire Librarian  Lakkari Felhound Malchezaars Imp Cruel Dinomancer Silverware GolemPlus the old discard cards  Soulfire Succubus DoomguardSo  legionaries   other discard based mechanics available for Warlock.  Again this is AFTER a lot of former Warlock staple cards rotated out of the standard format.   My opinion of the Warlock quest power is primarily based off trying various ways of making work and realizing it is just too difficult and slow.  I brought up the Rogue Quest because it is currently somewhere between StronggtOP.  So it gives us an idea of  how strong a quest needs to be to be competitive.  Warlock is both harder much harder to complete than Rogues and has a much more powerful IMMEDIATE impact on the game.  It also synergizes better with the Rogue cards prep shadowstep etc.  It is also way more consistent because you arent at the mercy of RNG.    I dont mind RNG but I wish Blizzard would seek out RNG variables that give the player more control.  To some extent you can control the discard RNG basically make sure you the play the minionsspells you need andor just emptying your hand before playing a discard card zoo lock.  But with this quest there isnt really a reliableconsistent way to control the discard RNG.  You very often are forced to just gamble on having perfect discard RNG because you lose if you dont play the card and you lose if you discard the wrong cards.  These are fun situations to win or lose in IMO.  Blizzard could consider altering the discard mechanic to be a little less unpredictable.  Like what if you got to pick two cards in your deck to be discarded then it randomly chooses which of those gets discarded making it always a  chance you discard the card you wanted instead of a  based off how many cards are in your hand.  So if a player has  cards in their hand and they absolutely cant afford to discard one of them then they choose the other  to be eligible for discard.  Or what if it was you just discarded the lowest cost minion.  I dont mind RNG.  I dislike RNG that can completely makebreak a game and is  out of the players hands to manipulate the chances of success.  This legendary quests essentially requires you to build a deck that will often require you take take awful gambles.  Cards like Silverware Golem I am not a fan of either.  It is either a crap  for  minion or an insane tempo gain say if it gets discarded turn .  I wish Blizzard did a better job balancing the potential outcomes to limit how widly they can vary.  Make Silverware Golem a  for  mana or if discarded it is a  for free.  Blizzard makes a lot of cards that are either amazing if RNG lands perfectly or awful if it doesnt.  Implosion for example can be an awful  mana deal  damage summon  imps OR and AMAZING  mana deal  damage summon  imps.    I guess my post was more alternativesfuture avenues.  I dont expect them to really alter Warlock until the next expansion.  It just feels like the last  expansions havent added a ton of reliable tools for the Warlock and Blizzard continues to make these discard cards that I dont think is the bestmost creative route to keep following.  My advice on the path to a uniquefun Warlock class to play  Keep Demons.  Keep Sacrifices health mana etc..  Reduce the amount of RNG based discard cards.Thanks for the well written post.  You brought up great counter arguments.  ,TACPodcast,dgj29m2,2,t5_305c2
