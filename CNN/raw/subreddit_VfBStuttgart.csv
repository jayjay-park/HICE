1998049,0,t3_2hmcph,A lot of misses but a lot pushing of the team today. A lot of possesion and many attacks Stuttgart was playing well but Problem was the finishing today. In the first half nothing was working together in the box it went better in HT which had some good combinations. I guess our luck with goals has really to be forced with  people in the box and chaostikitaka  playing flipper. The defense was good during DangerTime and stayed focused but that was still a pain to endure. I think we should go brutal and veh should make the whole team stand inside the box or something.I liked the Solid Performances by Kostic Leitner Big Surprise! Sakai Dida Rdiger and of course Schwaab the Vollstrecker.WELL DONE BOYS!LOL of the Match  Der Ball war in der Entstehung nicht ber der  Linie  RonRobert Zieler,VfBStuttgart,cktyqpp,5,t5_2v51x
2044342,0,t1_ckzoe3p,I would add Klein to the list of good players in the first half. Ibisevic started very good and he was obvoiusly very motivated but somehow he lost focus after  minutes... again. ,VfBStuttgart,ckzoiy6,3,t5_2v51x

5482231,0,t1_cwb78ph,I really like what Zorniger is doing with the team. I feel like hes putting the boys in good positions to succeed. Its just been a couple mental lapses on the defense each game that have killed us. Or in yesterdays case Florian Klein forgetting he was playing defense.Im not sure why Maxim isnt getting more playing time but Im sure Zorniger has his reasons.,VfBStuttgart,cwcemvq,2,t5_2v51x

6767575,0,t1_d0jd7zb,I totally agree Niedermeier is always prone to a mistake or two. During the games I rarely even notice Schwaab is playing cause he is so smooth which is a good thing for a defender. He really has stepped up these last few weeks. ,VfBStuttgart,d0jduw3,2,t5_2v51x

8140927,0,t3_4qr06e,What the fuckEDIT on second thought developing as a second option on a favourite for immediate promotion in the second league would be an almost ideal situation for a young unproven player with potential. If he wants to play in the Bundesliga sitting on Hamburgs bench then good riddance hope we got a good compensation out of it.Hes talented but hasnt shown anything in the few times he was on the pitch.EDIT  Hes getting loaned out to Dsseldorf for one season. Im fucking done.EDIT   million transfer fee according to Bild.,VfBStuttgart,d4v5tcs,13,t5_2v51x

10945392,0,t3_5wa9ow,This really seemed like a tactical chess match. Kaiserslautern is legit on defense. We are legit on offense. Agree that I too thought it would end  at one point. But seemed like we won with our brains today as much as our superior individual talent which is a great sign. Key  point win and  pt overall weekend gain over Hannover especially with a huge game next week. ,VfBStuttgart,de8xuhd,5,t5_2v51x
