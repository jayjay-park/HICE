423681,0,t1_cfo9hma,Good! Bring in the Tinkle suggestions for the caregiver doctor and the Pocinki paper this is good for all of our doctors to have. Why the Zebra?When you hear the sound of hooves think horses not zebras.This phrase is taught to medical students throughout their training. In medicine the term zebra is used in reference to a rare disease or condition.  Doctors are taught to assume that the simplest explanation is usually correct to avoid patients being misdiagnosed with rare illnesses.  Doctors learn to expect common conditions.But many medical professionals seem to forget that zebras DO exist and so getting a diagnosis and treatment can be more difficult for sufferers of rare conditions.  EhlersDanlos Syndrome is considered a rare condition and so EDS sufferers are known as medical zebras.  This identity has now been adopted across the world through social media to help bring our community together.,ehlersdanlos,cfooh18,1,t5_2spw0

690182,0,t1_cgio3qe,Thank you for such a thoughtful response! I have discussed with my partner the risks of passing it on and mostly we decided that we will hope for boys and go from there. My mom is diagnosed with the same type but shes not really someone I can talk to about that. But we definitely feel that having our own biological child is the way we want to go. I am also interested in experiencing pregnancy and all of those things despite the risks. I know that may seem selfish but I would definitely explore other avenues if I discover more risks. Its not something I take lightly but I wont be able to feasibly do it for a few years. I would like to be prepared going into it especially understanding that I may have to majorly rearrange my plans.You gave me some good points to consider.

1528359,0,t3_2bnl3g,Im sending you lots of love from across at Atlantic. Sounds like youre having an awful time and I really hope that it gets better soon. The pain clinic sounds very sensible you need to have your pain managed. Id also recommend seeing a more specialist rheumatologist to discuss your symptoms and management plans. You should be able to find one online if not talk to your GP and investigate. Also pick one nice GP and stick with them! Continuity and a caring GP are going to be important. Id also recommend some general all over physio strengthen key areas of your body and it sounds like some further investigation or treatment for your neck and knees physio etc. I saw someone else recommended a tens machine get one they are amazing! Its also sad things are taking a turn for the worse with your SO I sort of understand why people struggle to emphasis with people who have invisible illnesses but it ends up not being fair on us. Society in general still struggles with how to treat people with disabilities. I think being open and honest with your SO is really the only course of action yes your condition has deteriorated and yes you will probably need extra support at the moment. Would including them in doctors appointments and research help them feel more involved? Some people finds it helps people understand better. Have you talked to anyone at work about whats going on? Not sure what your states employment laws are might be worth checking I know some can be much less understanding. Good luck I hope that you get some more in depth care to help you.

I had a case of near symptomless strep that turned into rheumatic fever in college thats got me in the middle of a  year daily antibiotic treatment so I have to get checked for strep every time I get sick or have any throat issues at all.

3928775,0,t3_35g3e0,I was sent to a MFM when I was pregnant. It can depend on your classification.If you are vascular be prepared for talk of termination. It may not happen with yours but thats the first thing that my MFM brought up just due to the fact that we werent sure about my classification at that point and the higher chance of fatality in labor.They most likely will have biweekly ultrasounds which is a plus! some heart function tests. I would ask how familiar the MFM is with EDS if heshe has had any experience with an EDS delivery what their plan of care will consist of and what type of concerns you should call about.I would really stress having the MFM be familiar with EDS because there is so much relaxin in your body during pregnancy that POTS SPD and vision changes are more likely to happen. My POTS went crazy in my third trimester and had crazy hip dislocations that were dismissed as being uncomfortable and just extra blood volume by my regular OB and wasnt mentioned to my MFM. A good MFM if they are aware of how pregnancy can be effected can really help you have a pleasant pregnancy and delivery.Congratulations!,ehlersdanlos,cr446gn,2,t5_2spw0

So not only are you knowingly putting your child at a high risk for a disease with no cure that could easily run their lifeyoure also deciding that even though its your choice to have them its there responsibility as an adult to literally pay for your decision.I am allowed my opinions and if they feel like judgments thats your interpretation. I guess I find it a bit disturbing people are knowingly putting their child at a high risk to inherit a chronic pain disorder or something that could easily kill them before they reach the end of their s when if they want to be parents they could adopt from a child already alive and in need of a home.

4906984,0,t3_3i37uy,I have moderate to severe EDS and use a wheelchair pretty much fulltime for mobility. What struck me about switching from a Walk at all costs perspective is how much LESS pain Im in. My hips are absolute murder especially when Im regularly bearing weight into them. I have much more energy for other activities when Im not constantly reinjuring myself from walking. I also progressed much more in physical therapy because I wasnt overusing my lower body in daily life giving my legs time to heal has made my life livable again. So my point is dont let walking be some line in the sand. Encourage your son to do what is most healing and least painful. Maybe some parttime or temporary fulltime wheelchair use will allow him to be more functional when he does walk and that might be an acceptable solution. Focus on quality of life not just function. Nobody likes to see their child in pain. Best of luck to you and your son. ,ehlersdanlos,cud28u9,7,t5_2spw0
4958651,0,t3_3inpcm,Some of us lucky folk are stuck. Sleeping means waking up in pain with dislocations however a lack of sleep means tiredness fatigue and probably a lot of other stuff. But just on the tiredness front most people will have concentration issues when tired. Its not a giant leap to see how people who dislocate easy are at more risk when not well rested.Personally I sleep for a few hours at a time then wake up in pain so I sleep whenever I get tired  sometimes it means I sleep for half of the day and next to no sleep at night but as far as I know its another problem we have to deal with.What did help was self hypnotherapy I found some on YouTube that either worked or bored me to sleep and meditation not monks sitting round saying ommmm just controlled breathing with guided mediation again via YouTube so I would say give them a try,ehlersdanlos,cujkt30,1,t5_2spw0

Almost always first thing in the morning though.

I dont often get stomach pains though. Usually Im just  to  with nausea followed by gagging followed by vomiting if I cant resist the gagging. Often my warning is either brain fog or extreme sensitivity to heat or smell. Oh and when Im in my nauseous state I should not under any circumstances bend over. That really sets me off.Im pretty sure my mom and her mom have EDS but my mom cant get a proper doctor where shes at and her mom has Parkinsons and is so sick of doctors she refuses to hear of it and doesnt understand why her getting checked out has any bearing on me getting a diagnoses. Ugh. Thank you for letting me know all this. Perhaps this is another common connection to EDS doctors havent yet put on paper it would make sense if the stress of the pain combined with our crappy connective tissue constantly throws our GI systems for a loop relative to coming up we already know it affects going down IBS.

I actually do handpoked tattoos on myself and on others which there is some stigma over but I found that the handpoked ones are much more delicate bleed less and cause less intense scarring. I also have a machine done tattoo before I started doing my own which caused more bleeding and the ink is raised which only happens slightly on the handpoked work. I did also have the experience of smaller needles being more likely to bleed  theyre also more painful because of how pointed and direct they are they dont have as many needles to distribute the pain to a wider amount of skin like larger needles do.

6397764,0,t1_czgtk4b,EDS doesnt have many treatments  about as many as fibro  but the treatment path is very different.  Fibromyalgia is nerve and brainrelated an oversensitivity to pain.  EDS is much more of a physical condition. Unfortunately theres not a whole lot to know   There are a lot of ways EDS can affect your life depending on what kind you have  the geneticist will help with that  and its a little different for everyone.  Ive found it very helpful to try to learn a lot on your own most doctors know next to nothing about this.  There are some great books out there and a ton of information online.  The Joint Hypermobility Handbook by Dr. Brad Tinkle heh Tinkle is a great resource.  Everything else Ive learned has been online.  Knowing how EDS affects your life is most of the treatment.  For example  I know I have POTS because of it and that has some specific effective treatments so Im being treated for POTS.  And I know I cant walk long distances because it directly causes joint pain so I avoid that as much as possible.  Your doctor will probably suggest physical therapy learning how to exercise in ways that wont hurt you and hopefully some other treatment options as well.  Antiinflammatories are awesome for joints that bang around too much.  If you have digestive issues constipation gut pain nausea etc. theres a lot that can be done for that!  EDS can affect your whole body  itll take a while to figure everything out but once you have a diagnosis you can start working down the list  ,ehlersdanlos,czguyyp,2,t5_2spw0
6420577,0,t1_cysi0th,I used to work for disability services at Drexel U. DM if I can help. Make sure you get a letter about the accommodations you need from your doc ASAP. Meet with disability services at your school ASAP. They cannot explain the nature of your disability with your professors. I would ask for note taking service extra time for texts and assignments flexibility if you have a lot of doctors appointments. There are even audio books of texts lab materials to accomodate poor vision. It takes a while to accomodate but according to the ADA the will. This also applies to any employment you have with the school as a  work study tutor teaching assistant or straight employee. Good luck ,ehlersdanlos,czjfa7g,1,t5_2spw0

That being said since it is a common injury in people of all ages who knows if it is attributed to EDS or not.

Some things that a noneds person would be able to do we cantshouldnt so it is very important to have someone that understands how your body works and that its not like everyone else. Is it a small clinic you are going to or a chain? Somewhere that is a chain would be easier to find another PT that may know more or would be able to teach your PT more about Ehlers. The PT community overall is very close and wants to work with each other for whats best for the patient so I would just communicate this to yours.,ehlersdanlos,d0sixpu,2,t5_2spw0

Im sorry to hear you had a similar or worse experience with your rheumatologist. Hopefully if we all keep pushing for proper diagnosis and standing our ground the diagnosis of EDS will become a lot more common and doctors will have to get more educated on it eventually.

7579123,0,t3_4h1brw,Hey there. I was in a similar position when I got my diagnosis...in pain broke clueless doctors phone calls causing panic attacks had to move back in with parents. I googled for geneticists in my state and emailed the closest genetics clinic  hours away to ask if they could diagnose EDS. Then I nagged my primary doctor for a referral. I ended up discovering that the geneticists visit my city once a month we have a shortage of geneticists here so the few we do have travel to several places so I wouldnt have to travel to see them. I also discovered that the genetics clinic had a financial assistance program and since I was broke and had no income they didnt charge me for my appointment. So yeah if you email doctorsclinics be sure to ask if they have financial assistance programs if your insurance wont cover the cost of the appointment. Do you have a family member or someone who can help with phone calls if any need to be made?

When we get injured our body compensates and uses a different pattern different muscles different firing times different structural mechanics of the body.

8686986,0,t1_d6rfyib,No problem Ill try to give a detailed account of my symptoms. For the record I am a male diagnosed with JHS at  later with EDS at  POTS and SFN at . Skip to the end if you dont want the detail Ill just give a list there.It started in May . I was lying on my stomach and began to feel a tingling in the sole of my left foot. After a few days this feeling had not stopped and I began to feel it in my right foot as well. There was no pain just a constant tingling feeling. After a couple weeks the feeling came in the palms of my hands as well. These symptoms worsened spreading slowly to include the rest of my hands and feet. By the end of the summer I had been tested for diabetes nonfasting but it was negative and had an EMG which was normal. Towards the end of summer these symptoms had all but disappeared. I noticed stress was the most reliable trigger for these symptoms.However once the Fall semester began the symptoms returned with much more force. The tingling slowly became more distressing and I started to feel it around my entire body. These were also associated with light muscle twitching Im actually uncertain to what extent that is due to SFN because as far as I know there shouldnt be any muscle neuron involvement and I plan to ask my doctor about that next week. I began to experience urinary retention which spurred fears of MS and other autoimmune diseases. Burning pain developed in my feet coming on after walking and heat my feet had also randomly gone red and hot for about a year before this. I would have a daily wave of fatigue that was accompanied by IBStype symptoms and brain fog. Its worth mentioning that at this time my stress level was very high.After I was cleared of MS and other autoimmune disorders my anxiety level dropped and so did many of my symptoms although this time they did not disappear completely. Over the next few months the tingling and other symptoms would fluctuate never too dominant nor absent. Much of the time it feels like a flu is coming on that never quite arrives leaving me with a feeling of painful skin.I found SFN online and sought out a neurologist who does skin biopsies and tilt table tests to diagnose SFN and POTS. I had these tests done in May . My skin biopsy taken from ankle and thigh came back positive for small fiber neuropathy. It was nonlength dependent as my thigh showed less nerve fibers than my ankle.I had tried to avoid any medication up to this time but recently Ive started Gabapentin because I am also dealing with likely pudendal neuropathy and pelvic pain. Both pudendal neuropathy and SFN have been shown to cause hyperarousal aka PGAD which I have also experienced off and on. Im currently dealing with the aforementioned symptoms as well as occasional restless leg.TLDR normal EMG and blood work normal brain MRI skin tingling beginning in feet then hands and spreading burning in feet and hands fatigue restless leg itching and crawling sensations hyperesthesia and allodynia hyperarousal and pelvic pain and IBS type symptoms.,ehlersdanlos,d6ri0t3,1,t5_2spw0

There is now some suspicion in the medical community that EDS can actually cause autism since autistics have been show to have greater joint mobility than neurotypicals along with a lot of other EDSlike symptoms. But no one has done a full study to verify the link. Right now they are still at the stage of gathering supporting anecdotal evidence and conjecturing about possible mechanisms. I am personally in the process of trying to get diagnosed for both and I believe the EDS is the cause because its the only way I can explain the astronomically rare combination of bizarre traits and conditions both physical and cognitive that I see in myself.,ehlersdanlos,dc44ytf,1,t5_2spw0
10247381,0,t1_dc4x4ln,Ive not been diagnosed with MCAS. I am seeing a consultant at the moment whos doing further tests because he thinks I have more forms of dysautonomia.

10361305,0,t3_5odczl,I had to do that  months ago and it was scary but it all worked out.  If you are moving to Seattle let me know!I do floats and did IV lidocane I am not sure how they would work for other people but I can explain what they do for me Both treat muscle spasm which helps a lot with the pain and poor alignment my joints go back in to place much easier after treatment so I try to pair them with adjustments when I can.The other thing that they do for me is help break the choinc pain cycle which is more theorical.  The idea is that your nervous system learns and becomes more efficient so being in pain teaches your body to hurt.  IV lidocane just truns all the pain off for a short period of time but in doing so breaks the ongoing process where the nocioceptive system is activated and getting more efficient.  Floating seems to have something of the same kind of effect for me even though why isnt as clear.,ehlersdanlos,dciijrd,1,t5_2spw0

I apparently walk strangely with knock knees and have terrible pronation so have had orthotics as long as I remember. I had mystery lower back pain as a kid that flares up every once in a while. Could my hands etc be stiff from EDS? I just know that my double hip labral tears my constant clicking and popping having to kick my knees back into place often and all of this pain cant be unrelated right?

10620644,0,t3_5ryj58,Could it be your SI joint being unstable? I have a lot of pain in my lower back hips and legs and have realised that its because the joint isnt holding together properly. I was reading about it yesterday and it said that in some cases it causes sciaticalike shooting pains. It presumably wouldnt show up on an Xray because its ligaments not being right enough. Dunno just a thought?,ehlersdanlos,ddbftet,3,t5_2spw0
10672086,0,t3_5sonsz,Im  been with my bf for almost  years and hes .  Things are currently rough bc I am going in for transplant evaluation in just  weeks and if they dont approve me well we all know what happens after being on TPN for a whilemy liver is already having problems and its only been  weeks  That being said we got to live together in manhattan for a while and it was nice getting to see him every night. Of course that had to end when my GI issues worsened and I moved home. I had two strokes that spring due to my skull subluxing off my neck thanks to AAI and CCI and chiari compressing my brain stem and spinal cord and blocking brain fluid flow. I then dropped out of college after nearly dying from malnutrition. Got a feeding tube bc my stomach and colon didnt work and it only worked out for  months bc then my small bowel failed. Forced to use wheelchair bc I tore my labrum and already had severe SIJ issues so I was only walking  days a week prior to the tear. Through all this there have been hard months and easy months for our relationship. This month is a hard one for example. Today he told me he was essentially questioning our relationship bc he wants to be able to take me out and do things but I cant. Yet ultimately we agreed we are better together than apart and he said that I help him get through the day bc I never give up. I hardly see him anymore bc I cant drive and he works a lot but when we do see each other Im happy. By the end of the month things may change drastically it really all depends on whether the transplant team deems me fit or unfit. Not everything is doom and gloom though. I think it is extremely important not to see yourself as just the relationship. For example I have no doubt Id immediately start dating other people if we broke up bc if there is anything Ive learned its that you cant waste time. All the life threatening things that are going on only started within the last  years. Thats like a second in the grand scheme of things. You should still be your own person. I was proud of myself today bc I didnt get really upset when my bf told me how he felt about the future of our relationship. I realize survival is more important friendship family etc. Its not that I dont love him but that I love myself too and I have been a hundred different people in the few years weve been together and I cant say Ill still be in love w him if I get all fixed up bc I will be like a new person.Beyond all this I still hope to get through all this and get my urban design degree start my own company and leave the country. Is it unlikely? Yeah but I thought needing several transplants at  would never happen and I never thought Id fall in love. I also never planned on dropping out or not being able to eat or drink. Point is Im not alone even though I thought I would be but I am also confident enough now that I can say I would be ok alone too. Ive survived some horrible stuff and I got through it I still am. Surprisingly the things I am most looking forward to arent relationship related but selfish things like jetting off to Europe or convincing my cousin to go to college here so I can have a little sister. My best friend is bipolar and has arthritis. She recently decided the best thing she can do for her mental health is to not date anyone just hook up and if she finds someone she really likes and can handle bipolar then fine but until then it is all about her health. I cant disagree w it I think this is an active choice anyone with an illness has to make at some point. Edit Id also like to point out that my best friends coworkers told her they think Im gorgeous and not in a pitythewheelchairgirl way so remember youre hot no matter what kind of mobility aid you need and dont ever think youre not.,ehlersdanlos,ddgqtmt,5,t5_2spw0
10689982,0,t3_5stjaj,Mine locks up and my Chiro will gently pop it back into place he puts kinesio tape on it so it will stay in place. I ice it afterwards and sleep flat on my back for a couple days to ensure my habitual side sleeping doesnt lock it back up or slip it out of place usually inward unlike yours. A Doctor of Osteopathy could also fix it for you if Chiropractors arent your speed. Good luck ,ehlersdanlos,ddilcmf,1,t5_2spw0

10849568,0,t3_5uxk35,When the landlord replaced the shower head he replaced it with one that was shorter and since then I havent been able to wash myself without taking a standing shower which I cant do on days my POTS is really bad. I havent been able to find a super convenient way to sponge bathe without needing to get up and down off the floor to refill bowls I can carry at the sink.But today I invented a new system by putting a tub on the floor and filling it with water from the laundry sink with the garden hose then sitting on the floor in the shower with a small pouring jug bathing that way. I feel refreshed and I dont feel concussed so thats a huge win.And more good news! Ive been waiting  months but my OT appointment is this week so they might have even better ideas  My mum is taking the day off work and driving across state to come with me because ive been waiting too long and struggling on my own too hard to risk the OT not understanding me or understanding how bad it can be at home.,ehlersdanlos,ddz21aq,3,t5_2spw0

11050933,0,t1_dekj19z,So much this! So many more doctors took me seriously with that diagnosis letter its precious to me cause without it Im just a drug seeker. Yup thats a fun place to be with doctors be patient and wait for the geneticist they will look at all your symptoms collectively and bring those letters your doc didnt read  the geneticist will want to read them. Id seriously be offended by the statement of whats your endgame? A diagnosis can help with so much open up treatment options that wouldnt be available otherwise and allows pain meds if necessary. Doctors like that ought to be shot but if he gives you a referral to right doc hes worth keeping around for a bit.Good luck Im sorry the process can be so damned frustrating!,ehlersdanlos,deklrem,3,t5_2spw0

11348390,0,t3_61xeah,My PT says that whenever a joint begins to hurt its already out of place a little bit even when its not fully subluxed or dislocated. The pain is caused by the bone pressing  against nerves or tissue where it shouldnt be. For me a sublux is when I noticeably feel the joint slide out of place. I then check to see if it feels right back in place. If not then its probably dislocated especially if the pain persists and I dont have a full range of motion in that joint,ehlersdanlos,dfibi5x,1,t5_2spw0

Eventually Ill start having anxiety about a specific thing if I dont make a conscious effort to tell myself its nothing and just anxiety and a physical phenomenon. Thats not to say my anxiety is never triggered by anything specific but its happened a lot where there was no trigger. Still curious about it but I dont know that I have any other real dysautonomia like symptoms so it doesnt seem worth bothering my physician to check it out and him potentially thinking Im a hypochondriac lol,ehlersdanlos,dgdfoce,1,t5_2spw0

However breaking this giant blob of problems into chunks has really helped make some things more manageable. For example treating brain and memory issues as ADD has led to help in the form of ADD meds. So my brains a little better and Im less frustrated and can take care of my body better. Maybe someone helping you identify little fixes will lead to more overall wellbeing. Good luck!,ehlersdanlos,dgvixa7,2,t5_2spw0
