6774835,0,t1_d0jihlw,Thats strange about it being a health code violation. What state is this in if I may ask? Were drivethru only and we offer all day refills. To my knowledge its definitely not a health code violation here. But maybe since were just a drivethru the rules are different?,ChickFilA,d0k7li1,1,t5_2t7g3
7121660,0,t1_d1nkr56,Unfortunately that seems to be the case. I dont mind adding new options but totally replacing things shouldnt be the standard practice.,ChickFilA,d1nncfy,1,t5_2t7g3
7743261,0,t1_d3ly378,i got the deluxe. I didnt realize they had the exact same sandwich as wendys. well I guess it would be that wendys has the same sandwich as chick fil a since according to them theyre the original chicken sandwich.whatever the case I got waffle fries too. I dont know what chick fil a sauce is thats the one thing I was missing was a good sauce. man i will say tho the fresh tomatoes and very fresh lettuce made it great. and the waffle fries were great.I cannot believe how nice those people were. I always thought this was just a fast food joint. its not. its much nicer with a similar format.ill be going back for sure,ChickFilA,d3mcpa2,2,t5_2t7g3
7860299,0,t1_d1pk30q,Seriously? Why cant you just take the pickles off? Chick Fil A is a fast food restaurant not a five star restaurant. I dont see why everyone has such high expectations people make mistakes just take the pickles off. Its not that hard. ,ChickFilA,d3zkh5q,1,t5_2t7g3
8286960,0,t3_4szmti,well looks like Ill have to try it today.I heard the buffalo is new as wellEDIT Went to CfA for lunch and they still had the old BBQ at the one I go to no smokehouse. ,ChickFilA,d5dfg43,4,t5_2t7g3

8996458,0,t1_d7scki9,I dont feel thats true. I feels its similar enough. Both the dentist and CFA are places offering you a service making food and checking your teeth. Both places want you to be comfortable. Both want to ensure you have an enjoyable warm experience so that youll return and hopefully will pass on the word about your experience in a positive way. And if you return to a place often enough the employees will try to learn your name and greet you like a friend or at least someone they are familiar with. Thats what CFA would do. At my restaurant we had several regulars. We learned their names had small talk with them became invested with them. You grow a relationship with the guests over time. They become your friend. Its hard to do that if you cant connect in the most simplest way knowing each others name. Im sorry. I just dont see how that would bother anyone. Lol. I did have this strange experience though when a gentleman came into the restaurant to order food. Did the whole thing. Asked for his name. He said why do you need my name? In like this dark serious voice. I was taken aback. I was like um so we can give you your order? He stayed quiet. So I cautiously prompted So could I have your name sir? He looked angry shouted that he wasnt going to give it then promptly left the restaraunt. Probably one of the weirdest experiences. The team and I speculated about it for a while. The most outlandish reasons being hes on the run he has to live off the grid because of big brother or that hes a hit man and cant leave a trail no matter how small. Though he could have just lied and given us an alias and we wouldnt have known any different. P,ChickFilA,d7t8gp6,1,t5_2t7g3

11210218,0,t1_df1wg1b,Possibly? But the meat is supposed to be cooked at a high enough temperature to ensure any bacteria would be eliminated. It could possibly be someone was working with contaminated gloves. Or didnt wipe down an area properly after handling raw chicken which could have led to contamination elsewhere. It could be that the fryers werent heated at the right temperature to cook the nuggets which could be a mechanical or human error. The machine could read a high temp when It really wasnt or someone in a rush could have ignorednot noticed it and dropped in a batch anyways. It could be that the breading was too thick and prevented the nuggets from cooking thoroughly. It could be anything honestly. You could have contracted it from anything. It can be from beef eggs poultry milk and sometimes vegetables. It takes anywhere from  hours for symptoms to show up. It could be what you guys ate for breakfast. Or the night before. Or the day before. Theres literally no way to know how or where it happened unless someone was following you around at minimum  hours before you ate at CFA and tested all of your food. Though you could go back to the same restaurant and try to get duplicate results or testing done? Still I would report it to corporate if you havent already. ,ChickFilA,df2nysb,3,t5_2t7g3
