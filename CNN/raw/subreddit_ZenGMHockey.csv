8505378,0,t1_d63nwb8,This is an area where it could be improved. I tried doing a quick fix and ran into some issues. So Ill probably try again if I think of something or after Im finished with this major update Im going to be working on over the next few months.The first year the AI will keep your roster in within the minmax of payroll and players unless you do it yourself. After that it will give a warning message. So you get through on the same loophole the AI teams get that first year. After that it will give a warning message.,ZenGMHockey,d64q6ea,2,t5_32zjy
