2190708,0,t3_2juorc,Hey I hope its not too late to answer this  just saw it.  If you are working in Frankton consider living in Dinsdale.  It has nice houses with nice yards mainly.  There are a couple of parks for running.  If you dont have to cross a bridge to get to work your life will be much easier.,thetron,cliajkz,3,t5_2sbx4

6555474,0,t3_45dlbk,Strange. I thought it was the synthetic weed shops that were attracting scumbags and making cities horrible places. Since it was banned  months ago everything should be sunshine and roses now.Also this woman sounds like shes got an incredibly thin skin. Perhaps the real reason was simply that the Garden place store wasnt making any money. If they were raking in the bucks Im sure she would have stuck around.,thetron,czxe11v,5,t5_2sbx4
