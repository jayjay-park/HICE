1497110,0,t1_cj2qs1w,Interesting idea. I tried adding a bunch of water on the idea that if that was what was happening the extra water would cause it to happen less but once it came up to temp again it started doing the same thing.,homechemistry,cj3xrd6,1,t5_2u23a
2547821,0,t1_cmqxnvo,I had to regrow some seed crystals first the thumbsized crystal I had intended to start with had become desiccated. Ive got it set up now using the mono filament but Im going for a slow and steady evaporation rate so itll probably be a while before I get visible results.My other two slowevaporation crystal projects Rochelle salt and salicylic acid both recently sprang into action though so at least Ive got something to look at! No luck with the pseudoephedrine test setup yet. May not have reached saturation yet.,homechemistry,cmr4y55,1,t5_2u23a
6801147,0,t1_d0mj229,Can you post a link of where to buy a carbon filtration system for water? Btw is that even costefficient?Im also worried about ice tea and milk though Im not sure if those do contain estrogens,homechemistry,d0n7beu,2,t5_2u23a

9627965,0,t1_d9y3iqd,Sadly just a vacuum pump would love to get some nitrogen in there though! Yeah equal usage for acylation purposes and decoration with that bottle of AcO. ,homechemistry,d9zuewr,1,t5_2u23a
