32026,0,t3_1ugssw,No the way the VNDS converter can not convert the .bmp files that FSN has. It does not have any impact on gameplay. However I have encountered an error with the script when converting actually apparently I had all  routes unlocked instead of just the fate route and my text got really buggy.

Grisaia no Kajitsu on the other hand is k characters being slightly longer than Clannad which is about k.

Read on a forum somewhere about Kana Little Sister and gave it a shot.Started it at around  that night and sat in my room until like  in the morning bawling my eyes out all the way to the end at the age of . That was when I started playing them for the story rather than the porn. Others Ive really enjoyed since then are Kara no Shojou Katawa Shojou Everything by TypeMoon and SHUFFLE!

405302,0,t3_1yntdk,The worst Ive ever played? Probably The Nettestadt Troll I didnt expect that much since its one of those free Renpy games thats essentially the equivalent of a bad fanfic but this one is especially bad.For one thing the art is terrible. All of the women are drawn the same just with different hair and colors. The backgrounds look like something youd find in an elementary or middle school art class. It is thoroughly mediocre.Also the plot is super contrived and full of holes. It takes places in some random German village in the sish. In the beginning the guys that are all your love interests get involved in some sort of uprising against the local lord then theres a time skip and the village is being terrorized by a troll that threatens them with ... something to be frank I dont even remember what the threat was. In order to appease the troll the entire town decides to let the protag get dragged off by him to a cottage in the middle of the woods to be his sex slave. And then suddenly she is his waifu ... it makes absolutely no sense.But what tops it off is the whole German thing. Its obviously made by someone who doesnt know that much about the German language or culture because for most of the game there are no indications of such and then occasionally its like the person who wrote it went OH CRAP I NEED SOME GERMAN STUFF IN HERE and it ends up coming off a bit like that scene from Evangelion where Shinji climbs into Unit  with Asuka I think the kicker was when the troll is trying to seduce the protag and he asks her if I were a bratwurst would you be my bun?At that point I about died laughing.

933025,0,t3_24rkbl,The idea that all VNs are porn or even that all VNs with adult content are porn is something I hear a lot. I suppose its worth considering in comparison to sex in other mediums.I used to do a lot of reading outside of visual novels not so much now just because my time feels so restricted so I pick what I enjoy most. The point though is that many of those novels written by professional authors had sex scenes and some of them were rather graphic in their imagery. Looking at more modern mediums including games movies and TV shows sex and sexual content including depictionsdescriptions of sex arent uncommon. Look at series like Game of Thrones or many moves where sex and sexually explicit content isnt uncommon. Are they porn? I would say no. In my opinion porn exists for the sole purpose of stimulating you sexually. Its there to get you off and nothing more. As some might say The plot doesnt matter.Visual novels are a medium like anything else. Are there sex scenes in every visual novel? No. What about ones where there are sex? Although you could say that many visual novels are pornographic in nature I would say that sexuality is simply a part of many but not a requirement. Its a plot device a part of the story a way to connect with characters or in some cases yes its there to just get you off. Thats if its even present. In many good visual novels it isnt and even when there are sex scenes seeing them and dismissing the entire visual novel as porn is like reading a sex scene in a book or seeing it in a movie or show and saying thats porn. Going back to what I said earlier about porn existing for the sole purpose of getting you off to classify a visual novel as porn you would need to dismiss everything else the images music and atmosphere they contribute to. You would need to dismiss story setting and characters and thus the entire universe the artists and writers have worked hard to create. Its a naive view at best and a willfully ignorant position to take at its worst one that can cause people to dismiss beautiful works of art wonderful stories and entire worlds they didnt know existed. Grisaia no Kajitsu even with its sex scenes makes for a wonderful read with its humorous representation of anime tropes. From time to time youre presented with stories which deal with troubling real world issues like drug abuse and bullying something I remember from Yume Miru Kusuri before any of its sex scenes. And what of those which dont contain sex at all? Stories like Clannad and Narcissus offer up beautiful heartmoving stories. Sometimes you laugh as you connect with characters or feel like youve lost something as you see those same characters taken from you and its amazing. Visual novels arent porn. Porn can be in the form of a visual novel but it can take many forms whether its a book movie comic or game. I dont see a book think of  Shades of Grey and then blush. I think Hey I wonder what this is actually about go look it up and make my own decisions. People should do that when they hear about visual novels.,visualnovels,chac8lf,8,t5_2r5yf

1039837,0,t3_25xyga,Since this is getting a lot of comments I might as well post here.Its cool that you guys find this interesting but honestly this post is kind of a joke  its pretty much me going through all of the VNs Ive read and deciding this would be annoying to translate for reasons XYZ and assigning a kind of arbitrary rating to them. Its probably not completely off the mark but keep in mind that its really just something I did for fun since people on IRC asked about it.Also I only had SubaHibi at top tier originally to troll vvav the translator but it didnt work Anyway when I was going back through it I ended up kind of rethinking a few positions because of the technicalpractical difficulties inherent in translating something and Im thinking a list that takes this into account across the board might be a lot more useful?interesting. For example a lot of people think that Muramasa is hard to translate because it has a vertical text box. This is in fact not the case at all. You can simply change one variable in a plain text script to make the text box display horizontally throughout the game thats it. The entire script is plain text in fact so theres no real hacking required beyond unpacking the archives  you can even simply have the game read files from directories in the same path as the exe if you want.Also with DraKoI the game is unvoiced and all of the scripts are in plain text so I was able to work around Haganeyas very terse language in places by simply commenting out all of the original formatting entirely and rewriting passages in English from the ground up something that wasnt done in Demonbane. Makoto said that if he redid Demonbanes translation now it would end up with probably around rd the lines of the original script so yeah.Kirikiri would be another engine that its possible to adddeletemerge lines in easily but something like SubaHibi for instance its a bit harder to do that with and I think thats worth taking into consideration when dealing with it. rUGP would be an extreme example. The engine isnt reversed period so the translation patch for Muvluv operates by simply hooking text on the fly and replacing it which means that theres no way to add or remove lines from a translation period.Also image editing as I mentioned with EveAmatsukaze would be another thing to take into consideration as would length in general.Im considering making a more objective version of this post would people find this interesting?,visualnovels,chmhfiq,25,t5_2r5yf

1185125,0,t1_ci2t3yc,Zero is nowhere good as dive  but thats to be expected considering dive  is one of the best vns ever made. That being said zero is still one of the better vns I played so I highly recommend it if you liked dive . The combat system is definitely more wonky in zero than dive so I found it hard to do the  hit combos in dive since the game isnt as responsive nor is it fast paced as dive. It can still be enjoyable but just dont expect the same type of experience as dive. I did enjoy the world building aspect in zero since they explain what the world outside is like outside of what I presume to be Japan like they did in dive. Most of the plot takes place in modern day Malayasia or one of those island nations in the Southeast Asia since they never specified and places emphasis on the real world rather than the net so it does play out different than dive. One thing that I dont think I will ever get used to is the fact that they changed the VA for kou but not rainlain and since you are a diehard kou fan Im sure it will bother you even more. That being said Kou isnt the focus in Zero and you only see him after halfway point into the game so it didnt really affect my enjoyment of the game all that much. My advise if you play zero is to treat it like a completely different game because it is still a very fun vn but gets overshadowed by the kamige that is dive .,visualnovels,ci2y1p1,1,t5_2r5yf

Japanesemade English English words coined in Japan is used in Japanese to refer to Japanese expressions which superficially appear to come from English but in fact do not. These words were originally borrowed loanwords deriving from English but have become so embedded into the Japanese lexicon that they are refashioned to create a novel meaning  diverging from its original intended meaning.  Some examples of waseieigo are reberu appu  level up ? which means raise a level the preposition being interpreted in line with Japanese word order as a verb qualifying its preceding object.

The EASIEST way for you would be to download a virtual machine software like virtual box VMware not free or parallels not free and run a virtual machine that someone prepared for you with the game already playable. You would only have to click on the virtual machine file and youll be able to play. The virtual machine has the benefit over boot camp that you can painlessly delete it after youre done with the game. And saya its pretty light so it will run well. For tech people Ive had several problems on OS X . like plain crash because of directX runs but doesnt display anything though the game would run you could hear the ui making noises when passing your mouse over the wine window it would only display a gray window.

1873902,0,t3_2fx82i,Ruitomo FD I only started it two days ago I havent gone passed chapter  so really cant say much about it.Soushuu Senshinkan Gakuen I started playing it since it was released on the Vita so its been like over a month or so and I believe Im only about half way through. Over the course Ive also finished quite a few games which Id rather not talk about now. Senshinkan has been progressing slowly since it didnt hook me that much. I just couldnt help but compare it to Dies irae and I felt rather disappointing. One thing I like a lot in DI is the characters but Senshinkan didnt do it for me. Most of the characters except maybe Shinno and Amakasu are rather uninteresting and lacking in charisma. Especially Senshinkan no hiyokotachi  are just flat out boring or even silly their voice acting are also pretty bad imo their interactions feel cheesy and the comedy unfunny. It seems like Masada was trying to write funny but it didnt work for me. Id rather him stick to a more serious tone. The main characters also remind me of Persona  in a bad way. The characters in P are really chuuni and its the wrong kind of chuuni. I like it better how the characters and dialogues are dealt in DI they feel more mature and just way cooler. I also felt that Senshinkan borrows too many concepts from DI the whole idea of  is pretty similar to the idea of .Despite all the rants I still think Senshinkan is a fine game and I like it just not as much as I expected to like. I guess I had my expectation too high since I really like DI a lot it also happened when I was playing KKK.

So much random panty shots that didnt really add anything to show. The panty airtime could have been better used for more dialogue. I also imagined Yuuji to be a little bit more animated then how he is portrayed in the anime.   Animation quality was decent but pretty inconsistent. I think they blew their st episode budget on Michiru.

But shes also really cute and kind. And... scary sometimes. Its a nice combination you know? Plus her outfit is awesome. Seriously it is just look at her. That long white dress that white cap those purple ribbons those boots those thigh highs which gives her a semihidden zettai ryouki look thanks to the front slit on the white dress. And then theres the billhookcleavernatawhatever you prefer calling it.She has many amazing moments in Higurashi. Many of those take place in Tsumihoroboshihen which is probably my favourite arc of the whole bunch. That arc is just perfect honestly. Theres so much emotion going through it. It feels like a culmination and resolution of all the paranoia and doubting your friendsproblems. Well at the very least Onikakushis problems. Oh and Im only talking about the VN version of it. The anime... no. Not that good in comparison. Just to name one example the junkyard scene Renas confession in it was kinda pathetic. Simply not enough emotion going into the scenes. One of the reasons it works well in the VN is because it has dais music. It sure helps a lot. But the dialogue is also more powerful in the VN.,visualnovels,clcrj2t,6,t5_2r5yf

Theyre both so long with so much going on. I have a bad feeling about those if anything. Im somewhat amazed they pushed onward with the real multiple personalities via implant story.

2281904,0,t3_2ldd0h,I guess the biggest problem writers face is when you want to write about a complicated topic but you know most people wont know much of anything about it to begin with.  Take G Senjou no Maou for example.  Kanons route involves a lot of figure skating so the novel goes in to great depth about many intricacies of the sport.  GString was both my own and my friends favorite VN ever but he didnt even read Kanons route because there was so much information he just didnt care about.  Personally I love almost all infodumping but Ive also got a weird personality where I simply enjoy learning quite literally anything that I didnt know before.  That being said I definitely still prefer when its done well in the context of the story.  If it makes the story easierpossible for your general reader to understand and its done in at least a somewhat interesting way its probably beneficial to include.

I note that on the Steam community forum for the game the developers are accepting help from volunteers to help clean it up. However Ive almost stalled on this because Ive spent my time ...Playing Sengoku Rance   I mentioned previously that I had played this partway with a walkthrough and a brief discussion occurred which had me thinking about this game again.  So Ive started playing it from the beginning this time without using a walkthrough.  Rance is still a year old males power fantasy and the VN portion is still too rapey by at least a power of  but I do like the turnbased strategyRPG aspect of the game a lot. However I tend to stink at games. Im currently stuck at one point SR spoiler s the fight where Odo first? fights Rance as Xavier but hopefully I can figure a way past this without going back too far. I do like the parts of the VN that dont relate to Rances quest to rape every princess in Japan.Restarted Sunrider  I liked the space battle game okay but even on the easy setting I had the game on I was getting bored with the space battles.

2953750,0,t3_2tzy31,Last week Ive finished Forest Overall it was an enjoyable experience.First of all I must say that it was weird. And as weird is quality of weird tends to jump up and fall down randomly. Forest had a great atmosphere and music very similar to Heroes of Might and Magic IV was extremely fitting. It had a ton of references from western literature the dialogues are smart and writing is quite elegant in style voice acting is great too. Atmosphere does the whole thing  its one of those rare cases where it really is about the journey not the destination. I liked most of the chapters but there were a few I did not like. The Game however is really a masterpiece. Cant describe it without spoilers but well if everything in Forest like that chapter that could have been a solid .Can definitely recommend it to those who want to read something fresh and original.,visualnovels,co3ut55,2,t5_2r5yf

Then this thread would be a cesspool from all the lurkers joining in which would be entertaining in its own way.I dont know why anyone would expect this to have gone any differently. Its just democracy at work. As it happens everyone voting in this contest has a vested interest due to its very nature that it is to determine the best girl a subjectively defined position. So personal preferences of the majority are going to overshadow any communityheld standards of what best girl is or should be including whether that best girl is best known as a VN character or otherwise.As for people voting for the few girls they know against girls they dont know... well its a good thing voting isnt compulsory for every matchup or it would be a lot worse. I think its unsportsmanlike to blindly vote for your preferred girl without knowing her opponent.

3023428,0,t3_2usenw,Im still reading FateStay Night and I just finished the Unlimited Blade Works route. This route has an different feeling compared to Fate. Fate started with a kind of mysterious feeling. I wanted to know who the masters are what kind of servansheroic spirits they have the true name and abilitys of the servant etc. Fate s The servants felt really strong nearly invincible and Shirou had to admit that he would never be able to beat one of them in a battle. UBW Spoilers This all changed in UBW. Since the route relied on the knowledge of Fate I already knew most of the masters etc. and it felt more battle heavy. Shirou got really strong and had enough strength to defeat the probably strongest servant in battle Archer aloneok with Rins magical energy too.Saber is my favorite character this far. The end of    spoilers Sabers routeFate really got me. I was really sad to see her die after she commited her life to save the country. It felt like  that she wasnt rewarded for all her efforts. I wish she could have stayed by Shirou at the end like in UBWs good end especially since she wanted to continue her nice dream during her last moments. This far its my favorite ending. UBWs endings are also good but they didnt feel that special to me. So now there is only Heavens Feel left. I have really high expectations for it.,visualnovels,cobdivx,4,t5_2r5yf

3257652,0,t1_coyzss0,Maybe I should have made it clearer about not reading vns in Japanese. Im not saying that you should not read it at all Im just saying dont read it to learn Japanese. If you just want to read it for fun then by all means go wild. Yes just reading textbooks can get boring and it is much more fun to read something like vns. But like I said before it cannot be a replacement for actual learning material. gtHaving a translation to compare with what I personally interpret the novel is saying is very important imo.This is a good mind set to have. It always better for you to work out those sentences yourself then compare it to the translation. Just dont look at the translation and take that as the only correct way to interpret a sentence but looks like that wont be a problem with you. What you have to understand is that no matter how good the translator is heshe cannot translate everything perfectly for every single sentence. Im sure makoto is a good translator though admittedly I never used his translations and Im sure there are other good translators out there. The problem is that once you get into the more complex sentences each translator may interpret certain sentences differently with each of them deciding differently which nuances of the sentence is important enough to stay and which ones are not. So like you said use it to compare to your own translations but do not take it as a word of God. gtI have around  ish kanji down though my grammar isnt the best. Right now Im reading some manga and looking around for VNs that satisfy the criteria here. In my opinion grammar is the most important part because kanjicompound words can always be looked up on dictionary but you cant do that with grammar. Thats just my opinion Im sure someone will disagree. Regardless even if you know  kanjis if your grammar isnt there it will be difficult to read many vns. Certainly reading vns will expose you to more type of grammar ahead of your textbook but remember that vns will not always have the standard grammar so again dont use vns as a replacement for a textbook.As for VNs that might satisfy your criteria Im sure you can try reading any of the moeges listed on the sidebar.

But thats good to see most of you are rather openminded concerning that !   My lips are sealed P Thats interesting Ill think about it a bit more but if I could ask you just one more thing  Would the VN be a multiple viewpoints one I believe that one romance would be plenty enough. Do you think so as well ?   Yeah I read a post about that not so long ago about bad endings being something people dont enjoy as much as the rest I understand that especially with romance driven VNs and drama. And you can perfectly be happy with both kinds of VN ! As a matter of fact I do love it when the true route isnt available at first in mystery novel but I would  hate it in more dramaslice of life stuff. It just wouldnt feel right for me.   The consensus seems to be that people who appreciate kinetic novels tend to appreciate long ones thats truly great !   Yeah even in the adult sciencefictionfantasy novels I work in a bookstore and take care of those sections so they are the only one I can speak of you see a loooot of teenagers perhaps because they seem to be the one that can display the more growth that can evolve the most.

I can imagine VNs much along the lines of La Jetee or Un Homme Qui Dort that would be amazing.But I wonder if the medium of VNs suits Japanese storytelling style better than Western storytelling.  Im going to go off on a limb here and speculate a bit about how I see things which even if Im completely offbase should at least be an interesting experiment in perspective different mediums handle storytelling differentJapanese cinema has produced more great directors than Japanese literature has produced great writers while for the United States it is the opposite.  Im tempted to say that this is not a coincidence and that Japanese storytelling has an advantage in film over literature as the more manipulative medium.  Well VNs have shown themselves to be an even more manipulative medium than film.Anyway Im going to predict that the first highly regarded VN say that earns more than . weighted on VNDB to come out of the West if ever will be either an experimental more artsy work or utilize a Japanese storytelling style.  In particular if it uses gritty realism and eschews narrative symmetry its going to be more experimental see links above.,visualnovels,cpggppt,3,t5_2r5yf

3605895,0,t3_31nrvy,Im going to start with two important quotes directly out of episode . The power of belief becomes magic. Those who make others believe are witches.One of the reasons Maria is never treated as a full fledged witch is that she does not make others believe in her magic. The purpose of the alliance of Mariage Sorciere is for Beato and Maria to mutually acknowledge each others magic.gtFor one thing she demands that other people respect this magic of hers even when they have no idea that it is something she cares about. It is pretty clear what happened to that unnamed servant that once badmouthed Beatrice and took a nasty spill down a staircasegtDespite Marias beliefs her Uuing only makes it harder for Rosa to accept her and the fact that she tries to act superior like that probably only makes her situation in school all the worseMagic which only you can observe is simply a delusion. It takes two the make a universe. Everyone wants someone to acknowledge them to believe in the things they believe in. If Rosa acknowledged the Uu magic then it would have worked properly but because only Maria knew its meaning it caused the opposite effect. Yasu worked to make others accept the magic of the witch because she wanted her Beato persona to be acknowledged. Being acknowledged by others is a simply way to receive fulfillment. gtKanon appeared to have been created on a whimJust as Beato was seeking acknowledgement by deepening the legend of the witch Shannon also needed acknowledgement. She did not get it from the other servants she did not get it from her employer. The only person who acknowledged her was Battler. That is why it was so painful for her when he left. He was the other half of her world. It takes two to make a universe. When Beato took away Shannons love of Battler she also took away her complete universe. Shannon no longer had anyone who would acknowledge her. Beato herself could not be the one to acknoweldge Shannon because Shannon had to forget about her love of Battler. Now that Beato held the love of Battler than means Shannon had to forget about Beato forget that she was another part of herself. The two could not acknowledge each other for doing so would acknowledge Shannons pain.People need a universe to survive.... And one person cannot create that universe alone. Two are needed. Together with Battler you created the universe of that bud of love....Now that one half of that pair is gone your universe has crumbled...People cannot create a universe on their own.Then you must create a new universe with someone else....I will give you that person....A creature to bury the pain of your heart and heal you....he will not betray you...Yes let it be a sibling.... I will give you a little brother.Yasu did not create Kanon on a whim but out of necessity. No one would acknowledge Shannon so she created another personality who would acknowledge her. The two would acknowledge each other and Yasu would form a universe within herself.Kanons role was to accept all of Shannons pain and grief and support her. He was a being made out of necessity and he took the dirty parts of Shannon to keep her pure. He took her anger her despair her disgust with herself. He took her selfloathing. This is why Kanon felt he was not worthy of love. His role was to support Shannon until she found someone else to make a universe with. But at the same time when she found that someone else he would no longer be needed. He would constantly warn Shannon that her relationships would fail remind her of her flaws both physical and emotional. Beato took the love of Battler that was causing the pain and Kanon took the selfloathing and grief that Shannon had. The two of them worked to keep Shannon as the ideal servant she was supposed to be but at the same time had their own desires and did not want to simply dissapear when Shannons universe no longer needed them.However there is a form of magic much greater than regular magic which requires a second person to acknowledge it. That is what the golden truth is. The golden truth is a personal truth one which no one can shake one which only you yourself need acknowledge. Some could call it delusion others would call it faith. Most people have such beliefs even if they do not realize it. A religious persons belief in god would be a golden truth. Love can be a golden truth. Even if someone does not acknowledge your love they cannot destroy it as long as you hold firm. Ange reaches the golden truth at the end of her journey and is capable of creating a universe all on her own. She is able to believe in the good in her family members and believe that they are always watching over her wishing for her happiness.,visualnovels,cq3aqjf,7,t5_2r5yf

3608022,0,t3_31ookp,gt.Do you feel that the archetypical visual novel even if only hypothetical is closer to a book or a game?I typically think of them as their own medium distinct from both games and books. If I were forced to pick one however Id probably say theyre closer to books than games.gt.Do you feel that visual novels could be included under the umbrella term interactive fiction?In the traditional sense of the term Im not sure that visual novels could be considered IF. Even in particularly choiceheavy titles Visual Novels tend to be quite a passive reading experience. Though thats just my general opinion. There are in fact plenty of titles which I could describe as being more in the style of interactive fiction  including the Thief amp Sword series or even something like Analogue A Hate Story. I think those are the exception that proves the rule however.gt.Would you prefer to continue purchasingselling OELVNs from undedicated services such as Steam or a dedicated storefront? This storefront would serve as both a point of sale and a publishing house.The convenience of a more general service like Steam is definitely something I enjoy but a more dedicated storefront would definitely have its appeal too. Assuming that such a storefront would be a place to buy any visual novel products and not just those of a single developer or localization company I could definitely see myself making use of such a service.gt.What do you think can be done to improve the reputation of visual novels in the West?Make more and translate more. One of the many benefits that something like the manga or anime industry has had over the visual novel industry is the relative ease with which content can be produced and shared among western audiences. Manga scanlations dont require hundreds and thousands of manhours to produce allowing for a much wider variety of translated works available and therefore the potential market is orders of magnitude larger.With regards to OELVNs specifically its an incredibly young medium outside of Japan and were still learning how to make them without relying too heavily on the tropes of the Japanese VNs. With practice and experience I think western producers are going to find the balance and learn how to make titles that speak to their audiences by developing their own style that isnt just aping Japanese culture. I dont think were there yet but theres no reason why we cant.,visualnovels,cq3jh15,3,t5_2r5yf

4683484,0,t3_3f2kmb,I have finished Narcissu and currently reading White Album  and Katawa ShoujoNarcissu NarcissuThis is my first vn and i am loving it the story is really thought provoking the music is really good when accompanied by the text and the character is really interesting Narcissu spoilers I havent dealt with a lot of people that is about to die. I only have one close relative that has died and it was peaceful. I didnt really cry then cause i was small and dont really understand the idea of death. This vn tho however made me wonder what is it that drive me to continue and live? I am still seeking the answer but i guess for now the answer is if i live great things can happen.The only thing i didnt like was the animation and the lack of pictures of our main female lead its not that great of a problem but i really hate to see something that good have such a clear flaw.Also i really like Narcissu spoilers the layout of the story first introducing the female lead as a lonely kundere maybe not dere i dont know. And then further expanding her story and background is slide two making the actions that seems weird in the first story more logical and understandableKatawa Shoujo Katawa ShoujoCurrently reading it i am only on the first chapter so i dont really know much about it but constantly hearing praise for it. I really like the introduction to our main character although it kind of sound cliche i maybe wrong i am not that familiar with VNs anyway. katawa shoujo characters rants i really really hate the two girls that one is deaf and the one that does sign language to translate. They seem idk too trollish for my taste. And i dont know why but their character design kinds of puts me off. I hope they will develop a bit more to my liking Also i really like the  s the burnt on face girl and  s the blind half western girli have not gotten to their backstory yet but i feel like i will like her gut feeling i guess.White Album  WA Introductory ChapterHaha finally to my favorite of all time i present you White Album . I am currently still on Introductory chapter but i know most of the stuff that is going to happen because i watched the anime and it is one hell of a masterpiece imo. The one thing i find strange in the vn is that touma seems a bit more trollish i dont mid her being trollish tho cause it is her character. But then i actually is moving towards neutral to liking her because Anime and introductory chapter spoilers There is so fucking many situation where she could have confessed to Haruki and gotten him yet setsuna went first. Also Touma kissed Haruki in the anime after the festival yet she didnt fucking acted on it. I at least count  opportunity for a perfect confession yet her own indecisiveness is holding her back Okay rant over the only thing i think the anime did better is the Spoilers festival itself and the singing animation by setsuna. Well it is a vn i shouldnt expect any animation being done but with anime watched first it really enhances the experience of the VN. To conclude i really really like WA as an anime i am liking the VN so far too. Cant wait to get to closing chapter Spoiler?s where more suffering is inclined.,visualnovels,ctkwdps,4,t5_2r5yf

4755416,0,t1_cttxtch,gtAfter that tho things get nuanced. The anonymous TL here clearly is trying hard to preserve the flashy ornate style of writing that is characteristic of the chuuni genre. It goes to lengths to add additional words and sentence connetions and swapping around the ordering of clauses to make it work. Its far from literal because it strives for instilling a similar effect instead of similar meaning.This part is exactly what Im trying to convey. To quote a previous comment of minegtWhen translating youre not just taking one piece of text and mechanically converting it to another language its important that the translator notes the cultural subtleties of the source text and converts it into the target language while maintaining the same impact. To do this the TL has to make a judgement based on his familiarity with the target language and the target audience.gtIf for example a really Japanese joke would most likely fly over the targets heads wouldnt it be counterproductive to do a wordforword translation? It would make more sense to take liberties at this point and that is what makes the translators familiarity with the target language and audience the special sauce. At the same time balance is important. Underlocalise something and youll end up with an rickety unpleasant read. Overlocalise something and youll end up with a Kids version of a VN.gtThis is why machine translations are terrible. This is why there arent many good translations as very specialised and hence rare individuals are needed. This is why its important to have a set market in mind before embarking on a translation project.,visualnovels,cttyrua,9,t5_2r5yf

While I did play the VN after watching the anime Id watched the anime about three years before so I didnt remember many of the major plot points. However I would recommend it regardless since one of the best parts of SteinsGate was Okabes development throughout the course of the game. While the anime serves its purpose well because youre observing the story from a third person perspective you dont really feel Okabes struggle and the exhaustion he feels from the excessive time leaping as well as you do in the VN. Hes an interesting character and being able to get inside his head really adds to it. As well as that the VN affected me emotionally far more than the anime did even after multiple playthroughs. Also I would say that the extra endings are worth experiencing along with the pain that accompanies making the decision to undo the dmails which the anime also doesnt capture as well. To sum up the VNs definitely worth it.,visualnovels,cu2yr5t,2,t5_2r5yf

I know its kind of a long shot but I was keeping saves from the end of every chapters so I figured somebody might have been doing the same. My scores however are probably lost forever I think they were like  million or so.Thanks!EDIT Disregard this! The issue had nothing to do with Japanese save states! Turns out the save states English save states that is  unpatched states are and as such are not affected are stored offsite not in the application folder itself. I was running the game on a Windows virtual machine that I had to reinstall after it crashed last night. Once I recovered the files from the old VM the saves and my score! were all restored no problem!While Im here though may as well throw a question out to everyone who has played RGD  do you still have your final scores for the game?

5045378,0,t1_cutlb0k,Scores in a vacuum are kind of dumb because they dont really represent anything and lots of people rate in a really inflated way. The only way to actual value scores is to see how its compared to other works. Especially with something like Dies Irae where it was rated  by lots of people because of Also Sprach Zarathustra which granted it is an exception but ratings dont really tell much at all. If though one were to determine what the best source for displaying reasonable trends EGS is probably the best bet since the basis of comparison is the actual writing itself by the respective authors.  On the topic of Kamige I pretty much agree with you since its pretty arbitrary but if I experience a game that is far above and beyond that stands head and shoulders above other works Id understand why people would call it a Kamige.,visualnovels,cuu5rbo,2,t5_2r5yf

5081384,0,t1_cuy66pr,Watched two more series last week after that great list of recommendations from you all!Usagi DropThis one really blew me away.  There were only one or two episodes where I didnt cry.  It was so nice to see raw goodness still exists in this world  sometimes I need a reminder Ive always maintained that children are just tiny adults that lack experience and the kids in this show were just amazing.  Apparently they were voiced by actual kids?  Thats always more difficult but I think the payoff is worth it  Hey Arnold and Adventure Time were definitely the better for using young talent.Unless we can figure out this whole gene therapy thing in the next ten to fifteen years I dont ever plan on having biological children  Im going to adopt.  Rin and Daikichis relationship was especially meaningful to me.ToradoraIll admit Im deeply biased against the genre.  I abhor a lovetriangle and a lovedodecahedron is only marginally more palatable.  Even so I found the series pretty enjoyable especially when the complexity of the plot significantly increased in the second half.I never thought I wanted a husbando but Ryuuji is now my husbando.  Yall cant have him!What really surprised me was how my opinion of each character was always increasing.  Toradoras Especially how quickly Ami became so relateable after that disastrous introduction.  Usually I find my patience thinning over time.One thing I didnt get  Toradora questions What did Minori see in Ryuuji?  Ami and Taiga both had good reason to pursue him over all others but I dont think Minoris obstinance was explained very well.,visualnovels,cuyhzu1,5,t5_2r5yf
5084112,0,t1_cuyob49, Relationship Development Furthering plot pointsI dont personally see the appeal to jacking off to anime characters likely because I have a low sex drive and only seek to have sex with my partner  or  times a week. Hscenes are undoubtedly there for masturbation material especially with the VN in question. However making love to someone signifies a lot within a relationship to some people  and that can be said about the characters within a VN. Not only this sex can be used as a plot point within a story there are multiple examples I might post a bit later but Im sure youre getting my drift here.

5126357,0,t3_3l7oh9,Hey guys! Ive been lurking this sub for quite a while and just now felt like posting.I started Rewrite this past week and Im still in the common route on the part right after Kotarou goes to Forest. Its been almost  SoL so far and sadly I find that Rewrite kinda drags a bit when its not being funny which fortunately is something that I think it is pretty decent at Id say it hits me about  of the time. The comedy is particularly good when there are a bunch of characters together instead of oneonone conversations between Kotarou and someone else since the characters personalities all play off each other quite well so everyones incorporation into the Occult Research Club really did well for my enjoyment.Rewrite also has quite a likeable main cast so far. My brief first impressions on each of them are as followsKotarou  A pretty decent protagonist so far. He says some pretty hilarious stuff once in a while and his superpowers are pretty intriguing. Speaking of which Im still wondering what that clocklike thing on the lower left part of the screen has to do with it.Kotori  Kotori is a really cool and funny girl with a pretty amusing way of speaking. I have no idea why she ended up being a loner in class because I would totally dig having a friend like Kotori in real life. I guess their whole class is composed of tools or something. Her healing punch thing is probably my favorite gag in this so far.Chihaya  Initially really liked her because of her mildly antagonistic relationship with Kotarou Chris is my favorite in Majikoi and because I like her school uniform. Over time I found myself liking her less and less for some reason. Probably because she feels like an exhausting type of person to be with.Shizuru  Initially didnt like her since Im not really a fan of her type of character but she seems to end up being pretty funny when combined with the other members of the cast.Akane  I often like smug characters so shes pretty cool in my eyes. I also like her VA the best among all of the heroines.Lucia  Probably my favorite of the heroines so far. She does antagonistic better than Chihaya and her overreactions are fun. Her dark hair is also pretty refreshing to see considering all of the light colored hair and school uniforms that are in this thing.Yoshino  A pretty hitandmiss guy. On one hand Kotarou messing with his chuuni tendencies usually ends up being pretty amusing. On the other hand you cant really have a normal conversation with the guy so his scenes can be pretty tiring sometimes. Like in Shizurus case I like him better when there are other characters with him aside from Kotarou.Sakuya  This guy is kind of dick. Not sure whether it is in a good or bad way.Esaka  No opinion of this guy so far except that his selftsukkomis are hilarious.Overall I guess I could say that I like Rewrite so far. Im looking forward to when the plot kicks into gear although so far I still have no idea what its going to be about aside from that environmentalism is probably going to be a major theme.,visualnovels,cv3x2h5,10,t5_2r5yf

5257603,0,t3_3n0d1s,I finished reading MLU There wasnt a lot left to read from where I reached in my previous post and my Google Doc is updated with the rest of the information anyway.  But for completeness there were two main segments left MLUs the disaster relief mission and the Christmas party  epilogue.  First segments I had some extremely strong objections to this part. Meiya was acting with an incredible and highly uncharacteristic lack of responsibility. Meiya more than anyone should understand how the chain of command works. If the TSFs were equivalent to US Navy ships Meiyas infractions were so severe that she stood a realistic chance of being sentenced to death. Hell even Takeru could have been. And maybe Yuuko can pull a lot of strings for Takeru but Meiya doesnt really know that. Its great that Meiya is such a caring and considerate person but she should really know better or at least utilize her vast personal influence legally somehow. I was not happy by that part.  Second segments The second segment was pretty hard to read. It was done quite well and I felt pretty uncomfortable with anxiety for much of it. It was done nicely but theres not much more I can say about it. It was fairly abrupt.  Past that the route structure of MLU was kind of disappointing. I did not expect MLUs literally the exact same scenario every single time.  Having finished MLU I am now reading MLA I also have a separate Google Doc for it.  I think Im about  hours in now. And what can I say... its a good VN but it also has some unexpected weak points. In particular I am very unhappy with MLA major spoilerss the VNs approach to its science fiction part. Given how little attention is given to the matter of TSFs and how they are powered Kasumis abilities dimensionhopping will power and time travel. Basically if you want to be hard science fiction then please try to use sortof meaningful scientific explanations and go as deep as you want. If you want to be soft science fiction and just handwave everything please dont dwell on it with endlessly long explanations. Ive started treating it as Yuuko intentionally giving Takeru unrealistically optimistic explanations in order to make sure he stays on board with her project  or in other words half the time shes just lying through her teeth about the science bits. This isnt fully consistent with Yuukos bluntness but its the best I can do.  Past that however this is certainly a very engaging and interesting VN. I probably have yet to reach the parts that make it so highly praised but its still quite interesting and fun. I really am glad I took my time reading MLE and MLU even though not all of the routes in MLE actually seem to play into this.  Watching Takeru MLAs going through his basic training and constantly showboating was incredibly annoying to me but its really just Takeru being Takeru. Cant help it  sometimes the protagonist is a bit of an ass.I also spent far too much time and energy trying to figure out MLAs what the deal with Kasumi is. Since I know Sumika is going to end up with an Eishi suit judging by cover work plus a few things I unfortunately overheard Ive been trying to find out just how Sumika enters this world pretty much as soon as the novel started. Most of my speculation can be read in the doc and I freely admit that it gets ridiculous at times. Well this is why even tiny spoilers can be problematic when they change your expectations in small ways. One might even say that theres a bit of a butterfly effect.  By the way I am currently just at the beginning of MLAs episode  which is where Takeru hears about the mountain valley being evacuated and gets into a small fight with Meiya about it.  I really have a lot of thoughts about this VN but Im not sure how to write them out. Its all in the doc I guess unless theres something someone wants me to elaborate on.,visualnovels,cvjq9hj,5,t5_2r5yf

Keep in mind that  year of college Japanese courses is something like hrs of study time.  Can a low budget game pack in anywhere near that level of content?  My guess is no.  A game like this might have hrs of content.  Its better than nothing but only by a little bit. year of Japanese was enough to set me up to succeed with text hooking.

5323945,0,t1_cvs4rka,The reason the dialogue and the scene is poor as an attack is because like said its overly preachy and circular. She essentially spends  minutes saying the same thing over and over again which is basically of just a repeat of saying that she shouldnt like it but she did and doesnt that make her a horrible person. If you want to give a message the worst thing you can do is come across as lecturing the opposing party. No ones likely to listen if they feel like they are just being attacked. An example of a similar scene that paints perhaps what the author wanted to convey which is making you feel bad for a character being put through this and considering them a human rather than fetish fuel is in Berserk. No words are really given only the reactions of the characters and the setup of the scene. Hence its much more powerful and the message is basically the same. The reason is the bigger problem was of course the  unit and Sumika are not the same person as Sumika is dead because of Yuuko. Shes just forced to experience problems and emotions that arent her own because of memories she was given. The reason I felt like the scene was a bit of a cop out was because Takeru just decided that they share the same heart so theyre clearly the same person to him no matter where they are. Of course Takeru says he doesnt give a shit but it felt like a thoughtless approach and almost emotionally manipulative. I just felt the issue of her being Sumika but not at the same time was a much more interesting angle to tackle then random tentacle rape. ,visualnovels,cvs729l,1,t5_2r5yf

I read the Amaterasu translation of CROSSCHANNEL and unsurprisingly there were no hints of Romeo Tanakas greatness anywhere.

5369338,0,t3_3okdis,I only finished Unlimited by now so I still have to go through the actual great novel . From this standpoint though I kind of wonder how to fit these into an anime. I know you said that it doesnt matter but I actually think it does. Lets take ChaosHead for example. I watched the anime and thought it was absolute garbage. For this reason I didnt even remotely consider to look at the novel because based on the anime I thought it would just be full of harem clichs and a stupid storyline. People who dont know the medium might even judge the medium as a whole as that. Only after hearing about the actual novel from readers did I start to think well this might actually be something for me. But the anime still lingers in my head saying you will waste your time!.I guess they would have to rush through Extra and Unlimited. As far as I have heard all the details of those are supposed to be important for Alternative though. I can only imagine something like an  episode summary of Extra ending in Takeru waking up followed by about  episodes of Unlimited similar to Full Metal Jacket. Two issues I would see with that approach . Extra will do a great job of scaring away many potential viewers. Perhaps it would need some kind of oh so deep intro to show that this perfectworldscenario is only temporary. . If all details are important there would be much missing with such an approach. I cant really imagine giving the mediocre buildup novels much more screen time though although character building is quite important and can hardly be done by rushing through the story. I dont know how it is in Alternative but I guess they would have to move some character buildup from those games into the Alternative storyline or something like that.It just seems to me like there is much more to consider than in Fate or SteinsGate since the story is not as straightforward. Which is really hard to solve in the limited time. SteinsGate did do a great job with the adaptation but there was really not much room left for more content and they already had to shorten some meaningful scenes a lot.That being said I dont necessarily think that it would have such a huge impact on visual novels. It didnt seem to me like people were convinced of the format after watching SteinsGate either  they just liked the anime and thats it. Your dream of seeing more opinions about your favorite novel is understandable but it could also be the opposite Bad adaptation and everyone will answer lol wtf is this shit its like a new twist every two seconds and nothing makes sense  quite the opposite of what you are hoping for. All you can do is being one of the Its much better in the novel!squad but it wont change anyones opinion. So yeah I think the quality of an adaptation is quite important. And I can certainly understand that noone dared to try that by now since the concept of the story seems to be to build up a cringeworthy happyhippo scenario only to take everything away relentlessly. Without all the hype in the VN community though I dont think many people would have touched Alternative either after reading the first novels. Its just a risky concept as a whole,visualnovels,cvxzria,1,t5_2r5yf
5384049,0,t3_3orkdm,CrossChannelBefore anyone asks no I am not using any patch so my experience may be very different than most peoples. Im currently right before the hscene with Misato I skipped a little bit ahead to see where Im at and other than a few things I think this is pretty great. The characters are pretty interesting with their own strange quirks so there is never a dull moment. However the highlight of the vn would be Romeos humor which is by far the most bizarre thing I have seen yet in vns. I have no idea how lines like this were translated but he sure can write up some strange jokes. Since Im not that far in I have no idea which direction the vn will go but it seems that the spoilerss timeloop aspect is not even considered a spoiler and the plot is not why its considered a great vn so I am looking forward to what will come in the later parts. Oh and Taichi is one of the horniest characters ive come across in all of vns. I have no idea how the heroines tolerate him but maybe that will come up later. I also read some of amnesia Not much to say for now other than Ikki is  husbando material. Its pretty nice to play in p since Ive only come across  vns that play at the resolution.

5403559,0,t3_3p1jik,Yeah. This has already been brought up a bit in the Philosophical Musings thread but Umineko absolutely had a lasting impact on me being more patient with people. I think people consider the golden rule to be a good measure of respect but I think it takes a great deal more composure to flip things around and force you and the other person to see things from another perspective and open up.  I think it can be very hard to appreciate that for most people you meet youre essentially getting a truncated view of this person youre not often getting a full range of experiences and motivations that let you empathise with them or gleaning things that necessarily let you bond. People have fleeting emotions or even rationales people do things they regret sometimes people make very grave mistakes but dont regret them and sometimes that is ok.I think where Umineko excelled at that was its cast several of whom were involved in scenes that were adorable and scenes that were very very hard to read.Without love it cannot be seen meant a ton of different stuff in Umineko but one thing it absolutely meant is that if you dont take the time to care about a persons complexity you will never see the real person. I think thats an important thing to keep close to your heart. Its simple its not a.lifechanging idea but its a story that perfectly reinforced it and for me really made it personally click.,visualnovels,cw2d4zv,11,t5_2r5yf

If you choose to pull out the game tells you that you tried but were too late and you cum inside anyway.  Girl gets pregnant.  Rest of the game is actually you having to deal with a teenage pregnancy.  You have to decide whether to stick it out with herand choosing not to gets you sued for child support etc whether to try to convince her to loosekeep it.  At one point you might get the option to try to push her down the stairs for a very bad end.  The only good ends would be if you suck it up and take responsibility.  ,visualnovels,cw6evt3,1,t5_2r5yf

The western VN ecosystem is in a much better place these days but its still not very stable. The stock of highly popular VNs that have withstood the test of time is being gauged at an incredible rate. What happens when it depletes? Fan translators need to be around if the VN localization industry collapses.

Overall Fate felt more tropey. But I liked the development of Saber. Her and Rin are probably my favorite characters overall in the VN. I also dragged a bit on reading HF.

6338921,0,t3_42gmjc,Okay here goes my question.I played this visual noveldating sim years ago and I forgot almost all about it. Maybe someone could figure out what was it? Here is what I remember. the main character was a guy. he was romancing a few girls one of which had light pink hair and another girl had rather short bright green hair. He had to raise his stats and call the girl out as its usual. it was possible to go out to town. Based on where the character went it triggered various encounters. It was not town as in a couple of pictures and pick a place you could actually control the character with arrows. It was a D town with a few rows of houses and roads looked a bit like something out of RPG Maker. the art looked kind of old so Im assuming it has been made earlier than s. I vaguely remember some magicdark stuff going on. I think some of the characters were monsters or demons or succubus perhaps.

6340519,0,t3_42h5dr,The logic behind having it for tiers  is doing my head in. Assuming they get barely funded k is still only the k required for the PC port which was probably I assume costed before considering the Vita port. Tiers with physical rewards will incur additional costs for production so if they want as much of the k to count towards the Vita port as possible wouldnt having more funding from digital only tiers be better? Has the cost PC port been reduced somehow? Or is there some magical accounting trick at work?Also they say that other kickstarters have the Vita goal at k funding which is just ridiculous since only two VN kickstarters have gotten above that. The amount that matters is the additional funding needed anyways. Sure the MuvLuv goal was at k but it was only an additional k stretch goal is for two games and includes an Android port as well. Granted the MuvLuv port will probably be simpler as well since they probably kept an English version in mind whilst they made the Jap port. In comparison Libra wanted an additional k for Vita and Android ports whilst Grisaia asked for k although I wouldnt be surprised if the latter has costed more due to all the issues around it.,visualnovels,czachjy,4,t5_2r5yf

Im not sure exactly when it happened or what set it off.s They switched perspectives a LOT. I dont mind it once and a while but they do it like  or  times and it never adds anything. You see the scene from the MCs perspective it switches to Hinatas and then.. yup thats about what I expected her to be thinking at this point. No new information is presented its just padding the word count.s The drama in the route revolves around token best friend guy confronting you about whether youre the real Shuri. At first you play it cool because thats your job but eventually he figures it out and says it to your face youre not Shuri. So what do you do now? You continue denying it of course! Wait thats a lie you stop denying it you just dont say anything at all and stand there in awkward silence completely confirming it. I mean I could kind of understand if the guy confronting you was an enemy but hes your token male best friend. We just spent an entire common route being buddies. Why do we suddenly mistrust him? Heck the cats already out of the bag anyways and hes obviously not telling anyone he just wants the truth. It takes a whole bunch of stupid pointless agonizing dialogue for the protagonist to realize OH YEAH these are my friends and if I tell them to keep it secret they will! Mindblowing.s I feel like this is more subjective but the puppy love thing was as unromantic as possible. They were like a couple of  year olds with the way they were completely unable to realize their own feelings nor communicate them to their partner. The playful dialogue they had before was basically gone in favor of awkward silences and excessive blushing.s I skipped through to the end but I was at least kind of paying attention. The drama in the last part of the route seemed to revolve around Hinatas grandfather threatening the MC but it all ends up resolved because haha I was just testing you see there was no riveting drama to be found here had you going didnt I.,visualnovels,d01gtd7,1,t5_2r5yf

Its a darn shame that we alienate the muh porn!! the dicking is part of the plot I swear! crowd who will have to wait for a patch. I wish Steam could change their policy outright but even so the current MangaGamer issue with the CD keys is pretty shitty so I dont know what to really say.Maybe we really do need that platform the guy was talking about an eroge Steamlike platform.

6649942,0,t3_46luvz,So yeah as Kindred Spirits on the Rooftop has been my sole sustenance for these previous weeks Ive felt compelled to revisit my stockpile of yuri manga to bask in this sweet flowerbed full of yuri. Anyone who has any recommendations of good mangaanimeor other medium of yuri that they want to provide feel free to post them here.For myself Ill list the manga that Ive read and liked here not in any particular orderHuskey and Medley  pretty famous on its own actually. did you know theres a vocaloid song which was composed as an homage to this story?Girl Friends  classic as hell and thats actually the greatest compliment I can give. I read it thinking itd be a lighthearted introductorymaterial shoujo and I was met with shoujoai yuri before I figured out what I had really bargained for. Thank goodness I didnt stop myself from finishing it PSisterism  this may be one of the weirdest manga that I have ever encountered in my life. And its also one of the most hilarious ones too. Just ordinary days showering love upon your friends little sister. Perfectly ordinary.Ayame to Amane  youll finish all the available chapters under  minutes.  minutes wellwasted I guarantee.Ebisusan and Hoteisan  a more realistically portrayed or emotionally mellifluous? Idk how to describe this well story. One of those I hate her guts gt Why cant I get her out of my head? story that has a sweeter ending and a good leadup to the protagonists realization of her love.Honto no Kanojo  pretty hyper moefied one here. Its cute. So it works.Futari to Futari  by the same author who wrote Sisterism above. I really love how this author opens up hisher characters dialogues. Like how they act and behave all manages to seem so trivial and prosaic but how the content of their conversations are so overthetop weird. It works just so well in my mind.Kimi Koi Limit  downtoearth. Drama. Realistic. An ingenue doing what she always does to stir up trouble. The drawings simplistic but it works well and its really calming to look at it for some reason.I Love You  oneshot. More of a tragedy story than the lilypetalsbloomingeverywhere like the majority of manga above. I like this one because of the display of genuine human emotion i.e. selfsacrifice concealed beneath the surreal plotline. A share of tragedy drops your spirits too but in a comforting melancholy way that depresses you just enough to be contemplative dA Secret on the Lips  oneshot. Adorable.Edit Almost forgot to include Octave surely the best yuri manga that I have read up to date. This ones woven in the similar thread as Yurireisan I think except with more adult drama mixed in. Nevertheless this manga just gives life to reallife romance so satisfyingly perfectly. Even if you are not in for yuri and take it out of the equation itll still be awesome.,visualnovels,d075trj,1,t5_2r5yf

Not so long ago I was once again searching for porn games someone in a reddit post suggested Katawa Shoujo but all the replies he got was variations of Oh my god the feels thats not a porn game! it got me curious so since it was free I tried it out and it got me hooked. Ive put hundreds of houres into visual novels since.Its kind of funny that both my first times I was looking for a porn game because once visual novels became a hobby I became the kind of person who skips past the HScenes.

6949262,0,t1_d13z50x,gt If you didnt feel connected to him before then clearly the writer wasnt doing his job on crafting a believable character beforehand.Id say its good writing to slowly turn a generic oblivious harem romance protag into the fantastic protag he becomes.  I felt connected to him at the start of Unlimited this was simply an example of them doing a good job making me feel the way the protag felt.gt Marimo had always been written as the perceptive characterI did not get this from her character at all.  She was always kind and wise due to her experience but perceptive?  Not really.  Besides knowing about the Soldier class doesnt mean that youre automatically immune to all surprises.  She thought they were all cleaned up.  Everyone did.  People make mistakes even Marimo.gt  it could hardly be considered Takerus fault.In your opinion maybe.  But there are plenty of perfectly reasonable reasons for Takeru to feel responsible for her death.  I dont know what it is about Marimo that makes you think shes immune to being taken by surprise.gt you cant just transition between tones at the drop of a hatI dont remember seeing this carved in stone anywhere.  In any case it wasnt at the drop of a hat.  The tone starts lighthearted in Extra gets more serious in Unlimited gets even more serious during the coup and this is the point where the tone becomes very serious.  Even in this point after Chomp you have a good hour or two of nothing but psychological plotrelated stuff going on as a transition its hardly as if theres suddenly gore every  scenes afterwards.  Its not shoved in your face.  Its a single episode of a traumatizing scene that goes on to have a very deep psychological effect on Takerus personality and perspective.  That one incident catalyzes a lot of changes in his attitude towards the world and the people hes around.  And they dont milk the flashback for longer than necessary it stops as soon as Takeru gets a grip.  If they hadnt shown the graphic nature of the scene it would have created a disconnect between the player and the character.  Hed be traumatized and the player wouldnt feel a thing because hed been protected from the unpleasant reality.  The point of the scene is that the player and Takeru go through the same thing not only does something theyre close to die but they do so in a horrific way and the memory of that event haunts both.gt if you want to have a Dark story put some dark content in the first couple of hours.Then I guess Muv Luv isnt for you as a major premise of the game is genre shift.

Yes Im sure all the Japanese text will be replaced with English including the narrated segments.  Also the Japanese version will get a hardcopy release in Japan probably with the usual set of extras.In addition they didnt rule out that the version on Steam will have an option for English or Japanese text.

6956262,0,t1_d14la18,The main character brutally dies in Chrono Trigger. Theres the constant threat of a doomed world looming over the entire game. It is not always rather lighthearted. The entire arc involving Zeal has almost nothing lighthearted about it. The last few books in Harry Potter are not lighthearted at almost any moment let alone always. At the end of Mother  you get sent back in time to abort the baby version of the embodiment of all evil. It is not lighthearted. While I hate bringing up arguments like this it honestly just seems like you dont understand the role of tone shifts. The fact that youve brought up alienating the audience again speaks to that point. The intention of writing can be to make the reader uncomfortable or to alienate readers.

7030689,0,t3_4bxk6y,Im going on a rpg nostalgia trip. I started with Chrono Trigger since I never encountered the game during my childhood but Chrono Cross was one of the most memorable games for me. I cant remember the exact details but I can still recall the feelings of frustration when I get stuck in a chapter and just roaming around the world then discovering you can use your items anytime in the game that might interact with the world. My biggest frustration was I never played the entire story since I was playing left the cd over at my cousins who lived out of town and when I got back they already finished the fucking game cant blame them though the itch mustve been real. So now here I am taking the trail once again but now Im older have more RPG experience and can now google walkthrougs.Just finished Chrono Triggers  endings man this game is so rich there is no longer any doubt why its cemented in legendary status. Cross chronological story telling is really one of my favorites the way all things are interconnected and consequential really tingles my fancies. The feeling of going back in forth from past  present  future to see things you loved become different or destroyed sends me goosebumps everytime this is where premium genuine top tier feels at. Wanted to add this In comparison to my last RPG Legend of Heroes Trails in The sky BTW Thirc Chapter is confirmed! Chrono series wins overall in the lore and story telling of its world whereas LoH has always been about its personal and memorable heroes. World building is definitely superior in LoH Tits The older LoH games were great too since it revolves around conversations and relationships whereas Chrono focuses on events to move the plot. I guess the  are really different but both make up the pillars of the RPG genre the focus slightly varies though it may be because of the games age as well. ,visualnovels,d1da6zf,4,t5_2r5yf

7133094,0,t3_4d703u,I always liked Isono and his split personalities. With him pretty much just being a weird character talking to fairies and hitting on Toukas mom for the majority of the story and then they reveal that he was able to escape punishment for participating in the rebellion by faking his own insanity. At the same time he was making preparations to fight again by gathering information and even rebuilt Kens house while everyone else thought he was insane. He is definitely an underappreciated character in this VN but I guess he is a bit overshadowed by Houzuki and Ken. Also helps that Sharin no Kuni didnt have any annoying heroines at least to me anyway. Which is why it is one of the more memorable visual novels I have finished.,visualnovels,d1oyc6k,5,t5_2r5yf

7244278,0,t3_4ene9y,Higurashi no Naku Koro ni KaiI got a fullish night of sleep for the first time in a week last night because I finally finished Higurashi!  As before my sections below were written between chapters so you can see my thought processes as I progressed instead of what I think looking back.TSUMIHOROBOSHII wont really go into too much specific detail on the events of this chapter but I do want to say something about the overall flow of the chapter. Tsumihoroboshis I really like the way Ryuukishi writes a descent into madness.  It does follow a very logical progression from the victims viewpoint.  After Rena was ensnared by Takanos theory she made a sequence of relatively small leaps in logic that ultimately allowed everything to get blown into a completely ridiculous mindset.  Takano was brilliant because a lot of what she said had some basis in fact but made an initial assumption that was then propped up by a series of facts when viewed with that initial assumption in mind.  We got to see Rena doing that herself with all the events she witnessed but only heard snippets of conversation or didnt have the full story and so she interpreted that in a way that best supported her theory.  Keiichi even calls her out on it at one point but shes too far gone to snap out of it then.  What I especially liked about the writing for all this is that the reader was given the proper context of events before Rena made her misunderstandings so we could watch her descent in all its terrible glory.  The shift in text color from pink to red for Rena as she slowly lost it was a nice touch.  Im not sure if it was a gradual change but I know I only realized it after the text was fully red and she was completely lost in her delusion.Tsumihoroboshis I was really glad that Rena managed to achieve her salvation at the end of this arc.  Unlike Keiichi in Onikakushi Rena was pulled out of her madness in her battle with Keiichi and so will not have to live with it unresolved if she remembers it in a future cycle.  The fact that Keiichi was able to remember his other selfs actions really makes me wonder how it will play into my prediction of a Groundhog Day style time loop.  Ill elaborate on that aspect further down.  I wondering if this chapter would do any explanation of the events of Onikakushi and was glad to have Keiichis realization of the truth of the events so we could see just what an unreliable narrator he really was at that time.  I am hoping for the same treatment of Tatarigoroshi in the next chapter because that still brings up some major questions.  Keiichi mad some allusions to the events of that chapter as well but it didnt receive the same treatment.Tsumihoroboshis Higurashi in general likes to draw parallels to its many events.  There were a ton of commonalities between Rena and Keiichi from Onikakushi throughout.  Renas thoughts of how to dispose of the bodies of Rina and Teppei were very reminiscent of the dam managers murder.  Renas and Shions respective conversations with Takano in the library were very similar but Renas went further since she had information of her own to contribute instead of merely having things explained to her by Takano.  We also finally got to see an explanation of what would cause Tomitake to claw out his own throat in all of his deaths.My personal theories up to this points In my past posts Ive not been shy about my theory that there is some kind of loop a Groundhog Day scenario albeit longer than a day taking place here with Rika at the center of it.  The way I see it Tsumihoroboshi all but confirms this.  I am certain there is either a loop or perhaps multiple realities taking place.  I briefly entertained the multiple realities notion as explaining part of Tatarigoroshi but Im leaning towards the loop.  I am inclined to extend that to Ooishi as he seems to know that Tomitake always dies in the same manner every time.  He like Rika also referred to it as a maze that seems to be never ending.  I think its very possible that the two of them could be aware of the situation.  This gave me the idea that perhaps they are both in this maze for a reason and are diametrically opposed.  This is a point is more speculation and not what Im actually sure of but what if one of them is a prisoner here and the other is the warden?  That was the initial plan at any rate but now that the cycle has been going on for a long time Rikas words seem to imply hundreds of cycles with her  years comment they are both ready for it to end?  It was intended to be an endless hell of tragedy and suffering but there is a way out after all.  Now that Ive typed it perhaps theyre both prisoners but with different objectives.Wild Speculation for Higurashi and Umineko connections I have also begun to think that its very possible that Furude Rika and Frederica Bernkastel are the same person.  I havent read Umineko yet as I wanted to read this first so I know nothing of Fredericas character other than the fact she exists. The only reason I throw this out is because Rika has said a few things that are reminiscent of the poems that preface each chapter.  These poems reminded me greatly of the situation I perceive Rika to be in and seem as though they could have been written by her.  Perhaps Frederica is the Rika that has escaped from the maze.  This is probably way offbase but I thought it would be a fun thought to include as there is probably some connection between them.In the interest of not turning this into another massive post chain Ill carry on at this point.  Im someone who when reading VNsbooks or playing video games inevitably hits a point of no return and I must finish it before anything productive can be done.  Higurashi has more or less reached that point for me now and so my free time is going completely into it.MINAGOROSHI  or s My Guardian Deity Cant Be This Cute!Minagoroshis This chapter began pretty much exactly the way I wanted it to.  I got my confirmation about Rika!  My sense of satisfaction was somewhat short lived though because thinking about the implications of Rikas predicament was quite depressing.  I was very pleased to have it laid nicely out for me and to discover the time loop functioned more or less exactly as I expected.  My above thought about Ooishi possibly being trapped as well must have been a misreading of the narrator on my part of that particular section because there was no indication of that anywhere here.  I suggested the time loop might have been something of a prison and in a sense it is though not in the manner that I meant it.  Its a voluntary cycle that shes running that she can quit anytime but she obviously doesnt want to as it would mean her permanent death. I like Rikas explanation of it being a maze that shes trying to escape from.Minagoroshis Hanyuus presence pretty much instantly explained a number of things I had no explanation for prior to knowing about her including how Rikas maze was possible.  I very much enjoyed the way the first portion of the chapter was handled with the friends all working together to overcome adversity.  It was great to see how Keiichi was able to pick Rika up out of her slump from her  year hell and give her a drive to actually try to take her fate into her own hands instead of being an observer.  Overall I found this arc very enjoyable.Minagoroshis I was surprised as I was getting into the explanation of the real situation in Hinamizawa how many of even my early theories had some merit.  Of course I was completely off the wall in regards to the nature of the curse but Im overall pretty pleased with how I did on my theories with the answers I got at this point.  I had a lot of thoughts that were on track over the course of reading but didnt get taken into the theories I had put together.  If my reading had been more spaced out I might have gotten more things correct with the time to revisit all the thoughts Id had over the course of reading.Minagoroshis I had a feeling there was a degree of truth in Takanos notes that drove Rena into her insanity from Tsumihoroboshi.  They just seemed far too detailed to be only a crackpot story made up for that arc.  Im not particularly pleased with that explanation though to be honest.  Ive been favoring supernatural explanations for events from a very early stage of reading and this arc started with a huge supernatural element in the existence of Hanyuu alone.  But then it decided to dial it back and explain the science of the pathogen when I would have been perfectly happy with a supernatural cause for the curse.  Its not a huge leap from the demon blood explanation which I was perfectly fine with so I cant complain too much as its basically a scientifically explained version of what could have been a supernatural phenomenon.  I wouldve been happier if things had stuck to just one or the other though instead of trying to mix the two.  Even though the groundwork was laid for it I feel like it came a bit too out of left field.continued in next post,visualnovels,d21meog,6,t5_2r5yf

Objectively its only good notable for having several character nuances and development that almost all other VNs avoid but minus points for the somewhat weaker art although it is serviceable but it gets many bonus points for dialogue subtleties of it being OEL compared to most EN translations of other works note this adds an additional specific layer of elitism from JPreaders I suppose.Well my opinion doesnt include any familiarity with what may have happened in the old days prior to the existence of rks where gushing ks posts may or may not have flooded this sub.

7881417,0,t3_4n71eb,Tokyo BabelIve finished both of Raziels endings. I liked her the least during the common route stuff so figured Id get her out of the way first. I suppose its pretty good but I cant help but getting a little caught up in missed potential. Its early but so far it just kind of feels that for every great aspect theres something in a similar area that is holding it back. Visually its stunning which is a word I dont expect to use to describe VNs very often. The art design and execution is excellent in almost every respect. The frequent use of sprite motion and effects is great at keeping me engaged. Theres a ton of CGs. If the Extras screen is to be believed then theres  of them and most Ive seen so far are excellent. However Ive experienced some serious screen tearing issues that didnt seem fixable. The technical hiccups really detract from the otherwise strong visuals. The music is good. Im not a great music critic so I cant say much beyond that. Its got the standard VN BG music fare. The bass line to Castling Man rocks my socks off. The setting is unique and its an interesting take on JudeoChristian mythology. It has a lot of promise and isnt something that is explored very often. The only other recent original narrative I can remember taking a crack at it is Darksiders. The idea of the characters raison dtre lit translation reason to live giving them a metaphysical impact on the world is really cool. However so far it feels like its using the setting to be edgy rather than the narrative actually benefiting from it. It wasnt exactly a shock when the ending has you s fighting an insane version of God. It leans more towards Dantes Inferno the video game than Divina Commedia in that regard.The characters are all likable. I had a feeling that Setsuna the MC and Raziel would be my least favorite of the primary characters and after playing through Raziels routes where it was primarily them I hope that feeling stays true. So far Im just struggling with the lack of true depth to any of the characters. Setsuna and Raziel both felt flat and minor characters are minor characters. Sorami and Lillith seem more interesting so Im looking forward to their routes. Its nice that Setsuna is his own character rather than SelfInsertkun. But its a shame that hes the emotionless and stoic type so there isnt much character there. Dont get me wrong hes fine but the story would work a bit better with a more relatable standard protagonist. Hes also a bit of a gary stu. His raison dtre is literally s overcoming the impossible which kind of removes all tension from you MC fighting.Raziel felt much of the same way. It seemed like much too flat of a character. In fact when you find out that she s caused the whole shitshow of a setting one of the other characters comment on how that cant be the whole story because shes too boring. Ive also never been much of a fan of the airheaded bookwoorm archetype either. It might just be the anime binge Ive gone on recently but I couldnt help but think multiple times that this would have worked better as an anime. Its good because of the visuals and music so having a more tight control on those would be to its benefit. On the flip side I cant really see it working well as a true written novel at all. Which generally is a red flag unless that reason is the narrative elements being dependent on being a VN MuvLuv Little Busters game Spec Ops Bioshock movie play etc. Perhaps Im being a bit too critical because I have enjoyed reading it. If I had to give it a score at the moment itd probably be a  out of  which probably sounds high if you read the wall above because despite the criticism it is a fun read and sometimes you need those. If you enjoy edgy action and can handle some somewhat visceral subject matter then its worth a read. ,visualnovels,d41y0s2,5,t5_2r5yf

7900285,0,t1_d43z8h9,Ill be fair and say youre not wrong but thats not entirely correct either. Its kinda a mix of both the MCs story revolves around him and his somewhat immature perspective but the world he lives in couldnt care less of his naive viewpoints and punches his eyeballs  inches into his brain. IMO the adult theme in MLA is how the world doesnt coddle you and you have to learn to keep up with it or die plus how there are many complex variables out of your control and you act without having knowledge of them only to realize your folly in hindsight. Though adult themes may be vague and debatable by definition though I see your definition id say some of those wont necessarily hinder a VN from having mature themes while having some of those characteristics present it constantly pushes the reader to look from a more mature context as the story progresses and the MC becomes more conscious of the results of his actions and constantly weighs what he has to givegive up in order get the best result not just for himself but for everyone else.,visualnovels,d442e5w,6,t5_2r5yf

8195116,0,t3_4rkggc,Rose Guns DaysLast week was probably my busiest week of the summer so unfortunately I didnt get nearly as much read as Id wanted to.  Instead of finishing First Season as per my plan I only finished the first two chapters so itll be a short one this week.The setting of Rose Guns Days is pretty interesting.  For those who dont know it takes place in post WWII Japan where American and Chinese military groups have settled in and are supplanting Japanese culture with their own.  Japanese citizens unable to speak those respective languages are hard pressed to find work outside of degrading physical labor or joining one of these foreign militaries.  Our protagonist Leo is a repatriated Japanese solidier returning to his homeland to be met with this very different and unwelcoming Japan.  Leo eventually takes a different route and begins working in the seedier realms of society working as a bodyguard for a club of women of the night as the translation group likes to call them.Again Im not too far in yet so Im not going to address the plot past that.  So far the message that Rose Guns Days seems to be trying to convey is that there are good people in all walks of life and someones profession does not say anything about the kind of person they are.  The cast is a fairly likable bunch so far though at the point I am no one has a great deal of depth to their character yet.  I definitely cant leave this week without addressing my concern from last week regarding the combat minigame.  Last week I was pretty skeptical of its inclusion and my concerns about it have been alleviated.  There is a lot of fighting in Rose Guns Days and instead of countless repetitions of the same tired fight scenes weve seen in so many action VNs Rose Guns Days has this nice little minigame for the reader to play to keep things fresh while still showing that all the brawls are happening.  In early chapter  I was already grateful for it and I can say now this week that it was definitely a good design choice.  Its also completely skippable for those who dont wish to take part in it which I think is great.Rose Guns Days has yet to completely draw me in and hook me despite the intriguing premise and likable characters but once the plot picks up a bit more I expect to be moving pretty quickly through it.,visualnovels,d51xwm9,9,t5_2r5yf

But the VN is still a few levels above it. You just dont get all the great character interactions in minigames or the subtle storytelling only possible thanks to the VN medium.

8371029,0,t3_4tah5d,MaybeTechnical question! I am currently trying to switch from ITH to Visual Novel Reader. However I cannot install EDICT. Seems like it is because the file edictu.gz is expected by VNR to have a min size of MB whereas the one where VNR is searching is only MB large. maybe it has been changed? tampering with the source code to remove the size check brings a UTF codec errorSooo Ive been thinking of directly putting the installed files of EDICT in the Cache directory.

Its kind of like a sequel even though it wasnt supposed to be but its pretty much marketed that way as a standalone game that follows the story of the first one.There is some sense in reviewing only Extra  Unlimited as they are being sold separetely at least from the perspective of a game reviewer.There is a chance that ALTERNATIVE the third part will wrap all these things up but thats not the game Im reviewing here.Hes probably well aware that his thoughts might change once he reads Alternative but since it will be sold as its own thing and is a game it makes sense for him to think of that as only a merit of MLA when its really a merit of MuvLuv as a whole.,visualnovels,d67kuv7,2,t5_2r5yf

9104040,0,t3_54ybed,Umineko no Naku Koro ni  hours in and saw the first more shocking discovery first impression    Vacation just started what better time to finally start the highly acclaimed and recommended Umineko series?Bought the Steam version and am using the th Modding patch  Good decision to do that I think. The backgrounds are really gorgeous and switching back and forth between the original characters vs. the ones from this mod Ive go to say that it makes a big difference for me for how the novel feels like. As much as people sometimes claim that graphics are not important at all I feel like the it actually adds a lot here to have this higher quality standard.The patch is working okay so far some minor issues are there and automatic Steam updates definitely are an issue. But nothing unsolvable or thats really bugging me so far. The only thing I am not so sure about is the voice acting  Im still considering to turn those off because the quality and my personal acceptance is kind of differentiating here. Kinzos voice when having his moment is totally overacted Eva is almost a parody of a villain Maria is one of the most annoying performances I have ever heard  at the same time Jessica is supercute Battler very flexible... not sure whether to leave them on or not honestly.    Anyway regarding the novel itself I probably have seen absolutely nothing by now. It really has a very very slow start. Nevertheless the seeds for some very nice drama and mindgame stuff are definitely there and Im curious where it will lead to. Unfortunately Im always totally oblivous of special things so that I dont expect to offer some cool theories here in the following weeks...    Just some initial thoughts although its probably worthless at my current reading pointUminekos Just to get it off my chest Hooooly sh Maria is such an annoying character why was she added? Uuurgh. I know I was probably supposed to feel devastated when Rosa finally beat her up but I couldnt help but cheering especially since everything she said were exactly my thoughts about this character. Not only is this Uu stuff totally annoying text and voicewise but the tantrums she throws sometimes are even worse.  Uminekos That being said I think they did a good job in viewing some character connections as well as shed some light into their motivations. For example Battler and Kyrie were absolutely awesome together. Despite what Battler said about the distance he has to her because of the family situation I felt like they really are soulmates. I really would have liked to see those two work together. Mentioning this I found Kyries theory that Beatrice is actually one of the people instead of an additional person really awesome  although from the screenshots I can be pretty sure she is an additional one. But if I didnt see any pictures beforehand I definitely would have suspected Jessica and Natsuhi now. Both seem to have the motivations to act as Beatrice and in case of Natsuhi I feel like theres even some kind of evidence added. e.g. her constant headaches and the whole waking up from her perspective kinda seems to be an indication for me that she might be more active during night than what the writer wants the readers to believe at that point. Her headache basically coming from leading this doublelife and not sleeping enough. Additionally I was kind of confused why the writing sometimes switched perspectives regarding her perspective from the third to the first person. I cannot really imagine this being a translation issue as she is the only character where this happens sometimes. Still in both cases it leaves the question open how Kinzo was supposed to see her...kinda rules out Jessica but I also wonder if theres any possibility of Natsuhi being Kinzos beloved Beatrice  would need some serious transformation for not making him notice though...Uminekos Anyway having so many people almost immediately killed was definitely a surprise. Was kind of expecting it for Rudolf and Shannon but that many people going? And Kyrie on top of that who basically was set up as some cool person to keep things interesting? Screenshots on VNDB already told me though that this will not mean the end for them would have wondered about that...Im really curious how this novel continues which is a good thing I guess .,visualnovels,d865qzg,8,t5_2r5yf

9747677,0,t1_dae93wo,Well I am still checking in on the thread and replying to questions!  To put it simply there is no time that works for everyone if we aim for the evening in Europe its the middle of the night for us here in Japan and people in the US are likely busy at work or school. If we aim for evening in the US Europe gets shafted as you said. And if push a little later and go for early morning in Europe now the US has gone to sleep.  Combine that with the fact that the US is our biggest market by far and not just in regards to crowdfunding it makes unfortunately logical sense to choose the time frames that we do. The best we can do is things like coming back and answering questions later. As far as the Kickstarter itself goes separating the Early Bird tiers into two waves something like  is something I only just thought of but may be an idea we could explore for potential future campaigns.    As for Kourin no Machi its an entirely separate game and isnt part of this project but if the Kickstarter andor sales of the Sharin localization do exceptionally well and fan demand is high we can certainly explore the idea of localizing that game as well at some point down the road.,visualnovels,daem3if,3,t5_2r5yf
9761334,0,t1_dag9lac,Regrettably I havent finished Ever but as far as the Zero Escape series goes I honestly think  was the weakest of the three. Its by no means badI think its an amazing game and still one of the best VNs ever made easily in my top .I feel like the sequels get judged largely for how they compare to the original with no consideration made for the games as they advance the storyline of the original which is a bit unfair. For example people knock on the sequels for being unable to stand on their own without the reader having knowledge of  but in the same breath theyll knock the sequels for not being enough like . Do you want a standalone game or a sequel? Additionall most people disliked the art direction of Virtues Last Reward and the D anime character design but I think it made the characters a lot more human. Instead of being an observer I felt like a participant.I cant go as deep into detail as Id like because I refuse to spoil this amazing trilogy for anyone but I think the games are as good as each other at the bare minimum with the storytelling getting more dramatic and highstakes as the story continues into Zero Time Dilemma. God I would spend every last cent in my name just to be able to experience these games again for the first time.EDIT Added some more detail because I was getting downvotes for not explaining enough.,visualnovels,dagaw04,3,t5_2r5yf

Japanese has dozens upon dozens of them with different nuances that show how characters present themselves and refer to others but I have yet to see anyone who wants them left untranslated.People seem perfectly content when a girl who refers to herself as boku loses her trademark pronoun yet will argue at length whether she should call the protag lastnamekun or lastname.,visualnovels,dfibgp8,8,t5_2r5yf

11699095,0,t1_dgm3leg,Im honestly confused to this attitude...Do you really believe that unless the all ages and  versions cost exactly the same its not koshercensorship?Because I dont think Jast SP or Mangagamer has ever done that...,visualnovels,dgm409l,8,t5_2r5yf
11787129,0,t3_6862n6,Its time for a story. I ship out to Basic Training on May nd and I was out on a hike with my parents about  weeks ago. Normally I dont talk about VNs to them because its relatively complicated and involves a lot of sad things but because I was leaving soon I just kinda went on and on.  things I specifically said was that I was sad that I couldnt get MuvLuv Alternative to work and that Grisaia no Rakuen the third in the trilogy of my favorite VN series wasnt out and I didnt know when Id be able to play it. Through some stroke of luck I got Muv Luv to work about a week ago. Finished it no less than  minutes before posting this. Was feeling pretty down because now I had nothing to do before leaving and I was gonna be bored as fuck. So I go onto rvisualnovels to look up some discussions about it and I see this post. I jump my ass out of my chair grab my keys and fucking book it to the bank deposit my  I had been saving for a nice dinner before I leave and now as I type this the game is downloading. Now to power through this game in  days.Edit Sadly I dont have enough time to wait for the  version as much as I would like to but Im definitely replaying once it comes out.,visualnovels,dgw3zea,22,t5_2r5yf
11801486,0,t3_673bre,So Im tying to extract edit then repack certain files for Yumina the Ethereal. Crass has been successful in extracting what I need but I cant find any way of repacking. How do I use the Assage part of Crass? I cant see it anywhere.,visualnovels,dgxqmle,1,t5_2r5yf
