1842185,0,t1_ckb439r,I used USPS and I actually had a small box but otherwise Target or dollar stores have small shipping boxes. Dont buy at the post office because the prices are ridiculous! Also if your post office has an APS machine its blue you can use that to weigh the package and then buy postage online since its cheaper that way and the USPS website guides you through all the customs form that need to be filled out for international shipping. Its actually a super easy process and doesnt require any more effort than domestic shipping! ,makeupexchange,ckb6hfh,2,t5_2tijo

The Naked  pallet I sold for only  dollars and most people sell one like that for  same with stila magnificent metals it retails for  dollars I used it only once but sold it for  dollars.

I like a drier formula rather than wet. But then thanks to ipsy I got DS of tarte lash camera lashes amp urban decay perversion mascara amp fell in love with both so I started to branch out.

Is there anything special I need to know. I know Ive read i some of the posts where someone will mention they want something only to be denied either due to not having high enough points ? is this the right word? or because they backed out of a sell earlier from the current seller. Any advice would be appreciated as I have some things that just dont work for me that Id like to get rid of. ,makeupexchange,colfz1m,1,t5_2tijo
