Its possible to have every trophy and no cloak patterns or white cloak if you delete your save. Its possible to get all trophies without maxing the cloak pattern even without deleting your save. Its possible to have maximum patterns with only one trophy Rebirth and thats only because its impossible to play multiple times without earning that trophy.Im a huge fan of the game I can say Ive played hundreds of times with no exaggeration. I know how the cloak patterns work.,JourneyPS3,d8vam23,2,t5_2tun0
