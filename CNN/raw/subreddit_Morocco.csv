However even if that person tried something the worst that could happen to you is most probably people talking behind your back. And since youre open about being an atheist and judging from the opinion you have on your relatives this is probably already happening to you.Quite frankly you dont risk anything.Now about losing your Moroccan citizenship you can enroll in another countrys army you then lose it automatically but you cannot ask to lose it. Then again wanting to lose any nationality isnt very clever in my opinion having the nationality spares you a lot of trouble going in and out of any given country you dont pay some fees you would be paying otherwise and in the eventuality you one day choose to go to that country for an extended period of time it saves you a whole lot of trouble. People over here have been living for  years in Morocco and still dont have the citizenship because the only way to obtain it is to be born from Moroccan parents and they sure wish they had the possibility to obtain it.,Morocco,cybrubn,8,t5_2qpwb

9784039,0,t3_5faq5z,The counter works for single fares or groups traveling as a single fare. You do not have to consent to the driver picking up combined fares along the way but if you do you will simply have to negotiate your fare separately from the others at the rate you believe is fair for you if you had been driving alone. The other fares are a free bonus for the driver. Sometines they might be his family or friends and ride for free with your permission. If you stop a Petit Taxi that already has fares in it you should negotiate your share before getting in. Its a bit complex but boils down to haggling for your price as for anything else.

11428176,0,t3_633a91,Hi all I think the first place is way too crowded we should maybe try on this empty space in the west with already some red on it. Im not sure how many ppl there are in it but at least we wont be making some nice civilized ppl angry Updated script for the new coordinates Link to the new place My apologies to our friends from rtaiwanuDovahkiinM  can you pls update your script thnx for the help!uitsAmeMorio uWinterRise uOppidumNovumite you guys too EDIT I may have rushed this one too the indonesians are building their flag here too. The top left corner which seems to be empty looks to me like some sort of black hole its quickly overriden by black and we could be trolled out of it. I dont have much time now so Im gonna back out a bit and leave someone with more time to contribute and maybe find us a better place. Cheers.,Morocco,dfrde9q,5,t5_2qpwb
