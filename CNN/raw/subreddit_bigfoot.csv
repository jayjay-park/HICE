Ive never seen this piece of evidence before and if you could only cut out all the interpretive overlay it would be so much better.  It actually does appear to be what a bipedal hominid species would look like in that situation.  Its exciting footage no doubt.  Now for my critical interpretationWhoever is analyzing this should get in on the zapruder film.  There is just so much guesswork into their interpretation.  The film is too blobsquatchy to accurately make out any of the points being said.  Every single analysis is akin to confirmation bias and pareidolia.  For example if you showed the clip  where it was stated inline step.  like walking on a tightrope without any text before it you wouldnt immediately come to that conclusion.  IMO this suffers the same fate that the people who work with EVPs fall prey to.

Koonbo sp? Coming on and talking about variation within the species without ANYTHING besides anecdotal evidence and his word.. Bob Garrett and his supposed governmental entrapment apparently due to finding a camp utterly ransacked by sasquatch complete with blood spatters which seems to somehow have been magically disposed of when a crew of PAID by that I mean making dollars from sasquatch individuals wanted to fly in and have an encounter.FOR THEIR SHOW.

It seems the more famous you become as a socalled Bigfoot researcher the more desperate you become to supply or align yourself with defining proof of Sasquatch. Ultimately leading to the Big Hoax.Let the Sasquatch be with you. commented on a video on YouTube.Shared publicly     Nov  The Bigfoot fraud of Todd Standing and Bigfoot North.Dr Meldrum amp Les Stroud Todd Standings three Bigfoot photos are so laughable and clearly a hoax together with his socalled research.

7683777,0,t3_4kkc5c,Thats really interesting stuff. Here is what Cliff Barackman makes of the eyeshine reports Most but not all bigfoot eyeshine is described as red. Human eyes shine in flash photography with a red light because the flash is reflected off of the bloodrich retinas at the back of the eye. Perhaps the sasquatch eye is so efficient at gathering the available ambient light even in very lowlight conditions that it can focus what little light there is on the retina and have some reflect back at the witness. In dark conditions it wouldnt take much reflected light to stand out against the black background and would indeed appear to glow. The reports of other eyeshine colors in sasquatches suggests the presence the reflective layer behind the retina called the tapetum lucidum which is commonly found in nocturnal animals. However the inconsistency of reports leaves this presence far from certain.Copied from It sounds more viable than an Ape have a tepetum licidum from what you have told us,bigfoot,d3fljpc,9,t5_2re9c

7734609,0,t1_d3l5ymp,But without establishing the larger thing  Sasquatch in this case  its not even a shred. At CERN for example they picked up a tiny hint of a possible new particle last year. But the pvalues were too low to determine if the signals were random noise or evidence of the new particle.If in the current ATLAS run CERN determines there is a sigma determination that a new particle exists then the signals from  will be classified as the first shreds of evidence or something pointing to the greater whole. If not they will be classified as noise. But nobody at CERN is currently making the category error of calling the  signals evidence of a new particle.In the upside down world of Sasquatch science people think otherwise. They sort of assume the existence of Sasquatch and then classify things like footprints howls dermal ridges and wood knocks as evidence. That is simply unacceptable to me from a scientific standpoint. It is backwards it makes no sense at all.I think we need a Sasquatch in hand to properly classify things like footprints blobsquatches etc. as evidence. At this point it could equally be noise and not part of anything larger. This is why I object to calling anything thus far as evidence  it simply isnt yet. It is a signal of interest but we have no way of differentiating hoax from real we dont know what real is. What I do know is that lots of people want sasquatch to be real including myself which makes it even more necessary to set the bar high.To wit there is an entire TV entertainment genre based on incorrect thinking about Sasquatch. Hell  of Americans believe in Sasquatch which is as terrifying as it is staggering. Then again  of Americans believe in Creationism so I give up at the population level!I look at it this way We only need a single good chunk of DNA a skeleton or body and I would even accept a  kickass HD video to prove sasquatch exists. This is not a crazydifficult bar to get over it seriously is not. On the other hand we can pile all the crappy shreds of evidence collected over the last  years of sasquatchery into an enormous pile of supposed evidence and it doesnt for make a better argument. Its still the same inconclusive trash we started with and were no closer to sasquatch being real. GAH!That is my position and it is the one mainstream science takes.I personally like the way the NAWAC guys have organized their research but after viewing the power point presentations and listening to the recordings and pondering the evidence collected  its still the same old crap. And that is more than a little disappointing...I hope they bring a type specimen in I really do. Cause thats what it will take harsh as that is to imagine.

7762705,0,t1_d3odctk,Thanks for the civil response I much prefer discussion over mockery. I know the guys commented about walking down the log but I dont think they ever actually showed it. Also as Im sure you know its really difficult to identify tracks when the snow is deep because theres no detail. Because the snow falls into the footprints as soon as the animal takes a step it loses all detail and just looks like a hole in the snow especially if it snows again after the track is made as  happened in the video. I disagree with the comment about how much moose move in the winter. In my experience moose move significant distances in the winter and because of their height and high stepping walk in snow  inches is no big deal for an adult moose. And I might be wrong but I think they said they on the video they only tracked it for  miles  in one direction and  in the other direction. I will admit a couple of the tracks they showed do look humanish but tracks in the snow often distort depending on how the snow settles in them and especially over a period time. As I said before Im not definitively saying its not a Sasquatch but even with what the guys in the video chose to show Im still not convinced its not a moose track. ,bigfoot,d3ok4rp,1,t5_2re9c

Therefore I would be inclined to believe that the sketch is more accurate than not.Thank you for your thoughts on the matter.

9501347,0,t3_5awv6x,This whole thing feels kind of weird. You have academics saying without question that Bigfoot doesnt exist so why bother researching it? That just seems counterintuitive and foolhardy.That said if Dyer wants to use public funds for such research he should do it in a strictly academic and scientific manner with necessary approvals protocols and trained scientists.Finally this is . Big fucking deal for a huge state university. Where Im from New Jersey reporters investigate public university spending to the tune of  million or more. This is a very small story and the news organization is basically implying that theres no need to explore the possibility that Bigfoot is out there.Im not biased one way or another. Im interested in the lore and the possibility of Bigfoot. I have no idea if it exists. But Id rather have actual scientists researching this. Also if this is a violation of the public trust whats next? Are we going to cut university money that goes toward folklorists and their conferences?,bigfoot,d9k8s5v,3,t5_2re9c

It could be that some people see something they dont understand  for example a fleeting glimpse  and fill in the reference they have on file so to speak.The other possibility is of course that the film is of a genuine Sasquatch and that witnessses are accurate in their description.

Thats where my friend is from just to the left of Wakefield is Ashland Wisconsin where I traveled many times for hockey. Theres so many small towns in this area bigfoot probably would have been proven already. And Ottawa National Forest is nothing like Superior National Forest where you wont see civilization for over  miles a time that also extends into Canada. But to get to the Wakefield area it had to have been travelling from the North but to do that it had to bypass Duluth and I the busiest freeway in the state or swim across Lake Superior which no animal can do. And most believable stories bigfoot does not have black fur.  But say it were bigfoot why would he travel there? Because he absolutely cannot live there or he would be found. These are just my theories.gtAnd this is a man that used to bait bear with only a  inch knife!!!!Just No. He either tells his girlfriend tall tales of himself or he likes to torture animals.Sadly BFRO always has more details on the investigator than the people who saw it.
