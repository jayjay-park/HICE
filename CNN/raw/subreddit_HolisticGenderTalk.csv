7424515,0,t1_d2lyou4,gt A lot of Gender critical feminists dont take issue with people transitioning their sexThats not what they said when asked Im afraid.  Example example example example example example  As much as GCers are consistent about anything being a diverse group of people like any other group the general consensus seems to be that were cis people who just dont know it yet and once we have conversion therapy to come to terms with this well no longer want to change sex solving the problem.  This exactly mirrors the stance of homophobes who think that gay people are really straight and dont know it yet and once we have that conversion therapy well no longer want to date people of the same sex solving the problem of us existing.This again also reinforces the narrative that everyones born cis and some people suffer a trauma to turn them trans and if only they can get over that trauma with therapy theyll become cis again.  This is exactly the same as the narrative that everyones born straight some people become gay due to a traumatic experience and therapy will make them straight again.  This narrative is not correct.gt trans people may be killed for being transThey are shockingly frequently.  Especially trans women of colour.  Especially black trans women.gt but biologically female people are killed for being female biologically female people are trafficked for being female biologically female people are raped for being female biologically female people have their rights eroded for being female capacity to decide what to do with their bodies in terms of abortion etcSome of these are issues that only affect female bodied people including trans men and some of these are issues that affect only women including trans women and some of these are issues that affect everyone.  All need to be fixed.  All these things are horrible and must be stopped.  And if youre trans you get these issues on top of people killing or raping you for being trans.  And if youre a person of colour you get all that on top of police giving you six warning shots in your back for being a child playing with a toy gun.  We need to fix all of these things.gt The social stratificiation woman is bad for females. This doesnt mean that I think females are bad and it doesnt mean that I think masculinity is what everyone should then be.gt but man and women are harmful constructs.Im glad we can agree that femalebodied people arent bad and that masculinity isnt preferred by everyone.Could you elaborate on how you think man and woman are harmful constructs?  Id like to abolish gender roles as much as anyone.  I think if someone wants to do something neither their sex nor their gender should be something others use as an excuse to tell them they cant.In terms of the words existing theyre just words.  Having a word to describe happilymostlyfemalebodied people and happilymostlymalebodied people is useful although limiting and to be taken with a pinch of salt.  The problems creep in when people say women cant do this and men cant do that.gt gender is a function of ensuring people arent treated equallyI believe youre talking about gender roles here?  Gender orientation some people being happier in a mostlyfemale body some happier in a mostlymale body etc usually matching the one they were born with as it was outofthebox surely isnt a problem just as sexual orientation some people being happier dating mostly women some happier dating mostly men etc isnt a problem.  Gay and straight people existing isnt inherently going to cause people to be treated badly.  Homophobia is.  Women and men existing isnt going to inherently cause people to be treated badly.  Sexism is.gt Gender identity theorypolitics has already been coopted to work within patriarchial ideals. Its not leaving patriarchy behind its working well within the parameters to keep the system going.I still have no idea what GCers mean by trans theory besides how trans people mostly subscribe to the theory that we should be allowed to exist.  In terms of keeping the patriarchy going we could always discuss how GCers tend to be anti trans people and mostly anti trans women more than theyre pro women or pro gay to the point where radicalcrayon thankfully downvoted at least even there is apparently going to vote for Trump or Cruz in much the same way Sheila Jeffreys famously said she agreed mostly with noted homophobe Norman Tebbitt and GCers have pretty consistently sided with antiwomen antigay antitrans hate groups in order to harass trans women and girls.  Just look at how often the GC subreddits link to Daily Mail right wing articles agreeing with them and talk about how The Guardian consists of liberal censors  Theyve even started complaining about SJWs lately a phrase Ive literally only seen used seriously by GCers and GGers a hate mob of mostly video game fanatics that attacks feminists pointing out problems in the industry along with women and people in minority groups who are working in the industry or speaking out about these things.  Over video games.To simplify matters if youre pro women pro people of colour pro gay people but anti trans people then youre left wing with three groups of people and right wing with another.  If that last one is more important to you than the others then you end up reading right wing newspapers and voting for right wing politicians and teaming up with right wing hate groups which makes you indistinguishable from any other right wingers.  I dont think you personally do any of this just to be clear but it definitely appears to be a trend amongst GCers generally especially on the subreddits where the moderates tend to be banned or at least heavily downvoted for claiming the extremists are going too far.  This is not healthy.gt I can envision where being a female isnt such a bad thing  but not the social construct of women woman has been designed as less. So my goal is gender abolishment.This might be a semantic issue again Im not sure.  Id like to live in the world where neither of us get any flak for who we are for simply being ourselves.  Id also like to live in a world where doing something isnt considered a feminine or masculine act.  If thats what youre striving for then great so am I.  I dont want either of us to be designated as less than anyone else especially for how we were born.  None of that has anything to do with whether I had to change sex in order to be comfortable in my own body though.I mean itd be nice to live in a world where men dont hassle women for being women just as itd be nice to live in a world where straight people dont hassle gay people for being gay.  But teaming up with homophobic men wont get you there.,HolisticGenderTalk,d2m4ahd,5,t5_3devl
