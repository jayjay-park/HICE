1866289,0,t3_2fywd7,The horses that knights rode into battle were called chargers.  The true origin of the name seems to be up for debate but the horse featured in the logo does appear to be wearing armor.KAW!!!!!,ungulateteams,cke2ysx,14,t5_2vnx5

10263083,0,t3_5mwe4w,Very good list of starters for sure. Awesome job uBubonicNarwhalAlthough as a Broncos fan I would certainly replace Demaryius Thomas with Emanuel Sanders. He drops way less balls but other than that this is a damn solid list.,ungulateteams,dc7dk2n,5,t5_2vnx5
10362876,0,t1_dchwhan,The Broncos will not sign Romo. Injury prone and expensive and we need to spend the money on an O line. Siemian is an excellent quarterback who needs more protection than he got this year and more practice with gametime decision making. ,ungulateteams,dcioz0m,6,t5_2vnx5

11359599,0,t1_dfjkaqy,So we should be the ungulates teams bitch instead?The difference between ELOE turning on us and the ungulates clopping about with their Friendship is Magic bullshit is at least theyre up front with their intentions where you try to hide it with greater good talk.We chose the side that benefits us  the Colts are gone anything extra is just a bonus. Ungulates cant even organize enough to vote Texans out of this sub  theres absolutely no benefit in choosing TeamClipClopFlipFlop over ELOE you dont even have power in your own sub.,ungulateteams,dfjl8o6,24,t5_2vnx5

11385630,0,t1_dfmcdg9,I cant argue with this level of stupidity. Without us the Patriots would have been voted out yes. But without the Patriots we would have been voted out too. It goes both ways. We are equally beneficial to eachother. If you cant see this I honestly dont see how I can even continue a conversation with you.,ungulateteams,dfmjils,4,t5_2vnx5
