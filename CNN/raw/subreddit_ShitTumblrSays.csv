I still dont know too much about it but theres a lot of reasons people ID as otherkin and they all should be respected and treated fairly because it literally doesnt harm anyone. From what I do know is that a lot of them are doing it as a religiousspiritual thing many of them are neurodivergent and use it as a coping mechanism some of them identify with the animal not as the animal and then theres the people who ID as toiletpaper or backpacks which are obvious trolls. Im sure theres still a lot more to it but my knowledge about it is just slightly more than the average person,ShitTumblrSays,csj599z,8,t5_2vhbl
