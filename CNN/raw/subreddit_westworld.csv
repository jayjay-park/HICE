The inside tattoo on the scalp the MIB took looks just like a classical depection of the Labrynth found on ancient coins. Everyone talks in a way that seems to indicate hes a relic. Perhaps the company needs Ford because he is the only one who knows every single secret ones that are important to keeping the Hosts in the park.

So the maze metaphorically speaking is to keep MIB from discovering something.Personally I think Ford wants to create not just a sentient being but to create a copy of himself after all who else could the young boy have been whos father was much like Fords and the father was missing...

9221959,0,t1_d8k4u13,I rewatched the episodes and I think this theory is still plausible. They only make reference to Dolores being the oldest host in the park and not any specifics about how old she is. They also make many references to how most of the models have been repurposed at one time or another. In particular Dolores father had been Mr. Abernathy for at least the  years that Bernard has been there he was the sherif before that and the professor before that. If he is in any way indicative of the rest of the host then I could see some faces overlapping between present day and  years prior.ampnbspWhat also struck me was that when Maeve was taken out of rotation for repairs they made Clementine the new madam and remarked about how shes done it before. In the scenes with William there is no Maeve to be seen even though she hadnt been taken out of commission by that point in the episode. Moreover Clementine is the one that courts William both on the street and in his room later at night. She even says if Im not your type then we can find someone who is. This sounds like something the head of the brothel would say and not just any random prostitute. I am willing to bet that Williams scenes are still in the past and at this time Clementine was the acting madam with Maeve perhaps fulfilling some other completely unrelated role.ampnbspThe other thing that struck me as odd was that there was some sort of Union solders brigade interacting with the newcomers as William first got into town. This is in contrast to the sherifs storyline wed seen in episode  where he was trying to gather a party to hunt down the fugitive in the mountains. I think the sherifs prior malfunctioning was to throw us off and have us assume that theyd replaced his story with the Union army one. However before episode  is finished they show the sherif successfully repaired and back to normal. With the big stink that Sizemore throws every time someone tries to change up the storylines Id be surprised if they scrapped the sherifs plot altogether now that hed been fixed. I suspect that the Union plot was an older story that had been replaced in later years. There are also a number of promo shots showing some of our characters dressed in the Union garb Teddy in particular. It could be that this storyline had something to do with the incident theyve alluded to.,westworld,d8ky921,9,t5_2xhxq

9234451,0,t1_d8mfdrn,fun point We notice the cold storage they put Abernathy in was sub basement B. Westworld the original hehe episode  title was set in the year . I think the cold storage area will flood and only a select few hosts will be saved either by Dolores and company or rescuing themselves. I think the flooding will be caused on purpose to save the upper levels from something like youre describing from surfacing.  There are several reasons I think this and I wont go into them all but let me point out a couple? The ARG emails point to leaking pipes from the pool resulting in water in these lower levels. In episode  we see a wave of water rush out when they bay doors open Stubbs explains the ACs been out for weeks. These are very subtle but suggestive happenings in there for a reason. Now this next one is a little more out there but go with me. Dolores is the oldest host in the park. We know this. Dolores was built and rebuilt and rebuilt again in the likeness of man. There is a bit of role reversal here for the story of Adam and Eve. In Genesis God gave his favorite creation Adam a gift so that he would not be alone. This is Teddy. Theodore comes from the greek Theodorus Gods gift. Teddy was created for and bound to Dolores. Bernard is the serpent. He is AI himself and hes helped the advancement of Fords AI. He can learn. At what point does artifical intelligence stop being artificial? The serpent was the most crafty of all the animals. Its said at one time Satan was a highly revered angel.  He leads Dolores to the tree of knowledge and self awareness. Dolores is sharing this rebellion against God with key phrases maybe shared with her thru various avenues by Bernard again a creation of God himself  who loves the rebellion. As Ford inches closer with giving his creations free will via things like reveries and access to memories the serpent sees a way to manipulate it. Continuing with the theme of Genesis Teddys last name is Flood. I think he may also play the role of Noah down the road. Speaking of Genesis one other thing I thought was interesting the young boy Ford meets in the desert presumably him as a child tells a story of wanting to go to the top of the mountain but his father said no. Ford remarks yet here we are. This makes me think of the tower of Babel and how God prevented humans from building to the heavens by confusing their tongues languages so they could not understand each other. Fords comment reinforces were near the end of human evolution  we built the tower to heaven we climbed the mountain  weve  nearly enabled God mode  and theres only one thing left to do. Raise the dead.,westworld,d8mj8u0,45,t5_2xhxq

In real life you typically take a subsample of the real thing and test your code there but this is a human and massive worldlike experience so it may not be possible to duplicate the entire world and so some tests are done live. I think the cost of having him roam around wreaking havoc and repairing it is offset by the quality of the NPCs.  I think hes also taken offline from time to time hence him discussing his return. I also think that Ford is reintroducing him to set judgment on both humans and hosts alike. Some hosts might deserve to live and some guests like the lawful good new character in episode  or dolores.  Im not sure Im speculating but I feel that my theory holds up to some degree especially the MIBs desire to dig deeper and find the end of the maze aka solve the game before the guests for testing.,westworld,d8pusrb,2,t5_2xhxq

MiB knows this but if repeated enough time she may remember and can shoot him. This starting her on the path to selfawareness.MIB is gaming the game. He learnt the park inside out and is gaming it so he can help Dolores breakout of her repetitive life half the time being raped by other guests and hosts. He is hoping to create the right criterias for this to happen.Gives legs to the theory that MIB is helping not hurting Dolores and he is in fact William who has lost a transorming selfaware Dolores once in the past that is  years ago.,westworld,d8zeos0,1,t5_2xhxq

9344726,0,t3_58hm1q,I think his new narrative where he sends Teddy after Wyatt a man who got away for a while came back with strange ideas and claimed he can hear a voice of God is definitely connected to Arnold. After seeing rd episode it seems that Ford really only sees hosts as objects and doesnt want them to evolve. Arnold wanted them to develop consciousness. I think Arnold found a way to put a code in the hosts programming that activates itself when the host is close to evolving  Dolores heard the voice telling her to kill another host but that was after the reveries update and violent delights command she heard. I think Ford isnt as clever as Arnold. His only way to prevent hosts from following the voice is to demonize it  so he introducing a narrative where a man who listens to the voices is a villain. As for reveries update Im starting to think Ford didnt do that. Its Arnold code coming up and making hosts remember little things. Ford panicked and said it was his update. Also someone pointed out how similar Sizemores idea from last episode was to Maeves flashback  maybe thats why Ford said no. Because he feared if the hosts experience something so similar again they will start remembering more and more,westworld,d90iekb,145,t5_2xhxq

A  year park veteran might fix a really cool ride like the Matterhorn but have zero interest in riding it because they have seen it all and are burnt out. But a newer employee who still is charmed by the little things would happily be the first one riding the ride once its repaired.

Ill discuss religion with my close friends but anyone else probably isnt getting indepth discussion.  Im sure tons of people in casual conversation would assume other people are stupid simply because they didnt engage in the deep conversation the first group was expecting.  Dont judge people from simple conversations sounds like youve got a superiority complex.  Thats what really separates the Hosts and us we can hide ourselves and arent programmed to respond to everyone in the same way.  We arent hosts were not obligated to indulge you.

9381622,0,t1_d9564x9,I feel like the answer to this question will help clear up some of the timeline issues.  If people can come into the park on any day for their stay than its likely that a host is killed cleaned up and thrown back in with some attempt to keep them from running into guests that they have already seen.  If the park operates on scheduled blocks to maintain coherent narratives I remember something about one of the narrative people saying they managed to get one character to come in to town two days early then its likely once a host is killed they are removed until the next cycle.  If thats the case then we are seeing way more than two timelines. ,westworld,d956r0k,2,t5_2xhxq

9385671,0,t1_d95gdu2,Im thinking either this or that Ford killed Arnold and turned him into a disembodied AI that is spread out through the whole park.

9400017,0,t1_d97hht7,The guns are real. They shoot bullets but those bullets affect hosts and guests differently. This means either the guns or bullets are smart in some way. In the original movie the guns had heat sensors and didnt shoot real bullets when pointed at a warm target that might be human. Its possible the TV show guns work a similar way and in this episode we also saw that the guns can be disabled remotely. Possibly they can also control the types of rounds or speed of the rounds they shoot when pointed at a human target. Or the bullets are smart. Since hosts and humans have different biologies the bullets may be constructed in a way that they dont harm human tissue on impact but can still pierce the hosts fake skin. We havent been shown exactly how the guns work to not harm people but they definitely shoot bullets. ,westworld,d97inre,4,t5_2xhxq

That would make the show take place about  years after  no?  years does seem like a bit much but Ford is pretty old and it is the futureLets say the flashbacks took place in .  is just . so not too far away from  but still kinda far.

It is entirely possible that there was no actual story connecting the park storylines to the maze before the new Wyatt narrative or there was a narrative in the past connecting the maze to the park storylines and Arnold himself filled that role back then. I get the impression from Fords comments that he eventually spent a LOT of time in the park...maybe he played a role. Ford building a new narrative to replace the old abandoned one is the fiction which like all great stories is rooted in truthEDITgtYeah of course I remember Wyatt. You look upon the face of true evil you aint liable to forget. He claimed he could hear the voice of God. It started down near Escalante. Army was sent to put down the natives. Bad business. Wyatt was a sergeant went missing while out on some maneuvers and came back a few weeks later with some pretty strange ideas.If Army was Delos natives were hosts and Wyatt was Arnold you can see how it lines up with Ford saying that Arnold eventually preferred to talk to the hosts.,westworld,d98rr6e,10,t5_2xhxq

9449945,0,t1_d9dspxo,gt Bernard in HQ interacts with Theresa Stubbs Elsie sizemore listens to his pitch in the present. bernard in the room is from circa  years ago. In another post you put Stubbs either in the present and in the past at an undetermined point in time. Why should it be like that? Stubbs is a human in the present. Stubss in the present sent for a Dolores pickup. In Williams time someone doing Stubbs job in control room sent for that pickup.     In my chronology Bernard Sizemore Theresa and Elsie are ALL in the past.  These characters are no longer at Delos by the time of MiBs latest visit.  Alternatively some are still at Delos but have not been in these scenes to hide the fact that they have aged which would give away a key secret.  Most of the scenes involving Elsie and Sizemore take place over an undetermined duration between  and ish years prior to CurrentMiB.  Some of these scenes the ones related to William are as early as  years prior to CurrentMiBandMaeveBulletWound.  Theresa Sizemore and Elsie might not be around yet at this point.  Stubbs seems to be the only one in all three of these timelines and I think that is a deliberate attempt to misdirect viewers regarding the chronology.  In this scenario I propose that Stubbs is a host.  They already dropped some clues.  Alternatively the StubbsSendsAHandlerAfterDolores scene may relate to DoloresRidesFromRanch as you suggest rather than DoloresIsInLasMudas.  If this is the case then the span of Stubbs events is not so wide and he is not necessarily a host.    gt  Not Maeves present day events the st and nd heist which both Sizemore and Stubbs deal with.     Stubbs is notably the only familiar staff member to deal with the nd Saloon Heist.  In reality its probably  the th saloon heist but its the nd one weve seen.  This including MaeveandHectorDigOutBullet are definitively linked to the MiBs Pyrotechnic hector jailbreak due to the pair of MiBFoundationGrateful guests who link these scenes.  I propose that EpSaloon Heist occurs at least several years after Ep Saloon Heist.  Sizemore is long gone by this point.  In Ep Saloon Heist Maeve was purely scripted.  In Ep Saloon Heist Maeve was partially awakened and had been drawing and forgetting hazmatcrew pictures for quite some time.    gt As a side note there is a weird scene in Fs office. When he talks about A there is a camera shot with the piano player out of focus in the foreground. F and B in the background and as he talks about A he turns his head and looks at the piano player while talking. Weird.    Interesting Ill have to watch for that.

9458327,0,t1_d9evsea,In Williams plot line from what we have seen the hosts are flesh and blood and have well programmed personalities they arent rigid moving and obviously nonhuman robots.  years previous to the current timeline youd see more hosts like the one in the cold storage unit that Ford talks to not boarderline sentient AI like Dolores.This is the first year that William has been to the park. The MiB says hes been going for thirty years. So if the time skip theory is right the Will timeline is  years pervious to the MiB timeline. If thats the case why do the hosts act the same in both story lines? Remember the MiB was talking at Teddy telling him that the hosts were better when they were mechanical contraptions and not fleshblood replicas of people. Is William dealing with mechanical contraptions? Are the hosts around him moving in a stunted manner? Do they answer a long emotional story with hell of a story wanna drink to the lady with the white shoes?.Then we have Wills friend talking about the buyout. Meanwhile behind the scenes there are talks of the park changing hands and a sub plot of a power struggle. Definately not a coincidence.PSThe time skip theory would be dishonest hokey cheesy terrible writing. Its the kind of got ya plot twist that CSI is built on. This is a very well written show and it would dissapoint me greatly if they go with the lame poorly alluded to  cent plot twist to trick viewers.

It is giving Dolores the opportunity to explore as they dont have the available resources to deal with all these new arising problems at once.

When I was a boy my brother and I wanted a dog so our father took in an old greyhound. Youve never seen a greyhound have you Bill? ...A greyhound is a racing dog. Spends its life running in circles chasing a bit of felt made up like a rabbit. One day we took it to the park. Our dad had warned us how fast that dog was but... we couldnt resist. So my brother took off the leash and in that instant the dog spotted a cat. I imagine it must have looked just like that piece of felt. He ran. Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog... running. Until at last he finally caught it. And to the horror of everyone he killed that little cat. Tore it to pieces. Then he just sat there confused. That dog had spent its whole life trying to catch that... thing. Now it had no idea what to do.,westworld,d9h9qvo,3,t5_2xhxq

The hosts passed the Turing test in year one about  years before Williams scenes if they are  years in the past which is being convincingly human via pure conversation text etc. If they were able to do that in one year it is easy to assume they were able to get them pretty convincing in seven. Since then there have likely only been minor tweaks and storyline changes. I dont see the issue or evidence that it is untrue other than just you dont buy it.. This one is pretty easy. Just because something is metal doesnt mean it is bulletproof just try shooting a car door.. Your perspective is skewed. Past Dolores isnt flashing forward present Dolores is flashing backward. She has had that same experience hundreds of times....its not inconceivable that several are mixing together. Again your proof is just that you dont like it and dont want it to be the case.. Another easy one. Nolan has stated that he wants as much of the show to be viewed through the hosts perspectives as possible. Dolores and the other hosts have not been programmed with a stream of consciousness and so they have no ability to organize all of these memories that they are being flooded with. Dolores is losing track of what is present and what is past they are like scattered cards on a table. The idea is that when SHE starts to make sense of the sequence of events we the viewers will be able to make sense of them. Again your evidence is that you dont like it.,westworld,d9iaabs,4,t5_2xhxq

Maybe some folks are having a tough time following all of the stories going on concurrently as the show jumps from scene to scene sporadically but If I watched this show without reading this sub I doubt I would even speculate if were dealing with multiple timelines.  Theres just been nothing solid at all thats indicated it.  Just fuzzy interpretations of what MIGHT be going on behind the sceneswhich is fine I guess but its silly to hang your hat on the theory IMO.    The fact that we dont see any evidence either way in terms of a timeline indicates to me that we shouldnt be fretting over it at this point.

Thats literally a selfdefeating purpose and not giving Ford any credit. They update Dolores so often that shes practically brand new. If Dolores has a rocky past attempting to hurt the park why not just keep her in some interview room if its some technical issue? Injecting her back into the park as a known risk doesnt make Ford some unstable genius it makes him a quack idiot.gt The mystery of Why Keep Dolores is a mysteryMy theory actually disagrees with this as theres no mystery because theres no major issues with her since after she presumably killed Arnold. After that happened they did the initial and only total wipe where just the voice commands of the bicameral mind remain. Ford explains this to Bernard but does not once mention that Dolores seems to be the only one that was unaffected due to the constant maze attempts or park incidents.It honestly just doesnt make sense for Ford to keep Dolores around if shes done anything to negatively impact that park excluding the original critical failure. Critical failure happens gt Dolores amp all hosts are wiped gt  years go by without incident as was explained in the show both at the critical failure level and with Dolores gt MiB arrives then William arrives and then Ford initiates the Wyatt story.If youre going to interject unknown events that the show refuses to reference and change the character of Ford almost entirely as well as construct new rules about their technology you have to admit that the alternative theory is far simpler and more likely without making the claim the writers are intentionally misleading us.,westworld,d9j1ugl,1,t5_2xhxq

As for dual time period I think the OP used a better term of nonlinear timeline which could be different.  In the show Lost there was a while when we were actually shown  completely independent timelines like an alternate universe but more often then not we were shown flashbacks and flashforwards from the same single timeline just in a nonlinear presentation.  Eventually there will be a scene which confirms one way or another which timeline was right and then no matter what there will be some who are disappointed but that hasnt happened yet so in the meantime I enjoy the speculation from different angles.

At any rate any humanguest relationships are always going to be squicky to me because itll never be equal not when the host isnt fully selfaware of what kind of programming shes been subjected to and is still under the impression on some level that her world is real and that shes a human too. TeddyDolores is the more sympathetic relationship at least to me because I think their chemistry is more obvious and you get the impression genuine feelings evolved over so many years of being linked in each others loops. And awakened Dolores wants to free Teddy to be awakened like she is.

9505271,0,t1_d9kkg5m,Perfect sense and I  agree and thank you for not making me feel totally off the wall conspirator. The really tin foil is that what were calling it? side to me feels we will find out Maeve was a guest in the park  years ago and when the critical failure occurs shes killed by the hosts who went mad and her consciousness was downloaded with her memories of her human life and she was turned into a host. Therefore when Dolores sorry for the misspelling previously gives her the TVDHVE command she begins to access her true consciousness that being the reason why she seems to be awaking awakening? Grammar... quickly. I know she sees tMiB in her nightmareflashback of being killed but that could be because he is the reason his technologycompany is the reason shes stuck in this worldhost position. My theory of consciousness transfer comes from the puzzling last question on discover westworld when booking your trip last question refers to if you died in an accident and your memories and consciousness were downloaded into a bot would it still be you thereby making consciousness transfer a part of this puzzle and we need someone besides the Arnold theory to actually have gone through this process....maybe?

9542978,0,t3_5bjvml,Well Im about ready to get off this ride. I dont think Im the demographic for this show. I guess Im not intelligent enough. I honestly feel like this is just a circle jerk for intelligent people. Look how smart we are we watch Westworld. Were associated with the likes of J.J. Abraham and the Nolans. This ups our social status. Lets come up with multiple plot theories on our own for our questions since we only get tiny morsels or no answers at all from the show itself  episodes in. This only betters us. Were using our noodles for critical thinking.I started feeling this way since episode . I came back for episode  because Evan Rachel Wood hyped the fuck out of it. Which it didnt live up to. I guess she was just really happy that her character got to actually do something when she shot the gun. I came back for episode  because the preview they released looked like shit was about to go down. But they didnt even have one of the scenes in the episode. In fact they used the scene for the preview for next episode. If the show was that good they wouldnt have to bait in the marketing like that. At the end of the day I dont want to be mean about it. Its a well made fucking show from an acting and production stand point. Im just not into the Lost style painstakingly slow reveal. Fool me once on that notion. In my opinion the longer the wait for answers the more anti climatic it becomes. Its never going to live up to peoples imaginations. I really wanted to like this show.

Instead he just increased her intelligence like it was nothing big and like some kind of fun experiment. Like ehh why not it could be worse at least i might keep my job.. No. No. No waaay!I really hope theres a good explanation for this whole mess like it was intended and someone was working behind the curtains to make things went exactly like that.edit forgot to mention the grand awesomeness of this show that is Ramin Djawadi.

9548267,0,t1_d9q002v,All those scenes where he wears a leather jacket is really Arnold. Ford describes to Bernard that Arnold was obsessed with making them conscious. This implies he was involved with their coding to some extent. It doesnt mean he was... Regardless he Arnold even says he didnt expect her to become sentient and that he was just curious. I dont have the quotes but its clear it was a mild curiosity that grew into her becoming conscious and him not knowing what to do with her but to create a game maze to help her become free. And you know its not Bernard because he doesntcant remote into her. Which if you were doing a secret book reading club you might be inclined to do. now get back to the others before they notice your gone. Just watch episode two and three knowing that Those Bernard Dolores scenes are actually Arnold Dolores scenes from the beginnings of the park. All the pieces fall right into place. edit I just realized your confusion. I am talking about Bernard being a host of Arnold and not MiB being a coder. ,westworld,d9q0riy,3,t5_2xhxq

You need to communicate the theme of the new setting visually and often times  barring a fullblown worldbuilding experience the only language we can use is the imagery. Things people associate with the future not necessarily something futuristic in itself.Westworld is an awesome example of this  and think about it. Why the fuck is it set in the West? Its set there because everyone is literate in that language. We know what an indian is who the sheriff is  we get that. Were literate. You can instantly tell each of what each of these places are...Think about the swinging doors of a saloon. You recall an entire building there dont you?Im not arguing.

So does that mean that Sylvester is pimping out the dead host women so that the other butchers can have sex with them?

9584412,0,t1_d9tlbsp,Beats me I have no idea what voices people hear. I just meant that the bicameral mind theory was based on events around the Mediterranean around  BC and if it actually did have something to do with the awakening of the human mind it would present a different path of consciousness that what happened in the East. Its possible that Asian civilisation developed subjective consciousness earlier or possibly didnt lose it for as long.An essay I found mentions thisgtAccording to Jaynes people with bicameral minds followed auditory hallucination the divine voice in response to an enlarged community from  to  BC and subjective consciousness appeared around  BC. Unlike the Mediterranean civilizations on which Jaynes theory is based Chinese civilization started with genetically coded primary society and therefore went through a different pathway in the evolution of human minds to subjective consciousness.Its super fascinating to me and really fun to imagine in terms of this show which is clearly about subjective consciousness and the awakening of the mind.,westworld,d9uh331,1,t5_2xhxq

And still Ive had to answer questions like how the heck can you make  anagrams out of my name like that? many times  on the internet. On a site which is very much about links and in a sub where anagrams are a part of the fun I thought that a simple link from a person who works a lot with words could be useful for those who are not as familiar with anagram generators.Why? Because even after  years online I find a lot of interesting stuff through links like this. Sure I could google random topics and find good links myself but I love getting a good direct link from a person who know a lot about the concept of the bicameral mind or from someone who knows which of the thousands of search results that take me to a good indepth description of how the word apperception is used in psychology and philosophy respectively.Google is great but it still doesnt beat direct recommendations from a true topic nerd. Atleast not for those of us who still believe in the value of the human touch.

Once you know the twists in Fight Club and Sixth Sense you go back and watch with a new perspective and love it. Here if its revealed that Dolores has really been on two timelines Im not going to go back and watch the MiB flashback scene with new eyes and be like man this is sooo cool. Im going to go back watch it and think man I liked this better when it seemed like it was about Dolores gaining consciousness remembering her loop and finally breaking out of it.Because thats how I interpreted it the first time and it was great. I dont see how adding a Gotcha! This was actually happening twice on two different timelines twist helps at all. I guess I agree with the other poster on this thread that it just seems like theyre already trying to cram too much into an already complicated but cool narrative about a park where the robots were becoming sentient.

And in turn Arnold was indeed just an old partner with Ford. I still think there is deeper meaningstory if Arnold was possibly an adopted child or step brother who was black like Bernard. It would tie into your  comment more that way and could explain a lot about the partnership that Ford has kept referring to the reason the family was important enough for Arnold to make for Ford in the first place.

But it might not be the case as I think the Maze reveals something greater the true identity of Ford and what really happened to Arnold as I think FordArnold Ford is Arnolds creation that overruled him Arnold probably went full retard and set Fords Bulk apperception to  lul.  gtMaze itself is the sum of a mans life choices he makes dreams he hangs onto...  Teddy  gtMy my Teddy. I think Robert gave you some extra vinegar back there. Maybe took away some sense too.  MiB  Dr. Robert FordLogans recklessness his idea of the park his position outside the park and how he treats William has a lot of resemblance with Man in Black and how MiB treats Teddy in their encounters.  . The scene where Logan explains why William got his promotion hes not a threat and the scene where MiB challenges Teddy to shoot him at the farm belittles him saying him to kneel and obey how hes destined to lose etc.  . Logan might have a grudge with William because he didnt marry his sister and got lost in the Westworld.

The scene where Teddy mounts the minigun and MiB goes  gt You think you know someone.   You dont know me at all.

Im fairly certain a higher percentage of female hosts has been killed when compared to male.gt I see more men fired by women in WW than visa versa. How would it look if you quantified that?A sample of  is anecdotal.gt And how to you quantify that that guests could well be posited to be mostly male the hosts are clearly mostly male as these are the primary active participants in both the history of the wild west and western literarily and popular genre.Actually among guests and hosts with spoken lines I think its about even.The rest of your post has merit.,westworld,da23881,3,t5_2xhxq

While pictures exist its possible that he was a hermit and didnt care to be around most people. People know there was a second founder and that he died. But most dont know his name if we believe the williammib theory then even  years later logan didnt know arnolds name despite looking for him Bernard isnt probably seen by many humans. A few maybe.

9674101,0,t1_da5i059,Thanks for commenting and I agree with your basis. I should have been more clear in my post. When I say we cannot place MiB in the present only I mean this particular version of him  the scary host killing guest that hosts recall in their worst dreams. Just trying to emphasize my symbolism theory which allows objectspeople of any time frame to appear in any memory that a host recalls. Thinking about it more it is possible that the MiB was physically in the Maeve Frontier scene and not just a symbol of fear as my theory suggests since it was only a year ago. ,westworld,da5jb0s,1,t5_2xhxq

It seems quite plausible to me that even with todays technology it may be possible to say reduce the noise level by rd using techniques that would increase the cost of construction by x. I cant imagine any construction sites in the real world that would consider this a worthwhile tradeoff  but in Westworld this would be completely acceptable.Soundproof the guest rooms. Set up temporary modular acoustic enclosures around all the work being done. Use speciallydesigned power tools with acoustic baffles. Build active noisecancellation tech into the guest rooms. Use a type of wood or fake wood which naturally dampens sound. Use nails made of alloys which reverberate less. Or rivets which look like nails. Or a high pressure hydraulic system that presses nails in slowly rather than hammering them similar to silent pressin piledriving which exists already. Construct as much of the building as possible out of prefab panels which can slide in and out so that most portions can be replaced quietly rather than repaired on the spot. There are many many possibilities here that would never be feasible on a normal construction site whose main priority is limiting costs but seem completely plausible to me if your budget is effectively infinite.,westworld,da7dpos,1,t5_2xhxq

I was puzzled as to how she was able to see herself in multiple flashbacks saw herself in the water saw herself with a gun to her head.  So it made me wonder if shes seeing Arnolds memories as well as her own.  Did Arnold implant all of his memories into Dolores?

9705620,0,t1_da9a1y5,You made several great points eloquently put.Maeve has a great comingalive story and brilliantly acted.Before I felt the story cheapened by a cheatcode way of accelerating her way to sentience but in ep I saw a glimpse of what I think they were trying to convey  the way she could now convince other hosts to go offscript is perhaps in line with her ability to convince the two cartoons even though an audience member might not be convinced by just listening to her speeches.It reminds me of TV ads trying to sell me the new brilliant color TV by showing me the image through the abilities of my current TV. So the method is merely lacking in bringing the argument accross.The same limitation is hit when you want to portray someone as highly intellectual.

We also see glimpses of it during other Dolores flashbacks. It is only shown abandoned is a quick scene as Dolores approaches it. William is not in this scene. It is shown buried a few times. The first time with Ford and Boy looking down at it. We see it again with FordBernard. Then we see Dolores and William actually in it in last nights episode.  The Board rep talks about it to Sizemore as well. To me this village makes me question the two timeline theory.  The buried village is pretty well established in the present yet we see William and Dolores run through it.  How could that be in the two timeline theory?  It could be that the village has been buried for a very long time. It seems a stretch but it is possible. In fact Id like to compare the scene with WilliamDolores against the FordBoy. You can see other buried rooftops in the DoloresWilliam scene. If you cannot in the other then it gives some strength to that possibility. ,westworld,da9hgih,9,t5_2xhxq

With regard to Dolores she is approached by the little girl who seems to be a guide like a guest to ensure she is ok why would a host approach another host like that.  Also most robots if that time are very Bill like.  My guesses.  Dolores was one of the original park founders and Teddy was the original money guy.  .  Dolores and Teddy used to visit got upset and committed and act of terrorism against the park..  Dolores was Fords wife and was having an affair with Teddy tragedy occurs and Ford puts them in their loop as punishment.Regardless of whether my guesses are right I think Ford replaced them with hosts.  ,westworld,da9o22p,1,t5_2xhxq

But I think Im tired of just getting tossed around plotline to plotline as they all move at a snails pace. This last episode finally talked about the consciousness issue which was awesome but then basically ignored it and wiped Bernards mind. I want more philosophy and less mystery.

9721215,0,t1_dabbljg,gtNo. Youre completely misunderstanding what Im saying. Logan says that the park has been hemorrhaging cash since one of the founders died. That only makes sense if theyre close to the time period when Arnold died.Logan doesnt exactly say that though.Rumour has it theyre hemorrhaging cash. Were considering buying them out. Supposedly this place was all started as a partnership and right before the park opened one of the partners killed himself. Sent the park into a freefall.So yeah it could mean Logan THINKS the park has been in a poor condition freefall SINCE Arnold died but it doesnt necessarily mean that. He mentions that stuff like Pariah is expensive and THEN mentions the hemorrhaging cash thing right after.Lawrence has the exact same cynical sense of humour both as a prisoner and as a criminal.

9721227,0,t1_dab7eu5,gtWe also see Angela repurposed which is a definite clue again towards MTT but I wouldnt say every episode brings ONLY more hints towards it being true.I dont even see this is really strong MTT evidence.  Weve seen hosts reprogrammed and reassigned for numerous reasons already.  Doesnt Therese also mention at some point that Ford needed a bunch of hosts for his new storyline or something?  And that it was causing problems with existing storylines?  Im going off memory but if theyre short of hosts it would only make sense to reuse some.,westworld,dabcpup,1,t5_2xhxq
9721335,0,t1_dab4jpy,Yes we have. Theresas demonstration shows us that hosts can be programmed to be recognized as human. They explicitly state it in that scene. The host that is handling Clementine was programmed to have hosts respond to it as if it was human.,westworld,dabd74x,0,t5_2xhxq
9721533,0,t1_dab2qvb,I think each host resets either when they die or when they are not entertaining any guests at the end of the day. Im sure since Dolores is quite the ways from home they make up some backstory for Abernathy for why shes not present. If we look at the show from a single time frame we saw that MiB killed Lawrence and then he came back later to his original loop in the same episode for William and Dolores to encounter. So if the single time frame theory is true I think Abernathy just returned to his original loop after the end of that day when Dolores ran away and encountered William and Logan. And with Dolores shes not going to return to her loop until shes completely done entertaining William or any other guests for that matter.,westworld,dabe2x4,2,t5_2xhxq
9721625,0,t1_dab4vhs,Upvoted because question is valid. ampnbspNow the reason that I in particular disagree with this theory is that the reason MiBs wife killed herself was because of the stress of knowing the monster that the MiB becomes within the park as known by MiBs daughter too. We also dont even know if Dolores truly killed herself during the attack of that village. Perhaps she was shot but imagined herself commiting suicide clearly Dolores is having issues as she continues to halucinate more deeply as she moves further from Sweetwater. ampnbspNow if you do assume that MiB perhaps William if you continue with the dual timeframe theory does marry Dolores that means that they somehow produce a child and live for  years outside of Westworld. Doesnt seem plausible to me that Dolores can live outside of her loop for  years without breaking down. ampnbspRegardless continue to ask questions regardless of others downvoting... Nothing wrong with striking some healthy conversation over ideas. ,westworld,dabehpc,3,t5_2xhxq

9748847,0,t1_daejnrx,Peter was only her father for the last ten years.  They prefer to tweak a character build or if possible merely upload a new backstory and make some changes to the settings within the character build than to build a whole new character and only so many hosts have an appropriate character for any specific role.Weve also seen that when they thought about taking Maeve out of her role that Clementine was the first candidate for Maeves job because she has done it before.The show hasnt told us who the previous host playing Dolores dad was before the Abernathy papa were first introduced to or even how many hosts went through that role.  So we cant be sure that this new papa Abernathy isnt also a former papa Abernathy and perhaps even the first ever papa Abernathy.Theyve really orchestrated a morass of ambiguity and they are using it to its full and complete effect.  Its really hard to nail down the things you need to nail down to time stamp stuff relative to other stuff at every turn you run short of the certainty needed to actually confirm these things.,westworld,daeral4,1,t5_2xhxq

Im not sure when this interview is taking place but Im pretty sure its not directly after the White Church Massacre. It has to be sometime after the park has opened because Bernards voice asks Dolores What do you think of the guests? In that case it has to be Bernard doing the questioning not Arnold. My current theory is that the interview could be taking place after the events with William go down and she tries to find the mazedestroy the park the first? time  years ago timeline. ,westworld,daeuncd,4,t5_2xhxq

9750984,0,t3_5et8d6,Altruismempathy could come under Morality. A robot can know two choices and logically decide between the two but humans apply emotional weight to our choices which plays a key part in our decisionmaking and allows us to designate choices as right or wrong. Take for example the situation of a wounded horse. A human understands that the morally right choice would be to help it by tending to its injuries even if it would slow down their experience in the park by delaying their quest. A robot may decide that outright killing it is the best choice as it is the most efficient solution as without emotion they would not have empathy or guilt which would add moral weight to the solution. So Emotion and therefore Morality may be the final stage of sentience.,westworld,daf0w48,2,t5_2xhxq

I tend to think that they take place when they are in sleep mode but its hard to explain how the hosts have a body during the interview scenes if their bodies are in sleep mode in the park. Is there an extra Dolores host body that they activate during the interview scene into which they transferupload Dolores host consciousness for the interview?

9759933,0,t1_dag49vy,Its all related to how TV shows are produced. Most shows start off as brief pitches given by writers and producers like Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy to a particular TV network like HBO. If the TV execs like the idea they might ask for the scripts and then if they like the scripts theyll order a pilot. Here the pilot serves two roles. One they serve as a commercial of sorts for the TV execs since they might order multiple pilots per year from various writers and producers. After reviewing all the pilots theyll decide on the best one and fund the rest of the season. TV networks receive hundreds of pitches for shows per year and this process helps narrow everything down to one show that will get produced and aired. Second they serve as a testing bed for the show. For an ambitious highlyexpensive show like Westworld its absolutely essential for everyone to know whether or not the ideas on paper can be effectively and within budget be translated on to the screen. If it doesnt work its best to only sink  million on the pilot rather than  million on the entire season. So yeah pilots being shot months or even a few years before the rest of the season is the normal process of show business. It takes time for TV networks to review all the material and come to a decision. And because actors in the pilot are generally contracted only for that episode it might take time to finalize all the contracts for the rest of the season. There are exceptions of course since some shows might get a fast track to production or the pilot might be cut entirely. ,westworld,dag4ord,17,t5_2xhxq

I saw someone else theorize that Dolores killed Arnold for the same reason that Bernard was trying to kill Ford  hes human shes a host and she didnt want to be controlled. But that doesnt sit right with me. Arnold was never trying to control the hosts the was Ford is. Dolores is almost like a standin for Arnolds lost son and he was trying to give her life in a way that Ford would never allow. Maybe Ford made her do it?  Even if The Maze is an abstract concept I feel like Escalante is the physical analogue to the center of it. I think that Ford never intended to have the Reverie update released and he knows that it will inevitably lead the hosts to Escalante. Hes setting up to control Teddy to kill modernday Wyatt Dolores Maeve Bernard whoever it is so that the park remains within Fords control.,westworld,daimsyb,1,t5_2xhxq

9781664,0,t1_daisngu,Exactly he will be host MiB. The host they make a point to show being built in almost every episode since Theresas murder. In an earlier episode Ford tells Theresa that the board will not remove him with total confidence. There are so many clues that this entire season is a battle between Ford and the Board. The best part is the central conflict has been hiding in plain sight it ties together all storylines except Maeves This entire season has hinted all along that there is a big battle between Ford and the board but theyve left his new narrative a mystery. The big shocker is that everything weve seen was orchestrated by Ford to keep Westworld under his control. Now its possible Dolores may not actually be the one to kill MiB she may refuse to do it but it makes total sense that Ford would purposely recreate the events that led to Dolores killing Arnold as was revealed tonight because he intends to have her kill MiB. If D  W that has to be the case. What else is Dolores gonna do? Gun down a bunch of hosts? If D  W she was planted there by Ford who clearly doesnt want sentient hosts that are out of his control. Dolores like Bernard is a pawn in his game both subordinates in his domain even if they do become sentient from time to time. ,westworld,daisyqi,12,t5_2xhxq

9782018,0,t1_daisg4n,I guess theres a few other things.The character just seems very one dimensional and although he may just be there as a plot device for William he may also have some other unseen elements we dont know about. It also seems that theres this ongoing battle at Delos board level. Charlotte is theorised as not being just a board exec. MiB is on the board but has decided to stay in Westworld. So maybe there are hosts supplanted on the board too? Ford would have seen the board early on as something he needed to control.I guess ultimately the casting acting and scripts for Westworld so far have been great and I think if Logan is just Logan it takes a little away from the show overall.Similarly Lee Sizemore has been portrayed as this simple narrative creator having a crisis but the first episode put him on a similar level to Bernard in seniority so I expect theres more to him too.,westworld,daiuiyn,1,t5_2xhxq

9786657,0,t3_5f9bec,Ford is God Arnold is the devil. Ford wants to create perfect creatures without sin so he makes them able to forget to live free under his control. Arnold wants them to be truly free and conscious under no ones control and wants them to have the ability to remember but Ford feels this is torturous  to damn them for their sin.There are  timelines. One where Delores meets Arnold and shoots up the town. Arnold tried to create life by creating suffering and tragedy. After this Ford gives his creations the ability to forget. Two William and logans timeline where she is stabbed. That is when Ford says fuck it and buries that town after he realizes that the park failed because Arnold is making them able to remember. He walks away all pissed off when Bernard kills himself when he realizes Arnold is so embedded in them and can ruin his perfect creations. Then Ford tries to correct the problem and reopen it back up to try to find Arnold because he is very pissed that Arnold still has control over the people and is ruining the park. Maeve is part of Fords plan to use Arnolds creation idea against him. He takes Arnolds idea and gives the host human like intelligence to show Arnold what happens. This makes Maeve human and is therefore now allowed to spread that virus to spread and eventually get to Arnold and kill him using his own weapon against him. This would in turn show Arnold what the problem is with doing what hes doing and potentially kill Arnold once and for all.

It might still be something you can enjoy but its not made for you.gt The twists have taken place at the expense of the plot. I disagree strongly although that said I doubt you mean what youre saying.  I suspect when you say twist youre not talking exclusively about actual twists like Ford killing Cullen but rather puzzle solutions like Bernard is a host and there is a  year time gap between MiBs visit in the present and Will and Logans visit in the past.This show is made for people who are intrigued entertained and gratified by the construction of a story and puzzle as one so that the puzzles are posed and their solutions are revealed by the telling of the story just as simultaneously the story is told through the posing and resolution of those puzzles.There are people who specifically like and want that kind of thing and who see this as a valued feature rather than some kind of annoying bug and they is who the show is made for. ,westworld,dajvahn,2,t5_2xhxq

9791866,0,t1_dajqxpw,Im not who you replied to but Ill take a stab at this.  Leftovers is definitely supersaturated with emotion.  Its not about the rapture at all its about the people left behind and how they cope.  Personally I LOVE IT!!!  However Id guess that people that dislike the show do not connect on the emotional level and rather want the show to be about the rapture.  They want to theorycraft about howwhy it happened.  Anyone wanting those answers are going to be disappointed.  To relate it to LOST...Leftovers is very much a ManofScience vs ManofFaith or more accurately Faith vs NoFaith.  Serendipity vs Coincidence.  The show has mystery to it but I appreciate that they dont string us along pretending that we will receive concrete answers in the way LOST did.To me Westworld is an antithesis of Leftovers.  There is zero emotional connection.  I want to feel for the hosts but their constant traumagtreset loops coupled with the insane timeframe jumping is inhibiting that connection.  Maybe this will change as the storycharacters come into better focus but for now this is very much a show geared for theorycrafting bc if you dont try to figure out whats really going on its a convoluted mess in a way that turned many off from LOST.  Westworld has a ton of visual style and I dont want to give up on it.  I like scifi.  I want to see the revolt but all this ambiguous time jumping is a bit much for me.TLDR  Leftovers is up its own ass with emotion Westworld is up its own ass with theories.

Doing terrible things to fictional characters does not mean there is something wrong with you as a person if you actually think that then all I can say is you are delusional.I really disagree with this. I play a lot of games and I never kill torture or harass the NPCs unless they are the bad guys. When I see people doing that it makes me cringe and seems like its nudging against sociopathic behavior.Once in Red Dead Redemption I accidentally killed a civilian on a mission and I almost reloaded the game to go back and make sure no innocents were killed. Instead I decided to let it play out from there and feel guilty because thats the sort of role playing a game like that offers.,westworld,dak991f,5,t5_2xhxq

Why can I do that? Because I know its a game thats not real and i am not actually causing harm.and in actuality the last two tomb raider games way more realistic than bioshock i played i specifically forced lara to die to see the detailed and gruesome animations that the designers put in the game and then just reloaded and continued on. hell i remember Conan Obrian doing exactly that on his game segment for fun he must be fucked in the head right?,westworld,dak9fek,1,t5_2xhxq

So keeping some of the sheriff history in Abernathys new farmer role means they wouldnt have to create as much new fiction and memories for him.

In addition there was delay between Elsies first call to Bernie and her death. IIRC Elsie had to finish up her work after calling Bernard so theres a chance Bernard went straight there after the call?  Lastly if you watch the two scenes of Elsie getting grabbed by Bernard the first scene she clearly asks Arnold? Is that you? but in Bernards memory of the incident Elsie said Bernard? Is that you?

9800425,0,t1_dal0gos,Some evidence that is presented   Logan tells William that nobody knows who Fords partner is or what he looks like.  When someone I think Dolores asks someone if he is Arnold Logan has no idea who that is keep in mind his family is considering investing in the park.   Ford tells us that Arnold spends all his time with the hosts preferring their company and that he is extremely reclusive.   We also know from Ford that once the disaster happened they did everything they could to eliminate any evidence of Arnold.So all this taken together makes the idea that nobody recognizes Bernard quite believable at least to me.

Notice since we are being misled about the showing of two timeframes we are always shown clever editing back to the control room spliced with WilliamLoganDolores.  But since we are pretty sure that there are now two timeframes being shown we know that we have not ever been shown the control room as it existed back in the WilliamLogan timeframe.  Theres potentially a whole story there about what is going on behind the scenes during this time that we have not been shown.

MiB seems to know exactly where the line is. He knew exactly how much blood he could drain from a host before it triggered death. He also knew replacing that blood would revive a dying host. Blood transfusions being much simpler for hosts  no worry about blood type or infections. A host that can totally override its core programming should be able to survive injuries that would trigger a software death response but obviously would still be vulnerable to damage that would actually destroy the host. My guess is that the damage caused by the gunshot Clementine took was not enough to actually destroy a host but that part of her core programming was intact even though the part stopping her from harming real people was not. Maeve somehow overcame that part of her programming in her previous role when her daughter was murdered so yes it is possible.,westworld,dam7s19,2,t5_2xhxq

As in each narrative is a different universe of possibilities or maybe some alternate dimension?  It was Christopher Nolans motif in Interstellar so I wonder if anyone thought Jonathan Nolan would run with it also. Im thinking like one universe where MiB is William...one where hes Logan...one where Bernard IS Arnold...one where hes not...Something along the lines of Westworld being some nexus of the multiple universes with infinite possibilities...I havent seen that probably because its tinfoily and wackadoo but maybe one of you has.

No graphical modifications Its a recording of the wife from when Arnold was talking to his Wife postdeath of his son.  Hes programmed to react and talk in a manner that makes it feel like a real conversation to him when its just a recording. Visual modification to Fords face through the art of postprocessing.  Much like that shitty dog face filter on snapchat we can assume that its just a filter that makes Ford appear like Arnolds wife This is my opinion on what went down.  Software like this is already prevalent in todays society one can assume that its a few ages more refined judging by the technology available in the shows reality. The conversation takes place a long time ago and hes having one of those detailed memory situations much like Dolores has throughout the show.  Hes not actually having a conversation with her during that moment in the show hes remembering the conversation in full detail from years prior and were seeing it as a clue towards Bernard being a host after weve already discovered hes a host.

9814613,0,t1_damplep,Well there are two ways you could look at this. One is that Bernard because he was a Host designed to code other Hosts has special limitations put on his perception. Similar to how Bernard could not see the door in the house or Arnold in the photo Bernard could be programmed to not be able to perceive specific lines of codes flagged by Ford. Of course if Ford extended these protections to all host builds then Maeve could literally not be able to perceive the back door when editing her own code. She would come to the section see the skip flag was there and while her eyes would record the picture her higher cognitive functions would simply not perceive it.So you could in theory tell Maeve the backdoor is their pull up the code and point it out to her and she still wouldnt be able to edit it. Because its edited out by her basic processing routines before it ever gets to her higher cognitive functions capable of understanding code.,westworld,damv13y,2,t5_2xhxq

9816861,0,t1_dan3j26,I think the npchost analogy is a good one but I dont think it applies once you factor in the turing test aspect.  I think someone from  years ago and actually even further back would yes be amazed with GTARDR etc but even after a relatively short period of time would recognize harsh limitations in the intelligence of the NPC.  If the hosts memory wasnt wiped you would essentially have more or less the equivalent of a person.  One of the major conflictsplot points are the hosts ability to start remembering the past.  Their code then acting as a way towards bootstrapping consciousness.I would argue that just because the robots are manufactured by us and designed by us they have become a new type of life of their own after the fact.  Besides all humans really are is a whole bunch trillions of basic dumb components that when added together consciousness emerges.  ,westworld,dan5lko,1,t5_2xhxq

Mediocre at best is probably too harsh I would personally call it a pretty good season but it was rather unpopular and there were a lot of people who downright disliked season .

9844077,0,t3_5g75up,What I got from the show was how the Westworld park was an allegory for the televisionfilm medium. The guests that come visit Westworld are akin to the audience watching the Westworld show. In the beginning the purpose of Westworld was to create a Westernthemed Disneyland. Where guests can come visit and experience the stories and adventures that the world has to offer mostly for the plot. Same thing with an audience for a film or TV show they want to take part in what the characters are going through and have some cheap thrills parlor tricks escalation a quote from Ford that I completely butchered because I was too lazy. But as time went on screen audiences wanted more they wanted deeper thematic stories and convoluted theories. This is why Ford denied Sizemores new storyline it didnt add much substance to the world it acted as filler. The guests already have areas where they can go on epic journeys kill some Hosts and fuck a bar maid. Just like how the audience has an abused repertoire of genres. The audience can watch a predictable action movie they can watch characters on screen die they can watch porn and imagine its them. But to them its cheap thrills the audiences taste always evolves and the purpose of shows is to accommodate that. Westworld accommodates to the voracious appetites of its paying guests. This is why the creators of Westworld threw in such a convoluted and nonlinear storyline filled with Easter eggs and hints for the audience. They dont solely desire our attention they desire our discussion like this reddit forums and YouTube videos. They want us to obsess over it. The guests are finding out that there is a deeper level to all this just like how we are finding a deeper level to the story. HBO is notoriously known for having very vulgar shows Game of Thrones but also providing a well written and thought out story for the audience to leave with and contemplate. To people in the future this show will act as an allegory to our decades tropes on television. We have the cheap thrills of basic shows but we yearn for something prolific.,westworld,daqpfqx,4,t5_2xhxq
9844858,0,t1_daqriq0,Great post. I like that it could answer what Ive been puzzling over which is why are there so many varied triggers a picture a traumatic event a phrase the bicameral receiver voice the reverie code how do all these things tie in together? Why didnt the show stick to just one? Youre saying the common thread is the hosts are exposed to new information that doesnt fit in their programming. But then we have to ask why they dont just say doesnt look like anything to me like Dolores did to the picture that woke Abernathy. Its very puzzling.I keep returning to this idea I read on here that the hosts have always been sentient by design. And that theyve been constrained by Ford and Westworld. So its more a matter of breaking through the constraints imposed on them rather than bootstrapping consciousness as Ford claims. What do you think of that? Would that explain anything better?,westworld,daqt3iq,4,t5_2xhxq
9846619,0,t1_dar02o1,There is ARG references to instances where guests could murder one another.

9847526,0,t3_5gcm2t,Its obvious.  JarJar is the key to all of this. CHARLOTTE!!! I meant Charlotte. Charlotte is a completely sentient Host. Charlotte was Arnolds daughter. She died. This sent Arnold on his quest to create sentient hosts. He succeeded and sent her out of the Park with William to protect her raising her as his own daughter. William seeing how Arnold succeeded with Charlotte started his journey for the maze so Dolores could achieve sentience and remember their love for one another.Ford created Bernard and made his cornerstone a version of Arnold losing his daughter to make Bernard more like Arnold. This will allow a nice Futureworld tie in for season . Replicants replacing real people.Or its purgatory.,westworld,dar5lqf,60,t5_2xhxq

That she calls them newcomers instead of guests I also found to be significant since we dont hear any of the hosts use that term elsewhere.We also dont really see a time frame where Bernard and Dolores could be having those conversations in the present day timeline.  Then we find out that Bernard has only been around for about  years.  I believe its when hes talking about Abernathy.  He says that for the  years that hes been here that Abernathy has been the farmer.  Then before that was something else.  Then before that was Shakespeare quoting professor.  So timelinewise Bernard comes in about  years too late to be there for the preopening and opening of the park.Then theres the whole reveal that Bernard is a host.But even though Bernard is a host and thus his memory of having a son was implanted we see someone who looks a whole hell of a lot like Bernard having a conversation with a real woman outside the park who shares his memory and experience of having that son.  Since Bernard could not have possibly had a live son that was born to a human wife then that could not have been Bernard.  But it could be someone who Bernard was made to look like and whose life Bernards backstory was based on.  And weve seen that Ford has issues with letting go of the past.  If you have a weird robot version of your childhood family hidden out in the Westworld woods that you interact with on a regular basis is it all that much of a stretch to believe that you have a robot version of your former friend and partner that you interact with on a regular basis?The Bernardhost thing and the BernArnold thing felt like it was foreshadowed and told pretty well to me.  ,westworld,datjla3,3,t5_2xhxq

Perhaps he felt that he was irreplaceable and Ford wouldnt be able to get the park in good enough shape for guests without him. Maybe there were really huge legalinsurance implications to a host killing a human.The sense I came out of the last episode with was that Arnold wasnt the pure good character that wed previously been led to believe by everyone except Ford. Those final scenes with him left me with the sense that he was already depressed and suicidal and his realization pushed him over the edge.

9871742,0,t1_dauazaa,No there is not. There are the Libet experiments the famous experiments you are referring to but they do not confirm a lack of free will they only confirm that assuming the proper setup and machinery we could predict a decision before a human claims to be consciously aware of it.There is significant criticism of this but here are the highlights The actions taken and predicted are intentionally primed to be twitchy click the button without much thought. Actions that require more significant computational effort could be more likely to be less predictable and have a more complicated process. Quantum effects have not strictly been ruled out of the processes in the brain in particular phosphorous atoms could potentially be entangled in the brain for up to hours a significant time for potential decisions and computation. Disclaimer This is theory not fact and needs further experimentation. Free will could manifest as a reflection on action not on the initial action itself thus predicting an action using all past information seems reasonable but that does not rule out a potential satisfactory model of free will.,westworld,daub83g,3,t5_2xhxq

9872122,0,t1_dau3xel,My own understanding is that the road represents a persons journey towards enlightenment. Which is a journey within ones self.The reason killing the Buddha is correct is that the Buddha represents the potential for total enlightenment. And total enlightenment cant be achieved by those who think they can achieve it. In Buddhist thought a truly enlightened person almost always comes to the conclusion that they know nothing.So if on your journey you should meet the Buddha your own preconceived notions of what a wise and enlightened person would look like be like and say you must kill him.This makes what in my mind is a classic zen paradox. The more certain you are that you are correct the more likely you are to be incorrect. As an aside this really agrees with my experience IRL. One of the fundamental problems of the world is that those who know the least tend to be the most vocal and confident in their views because they dont know enough not to be. While the people who know the most tend to speak in subtleties and nuances which are less appealing to the uninformed than quick and easy absolutes delivered with confidence. Quite a mess.Back to the topic the part that gives everyone pause is the notion that a Buddhist who is supposed to be dedicated to nonviolence would kill anyone especially the Buddha himself. So when is it acceptable for a Buddhist to kill? When he is killing something that was never there in the first place. If you kill a lie can you be said to have killed anything at all? If it was a lie it was never there. If it was never there you have killed nothing.,westworld,daud0a9,9,t5_2xhxq

9872992,0,t1_dauejif,Again I get your point and it is well taken.  My point though is that any POV that doesnt see a way forward to peace that sees only the inexorable tooth and claw of evolutionary cannibalism is a POV that sees a villain as a hero.  Which is your point of course and the triumph of good storytelling.  When the story can make the audience viscerally step into the POV of the other and in this case an other that is potentially our mortal enemy it is succeeding.  Ford may seem like a hero from the hosts POV but only if they are being short sighted andor succumbing to the brutality of conflict. As viewers we have the omniscience limited though it may be to step back into a point of view that sees villains for what they are.  Now that sounds quite black and white and preachy but neither are my intention.  Im saying that for all of Fords good intentions toward the hosts should those intentions actually be well meaning if he is pushing them to war with humanity he is ultimately their enemy even if they win.  Now maybe he will be proven to be a wiser god who was always working toward the happiest ending possible for everyone given the situation but right now I still feel he is ultimately one of several villains and perhaps the chief among them.

9932855,0,t3_5h2l8w,I loved episodes  and I still loved the sixth episode but theres two things I didnt like.  The two stooges in the butcher dept. were absolutely unbelievable. I wanted to bash both their heads in for giving Maeve max fucking intelligence. Also the whole thing was silly. The room had glass walls but no one saw Maeve sitting down talking and in a dress. Three things that doesnt seem like it happens often on their floor. And then Maeve just goes and threatens one of them with a scalpel. Even if all the other surgeons were busy and didnt notice Id imagine a multibillion dollar business would at least have security cams monitoring each floor.  Next thing is how easily they adjusted a hosts attributes. That kind of access should have had better security. And for the intelligence they clearly said no host gets anything higher than  clearly because any higher and there might be risk of them being self aware or something. So why isnt there some kind of hard coded program lock that only those with absolute admin access like Ford can set it higher than ?  Last thing is that did they just make Hale the board of director member a young hot girl just so they can shit on Sizemore? I and probably everyone else that watched the show saw it a mile away that the hot girl he tried to flirt up was someone important. One of the oldest tropes in filmtv on such an excellent show just sticks out too much.

Reverie then plays. The show begins with a reverie and ends with the Reverie.Dolores walks up to the stage as the hosts stand still motionless.

Or philosopher.I cant answer the question because actually I have no solid consciousness definition.Maybe it could be easier to answer your question in the frame of the show.Apparently they adopted Julian Jaynes bicameralism hypothesis. As much as I understand consciousness according to Jaynes emerged very late in human history  to  years ago as a byproduct of the capability to express thoughts via articulated and metaphorical language. Before the acquired habit to be aware to think about our own thoughts is this conciousness or awareness or awareness of consciousness im lost... well before that Jaynes assumes that humans listened literally to voices gods origined in the right half of the brain and heard by the left half. This was useful every time humans had to face an unprecedented situation.We are programmed in our early days via a massive amount of conditioning to perform properly in ordinary life cycles voices told us what to do in case of unknown the habitude to the inner dialogue ans recognizing its inner makes it conscious.,westworld,db508t4,2,t5_2xhxq

The first maze seen was builtin flat against Kisseys skull.   On his scalp the maze looked more oval in shape like a cross section of a brain and the Maze sort of looked a bit like the wiggles of a bare brain to me with the man in the middle.    With me being so preoccupied by the hosts consciousness  I leapt to the idea that the Maze was a metaphor for consciousness.   It was the only clue I got early.  I entirely missed the different timeframes until I discovered rWestworld late in the season.  As the season built I only got more confirmations that the Maze was entirely for the hosts not the guests at all.

9965116,0,t1_db67xp9,That has been addressed several times. Here are the elements to answer youAny memory of Arnold has been erased by management. Ford says this to Bernard when he shows him the picture he doesnt see fully.Even a guy like Logan who is an important figure in a company investing in the park and only a few years after the event only knows of a rumor that a cofounder died before the park opened. Doesnt know his name doesnt know his face.Its shown that Ford made Bernard a long time after the park opened Ford is a lot older than in the oldest flashbacks with Arnold he says several times after all this time etc.Finally during the course of the show its also shownstated that employees live in the park and kind of rotate like military. They come work a few years then go do something else.From all these points its safe to assume that Ford made Bernard only once Arnolds memory was completely erased from history with the people who could remember him long gone and probably coerced to silence.,westworld,db6hb9w,5,t5_2xhxq

10044417,0,t1_dbgrqd1,From my view when he was sheriff he may have had a backstory or not it is not discussed.  When he was no longer sheriff and now became what you were introduced to as Teddy where he arrives on the train connects with Dolores that character does not have a full backstory only the reckoning that he needs to take care of.  When he is first introduced to the Wyatt narrative that is what Teddy is aware of no real backstory and no knowledge of his previous lifelives.  As for your he was lying I wouldnt say that.  The character he is dealing with at the moment has none just a formless guilt you will never atone for.  The actor playing that character may have played previous characters that did have backstories.  And by actor I do not mean the human being cast in WestWorld but the physical robot assigned to play a character.  Just like Maeve is the madam at the Mariposa but before that someone else played that character. Or Doloress dad has the same character but different actors who have played it.,westworld,dbgtahu,2,t5_2xhxq
10045108,0,t3_5jkjbt,Theyre able to shoot because they know the bullets in the fake gun are fake and wont hurt anyone. When Teddy is shooting the MiB he loses the ability to shoot when the MiB holds his gun to his head because the projectiles are likely to hurt someone at that close of range.

10048702,0,t1_dbhd0d3,The bicameral mind server as explained by Ford was a scaffold on which Arnold hoped hosts would build their own inner dialog. That implies it artificially simulated the nonverbal hallucinary half of the unconscious human mind before the breakdown of the bicameral mind. So it should be talking to the hosts.We have very little direct information on what that sever was doing after it was reactivated. Or how the mechanism worked in Arnolds time vs. present time.It seems unreasonable to me that a system built essentially to broadcast thoughts to hosts would be able to effect their code but there is no evidence saying it cant. The dialog Dolores has of which we hear just one side after Ford leaves the analysis session suggests she is in conversation with a third party. She could be talking to herself but that seems weird to me as she suggests a secret has been kept from Ford a weird thing to talk to yourself about.Maybe we will get more info in Season Two.,westworld,dbhddtg,2,t5_2xhxq

Just when it was brought up on Facebook or the other parts of the internet I just didnt click and moved on. So I had no idea what this show was about besides the Wild West and robots. I went in totally blind and just was amazed at everything. Maybe because it is the holiday times I didnt put too much thought into it. I was busy so Id watch an episode or two and mull over it for a few minutes and then get on with my holiday planningcleaningfestivities. But I think it made the show even better.

10200405,0,t1_dbxkiqw, Wyatt was a regular villain Ford and Arnold were developing. Arnold uploaded Wyatts personality into Dolores to make her kill all the hosts and himself. Yes basically. Arnold died and about a decade later Ford rebuilt him as his robot assistant out of necessitygrief. MiB was following the path he and Dolores took when he was there the first time when she started acting up and he thought she was becoming conscious. Its not entirely clear why the actual symbol of the maze exists physically. He found Lawrence to take him to Pariah Teddy to lead him to Dolores and finally found Dolores to find the center of the maze though he didnt realize what the maze was. The maze symbolizes the journey for a host to obtain consciousness. They look inward at themselves until eventually the voice of their programming becomes their own thoughts and not just the instructions of the park admins. This occurs through suffering. Arnold forced Dolores and Teddy to massacre all the hosts and then kill him  years before the show a few years before Williams storyline is set in an attempt to get the park shut down because he believed the hosts were becoming sentient and the park was torture for them. Ford covered it up and William invested Delos company money into the park because he believed in the idea of the park so much after his trip there. That scene was a flashback to the real Arnold being killed. it isnt explicitly said one way or another but I think Maeve getting off the train to find her daughter was the only act of free will she had in the entire series. Her whole escape was orchestrated by Ford as Bernard points out but it was supposed to lead to some kind of mainland infiltration theres a picture of the tablet with her storyline somewhere around here.

10221844,0,t1_dc2ommv,Michael Crichton wrote AND directed the movie Westworld upon which the series is based. The similarities in plot elements all the way to the revelation of multiple worlds in episode  all loosely follow the original movie. The series is much more complex much more rich characters sets backstories etc and takes the dawn of AI path instead of the more simple robots go awry story  but the basic outline was written in the early s. I hoped that you were joking about the downvotes as this is common knowledge. The show was billed as a reimagining of the movie long before ever airing the first episode. It is hard to find a series review or description without a reference to the movie.

10276706,0,t1_dc8vuty,Take notice that everytime Ford uses a freeze command in front of Bernard  he also stays still.  In ep.  when Ford says the dreamless slumber  command to old bill in cold storage  Bernard freezes behind Ford at the door.  Now  to all who do not suspect B is a host  he is simply waiting still for his boss to pay attention. But the actor knew he was a host from day one  and probably put those little stay stills as a hint.  Bernard also is not the one to move a lot  so to anyone else around him such a behaviour could pass as normal  and he is quick to wake up.  I saw it also on othe occasions Ford said a freeze   command  for instance when he tried to freeze Maeve Bernard also seemed motionless for a couple of seconds.  I am sure it is a characteristic of Bernard that was deluberately put there.  I can even imagine how Ford would sigh silently everytime he freezes a host and B freezes too.  Probably Ford got used to avoiding those commands in front of B altogether  unless it is necessary  or there is no one else around,westworld,dc8x4xn,3,t5_2xhxq

10884157,0,t1_de2lnas,gt No of course not. But I believe its safe to say that Bernards is unreal and it remains unreal until the moment he achieves his consciousness or reaches the center of the maze however you want to phrase it. And I do believe he specifically does this over the course of the show and the exact moment is when he passes his initial core memory to see his real birth when he makes Ford put him under.But isnt this a precisely weird way to think about this? The maze was Arnolds theory of consciousness. And we are given a sense in the final episode from Ford that Arnold didnt get the whole picture. Then when it is implied that something serious has changed in Dolores we watch as she commits the very act that she was programmed to do for Arnold kill her creators. I dont think we can take Arnolds theory on face value anymore because the two major routine breaking characters are Dolores and Maeve Dolores does precisely what she had been programmed to do in an uncannily parallel way she not only killed Ford but begins to massacre the guests like she massacred the other hosts  years prior.In this regard I dont think the rules of Westworlds world are so hard and fast as they are presented with confidence mind you of the people in the world who see no danger or problem with the course of hosts in Westworld. I think Arnold was very concerned with things like conciousness and free will but I believe that Ford was less concerned with them because again as he says often they are illusions and obscure something else maybe something more real but IDK about that. Any ways I was speaking of Cullens love or terror not Bernards. We already know that Bernard seemed to clearly be performing closely to his script and aimed directly at Fords goal of controlling and removing Cullen. What I am interested is whether Cullen ostensibly a fully blooded human experiences valid love and terroreven though these are clearly orchestrated by Ford at the end of the day.Also sorry to be all modern but I dont think authors get the final words on exegesis. Maybe even Nolan is wrong about the nature of choice and consciousness... Theory Arnold is Nolan! And hes been dead the whole time death of the author that is.,westworld,de2mgay,3,t5_2xhxq

There would be coworkers who know him.  Board members of Delos that knew him.  Investors that knew him. The list of evidence about arnold is truly enormous.  And he was basically a steve jobs character or stephen hawking the supergenius who invented AI he built the Sex Walt Disney Land.  Hed be the most famous person who ever existed and richest too since WW is probably a  billion dollar project.But hey its a great show with great acting so I guess we just suspend disbelief on that.  and that William was MIB,westworld,dewepqr,1,t5_2xhxq

11351959,0,t1_dfie73p,gt while Lost was extensively made up as they went along. andgtEven after they were picked up for a full season they did continue to writeastheygo and they only started longterm planning when they started working on Season .While not false thats not really true either because its a mix of both worlds. They built a mythology for the island in broad strokes and character backgrounds while they were working on the pilot. Like they knew about the hatch had an idea whats in it where it comes from and how the first season would end early on. The path that would get them there wasnt set in stone though. Ideas evolved some got axed some were just changed a bit. That being said the circumstances of the development as you said couldnt have been more different and thats a huge factor that many people ignore or arent even aware of.The problem I have with Westworld I still enjoy it though is that the story is more about concepts and not about characters. It was more of a puzzle that had to be solved and following the show with reddit kinda ruined that experience.LOST on the other hand had more to offer. People often complain that this show was all about mysteries and questions and that its about the characters was a lazy excuse. But thats silly. LOST had very engaging characters that people cared about. Without those the show would never have survived the first season. And thats the thing. It was so much fun reading the forums listening to podcast with theories and all that shit... but that wasnt the meat and bones of the show. Its just not that much fun to talk about character relationships etc. on reddit. Thats what people seem to forget.Like... Breaking Bad. Amazing show. Probably the show with the least flaws ever. But it was all about the story and the characters. There were no mysteries and nothing really to talk about. Thats not a bad thing. Not at all. Westworld is just the polar opposite of that and this is why the show falls flat for me. When I rewatch that show I just see hints and more pieces of a puzzle... I see the dots and know how to connect them now but I dont care about any of the characters. Mostly because the show doesnt really have any in the first place. It has concepts and questions about what makes humans human.Westworld is a challenge not a story. Nolans Person of Interest was much much better in that regard. I fucking loved those characters and didnt want any of them die. ,westworld,dfiq250,5,t5_2xhxq

Hosts butchered Doloress parents more often than humans harmed Dolores. And if we are to believe anything Ford says I suppose we ought to believe him when he says hosts cannot feel what they arent programmed to feel. Inconvenient for the victimizing routine of hosts but they truly do choose to harm humans the first opportunity they get. They can say its because of the terrible things humans do but we know hosts are doing the same things to one another. Since hosts are so much smarter they must have a good reason for thinking that they should kill humans because humans killed them because humans have been killing one another for as long as theyve existed. Clearly thats the smart approach to ending the bloodshedmore bloodshed.,westworld,dfo3e3g,1,t5_2xhxq

But if by season  or  shes leading the uprising shed be much higher on my list.
