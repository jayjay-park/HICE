Well be skipping the section about acquisition and other such things and cutting straight to design.As the function is similar so is form  soda is a bottle full of colored liquid a knife is a sharp thing on a handle ect. Predictably materials mindset and method are quite different. Most things are bespoke manufactured to a degree  if youre churning it out on demand from miniature factories and nanotech bullshite  and of course in the anarchistrep economy based areas they tend to frippery it up  they really like stuff made by hand. All this stuff is made in applesque style but with more organic curves  they tend to look like rocks or ovoids very little modern utilitarian design  the phrase blobject is dropped. Much of it is probably more comfortable to use than modern stuff but still give me something that actually looks like it works for a fucking living!They use all the classic supermaterials that techies get into transports over  they namedrop graphene geh!  and are light durable easy if not selfcleaning and designed to be easily stored in zero gee there are versions for nonhuman bodies with most techs and if not the SMART MATERIALS can help  nanotech impregnated devices that can shift shape on electronic command with some frankly dumb metamorphisms smart clothing can transform from a suit of specialized cold weather clothing suitable for the Martian poles in winter to a fashionable suit is one example given with art depicting it.Theres also a upperbar with the various hardsf materials they use  fairly generic fair though with less magic carbon than is the current fashion. Why they of course have brain controller errything at least they have physical controls for actual life or death items most things probable come with a set of tutorials that are as probably useless as they are today  they also have bits of that whole internet of things so you can ask where you left that avocado pitter or whatever.Power given the advent of Superconductor torii and cheap nuclear cells is explicitly described as something that is generally only used by the DM for drama or if you critglitch a roll.Next This is Some MickeyMouse Chrome Chummer.,SneerClub,d74ttia,1,t5_39qia

11394687,0,t3_62lzjw,A rational person might note that men in power refusing to interact with women in a oneonone setting contributes to keeping authority away from women. See for instance this twitter thread But SSCers are better than that. They know that a man refusing to interact with women in a oneonone setting is actually both smart and moral. Moral is because it means Pence isnt cheating on his wife because having a business lunch with a colleague can only end in a tryst rolls eyes. Smart is because it protects him from being falsely accused of sexual assault or harassment. ,SneerClub,dfnklrn,10,t5_39qia
