2908282,0,t3_2t289d,Just a thought but how about we decided the challenge subject based on the season thats upon us each time? Like next challenge if its straight after this one could be Valentines Day related quilling around Easter we could make something to do with that and so on. Just thought Id put this out there  It would also give people ideas if someone wanted to send cards out or whatever! For instance poppies are a huge thing in the UK in November because of Remembrance Day.,quilling,cnyog6a,2,t5_2vspa

I did find a nice frame that came already matted and it had enough space between the glass and backing so it fits nicely. I found that one at Hobby Lobby for .I also bought a quilling pen.  I havent used it since the first try.  I felt like I had no control and it was way too fast.  Now I just try to enjoy the time it takes.  An exercise in patience.Have fun!!!,quilling,d7lni71,3,t5_2vspa
