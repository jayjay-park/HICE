4568299,0,t3_3dl5yk,I used the hood off a  gallon aquarium and put in a normal CFL bulb from the grocery store. Perfect amount of yellow light my chaeto thrives,Reef,ct6g30y,1,t5_2rgs0
6353143,0,t1_czbrb74,That makes sense. Buy a  new light fixture vs a  bulb. That wont be used but temporarily for a couple months.,Reef,czbs5rz,1,t5_2rgs0

9906142,0,t1_days3we,ThanksIt has been in my sump for  months now. Water is stable amp fish are healthy. My setup is approaching the two year mark. I have a high end skimmer huge uv light bio pellet reactor and a gfo reactor not being used i havent needed it for a very long time. I dont even do anything to it anymore. I just add rodi. No salt in almost a year and zero water changes in  months. I went from one extreme to the other. I used to do to much now i dont do anything but add water and dump skimmate. That has worked best for me. I plan on cleaning and performing maintenance in the next two weeks. ,Reef,dayskvd,2,t5_2rgs0
