3955992,0,t1_cr76oh7,When I was there there were two Phi Delta Theta and a friend of mine was in it. and Alpha Epison Pi I didnt know anyone in this frat.But the fraternity is not a Mcmaster organization and exists outside of the school. They arent allowed because they are inherently discriminatory and hence the Ontario Human rights Act doesnt approve them. Also there arent any sororities at mac so... Greek life is very limited but there if you want to partake in it.Id recommend searching for this stuff in MacInsiders forums. There are likely people who actually have better understanding.,McMaster,cr77ta9,2,t5_2r79x

4003434,0,t1_crcm00s,I believe Les Prince is the only res with single rooms. They are interspersed with double rooms and people will wander the halls. I was wokendisturbed maybe half a dozen times in the whole year mostly on fridaysaturday nights early in the semester before midtermsexams started. If youre looking for minimal activitynoise specify a single room as your first choice. ,McMaster,crcmff9,1,t5_2r79x

10707158,0,t3_5t4fty,Professors only allow people to write on different days to accommodate a min hr rest between midterms accommodation. Usually its a last resort since people who NEED this accommodation are encouraged by their disability coordinator to take a reduced courseload. You would think people ask their friends whats on midterms but people usually dont tell their friends they are writing on a different day because talking about their disability is still pretty taboo. But yeah with every legitimate service there will be people who abuse it but Im pretty confident that most people respect the system. And like another person in this thread said Id much rather not have to deal with a disability on a day to day basis than have the ability to write one of my  midterms  days later.  Also professors are notified of SAS students during the first week of the semester so they have more than enough time to make an extra version. There are always going to be students needing accommodations so its not a surprise to them. They should be taking some fault for your concern.,McMaster,ddkd3h6,12,t5_2r79x

10994376,0,t3_5wy7jd, Your username scares me and i really hope you are actually coming in with an open mind Switching to health sci after first year may be difficult. First year is usually a year of transition so your grades are unpredictable.  I think McMaster has a nice sense of community. People are nice. If you need help people will go out of their way to help you. in my opinion theres not much near McMaster in terms of shopping choices. In terms of groceries I feel like you have to choose between high prices and decent quality or low prices and poor quality. Shopping for other stuff is hard because everything is so far from campus theres no such thing as premed in Canada. However the science career consulting office does have rsum critiques mock interviews etc. They do have info about applying to Canadian med schools if you need it but you can google it all yourself. you rank your room type preferences. Would recommend double as first choice. You want to have a guaranteed friend and want to network with people. Especially since you define yourself as premed youre probably socially awkward and if not forced will not speak to others. A lot of people have the misconception that single or single with washroom is better. A lot of people always complain after getting a single that theyre having trouble meeting people. Also if you have a washroom in your own room youre responsible for all supplies and the cleaning of it. Whereas if you share washrooms they are cleaned every morning by housekeeping staff and you dont have to worry about not having time to clean it or not having time to go out and buy toilet paper or something I started out in life sci majored in molecular bio then switched out to something completely unrelated. I did not like any of the profs. I think the life sciencebiology faculty have the weakest profs in terms of teaching capability. Most suck are unenthusiastic read from their power points monotonously. Overall I feel the life scibio programs just involve repetitive memorization to the point where you just lose all interest in the topics. I was really passionate about biology when I came from high school but after all the courses Ive taken under biolife sci Im just so fucking done. I also feel that the way content was delivered in my courses reading off powerpoints online modules like online lectures but super boring and painful left many gaps in my knowledge. I measure how much I learned in a course by how much I can recall from the course material after having taken the course. You can ask me anything about biology and I probably will not know the answer despite studying it for so long. research opportunities are definitely there which is why networking is important. For example by word of mouth that some profs may be looking for volunteers summer research students etc the program difficulty is somewhat subjective. For example I learn best when I can feel that my profs care when they show enthusiasm when they want you to actually understand a concept rather than just memorizing it because you have to. Since I didnt really get any of this during my time in these various courses I fell behind and completely lost interest in the courses. I still like biology and am fascinated by the many topics but I dont feel that I gained anything significant from actually studying it here.,McMaster,dee6f5k,8,t5_2r79x
