3010690,0,t3_2ucnas,Man dont forget Lou Reeds Street Hassle  I am a Lou Reed fan and maybe  years ago I was listening to this record without any idea Springsteen was on it.  And there in the middle of the title track this huge surprise there it is.Im thinking I cannot be in the same room as this.  Springsteen and Reed together?  I am not cool enough.  I am simply not worthy.If you hate Lou Reed  and if so I will hold a Telethon in your name to save your soul  just skip to about the  minute mark.,BruceSpringsteen,coa215t,1,t5_2ra9d
