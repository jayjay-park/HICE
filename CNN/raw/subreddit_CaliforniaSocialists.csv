11737135,0,t3_62c69u,I have good news on this front. After reviewing the evidence the DA is sitting on the recommended charges for two of the comrades and has yet to file any actual charges against them. The third comrade has had their charges rejected and sent back to the police. The DA may still decide to file charges at some point but as of right now our comrades are in the clear. Theyre also considering a lawsuit against the police who picked up the comrades only after they had been beaten by fascists didnt arrest any of the fascists involved in the attack and sicced a dog on one comrade after he had been placed in handcuffs. ,CaliforniaSocialists,dgqfmyl,2,t5_3hh0j
