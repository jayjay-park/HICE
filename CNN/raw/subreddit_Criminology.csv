1782464,0,t3_2ex56p,gtcan someone who is not related to a family member biologically exhibit psychopathic tendencies if one or more of their adoptive families exhibit them?Absolutely yes.  This is the foundation of many criminological theories.  I would recommend you check out The Nurture Versus Biosocial Debate in Criminology On the Origins of Criminal Behavior and Criminality.  It was compiled by Beaver and Boutwell and features articles on both sides of the debate by many prominent scholars.  It just came out this year.Edit  If you cant get a copy of it let me know if there is a particular article you want and Ill scan it for you  I wrote part of the book and got a bunch of free copies ,Criminology,ck3u0uo,2,t5_2rn1n

3997579,0,t3_367p3r,You could pretty much ask anything.  For example In what ways has alcohol abuse education impacted your drinking? Could you describe your feelings towards alcohol abuse education? Do you think your drinking patterns will change because of education?  If so how?And so on...,Criminology,crbyfsn,2,t5_2rn1n
4336285,0,t3_3amug5,gt Im not sure if there is an agreed upon definition of radicalisation in criminologyyeah theres not. lots of theories but I think a standard model would be problematic because the process has evolved over time. E.g. first young men targeted then women as well and now targeting younger and younger children.lots of overlap with psychologyI think a good way to go about it would be to get more recent articles that have been widely cited e.g.  and also consider how they wrote about such issues before global terrorism media etc.An article that immediately came to mind when I read your post was written by Susan M Anderson and Philip G Zimbardoyes the same Zimbardo from the Stanford Prison experiments. That is why it originally caught my eye as I was curious what else that guy might have been writing about. The article is titled On resisting social influence and get this it was published in the Cultic Studies Journal. Published in  here is a link I just found to it were you thinking about these issues in relation to the recent shooting in Charleston? I dont know how philosophers test hypotheses generally methodologically i mean... gl!,Criminology,csefgeq,3,t5_2rn1n

8945844,0,t1_d7n5pif,gt I dont know the exact numbers and I suspect theyre made up but theres some saying out there that the majority of crimes are committed by the same few people. Like  of criminals are responsible for  of crimes in a given area or something. Dont quote me. gt The crimes seem varied because offenders very rarely specialize and many crimes happen because of opportunity. gt What causes people to break the law is a question whose answer changed based on what theoretical background youre using.  uEatMeImSweet,Criminology,d7n5pok,1,t5_2rn1n
9422605,0,t3_59l1n5,Even though her motive was not mentioned we recently had a discussion about people like her in my psychology lecture. Women like her believe they are doing no wrong. They think that they are the angel of death of sorts they think they are just putting people out of their misery. Regardless as someone who has lost a family member as a result of nursing home negligence what she did was absolutely wrong and she deserves to be locked up whether its in a prison or an insane asylum. ,Criminology,d9adp28,1,t5_2rn1n

10461662,0,t3_5p50vg,This article really makes you think that you are truly being watched and you dont even know it. Granted I knew that law enforcement used facial recognition to find wanted individuals or even missing persons. But did not know that the system is hardly ever scrubbed to remove unneeded photographs of individuals. Now racial profiling has always been a problem within the field of criminal justice and I am not solely placing the blame on the facial recognition system itself. Law enforcement officers using it and the little policy to keep the system under control is to blame. If the system takes photos of everyone all the time then where are peoples privacy come in to play here. This system allows law enforcement to basically track your every movement in a given day which is kind of scary. But at the same time if you do not commit a crime then you really have nothing to fear. I am on the fence about the use of this program. Yes it may help law enforcement catch a good number of offenders but it does bring up the question of when to draw the line. Now the technology probably does help with the apprehension of criminals on a normal basis to justify the use of it and I believe that this system is used more in urban population which would answer why it has so many images of people. But after reading this article I do believe that the system should be regulated somehow to protect the rights of individuals and to make sure that racial profiling is reduced.   ,Criminology,dctxp7k,1,t5_2rn1n
11606002,0,t3_65m0ul,The most cutting edge biological research being done currently in the world of criminology is on epigenetics particularly the marked genetic changes that occur inside of the womb during fetal development. Extremely cutting edge. The biggest concern for researchers and ethics boards is that this has in the past lead to eugenics during the early th century. We must tread lightly in this area. Edit I would like to add that we should not be searching for a genetic causal link to crime. When it comes to biology it is much better to link your variables to aggression which predisposes individuals to violent behaviour. ,Criminology,dgbjtaf,5,t5_2rn1n
