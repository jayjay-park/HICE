Add the extra calories from eating more at lunch and eating breakfast for me anyway is worse for weight loss.

190838,0,t3_1wagjr,gtI suspect that for many people massive amounts of body fat act as an emotional cushionif they can conclude that you hate them because theyre portly theyre spared the pain of thinking you hate them because of their personality.Its an interesting point but I think an attitude like that ultimately does much more harm than good. I get that its comforting to think that if someone dislikes you its for something that you cant control which makes it not your fault. Ive been there. Oh man I bet that guy was only a jerk to me because Im a girlhe likes mesome other bullshit reason.But that kind of thinking is a trap because youre still putting blaming yourself for someone elses actions. If I was quietercutera guya Martian he wouldnt have treated me like that. But some people are just assholes! You really cant control them. You cant control anyone elses actions you can only control your reaction to them. So in my opinion the Fat Advocate types are only creating their own negative feedback loop where someone is a dick to them so they blame their fat and decide to retaliate by...becoming even fatter and louder? I dont know Im sure it makes sense to them. But the only people theyre harming are themselves not their attackers. Seems pretty pointless to me. rantAlso some people are not assholes but will legitimately dislike you based on your personality.

We have a lot of fat people in the area me included but I guess when they revamped the mall they kicked those stores out to get Michael Kors and Sephora in instead. We have an Old Navy but they dont sell fat sizes in the stores just online. I think Macys etc has  plus size departments though... but the clothes are horrendous.Honestly even Lane Bryant... some of the clothes I wondered who the fuck was designing them for fat people. Because there are some hard and fast rules of dressing yourself if youre fat. You have to dress for your body shape no matter what shape you are... and you CAN look like a human being even if youre fat. But Lane Bryant seems to think that horizontal large stripes big florals leggings with patterns and capris look good on size  women. But then again... the women that buy that shit...

However that will probably be the only thing I eat for the next day or so usually. I think part of this is because you dont have a bunch of fat pressing against your stomach so some skinny people can eat a lot. Thats how some of the best competitive eaters are stick thin.I also think that a lot of people think others have the same eating habits and meal schedules as they do. Some people eat  meals a day others eat like  small meals a day. So if youre morbidly obese and you see a skinny person eat a meal bigger than you you might assume that that skinny person also eats three more meals that size every day because thats how you eat.,fatlogic,cf4qi0v,3,t5_2wyxm

Fruits and vegetables other than starchy potatoes become too expensive.  The liver pancreas heart digestive tract all start to suffer making it harder to exercise and to have stamina.  Food stamps used to provide a subsidy for fresh fruits and veggies that was separate and would encourage people to spend money on fresh veg and fruit and in return they would get a few extra  to buy more.  The big farmers nixed this returning families to packaged mass produced plasticized food.  Obviously this isnt to say it isnt also a problem of education exercise and reducing addiction eating.

But healthy meals in general are not.  Nope.  If it were up to me Id eat steak and potatoes every day for the rest of my life and die happy and smiling.  I dont at all consider your grilled salmon in mustard sauce wild rice roasted sweet potatoes and zucchini dinner deprivation or startavtion.  I do find it to be gross though.  But thats just personal preference like anyone and everyone has.  Its just my taste buds that would rather avoid eating as a whole than eat a zuchini or mustard sauce for that matter.  Or... really... most of that other shit you listed.  But I eat a lot of it anyway because I know that I cant eat steak and potatoes every day.  I know that a twinkie a day does not contrary to popular belief keep the doctor away.  And really even after my somewhat ranty comment its not that bad.

458142,0,t1_cfs1kql,gtIf the lady has any concern at all she would change the abused EBT program to be similar to the WIC program. I have worked grocery retail for  years. On EBT time of the month you should see all the JUNK FOOD the people buy with other peoples money. I literally see people pull up to the register with five grocery carts of JUNK FOOD. One to two carts of pop a cart full of frozen pizzas a cart full of frozen TV dinners and pot pies a cart full of potato chips and cereal boxes and bread. Where is the nutrition in all of this? They should make EBT like WIC where you can only purchase produce and healthy foods. If the people do not like that they can get off the abused EBT program. People sell their EBT cards to bodega owners who stock their own stores with merchandise from regular grocery stores which can be a good or bad thing depending on your perspective. The fact that this commenter has been working at a grocery store for more than a decade and hasnt realized that no a  year old man does not plan to eat twenty boxes of Captain Crunch and wash it down with thirty  liter bottles of Pepsi is astonishing.,fatlogic,cfsc901,1,t5_2wyxm

461960,0,t1_cfsqywp,Oh goodness the BRM thing will only get worse too. Im around  at the moment and it suucckkkkssss. The lower you get the more youre going to have to keep an eye on the calories. Paleo seems like a great way to eat but if youre anything like me youll still be able to eat over your calorie needs. Also dont take a little bite of anything unless youre okay with eating the whole thing. Chances are youre going to. Just dont buy big bags of things. Chips chex mix pretzels all of that sort of things. It seems with me once I get the taste of it in my mouth I just eat all of it. If you do buy them try and find the smallest amount of it you can and only buy one. I dont have a ton of experience with dealing with other peoples food around but there are some ways you can sort of trick yourself. Keep the food you eat as separate from everyone elses as you can. A separate cupboard would be ideal. Then if at all possible keep everyone elses in their own cupboard out of sight. If you dont see it and you dont go looking for it you are going to do a much better job of avoiding eating that junk. When yore hungry just go straight to your part and no where else. When youre hungry eat a meal. Period. Dont snack no little bites just the meal. If youre going to eat the meal anyway dont cause yourself the extra calories just have your meal earlier. If you really like snacking I found baby carrots and lettucespinach to be really one at a time snacking alternatives. If you go low fatfat free dressings youll only top out at about  calories and you will have snacked for a very long time which might make your brain feel better about not eating as often. ,fatlogic,cfsrxd3,1,t5_2wyxm

Eat when youre hungry but dont eat if you arent because some number says you should. If youre having a particularly hungry day then eat up to your TDEE. Do what will make you feel good within reason so you can keep doing what youre doing. Thats how you control your weight period.

569097,0,t3_20mlp8,The BMI scale really isnt very useful for people who are already super fit. It just doesnt apply to them in the same way that a sprinter wouldnt be called unhealthy because his body type isnt optimal for longdistance running. What Im trying to point out is that if youre in that minority of people who are muscular enough to be incorrectly labeled overweight or obese by the BMI scale the risk of obesity probably isnt very great for you specifically. Its really really obvious just by looking at the person when the BMI scale doesnt really apply. Heres a simple way to distinguish between these people and everyone else If the average person looks at you and the first descriptive word they think of is fat and not super athletic the BMI scale probably works just fine in your case.A metricmodel is only useful if you understand its limitations and only make use of it in cases when it has obvious value. For example . of fat people.What really rubs me the wrong way about this debate about weight vs health is that the people promoting these weight not correlated with health studies are generally obese sometimes even morbidly obese but the studies themselves are usually talking about people who are overweight at most.EDIT Also this guys BMI is .

620861,0,t1_cgatd9l,Actually the study I found I think it said it was  kids who may have obesity that relates to childhood trauma... it isnt just childhood abuse like from a parent it is also traumas.  So for example a girl who was raped may notice that as she gains weight men stop noticing her.  That could give her security and make her subconsciously sabotage her diets.  Similarly for men childhood bullying could have stopped when a boy grows large enough to have the strength to defend himself.  The idea was originally pioneered by a doctor who was running a successful medical practice I dont remember what and he started an obesity clinic.  When the clinic wasnt successful he tried to figure out why.  He started interviewing patients and asked one questions incorrectly.  Instead of asking something like when was your last sexual encounter he asked for the girls first or something like that and was surprised by the answer.  So he kept talking with her and realized her weight was involved in her recover in really short summary.  And he started asking more people.Anyway the point of the article I read was that we need to help our children not just eat right but grow up in healthy environments that allow them recovery options when a traumatic event does occur.TLDR Really poor summary... I will look up the article... its fascinating.,fatlogic,cgaucco,2,t5_2wyxm

Weightloss programs are scams and dieting is malnurisment. Dont starve yourself to reach societies unhealthy ideals because being anywhere under weight is ugly.Yes I am over exaggerating but most of the die hard fat pros are anyway. ALL body shamming needs to stop. I know EXACTLY how you feel. I have a very small frame I am a healthy weight but I look very thin when I could even loose a few pounds and be fine. I was constantly told to gain weight from people who have clue what my current health is like and its frankly none of their business.I think people are more gentle with people who at over weight because they were treated harsher and were shamed more wide spreadif thats the right way of saying it than thin shaming. Even though the issues are basically the same issue the most common one is treated first and with the mot thought even though its been blown out of proportion. Its treated similar to sexism against menaka people claiming its non existent.  Its stupid I,fatlogic,cgbx4k0,2,t5_2wyxm

They had significantly less sugar in their diet and  years earlier virtually none for the average person. Here is what Brillat Saverin said in Physiology of Taste regarding how one loses weight and stops gaining weight he wrote this in gt Oh Heavens! all you readers of both sexes will cry out oh Heavens above. But what a wretch the Professor is! Here in a single word he forbids us everything we must love those little white rolls from Limet and Achards cakes and those cookies and a hundred things made with flour and butter with flour and sugar with flour and sugar and eggs!gt gt He doesnt even leave us potatoes or macaroni! Who would have thought this of a lover of good food who seemed so pleasant?gt gt Whats this I hear? I exclaim putting on my severest face which I do perhaps once a year. Very well then eat! Get fat! Become ugly and thick and asthmatic finally die in your own melted grease.Pretty much paleoprimal right?gt In  John Rollo reported on the results of treating two diabetic Army officers with a lowcarbohydrate diet and medications. A very lowcarbohydrate ketogenic diet was the standard treatment for diabetes throughout the th century. sourceThe source above also states that neanderthals were probably almost exclusively carnivores.  Modern hunter gatherer societies also live on a very low carbohydrate diet. It looks to me like the food pyramid the modern American diet is the fad.,fatlogic,cgwdgpa,6,t5_2wyxm

Is it that their bodies actually ramped up metabolism in response to the increase in food i.e. they burned more sitting around than they normally would or that they werent able to digest all of the food since they were being overfed i.e. they werent absorbing everything that they were eating. Or maybe some of them fidgeted more or were able to be slightly more active even though they limited physical activity as much as possible in response to the increase in food and so actually did burn more than others.,fatlogic,ch54av6,3,t5_2wyxm

1023167,0,t3_25t79b,This article sums up the thinking of a lot of fat activists and while its infuriatingly misguided it also makes me quite sad.Most magazines have terrible nutrition and exercise advice. Fad diets that promise you the world sell copies researchbacked nutritional advice that talks about achieving weight loss goals in months or years doesnt.  Unfortunately this is many peoples only source of information about diet and exercise.  So they try the bullshit fad diet and the unsustainable exercise regimen but cant keep it up so they go back to their old habits and put on whatever weight they lost.This is only made worse by seeing thin people around them or fit people at the gym.  Why cant I look like them? How are they doing it?  They must either be torturing themselves the same way I tried to or they must be genetically gifted.  Theres no other explanation.So in their mind their only options are starvation and torture or giving up and accepting who you are.Unfortunately this is the reality of many peoples knowledge about nutrition and exercise and it is a prime breeding ground for fat logic.,fatlogic,chkl9rw,37,t5_2wyxm

I assume health takes conscious effort somewhere effort is too subjective to generalize and really I think natural absolves someone of personal responsibility. If I expend as much effort to be healthy as is necessary who are you or anyone else to say how much of that was effort for me and how much I was naturally inclined to do?

Weight loss is therefore considered the first line treatment in overweight women with PCOS. gtgt Normalization of the menstrual cycles and ovulation could occur with modest weight loss as little as  of the initial weight.Weight loss can improve not only circulating androgen and glucose levels but also ovulation and pregnancy rates in obese women with PCOS however weight loss is only recommended for those who are overweight with a BMI gt  kgm. gtgt PCOS affects quality of life and can worsen anxiety and depression either due to the features of PCOS or due to the diagnosis of a chronic disease. A healthy lifestyle consists of a healthy diet regular exercise and achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. This review identified six studies with  participants that assessed the effects of a healthy lifestyle in women with PCOS. In this review while some studies reported on fertility menstrual regularity and ovulation the findings were reported in a variety of ways and it was not possible to estimate the overall effects of lifestyle on these outcomes. Current evidence suggests that following a healthy lifestyle reduces body weight and abdominal fat reduces testosterone and improves both hair growth and improves insulin resistance.gtgt Compared with women who consumed the conventional healthy diet more women who consumed the lowGI diet low glycemic index diet showed improved menstrual cyclicity  compared with  respectively P  ..gtgt Changes in diet and lifestyle remain the primary choice of management of reproductive and metabolic sequelae in overweight and obese women with PCOS.,fatlogic,ci0wss9,23,t5_2wyxm

As fat as I am I could probably lose  lbs or more in a year but it would be keeping up that level of dedicationmotivation beyond that year that would concern me.Id like to get out of the cheating mentality... there are certain things I would like to allow myself to enjoy every few months a certain restaurant meal etc. Things that are true pleasures not just random I deserve a Frosty bc I worked hard. Kind of like the  rule except maybe scaled up to a  rule. If I am going to live this way for the rest of my life it has to be sustainable. I cant say I will NEVER eat chips at a Mexican restaurant again. But if I do that maybe  times per year instead of  times per week ask me about my Mexican food struggz then I can look forward to it and savor it but not obsess over it because Ive denied myself for  years. Does that make sense?As I said in the post Im getting professional help this time. It makes me feel a little pathetic but I really want to be successful. I want to feel better.

This included BMI number of pushups situps etc. They had a set grade for each level too and the only way to get an A in the BMI department was to have a BMI of around . Ive lost a lot of weight since high school... about  pounds but at the time I was measured to have around  BMI according to the rickety little scale they put us on. Of course this caused an outrage because it was punishing kids for not losing  bodyfat in a period of  months and so the grading was changed to grade on improvement instead of a flat grade. Either way I definitely think the focus of physical education in high school should be more on just getting the kids to move and teaching them how to improve their health as opposed to grading them on it.

And again until you figure out how to do it right. Dont make up bullshit excuses and quit on yourself. The only person youre cheating is you.  Im dead tired of the fat logic I grew up with that has kept me from losing weight.Every woman in my family has an unhealthy relationship with food. Growing up with that gave me a really warped perception of reality.My aunts are overweight and yoyofad dieters. Theyre always bombarding me with  bizarre diets like the cookie diet the cabbage diet the hoodia diet the low fat diet etc. As long Ive Ive known them theyve never managed to maintain any weight loss success theyve had. Then there was always some excuse as to why they couldnt stay thin Im so stressed busy depressed broke etc..My mom was the opposite. Shes had a metabolism issue her entire life that has kept her freakishly thin no matter how much she ate my grandparents were reported to CPS multiple times because people though they were starving my mother.She ate an awful diet and fed me the same food. Then she was so surprised when I started getting fat at  years old. So she started feeding me faux health food low fat chips salads with cheesebaconranch sugary tea instead of soda and became even more frustrated when I wasnt losing weight. She started making me work out which in itself wasnt bad but she always made me feel like I was doing something wrong. As a result health food and exercise felt like a punishment. I remember being  years old and hiding candy bars in my room and despising exercise. I didnt have healthy relationship with food and exercise until I was in college. Now I love working out and eating right.Im just tired of the BS. Calories in calories out. Overestimate calorie intake underestimate exercise. Its gonna be hard and its gonna suck. It takes a lot of work and its not gonna be easy. Fat logic doesnt understand any of that. This is what it comes down to Do you wanna succeed or make excuses?

I dont have a magical energy engine inside me that can keep all of my internal organs running without expending calories. Whenever someone is a certain weight at a certain height at a certain age it means that they must be consuming on average the base metabolic rate for that height weight and age of calories per day or they wouldnt have become that weight. My inherent disgust toward people who are  pounds lets assume someone  tall  years old is rooted in the fact that in order to maintain that weight theyd have to be eating  calories per day. Thats a fucking obscene amount of food. To put it in perspective we can break it down into fat sugar and protein calories of fat is . pounds. Pounds of FAT. Animal fat to be precise. calories of powdered sugar is . pounds.I regret that I couldnt find anything quite as close to pure protein although the closest I could get was boneless skinless white meat chicken breast specifically prepared in the method of stewing for the lowest fatprotein ratio. That being the case calories of this would mean eating  and  pounds of it.These are just examples but its purely to illustrate how INCREDIBLY MUCH food it takes to stay fat.

1509072,0,t3_2bg03c,FA comes out of a society which is now so paralyzed by political correctness people would rather allow a dangerous lie to circulate than challenge it in public. Its also a symptom of the internet age  and you could argue its a very similar trend to what is happening in politics in the US. People simply look for information which supports their viewpoint rather than deal with facts that might oppose their beliefs. Rather than consider they are wrong they dig even deeper into their delusions. So when a doctor tells someone that being obese is effecting their health they go into denial. Thinking about all the effort and hardship it will take to lose weight. They want a pill or an easy fix to their beetus  or gout. But most doctors will stay away from pills because every medication has sideeffects. If there is a natural way to treat something say losing lbs its a far cry better for your wallet and your organs. Most doctors will tell you no matter how many pills they give to treat the symptoms or effects of obesity related diseases. The only cure is to not be obese. The FA movement tries claiming that isnt true. It must be something else! The  other doctors who told you the same thing are lying to you? At this point I would say let them die. But they wont die with any dignity. They will just continue to demand medical care for their selfinflicted diseases and expect me to pay.  There are also psychological consequences to being obese. These people have anger jealousy and desire to be attractive. But because they lack the willpower to say no to hoho. As a result they are trying to change societies idea of beauty to fit their warped sensibilities. I can see how they believe this will work. When you see yourself as an oppressed minority you need to make society aware. They took a page from the GLBT playbook. They are trying to normalize being fat. The same way being gay has been normalized. But they arent the same thing. Sexual preferences are not something we can control any more than what skin color we happen to be born with. Being fat on the other hand is something we have total control over. One of the few things we can control in this world is what we put into our bodies. So when someone says I cant lose weight or its impossible they are claiming that fat is an immutable trait genetics. Again not true. Its a matter of calories inout. Most FAs we assume dont count calories or have any real understanding of the bodys metabolic systems.  mins of walking isnt going to negate an entire large pizza but eating a kcal diet will lead to weight loss. They just cant accept it because that means they need to deny themselves and admit there is something wrong with their lifestyles. The sad thing is if it were  years ago they might have accepted the truth that because it was common accepted knowledge that being too fat  bad for your health. Back then most people would have gone oh well I guess I need to try to lose some weight. Additionally  years ago we didnt have the obesity problem we have now. We can argue up and down why that is.

In theory HAES could have been awesome if it actually worked to inspire people to work out eat properly or you know be healthy no matter your size. Weight loss would just more likely inevitably follow. Instead its this horse shit that tells impressionable uneducated minds they are being attacked if anyone comments on the health implications of their weight so they are literally setting these people up to not even be actually helped. Then they are saying crap like eating unhealthy is fine being diabetic is fine. Its not fine. And the fact that people like regan chastain are apparently trying to charge people for HAES seminars and other bullshit pisses me off because they are preying on people like my sisters clients or who i work with when i do my volunteer hours. People who cant afford to waste money like that but theyre just so desperate for someone to tell them their life is okay theyll probably do it.  ,fatlogic,cj7aqhq,11,t5_2wyxm

I think one thing we as fatlogicfighters can do when we encounter reallive instances like this is  of course educate them on the facts which is actually empowering it puts the control along with the responsibility in the hands of the person something that young people do not have a long history of yet  stress to the person that they must separate the issues and deal with each...if one really is suicidal then seek out help for that.  Do NOT wait around to get to the size you want to.  In fact dealing with anxiety and depression will likely help you get things into perspective help you see things in a more rational light.   Adolescents are different they just are.  We cant assume that they have had good habits modeled for them or that they have healthy alternatives at home.  tldr Along with stamping out misinformation we should try to always address other health and life issues such as teenage depression  suicidal feelings.,fatlogic,cj880mu,3,t5_2wyxm

I expected spiritual grandeur a feeling of being part of the universe feeling the strands of existence harmonize with the uplifted voices of Gods creatures. Instead I became an alter server and saw the bulk shipment of communion wafers from China the alternately peeling or clothesstaining varnish on the rickety pews the GROWN ASS ADULTS wearing flip flops and clipping coupons during the readings. Then the sermons. By the time the sermon came around Id be grinding my teeth to dust. Some fat old balding fuck talking a big game but at the end of the day its just a job for him. Fuck up your life? Just repeat this meaningless chant ten times and feel bad about it and youre cool. No sir when you fuck up you need to really viscerally feel remorse and no amount of bead counting should alleviate it. You should wake up in a cold sweat decades later you should live always remembering the pain you caused the universe in your fragile imperfect humanity and strive to correct the balance every moment of the rest of your existence.

So I made a goal to lose  lbs in  weeks the start of holidays.  I cut out the sugary snacks and ditched the starchy side dishes.  Really focused on fresh fruit and vegetables.

As band size increases the cup letter represents more volume than an equivalent cup size with a smaller band.  As far as breast volume a DDC.So with that in mind objectively huge tetons usually do come on bigger bodies though due to continental drift and general sag they might not retain a normal breast shape. There are plenty of fat women with tiny or medium titties and there are plenty of thin women with large titties for their bodies but when it comes down to it not many thin bodies are going to pack  watermelons worth of fat into the breast area while totally neglecting the rest.

There is a genetic component.  I think it is largely mental  some people are more attune to what their bodies need than others.  Some peoples bodies may be more predisposed to store fat.  Some people have to work at staying healthy and some people do it effortlessly.The people who can eat whatever they want actually do eat whatever they want.  They arent consuming  calories and tunneling them into another dimension.  They just have a balance where what they want turns out to be what their body needs.  Most people have to work to balance those two things.Going back to the basketball analogy.  Some people can slam dunk without any training.  Some people have to work to be able to do it.

If youre fat or have something in your body that is malfunctioning eating until youre full will either never happen or itll happen only after a significant amount of food that is much higher for a fat person than a thinner person.Thats partially what intuitive eating is about for anyone who actually understands it rather than takes it as meaning eating x the amount you ate last week will speed your metabolism up and cause weight loss.

They want to seem supportive and they want to seem positive and they know that these illusions will be shattered if they honestly say what they truly mean Stop. Stop doing it stop talking about it. Stop even letting people know that what youre doing is possible. Fail with the rest of us and proclaim that success is impossible.So in order to seem like good people while criticizing someone for improving his life and harming no one they manipulate the language of the discourse. See Wil what we know better than you is that youre really just trying to be healthier. We want you to be healthier too.Healthier is a preferable term for people who are opposed to true selfimprovement because anyone can lie to themselves and the rest of the world by claiming to be healthy. They can point to a single statistic  say resting blood pressure or cholesterol levels  and use it to buttress the healthy argument. Hence the profusion of obese people risking their lives while loudly announcing that their lifestyles are healthy.But Wils goals arent vague and coy and euphemistic. He specifically states that it is the fat on his body that is threatening his health  and that losing fat is therefore central to what he needs to do. He wants to eliminate fat from his body and stop being a fat piece of crap which is his expression of anger at himself for having become gluttonous and unhealthy and selfish and unattractive. ,fatlogic,cke9qj2,1,t5_2wyxm

It seems to me that by this definition cigarettes fall in the same category as food.  Anyway I dont see much point in drawing your distinction.

1910156,0,t1_ckj79nf,And youll end up underweight really fast if you legitimately are refusing to eat food for any reason. An obese person may have a TDEE of close to  kcal. This means if theyre not eating anything or eating only tiny amounts of food they might be running at a defict of  kcal per day.Note that theyre still eating  kcal a day in this example.At this rate theyd be losing  pounds of fat per week.  pounds of fat per month.In a year?  pounds of fat lost.So if someone is obese and refusing to eat food for any reason theyre not going to be obese for very long.If theyre still obese and not losing weigh then they are eating food. They might have disordered eating habits but at the end of the day theyre managing to eat food.Starvation is far more dangerous than obesity. Both will kill you in the end but starvation gets you there a whole lot faster. Obesity can take decades to kill.

1962564,0,t1_ckpjt0z,Agreed. The emphasis should be on how shes promoting herself as a skilled researcher in the absence of evidence. I think most of us could put together a blog devoted to showing how flawed HAES is and could do much better research to support our points than she does it is a lot easier for us when the evidence is so abundant that obesity is unhealthy as fulltime bloggers even though most of us dont have a degree in a medical or scientific field.Of course its still fair to show her hypocrisy when she brags about how shes a trained researcher because she is using her schooling as an argument to listen to her while discounting the weight of the credentials that doctors have. Ive been in and out of college for six years without a degree but I dont brag about my level of education. Logic and facts are what count and sometimes I have the better ones and sometimes its someone else with more or less or equivalent education to me. I would not call myself an expert in anything other than my subjective experiences because for that you do need credentials if not a degree then a major accomplishment research project or similar depending on the subject.,fatlogic,ckpovij,2,t5_2wyxm

Also men tend to build muscle differently and more quickly I believe? than women.  So what Im saying is that theyre comparing apples to oranges.  If youre a woman what is healthy for Dwayne Johnson probably isnt healthy for you in terms of body composition.

To also be fair BMI does oversimplify things but that doesnt mean its an any worse indication that once you gain a certainish amount of weight at your height you begin to put yourself at increased risk for disease. As for the but muscles! argument no doctor worth their salt would ever look at a muscular person and say well this table says youre obese. its just a way for fat people to say well under this fat I have some muscle!

Choose foods that give you a bigger nutritional bang for your buck rather than processed junk with a lower caloric tally. Those emptycalorie foods are simple carbs that are processed quickly and dont support optimal cell function says Morrison who recommends focusing the bulk of your diet on nutrientrich vegetables lean proteins and healthy fats. Try sulforaphanerich Brussels sprouts broccoli and cabbage chicken turkey and fish and nuts and monounsaturated olive oil. Supplement that fare with complex carbs that digest slowly and help keep your metabolism revved  like quinoa sweet potatoes and Irish oats.I dont think thats fat logic.

Sure there are things you can do to improve muscle sparing action and maintain the majority of it but when you are cutting you will lose fat AND muscle the goal is to just make most of it fat while minimizing how much muscle you lose.The method should be use BMI to determine healthy weight range determine desired BF then calculate what percentage should be lean mass and what percentage should be fat then just cut until you get there.

2216159,0,t1_cllgy6w,Airlines in the US are sort of trying this  they have different names off the top of my head AAs is Main Cabin Extra and Deltas is Economy Comfort. The problem with this though  and why wide economy seats arent anywhere near catching on  is that they need to have people pay the extra money to sit in them to have them be worthwhile. If they dont sell and they have to put people that paid for a normal seat in them the airline loses money. If you have many different products on an airplane you have to sell suchandsuch  of FC tickets Business tickets Econ tickets and regular economy tickets and really at different prices. And that is very hard.Lets try this analogy lets say Im a GM dealer. Every day I have  Caddys to sell along with  Buicks and  Chevys. I cant sell the cars on any other day and I get a new stock of vehicles every morning. At some point during the day Ill basically take a loss on a Cadillac  theres no use in sending that car back at the end of the day. Other days the cool new tech startup at the end of the street IPOs and I could sell  of the nicer cars and basically end up turning away business. If you think the easiest way to solve this problem is to make the offerings simpler say put a few features on all the Chevys hope that captures the Buick market and up the base price a tad congratulations you just made the same decision as most airlines.So this is the basic problem that airlines have  seats go bad they need to sell them before the airplane takes off  and they have a different group of customers with a different mix of incomes and disposable money to fly every day. They configure their planes based on some guesses about what they think they can sell but getting more and more specific just runs the risk of pricing someone out andor not offering something that someone else will want forcing them to turn away business. However if a seat is going to cost more for example take up the floor space of . economy seats it needs to generate a proportionate amount more income or at least .x the average coach ticket on that flight  to break even. If it flies empty or  worse  with someone who only paid for a normal coach ticket  the airline loses money.Anyway that got longwinded but Making money in air travel is hard. Different sized seats will make it harder. Jet engines dont care about your feels.,fatlogic,cllizaw,20,t5_2wyxm

2250614,0,t3_2kyst3,FatFitStarted around  lb  months ago. I was pretty deep in depression and alcoholism binge eating a lot rarely left the house. I refuse to kill myself because I witnessed my exboyfriend attempt so periodically I get to a point where my choices in my mind are to off myself or go to the psych ward. I wont do the former so I did the latter. Upon release I saw they had written obese on my chart and I decided it was time to make a change. Figured it would help me feel better about myself to lose the weight. Calorie counting weight lifting and cardio all implemented and I lost weight pretty easily.When I got to about  pounds it was Thanksgiving and the feast made me remember how much I missed binge eating. Quick feel good mechanism. So I binged but I panicked after pulled over to a gas station on my way home and purged. I was good at it right off the bat. So from November  to February  I binged and purged a lot. It quickly became habitual I lost a little more weight but gained it back as my binges got bigger and bigger. My performance at the gym suffered. The more I did it the more I hated my body the more obsessed with my weight and calories I got. It completely destabilised my mental health and I relapsed with alcohol. Again the impossible choice of offing myself or going back to nuthouse. Went back to the nuthouse.I was incredibly motivated to get better and I did. I still have body dysmorphia and eating disordered tendencies but I have only binged and purged once since getting treatment have been sober for  months and have only had a couple of small lapses with restriction. My weight crept downward slowly as I went through treatment which was fine as I was not underweight. I took up bodybuilding seriously during treatment because it helped me cope with the dysmorphia. Im now pretty muscular and I was stable at  lb for a while.At this point in time my weight . is lower than my treatment team likes  due to a recent series of events that led me to believe I was eating too much. I lowered my calories from  to  and lost weight. Im now at  attempting to put a bit of weight back on. Here are some details about my diet and lifestyle then vs nowWhen I was obese I typically ate very little during the day quantitywise because my status as an alcoholic killed my appetite. I would drink a lot of coffee with sugary creamer maybe grab a couple things off the dollar menu for lunch. In the late afternoonevening I got blasted drunk usually drinking a pack of beer or a box of wine a day. Then when I was sufficiently drunk I would order food delivered to my house or make drunken baked goodies. I wouldnt be surprised if I was consuming well over  calories a day. No exercise at all I drove everywhere.Now I eat a lot more quantity wise but a lot less calories. No alcohol and I eat out once a week. I count calories and weigh all of my food which is a habit that they typically discourage in ED treatment but I found that without keeping track I was more prone to impulsive overundereating. So my team and I have agreed that counting and weighing is okay as long as I am getting an appropriate amount of calories. I exercise daily lift weights on a schedule of legspushlegspulloffrepeat. My weight lifting routine is intense and starts with complex lifts for few reps and works down to isolated lifts for many reps. Ive seen great improvements in total strength and hypertrophy doing this. I moved to an area where I do not need a car and do all of my errands and transportation on foot. I use public transportation once or twice a week when I am going somewhere more than a few miles away andor the weather is shit. I do  minutes of cardio per day and do some gentle yoga in the evenings. I am vehemently antifatlogic especially when it intersects with eating disorders. A lot of FAs adopt the language and sentiments of ED recovery to justify their bad habits to themselves and each other which I find disgusting. A lot of them contribute to the misconception that anorexia is the most elite and legitimate eating disorder by refusing to acknowledge that their diagnosis iswould be EDNOS. They are openly envious of eating disordered women claiming that they have privilege which glorifies eating disorders and makes other young women want to have them. They promote the idea that the only choices in life for people with eating disorders are death by starvation or morbid obesity which is a lie that our eating disorders tell us anyway. It makes other people afraid of recovery. They refuse to acknowledge that their binge eating is just as disordered as selfstarvation and purging. So there we go.

2254868,0,t1_clq8awv,I agree. Fatness is a psychological issue at its core and even though its technically as simple as just eating less thats hard. And sometimes eating less doesnt even do it. Some Starbucks drinks have similar amounts of Calories to a Big Mac and the Big Mac is much more filling. Theres so much misinformation fad diets diet plans all sorts of shit its easy for somebody to get the impression that diets dont work or that in order for them to work you have to give up all the foods you love or buy special food to eat. Its common knowledge that eating fatty foods makes you fat right? However fat in itself is not bad for you and fat can in some cases be more filling than sugars. I do not know what its like to be a REALLY fat person even though I used to be chubby. I also dont know what its like to be a fat woman because women are the targets of most of the misinformation out there. If you were a fat woman who has never known being thin because your parents didnt care enough to limit what you ate I can see why you would be skeptical of a thin person saying all you had to do was eat less when youve been told by everyone else that you have to do some occult ritual to lose wieght and the big heh one  you dont think you eat that much in the first place. If someone has never eaten a normal amount of food to them normal is a lot more than it is for others. Another thing Ive noticed is that fat people are constantly munching on something. They may eat very little at their meals but you can bet your ass theyre eating a candy bar at their desk and eating chips in the afternoon. So someone can actually eat very little and very healthy at their meals but ruin it because they eat and dont even think about the fact that theyre eating. ,fatlogic,clqf9i3,14,t5_2wyxm

I would be very surprised if it werent a hoax.EDIT Heres a letter the original is very long read it here from someone who knew her in collegegt She went to Simons Rock in  and was the youngest ever accepted at that time. ... She was normal as I said. I have the yearbook. She did okay in classes but she did use an exceptional amount of drugs and when she went home for winter break her brother Jeremy commented that she seemed really messed up dirty odd etc. About this time she changed her name from Amanda to Nightsong which was her elf name. Later it would include the Galglinda Dulin bit although for awhile she insisted Nightsong and Galglinda were separate personalities along with several others.gt...gtThen they brought in a neurologist. Soon after with a little suggestion Amanda started having Seizures. Im a diagnosed epileptic from childhood. Those were some fakeass seizures. When you seize you fall over suddenly. You dont slump slowly and gracefully to the ground avoiding hurting yourself.gt...gtAmanda had decided sans eye exam that she was having eye trouble. Mom went right along. Did mom take her to Lenscrafters? Nope. They just stocked up on glasses from the drugstore. Then the Irlen lenses started  And the sensory sensitivity. Amanda amp her mom spent thousands on crap like special sunglasses brushes special incense etc etc etc. They figured all of her crazy was just that Amanda was too sensitive.  gtAmanda started going to a special ed program as a schizophrenic. Six months in she became a peer buddy to an autistic girl. Thats when the whole fascination with autism started. Amanda would comment that the autistic kids were the only kids who didnt make fun of her which may well be true. So then she started hanging around with them going to their conferences learning about autism etc. She knew my exboyfriend who I later married had an autistic sister Sara.

On top of that part of all these hospitals would have to be renovated to be able to house a gigantic MRI.

The organic gluten free dairy free non GMO peanut tree nut fat cholesterol and sodium free chocolate syrup in my fridge is  cal per  table spoons.

They put this tiny baby on your chest and from day one heshe is the most perfect human being youve ever seen. It just makes evolutionary sense that we especially moms should fall head over heals in love with our own offspring. Their survival depends on it. It really is like being in a trance. I remember thinking she was so beautiful that I felt guilty taking her places because I didnt want other moms to feel bad about their own kids.But shes four now and the trance is wearing off as it should now that her immediate survival no longer depends on my being so invested in her. I am able to see her faults and her imperfections more clearly and I feel like its my job to help her grow into the best person she can possibly be. Her dad was fat as a kid and Im determined not to let that be her fate for health reasons as well as that kids can be cruel and I dont want her to have to feel bad about herself. I was never overweight as a child and I had selfesteem issues anyway. I cant imagine how much worse it would have been if Id been fat. I have almost  control over her eating habits right now and Id consider myself a lousy parent if I didnt set her on the right course. I have a family member whos daughter probably weighed more at  years old than I ever have in my life. The kid is a beach ball with arms and legs. This is child abuse! Kids are so adaptable it takes almost nothing for them to change their habits if given the proper encouragement and expectations.

2522735,0,t1_cmnuq43,I broadly agree with what youre saying with one significant quibble  some people really like the things theyre addicted to. How do we know that? Well a couple ways  one is that you can just ask them. Not all smokers say they wish they could quit many openly say that they really really like smoking. Likewise a decent number of obese people say they enjoy overeating so much that theyre not willing to change. I dont think thats a good choice but some people do explicitly make that choice. The other is the theory of revealed preference.Yeah people get addicted to things but that doesnt mean theyre not also making a choice. Im very very addicted to caffeine  I consume a full pot of coffee every morning. Thats a lot of caffeine! Its also an explicit decision that Ive thought through and decided that I like the effects of caffeine and enjoy drinking coffee.Basically addicts still have agency is my point there.The other thing thats worth noting is lots of people consume McDonalds and other fast food in moderation and have no problem doing so.

Its like telling airlines to install bigger seats and carry less passengers and lose money. They are telling someone else their business. That is the most dangerous arrogance of Ragen she is telling medical professionals how to do their job. She is an uneducated ignoramus. Just because I happen to know a fair amount about medicine as a layman it doesnt mean I get to sell cards to people telling them how to argue with trained professionals. And the hypocrisy! She talks about being a professional and a trained researcher and expects everyone to revere and respect her as a final authority on everything she says but the actual trained and certified medical doctors need to be educated by the likes of her?!?Puhleeze!And I am sceptical of doctors. I have an elderly mother and my father is dead. I have gone through all of the idiocy that comes with their mistakes and carelessness. Doctors arent perfect and they do make mistakes. But Im pretty sure they all understand basic nutritional facts and how obesity negatively affects other problems. From a scientific approach a trained researcher should know that a doctor is going to ration their time and care by eliminating the obvious. Not everyone has PNL LKS or Devics. To get to that oneinamillion diagnosis you have to eliminate the things with the largest odds as thats usually what it is.

Back then some schools didnt even had afternoon lessons. We were also told that it was ok to ask her about her illness and how she felt but not to push for answers and of course no to say mean things about her appearance not even as a silly joke. We also had her familys and her therapists contact numbers. Looking back I realized no one told us to tell her how beautiful she was all the time as some FA activists seem to be asking from the world.Anyway the class took the task seriously and that allowed her to have a somewhat controlled environment outside the clinic.Im not sure if that would work well today.  years ago we were very candid about certain things and bullying Nelson Muntz style was something that just happened in american movies.

Breakfast has to fill me up until lunch hello oatmeal lunch has to get me through the afternoon without putting me to sleep or making me anxious dinner has to be satisfying but small so I can relax and sleep well snacks have to fit into the calorie budget. It  takes selfknowledge and forethought that I never had before because I could just eat something else if the first thing didnt do it. Having the freedom to eat whatever I wanted within the calorie budget instead of trying to stick to some rigid macro or nutritional scheme imposed from the outside is giving me the freedom to finally figure out how to eat correctly for me.

And youll still look good in clothes!!! That being said make sure youre doing resistance training and not just cardio while youre losing weight. Its gonna help maintain the massive amount of muscle obese peoples bodies create to help support the extra fat. Its honestly a pretty great advantage when it comes to looking at underweight people gaining weight versus overweight people losing weight. Muscle takes work and time to build but youve built it without really trying.

2680096,0,t1_cn7redw,I will note this.  I recently got to helping someone who is morbidly obese do couch to k.  They were not physically able to complete the program.  I made sure of it. IE I pushed them myself.  It was eye opening on just how physically disabling obesity can be.  We chose something that was intended to help anyone of any physical level able to run for a person who had successfully completed it a year and a half before they regained lbs and wanted to try again to lose the weight.This speed is actually rather impressive for the bulk that Ragen carries around.  The sad part is that this is rather impressive for someone who is so morbidly obese.I have done these training programs with Morbidly obese BMI  BMI  and a BMI  ish and a BMI  or so eyeballing as I dont know her weight.BMI  and below all were able to run continuously without breaks during their k this was all done at same time.  The BMI  and  ladies were able to run nearly  miles non stop on the first run we did at a  minute pace.The BMI  worked up to running continuously by going out  times a week based on the program and ran continuously the entire time.BMI  simply could not despite effort and despite posting validation of the attempts on some Ck app all women were using.It made me sad but we do have point out that even FINISHING that much distance was probably a pretty solid achievement in itself and is quite good for someone so physically handicapped.  Unfortunately the someone in this case doesnt realize that what they are doing is chosen physical handicapping and is causing them self harm and their ideas cause self harm to others.  No one should live their life with that little mobility if they arenthavent been seriously injured.EDIT The above was just completed for a k run in December I had the  obese women train with me by going to a local track with a  lap per mile track the other women I ran with a few times but they self trained themselves.  Everyone got a PR for the distance regardless of the size I am a male but all women involved were trying to do a self improvement ladies run kind of group thing and I helped out.,fatlogic,cn8eqsl,2,t5_2wyxm

Similar to AA or NA they have people they make friends with who expect to see them at meetings who can help keep them accountable and share their success. Im not a fan of people in general especially groups so I would hate that but I have more extroverted friends for whom I think thats a helpful aspect. Having a room full of people who are kinda expecting that youll be losing weight but are supportive I imagine creates some positive pressure to succeed. Also from what I understand once someone reaches their goal it becomes free as long as they stay within  lbs. Which makes sense keep those people around to both motivate others and so they are still in an environment that encourages them to maintain instead of returning to old habits if they actually continue to show up.,fatlogic,cnojqnz,3,t5_2wyxm

However it seems to me that what they the tumblrites want is for everyone to reward mediocrity. Its great if you want to make model trains or knit hats or whatever instead of focusing all of your attention on becoming an elite level athlete.  Most people wont be elite level. Most people are going to only have age group titles to look forward to. But if you are going to try to get recognition for your art projects you have to be good. Not hobby knitter good actually talented at whatever. Its that way with anything. If you want recognition and you dont have some sort of insurmountable odds to overcome you have to be better than other people at whatever it is you do. And dedication and disciple.

3026386,0,t1_cob5gkr,Fruit is great. Theres a site sugarscience.org that has doctors from the UCSF school of medicine giving facts and warnings about sugar. This is as legit and nonbiased a site one is ever going to get.An apple can contain  grams of sugar. How can I eat a balanced diet and limit sugar to  grams?The sugar limits that we use on SugarScience only apply to added sugar  sugar that is added to food during processing either in a factory in the kitchen or at the table. Naturallyoccurring sugars in fruits and vegetables are not included in these tallies for three reasons. First studies show that eating fruit and vegetables is protective of heart disease the  cause of death worldwide while the evidence shows that sugary drinks and foods put us at greater risk for heart disease. Second when sugar occurs in nature it normally comes packaged with fiber which slows down our bodys absorption of the sugars and reduces its impact on the pancreas and livervital organs that can be affected by sugar overload. By contrast added sugar is most commonly found in foods with low fiber or no fiber at all such as beverages. Third fruits and vegetables carry with them vital nutrients that are beneficial to health.

3037687,0,t1_coctznb,Okay so you are really new to climbing and it is showing. First off welcome to the sport it is a lot of fun. Youre right i guess bouldering does start with VV however at the gyms i have been to they start at lower letters. Such as A etc. Just because you have the option to be held up on a route while top roping does not mean it is easier. There is a reason the term red point came around. for people that dont want a break and to truly test their skillenduranceSo the difference between bouldering and top roping bouldering is good for technique and top roping is good for endurance. Neither are harder than the other. If you have a hard time with endurance try to red point routes. If you need to perfect technique go for a bouldering route. But dont say one is harder than the other because you will get strong arguments from both sides from actual climbers.

All I said is that if you want to design a successful diet ie one that is adhered to you have to take into account any existing issues that modify both sides of the calories incalories out equation. If you cant understand this simple fact I hope youre not designing diets for people. Im sure you think its impressive that you read the wikipedia article on diabetes and can parrot mechanisms of the disease but its really not nor is it relevant when saying its something that should be factored in when attempting weight loss. Additionally the fact that you dont understand that older studies when still being cited are thus still relevant tells me that youre beyond reasoning. Continue reading what you want into what I wrote rather than anything I actually said.By the way my field is much younger and faster moving than diabetes research and we still cite articles from the s.

3071616,0,t1_coftbn0,Yes but muscle is a very good shock absorber too even more so than fat and excess fat raises estrogen levels which leads to difficulty in building more muscle. So they basically have a subpar shock absorber that inhibits then from building more of an even better shock absorber. The appropriate amount of visceral fat acts as a cushion for your organs but excess visceral fat is harmful and probably doesnt confer much of an additional benefit in terms of cushioning abdominal organs. Subcutaneous fat is meant to act more as an insulator than as a cushion and too much insulation makes it more difficult for athletes to regulate body temperature. Excess fat also raises inflammatory markers which means that when they get injured they wont be able to heal as well as someone with appropriate levels of body fat. Also fat adds useless mass and the larger your mass the more force that has to be put into stopping you which means when they have excess body fat on top of muscle the hits have to be harder. If they lost the excess fat even without building anymore muscle than they have now the hits wouldnt need to be as hard as they are so injury would be less likely. If they worked to gain more muscle while losing the fat they would be left with more of a better shock absorber so even if the hits remained as hard as they are now they would end up lees likely to be injured than they are now. Plus they would be healthier and have better glucose regulation which is super important for athletes. The issue is that it takes a lot of work to gain muscle without putting on fat its incredibly time consuming and you really have to eat clean and few people have that discipline. ,fatlogic,cogdbwo,1,t5_2wyxm

Because despite her trying to convince everyone otherwise she is a pathetic quitter who wont make the effort to keep it off. The sad thing is that if she managed to do that for a while eventually it would probably become no effort at all.  At least thats what Ive found. I was talking to a lady yesterday who would be around the same size as me AUS . She held up a pair of size  pants and said I used to wear this size and they were getting too tight. She said it was when she realised shed have to buy the next size up that she had her OMFG Im fat moment. And she went to the doctor and asked him for help. She got her food intake under control and the weight just fell off. That was  years ago.  I guess some people never have an Im fat moment. Or if they do they manage to put a positive spin on it. Or something. I have no idea how they do that since being fat feels all kinds of awful. But you know. People are weird. |,fatlogic,cohfs1u,11,t5_2wyxm

Your current eating window is four hours which is great.Since its really effective in shedding fat at least from my experience I usually do it in order to get into summer shape. It does require a pretty fixed schedule since you only have so long to eat. and I would absolutely recommend to do your workouts on empty stomach which I think has also been shown to promote weight loss and especially fat loss. Whats interesting is I have used intermittent fasting for bulking aswell. hours of not eating and then eating approx    kcal between  pm and  pm. Its tough though especially just pretty much eating lean meat and no trash food but done properly itll give you a great look without much need for cutting afterwards.,fatlogic,congcyy,2,t5_2wyxm

3167729,0,t1_copmbz2,Youre forgetting the sugar. I dont know what post this is so I cant comment on that recipe and I can also think of healthy ways to do pizza that cut out the sugar but all the processed food full of sugar is why most of the posts there dont work for me.The sub is called cheap and healthy which means they do see some food as healthy and some as not. So while I agree with you here that it doesnt matter for weight loss and could be part of a healthy diet that isnt the point of that sub.That sub is for I thought people like me who are constantly struggling to get enough calories in a day or for their children without eating a bunch of processed food that is full of sugar. We already get enough of that. I thought that sub would be a break from the eating healthy is so cheap just eat all grains and beans! that you are always told when you say eating healthy is expensive. We already eat a ton of grains and beans we need other ideas.Of course eating processed food is cheap but it isnt healthy to eat all that sugar. Which is in all the bread and is all the store bought sauces. The pepperoni probably has sugar too. When we started SCD for my daughter we had to read every label to make sure there was no sugar or wheat in it. Prepackaged the only things without added sugar were canned vegetables frozen fruits and vegetables and cheese.It might be just a little but it adds up.Just like everyone who says its just a little treat well sure but youre the forth person to offer my kids candy today and thats not counting cookies they get for snack at school every single day actually this is the reason I send their snacks instead of letting them have the cookies with everyone else. It is not a treat if you get it constantly.And yeah my kids arent fat but yes I still worry about it because I dont want them to be just not fat.

Diabetes is an illness in which the pancreas does not produce enough of a hormone called insulin. We dont know why diabetes could reduce the risk of prostate cancer.

3257774,0,t1_coznxjq,gt But if OP is suggesting no one would go hungry if nobody over ate then thats just plain foolish.How is it foolish?Im not in absolute poverty but Im barely on the right side of the line between basically independent and charity case. So I dont have much in the way of excess in my life. Yet for Lent this year I got serious about fasting twice a week in addition to giving up soda and tobacco. Just that little bit has enabled me to give more to the needy in my communitytipping more at the Salvation Army coffee shop buying some homeless people firewood and blankets that sort of thing. Is it a lot? No. But its significant. Im also able to buy enough insulin to get a bulk discount which will free me up a bit financially in the future.So if I by fasting twice a week and not drinking a litre of Diet Coke and smoking two Nat Shermans every day can make such a difference does it not stand to reason that if a person who actually spends twice as much on food as he or she needs stopped doing that they could do far more?And what if the  million or so people who spend excessively on food stopped doing that and gave even a portion of what they saved to those who were in need? I dont know how much money that would mean because I havent done the math but as a rough estimate its in the tens of billions of dollars. That would be enough to build infrastructure in the worlds poorest countries that could raise them out of starvation. It might not completely end hunger but it would be anything but foolish to propose. Unless you mean foolish as in nobodys going to listen to that idea so why bother.,fatlogic,cozoh0i,-5,t5_2wyxm

It doesnt really apply to a woman who is trying to reshape her body.I have PCOS which comes with insulin resistance so lowcarb is an absolute must for me. For women with a more normal endocrinology I dont know if it really matters. I am throwing it out there for you but honestly if you keep your calories and you reshape your body with heavy weights you will probably be fine.Also  stress amp the cortisol hormone are related to belly fat.

Pack a lunch in the morning right after breakfast or at night right after dinner. Want more food than that when lunch time comes? Tough shit. Full me knows that hungry me is a selfish Bastard that does as it pleases. Eating out puts you on the spot to get whatever you want when youre really hungry.

Nevermind the fact that from an evolutionary standpoint she is not fit enough to make a good mother so men wont naturally gravitate towards her. Yes we as a species have moved past those inborn natural instincts logically but theyre still there under the surface. Another example is that men are typically more attracted to women when theyre ovulating just ask strippers how much more they make that week and women are hornier when theyre ovulating... its our natural instinct to reproduce.

3351846,0,t1_cpaat2e,Thats an interesting article and I enjoyed reading it but it seems to cover a slightly different topic.  The mice that gained weight didnt just eat a few hours later than the thin mice.  They were fed throughout day and night interrupting their sleep cycles and fasting times.  I think having a disrupted sleep cycle alone would cause weight gain since the mice would probably be less active during waking hours.  It also seems like our bodies react to fasting in a way which helps prevent weight gain.I suppose what I said should be clarified with Youre body doesnt care when you eat so long as you sleep for eight hours a night without eating.Ive read a bit about intermittent fasting which some say helps with weight management.  So I understand that eating cycles may play a part in losing weight.  But it still seems like it doesnt matter if you eat before you sleep so long as you still have a fasting period.This was a very interesting article but it doesnt seem to prove what the sign said Dont eat after pm.  In fact it seems like the thin mice do just that.  Eat when theyre awake and then go to sleep.  Maybe they should change it to Dont eat in your sleep.  But thanks for linking the article.

I have been guilty of this in the past but try now to be more generalized with suggestions to people if they ask. I also am fairly certain other things are going on behind the scenes for diets like this of people who seem to do well on them.

Now you may be an adult and can do what you want including taking a calculated and informed health risk which if you are moderately underweight is probably within the range of acceptable for most people if sufficient compensation is involved. BUT the risks are worse in kids and young adolescents and can cause more severe problems potentially including things like lower IQ and stunted growth and minors should not be in that position. But let me ask you why are you underweight? Do you have a malabsorption disorder or something similar? If not the best explanation is that you dont eat enough kcals for someone of your height and activity level which isnt by definition a super healthy lifestyle and does put you at risk for the issues listed above. If its just a matter of meeting weightmeasurement requirements to work wouldnt it be better if those had to be set in a reasonable place so you and all your peers could work without having to take the risks of being underweight regardless of how severe they are?And would staying at a BMI of  be a huge problem for you?

My ex was passing on some genetic defect that caused the miscarriages. We only found out after years of disaster unfortunately. So Im technically perfectly capable of producing and carrying to term healthy offspring and yet Im still way too scared to try again.And for personal reasons I am not a supporter of adoption the way it works in todays reality I am adopted. So Im shit out of luck in the kids department. And thats ok. People grow lives change plans change. Does the yearning sometimes still creep up from the depth of my soul where I buried it? Most certainly. But the decision against kids is the better one for me. TLDR feeling a yearning for kids and deciding not to have any arent mutually exclusive.,fatlogic,cpq229v,8,t5_2wyxm

3519646,0,t3_30l5nq,I dont see really any major fat logic.  I also think there is one major part of genetics that IS over looked which is appetite.  I have a large appetite so I gotta not listen to my body and all that stuff but count my calories. My brother has almost no appetite never did as a little child doesnt as a  year old.  He eats often only one meal a day which he wont finish.  Hes scrawny and pretty weak but has never been fat.  Once he tried to work out for about six months and his PT got him a nutritionist.  She gave him a meal plan and he forced himself to eat and after about six months got himself a small gut.  He then moved quit working out and eating that way and is back to scrawny but thin. We have same mother same father but he is more like my mothers family I got dads side.  Genetics matter there and honestly Id rather be me than him when it comes to health.  Where genetics doesnt matter nearly as much is calories in vs out thats where the fatlogic hits hard and magical people avoid the laws of thermodynamics. The woman in that post really did get it far more right than wrong.  As a middle aged guy its a journey is slow and you just dont magically change one aspect of your eating and lose all the weight. ,fatlogic,cptgrq4,5,t5_2wyxm

3539081,0,t3_30st0o,There is some truth to what she says.It might mentally harder for her to consistently consume under TDEE because she has been fat.Due to the expression of epigenes from being fat and the ease of restocking the already increased number of now deplete fatcells losing weight and not gaining it back is a bit more unforgiving.However it is possible to prime the same onoff switches of her epigenetics back to leanness and muscle activity.If there was two versions of herVersion A same muscles but never became obese always at  bmi.Version B same muscles but became obese for years and have now slimmed down to  bmi.If version A and B both ate  calories over TDEE version B would add fat maybe  faster  and B might have to exert more willpower to not over consume.But they would both maintain weight at TDEE and lose weight at a calorific deficit.And with enough time and consistent eating and exercise the difference between them would become minimal.So yes It is harder if you have been obese but not very and not forever.,fatlogic,cpvoeoc,1,t5_2wyxm

But the special snowflake thing only works to demoralize people trying to find themselves. Identities change! Some are fluid some are stagnant some are bigger than others. Genderqueer is a real albeit new gender identity category that more people are finding themselves drawn to. Which is awesome! It means more people are finding acceptance within themselves.  Sometimes being the special snowflake can be really helpful especially for young people. Being happy with yourself is much easier in the long run than caring about the thoughts of others. Its difficult but true. But Fatlogic just fuck it. Hippy rant over. Sorry  Edit Im a little confused about the downvotes I understand what Im saying seems silly but just because something doesnt apply to everything doesnt mean it doesnt exist. Gender binaries are becoming more and more blurred every day and will continue to do so... complaining or resisting doesnt do much.

3656968,0,t3_328hi0,I realized something last night. My boyfriend wanted to go out to a certain club for a certain dj. We both enjoy occasionally getting our dance on and I was all for it except for the fact that I was running a k at  this morning. As a compromise I said Id go but I wasnt going to get dressed up and I was going to wear sneakers to save my feet. So I went out in jeans and a tshirt no makeup meh hair and sneakers. This isnt something I would usually do. I like to play dressup and I like the extra boost of confidence that comes with looking well put together. I dont like feeling sloppy and I wouldnt usually feel comfortable stepping out without putting some effort into it. Last night I DNGAF. We went out we danced we had fun we came home and I was able to jump into bed without having to deal with makeup and shit my feet were not sore and I woke up three hours later and completed a k in  all according to plan this was actually faster than I had planned to run it. It was a good morning.Anyway the point of my cool story is that I just realized why I didnt care so much about getting dressed up. First of course the race was more important to me but also I realized that I dont need to dress up to feel good about how I look. I wore skinny jeans and a fitted t shirt and sneakers and I looked better than my poundsheavier self ever would have looked in a nice dress and heels and a face full of makeup. At a heavier weight I would have looked like someone who has pretty much given up going out like that of course I would have been uncomfortable. I started working out and losing weight because I wanted to take care of my health but this is like a super bonus benefit. Ill still get done up to go out in the future but now I have more options.tldr eff your beauty standards indeed I figured out last night that you have to put a lot less effort into looking good when you actually you know look good. ,fatlogic,cq94by8,18,t5_2wyxm

3720891,0,t1_cqgas3e,Its generally good advice to keep fat off rather than focus on taking it off. Gluconeogenesis the process of converting noncarbohydrates like fat to glucose is relatively metabolically expensive. The body therefore is going to have a preference for other energy sources over fat. This is why a high fat ketogenic diet like the Atkins diet places an emphasis on eliminating carbs if there are carbs available your body is not going to engage the fat burning pathways to nearly the same degree. Bottom line fat burning is not fun. You dont really burning fat until youve deleted your glycogen stores which is just generally not a fun feeling. Its way easier to never put yourself in the position where you need to do it. ,fatlogic,cqgep1d,1,t5_2wyxm

It is part of the reason why the HAES crowd acts like it does. They do not realize what they are doing to themselves because they are not feeling the effects of their obesity. Once they start reaching their s s and s they will likely be be plagued with obesity related disease. I suppose obesity could have been the culprit at age  almost no absolutes in medicine but what if it had been age  or  which is the youngest person with CHF I have treated? Would anybody still think its the obesity primarily at fault if it have been an  year old?Of course the proof is in the pudding so to speak.

If you are eating hundreds of grams of sugar per day the pancreas and liver will convert this excess sugar especially from rapidly consumed items like drinks with no fiber content to slow digestion straight into fat. So sugar is a serious game changer and the amount of sugar being consumed daily by children it would be impossible for them to burn it off because there are actually not enough hours in the day to do so.

Thermodynamics is thermodynamics doesnt change if you eat a diet of all doritos all chicken breasts or all veggies.  kcal is  kcal whether its from a ding dong or a carrot. The differences are the energy densitiescalories in the foods compared to serving size. serving sizeroughly  oz of carrots at  calories per serving follows thermodynamics exactly the same as  serving of ding dongs. oz at  calories.If youre flushing caloriesglucose fat protein out through your urine that is a medical problem and needs to be addressed.The ONLY difference metabolism makes is the speed those calories are processed whether that be breaking down to use or building up to store. Even then this is a negligible amount of a difference.Fiber filled high calorie foodsfruits long gran brown rice have whats called a low glycemic index because the calories take a long time to digest and get absorbed by the blood. Ding dongs are basically entirely composed of the smallest unit of energy your body digests too glucose so it gets digested and absorbed extremely quickly which spikes your blood sugar releases insulin and stores that excess energy for later as adipose tissue.,fatlogic,cr434ld,1,t5_2wyxm

She logs  kcal each time but actually burns  kcal.  Shes worked hard so she deserves a treat but she doesnt want to eat back all her calories.

They are right in that shit doesnt work and if by some miracle it does it is not sustainable.The most success I have had is with my eating plan of you know that food you eat....how about eating a little less of it.

4132979,0,t3_380t4i,I think a big part of the problem people have is how easily accessible sweet food is and how easy it is to overindulge. I mean I bought  calories worth of chocolate for my boyfriend the other day that cost me just  and it was fancyass stuff without moderating his intake he could easily eat the whole thing in one sitting. In contrast it would cost more than twice as much to buy the same quantity of our favourite brand of apples in terms of calories. A Cadbury dairy milk bar has about as many calories as my breakfast does and it isnt nearly as filling. If you are someone with a problem with overeating then to be honest you probably are better off trying not to buy a lot of sweets or junk food because theyre way too easy to overindulge in if you cant restrict your consumption easily. From a public health perspective the ready availability of highcaloire lownutrition foods can be considered a huge part of the problem. Similarly we do see some particularly awful food here who the fuck deep fat fries cheesecake? that are absolutely needlessly over the top.Having said that you are right in terms of individual life choices  theres absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying high calorie sweet foods as long as you enjoy them in moderation and noone should be demonised for liking them.

Thanks for calling me on that.gt Second I just want to clarify that I hadnt actually heard starvation state used to mean that you wont lose weight if youre at a caloric deficit so that was sheer ignorance on any controversy surrounding the term on my part. I have heard it primarily in the context of dieticians who treat patients with eating disorders discussing what happens when you deprive your body of calories. It typically results in your metabolism slowing down and depending on how large of a deficit youre running it can also lead to some nonessential functions in your body stopping loss of period hair falling out etc.gt I in no way oppose people eating healthier food and getting more activity. These are good things.gt I am curious where you got the number for  calories as a healthy deficit to run. One of the biggest studies on starvation was the Minnesota Starvation Experiments and they had the participants on a diet of about  calories and it led to things like extreme weight loss obsession with food hair loss exhaustion some started to exhibit violent tendencies weird eating rituals and mental health problems. They did require participants to exercise fairly heavily but I have heard from multiple dieticians that  calories is unhealthy again these are dieticians working with eating disordered patients so its possible that theyre adjusting their presentation of facts somewhat.gt Of course theres tons of conflicting information about what an appropriate level of calories is but I had just never heard one that low.Without going into discurs between the authors or having it all appear on SRS kind of subs Olivia wrote an unchecked article for publication on Skepchick Rebecca pulled her up on it.  Looks like by me posting this thread attention and traffic has been driven to their site and the article pulled as it looks like its damaging Skepchicks reputation.,fatlogic,crtctbj,12,t5_2wyxm

But if you log what you eat and what you weigh at the same time of day every day you can start to change things to see what happens. I could see what happened when I eliminated the small sweet after dinner or the chips with the sandwiches.I think its a huge effort to actually determine the number of calories in your food but its also largely unnecessary. You want to keep eating fewer calories until you are losing weight. Unfortunately that number shrinks as you get smaller but you will see that in your logs and just keep adjusting the inputs.Im down from  to  doing that.

4191460,0,t3_38urd2,. Calories in calories out. Basic and most important rule. Record everything using NoomMy Fitness Pal.. What were the choices that caused you to get to where you are? Find them and put a stop to it. Be brutally honest because there may be some tough decisions ahead.. rfitness. rloseit are great. If your weight is off the charts see a doctor. They can recommend a nutritionist and exercises that will ease you in and put you at less risk of injury.. Do it right. Your personal safety is important. I dont give a shit that you were a marine. Fat people are more at risk of injury. If necessary see a doctor to prescribe an exercise routine. Having a leg injury will set your weight loss routine back rather than slow and steady.Motivation. Do it for yourself not for anyone else. It never works.. Look at all those HAES whales like Munster and Chastain. Your motivation is that you dont want to be like them.. Your weight loss is only a tool for a greater goal. For example if you like hiking you final goal is to be able to hike. Losing weight is so that you can reach your goal.Finally you are looking at it wrong. I cannot help you develop willpower. Willpower comes from within. All our advice is useless if you dont have the willpower. That being said heres some things to make it easier. Throw out your crappy food. Dont tempt yourself. Whenever you feel the need to cravingseat do something else for  minutes and I dont mean watch TV. Odds are your hunger will subside.It gets easier as you lose weight. Your stomach contracts skin gets better you can exercise longer etc. Your willpower can only grow.,fatlogic,cry0xj5,6,t5_2wyxm

Modern corn is so big you wouldnt even believe its a grain. I do see a HUGE difference though between an apple from a grafted clone and doritos or salami or pop tarts.

4276118,0,t1_cs7h2hw,Same here. My BMI is approx.  and Im about lbs lighter than the healthy range for my height but Ive been the same size give or take a few lbs all my adult life. I do have issues with lack of appetite on some days mainly because of nausea from IBS and migraines and IBS related G.I issues but Ive never dieted.  My dad taught me eat when youre hungry stop when youre full and thats what I do. I realise some people have problems feeling full when they should but that rule usually works for me personally. I am underweight but Im able to maintain a stable weight by having extra snacks and meals on good days to balance out the days when I cant keep food down. I dont worry about my weight at all unless Im losing. Ive seen friends go through anorexia and they had all sorts of problems which Ive never had. Ive never been unhappy with my body even when I was being bullied for being skinny and Ive never been unhappy about gaining weight. Yes Ive got health problems which make it very hard for me to put on weight but psychologically Im fine Ive got a good attitude about my body and the food I put in it. It completely appals me that people dismiss anorexia as being about vanity or a dress size I would not trade places with an anorexic person. My problems pale in comparison to theirs.  I get people assuming I have an eating disorder all the time and it doesnt offend me when they are just concerned for my sake I appreciate them caring but it does annoy me when people tell me you need to eat more as if thats helpful!  Unless youre about to give me some delicious food that you bought or cooked for me I dont want to hear your opinion on my skinny status! TLDR Wrong  youre too skinny you need to eat more Right  hey would you like some of these fresh cookies I just baked? ,fatlogic,cs7mxtu,12,t5_2wyxm

4286339,0,t1_cs8jipj,Yeah almost all fatlogic when taken back to its core stems from the belief that A being overweight or obese doesnt really affect your health negatively and B CICO is fake. They will refuse flat out to believe any evidence on the contrary no matter how many studies or real world examples you plop in their lap. There is material however weak and biased on the market that appears to support their claim and thus they will simply dismiss any evidence otherwise because they were told the false information first and believe it to be true. Thus any counterinformation must be fake simply because it contradicts the first thing they chose to believe. Its similar to Christians trying to use the Bible to contradict an athiests statement. I make no claims on the validity of either side of that particular debate but the situation itself is similar. You cannot use a source that one party believes to be false in order to prove claims to that party they will simply immediately reject it as a valid source of information.,fatlogic,cs8shvv,4,t5_2wyxm

4316683,0,t3_3afgxb,This gets brought up periodically here. Almost all diets work certainly all the popular fad ones do or they wouldnt be popular. But they are doing exactly what you said tricking you into eating fewer calories at least for awhile. Thats why most people regain after resuming a normal diet. They learned nothing.The truth has never changed and professionals have been it for at least  years Count calories keep a food journal and plan to lose  pounds per week.  Its not flashy or quick but the pace is part of the process. Its learning to be satisfied with smaller portions or to enjoy more roasted green vegetables and less buttered starches. It takes time to develop new habits and to find balance. Fad diets have you switch between uncontrolled eating and deprivation as if thats all there is. Theres no balance no new habits formed. Returning to a normal diet is frustrating because the dieter still has no selfregulation mechanism for dealing with a full range of foods. They didnt ever count the calories and weigh a reasonable slice of pie or serving of potatoes to assess how much to have or how often. They might also exacerbate some immediate rebound gain by overindulging in favorite recentlyforbidden foods. In the end they come out with a wrong mindset gtI cant live on salad! You cant expect me to never eat dessert! Life would suck if I only ate cabbage soup but if I dont I get fat! I gain weight just eating like a normal person.

Suddenly I was starving myself and I was unhealthy and what could they do to help. I said Nothing thanks since Im still fifty pounds over weight in case you havent noticed. I think some people put you in a box and dont like it when you change their perceptions of you. They make bullshit comments and try and keep you down. It makes them feel safer and more in control of their world. I was their fat but funny friend. Suddenly I wasnt morbidly obese any longer and one of their husbands basically told my husband I was cute and they freaked the hell out. Suddenly I wasnt staying in their little box any longer and they did not like that. Suddenly they noticed that I had not only achieved my goals I had moved on to round two of my goals. They hadnt changed at all in ten years. So yeah get new friends. ,fatlogic,csdfcwy,3,t5_2wyxm

If youve been eating under your limit by that much and have it to spare for a week Id say go for it personally. Some people count daily some weekly and some dont even count calories they just go by their weight trends if its up they cut back a little if its not they dont. In the end its your decision.

I used a car analogy in my post D I remembered someone else using it and thought that myself.gt Isnt the best way to make them read an article explaining this though?Youll find that people cling to small truths more aggressively when they dont want their mind changed.You hear people using BMI is inaccurate to excuse themselves from having a high BMI rather than think about it statistically. So its easier to just prove that BMI is a good positive identifier for obesity and that its inaccuracy is in under reporting it.The same is true here. People both big and small all the time talk about fast and slow metabolisms. Rather than trying to explain how that shouldnt matter if you body needs less then why are you eating more? its easier to just flat out say thats not true look here at this fact that proves its not true.The latter means that dont have to logically try to change their thought structure hard to do but instead just flat out find that what they were saying is not true. ,fatlogic,cseyxye,1,t5_2wyxm

Also from what one of my obese Muslim coworker tells me  I think Ramadan weight loss also depends on what kinds of feasts your family is preparing. By the sound of hers its not wonder shes obese  not to mention they do the same thing in the morning. Shes also the second obese Muslim Ive encountered.I sometimes do IF and am no stranger to doing planned weekly fasts a  hour fast once a week every now and again. I found the first time I did IF I was actually surprised at how little I had to eat to feel full and how infrequently I felt genuinely hungry.Most times Im too busy the first three days of the week to eat properly  maybe Ill have a light breakfast and a protein shake at lunch I pack a lunch and snacks but some days are too hectic to get to them and I run from work to my evening activitieshobbies too quickly to sit and eat food so I often end up coming home at PM having not eaten since PM or earlier. Its really only when I get home that I realize Im starved and a bit weakfeeling not a good thing but I can identify proper hunger and can now identify when Im full.Honestly I think people who have trouble with hunger cues should try fasting for a while and reconnect with their stomachs in a way.

I for one consider myself lucky that I have always been thin without really feeling as if I was having to try because I was brought up that way. Not so much genes not nature but nurture you know? We cannot deny that nurture influences ones life a lot. Doesnt mean you CANt get fit when grown up  you might just experience it as harder and face more difficulties and challenges doing so. What I find offensive though is that they throw Csection and formula into this list of bad upbringing. Csection and formula are for some women not a choice and for those who do choose it a valid choice that has nothing to do with how well they feed their children. It is cruel to the first and nasty to the second to suggest it has. Formula will not make your baby fat if you dont lace it with sugar and dont overfeed. ,fatlogic,csgu86i,27,t5_2wyxm

There is a reason why someone is Obese its because they are addicted to food and cannot let go of their own lifestyle supporting it with their own Logic and justifications to keep going. Most Obese people know why they are fat and they know how to fix it they choose not to. Blaming it on Water weight Thyroid Problems Stress etc  literally anything but the way they eat lifestyle they are addicted and will continue feeding their addiction through personal justification followed with ShortTerm Gratification food.They keep getting fatter? Must be because they were born with a slow metabolism tired of trying etc. So literally evidence does not matter or expert opinions or anything  its addiction and distorted views.Some may call it....

She began the process of getting her shit together a couple of years ago lower calorie substitutions exploring some exercises and last year I introduced her to MFP. I thought that would seal the deal.She has no diligence about it. She refuses to log when shes on her period. She gave up on MFP at one point and I asked if I could help in any way. She told me she might feel more motivated if I were also logging. I began logging and I sent her reminders and encouragement. She still didnt log. After a few weeks I confronted her and she said that she didnt like the pressure. I got mad at her excuses and contradictions deleted my MFP and told her she was on her own.She weighed herself a while ago and was happy to discover that shes lost  pounds. I congratulated her and such. Later that day I had a curious and asked from when shes measuring that weight loss. Its from a year ago. She lost  pounds in a year. I am super happy she lost weight but it also seems like not the kind of change that indicates permanence or a chance of meeting her major goals especially since lately shes been eating huge meals and has not been tracking her food. I told her I was proud but that she could be doing even better if she stuck to it more on the order of a pound a week. She became enraged and said a pound a week is way too much way too dangerous and not sustainable and refused to believe that its actually a nice slow weight loss for someone with her goals.She has a lot more fat logic in her but I cant write a novel here. I know I could have more tact and my behavior has discouraged her sometimes but Im very frustrated with how she has the tools but wont use them saying things like she knows her body and has a good idea of how many calories shes eating. If she had started taking this seriously a year ago she could already have lost  pounds and be a healthy weight or close.tldr she has the tools and knows what to do but lacks the discipline or motivation to do it and I am not good at helping.If anyone can give me advice on the best way to not be a rude ass and possibly get across to her please tell me.

Or how holocust victims managed to survive off  calories a day doing  hours of manual labor. The human body is insanely resilient.So if you think the human body is so resilient why bother even taking multivitamins?gtThats not really worth the carbohydrate intake in my opinion. Ill eat broccoli because I like it asparagus and cauliflower too. Fiber is not needed by the body. There is no need to eat  grams of fiber a day. Its a nice benefit that your body absorbs it. But there is no need to go out of your way to eat x amount of fiber.You need fiber to have regular poops. It also helps with satiety which helps you from overeating. gtIts incredibly easy to over eat junk food. Especially high in sugar food. The lack of fiber and high energy density ingredients makes it easy to over eat as you dont really get full or satisfied.And this is why fiber is important. It helps you feel full doesnt count towards your TDEE and regulates your insulin level so you dont feel like shit.gtI also think that most vegetables are pointless as a healthy food. There are exceptions kale. But when people cook up a big pan of onions carrots zucchini and peppers. Its literally just a pot of sugar. If people enjoy that I know I do great.Then stop eating the shitty vegetables? Not all vegetablesfruits are created equal. Some are obviously better than others. You can easily meet your macromicro needs by eating a balanced diet while having it taste good. It just requires you to cook shit which you may or may not want to do. gtBut eating vegetables to hit your micro nutrient needs is horribly inefficient. You have to consume large contanties of stuff like collard greens to meet your needs. Why rely on vegetables when we have access to much cheaper and easier solutions.

4442017,0,t3_3bxysw,Part of taking care of your own health is being of a healthy weight. When you ignore that you are advocating for something other than health.The concept of healthy eating is in itself just such a vague target. Sure theres obvious stuff like dont live off of twinkies and pepsi but beyond that you could mean a host of different diets. Whatever you define as healthy eating what it comes down to is that switching from overeating mcdonalds to overeating kale smoothies and quinoa burgers or whatever youre still going to stay fat. A healthy diet is not just meeting your minimum nutritional needs but eating the right amount of calories for your body. Theres no health awards for being obese on allnatural chemical free organic GMOfree gluten free local foods or something. Aside from that youre either ignoring one of the central claims of HAES or being willfully deceptive in acting as though a natural consequence of subscribing to HAES is weight loss. From the haescommunity site Very simply it acknowledges that good health can best be realized independent from considerations of size.Good health is not independent of weight. That is clearly demonstrably false. So long as they keep spreading that dangerous lie they ought to be demonized as a movement which clearly does more harm than good. Its perfectly possible to advocate that everyone take steps to take care of themselves and the body theyre in without denying the fact that overweight and obesity is a selfinflicted disease that leads to further illness disability and premature deaths no matter how healthy the obese individual believes they are. ,fatlogic,csqlncz,3,t5_2wyxm

4493464,0,t1_cswwjdj,I see complacency as the biggest killer in relationships and obesity is both a cause and effect of this.I feel for your friend and Ive seen it in many relationships including my own parents. This is why I look for a girl who has an ideal to stay fit through her life. My girlfriend right now humble brag is hot but more than that I know she strives to stay hot not just for me but also for herself. Because of this I am motivated to getstay in good attractive shape not just for myself but also so I am attractive to her. This extends to other pursuits in life such as career and education too. We feed off of each others drive to be better. I feel that when one of a couple gets obese and that attraction is gone the other is more likely to get complacent.

Between that and very limited use of my arms for the first several weeks I basically just gave in and ate like shit. I put on  lb from just bingeing constantly.

The truth is that CICO works for every single person. Just that the number of calories you consume or burn isnt going to be the same as everyone else. At the risk of sounding like a fatlogic heretic I suspect that some medications do interfere with your TDEE. But that still doesnt mean that you cant lose weight. It just means that you have to eat fewer calories than you would otherwise. CICO always works for everyone.

They had a young patient early s not too long ago that came in for some sort of stomach surgery I wont attempt to guess which one specifically because Im not familiar with the medical terminology but they had her on a very restrictive diet for a while afterwards to let everything heal up. A few days after surgery my wife went in to work one morning to find out the patients stomach had literally ripped open overnight. Turns out her mom was concerned for her health since they were feeding her so little and was sneaking in food. She ate a good portion of a large pizza and it nearly killed her.

Fermented milk products are also easier for those who are lactose intolerance to digest.  Yogurt counts as one of those.  Interestingly the milk used to make yogurt is often a little higher in lactose due to the introduction of more milk solids. However after the fermentation process the lactose is reduced to about .Lactose intolerant reactions are doserelated.  Many people with lactose intolerance can tolerate about  grams without significant discomfort. Additionally every lactose intolerant person has a different lactase production ex none at all to only having a small reduction from normal. So exact levels of tolerance will vary.  Fermented yogurt and sour cream should be better tolerated than nonfermented dairy but it depends on the exact sensitivity amount of lactase left being produced of the consumer.,fatlogic,ctcx652,1,t5_2wyxm

4640943,0,t1_ctez5t4,I think its because its heavily skewed toward lifters over there who are so used to having to eat more to gain muscle. I dunno.  I got heavily downvoted once when I said I ate below my BMR was backing up another woman who was getting scolded for doing so and that it was necessary to do so if I wanted to lose weight faster than a snails pace. Put the calorie math in the post and everything.  I even asked for the people downvoting to explain why what I was doing was wrong.  Not a peep.In another bit of the same thread they used Oprah as an example of eating too few calories.  A person posited that Oprah got big again because she restricted to much.  I was like no Oprah got big again because she went back to eating too much.  Again downvoted.And even in one of the books I see frequently recommended there The New Rules of Lifting for Womae the book claims you need to eat more to lose weight. Maybe that might work for losing fat for those women who have very little fat to lose and instead need to do body recomposition through building muscle.  But when youve significant amounts to lose you really must be cutting  calories a day if your TDEE allows for it. Otherwise weight loss is going to take fucking forever.xxfitness is great if you want a form check or to discuss foods for bulking or ranting about womens issues in the maledominated weight room.

4665512,0,t1_ctighc3,It is though. It is a case of speak like a man or how we perceive that a man should speak because of the language we systematically teach children to adhere to. Girls are to say sorry and excuse me and to talk in terms of Sorry just wanted to check if you have those mockups done yet rather than Are the mockups done. If we train women and men to have different ways of expressing themselves and we dismiss the female way of talking as less worth than the mans way of talking that is an issue.Or if you would rather like to argue that women and men talk differently by nature it becomes even more of an issue.The thing here is not simply that we want people to be direct confident and aggressive what is worse... that should not be the only thing standing between you and the promotion your coworker just got. Women who are direct confident and aggressive also often get labelled bitches bossy and in some cases dykes. That is the backside. Be a bitch or sit down and get passed over.Why do we value the people who are direct confident and aggressive when men are most likely to be the ones acting like that? Because the leadership in our western worlds is predominately male because we are so used to think about leadership success and the like as needing male characteristics because men are historically the leaders in our superficial understanding of the past.Why is the hunter more venerated than the gatherer?

And this talk and act like men thing doesnt make a whole lot of sense either since youre conflating admittedly male dominated corporate culture with male. Do you think a workingclass man would have an easy time fitting in in a boardroom meeting? Of course not culture and class are obviously more important than sex. And Id argue that the problem lies in how we raise our daughters moreso than in corporate culture itself I dont think women are biologically less assertive than men. Im not arguing against Patriarchy Theory per se by the way nor am I against feminism. I think a very good case can be made for a sensible version of a patriarchy that does shed light on our Western cultures but unfortunately most of the time more serious feminists fail to take class into consideration and internet feminist simply use it as a faceless bogeymanconspiracy to blame everything on a vaguely academicsounding external factor thats notexplicitlymenbutsureashelldoesimplyjustthat.

4666984,0,t1_ctimwct,With certain foods I find the more I eat the more I want. I can do fine keeping my diet on my own but around family the treats come out and eventually I say yes. It starts usually because its within my caloric intake etc. but then I have some of what is my favourite kryptonite and the next day I want it more. And the next and next. Apparently junk food is designed to be like this  the trifecta of sugar salt and fat that makes us crave it and never feel full. Im a very intuitive eater who goes from yum to ugh Im full in a single bite and rarely overeats. The only real weight gain I experience is from junk food where that off switch never kicks in. I slowly gain a little cut out the junk food and then lose it rinse and repeat. I used junk food to wean myself off alcohol but then gained  pounds and found myself having to wean myself off junk food. Im not about to blame all my problems on food manufacturers but I do think differently about food now that my reactions to junk food were so similar to alcohol. Perhaps the addiction is overeating not regular eating whether its a certain food or the euphoria that comes with putting a thousand calories in our bodies in an hour. If it helps I keep drinking moderately by using specific rules designed to keep me safe and healthy  a max of  drinks per week max  at any one time and I abstain for minimum  days of the week. Each week resets on Monday and Im basically committed to tracking this forever. I did this after a year of abstaining because I didnt like the fear of falling off the wagon and wanted to deal with changing my habit. Perhaps junk food and overeating would benefit from similar rules. A year of cleansing then scheduled reintroduction of treats for birthday parties weekend dessert etc. as appropriate.,fatlogic,ctitsqk,1,t5_2wyxm

4678081,0,t3_3f0vst,Story time! So to start out with some credentials. Over the past  years I have lost over  pounds. The most I can remember weighing was  back around . When I started actually counting calories and really putting my heart into it I was at . As of last week I was at . Throughout this whole process Ive come to realize how much I would mindlessly eat sweet stuff without actually enjoying what I was consuming. Im not sure I would say I had an addiction to sugar or anything but I definitely had no concept of too much.So one super embarrassing story that still makes me cringe thinking about today happened my first year of college. I took a sociology class and we had to split into groups and do projects throughout the semester that entailed audience participation. My partner and I did a domestic violence coloring book fun and educational! Another particular group on presentation day came in with two cakes. One cake was a jumbled mess that looked like it was dropped kicked across a sand dune. The second was plated had chocolate icing smoothed on top colorful sprinkles and looked like a quality piece of awesome. The group gave everyone cake and said we could choose which one we wanted sand dune cake or chocolate awesome cake. I of course asked for the sexy chocolate cake a big piece please. As they started their presentation I looked around the room and the majority of students had taken the pretty chocolate cake but didnt eat any of it. They were just sitting on their desks WTF. As the presentation continued we learned their topic was dont judge a book by its cover. Or Dont judge a cake by its looks. The point of the project was that the dump truck cake was a regular cake that had just been mixed up and crumbled to LOOK unappealing while the chocolate cake was made to look beautiful but was actually made with ranch dressing oregano ketchup and all kinds of gross stuff. They were right in assuming people would choose the beautiful cake based on looks but not eat it because it tasted bad they proved their point. However I ATE MY ENTIRE GIANT PIECE and I didnt even notice the nasty flavor. I just tasted the sweet sugar and downed that thing. I was so embarrassed because people actually noticed that I actually finished my piece while no one else did. They did of course allow people that took the nasty cake to get some regular cake which I of course accepted. Through the embarrassment of eating dump cake I went up and got a second piece of delicious cake to suck down. I think of that story pretty often when Im ravaging a meal especially something sweet to remind myself to actually taste what Im eating and enjoy it. ,fatlogic,ctk7y51,281,t5_2wyxm
4678342,0,t3_3f0vst,My family was poor the first  years of my life. I remember as a child exclaiming were rich! when we had a full fridge which was rare. Food was a sign of happy times and I envied the kids who could afford to go to McDonalds after school. We were broke. At events like family functions we were actively encouraged to fill up. We would make a challenge out of it a practice that would continue even after we were no longer living paycheck to paycheck. For the most part we were all at a healthy size since holidays and birthday parties didnt happen frequently enough for us to pile on the weight. Fast forward a few years. My brother is in college with several scholarships enough to cover his tuition three or four times over and we have enough money to eat out constantly.Allyoucaneat places were our favorites and we encouraged each other to overeat. It was always a challenge and we ate until it hurt. We all gained some weight my brother and I especially but it felt normal because fatness creeps in slowly  a few pounds here and a few pounds there over months. Portion sizes at home ballooned too. When I wanted cereal I would fill up the entire bowl and add sugar or a banana... then go back a few minutes later for more. Soda or juice accompanied all my food. Nutrition didnt matter. If I wanted to buy two hamburgers and make that a meal it was a meal. An inbetween meals snack was a bottle of coke and a bag of chips  calories!. At new restaurants I would sometimes order two of whatever it was I wanted without knowing the serving size. Pizza would never survive past the day it was ordered  if there was any left I would eat it until there wasnt. I am just appalled looking back. At my fattest I was  pounds and Im not sure how I didnt manage to get bigger than that. ,fatlogic,ctk94jy,55,t5_2wyxm

But if you retain a healthy low weight for a long period of time your body will end up with fewer fat cells to store excess calories with.But thats all kind of irrelevant to maintaining  a healthy body weight because the amount of calories you consume will always determine what weight youre at. Even if you were lean all your life those fat cells that you have can grow to insane proportions if they have the fuel to store. Its also very easy to trigger your body to build more cells if you overeat regularly. But those fat cells can also shrink down to what seems like nothing if they arent given enough excess calories to store.So no matter what your body composition its not the fat cells that make you fat. Its the food you stuff into your fat face that makes you fat. Stay on a diet be a responsible adult dont overeat.,fatlogic,ctx2hkm,18,t5_2wyxm

I mean seriously people shouldnt be allowed to select a partner based on qualities they find attractive weight height personality general looks compatibility they should instead be forced to be with whoever they date first be it blind date Internet or set up or one born out of chance encounter or whatever other way. That way that fat person gets someone even though the other person starts to show disgust more and more openly as time goes on as its not their thing. That short guy with the tall girl gets more and more insecure as people stare because it looks an odd match yea people can be judgy. The whole argument of fat acceptance boils down to Please stop perceiving us in the way your instincts tell you instead find us as attractive as if we were thin. Dont get me wrong a little bit of weight is not that bad our perception of most attractive waist line constantly goes up and down but I hear a lot of people saying the media is forcing a super skinny image these days but that doesnt matter theres little chance of breaking the upper barrier of what most people find attractive to such a degree that size  maybe lower but I dont know womens sizes or  inch waists gain wide desirability. I aint the most attractive guy I dont have a brad Pitt face should I complain that people need to start accepting this as just as attractive?

4806632,0,t1_cu01lj1,There are a few problems with multivitamins Ill tldr it if it seems boring.The main problem is that different minerals and vitamins compete in your blood for good chemical binding spots zinc can slow protein synthesis iron interferes with zinc absorption calcium interferes with iron and zinc absorption. Phosphorus can interfere with vitamin D uptake. Another is over dosing. A lot of people with high blood pressure prescriptions shouldnt take multivitamins with potassium in them.A lot of the Caucasian population has an issue with breaking down folic acid which is the synthetic form of folate used in multi vitamins there is a problem with this because most bread supplemented milk and supplemented dairy contains it and when it builds up in your blood you can feel very unwell. This is called the MFTHR gene mutation current estimates sit at  being mildly affected and  being seriously affectedThen there is the whole B debacle some multivitamins have the wrong form many have way too much a lot of B supplements are really supposed to be taken fortnightlymonthly rather than daily.What I would recommend if you can be bothered is to consider which multivitamins you actually need usually iron zinc calcium a b group and magnesium are the ones people seem to have trouble with. Take calcium first thing in the morning with your breakfast if you like. I have a powdered calcium I like to add to smoothies or on cereal but you can get it as a tablet combined with D and magnesium which is useful.Take zinc and iron with lunch and dinner. Try to take the zinc with a lower protein meal but its not too important as long as the dose isnt too high. If its not animal based take the iron with something with citrus in it tomato or fruit being the obvious choices and leave a half hour gap either side of tea coffee or wine which stops you absorbing iron.Take a b group vitamin as you need it usually people only really need them if theyre run down because theyre supplemented into a lot of foods. If you can stay away from folic acid a form of B supplements because from what I can tell theyre actually pretty harmful for a lot of people and its just taking a while for the information to make it to the general public. My doctor diagnosed me with the MFTHR gene mutation by blood test and since Ive stopped eating supplemented foods I feel a lot better.,fatlogic,cu0eyze,6,t5_2wyxm

I dont even want to think about the fact that I was likely far larger than that. But the RA is primarily affecting my hips I was using a cane and walking with a heavy limp so it was always my excuse. I cant do that because of my condishuns! Ugh.I work at a library and I started checking out the DVDs for senior citizens doing chair exercises. Figured if I didnt have to move too much itd work out a bit better. And it definitely did! Eventually I got out of the chair and used it as support. Still have to use something but Ive been working on my legs hips and lower torso. Just wanted to get more muscle in my core maybe it would support my body better. That was the whole idea.So now Ive dropped a couple of pant sizes can shop in the larger sections of normal stores and not the plus sizes. Hell I can fit into Levi jeans now which I couldnt do before because of the slimmer hip sizes. Granted there are days where I have severe swelling but I wait for the flareup to pass and go back to working out.Beyond that I switched out my lunches at work and several times a week with grilled chicken salads. Spinach romaine lettuce kale etc along with veggies. No more soda for the most part. Its an infrequent treat instead of  ounces a day. My taste buds have changed so much just with a couple of changes that its driving me crazy! Everything is too sweet!Does anyone have a suggested exercise for upper thighs? The top and inner parts I definitely need more muscle support in that area. Am still getting the joint giveouts from time to time. Hell any ideas about hip exercise as well!

4874815,0,t3_3hnh4q,The problem with this argument is that although her bones could support her dream weight of  lbs of fat her joints cannot. The extra weight of even a few hundred pounds stresses the knees extremely harshly. Its also important to know that the neck of your femur supports about three times as many pounds of force as you weigh due to angularity and body structure.So why is muscle weight easier on your body than fat weight? Your muscles support your joints while fat strains them. Your muscles not only move your joints but they also keep them in their proper place and orientation. For some muscles such as the four rotator cuff muscles this is their main function. As your muscles grow larger your joints grow stronger. As you grow fatter your joints become strained and weakened. Secondarily the stronger your muscles are the stronger your bones will become. This is why one of the first treatments suggested for both osteoporosis and osteoarthritis is weight training.Fatties gonna fat though.edit words.

4919711,0,t1_cuemvjo,Im not sure thats a true statement.  Even a small fraction of meat is significant considering the calorie content per unit weight.  Some outline here but the crux of it is that eating a plant based diet requires an inordinate amount of feeding time for the same amount of calories.  Eating meat was the only way to pin down enough calories to grow more neurons.As far as environmental impact goes I will admit Im a lay person.  I expect that the primary concern is the high price of water and grazing area required for generating feed animals and the fact that farmers are more likely to raise more animals per square foot than the animals themselves might like.  I tend to agree with that but that doesnt mean I have anything against eating meat that Ive hunted or for that matter that I bought in the store because it was raised exclusively for that purpose and I would rather it be used than wasted.  I very strongly doubt that you can create a meat free diet with no meat that you could not create with meat.  Further I think meat as an added benefit because plant materials cannot provide as I understand B creatine D DHA and so on.  While it may be more environmentally conscious Im not sure a plant based diet is beneficial to individual health in the long term.All that said I like to learn and I value the exchange reddit provides so please feel free to share your thoughts!,fatlogic,cueo274,2,t5_2wyxm

Its just more clean that way.Theres one thing I wanted to mention though how Mindful and Intuitive eating are being lumped in as kind of the same or similar thing but I believe they are very different.Intuitive eating the right kind I think is well described but my understanding of mindful eating is basically that its the opposite of mindless eating. This is what sever binge eating is speaking from experience where you just eat eat eat and barely even aware that youre eating but its an activity thats almost automated. In general mindfulness practice up to and including meditation is a conscious effort to be aware of what it going on in the moment. Mindful eating is that same effort applied to eating where you put all your attention to what youre eating focusing on details like how it looks smells all the nuanced tastes and enjoying every bite which is why its such a good tactic for fighting binges.Maybe I just happen to know one definition of it and there are other uses so Im not flat out saying youre wrong but it seems wrong to me and I wanted to bring it up just in case.Keep up the great work!,fatlogic,cuj6ax7,3,t5_2wyxm

Instead of using the vacation as an excuse to eat shitty convenience store rice balls I prepared home cooked meals nearly every day. Lots of veggies eggs tofu and kimchi for my girlfriend and I. Despite what many people think it is easy to get fat in Japan. Lots of cheap readily available junky snacks and fast food restaurants and fruits and veggies are much more expensive there than they are in Canada. But I wasnt going to gain weight and feel like crap around my girlfriend so I spent the extra money on groceries and stayed as healthy as I could during my time there. The home cooked meals the extra walking and the fact that I shared my treats with my girlfriend lead to a tiny bit of weight loss! When my Mum picked me up from the airport one of the first things she said was that I looked really good. Translation you lost weight and have been eating well. It was nice to hear that Ive stayed on track with my weight loss and Im now around  pounds at  down from  at the beginning of April. My goal is to get to  by my friends wedding this Christmas. After than Ill maintain go back to Japan in February and hopefully be able to fit into some of the super cute Japanese fashions could only fit into plus size clothing this time. More than that I want to show my girlfriend the hard work Ive put in to get the body I want.

Because the s housewife was on a diet always as well. The fashion was a priority and they didnt have plus sizes much yet only for MILs. The war was just over or in case of some actresses still going. There was no reserve to waste fabrics on and some foods were also rationed. And with men overseas many women had to do physical labour to take over. Calories were burned! These women worked hard for their looks. Rita Hayworth got laser surgery to get her signature hair Marilyn Monroe had surgery those other ladies were all about diet and exercise and just were very quiet about their other procedures. It wasnt painless. And many of these women were also dancers to start with.,fatlogic,cuqvuij,64,t5_2wyxm

I thought it would be pretty interesting with plenty of healthy vegan things to eat. I wondered if it was going to be a lot more food because it would be all healthy food but after the first meal almost everything was straight junk food!I thought it would be unique but it was just another straight gorge fest that someone was able to technically claim was vegan but was still just eating chips candy and ice cream.

Surely it should be less expensive as these sizes wont be sold as often.lets use tees to explain this. sizes SML will cover  of the people who walk in your store and every size up from there will have diminishing returns. if you stocked even just one of each garment sized for a lb person youd be lucky if you sold one or two so you would have all this unsold stock that you would never get a return on. anything outside the bell curve of body types will lose money in an average store. this is why tallfat stores existre your other points you are correct,fatlogic,cv3kt1w,7,t5_2wyxm

Is it something you want to look forward to so you stick to your diet the rest of the time?  Does it break the monotony of the hunger and is that important to you?  Regardless of whether it has anything to do with the biochemistry of muscle gain if it really matters youll feel it and you can decide if its worth it.  Personally I do this intermittent fasting thing so its easier to have an amazing meal I look forward to every day where I get full and satisfied and I dont really mind the  hours of being hungry.  To me its actually been very important longterm to have food I look forward to every day and on previous diets I dont think I could have made my goals without having a cheat meal once per week because it allowed me to gain the willpower to stick with it the rest of the week.  ,fatlogic,cv60d39,1,t5_2wyxm

5174302,0,t1_cv90lcn,I know Im being a dick. I know Im going to be downvoted and Im sorry but I have to say this.If you dont actually have ADHD or another neurological disorder that requires amphetamines or methylphenidates etc please dont use them. Its drug abuse. Period. And I dont give a shit about what you do to your body but when people go into a doctors office and lie about having ADHD or buy pills off prescription from someone who does it hurts people who actually have ADHD.First that medication puts us on an equal footing with people who dont have a genetic neurological disorder. If your class is graded on a curve youre basically fucking those classmates over. Its like if two guys go into a fitness competition and one uses steroids and the other doesnt  especially if steroids are against the rules. If you have a sense of fairness you wont use ADHD meds.Second go over to the ADHD subreddit and youll see how many people specifically college kids complain about the fact they went to the doctor for meds and basically got told to fuck off because the doctor thought they were just another college kid begging for drugs. Then they basically have to jump through hoops for six months to get a script. That isnt just six months worth of homework. Thats six months of everything. ADHD affects every part of our lives.Third its not enough that we have to live with this disorder and the stigma every single day. The dirty looks the disappointment the frustration. Like were lazy like we dont care like were irresponsible. Medication is hands down the best treatment for this disorder. And so many people have no idea because of the stigma against it. Ive spent  years of my life in some level of depression. I failed out of college was fired from a job lost all my friends and became a piece of shit because of my untreated ADHD. And a big part of that stigma is people abusing it. Those of us who do use ADHD have to fight against the stigma of using it because people abuse it. Again go over to the ADHD subreddit and youll see how many people have had their lives fall apart because of untreated ADHD. Or how many people who have had issues with their family friends employers and partners because they start taking medication.Im sure youre not a bad person but I dont think you realize that even in a small way youre making it harder for people who do actually have ADHD to get the treatment they need. Have some respect for the very real struggle we have to go through.soapbox,fatlogic,cv9oz6m,2,t5_2wyxm

Ill treat this like I would fat logic and its going to sound harsh. Just because you eat vegan  of the day doesnt mean youre not contributing to animal agriculture and the environmental impact that it has. A gallon of dairy milk is  gallons of water for example and its my belief youre just justifying your behavior by eating like that. If youre choosing to eat vegan for health benefits then why not commit the other third? If you just like plants then whats another third? Ive been down voted before for bringing up veganism in threads that mention it before but to me many excuses people have for not living a vegan lifestyle is similar to fat logic reasons for not eating healthy and people down vote because it challenges there belief system just as HAES acceptors would down vote things that challenge their beliefs. Both of this things are true though veganism is less harmful to the environment and you dont have to killtorture any animals if anyone disagrees that those arent pros then Id say theyre lying. Being a normal weight is better your health if anyone says thats not true Id say theyre lying.

5285956,0,t1_cvnawem,It gives validity to claims that the sub is about hating fat people rather than about opposing the mindset of helplessness about weight.  Which from what people here claim to be the case should interfere with the point of the sub.  Its supposed to be about improving is it not?  Making progress with your weight your health your fitness.  Not about discouraging and looking down on people deemed to be inferior.  Empowerment not discouragement.  Isnt it?Honestly I suspect that most of the people disparaging somebody elses pace dont actually run themselves.  Its pretty rare to find a runner who looks down on somebody who is putting in the effort.  People who run tend to be more aware that simply running at all can be difficult especially for beginners.  This isnt FPH.  People on the internet may like to exaggerating their accomplishments but here it undermines the purpose.  Is it really okay on this sub to say that running isnt running if its not up to some particular standard?  Isnt the point to encourage progress and not to insult their progress based on somebody elses abilities?  If its not its just FPH in disguise.   I hope thats not true.  ,fatlogic,cvnccpk,17,t5_2wyxm

They did an EKG and sent me to the emergency room where they did a CT scan and confirmed a massive clot. Moral of the story for anyone you know when something isnt normal. Not being able to breathe is NOT NORMAL. If your doc doesnt listen push for another one. PEs are easy to diagnose and can be fatal very quickly. I got lucky very very lucky.

Its weird not relevant and is arguably a weird sort of food policingfood moralizing I know I cant believe Im saying that that really grates me. In general I think its really immature to comment on someones food choices as an adult just because they arent the ones you would make. Its completely possible to indulge now and then and still maintain a healthy weight and engage in habits that are by and large very healthy. No no one needs cake but enjoying an indulgent meal or treat now and then doesnt have to be a kiss of death. I used to be fat. I loved sweet then I love them now.

5314689,0,t3_3nrvd7,Warning This is really long.I have lost  pounds. In  I weighed  lbs. As of today I currently weigh . Im  and female.Here is around Thanksgiving . Pictures of this era are very scarce. I hardly did anything. I would literally wake up around noon log onto World of Warcraft and start eating. Id eat all day. All day every day it was WoW and constant food. Multiple fast foods a day. My favorite was Jack in the Box. Id get the double bacon cheeseburger with a medium curly fry and dr pepper... twice a day. This was along with other snacks. It wasnt always JitB but I did have a favorite item from at least a dozen fast food chains.    More pictures of that time period    Christmas     One of the only pictures I ever saved. It was one of hundreds I took trying pleading with myself to not be stuck like this anymore. I cried about my weight on a daily basis. It was a very hard few years. I wasnt always obese but I was always overweight. Ive struggled with binge eating and my relationship with food still isnt as great as it should be but Im getting there. Anyway in  I finally saw  hit on the scale and realized enough is efuckingnough. This ends now. I got LoseIt! on my iphone and started walking every single night for about an hour around my neighborhood. I lost  lbs after  months and finally hit . This was when I started to feel good again. It was working! It was fucking working you guys! I was ecstatic that I could finally FINALLY see a difference after months of losing weight with nothing to show for it. This was the day I had lost  lbs. I dont know why I remember that specific number of weight loss but it was the first time I had finally started to feel actually good again. I had lost this after  months from when I started. I then very slowly lost the next  lbs over the course of the next year. Then when I had gotten back down to my high school weight  I guess I just stopped. I stopped counting calories and started gaining a little weight back. Ive looked and weirdly cant find any pictures of this time period. I had gotten back to about  about  years ago when I again decided I needed to get this shit under control. And here I am now. And Ive included some NSFW photos. This one because I did some killer cardio today and feel awesome and kinda want to show off.    And heres an album of what my weight loss has done to my torso. Its not pretty you guys.And here is proof that Im real. Thank you for making it this far.

In life we only feel conflicted where the other side has a good point even if its not as good as ours and conflicts with ours. Your point that they arent paying you for the hours and therefore youre not obligated to go makes perfect sense.Maybe theres another way to integrate with the group.

5350430,0,t1_cvvkmdk,gtIncredibly shortsighted advice about starting your day off with a bunch of sugar which while giving you energy indeed will likely lead to a crash.That was one of the biggest things I noticed about the article itself. The author ate ALL THE TIME probably because she wasnt eating anything with protein or fat the two macronutrients that make you feel satiated for long periods. She said I have my juice at around  am then my  Im hungry and need a snack so I have some MampMs then at  I usually have my chocolate coffee because Im starting to feel tired. Then at  I need another pick me up so I have oatmeal with peanuts for lunch. Later at around  Im hungry again so I have more MampMs then at  its officially lunch time so I grab some more oatmeal because Im usually starting to feel peckish... and so on and so forth. Basically eating every halfhour to an hour because she was hungry again.Youd think a dietitian and nutritionist would know that heavily processed carbs like candy fruit juice not the good kind it was Tropicana Orange mixed with Ocean Spray Cranberry for the antioxidants and non steelcut oats cause your blood sugar to rise then crash soon after leading to feelings of hunger.

5370855,0,t3_3okve2,Here is me writing a book that no one asked for saying stuff im sure a lot of people will disagree with.... If you read on youve been warned! The short of the book referenced in the video good calories bad calories is Sugarcarbs raise insulin levels. High insulin levels cause fat cells to get fatter. Gary Taubes the author of that book took  years and went back to research from the s to now to try and figure out the obesity epidemic. I personally cant except his statement that consuming excess calories does not cause us to grow fatter any more than they cause a child to grow taller. Expending more energy than we consume does not lead to long term weight loss it leads to hunger. However after reading his book and then checking his sources and also doing other research I have come to the conclusion that a high calorie diet with high amounts of sugarcarbs and low activity levels causes fat gain. Also your body doesnt react the same to all foods. If i ate at  calories but only drank soda id be starving. I would have to eat. Same with if i could manage to eat  calories of donuts or just junk food in general. High carb high sugar foods dont fill you up like a healthy foods. There is no way i could eat  calories of broccoli in one day... Thats almost  lbs of broccoli! That to me is proof a calorie  a calorie.  If i need more of one calorie than another in order to feel full its just not equal. I think when people talk about calories in calories out they arent thinking deeper. Your body is much much more complex than that. It just doesnt react to all food the same. Yes if you threw me in a locked room and made me eat a low calorie diet thats high in sugar Id likely lose weight. But i would be hungry feel miserable and likely develop health issues. So if im trying to lose weight restricting my calories by eating a healthy bowl of special K some granola bars with a banana tomato soup with toast some pasta with chicken and the jarred spaghetti sauce... Im likely to still feel hungry at the end of the day. Ive eaten at  calories but Ive consumed gs of sugar and  of my diet was carbs. My insulin levels are high and if  Im insulin resistant thats a problem. If i eat protein and veggies at the same calorie limit however i wont feel hungry at the end of the day.My point being calories matter but for the most sustainable weight loss you have to change the foods you eat too. I dont think Gary Taubes meant for his research to be taken as my fat cells are greedy not my fault im fat! Guess i can eat at  calories a day! i dont think he is encouraging people to eat at high ass calorie levels. Hes saying that if you change the foods you eat your body will become less insulin resistant. You wont be as hungry so  youll need less food. He views high calorie diets as a side effect of being fat. You eat more because your hungry. Your hungry because of the foods you eat. Ive gone on long enough.

5374741,0,t3_3ole4e,Okay to set the back story Im a transitioning vegan who also maintains caloric deficit.

So my family tend to see me eating larger than norml meals or frequent small snacks. My calorie deficit is for weight loss vegan lifestyle for healthethical reasons. Simple enough right?My family seem to think my magical diet of eating plants is the way I am suddenly losing lbs so far but on a  frame its obvious. I mentioned when I heard my aunt entertain the idea of taking dangerous laxatives that my way of eating allows me to lose weight and stay healthy. I tried to explain CICO so she could understand that if she just entertained the idea of eating less she could easily lose weight on the food she eats too not just my lifestyle but nope.

Fitness level and athletic experience e.g. swimming ability and know how to ride a bike will play a big part. It also depends on what ones goals are.Youll hear about people training  hours a week which some do. Many of those people elite athletes compared to the general population could stop training tomorrow for an ironman  months away and still finish under the  hour cutoff. For those people its not about finishing an Ironman  they know they can do that  they want to be the absolute best they can be and see what theyre capable of when they give their training everything they have. They could be targeting  or  hours. If one just wants to finish and be labeled an Ironman one still has to be obsessive just not to that level.If youre interested in triathlon you should give the Sprint distance a shot. Its  a  meter swim  mile bike ride and  mile run. You dont need a wetsuit you dont need a special bike you can use whatever bike you have  even if itsa beater you dont need a coach  the only investment you need to put in is time and work and maybe a new pair of running shoes.If you want to climb Mt.

5422871,0,t1_cw4b4e2,I have read in the Science and Art of low carb living and also from DR Atkins in the great nutritional debate that low carb diets generally provide more rapid weight loss than high carbohydrate diets even when caloric intake is controlled for i.e. in isocaloric academic studies. There are many  isocaloric studies available that show weight loss differentials between different diets even some which show greater weight loss with higher caloric consumption... For example you can find on nutritionfacts.org some studies comparing a standard diet of set calories to a diet of higher calories with mandatory nut consumption and the nut group lost more weight over time.Now as far as the problem with the ketogenic diet. The ketogenic state is not the primary functional state of the human body and that is the fundamental problem. Its stupid pulling guys off the bench when your front line up is working. If its not i.e. you have insulin resistance probably  of people who perse a keto diet have this problem in some capacity you can reversecontrol this using a healthy high carbohydrate diet i.e.  of calories from whole unrefined plant foods.The other big problem with the ketogenic diet is that it is typically laden with rich animal foods like meat dairy and eggs which contribute to chronic illness and decreased mortality. The fact that a low carb diet based on plants foods did not show this and showed an improvement in health is more evidence of this.Synopsis of mortality study Full PDF of mortality study Plant based low carb study synopsis Plant based low carb study full text Video summary of findings if yer too lazy to read through that,fatlogic,cw4ttx7,-1,t5_2wyxm

5437039,0,t3_3pig21,The biggest issue I have with this is that theres a partial truth to it. There is before going into things like plastic surgery only so much control a person has over how their body looks. You cant control what jawline you were born with how your nose is shaped and your general frame  and I can see where that can be difficult to deal with for some. You might look at Taylor Swift as being what one should look like but youre  with wide hips and will never look like that no matter how hard you try. For this I can fully get behind loving oneself regardless of mainstream beauty standards.But that doesnt mean that just because you didnt hit the genetic lottery to be a  just by rolling out of bed you should become a landwhale. If you love anyone including yourself you should want that person to be the best them they can be.

There was certainly no need to eat  calories a day!I could consume quite a large amount on days where Id run  or  miles  or so calories for someone my size and breastfeed an exclusively milkfed baby... but those days arent every day and Im cutting back on the feeding now. Most of my feeding is done via pumping and bottle feeding DO NOT RECOMMEND so its easy to control the journey towards drying up.

5567177,0,t1_cwms6gy,When I was big I blasted my palate with extremely fatty salty sugary foods. I ate portion sizes that were totally out of control. Putting me in front of a huge plate of food was like handing a child the keys to Willy Wonkas Chocolate Factory and saying Here go nuts. I didnt understand much about nutrition beyond the  Food Groups diagrams from school and certainly didnt understand what  serving of grains looked like. I ate stuff I didnt even remember eating like on that Secret Eaters show.Under that circumstance I couldnt reliably intuitively eat because I had no ability to hear what my body was saying. My intuition was shot. I had to learn that intuition as I lost weight. Now Im pretty good at differentiating cravings from needing more vegetables or fruit or whatever in my diet but I still weigh stuff and keep track of portion sizes because I know I have trouble sometimes when given the keys to the chocolate factory. I see supermorbidlyobese women say intuitive eating as a substitute for eating whatever the hell I want when I want it in as great a quantity as I want it. It sounds sciencey and its meant to shut down any judgment or criticism and to of course give them an excuse to go hog wild eating absolute shit in excess. And the funny thing is I try not to judge someone for what they eat. I wish I could say to them Eat what you want. You dont have to make sciencey sounding excuses for it to me.

5596138,0,t1_cwqootp,Dont worry this kind of messaging is usually sponsored by the brands themselves in convoluted ways. They tend to hold conferences where the doctors attend and theyre paid for them handsomely. Nothing in writing obviously. The tobacco industry did the same.They will make claims such as saying its the quantity that matters which are obviously at face value correct. But then their entire business model and billions spent in marketing including sponsoring schools and even charity drives against diabetes is hinging upon people consuming large quantities of food. They have a huge influence. Remember when Michelle Obamas campaign against child obesity used to focus on what the kids were eating and how much junk they had available in school? Do you really think the morphing into a lets move campaign which advocates absolutely useless methods of weight management in children i.e. gym class twice a week is a coincidence?This is not a conspiracy theory. This is the influence of the food industry. It was present when the food pyramid was established and its present now. Just like cigarette manufacturers they have an incentive to put forward individual responsibility and willpower to highlight free choice and to pretend like people can exercise away the billions and billions of calories they have to sell for next quarters earnings report to show growth to their investors.If people actually ate in moderation theyd lose money.So yeah junk food and soda dont really matter. As long as every human is somehow immune to advertising and to the expert manipulation of your senses that food manufacturers have been honing for decades to make people want to buy an excess of products every single day.Wansink is professor of marketing. As such hes ideally suited to study the effects of marketing on people which I find good and his coauthor is a specialist of nutrition. So perhaps they are not subject to industry influence that much. Wansink however does have a very strong neoliberal approach to obesity reduction and outlines the fact that in his opinion changes have to be profitable for industry to market things to consumers that will not increase their weight. Here it is explained in detail This article also states he advises big industry leaders. So I think he seems to have a high stake in their sales...I personally think that he is contradicting himself in saying consumers are rational and they also can be tricked into eating less. If they can be tricked into eating less then obviously they can also be tricked into eating more and its willful blindness at least to not recognize that brands are doing exactly that.,fatlogic,cwqr5kx,9,t5_2wyxm

How many kids would keep bothering doing homework? How many kids would even try? At lbs weighing lb seemed impossible. But getting down to lb my initial goal felt much more doable. And on the plus side lb is much easier to strive for once you are down to . Giving people more realistic goals increases the chances of them achieving something rather than nothing.And no Hollywood doesnt have to do anything. I never said they were ethically responsible for doing anything. They can do whatever the fuck they want with their piles of money.Im just saying it would be a good thing if Hollywood showed a more diversified range of healthy weight bodies.

Instead of just letting your breathing or circulation or brain function fail because there arent enough calories to keep it running which would kill you immediately your body chooses to do things that are potentially harmful but dont kill you immediately in order to provide the calories necessary for your basic functions not a conscious choice of course but a genetically predetermined choice honed through natural selection.  Your body begins to do things like cannibalizing essential muscles because yes eating your heart to keep your heart beating will kill you but it might take a couple of days.  Who knows maybe youll find food in that little bit of extra time.  Even if your heart is permanently damaged if you live long enough to reproduce andor get your children into a situation where they can survive without you the adaptation is evolutionarily beneficial especially in an environment where calorie scarcity represents a severe recurring selection pressure.,fatlogic,cxbo4vd,6,t5_2wyxm

5775129,0,t1_cxcx3eb,You mean this nonsenseIf you want to go to semantics though I am hesitant to say the ribcage expands as a whole because it implies that the ribcage grows bigger in every direction which it does not.And what do you mean by falling on your sword? Its simply something Ive noticed on myself and other persons have as well and this was the answer usually given to us Fat can accumulate not only sub cute but everywhere like around your organs. Visceral fat if I remember correctly. This means that it also takes up space inside your ribcage and exerts force upon the organ and the surrounding cage. And that is the second reason I am hesitant to use expand as a word because it implies that its somehow the ribcage doing something to accommodate the fat. but the agent here is fat because thats the factor that is changing More visceral fat means more pressure and ultimately that can lead to your ribcage which is in part cartilaginous to be pushed outwards and upwards.Ive also seen more than one CT scan that shows how visceral fat effects this change like the one I linked and if you show me some evidence that this does not happen I am happy to reconsider my view. So far however youve done little more than mock me The image you linked doesnt have any context Is that the same person even? Secondly As I mentioned its from an angle that would not show what I am talking about either way because of the way the ribcage gets pushed not to the left and right of you but outwards in front of you. Thats why I asked you if you had another angle.In any case I fail to see how not giving in to mockery on your part is falling on my sword.edit The linked image isnt applicable apparently its abdominal.

If it were treated in the medical field like drug and alcohol addiction you would see a lot more psych and social support which I think is what is really lacking currently. There seems to be some seemingly political movement to move eating disorder beds usually anorexiabulimia nervosa only out of psych wards and into their own special ward but I feel that is very misguided and only reinforces the stigma of mental health into an us vs them. I think all eating disorders whether eating too little or too much really does need the mental health attention that drug and alcohol addicts receive and we really need to get over the whole stigma of mental health. It really is quite sad about how mental health is treated everywhere.

Morbidly obese people have been studied and getting them to focus on weight loss isnt effective at making them more healthy so these researchers have tried shifting the focus to getting them to think about improving their health without focussing on their size. And its effective as per this study and all the others I referenced in that one book which youre conveniently ignoring.You dont know how to use google scholar to find the full text of this study?

6013620,0,t1_cy7p15h,When I finally decided I was an athlete and just needed to start thinking and acting like one despite being weak and obese eating enough was an unexpected issue. There was an inspiring article on rfitness about how calorie restriction should be considered in terms of TDEE and not a fixed number in particular no more than . I was being active but recognized that activity needed good fuel. Body fat was fuel but only fuel and didnt provide what my body needed to build  maintain muscle or other critical functions for life. I lost  in  months   on a kCalday average diet doing little more exercise wise than walking at a modest pace for a few hours each day. I ended up with some problems with my feet along the way but good shoes heavy socks staying off paved roads soaking moisturizer and Aspirin got it under control.Anyway sometimes I would be tempted to exceed my  cut thinking I would reach my goal faster and even tried it a few times but I could tell I would be more sore and less energetic later. Wasnt worth it. Persistence was going to be the key. Also noticed that what I ate had a big impact on how I felt. I wasnt dieting but collected data and observed how what I put in to my body made a difference. Better habits were unavoidable in the process. Anyway reading that nearly made me cry. What are they imagining what goal do they think they are moving towards with this supposed unsafe healthy dieting their doctor is begging them to stop? What did it even look like and where did they think it would end? I am so grateful there is so much great information and community on Reddit.

6029307,0,t3_3y12um,I am glorifying this body that does not and has never got enough praise for its existenceThe mental gymnastics behind this statement are just insane. Like a lot of people on this sub Ive been fat amp sedentary and over the last  years Ive changed it. Ive gotten into cross country running and now strength training. Ive carefully tracked my weight activity levels and daily calorie consumption and feel qualified to say I understand the relationship between these variables.A morbidly obese body like hers is only possible with gross overeating and extremely low energy output over an extended period of time. There is no glorification in that and in my experience the conditions required to create that body are born through an entirely negative mental state. Depression anxiety poor self esteem are all possible factors amongst others. Anything else is denial. Nowadays Im very active and strength training has me eating roughly  calories a day to achieve the progress I want and despite the activity I find this amount of food very hard to eat. Id guess that this woman is probably eating something similar on a consistent basis while maintaining the activity level of a sedentary person. This is extremely hard to do and often would involve eating way past the feeling of being full. At this point youre eating for completely nonfunctional reasons  i.e to make yourself feel better for entertainment etc. There is no self respect here and aside from the obvious physical issues that are evident here Id wager that there are even bigger mental demons at play.,fatlogic,cy9ymez,19,t5_2wyxm

6098419,0,t1_cyiqqjn,I dont think were arguing different sides. I think its great that theyve found hard evidence linking certain genes to obesity. What Im saying is that when a scientist medical professional or otherwise informed person talks about a genetic link to obesity they arent talking about the same thing as when a typical layperson looking for an excuse does. For a delusional fat person genetics  not my fault that Im fat rather than I understand that being fat is a result of my choices but it is harder for me to make the right choices given my genetic makeup. Further when people say genetics they often point to their family being fat and use that as proof or trot out a series of medical conditions that have some form of weight gain as a symptom. I can guarantee you that none of these people got genetic screening to find out that their genes make them predisposed to weight gain.Genetics undoubtedly plays a role possibly a large role but most people dont understand that role. Heck most medical professionals dont understand that role. Were only just starting to identify what effect genetics has on obesity and there arent any standard tests to identify when a person is or is not predisposed to obesity. Therefore anyone who says any version of muh genetics is not basing their argument on any conclusive evidence and should not be taken seriously. Even if they happen to be right they have no real reason to believe that they are right except for the fact that they are fat. Genetics is important from a scientific and medical understanding and will prove to be important in the future when combating the obesity epidemic but right now the most important thing for the average person is still education about proper nutrition CICO the importance of exercise to overall health the health risks of obesity etc. Until theres something to be done with the information as well as a way to frame that information in a productive way giving people one more reason to believe that they are powerless to change themselves for the better is not a helpful exercise.,fatlogic,cyittcg,3,t5_2wyxm

Was that big as I kinda was kidding myself that the amount I ate was countered by the exercise I did which it clearly wasnt. Difference is I resolved to do something about it. Looked up advice got MFP on the go. Set myself a target of kg. Hit that a few months ago. Got a muscle up a few months ago. Got down to .kg before Christmas am around kg nownot sure exactly scales said  a week ago so I dont know if I got some serious water weight over christmas thats just falling off me now. Im fitter than Ive ever been. I think I look good. Whereas this other guy is kidding himself. I might have sympathy if he was very fit despite that weight but those numbers he posted are really not remotely impressive and in no way justify being naturally heavy. If there is such a thing as naturally heavy and broad Id say Im in that category yet Im taller and lighter than him. And Im almost certain Im stronger with more muscle mass.

That was the lowest dose in the second study to be significantly shown to cause cancer. On the basis of concentration assuming that a human has an approximate massmass ratio of consumption with a mouse that would be the equivalent of me taking in about  GRAMS of Aspartame. A  oz ml serving of diet coke has mg of aspartame. So to get to that g number I would need to take in  servings thats  Liters about  gallons! every day from about  months old in the womb until I die to see a significant effect according to those studies. Now lets consider the alternative. Im going to come back to reality for this part. Lets say youre drinking  liters of Coke a day. Sounds like a lot but there are quite a few people out there doing this and the cartoon would be in that ballpark Id guess. Im going to ignore tooth rot calcium absorption brain receptor function etc for now Im just focusing on whats going to kill you first.  Liters of coke has nearly  Calories and  of that comes from Sugar.Thats  grams per typical can american oz ml can. Thats  Grams of sugar a day.  Im going to make the assumption that a person drinking this much coke is not watching their diet but is otherwise eating an appropriate amount in other words if their BMRactivity is  Calday theyre eating  Calday but drinking this much coke. I think this a significant underestimate to what is reality. Lets take that person BMR of  which is pretty generous. I use that number because its about what I use and that makes calculating the end weight and BMI much simpler. Im a  white male currently lbs kg and working my way down. Lets see what weight Id end up at if I drank that much Cola. That diet would put me a shade over  lbs kg. Thats a BMI of . Which do you think is more dangerous?

First of all  theres a business section you can buy into on most airlines if youre worried your negligent lifestyle has finally produced tangible consequences. It costs more until you have status and can upgrade for free but the excess food you shovel down costs more as well so you should be used to it. Second  there are WAY MORE OBESE PEOPLE than  people riding planes. I accept that my knees dont fit comfortably because I know Im some standard deviation above the average height of a passenger. Even if I didnt accept this I cant do anything about my height like you can do for your weight you can even have a surgery to lose your size immediately if you choose to be so lazy! AND my knees dont billow out into the people next to me like your excess rolls. Equating tall people to fat people as if were the same nuisance on planes is so fucking disingenuous. Three  you claiming to have never used an armrest on a flight is fucking ridiculous. Your fat laying over an armrest is using it.

It is not something to be glamourized and fat activists are going against their feminist roots by insisting they be considered attractive. Limiting your success to being able to score a hot man and being beautiful contradicts feminism in every way. I am one of those people who is in the camp that people should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies but at the same time it is irresponsible to tell others to pick up toxic habits that could kill them. It is also bullshit to expect everyone to agree that you are beautiful and by treating your body like shit you are opening yourself to criticism.

Meaning that when you arent actively practicing WW you dont know how the hell to eat. WW doesnt teach you that. Which leads to regain you come back you lose it you feel satisfied you go off WW you regain etc. The FAers are not at all wrong about that being their business model. Thats how business models work.

However no one should ever be hungry if they have taken in their TDEE. So even if you have a slow metabolism you still have to overeat to gain weight. And of course these metabolic differences can almost entirely be explained by height as well as build e.g. BF. So yes some people need to eat very different amounts. As someone on the shorter slower end of the metabolism range I can guarantee that if I only ate when hungry I would actually be eating less than my TDEE for my goal weight meaning that right now I am overeating.

Im sure its because in my mind since there was no guideline for calories the food requirement screamed eat as often as you want just try to not eat ice cream except on cheat days because dude that started BFL eats a whole fucking pizza and a tub of icecream he says so in the book! so I had no concept that what I was really trying to do was to eat fewer calories than I burned.

6454657,0,t1_czmjseg,I want to take this opportunity to point out perhaps redundantly that conditions that inhibit weight gain are far more plausible than conditions that inhibit weight loss. Weight gain can be inhibited because your body is incapable of or inefficient at extracting nutrients from food or at using or storing them. Its a failure to use the resources that are available.On the other hand failure to lose weight in the presence of a continued caloric deficit implies the use of resources that are not available which is impossible. Medical conditions that make weight loss difficult generally do so by increasing appetite e.g. praderwilli syndrome inducing fatigue e.g. chronic fatigue syndrome or having a damaging effect on motivation e.g. clinical depression. In other words they make it difficult to maintain a caloric deficit.,fatlogic,czmycdz,4,t5_2wyxm

6472114,0,t1_czon1du,I like to stretch my food as much as possible. Ill have two eggs for breakfast and add liquid egg whites it adds a bunch of protein for about  extra calories. Or Ill do plain Greek yogurt siggis tastes the best in my opinion and add splenda or a spoonful of jam. Its less calories and less sugar than sweetenedflavored yogurts.I have a mega sweet tooth so lowcal desserts for me are a must. Halo Top ice cream has saved me here an entire pint is  calories.  calorie Fiber One bars also taste really good to me and if you throw them in the microwave right before eating they taste like the real thing.I drink about half a gallon to a gallon of water each day i mostly do this because my job is super boring so it guarantees that about every hour or so i can take a walk to the bathroom. But it does help with the diet as well. There are days when my stomach will start grumbling at me an hour or two before lunch and water tricks it into thinking its not quite as hungry.Ive mostly replaced white starches with veggies. I dont ban any foods but for the amount of pasta you can eat in a meal you can have quadruple that volume if you use veggie noodles. The slight difference in taste and texture make that worth it to me! Tonight Im having zucchini noodles chicken sausage and Sicilian sauce with regular linguine it would amount to about half a bowl with zoodles i could have a bix mixing bowl full!Diet sodassparkling waters. There are days when i still want something but have used up my calories and i love flavored sparkling waters here but Ill also drink a diet soda if needed. They give me the feeling of something tasty without the calories.I also do intermittent fasting. If i know i want a specific high calorie food later Ill just skip breakfast and lunch to save up for it. Ill drink a sparkling water throughout the day and the carbonation is enough to keep me satisfied until dinner. I also fast for religious reasons for  hour periods from both food and drink so the sparkling water feels like a treat when Im doing intermittent fasting.I replace mayo with something lighter for me its a wedge of laughing cow cheese. Theyre  calories per wedge plenty for spreading on sandwiches. I also try and keep any bread i eat to  calories per slice or less.I get a bunch of ideas from risplenty.

6551881,0,t1_czwf6dh,Curious.I will admit that I dont consider myself a feminist in fact I pretty much hate feminism as I see it. But I will admit that my perspective is somewhat limited and my experience with it comes from the perspective of a relatively young Norwegian.  So my experience with feminism is almost exclusively with the bad side because its the only real side we have left here.  Things like equal pay for equal work a years worth of maternity leave solid financial assistance to single mothers taking violence against women seriously. Hell we have free abortion up to  weeks  if you can pass a medical review board.  All of that are not things Im really capable of fathoming why anyone would have a problem with because I grew up with that its not even seriously debated anymore.  So for me its something of a what about us? question because from my perspective the situation has been skewed quite seriously the other way. To which Im always told that men have had an advantage for thousands of years and how dare I complain!  But Im not thousands of years old Im . So it all becomes really omplicated because from one point of view Im a feminist because I certainly want equal rights and responsibilities for all.  However my experience is that feminism is an attack and a way to gain unfair advantages not to create equality.  Im not sure where Im going with this anymore it all makes my head hurt.  Maybe my point is that there are large regional differences organisations differ and its all just really messy.At the very least nobody should be fat and people should be taking responsibility for their own bullshit and not try to blame it on everyone else or try to ride other people who might have a legitimate case in order to get special treatment.

Actually yoga pants long shirt kneehigh boots and a waterproof coat is basically the womens winter uniform in my corner of the rainy PNW. You see it on young women old women thin women fat women and at work. The vast majority look just fine not people of Walmart at all. While they look atrocious and sloppy on a lot of people yoga pants are actually flattering on many women even heavier ones. It all depends on body shapeproportion and appropriate shirt length.

I tend to eat really bad and a lot of crap chipscrispswhateveryouwant Im looking at you but I always end up losing weight. In the last time in a week and a half I lost . kg . pounds for exemple and I thought that because of the food that I was eating and because of the contente of the food sodium for exemple which can cause a gain of weight because of water weight I would end up gaining. Then I began to think and I noticed that my heart really increases its rhythm when I am nervous does that explain my weight loss or does it have little to zero impact? Or even without noticing I am just eating a lot less of the calories than I should be eating when Im nervous and thinking they are a lot because they are from crap food? I kept the weight loss and now in the second phase of the exams it happened again which is rather strange! What do you think it is?NOTE Im a  female  years old and  pounds  kg so . kg in a week and a half is a pretty big difference at least I think so maybe you guys have different opinions which I respect.

We dont really know how all of them are going to interact so I guess well see.  I would welcome the studies you mentioned.

The ingredients are gotten from the grocer for ...so nobody gets rich therefore there is no reason for people to lie about their experiences although they still might I supposeSo I didnt believe it at first but after reading a lot of testimonials couple hundred on message boards Im more open minded to the idea that certain organs can be somehow toned or otherwise invigorated.

Once they are over a size  you have to draft a completely new pattern and hope it looks ok because their shape is so completely different.

6810151,0,t3_490nro,At my heaviest lbs at . I was working this incredibly depressing job and surrounded by fat people. Eating felt like the only way to break up the stress especially for me because my mom was obese to the point that she could barely walk. I learned a lot of foodcomfort from her. Even now I start thinking of all the things I could binge on when Im having a tough time. Anyway that job was very sedentary. A lot of driving to hospitals and sitting in traffic and sitting with families hearing the saddest things you could ever imagine. So I would get a Starbucks bullshitchinno and add a croissant and then a candy bar and jelly beans out of the jar on my lb coworkers desk that sat right across from me. I also had a major marijuana habit. If I wasnt at work I was high and stuffing my face with sweets. It was Christmas one year and I was wide awake in bed feeling crushed literally crushed by the stress of this job. I was paralyzed by the thought of having to go back the next day. So I sent in a resignation email. No other job lined up. No plan. Just too terrified to keep that job. I thought I would find another job right away but nope. One month of frantic applications turned into two and I was feeling like I needed to justify my unemployed time with some other sort of achievement. So I downloaded My Fitness Pal and logged all of my calories and used a food scale. Then I got a Fitbit and started walking constantly.  steps per day then . Long walks where I listened to awesome podcasts. I stayed super disciplined foodwise.  calories per day I was weighing everything even iceberg lettuce. I really wasnt going hungry at all. I was almost  body fat when I started so I had that to burn up. Started taking barre and other cardio classes at my community cheap not for profit gym. I quit smoking pot. I went to welding school. Six months later I was down  lbs and had a new trade and a new job. I look great. I feel really good about myself. And even though Ive recently been diagnosed with arthritis I still have more energy and endurance than I ever had before. My eating is much more sane. Not perfect not ever. But it has rhyme and reason to it. I can read a food label. I can plan a meal. I can cook my ass off and make something beautiful and healthy and cheap. I was so privileged to be able to take  months off of life to work my fat ass off go to school  hours per week quit my drug habit and just hard reset my whole life. ,fatlogic,d0o879t,10,t5_2wyxm

Ok got it.  Oh wait does this only apply to fit people?  Because Im pretty sure that being obese ruins your fucking quality of life and often the quality of life of those around you. gt gt Weight loss is not the same thing as health.It can be. In fact if someone is morbidly obese medical science suggests that weight loss is indeed the same thing as health. gt Following a lowcalorie lowfat diet aided by calorie counting apps and macronutrientoptimizing calculators may result in weight loss but that weight loss may also lead to disruptions in thyroid and sex hormones that lead to infertility depression and other unhealthy outcomes. So now youre using literal starvation as an example to discourage people from losing weight?  The number of people starving in this country compared to those who actually need to reduce their weight is so infinitesimal that it scarcely needs to be discussed in the context of societal health.  Im so sick of SJWs like this acting like we need to be careful telling people to lose weight because it might kill . of the population who take it to an illogical extreme due to a mental disorder while ignoring the tens of thousands who die every year as the DIRECT RESULT of obesity. gt And none of this really touches on the mental health issues that can arise from the obsession and selfimposed oppression of selfquantification.

If that doesnt work take it up the ladder to the relevant Dean i.e. Dean of the College of Science or something like that.  Its probably a waste of time to go to the chancellor though it may be worth it.  If its a state school and you have no luck in the school itself write a letter to any localstate newspapers along with state legislators.  But this is really worth looking into.

Very high maintenance It took time and money to rabbit proof my living room by covering electrical cords with vinyl tubing etc. Anyone whos interested in a bunnybunnies should check out the sidebar at rrabbits and should check out www.rabbit.org. Theres going to be a deluge of abandoned rabbits showing up in shelters and foster networks in the next month in the United States because parents buy them for Easter then get rid of them. A lady in rrabbits just yesterday told me that she heard someone say they fed their rabbit rat poison because they were sick of it and didnt want to pay to have it put down. Some people let them free outside. Pet rabbits are a species native to Europe. They are not the same as the American Picas that most US natives think of and cant just join a warren outside. They get eaten typically less than a week after being set loose. Some people literally put the rabbit still in its cage out to the curb with the garbage. There was an Easter bunny found like that near Cleveland last year and another the year before. The one that was found the year before was left out like that in the rain. The parents teach their kids an important lesson about responsibility that way if you have something to be responsible for and you get sick of it mommy and daddy will kill it or get rid of it for you. I guess just as the end of my rant rabbits are higher maintenance pets than cats. Ditto for property damage my rabbit can cause more  in damage if I dont block everything off properly than a nondeclawed cat using the couch as a scratching post. Its a fact of life but I still love my little furball. end PSA,fatlogic,d16tqar,8,t5_2wyxm

7019544,0,t1_d1btuz1,gtWe must strive to be more than we are Lal. Even if we do not reach our ultimate goal the struggle yields its own rewards. Love that quote but what the author is referring to are people who dont understand the second half.  That its not about the ultimate goal that the struggle itself yields its rewards.Basically people who in a running context have set themselves a goal of training to finish a race in a certain amount of time.  Then they get there and they underperform.  So they get understandably frustrated and discouraged and that leads them to quit.In the weight loss scenario you see that as well.  You set good reasonable goals.  Then you reach a temporary plateau or you cheat on the calories a bit too much and gain some weight.  People get frustrated discouraged think they cant make their goals and they might as well not suffer.  Or even simpler than that youre aiming for a particular calorie target for the day you end up going over so you go well Ive already missed my goal today screw it its time for a  calorie dessert and a liter of soda this day is already lost.You can strive for perfection but you need to allow for the fact youre not perfect.  You need to be able to mentally think thats not the time I was aiming for in this race but its a lot better than the time I would have been able to get  months ago.  Let me see if theres anything I can do to improve my training and Ill get it next time.  You need to be able to think Ive gained a bit of weight this week but I lost a lot over the past months.  Still doing great.  Let me examine my choices see if I need to do anything differently and get back on track for next week.  And you need to think I went over my calorie allotment by  calories today but lets not make it even worse!  Ill stop here and do better tomorrow.Basically its about not being discouraged even in the face of positive progress.  Might not have been perfect but its still progress.,fatlogic,d1c0k1t,6,t5_2wyxm

7124422,0,t1_d1nxule,Exactly  Im biased because I recently received treatment for something that is definitely thought to be lifestyle related that turned out to be a complication of a preexisting hereditary condition. I had cholelithiasis  gall stones  common in obese people and usually caused by high fat diets.  Only I was on a vegan diet for  years prior  and enrolled in an eating disorder recovery program on a controlled high diet  months prior.  When I was diagnosed my GP was just as confused as I was because my diet was healthy portion size was my problem but I was obese so we figured I was just a time bomb and my veganism probably delayed the issue but didnt prevent it. After the gallbladder was removed  the real issue revealed itself ulcerated duodenum and chronic bile acid malabdorbtion Id likely had symptoms for  years  I was diagnosed with IBS at a young age due to mucus and bile leakage but had a normal colonoscopy  it was both attributed to genetics mother has IBS  and obesity  but of course a colonoscopy doesnt check the duodenum so my issues there were missed  I was diagnosed with IBS when in reality I had IBD. So now the gall stones made more sense  IBD increases the risk of developing gallstones. But is the IBD genetic  or lifestyle related?  Chrons and UC are undoubtedly genetic  but my ulceration is only in my duodenum I do have other autoimmune issues that Ive had since infancy psoriasis and lichen sclerosus  and endometriosis if you believe that to be autoimmune  no one knows  so it could be genetic. But theres no denying that obesity makes everything worse it can alter blood flow to an area  increase the inflammatory markers in the blood stream and lead to autoimmune issues such as balding and psoriasis. So were my gallbladder issues lifestyle or genetic?  Both. Eating a healthy diet and being a healthy weight might have saved me from needing it removed  but I would still have ulceration and other symptoms throughout my life that would need medical attention.  My obesity accelerated the damage meaning I required more drastic treatment. So you cant deny someone medical care because of lifestyle  because nothing in this world is truly only caused by lifestyle  not even Type  diabetes.  Most people do get T from lifestyle  but there are links between gestational diabetes and developing T later in life  gestational diabetes is genetically predisposed and while obesity puts you at higher risk  people of healthy weight with healthy diets do develop it.  If these people ended up with T diabetes  years later  can we be certain that its because their lifestyle changed  for the worst or is there actually a link between gestational diabetes and T diabetes. What about wounds in the obese?  Theyre slow to heal and at greater risk of infection.  If they develop an infection is that covered on the NHS because that happens sometimes when people have wounds  or is it not covered because this persons obesity put them at a higher risk? Imagine the private health insurance industry in a world like that. ,fatlogic,d1nyqc6,7,t5_2wyxm

She had a well put together presentation about how terrible her life is and how she had eating disorders in high school but as she talked more its clear that she still has an eating disorder and has no idea how to eat or lose weight properly. It was crafted to make her seem like a victim and never once mentioned her current eating habits.She spewed bullshit about pcos how she gained lb in  months because of it not because she eats too much that was never mentioned. How people didnt see her as human or were shocked when she gained lb in a couple weeks.Then she talked about how she lost lb in  months by exercising  times a day and eating  calories. This is actually really sad because shes so poorly educated that she really has no clue how to lose weight healthily. Then she was still fat so she gained it all back because she couldnt work out  times a day because whats the point if she cant have results immediately and its hard.Then to top it all off at the end she got mad at someone who mentioned the problems with obesity and health because its all a big lie. She hit every single marker of an FA in a  hour talk. Pcos fatshaming doctors who treat thin people with knee pain differently big pharma the patriarchy oppression. It was killer. Like the internet had taken huge fat and unhealthy human form right in front of my eyes.The worst part is my boyfriend drank the koolaide and I had to have a conversation with him about all of her lies and he got angry at me because I  didnt know her so I couldnt say anything. And when I told him pcos is best managed by maintaining healthy eating and excercise habits at a healthy weight he told me that she probably knows more about her disease than you do.

As a fairly active teenager I didnt really need to worry about caloriecounting to maintain my weight.Now Im an adult with a desk job.

Its not about dragging everyones life or experience down to the lowest common denominator. Its different from egalitarianism because there are specific challenges in the world that feminism seeks to deal with that are not relevant to men. But it is absolutely not about hating men wanting to put men down or make life hard for them. ,fatlogic,d2rdmj4,21,t5_2wyxm

7473575,0,t1_d2rf8q5,Maybe I can answer some of your questions but they might not be the answers you are looking for.I should first warn you that I give you this perspective as a nonamerican well Ive lived in the US for a total of  years of my adult life but Ive also lived in  other countries so my opinion will be based on my collective experience of all the places Ive been before.Feminism in the US is extremely politicized with a particular flavor of left. I should actually correct this it is not just in the US Ive seen this in most English speaking countries. It is as fervent in the US as Ive seen in  Canada and England. A type of empowerment is promoted that is not matched in other places Ive lived in. The empowerment through letting go and do nothing that causes discomfort. Specially in collegiate environments but not on research heavy ones there is this sense of nothing is my fault the world is to blame that is simply not acceptable in other places.I cant explain why but it seems like a lot of stems from how a lot of current actions do not reap immediate consequences. For instance you can go through college with a student loan for years before you actually see the consequences of that debt and what it means to have to deal with it. In other countries for you to go to college you are either basking in the trophy of the money you already earned or being thankful for the hard earned money of all the relatives that chipped in for you. Service industry which employs so many students in college is not available as a part time in many countries because it is a career in itself which requires full employment.Classes like gender studies are extremely different from what is available in the  US. The focus is on achievements quite more from a historical perspective than the pain the got to get to those achievements which leads to perceived rage towards a gender while the other gender has no real guilt on those issues because they are past and most probably did not engage in activities with the sole goal of repressing a whole gender.To add to this the average sjw that I have met have an extremely poor understanding on science. I assume it is a product of the educational structure of these countries but I had students vehemently denying that estrogen has an effect on the muscles and that for instance knee ligament issues only become disproportionally across genders with puberty because of the effect of hormones. I just see a huge confusion between what are social effects and what are biological ones. And how much as humans we socialize biological aspects. This leads to a lot of issues being under the umbrella of feminism because they happen to people and some of these people are women and not the truthful this happens to these people because they are women.Ill be honest I dont teach so much anymore because at some point my open lectures became trolling ground since they were directed to underprivileged groups and they were focused on reproduction it was a shit show.So no fatlogic is not a feminist issue.Fat happens to people and some of those people are women. Fat does not happen to these people because they are women.Lack of scientific education happens to both genders.Edit also please keep in mind that feminism exists outside of English speaking countries and in a lot of them HAES is not acceptable at all.,fatlogic,d2rp93f,3,t5_2wyxm

Step into the life of a woman who gets zero attention from anyone and who repulses physically any male she comes into contact with amp then make a decision how important being desired by others is.It is the simplest thing in the world for an attractive woman to say what you have amp it is I suspect also quite heart breaking for a woman that while being a really decent person looks to have just crawled out of Shreks moat to hear because she would kill for even th of the attention you take for granted.,fatlogic,d2uacjk,1,t5_2wyxm

I was trying my best to reply with the occasional uh huh... oh yes dear etc. all while fighting with all my will power to keep myself together clinching the steering wheel with all my might under the sheer terror of possibly crashing and killing the most important person in my life. Thankfully after a minute or so the palpitation stopped and I slowly started to gain back control of the vehicle. I could have sworn the car was swaying slightly but maybe it was just in my head.

Its hard at first because like someone else said your brain is a screaming tantruming toddler when its going through sugar withdrawal. Once you pass that though you can actually feel physical hunger pangsrumbling as hunger rather than that phantom brain signal yelling FEED ME SUGAR! Its hard the first couple weeks but some short term willpower results in long term gain. Dont get me wrong  I had ice cream last night. But once you stop eating sugar all the time it really does just become a sometimes treat that you can easily eat in moderation.

When you want to eat them just pull one out unwrap from the wax paper wrap in a wet paper towel and microwave for  minutes or  depending on your microwave.

7666815,0,t1_d3dny4g,They did studies on different diets on isocaloric intake in controlled environnment so people couldnt cheat or misresport. What they found not surprisingly is that theres no difference between  calories of lowcarb food  calories of highcarb food  calories of zonefood and so on.But claiming that certain food might cause certain people to overeat its not wrong. And from the studies of Henry G Seale on how certain people have hyperinsulinemia causing them to develop low blood sugar in the same way a diabetic person taking too much insulin would and how low blood sugar causes among other things uncontrollable hunger... we know people like that exists.Notice thought that nothing about Seale theory implies magical calories disappearing or appearing out of thin air.Because honestly Im strongly against the fatlogic of Im not fat because I overeat its another cause I cant control but Im all for supporting overweight obese people who aknowledge their overeating but also claim they cant control their hunger because Im sure for some or many the inability to control their hunger is the real issue and can be psychological but also physical insulin resistance hyperinsulinism but also hypothyroidism and other health conditions are known to cause excessive hunger.,fatlogic,d3do8k1,3,t5_2wyxm

At  minutes a treatment I just have to endure  minutes or  hours and  minutes of this stuff in order to hit my goal weight. Forget months of carefully planned diets and hours spent at the gym.

7714070,0,t1_d3izdxy,Lmk if this makes sense in your case or not if not Ill ask a few more Qs but hopefully this answer helps others who are in this boat I suspect that what youre describing as stress eating is actually escapist eating. What I mean by that is that many people find themselves reaching for a snack at work in an attempt to trade off a bit of pain for pleasure. Its pretty much the equivalent of going out for a cigarette break.If this is the case Id attack this in two ways.... The first thing youll have to do is eliminate hunger as best as possible so that you can isolate the other triggers causing you to stress eat. The approach Im very much a fan of is the leangainsIntermittent Fastingbig meals approach would write out more details on this but in the interest of time probably best to google for the simplest guide. That is you have  large meals in the day within an  hour windowwithout snacking. This isnt necessarily a meal pattern for everyone for life but I make it mandatory for new clients and found that they build a newfound resilience to hunger throughout the day.. By now youve probably built a habit around stress eating which means that theres some sort of trigger. Perhaps hunger is the trigger Ill address that in the next point or perhaps its when your work gets to a certain level. Make sure to combine this with a high amount of protein...at a minimum you should be eating g of protein per lb of lbm lean body mass.. After an adjustment period youll have a better idea of the trigger causing you to snack if it doesnt go away all by itself. Perhaps its at pm when you hit a lull or its when work piles up. Youll need to find a replacement habit when this comes along. e.g. go for a walk play a mindless game on your computer text your spousegirlfriendetc or pop some sugar free gum as sciuridae mentioned.Hope that helps! Wish I could elaborate a bit more on leangainsIntermittent Fasting but need to get to other Qs. Ill circle back later if you have any Qs and my fingers havent fallen off yet.

7802287,0,t1_d3sx9n3,I ran a  on Sunday.  Thats an mile average.  I tanked during the last three miles though.  I was running with my cousin for the first portion of the race and she averaged just under minmile at the end.  I started to lose her about mile  and trailed off from there. Mile  and beyond was essentially me thinking dont walk and embarrass yourself in front of this crowd. Keep going.Heres an article about the average road racers time in various race lengths.  Not specifically first timers but itll give you an idea of what to expect.  For reference Im a yo male.  My time put me in th place out of  runners at my race.  Goal was  with a safety net goal of  hours.I dont really know what the right method is for training but Ill tell you what seems to work for me.  This is my th running event in the last year so my training might differ from someone who is starting from scratch if you are given that I was already conditioned for an k distance.  My maintenance training was three days a week k . or . miles k repeat.  For training in the few weeks leading up to the half Id go out  days a week and switch between distances like before but this time with  k . mile k ish mile repeat.  I had not run longer than  miles before my half. My running app on my phone isnt perfect on pacedistance but times for these runs are approximatelymin k min .mi miFor a prediction go here and put in your current pace or where you think youll be by October.  This worked pretty well for me for a prediction.  My last k was a  on a relatively hilly course.  That tool predicted a  for my half based on that time.  I know Ive gotten slightly faster since my last race so its basically bang on where it needs to be.  I wish Id done at least one practice half as training beforehand. I feel like I wouldnt have had so much trouble in the last three miles if Id had some experience with it. Related advice  Make sure youre eating right and enough during your training.  I tried mixing some weight loss in with running these distances and it didnt go well.  Food restriction leads to being weak which leads to sloppy foot placement which leads to injury.   I sprained my ankle two years ago and I couldnt run for a month.  Push hard but dont do anything stupid.Good luck!,fatlogic,d3t1dc6,3,t5_2wyxm

7850089,1,t3_4mtkz3,There are a lot of people in here who seem maybe overly hasty to condemn the fat friend and to break off the whole friendship over this.People have to figure out their own relationships of course and we dont have a lot of information on what this friendship looks like but this actually seems like a pretty significant moment in their friendship. The fat friend is being honest for the first time in a long time about her feelings and while OP is fair to feel upset or betrayed perhaps to the point where she ends the friendship theres such an amazing opportunity here to really deepen the relationship and maybe even motivate the fat friend to make some changes in her life! That is if both parties want that.People are just people and that means sometimes they feel shitty emotions and do shitty things to people they love. And then they hide those motivations and actions sometimes even from themselves. To have such a negative thing surface especially in the context of a longterm friendship is ripe for exploration and growth. Maybe the fat friend is motivated by fear that shell lose her friend. Maybe shes motivated by fear that she cant accomplish the same weight loss. Maybe shes driven by more subtle or more profound emotional challenges that arent obvious even to the thin friend. Being able just to air those feelings safely is often a major major milestone for people who seek counseling and a point that can take a very long time to reach. I dont know that Im there with almost any of my friends despite a fair amount of experience getting there with clients.I guess my point is that this might well be a toxic friendship that needs to end ASAP.

Certain addiction theories never made sense to me because they assume that I will always drink whatever when I have proven otherwise to myself time and again.  Im applying this to my weightloss. Last night I noticed I was talking myself into going to the gym which would have somehow also involved picking up takeout and booze on my way home. Instead I stayed home and cooked  where I have none of my favourite snacks and no high calorie preprepped meals or anything. The result is that I stayed sober AND on my caloric goals for the day.

7941028,0,t1_d47ensq,Obesity and salt are two things that raise your blood pressure to unhealthy levels. As far as CICO is concerned if just diet to get down to a weight and then resume your old eating habits you will go back to your old weight. So you have to make a permanent lifestyle change regarding total calorie intake which likely entails a permanent change to fat and sugar intake.With salt if you have high blood pressure even if primarily from obesity you may have to reduce salt intake to keep a healthy blood pressure. But if you lower your weight into the healthy range you might find that your blood pressure is low or normal even if eating a lot of salt. So you potentially have that to look forward to and can keep the temporary diet mindset regarding salt.If your doctor said to lower salt intake follow that advice. Dont read online that salt doesnt cause weight gain and conclude that you dont need to follow the doctors advice for managing weight caused high blood pressure. This is important follow professional advice!,fatlogic,d48n93k,2,t5_2wyxm

So that works out to a BMI of  with a VERY LEAN but healthy fat mass of around . Some runway models still get plenty of work with BMIs in the s and that aint cool.  They MIGHT be healthy in the s but the evidence starts going toward no.  The percentage of male not high fashion but other kinds models on gear is pretty sad too. Gear isnt good for you. It doesnt always carry a high risk of death but juicing related deaths are still waaaaaay more common than anorexiarelated deaths. But somehow chemically enhanced bodies are something we dont care about but thin models are an enormous problem????I was really curious and found statistical deviations to get my figure for the thinnest you can be while still having a perfectly normal and presumably healthy level of muscle. Just one standard deviation out from the average for normal weight slim young women. So theres a decent cushion built into that.,fatlogic,d4ekcf6,2,t5_2wyxm

It really compounds fears about aging getting sick etc. I think most heightweight proportionate women come to this realization much sooner in our teens the difference in how you are treated when you dress a certain way or your hair is styled. Even a thin woman can easily become invisible to men especially if she isnt facial attractive. Glasses a ponytail and some sweats is all it takes to lose the thin privilege she was attributing entirely to size. Its not like not knowing the nature of male love is a privilege we have we just accept it during our developmental years. That being said her argument with her husband and other statements i had to lose weight to get what i want seems to indicate that she plans on getting fat again now that she got married. ,fatlogic,d4gpyb5,8,t5_2wyxm

Then when you see a normal weight woman who looks just fine to you and me she just seems to have no curves at all because theres nowhere near the same level of exaggeration going on. So they compare them to boys both because boys also dont have the cuuuurves obviously and because referring to someone as a child of the opposite gender is always a mature and insightful insult that shows youre totally fucking clever. ,fatlogic,d4kf531,15,t5_2wyxm

Your idea of eat constantly is guaranteed to be very very different to my idea of eat constantly back when I was nearly  lbs. You work a fairly active job and you dont have a large appetite and dont eat nearly a much as you think you do. That is why you do not gain weight. If you took in as many calories as a   lb female you would gain  lbs quite quickly.If you really would like to gain  lbs the good news is that this is absolutely possible for you I promise. Why not ask about it in one of our weekly wellness threads or you could also post in rgainit.You will find that a lot of your current ideas about weight gainloss are pretty flawed but if you stick around and absorb what we know is true from countless studies and personal experiences youll find you have a lot more power over your own body than you think you do.

8249078,0,t1_d58n8ly,I wasnt saying people dont have an hour or two to devote to exercise. You dont have to walk around a city to do that. All I said was that most people dont have time to go to three stores on their way home even in a car when they have kids waiting for them at the end of the day. That wasnt about obesity or fatlogic. Just the idea that shopping once a week like Americans instead of Everyday like Europeans is baffling. Its not baffling. Its time management. You can work out anywhere youre at and any time of day. Like when your kids are sleeping. Or walking around your neighborhood after dinner with your kids.You cant actually just go walk to grocery stores in America a lot of the time. I was once in the situation when I had no choice. I was lucky enough to live in a small town so my nearest grocery store was only an hour walk from my house as well as it also was a walkable path. But like I said in my first comment thats just not reality.If I were to walk to my grocery store now in theory if it didnt actually require walking down a highway and crossing an interstate on and off ramp it is interestingly also just an hour to get there. Which would make a forty minute thing for me take more than two hours. And someone would have to take the kids for me.Edit There is actually a whole thread about this in askreddit on the question about Americans what about America makes sense with context? I cant link it though. The gist is that most people dont realise just how big America is and how far away everything is.You seem to really hate tv. Im not fan of it myself but not because of what it is. More that I just dont like much of what they make for it. I like plots in movies better. I dont like how tv shows have to drag stories out so long. I prefer reading probably because Im a writer so it just falls into place. But I fail to see the difference between Reddit and tv. Personally I think the internet is the national past time for Americans not tv. This why cable companies have been freaking out recently because they are losing subscribers like crazy. TV is not worth what they charge. We have an antenna so the kids watch PBS. And thats about it.,fatlogic,d58ovep,1,t5_2wyxm

Thats why a lot of surgeons will refuse to perform skin reduction surgery or lipo until you have maintained weight loss for at least a year. Fat cells only divide in adults once the cells are about x larger than they last divided. Its quite dangerous to regain weight after such a procedure because your body cant store the fat where it used to so whatever fat cells are still around will be the cells that store the new fat. This can lead to some really odd fat distribution on your body and cause lots of strain on the bones supporting the leftover fat cells.,fatlogic,d5gur3w,15,t5_2wyxm

8398224,0,t3_4uo21l,This poor logic drives me up a wall. gtWhat is all this talk about healthy because it look like she lost weight. Just because someone is overweight or not the size society says we should be doesnt mean they arent healthy. Many thin people have issues that go along with it... bulimia anorexia.  You call that healthy?!?Not everyone that never brush their teeth get cavities. Many people that brush twice per day still get cavities. Thats what this sounds like to me. You increase your risk for health problems at a weight over normal. Skinny people get sick. Fat people on average are sicker. Now MANY thin people have eating disorders?  Its not a tiny percentage? Where do people come up with this? Do they see a normal weight person and assume they obsess over restricting calories and food groups? They couldnt just practice self control every day and not overindulge at every meal. Overweight means you weigh than you should.  Your bodys optimal performance is achieved at a normal weight. These are medical terms. Thats why they are connected with health. ,fatlogic,d5rbp2q,142,t5_2wyxm

8439832,0,t1_d5w2fgh,OK going into maintenance  Heres whats worked for me your mileage of course may vary and take it for what its worth....I establish a weight range where I dont worry about the daily fluctuations. For me it was living in the s as my endweight at that time was lbs. Then I established an EEK! weight. Any time I hit lbs it was time to sort it out. Then I weighed every day and did a moving average. This will let you see the trend over time and lets you minimize the daily fluctuations. I weighed daily for  days wrote them down divided by . That was my weight that week. On day  I weighed. I added the last  days of weight together and divided by  so day  was now not counted. The next day day  I weighed added the last  days together divided by  and graphed it day  and  not counted now. Repeat and graph. Youll see the trend. So it worked like this  weight fluctuates all is good. Weight bumps up after Chinese food no problem as the moving average shows that this isnt a big deal. Any time weight gets over  libs eeeek I pay attention. Moving average shows a steady climb. I take action. Moving average is a little bumpy up and down Im doing OK.  Again just what I do lb maintenance going on  years with some bumps up and down along the way but from my POV its not big deal I just get on with it.,fatlogic,d5wink0,7,t5_2wyxm

8551241,0,t3_4wwlxk,So I just graduated college and have been working as a pet sitterdog walker to earn some money before grad school starts next month. One woman whose cats I sometimes care for is absolutely insane with the way she over feeds these two cats.For one the cats are restricted to the small dark upper floor of her house. Why she doesnt let them just run around the whole house I dont know. She hires me to feed her cats THREE TIMES A DAY. This means keep their huge bowl of dry food full and feed them three cans of food a day EACH. This means the two cats go through  cans of wet food a DAY plus constant access to dry food. The cats are morbidly obese they look like swollen ticks and can barely move. One has a skin disease that caused it to lose all its fur on its belly which Im sure was exacerbated with the weight. She is almost neurotic about it. She even hires another sitter to come simultaneously when she leaves overnight and instructed me that even if they hadnt finished their food from the last time they were fed to just feed them again and throw out the old food. One time I told her I didnt feed them one evening because I got there literally as the other sitter was leaving and she had just fed them and she told me that in the future I should just feed them again. Her elderly father who lives there has also been instructed to feed them. This means that some days these cats get fed up to six cans of food EACH. They also have bags of cat treats all over the house. Her neurosesparanoia is killing these cats and giving them a terrible quality of life yet shes impossible to get through to. The ironic thing is shes not even overweight herself. Its like the cats are her babies and she doesnt know how to show her love to them without feeding them ridiculous amounts. Sigh.

Art models are not all Olympian gods chiseled out of marble  a lot of them are completely average and schlubby people with hairy assholes and saggy ballstits. The excuse that scientific drawings dont teach me this thing I can see with my eyes is just laughable. That would be like whining someones arm was blocking your view of their wang during a pose so youll never be able to figure out how to draw one. I guess people never sketch on public transportation in coffee shops their friends whatever. Nope art is full of skinny  year old swimwear models and Dwayne Johnsons because thats the only people that exist and model.Also guess what  those lbs blocking your view IS THE VIEW. Body fat distribution cellulite the effects of gravity and age skin conditions you name it all of these are part of the human body and condition both fat and thin. Then again this shit excuse kind of explains why almost every dude in my old art classes could only draw helium filled tits with nipples pointing at the sky regardless of what model was in for us that day. I guess reality just doesnt fit in with their view. And I just want to note I make a living drawing people and doing concepts for actual studios.

8568865,0,t3_4s83k4,Why is it that no one here understands how calories are burned through metabolism? It is true that eating smaller meals through out the days helps burning of fat by utilizing a period in the metabolic cycle where the body starts burning fat instead of simple sugars. Starving yourself puts your metabolic system into a crisis mode your body thinks you are in a situation where you cant find food. It conserves energy by using the least amount of calories possible and any food you consume during this mode is immediately converted to fat. So according to science the claim on the video is true. It also assumes that the person is eating a smart diet of no more than  calories a day and the diet is balanced so people who bing eat  calories a day will gain weight no matter how they space it out.,fatlogic,d6cot46,1,t5_2wyxm

I cant just give him less food without his brother destroying the whole house...Sorry about the length you just hit a sore point for me and I kinda needed to rantask for helpDylan Fat cats brother Fat Cat is called Dante was given to me as a tiny kitten I was told he was  weeks old and weaned but they lied to me. He was around  weeks old and not ready to leave his mother. We were giving him kitten food but after  days he hadnt grown at all we weighed him and he was exactly the same. His sister had doubled in size during the same  days so we took him to the vet.Vet says Dylan cant digest the food were giving him effectively and hes basically starving to death and needs milk ASAP. One emergency trip to the supermarket later we have a very happy tiny kitten slurping up a bowl of lactose free milk. He soon started growing and is now a healthy  year old though hes still the smallest of my three.Those  days he spent starving to death kinda fucked his head up though he panics whenever there is no food around and if you eat in front of him he will go into a psychotic rage and try and take it from you by force. After months of dealing with a miniterrorist we took him back to the vet who said he had starvationsyndrome an issue where animals who felt starvation young in their lives have constant security issues about food. They suggested keeping a bowl of kibble around that is always available to him.Well it worked like a charm as soon as we started keeping kibble available his panic attacks and rages went away and he became the most docile little furball ever. He rarely even eats from the kibble bowl just checks on it every hour or so to make sure its still there then walks away again chriping.Dante Fat Cat DOES eat the kibble though and hes now lbs Dylan is only . and their sister is . He also has arthritis born with it so doesnt run around much. Ive no idea how to get his weight down without traumatising Dylan and turning him back into a psychotic clawed monster who would shred me for anything vaguely edible.Im stuck having to trade one cats physical health for the others mental health and its killing me.

I go to pick her up and shes obviously not .  She looks quite a bit younger.  She was .  She lied about her age because she wanted to meet older guys.  Her pictures on her profile were her but all angled and madeup to look older.  Her mom was there and everything and didnt mind sending her yearold off with some nondescript  year old guy which I found ridiculous.I took her out anyway because I didnt want to be rude.  Had coffee talked about music but she asked if I could possibly imagine anything romantic with her and I told her no because the age difference was just too much for me even though age of consent in my state would make it legal.  Its creepy and also I didnt want to deal with a yearolds social life or the fact that she still lives with her mom and goes to High School.

8745739,0,t1_d6yux6r,gt My links show that same amount of calories from different foods lead to different effects on weight. There are studies in my links that showed exactly that.Not in any mystical way. Surprise if your diet is lopsided then your digestion is a bit fucked.EDIT From the Wiki the Wake Forest citation links to an abcnews article so thats out.The Harvard study was selfreported so whatever.The Boston study only proves that eating a lopsided diet is a shitty idea. The phrase a calorie is not a calorie is misleading because it implies inaccuracy in either direction  when in fact even from cursory inspection of your sources and again the First Law you can only get fewer calories than you think. So once again not really an issue for weight loss. Dont eat a lopsided diet. gt Youre forgetting about entropy and energy loss involved in every step of extracting energy from something. Anyway would you care to provide links to research that prove you point? Youre not understanding what selfnormalizing means. Weve got models for how much the average human burns and weve got values for how much each food has. All you need is your intake and to track your weight. How much your body does or doesnt burn isnt important. Youre only gonna get significant variation if your body has a lot of trouble processing a certain food.gt Kneejerk reactions dont do you any good youre not trying to find out whats really going on youre just defending predetermined conclusion you agree with. Youre not open minded.No youre trying to unnecessarily complicate a simple concept and I dont like that.gt Great argument you have there.Yes it is because the statement you made is completely untrue. You do not understand the First Law at all if youre saying stupid shit like that. You can in fact completely ignore the complexity. A quantity of fuel only has so much energy in it. You cant perform work that exceeds that energy. gt When you build different machines which work with same fuel their their efficiency is unsurprisingly different.Humans are more or less the same damn engine. Engines with roughly the same components are go figure roughly the same efficiency. Outliers consist of super jacked people and people with serious medical conditions...but that doesnt matter for the vast majority.gt My point is that you arent even trying to question your beliefs. Reinforcing them doesnt make you a better person. Because youre attempting to obfuscate the concept of calories. Calories  work. If you want to talk about nutrition sure you need to consider exactly what youre eating. And sure when youre losing weight its a good idea to find foods that satiate you...but none of that changes what calories are or how they work. Calories are the metric for weight loss end of. You can try to sling uh ur not open minded and stuff but it doesnt changes the flaws in your argument. ,fatlogic,d6yvdbg,19,t5_2wyxm

I assumed I was sedentary for many years but it turns out I was easily burning upwards of k and often as much as k calories every single day. If I was sedentary it wouldve been under . It was after I started tracking these things that I realized just how easy it is to NOT actually be sedentary. All I was ever doing was walking around at school walking at work not driving to places less than a mile away... Even on the laziest of days I was easily walking kk steps which is damn respectable. If I wasnt putting forth any effort arthritis and random nerve pain kept me from wanting to move much at all what were ACTUAL sedentary people doing??Totally off topic but the one thing that actually led to me losing weight? Treating my OCD. Thats it. That was the key. The day everything clicked into place was the day I started losing weight. By the end of that week I lost  pounds water I know and never looked back.

8772660,0,t3_506yk6,This exact time last year I went to the doctor after extreme fatigue discomfort and other negative symptoms which I first associated with the worsening of my PCOS and after a lot of testing I was diagnosed with the beginnings of FLD. I was terrified.  year old and my liver was failing? Sure Id had a super stressful year and turned to booze and doughnuts after a hard day at my shitty job but no more than anyone else my age right? I spent a week or two in denial and then for the first time in a long time I stepped on the scale and looked in the mirror. I was ish and lbs.I spent another couple of months making excuses for myself. Telling myself it wasnt that bad that I hadnt done anything wrong that I couldnt do anything to fix it. PCOS stress money time you name it.Getting the puppy of my dreams and not having the energy to walk around the block with him without huffing and puffing and feeling dizzy weak and sick was the turning point. Its been eight months and Ive lost around lbs through diet and walking my dog the FLD is gone and the symptoms of my PCOS are lessening with every pound. I feel great in so many ways.It makes me really sad and really scared to think of the path I could have taken if Id let myself believe what this girl believes.

I dont know where it expects me to be balancing to give an accurate read so I have no idea if the middle of that range or closer to one of the extremes is more accurate. Its just a cheap scale I bought to get a better grasp of what my weight is doing between the weighins on a better scale I only have access to once every week or two but Im having a hard time sorting out the smaller fluctuations in weight with such a big margin of error.

It took too long for her to feel better and multiple Dr visits make her anxious so she just quit taking them. It just doesnt matter in her worldview.

I hate this notion that women cannot lose weight. Yes we typically have to eat less than our male significant other  guess what? My husband has  on me no kidding I cannot eat the same amount and not gain! Ive actually been more successful at keeping off the weight than my husband.

8944695,0,t1_d7mkl98,I cook tons of vegetables but its really easy to go overboard on the oils so heres something I learned that helps a lot take a plastic storage bag or a Tupperware with a lid and throw your veggies in there. Measure your oil and toss it in the bag with some seasonings close it up and shake it until the veggies are all evenly coated. Then dump everything on a baking sheet and roast it in the oven for however long youd like I usually do about  minutes longer if theyre frozen well honestly I dont even time it I just take them out when they start looking crispy on top. That way you dont have to drizzle a shit ton of oil on everything.  Broccoli halved red potatoes carrots and Brussels sprouts are all awesome this way.  Asparagus too but I prefer sauteing those in a skillet with some clarified butterOh and if you like spicy stuff do the same thing with cauliflower but replace the oil with some buffalo sauce D Just make sure to lightly spray your baking sheet first with a little bit of cooking oil spray.,fatlogic,d7n0qwr,1,t5_2wyxm

9040576,0,t1_d7x5frf,I weight around lbs at ft currently. I eat between  calories a day. I no longer track them but used to. I ate  steady for months and never gained weightwhich is what I wanted to do. I felt super bloated at first but after awhile got pretty used to it. Now sometimes my stomach will act up but its normally excess beans or something. This is eating a whole foods plant based diet high in fiber. The fiber is what gets me it makes you feel so full. Fat is easy to eat lots of calories of as are meat products. Because there is no fiber in those things they dont make you feel as full. You could go and drink  calories of canola oil but  calories of black beans is a lot of fucking beans. Try adjusting your macros to something like  fat  carbs and  protien or something similar. Those are the macros I found to work for me and what I read in a book by vegan ultra runner Scott jurek. He said he had to up the fat in his diet to  in order to eat the massive amounts of calories he needed. ,fatlogic,d7yj7mp,2,t5_2wyxm

Not to mention incredibly dull food and I had meat and dairy cravings worse than any craving Id ever had  the smell of cooked meat would actually have me drooling which was mortifying in public.Im all for people making their own decisions about diet and if veganism makes you happy thats great. But going vegan for me is not an option and it isnt for many people.Edit I understand you guys mean no offence but its not just that it was badly planned. I had a wide assortment of vegan foods was given supplements and all I paid  to have food prepared for me and supervised by a dietician outside of the hospital to make sure it was better  my body just wouldnt absorb it. It is possible to have all the best quality vegan food in the world and still not thrive just as it is possible to be completely wonderfully healthy on it. It didnt work for me thats all.

That theyre not happy  healthy and fabulous fatulous?.  Theyre miserable  sick and hate themselves for not being strong enough to fix the problems they make for themselves. If you spend your whole day quietly hating yourself  suddenly when someone points out constructive dissatisfaction with your performance  it triggers more self hate and FAs seem to then blame the other person for triggering the bad feelings that the self hate caused  instead of doing what normal people do and being able to separate emotions from things people have said which in this case should be water off a ducks back if you are confident with your size to emotions you feel towards yourself. ,fatlogic,d87z5uu,2,t5_2wyxm

9149767,0,t1_d8bsgjq,Exactly I didnt get offended when the powers that be decided the female version was a legbeard  I shower daily and take good care of myself but I dont shave my legs  I simply acknowledge that the insult is not aimed at me and I move on. Besides  we have other  nongendered  nonappearance based terms for people who are neckbeards  cheetogrubs and basement trolls spring to mind.  Though the first will probably offend FAs by mentioning junk food and the later probably implies they dont get out much. I mean if youre offended by being called a neckbeard  how about these FAs try not being a neckbeard.

9149783,0,t1_d8bse71,I feel the exact opposite. First of all I dont care if someone is fat and happy and they know perfectly well what theyre doing to their own body. If they acknowledge that their arteries are hardening and their liver is developing fat and their knees are weakening and their cells are mutating and they need to pay for two airplane seats and the way to fix it all is CICO but they still dont want to do it well its their funeral. Just like Im not gonna walk around and slap joints and cigs and bottles of alcohol out of peoples hands. Its all the same. They know what theyre doing. I also recognize that theyre still capable of making great contributions to society. I have some professors that are absolutely brilliant who probably have a ish BMI. Am I supposed to discount their contributions to society because theyre fat? Oh you cured diabetic neuropathy but youre fat so youre a worthless human being. Sorry.Second of all I feel like the one weakness this sub has had for years is refusing to acknowledge that women do face more pressure when it comes to looks. That link you posted literally has no fat logic. The author is thin and pretty and lives a healthy lifestyle because she knows she has to. She acknowledges the consequences of a bad diet. Ive heard SO MANY GUYS say stupid shit like I want a girl who can finish a steak and still have room for dessert or give me a girl who can hold her liquor and yet they expect this mythical girl to look like a ballerina. It is stupid. Im having trouble seeing what the fatlogic in that article is. There was another one you or someone else posted a few weeks ago about how women feel the need to justify themselves by saying I havent had anything to eat ALL DAY if they order anything other than a salad and its totally true! I dont have any overweightobese female friends except one who I cut out of my life but its true that all of my friends stay stuff like that when we eat out. Im glad this sub is finally starting to acknowledge that men are flawed too.And yeah no article would outright say that women are stupid because its implied in a million different ways. With every Make me a sandwich with every use of the word Kartrashians youre implying that women and their hobbies are inferior or more vapid. Why is it so commonplace for men to make fun of women watching KUWTK but any woman who makes fun of a man for watching sports is met with defensiveness?

Right now the extent of the nutritional education most children get is the MyPlate thing which is just the updated version of the food pyramid and almost zero information on how macronutrients or calories. The entire FDA Guidelines repeatedly go with that calorieperday thing even though thats far too high for many people to maintain on and really dont even reference calories all that much. Yes quality and type of food is very important for health but an overconsumption of good quality foods can still be incredibly unhealthy. If we taught our children about nutrients and CICO I think we could seriously reduce the obesity crisis affecting our country. ,fatlogic,d8ffq27,16,t5_2wyxm

9396761,0,t1_d973lhi,meal frequency weight lossAlthough the initial results of the present metaanalysis suggest a potential benefit of increased feeding frequencies for enhancing body composition these findings need to be interpreted with circumspection. The positive relationship between the number of meals consumed and improvements in body composition were largely attributed to the results of a single study calling into question the veracity of results. Moreover the small difference in magnitude of effect between frequencies suggests that any potential benefits if they exist at all have limited practical significance. Given that adherence is of primary concern with respect to nutritional prescription the number of daily meals consumed should come down to personal choice if ones goal is to improve body composition.The present review showed that DED was directly associated with risk of excess adiposity higher weight change and BMI. Lower DED should be considered as prevention strategy for obesityClearly obesity results from excessive energy intake that has sustained over a long period of time. Currently we do not understand why people consume more energy than they expend.We found significant variations among cost estimates in the existing literature. The metaanalysis found that the annual medical spending attributable to an obese individual was   in  USD accounting for . billion at the national level. The two most significant drivers of variability in the cost estimates were age groups and adjustment for obesityrelated comorbid conditions.A BMI in the th to th percentiles within the accepted normal range during adolescence was associated with increased cardiovascular and allcause mortality during  years of followup. Overweight and obesity were strongly associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in adulthood. Funded by the Environment and Health Fund.Using the trajectory approach we found that heavy body shape from age  up to  especially the increase in middle life was associated with higher mortality. In contrast people who maintained a stably lean body shape had the lowest mortality. These results indicate the importance of weight management across the lifespan.Overweight and obesity is associated with increased risk of all cause mortality and the nadir of the curve was observed at BMI  among never smokers  among healthy never smokers and  with longer durations of followup. This is a rather obvious distortion of the actual outcomes. On average these people maintained a  weight loss and  maintained at least a  weight loss. These outcomes compare favorably to the  who maintained a  weight loss after eight years in the Look AHEAD study. They just dont compare well with the Biggest Losers premise of weight loss miracles.  See more at Metabolic response to experimental overfeeding in lean and overweight healthy volunteers.All outcomes were consistent with theoretical changes due to the increased fatfree mass body weight and energy intake. There was no evidence of any active energydissipating mechanisms.Fat and carbohydrate overfeeding in humans different effects on energy storage.Carbohydrate overfeeding produced progressive increases in carbohydrate oxidation and total energy expenditure resulting in  of excess energy being stored. Alternatively fat overfeeding had minimal effects on fat oxidation and total energy expenditure leading to storage of  of excess energy. Excess dietary fat leads to greater fat accumulation than does excess dietary carbohydrate and the difference was greatest early in the overfeeding period.Effects of isoenergetic overfeeding of either carbohydrate or fat in young men. Thus fat storage during overfeeding of isoenergetic amounts of diets rich in carbohydrate or in fat was not significantly different and carbohydrates seemed to be converted to fat by both hepatic and extrahepatic lipogenesis.Low Carbohydrate versus Isoenergetic Balanced Diets for Reducing Weight and Cardiovascular Risk A Systematic Review and MetaAnalysisTrials show weight loss in the shortterm irrespective of whether the diet is low CHO or balanced. There is probably little or no difference in weight loss and changes in cardiovascular risk factors up to two years of followup when overweight and obese adults with or without type  diabetes are randomised to low CHO diets and isoenergetic balanced weight loss diets.Neuronal deletion of ghrelin receptor almost completely prevents dietinduced obesityHowever the current evidence does not support the hypothesis that obesity is sustained by lower daily EE or REE. Future studies comparing EE between obese and nonobese and assessing potential physiologic abnormalities in obese individuals should be able to better answer the question of whether these individuals have altered energy metabolism. The investigators followed over  overweight or obese people who joined Take Off Pounds Sensibly TOPS between  to . In the first year half of participants in the nonprofit weightloss support group had significant weight loss. Of the patients with significant weight loss in the first year who participated in a second year  kept off the weight. Each year during years three to seven roughly  of patients who continued participation in the program maintained their weight loss. Overweight people make unhealthier food choices than lean people when presented with real food even though both make similar selections when presented with hypothetical choices according to research led by the University of Cambridge and published today in the journal eNeuroIn a second study the researchers looked at the brain structure of over  healthy individuals using an MRI scanner and found an association between body mass index BMI and brain structure. Strikingly one of the regions showing this relationship overlapped with the region responding to food value in the first study  the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The grey matter layer in this region was thinner in people with greater BMI.Conclusions Findings suggest that many individuals with severe obesity meet criteria for MCI and that prevalence rates decline after bariatric surgery. A better understanding of the mechanisms linking severe obesity to adverse neurological outcomes is much needed.A study of almost   obese patients shows that those who do not have obesity surgery are much more likely to die from any cause than those who do have surgery after an average of  years followup. The study presented at this years European Obesity Summit is by Christina Persson Sahlgrenska Academy University of Gothenburg Sweden and colleagues.Obesity is associated with increased mortality in numerous diseases. Bariatric surgery has shown to prevent obesity related mortality and morbidity. However there is a lack of The authors conclude This populationbased cohort observational study indicates that the overall allcause mortality is considerably lower among obese individuals who undergo bariatric surgery compared to nonsurgical obese individuals and the differences lies mainly in cardiovascular disease and cancer. Individuals diagnosed with ADHD or obesity are more likely to choose smaller immediate rewards over larger future rewards.These new studies found a highly consistent reduction in capacity to delay gratification. Immediate reward orientation is robustly elevated in both ADHD and obesity. Overweight and obesity is associated with increased risk of all cause mortality and the nadir of the curve was observed at BMI  among never smokers  among healthy never smokers and  with longer durations of followup. The increased risk of mortality observed in underweight people could at least partly be caused by residual confounding from prediagnostic disease. Lack of exclusion of ever smokers people with prevalent and preclinical disease and early followup could bias the results towards a more U shaped association.,fatlogic,d973sz7,3,t5_2wyxm

It is far easier to bulk with some fat gain and then cut with some muscle loss rather than trying to do both things at the same time.

Anyways so Ive lost  pounds since August and my best friend and I were talking about weight loss. She tells me yeah I cant lose weight unless I exercise and I dont feel like exercising right now so ehhh Ill probably diet later. So I tell her that its totally possible to lose weight without working out as long as shes eating at a deficit she knows how it works already and she says I know that but it doesnt work on me unless I eat less than  calories a day AND exercise. Otherwise I dont lose weight. Even at less than  calories. I told her that really doesnt make sense shes probably underestimating calories in what she eats. She insisted that she has to basically starve if she wants to lose though so I just dropped the subject. Also on the  same day my mother was complaining that she couldnt lose her last ten pounds so I suggested that she try going just  calories lower and see what that does for the week.

Calling a slimfit woman an adolescent schoolboy is a way of desexualizing her denying her the status of female much less woman based solely on the appearance of her body. This shit goes handinhand with real women have curves men like meat dogs like bones and  all of the other stupid sayings fat women use to assert their own sexual desirability at slimfit womens expense. And all of it is grossly misogynistic because it panders to the idea that womens value is tied to having bodies men find sexually desirable.

9697449,0,t1_da8dj51,Triathlon can be cheap. For my first sprint I rode my mountain bike. I trained at a gym with a pool. No plan just spent as much time as I could swimming biking running and lifting weights. Day of race I put on a sports bra and under armour shorts from fred meyer. Got in the pool. Swam  laps in  minutes. The race provided a cap but I had to but one for training and goggles. Got out ran to transition. Put on a tee shirt and my running shoes. Got on my mountain bike i wore a cheap helmet from sports authority. Did the bike. Got off bike took off helmet ran k. Now Im drowning in race fees and travel cost. I bought a nicer bike. I have a trisuit. I train more and have to replace my training swim suits every six weeks or so. I have clipless pedals and I need new bike shoes because mine are really smelly and they dont match my bike. Bike fit was . My coach runs group training sessions which are fun but the cost adds up.  I bought a membership to a yogapilates place in an effort to cross train safely. I bought an indoor bike trainer. Then I needed a different bike computer to use indoors. I upgraded my watch.Ragen skipped the gradual accumulation of stuff and costs though. I did a sprint. Then I did the same sprint a year later. The next year I did two sprints. I upgraded my bike first by putting slick tires on my mountain bike. Then I tried an xterra sprint the next year. Last year I did an out of state olympic tri with my new bike and two sprints. Also got on the board for a local race. Ive been doing this for about the same amount of time as Ragen. I didnt include all of the medals Ive earned through participation in run only events or and bike races. I got a promotion and a few raises.

Id expect a simpler explanation  its reversebodybuilding cutting and bulking.  The person goes on a very low calorie diet and either doesnt exercise at all or just does tons of cardio.  So a fair amount of muscle is lost along with the fat leaving the person with a lower BMR and worse body composition than if theyd had a smaller deficit more protein and resistance training.  Skinnyfat extraordinaire.  Then when they stop the VLC diet the weight that gets added is even more fat relative to lean mass so when they are back to their original weight they have an even greater body fat  than before.

The definitions are similar and its sometimes okay to use the interchangeably and as synonyms but its not correct to do that in the medical field.Normal conforming to a standard usual typical or expected.So normal would be conforming to the standard BMIBFP that is considered healthy.

Its absolutely amazing because as it is people with disabilities who use it we know the importance of a clean seat. No hovering often hand difficulties with cleaning a dirty seat a need to shuffle yourself about on it...so we sit square on it and keep the damn thing clean.  The one and only time Ive been in a dirty disabled loo in the UK and Ive used a lot of them was in a train station where they often include a baby changing table. Right after a parent came out with their child I went in. Piss all over the seat bloody piss at that and the childs nappy left sitting under the sink. Fuck you disgusting mother in Manchester Piccadilly you are a skank. I know why you looked at your shoes and it wasnt because youd taken too long. Anyway. Dont piss up the seat or take the accessible loo if there are other options and youre fine. I say if there are other options because people with disabilities cant often hold it in the same way others can so if someone takes the handicap stall and takes their time while were waiting outside with five empty cubicles that gets old real fast.

Their food was awful they treated us hospitably to a big neighborhood barbecue and it was really awful to us...Culture shock is very large for some of us indeed.

10645517,0,t1_dddnpzk,This is what bothers me. I grew up pretty poor. Eating out was a legitimate luxury. It cost way too much to eat out when my mom could toss something together to eat. Going to TN as a kid to visit my grandparents for vacation was one of the few times wed get to eat out because my dad had to have Krystals when we got there.I dont understand this too poor to cook shit comes from. At all. My SO and I eat out more than Id like to admit now and compared to tossing together a quick dinner is massively different in price at the end of the week. We save so much eating at home. And too tired isnt a legitimate excuse when you can grab a frozen meal or some microwaveable shit which is still cheaper and healthier than fast food.Out of all the excuses for eating stupid shit and becoming obese from that choice this is the one that annoys me the most. Plus to eat the amount of calories a day to become the size of most of these people  they arent hitting the cheap menu. Theyre getting way too much in food. So the Im too poor to eat salad is bullshit. Or the worst Ive seen is the I cannot afford to eat the organic foods I would rather because I dont want chemicals on my food so I have to eat fast food really makes my blood boil.Just own up that you eat fast food because you like that shit. Id still think you need to change up and stop excusing obesity but Id respect you more for being honest af about it than pretending youre poor so you can excuse your shit lifestyle.,fatlogic,dde04p1,21,t5_2wyxm

People at the gym are too busy doing their own thing to really notice anyone else. The most they will probably think if they even notice youre there is hey good for that person and then go right back to what theyre doing and forget all about you. Second a lot of the machines have instructions on them. I find that helpful. You can also ask an employee for advice that is part of their job after all and most are happy to help. Ive done this many times. I like trying out a new machine every so often just to keep it interesting. Ive discovered that I really like the lat pull down machine for whatever reason and do not like the exercise bike at all. So just look around for something you might want to try and give it a go.

11144609,0,t3_5z4kue,gt Weighing human bodies is rarely medically necessaryMight actually be true. Because most healthy humans fall into a very predictable weight range and you can tell just by looking at a person if they are too fat or too thin.gt Weighing and weight talk in the medical context frequently lead to iatrogenic harm causing psychological distress andor disordered behaviours around food in patients as well as a breach of trust between doctor amp patient and patient amp body. And its especially damaging when the patient is a child.Youre crazy. And wrong. But thats beside the point because your problem is that you are crazy.frequently  I doesnt mean what you think it means. The vast vast majority of people on the planet are mentally stable enough to handle conversation about body weight.gt disordered behaviours around food in patientsLike pointless rants on the internet trying to convince yourself that your weight isnt a problem and your relationship with food is normal and healthy? Yeah no the cause of that is not that your doctor asked you to the scales ...gt as well as a breach of trust between doctor  amp patientDa fuq? No! Your doctor is not breaching your trust if they talk about you your life your habits your body or your medical history. Your doctor is doing THEIR JOB! The last tie I got a new doctor the first consultation was included do you drink or smoke? Do you work out? not sure if my weight was brought up but the last doctor before that did Itd be good if you could lose a couple of pounds I think it was.gt and patient amp body.Did I say you were insane yet? You are insane. Your body is not a separate entity from you and it most certainly isnt fucking concious on its own.gt you almost certainly dont have to be weighed at every doctors visit check with your insuranceproviderHow is that such a big revelation? First of all nobody is forcing you to see a doctor. And then it takes an awful lot of legal and medical procedure to force a person into treatment against their declared will.You know whats funny though Doctors rarely take my weight. But then I am neither anorexic nor morbidly obese. My weight doesnt require constant monitoring because it isnt an issue. I was overweight and possibly obese. Doctors could tell without weighing me. If doctors want to weigh you it is because your weight is a concern to them and they want to monitor development.gt and neither do your kidsFunny enough when I was little doctors would take my weight  and height  fairly often. To track if I was developing normally and to spot any deviation so theyd spot any issues early on I assume. But what do I know not being a doctor ...gt Say no.Or be a fucking adult and face reality. Oh wait I forgot ... youre insane.gt its worth getting weird looks from a nurse to avoid a practice that does more harm than good.Taking your weight is as passive external and noninvasive a medical procedure as youll ever be able to find. Thats why I have a set of scales in my home and get to use it without special training or certification. If your mental issues and hangups about weight are this severe then being weighed is not your biggest problem.And I do sympathize irrational aversions are annoying at best but that doesnt mean your worries are deserving of consideration nor are they worthy of being broadcast all over the internet.

I spent my teenage years overweight and sedentary. At uni I discovered I could control my weight with some exercise which I continued to do over the years but always reluctantly  I hated exercise even if I recognised its benefits on my body.In the last two years or so something clicked. I loved feeling strong and athletic. I found a focus a zone where I could push through the discomfort where I had real stamina where I stopped whining when it got tough. I was not only enjoying my workouts I was excelling at them. I signed up for a Tough Mudder half because it was something I always wanted to do but was too scared to try. My injuries started getting serious but I worked with a physio a personal trainer and got lots of massages to get me race ready. Race day was amazing. I felt so confident and positive and couldnt wait to sign up for the full one in a year.And now I cant do it. Its just a race. It will still be there if I allow my tendinitis to heal.

If you are within normal BMI already Id just approach it like this eat healthy check your total calorie intake a bit so that youre not going over what your body currently needs eliminate unnecessary foods that you are just eating for comfort or because youre bored watch your protein and vitamin intake and find some sportsexercise that you enjoy. Then maybe after a few weeks or months reevaluate the situation  have you lost gained or maintained your weight? Does your body look different have you lost or gained any inches around your torso or limbs lost or gained visible muscle? Do you like what you see with and without clothes on?

11239986,0,t3_60dmw4,I actually do think most people particularly women eat too few calories while trying to lose weight.  They either wnd up failing or skinny fat and look like they melted.  I think eating  calories when youre  pounds is a form of fat logic.  Its still a fat person trying to hack their body and get results faster.  Moderation isnt learned that way.  You cant get proper nutrients for a body that size at  calories.  You should try to keep your deficit at  if you really want to make a change.  Its slower but the results are more sustainable.  Its the healthy way to lose.Then again I think even many people here expect their weight loss to by cyclical.  They go on very low calorie diets but it only lasts until they feel better in their bodies.  Then the restriction is out the window and the binge begins.  That wasnt too hard they say and they plan to just go on a diet again.  If you lose weight right the whole point is to not deprive but instead to nourish.,fatlogic,df61b7x,4,t5_2wyxm

Background about me I used to be really fat then I lost lots of weight on Slimming World high carb low fat diet kind of similar to Weight Watchers. I was also doing circuit training at my gym  times a week. I picked up running and started running  times a week. I was quite good at it. Then I suffered a loss in my immediate family and I was not grieving properly and ended up putting on loads of weight and stopped going to the gym. I started losing weight in Feb this year by measuring out my protein starches and fats. I dont see the point in measuringlimiting vegetables really lettuce cucumbers peppers mushrooms etc.. not potatoes. I make sure I have at least  portions of vegetables every day. I also am trying to be more active and I use my FitBit to walk k steps a day. I do this by lightly jogging in place for an hour every day. Ive lost a lot of weight this way and managed to go down from Obese to Overweight. Im only kg away from getting in the Normal BMI range. Im hoping my circumstances can change and I am able to go to the gym but until now Im doing the best with the hand Im dealt with. This morning I had g oats cooked in water with cinnamon. Then I added  dried apricots on top. I also had a nectarine.That was my breakfast.I waited  hours then decided to go for a jogrun outside for a change. I went to a park and jogged for a bit then I power walked then I jogged..I was alternating between the two. This lasted for  mins. I drank plenty of water. Then I sat down on a bench and replied to all my texts and emails  mins then I went home.I hopped in the shower because I was stinky and gross. Then I went downstairs to the kitchen to prepare my meal and halfway through my cooking I felt very dizzy and lightheaded. I was sweating profusely all over my chest. I felt like I was going to be ill. I couldnt stay standing for any longer.My friend came in and she told me to take off my socks and to drink plenty of water. She said this happened because I showered straight after exercising I should have waited longer. I ate my food while chatting with her took about  minutes then went upstairs to my room. I was feeling much better. I stopped sweating and I wasnt dizzy or lightheaded anymore.Question Why was I dizzy and lightheaded and ill and couldnt stand on my legs? Was it because muh shugas were low? Do I have some sort of condishun? Was my friend right about the shower thing? Do I have to see my GP about this or is it normal?!

11336627,0,t1_dfgy34i,Well Im no expert but Ill happily share what I do.To warm up before I work out I do sun salutations. This is a simple yoga sequence with tons of variations. Bonus it gets you some very confused stares at the gym.The actual stretching part of my routine Stand with your feet together. Gently roll your head around to stretch your neck and shimmy your shoulders.The following should be done for at least thirty seconds each Reach your right hand over your right shoulder. Try to grab it around your back with your left. If they cant meet use a towel and try to walk your hands up towards each other. Repeat on other side. Try to touch your toes. Keep your knees straight. Sit on the floor. With flexed feet stretch towards your toes. If you cant touch your toes work on loosening up one hamstring at a time by bending one leg and stretching towards the opposite foot. Point your toes and repeat. Spread your legs as wide as you can with your toes pointing up. Dont rotate your legs just scissor straight open. Fold straight forward then over each leg to stretch your back. Sit in butterfly with the soles of your feet together. Work on bringing your heels as close to your crotch as possible then work on folding forward. Stand up. Spread your legs as wide as you comfortably can without losing your balance. Fold forward then down along each leg. While standing cross one foot over the other and stretch down to loosen your calves. Repeat on opposite side. Stretch your quads by standing on one foot and bending the opposite leg behind you while grasping the ankle. Its okay to hold onto something for balance.Important note when youre sitting on the floor trying to fold forward or reach towards your toes avoid hunching your back. The reach should be coming from your muscles stretching not from twisting or hunching your spine.An additional hipflexibility stretch thats easy to do throughout the day while sitting in a chair cross one leg over your knee. Fold forward and try to touch the floor. This is hard for most people but its great for your hips.I do some more advancedunnecessary stuff like splits but thats just me. I think the routine above covers the basics.edit formatting,fatlogic,dfgzjiw,6,t5_2wyxm

11338189,0,t1_dfh53pi,First of all try to relax and cut yourself some slack. Going through a rough time isnt going to reverse your progress. Dont add extra stress by being so hard on yourself. When Im feeling really stressed sometimes I let myself eat up to my maintenance calories for a couple days and Ive found that can really help because it allows me to maybe have a little extra chocolate or some sort of comfort food that I normally wouldnt eat. Although of course you shouldnt eat your feelings sometimes there is something therapeutic about making and eating your favorite meal or dessert. If youre feeling like you dont want to exercise try to just go on a short walk every day. Just  minutes outside breathing in the fresh air can do wonders for stress I think. And often it encourages me to do a little more. Maybe Ill feel like following it up with light stretching or even doing a super short and slow jog. Either way youll feel better. ,fatlogic,dfh5wxj,10,t5_2wyxm

11348715,0,t3_61yqp9,gtNot that being unhealthy is bad anyway Im disabledThis is one of the more callous and insensitive strawman arguments that FAs use. It has never been widely suggested that being unhealthy or disabled is bad because the person who is unhealthydisabled is a bad person of bad character or bad intentions. The part about being unhealthydisabled that is bad is that people who are unhealthydisabled are limited from their full human potential because of their condition and thus their quality of life is lower than it could be and that is bad. I think that most disabled people would choose to not have their disability if that was an option. FAs just exploit the sensitivity surrounding the subject of disabled peoples conditions and try to tack unhealthy on to them as if being actually disabled is a similar concept to consistently intentionally disabling yourself through gluttony and utter disregard for the normal maintenance that a human body requires. ,fatlogic,dfictt2,35,t5_2wyxm

And Im struggling a bit but Im starting to get better at telling myself that I need to cut a little more to see those abs that I can save dessert for another night etc. One of the coolest things was going for a run yesterday being as light as I am now and realizing that it is so much easier to run at a lower BMI than it is when you are on the higher range of a healthy BMI. Idk if you run at all or what you do for exercise but that helps a lot for me!

Obese people generally have poorer circulation than skinny people. Poor circulation can lead to wounds that wont heal. They also have a thick insulating layer of fat around all their incisions. Fat keeps things warm and moist leading to higher risk of infection. Surgeons dont want to operate on fat people because the outcome are significantly worse.

Ive been waiting all week for this day!!!So my friend whom I love dearly because he supported me so much through my recovery from a nasty car crash has finally decided to take charge in his diet. AND HE CAME TO ME FOR ADVICE! Im so proud of him. We talk about healthy eating and working out because its what we have in common outside of video games and movies. He is just barely into obese and about lbs form the upper limit of his ideal weight. Hes always been into running but in his own words Im fat because I love chocolate and food too much. He downloaded SparkPeople because I have talked to him about how it helps me with my weight loss. Im trying to teach him about moderation and being more mindful about how much hes eating. He expressed concern because he had a holiday dinner to go to and wouldnt count his calories for that I told him to just be careful how much hes eating aim for maybe a little overstuffed but not food coma. Hes a smart dude and he knows the reason he is fat is because he eats too much hes far from delusional about it. Im just very happy that hes starting to reconsider the extra plate of food or extra pieces of chocolate. I love this dude and I couldnt be more proud of him right now.Another friend of mine has recently decided to lose weight as well. Shes got a bit to lose but again shes not delusional about why shes fat and how to lose the weight. Shes not the type who would calorie count but she does know to eat less when trying to lose weight. Im going to help her start swapping her sodas and energy drinks for iced tea and water. Also shes expressed that she wants to quit smoking or at minimum significantly cut back. Yay!! Im thrilled because she wants to start doing some of my urban hikes I walk around town for a few hours with no aim on where Im going and stop at a shop if it looks interesting. I usually get  miles in. Shes also expressed interest in some hiking but at the moment everything has too many hills and we are going to work up to that.I love all my friends fat or thin.

If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing.If youre saying doggo family youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of Doggodaemous which includes things from sub woofers to birdos to sharkos the glub glub kind not the bork bork kind.So your reasoning for calling a pupper a doggo is because random people call the small yip yip ones doggos? Lets get penguos and turkos in there then too.Also calling someone a human or an ape? Its not one or the other thats not how taxonomy works. Theyre both. A pupper is a pupper and a member of the doggo family. But thats not what you said. You said a pupper is a doggo which is not true unless youre okay with calling all members of the doggo family doggos which means youd call piggos sluggos and other species doggos too.

Ive never gone through a period when I havent been trying since weve been together even though there were periods when Ive been more successful than others. He specifically mentioned my arms and my stomach. Admittedly those are problem areas but theyre problem areas because of all the weight Ive already lost loose skin.

The hole was actually caused by a defect shes had since birth but her obesity will increase the risk of death during surgery blood clots after surgery and will keep her from recovering very quickly.

Rave I got dumb over the weekend drank a bit too much though minirave kept it at maintenance even though I went over my deficit and the dehydration dropped me down into the s. Ive since regained the water weight but seeing how painfully close the s are has given me new motivation! Lets do it. Rant Yesterday Shark Week got my brain in a mess and I decided to eat my stir fry lunch early because the morning munchies were real. Its not like I was planning on getting a second lunch I just decided to eat it early. Anyway Creepy Boss is laughing hysterically at me asking me how much have you eaten this morning? Project Manager come look at this! You call this a morning snack? I eat less for dinner BAHAHA just being a real douchewagon. I had to step away to avoid throttling him. Like who gives a fuck what I eat or when? My food is not your business. Later he sees me snuggling my hot sock sock full of dry rice that you microwave to make a heating pad and he goes OHHH so THATS why youre eating so much! Watch how much you put away you dont want to get any more bloated than you already are hahahaha I told him I didnt want his input and to go away please. If youre feeling cranky I can send you home  I dont need any attitude in this office. I told him I didnt want his input and that I was fine to keep working and to please go away. Like BITCH I have been working here almost a YEAR and not once have you EVER noticed that Shark Week was happening and it has NEVER impacted my workability just FUCK RIGHT OFF AAAGHHH. I. JUST. DONT. WANT. TO. DEAL. WITH. YOU. GO. AWAY. Guaranfuckingteed if I was overweight he wouldnt be giving me so much shit about my food intake. What is it about people trying to improve their health that just invites so many fucking unsolicited comments from the public? Like kindly fuck right off with that shit with your weak cantlosetheweightbecauseyoulikecheapbeertoomuch ignorant ass. One of the guys from the shop saw I was stressed saw the hot sock and discreetly left three mini dark chocolate Cadbury eggs on my desk with a note with the nutrition facts on it. Bless that man. This morning Creepy Boss said I looked nice I thanked him and he threw a hissy fit because I never compliment him back. So I guess this is where all the assholery comes from? Hes seeking validation? He still didnt get it from me though. I told him compliments shouldnt be given with the expectation of getting something back and walked away.

You may feel shitty emotionally but the physical I dont feel so terrible as last time sets up a feedback loop that eating that much somehow makes you feel less worse than the last time you ate that much.

But they do exist and thus the point the Gone Girl author is trying to make is valid.The flaw in this type of thinking can also be extrapolated out to other things more relevant to this sub. Fat acceptance blogs are an echo chamber in which fat people will often dismiss the struggles of thin women to for example find clothes because it doesnt fit with their anecdotal evidence. They dont think thin people have valid struggles because the experience of the fat person in this instance indicates that they do not. Theyve never seen it so it doesnt exist.
