I went with HSBC years ago it involved rocking up with my company registration cert and a bunch of proof of identify. You sign a billion sheets avoid getting a credit card and debit card they usually cost you a service fee after your initially period. Once that is finished youll receive everything in post. Its possible to setup within a week  you probably wont need those details until you submit your first invoice but various agentscompanies differ.You will need to register for VAT. You can do this yourself fairly easily but its something your accountant should do for you. If youre earning  a day get an accountant at least initially. The real need for an accountant comes with the new Payroll system. RTI. In short a directory needs to clock his hours and submit realtime information to HMRC. You need to do this I cant remember if the fines are in place yet but none the less do it.My recommended accountants are Crunch IT cheapish or meadescontractors expensive. Where you can make sure you they do your end of year accounts for free. Youd also benefit from your personal end of year being filed on your behalf though you have to provide all your personal accounts which is a pain. What out for bullshit fees such as RTI filing expenses annual return costs personal return costs etcDont do what lots of fuckwit contractors do initially and spend the cash you see. It isnt yours its illegal to spend more put your company into debt than your liabilities without an ability repay. At day youll bill    VAT day or  month. Ill assume youll be on flat rate so you get a certain  of that VAT bill back each year. At that rate I wouldnt take more than k per month ideally k per quarter  thatll give you some breathing room should an unexpected bill ariseMy rambling aside youll likely take a salary which accounts for at least your free personal tax allowance per year  year iirc.

Then youre putting the money in an ISA just before the year ticks over in order to maximise the amount that rolls over this mattered more when the limit was lower. So the benefits are as follows over  days or however close you get to a full year your money is earning   whatever your high interest current account pays then for  days it earns a low rate of interest  days at . annual interest is negligible in terms of actual payout but this has the advantage that its now in a taxfree ISA which will roll over to the next year. If you have say k to save you cant put all k in an ISA in the same year because of the limit. But you are allowed to put k in on March st assuming you put nothing in up til that point and then another k into the ISA in April. This would be a good idea if a ISA rates were due to rise or b your highinterest current account was only a limitedtime offer and your ISA might be the best interest rate available to you.

3435292,0,t1_cpjtuqa,Right I see now.  Care  is whats called a defined benefits scheme.  This means that the pension you receive at the end is defined by the rules of the scheme.  In this case for each year you contribute to the scheme you will receive a pension equal to th of your salary in that year.  That pension will be uprated each year based on inflation.The factsheet doesnt say anything at all about if or how much you have to pay into the pension out of your salary each year to earn this benefit.Defined benefit schemes are generally seen as a very good deal for employees.  This is because they are low risk. Short of catastrophic failure of the pension scheme you know exactly what you will get in retirement.  If investment returns from the employee contributions fall short the company has to make up the shortfall.The other type of scheme is defined contribution  in this case your contributions are invested for you and the amount of pension you get in retirement is determined by how well those investments have done over the intervening years.  You might do better out of a defined contribution scheme if investment returns are high but you might also do substantially worse.,UKPersonalFinance,cpjukgm,1,t5_2wkka

3774439,0,t1_cqmhvyf,gt Good point about having an emergency fund. I can definitely see how it would be useful. However would I not be able to withdraw the money that is in the ISA if I needed it?Yes you can. However there is no guarantee of the state of the market when you wish to withdraw the money. Ideally you want the capital as in liquid form as reasonably possible for an emergency fund. Lets say the markets have just crashed and you suddenly need the money? Do you crystalise that loss or alternatively use some other funds set aside as a designated emergency fund that will not immediately damage your wealth? Again you need to remember this is a relatively small sum in the scale of things however it is a good size to act as an emergency fund at the end of university. gt However I think that it is inevitable that Technology will increase more over  years than a portfolio that has exposure to real estate cash bonds different countries commodities etc.If you accept you are using this as a learning experience or as a bit of risky fun that is fine. If your only goal is absolute return you should look at any investment more objectively. However consider why the majority total growth funds are not wholly invested in technology stocks?

Youre only going to make things worse if you continue to apply right now.So Ive been in a position before where I kept getting buggered by banking fees  and youre right its a frustrating cycle. I promise you that taking out a loan is not a solution but better budgeting can be. And whatever you are thinking  dont even approach a payday loan company. They charge around  in interestAPR. Now  as to approaching and getting yourself out of this  a few things to do Your BankYou havent mentioned in your post where you have spoken to your bank and explained your circumstances asked for formal overdraft or challenges the fees. Under Banking and Lending codes  banks must treat you fairly if you are in financial hardship  and certainly living in your overdraft income eaten by charges or potentially living off credit with overdraft fees pushing you into your overdraft would count as this. Tell your bank and they have a duty of care to help. They may reverse some of the charges or minimise them or something similar. Id also attempt to set up a formal overdraft facility with your bank. Explain your circumstances and estimate when you can get out of the overdraft. Call them and ask for these things as your priority.You may also benefit from changing to a bank with more favourable overdraft rates. May be worth a read Vodafone and ApplePlease dont fall into a trap of blaming these two vendors for this  whether you like it or not you have a contract with Vodafone and cancelling the DD just means youre then failing to pay the bill  meet the contractual obligations. Anyway this is in the past now.If you can get the situation in writing from either supplier as to the reasoning for the charge. You can use this to write to credit reference agencies explaining the history on your credit report. Vodafone should be able to reversechange some items on your credit score i.e. your cancelled direct debit on their advice if you report the complaint. I think.I would certainly be somewhat assertive with both suppliers to challenge the issues they caused you. Complain where you can. Credit ScoreYou can request copies of your credit scores from the main credit reference agencies for a small fee and Noddle will give you a free version. You can challenge items on your credit report  write to the agencies to get the lines removed etc. May be worth while in your situation. FutureYou didnt talk about your income or situation  but I would wager there are areas within your finances you could cut down on in order to make up some shortfall. Put yourself into a financial lock down. Draw up a budget if you dont already have one  work out what your actual outgoing are and work out where you can reduce. YNAB rynab is a good resource for this but is only a methodology.Once youre out of this begin to build an emergency fund.

And even if it does work out will you make enough in enough time to be able to gift her k a year for what  years  or a lump sum equivalent that can give her k a year for the rest of her life ? is that even her target required income ? What if your company goes bust  years down the line  ?   of new businesses fail within the first  years in the UKHeres the thing you are what ?  years old ? you can afford to take the risk on a company working out because you literally have time to start over if it doesnt. But your mum doesnt have that time available. She should have her own plan to have an income in retirement. Saying she cant retire is not good enough an answer .  Peoples bodies start breaking down as you get older. It gets harder and harder to do an  hour working day. My own mum at  now was struggling with that at  years of age.  She needs a target age at which she wants to retire and a plan to get her an income for that.  years of compound interest on a lump sum you can add an amount equal to your salary every year and still get tax relief on it and regular contributions from her and her employer to a pension are perfectly capable of achieving that based on what youve said and thats a very low risk approach to retirement income. A k income for life and owning her own home are within reach based on what youve said.If your company works out great  but imo its far far far too high risk for her to be betting her retirement on  retirement planning is all about low risk  which is the opposite of your idea. ,UKPersonalFinance,csuzqez,12,t5_2wkka

4613203,0,t3_3e6ady,Hell need to phone the DWP but it sounds like a simple mistake has been made. Benefits are thoroughly bureaucratic and not at all punitive. If the DWP believes your dad has received money he shouldnt have they will get it back. Currently they seem to believe that his other two children are not dependents of his any more. He will probably have to provide proof in the form of a letter from the school andor proof of ID at least thats what we asked for in local government national government may differ.It doesnt matter how late their decision is there is no statute of limitations there does appear to be for debt but benefits arent debt. It also doesnt matter that a financial advisor didnt tell him about it its still your dads responsibility. He may be able to reclaim the money from the financial advisor through the courts but would need to ask a lawyer. Regardless its a separate issue.He will need to pay back CB for you from when you stopped full time education. Since he has other children this will be at the lower rate the higher CB rate will pass to the next oldest when you become non dependent. He will not be charged interest and not be charged any fees unless he fails to pay and the debt gets sent to an external debt collection agency  at that point the agencys fees would get added onto the existing debt. If he receives any local government benefits like child tax credit or housing benefit there will likely be more money to pay back so he should contact them immediately.EDIT Rereading the post I didnt realise that this happened a couple of years ago. If hes still receiving CB for two children then the DWP knows that theyre still his dependents. It sounds like theres either more to this than you are aware of or your dad needs to contact them immediately to figure out where the extra charges came from. Doesnt matter how long ago it happened.,UKPersonalFinance,ctc2pdd,2,t5_2wkka

4994616,0,t3_3ja4w7,Hi ill make a few points in no particular order dont stop soon  stop now.  quitting cigarettes is going to be tough whenever you do it and being sleepdeprived by a newborn isnt going to make it any easier. not to mention youre wasting money while you work up to it. stop procrastinating and do it today! i honestly believe that it is possible to live on the income you describe. i havent done the maths but we know that people do it. the question is whether you should? because i would argue that from what little info you have given you get on well with the parents well enough that they are discouraging you from leaving and you should embrace that.  you can see tales on reddit of kids getting kicked out of their family home on their th birthday and it is awesome that you are in a much better position. if they have the space stick with them. sticking with the parents will help with money try and save dont spend what you save on rent on something you dont need but it will also help with the baby. i have an  month old and one thing i learnt is that the more adults there are around the better.  babies suck up your time and if someone else is cooking or holding the baby while you cook it makes a world of difference to your wellbeing. if theyre up for it bite their arm off. final point is this  youre . no judgement here but this is quite young to be a parent and you both have still got plenty of growing to do.  you may know what you want to do with the rest of your life but that could easily change in a few years time. take your time to make smart thoughtout decisions as a family and dont rush into them. chill out and ask this question again in  months  youll know a shitload more than you do now and it could well influence your decision. good luck and congratulations!,UKPersonalFinance,cuo1cpa,11,t5_2wkka

You will need to set up a direct debit to pay off this minimum amount each month.

This works the same way  you still have your agreed  overdraft to use how you wish. After a period of time  years for Natwest the Graduate account then becomes a regular current account. At this point your overdraft is no longer .You overdraft limit remains the same however you are charged interest on it  and if you go over the overdraft limit youll be hit with some hefty fees.,UKPersonalFinance,czfkqwq,1,t5_2wkka

6544195,0,t1_czw0duj,Depends on the banks involved and if theres any foreign currency involvement. The longer the payment chain the more fees will be incurred. Usually transferring in the same banking group will be feefree e.g. all Citi accounts worldwide or HSBC or Standard Chartered  however they might quote you bad FX rates.Always check the bank FX rate and see if you get more money paying a broker to do the transfer for you because they give you better rates.For instance  take something easy like transferring to a Eurodenominated account in Germany. The process would go something like this Youd choose what currency to send  likely EUR. You choose the payment method  EUR payments in the Single Euro Payments Area SEPA are mandated to go via SCT i.e the SEPA Credit Transfer system by EU law which luckily for consumers tries to restrict prices to domestic equivalent of comparable type i.e. wire transfers but for different currencies and destinations you might have more options. Your bank account in the UK is denominated in GBP but you want to send EUR so your bank will quote you a FX rate  this will most likely not be the midmarket rate you see on websites but a price they just quote you its likely to be  the midmarket but could be a lot more. Its their way of making profits on top of transfer fees. They will also charge you a separate fee for making the payment on their end. Your receiving bank will receive EUR from your UK bank  they might have terms saying that they charge x amount for incoming foreignSEPA payments.If you have a more complicated payment chain then the fees add up  for instance say you wanted to send SEK from a Vietnamese account based in Hanoi to your Swedish Krona account at Citibank in London Citi use Svenska Handelsbanken as their correspondent bank so youd have to make the currency conversion from VND to SEK send it to the Swedish bank to credit Citibank in London to credit Citibank Europes account to credit your SEK account with them. Then imagine all those Citibank accounts were different banks  you can imagine the fees!In terms of foreign spending cards  I think Metrobank are fee free for debit and credit cards in the SEPA countries and if you are in Asia then theres the various no FX charge credit cards like Nationwide Select Lloyds Avios Post Office Halifax Clarity one of the Aqua ones etc. However its still recommended to get a local bank account as credit card acceptance is not entirely widespread and your bank fraud detectors might give you a hard time which is a hassle to sort out when abroad.,UKPersonalFinance,czw819q,2,t5_2wkka

And that should be about it for your legal costs excl. stamp duty.The APR probably isnt the best figure to use. You want to use the initial rate which should be significantly lower. The APR is over the course of  years which includes the rate increase after your fixed term. Realistically you will remortgage in  years and get another fixed period based on your reduced borrowing requirementincreased house value fingers crossed!. Regarding the mortgage fee this can be bundled in to your borrowing cost e.g. you borrow k instead which is pretty common especially if money is tight. Skipping that fee up front will mean you can buy sofatvfridge etc. Also id recommend at least meeting a mortgage broker and seeing what they have to offer. Many offer free advice with no fees and they get the commission from the lender. The big added benefit is that they will submit all the documents for you and know how to do itwhat is expected. Takes a lot of weight off your shoulders.If you do go for a mortgage broker just make sure they look at the whole of the market.

6843313,0,t3_49i5aa,Detached Duty Relief is really just part of the rules governing working at a temporary workplace and this is where the UKs tax rules are actually quite welcome to nonresidents. The right of return to the Middle East is not decisive in and of itself  like everything to do with residence domicile and international tax it is all about the substance of the facts of the situation. Presumably you have more permanent links to another country which you can use as the basis of a claim that the secondment to the UK is temporary.There are two separate considerations here if you can argue with HMRC that your stay in the UK is temporary and you have no plans to settle in the UK then you can claim you are resident but not ordinarily resident in the UK and furthermore if you have permanently links elsewhere you can claim you are not domiciled in the UK.Then you would make claims relating to your required attendance at the temporary workplace  the home you would rent if you buy you may be deemed to want to settle here and thus the choice of home would be personal rather than a requirement of your employment and therefore not attract travel and subsistence relief and travel tofrom your place of work under that basis. This is only available to you personally as the employee.The second consideration is this even if accommodation costs are disallowed i.e. you will be deemed to be resident and ordinarily resident there are special rules for foreign travel although you will be resident in the UK you can potentially claim that you are not domiciled in the UK  which country are you a national of?  and provided you meet certain requirements you can claim relief under the special rules which essentially allow taxrelief on the benefitinkind your employer gives you to meet travel costs to the UK from home and also for you and your family to visit the UK from your domicile or elsewhere.Essentially you must not have been resident in the UK for the two preceding tax years from when you come here which you would likely qualify for.The costs for home travel provided for by the employer being deductible is under s. of the Income Tax Earnings and Pensions Act Do note that the tax relief is available generally only if your employer includes this as a benefit in kind as part of your package rather than you being paid x and privately choosing to rentbuy a cartravel etc. as that may class your choices as personal ones rather than being directed by your employer.

As soon as all of these purchases are complete transfer the balance immediately to the  card. I have factored in the fee which in some cards is a lit some a little and a few that have no fee.

Not really anything Incan do with that.

Then at least you have a number to work with. Use this money to start being independent i.e. rent a place then get a job. Your mom has no say in this as you can do this all by yourself. Perhaps learn to budget. Know exactly you need to spend to survive in a month i.e. rent bills food etc things you have to pay no matter what. Know your income or guess if you are looking for a job. Then stick to the plan. Read the sidebar on budgeting . Impulse buying... I dont know man sounds like you just need to look at your budget so you know how much you can actually afford to spend in a month.

Hopefully there are enough scared investors out there who wont care about that rating and still pile in to Gilts But I digress.If you can afford property now you are going to get a good deal exploit sellers fears and lowball them.

One factor will be the report that they get from one or more of following Equifax Experian and CallCredit but others can be where you live any entries in a fraud DB like CIFAS.This is why Im pretty much guaranteed to get a new credit card with MBNA but Halifax are more likely to reject me I saw this both in the tool I used from MSE and from personal experiance a few years ago.My background is IT but I worked in lending around  and one of our products was a shortterm loan the automatic credit score for this product would determine if you needed the loan and would pass you to the credit analysis team for further checking  effectively rejecting you for having too good a credit score!,UKPersonalFinance,d5oyeqm,1,t5_2wkka

8418506,0,t3_4uwrev,Ah a perennial question here on the UKPF sub!If your money is in a Limited Company then of course it is not your money it is the companys money  if the company is allowed to make these investments according to its articles of association then by all means it is allowed.Dividends  distributions in respect of shares  can only be made from profits available for the purpose of making the dividend. The board can of course decide not to make the money available for dividends but instead to invest in various other assets.If you do go down this route though I would strongly recommend you set up a holding company and dividend the money to that company to make the investments though. Remember gains on investments held by a company are subject to Corporation Tax. If you are a sole trader then the business bank account is property in your personal name. You are welcome to make investments in stocks and property. You would still though be liable to income tax on the profits of your trade  investments in stocks and property are not allowable expenses although you might technically be able to make a capital allowance claim.,UKPersonalFinance,d5tuu8b,2,t5_2wkka

The regulations afaiunderstand them mean that goods must be fit for purpose. If they fail within  months its assumed that theyre basically not fit for purpose unless the seller can prove they were fine. Beyond that you can still go back to the seller. You may need to give more evidence youve not damaged or broken things yourself but you still have the right to go back to them and get it fixed replaced or refunded their choice. If you get a refund this is only required to cover the proportion of time you lost out on so if they can argue the expected lifespan is  years and it broke in  you get ths of your money back.As I understand it there is no limit to the timeframe on this. Under the older sales of goods act you had  years after discovering the fault under the newer act it sounds like you have  years after theyve refused to fix it to go through small claims court.In practice youre likely to get a decent response when pushing for a fix by bringing these things up as for many products its simply not worth the cost and effort to take it to court for the company.

8626391,0,t3_4xzgsd,I am very short on time at the moment so forgive me for being briefer than I would normally be in a first reply but extraction of cash from a Limited Company is a regular topic on this sub e.g. once every couple of months. Have a look at If you are thinking of doing things with profit shifting etc. with transfer pricing you should be very careful with the antiavoidance provisions out there. I wrote about this in this sub a few months ago Essentially even if you dont fall within the Transfer Pricing rules there are the Controlled Foreign Company and Diverted Profit Tax rules to watch out for.  Dividends between UK companies are not chargeable to Corporation Tax  thus the main tax charge comes between moving from the business sphere to the personal sphere. So really what to do with the money will affect how you structure your affairs. If you make large employer pension contributions remember the money is the companys money not yours until you dividend it or pay yourself a salary  then for them to be allowable expenses they must be justifiable as reasonable i.e. would a reasonable arms length employee accept a similar remuneration package?If you pay yourself nothing apart from k of pension contributions those expenses may be argued to not be allowable. You probably dont want to spend extra money taking it to the FTT. Im unsure how you are losing a lot to corporate taxes when Corporation Tax is  and personal tax ranges from   NI  If you want to continue to invest in businesses you might consider keeping money in the corporate wrapper and then when it comes to exit take advantage of Entrepreneurs Relief EIS SEIS and VCT will be your main ways of reducing your personal income tax bill Return from investments is a separate consideration to structuring it at this level of wealth  decide what you want to invest in first!Good luck!,UKPersonalFinance,d6jwhkb,10,t5_2wkka

You can then simply say this saver gives you X after  year which then becomes comparable with current accounts. Just have to work out whether any regular savers are worth having over a current account right now though. The difficulty here is that you dont have a static X that you earn interest on but an income of Y per month where you need to decide whether its best to use Y to Fill up bank account XYZ or...

As an example the car listed for k is actually only worth k with enough profit margin still left to be worth it to the dealer. The k remaining then can enable negotiation room and finance deals. Because of the finance they can sell it to people that couldnt otherwise afford it. For cash buyers that dont care about the price or dont realise there is negotiation room the dealership skim an extra k out of them. And for smarter cash buyers they can drop the price in negotiation by k before hitting their target profit margin  the buyer feels good about themselves and the dealership might be able to get them to settle somewhere in the middle. The cheapest way to buy a car new is almost always in cash when negotiating from a position of being able to convince the dealer youll walk away. ,UKPersonalFinance,dam4t4t,3,t5_2wkka

10748789,0,t1_ddonliz,Step   Future SavingsNow the current situation is in order you need to look to the future. When you get to the point of retirement the Safe Withdrawal Rate SWR of your accumulated funds need to be able to match your desired income. A typical SWR is probably  depends on your attitude to risk to match your current takehome salary of pa would therefore require near million of savings. Before you despair however remember we have already established you comfortably live on less than your current take home salary as you save pm and probably have some expenditure which you can cut. Even that pm is pa requiring  less in the bank  see what I meant about savings in your budget making life easier?In terms of pension savings you have a moderate nest egg already which should grow a fair amount before you can access it at  at the earliest. If your pension returns pa between now and then approximately the long term return from equities your current pension pot will grow by .x. In addition the pot is currently having pm put in to it between you and your employer that is  of contributions between now and  irrespective of returns.Nonetheless you could probably do with increasing your savings rate. This can be done between contributions to your SampS ISA and perhaps it might be wise to open a personal pension usually a SIPP. The advantage of a SIPP is HMRC will top up any contributions by your marginal tax rate  up to a total pension contribution including your work pension of pa realistically you wont hit that. Downsides are income tax above the personal allowance on withdrawal and not being able to access it until . If you open a SIPP with a broker while its small you might want to use a percentage fee broker rather than a flat fee see this table from Monevator to compare costs you get control of what the money within it is invested in most people just put it in to the same products as they use for their SampS ISA.Lets say you manage to increase your savings rate to pm. Put half of that in the SIPP and half in your SampS ISA. This means your SIPP grows by pa  of contributions  income tax refund and your ISA by pa. Lets also assume you start transferring your SAYE funds in to your ISA as above another pa and that you put  of your currently unsheltered cash into the ISA using this and next years allowances. Current situation  in SampS ISA company pension pot  SIPP  Contributions as above including SAYE and company pension Returns pa in SIPP and ISA pa in company pension Values at age  SampS ISA  Company pension  SIPP . Total value  SWR . Values at age  SampS  Company pension  SIPP . Total Value  SWR .  Even if we cut those returns to  for SIPP and ISA and  for company pension Values at age  SampS ISA  Company pension  SIPP . Total value  SWR .  Values at age  SampS  Company pension  SIPP . Total Value  SWR . As you can see the returns really ratchet up. At those saving rates you would need about pa to continue your lifestyle in retirement however you should note that at least part of your withdrawals those from the pensions might be subject to income tax albeit at basic  rate. Another proviso is that this doesnt account for inflation which will eat away at your real return rate but that is hard to model and all we can do to counteract it is save more and invest for better returns.ConclusionYouve definitely not left things too late you earn enough to retire early it will take some discipline with your savings between now and then and as with all of us you will be beholden to global market performances to some extent.

10795267,0,t1_ddtg237,Cheers Borax!There certainly are a whole host of PF bloggers. From the few Ive seen it appears that most are the two extremes  one group focuses on technical analysis charts trend lines silly little tricks that simply defy financial logic and the other group focuses on aspects that are sound theoretically and logically but dont always work.The questions Id hope to tackle are things like.... How do I minimise transaction costs even though I cant negotiate the cost per trade.. I dont have the time or energy to research companies thoroughly  how do I still invest in a disciplined and relatively safe manner?. Whats APR? AER?. Whats the difference between a mutual fund an index fund etc?. Should I invest in UK or internationally? If its the latter how and where?At the same time I appreciate that a lot of questions e.g. APR vs AER can be answered by a simple google search. It does baffle and really worry me that people dont know this  thats not me placing blame on them or saying its stupid that they dont know it. Its worrying that they dont know it and of course the reason is because they werent taught it.,UKPersonalFinance,ddtge0k,8,t5_2wkka

In return I made what many on this sub would consider a trivial low effort response on the assumption that you truly believed it wasnt possible to actually fully? live on kpa when I know thats not true.

10922342,0,t1_de3cz0k,Thanks for the great response and sorry if I can just ask more?Ive had a busy couple of days so sorry for the late reply. Youve hit it right I am cautious with finances Im not adverse to risk generally but with something on this scale its big.When you saygt whether you can afford the repayments if interest rates rise by  percentage points.Why  percent? Is that a standard figure to plan with. I know we cant realistically know what is going to happen but it could potentially rise to   ? Is that right?We budget pretty well we are careful with money and the saving over the last  years has made us very careful with our spendingbudgeting. But its getting my head around the finances like sure we can afford a mortgage of . a month right now but if interest goes up ridiculously we perhaps couldnt afford a . mortgage for example. So I dont quite grasp how people plan for that or at least factor it into their decision making. If interest prices rose to that degree wouldnt half the UK be in serious financial peril or are people just VERY careful with their mortgages for example I said we could afford . mortgage right now but should I even be considering that? A fixed term is definitely on my mind but even then a fixed term would only protect us for    years or whatever we decide? I know you pay a premium for the security but what happens if after year  the current interest rates are sky high after  years you could lose the house just like that? In the extreme case.That brings me on to renegotiating a mortgage. Once the fixed term was over lets use  years for this example. Would the mortgage payments over  years make much of a difference when I come to renegotiate the mortgage? Are the initial years the hardest? The adviser is a broker yes can I just ask them to check the whole market or will they check whatever they like?On the pricing I agree with what you say. The house for us is more of a home and the one we have seen would potentially be perfect for life without the need or desire to move. But its been on the market for  months now desirable location with  different estate agents and not sold. So its either overpriced or theres something underlying I just cant put my finger on it.Thanks very much for all the help and advice anything more you can add is fantastic.

11013172,0,t3_5x9b33,I would suggest start by figuring out what the equivalent DC portfolio size would need to be to give you the same benefits as the DB scheme. Once you have that you can compare how much each employer needs to pay into your DC scheme to match the DB one. There are three ways Ive gone about this. The first is to take your expected future annual payout from the DB scheme and get a quote from an annuity firm for providing the same benefit. That value is roughly equivalent though very conservative to the corresponding final portfolio value in a DC scheme. In reality you can probably get the same benefits from a smaller DC portfolio because youre avoiding the annuity companys profits. A second option is to take your annual DB benefit and divide it by  as an alternative estimate for an equivalent DC portfolio value. This is based on the Safe Withdrawal Rate principle. Lastly the HMRC use a x multiplier of your annual DB benefit to determine what the DC equivalent would be. These methods all come up with different answers because none of them are exactly equivalent but give you a rough comparison.  Now that you know what your final DC portfolio size would need to be to match the DB benefits you can work out how much you and your employer will need to contribute every month to get to that size by the time you retire and then you can compare which is better. The truth is there is no easy and accurate way because its heavily influenced by risk and what will happen in the markets between now and when you will retire. ,UKPersonalFinance,degb8w7,3,t5_2wkka

Should I try get as much in there as possible whilst Im here or find an alternative pension that I can contribute for longer term?A pension match is like free money.  You should absolutely get as much free money as you can.  When you leave you have two options available to you.  Either the money can remain in the existing pension growing with the stock market or it can be turned into a transfer value and brought elsewhere such as if your new employer has a better pension scheme or if you want to manage it yourself in a SIPP.  Bear in mind that employers likely wont contribute pension matches to your SIPP directly only to their own pension scheme so having the employer pension is a good idea.Dont put off your pension get money in there as soon as you can the growth is what will help over time hopefully doubling quadrupling octupling your money.

In this case the oftennoted places to look are the lists on Monevator for finding a good platform usually Charles Stanley shows up at the top.When it comes to what to invest in thats for you to determine yourself  it has to be something you have confidence and comfort in because its less important about the return than that youre not getting itchy fingers to withdraw it any time the market has a slightly negative day illustration  last year my portfolio was at  from purchase price today it closed . from purchase price and I havent thought about withdrawing once in that whole period.,UKPersonalFinance,den39aw,2,t5_2wkka

Infact I think most of central London is so squashed together that almost every other street is a council block. Maybe it was just the area I lived in...When I was in my early s I lived in a massive council block in south London. I think in the year I was there there was one shooting outside. And one pizza delivery driver was pushed off and had his moped stolen. Could be more of a London thing though.Id say a lot depends on who lives there and what the general area is like. I had a school friend years ago... whos mother moved into a house opposite council houses after a divorce. That was when they first had people harass them outside their own home or people trying to break into their garage constantly. Obviously theres was nothing to say who it was or where they lived. But he always attributed it to having moved opposite council houses. Im not trying to make generalizations or anything.
