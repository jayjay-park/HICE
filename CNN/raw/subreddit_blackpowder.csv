428182,0,t3_1yyhu2,I suspect that the frame does not actually stretch.  What happens is the cylinder is thrust backwards where it is stopped by the back face of the frame.  With the cylinder being steel and the frame being brass naturally over time and under heavy loads the steel hammers an impression of the cylinder into the brass.You can see a picture of this hereNotice how with the frame on the right you can clearly see where the cylinder has embossed itself into the frame.What this does is increase the play between the face of the cylinder and the face of the barrel.  From that perspective it does appear that the frame has stretched but really the cylinder is just free to retreat into the pockets it has smashed into the frame.Some people have tried to mitigate this deformation by soldering or otherwise attaching a steel race track to the frame face after first removing an appropriate amount of material.I agree that the peening should be reduced with a . caliber gun as opposed to a ..  But I would expect over time to see the problem anyway.You will almost certainly find that maximum accuracy does not come at maximum load anyway.  Some people find maximum accuracy in the . with  grains of F powder.  Personally if I had a choice Id avoid a brass framed revolver unless I was trying to buy one that was historically made with a brass frame.,blackpowder,cfp5a1d,5,t5_2utpy

2690071,0,t1_cn9mitt,Im the worst person to ask about this but I would say DONT!! Its not just the difference in power its also the difference in combustion. Theres a reason black powder makes more of a whoompf noise while smokeless goes BANG! My understanding is that smokeless creates more pressure and heat at a faster rate than black powder.,blackpowder,cn9pmvs,1,t5_2utpy

8498291,0,t3_4w4cp0,I went to my grandpa today and I knew he had this in the shed for years I used to play with it as a kid. I dont know anything about it really apart from that it might be Dutch or at least European.Im fairly sure its a replica given that the wooden stock is drilled directly into the barrel and the end of the barrel appears to be a nut as its only round in the last cm the rest from what I can tell is hexagonal all the way through. I also cant find any proofmarks or lettering on it either.Length  cm  Barrel Length . cm  Barrel Diameter  cm  Barrel inner diameter . cm,blackpowder,d63u62o,2,t5_2utpy
9211862,0,t3_56cz13,Depending on where you are do check with the range before you bring blackpowder guns. Many ranges frown upon blackpowder. I went shooting one time with  shots with my  Remy no problem. Next time went in to break in a new  Colt had some ignition issues probably humidity in the powder and the range officer outright told me to stop bringing BP guns citing safety issues. Was a different range officer that time the hardass type the kind that likes to babysit right behind you. I hate people standing behind me when Im shooting.,blackpowder,d8jo79d,3,t5_2utpy
