Distracted he then proceeds to abandon his sister. What happens next is for your imagination.Id love to think Im some sort of creative genius who can embed a message that leaps out at you upon the fifth time of reading but this is my first attempt at a short scary story!

313615,0,t3_1xmcdz,Terrifyingly horrible! I absolutely love it!Only set of crit I would say is this sentence Mrs. Philips watches the police leave through her window. reads like she was watching them climb out her window. I loved the imagery of that Having just told the mother of the missing child they still had not found him the policemen doffed their hats and left. Out the window. Officer Jenkins went first and got stuck. Really Jenkins? This is the third time this week! Officer OReilly said. He turned back to the grieving mother interrupting her maniacal hand steepling. Dont worry maam this happens all the time. Its not because you have small windows OReilly said interpreting her incredibly guilty look. Oh she said Im not worried and cackled loudly. Right... said OReilly. You...shouldnt be. Eventually they were able to get Jenkins through the window by having OReilly go out the door and pull and the pair were on their way. Another day gone another day spent protecting the peace and providing comfort to the small and not well able to protect themselves OReilly said posing on the front lawn. Might want to work on that slogan there OReilly Jenkins said. Just eat your doughnut OReilly replied.Mrs. Phillips evil laughter followed them down the street.In all seriousness this is now one of my favorite stories on here.

424421,0,t1_cfopdpz,Its the tone of your text.  It reeks of misconceived superiority.  You also appear to have tunnel vision and ignore the big picture.  First allow me to direct you here  You will see that after his response I replied that while I did not believe in god I conceded that perhaps one who does might find that scary.  In my response to you above I wrote that I would never find this to be a scary story and I stand by this but as you said in the post immediately above my opinion does not define the horror genre.  In that we are agreed.  I however am much less conceited when I say it.Next Id like to bring up the religious argument.  Are you seriously going to say you werent aware of the mudslinging that believers and nonbelievers were throwing at one another before a moderator stepped in? Id like to provide you a link but the biggest culprit already deleted his post not that this is indicative of all Christians but he happened to be a believer.  Your response came while that was going on.  Others had tried to tie me in with that foolishness and you appeared to be doing the same.  You denied this above and Ill take that at face value.  For you to not know that was going on is curious though.  I guess it was just my post you had a problem with and decided you wouldnt bother reading anything else.

1109119,0,t1_chtumvg,Thats an interesting question and one that actually comes up a lot in the context of cognitive psychology probably other areas of psychology too. It seems the main thought on the subject is that humans think in terms of language either internally spoken thoughts or internally written words.I have a huge problem with this as I dont think that way. Pretty much all of my thinking is done in pictures or in nonspecific urges. From discussions Ive had with other researchers it seems like this verbal method of thinking is more typical. Unfortunately most of our theories about human cognition and speech processing hinge on verbal thinking as the primary method of cognition for humans. But if there are a good number of us who think in pictures and smells and urges and feelings that means that these general theories are incorrect.,shortscarystories,chud50o,4,t5_2t6kz

1864640,0,t1_ckde5xe,Id be glad to flesh it out a bit if you could point me to the right sub. The idea is basically Felix is the last unconverted ones who will not make it to the afterlife for some reason or another. If he had taken his own life he would have made it to the afterlife and as the only one in the afterlife he probably would have assumed the responsibilities of God and respawned or reevolved P the human race. Behind the scenes is some nefarious force trying to make sure we as humans cease to exist either to become their slaves just for kicks or what have you. We assume they can see and manipulate infinite universes and this is more or less a day job of the denizens of this realm. Try to convert all the humans. Though theyve been at it for whoknows how long none of them had ever successfully converted every single human until John had the stroke of genius to impersonate Felixs mother right at the end tricking him to die a natural death by becoming converted instead of taking his own life making it to the afterlife and winning the game for the humans. As soon as Felix is tagged by Them the human race is officially destroyed.TLDR John is the most successful incarnation of Lucifer ever.

They try to imagine what happened and how but the lack of certainty is what makes this story good. But think about it she was hung or was found hung once. So they probably untied the rope and took the dead body somehwere else probably a morgue. Then the body is found hanging again. Who did that and why ?

2329544,0,t1_clf1fpr,The problem with details like this is they completely suspend the disbelief of the reader. It becomes very difficult for the reader to understand or become immersed in the story. When youre writing complete fiction details arent as important but adding elements of truth require the truth to be truthful. Regardless it was a good story and all the people ITT are trying to help you improve.

His own sick need for her to be his sister was slowly killing her and everyone around her simply understood her being haunted as a condition.

I know the story is bad. I wasnt going to post it but I did so I dont get into the habit of writing and then deleting right away without posting. Fortunately I posted it so I now know that on top of it being bad its hard to follow. So I can even make improvements there.The premise is a horrible place where people without empathy routinely kill vagabonds via opportunistic hit and runs.I was inspired by this news that made it to Reddits front page a while ago The copper stealing falling corpses was added to make it surreal since though this happens a few times here and there never to be something so constant as rain.,shortscarystories,cuwwn1x,1,t5_2t6kz

6675359,0,t1_d09s5ex,Ive always believed in snapshots a la David Lynch  I dont know the entire backstory and neither do the characters. And we all dont have the words to spend on it  we just know that its her secret it tastes good and Tim melts. Explanation is kind of unnecessary  you know what happens  the boy melts obviously  so how do you take it from there? The story was kind of written as a response to these questions  Why?  Why not?  so I dont feel like anyone benefits from it. I think its always better when the reader fills in the gaps presented  I hate explaining. Dont you? When the horror movie spells out for you in a monotone voice why everything is happening? Sometimes it just does. Its a personal preference and thank you  I just bogged down in presenting an explanation. Sometimes weird and inexplicable things just happen  and thats where I find horror. In fact  I wish I could brand my writing as weirddark fantasy instead of straightup horror...theres no one kicking open a door and stabbing someone...its just subtle.

6928861,0,t1_d11p8g4,This is a good point.  That conflict resulted from me starting this story with no idea what would be happening later at first I just had this character who was sleepwalking with funky eyes and who was uncertain about what was really going on.I liked how the uncertainty in that line sounded when I first wrote it but now that the future narrator has solidified into a willing party its probably not necessary.   Ill give it another look and see if I cant fix that inconsistency. Thanks for the comment.EDIT  Gave it another read and tried to fix the line by making it more certain but still with a twinge of uncertainty since it happened in a fugue state.  Also added an additional line at the end of the next paragraph which I think hope makes the whole train of thought seem more appropriate.

10826649,0,t1_ddwi7sh,I was at a small party mabey  or  people. It was around  and we started getting bored playing board games and it was already well after dark so we decided to tel some scary stories.This one girl who I had never seen before other than on some instagram group chats was there and she said that she had an extremely vivid dream a few years ago. There were a few people the most important of whom are a set of twins around  years old and a man only known as the crazy man. The crazy man said that they must explore the cabin that they were in and find a lot of salt an a lot of bread she gave specific amounts but I cant remember at the moment. However I think it was  cups of salt. However sometimes when you walked into a room it would show you footage of someone who looks remarkably similar to you dying in a horrible manner. And a lot of times after that happened you would die in the exact same way.Over the next few days a lot of them got picked off. A notable example is the twins. One of them went off to look for the other one and the first place he checked was the bathroom. Then to other twin came in. They decided to check another room when a projection of the other twin walking into the bathroom. Pretty soon the door closes and locks and the lights turn red. the crazy man emerges and ends up horribly mutilating the twin. The other twin then figures he better go and check on the his brother and he goes to look for him in the bathroom first.After about a week of being in that place they find an expansive salt flat and a massive tub of bread. A woman comes out and says how good the bread and another woman comes out saying that shes wrong and its full of worms. To prove a point the woman who says that the bread is good eats it and then gets eaten by some worms. The scary man comes up and says that they could be free if they just claim it. They argue whether or not they should because it is bad bread but after a wile my friend just screams I claim this I claim all of it and throws the bread on the floor. She then woke up. There was someone else with her and she trapped them there.I know it probably wont sound as convincing in text as it did in person but I believe that she might have been sent to another universe or something. And if this dream actually happened on some other plain right now there is someone trapped there forever.,shortscarystories,ddwoxsm,6,t5_2t6kz

These arent professional writers so stop expecting them to be. Theyre doing their best. If someone blatantly sucks then instead of saying you suck please stop you give them tips for improving. not that thats the case hereAlso yes exactly A man being pregnant is preposterous completely not normal. So theyd be hard pressed to find an extraction solution. Youre right that the dick hole thing wouldnt be an obvious answer but if after extensive research and tests which lets face it theyd obviously conduct it was shown that thats the safest way to get it out of him due to it being able to expand or something and lets face it thats not so ridiculous any more considering its a guy who managed to get pregnant in the first place then theyd opt for that.Though there is a good reason that painkiller drugs are an option for birthing and this is exactly that considering how painful that must be. But again they might not have thought of this or the drugs might have proven to be potentially fatal in blood tests.,shortscarystories,dflr57u,1,t5_2t6kz
