399651,0,t3_1ynyln,Thats not an uncommon fantasy but I second the notion that it is VERY risky letting a guy ejaculate in you. Wear protection each and every time you have sex.If there is ever a point where you settle down with someone and decide to be monogamous and you are both safe and have both been tested you can try having unprotected sex but dont make a stupid mistake that will affect your entire life!Good luck and have fun!,lgbtsex,cfm6tvk,5,t5_2sk5b
737532,0,t1_cgno3sf,This is pretty good advice but since you mention actually wanting to hookup I would actually encourage you to visit an appsite like Grindr Manhunt AA etc.  Identify your boundaries and interests going in mention wanting to be discreet be honest about yourself to others and be clear about your expectations.  If it makes you feel more comfortable I would encourage you to blur your face if you choose to submit photos.  I recommend these sites because there is often an expectation that youre only seeking a hookup and the people on the sites understand that youre on the down low right now.,lgbtsex,cgo40uo,1,t5_2sk5b
1046234,0,t1_chmdzfq,The smaller plugs work fine and I get what youre saying about relaxing but how can I tell if what Im pushing into is just a stubborn muscle or legit scar tissue?In a kind of reply to both responses at onceId like to talk to my doctor about it but the appointment is quite a bit away and I think Id be nervous to talk about it in person let alone over the phone.,lgbtsex,chn7mnj,1,t5_2sk5b
1612841,0,t3_2crz5l,Lube siliconebased is best. It lasts a long time and dries soft and smooth.  Ive used a lot of water based lubes and then I tried Pjur and never bothered to try another. I imagine that most any silicone lube will be as good though.The important thing to note about silicone lube is that it can fuse with silicone toys. Test it on your toy by rubbing a dab on the base. You should see a pretty immediate reaction if there will be one. But in any case a condom on your toys will keep them safe and makes cleanup easier too.Toys not an expert here my toys were bought for usage with harnesses. But anything with a flared base is good for butt play. Tantus and Fun Factory make some high quality toys which play well with my lube and Tantus has some really good deals in their grab bagclearance section.,lgbtsex,cjigroa,3,t5_2sk5b

2418752,0,t1_cmab62x,From my elementary understanding of it there are other more minor chemicals many doctors dont know of or follow that can be manipulated by hormonal changes. Hormonal changes caused by conditions can lead a marked change in the bodies responses to things for a long duration or even permanently. Its taken me  years to feel normal again. Im not sure if it has to do with how the hormones manipulate the nervous system or what. Though the saying is everything psychological is also biological. Though I think what your looking for is a cuddle buddy. While there is a major hookup culture in the gay community there is an equally if not larger cuddle culture. See Bears  They go both ways. I enjoy a small circle of friends that I legitimately love and care for like a companion. We share interests all the time. Could we have sex? Maybe but thats not a priority not really even something that comes up. If one of them left my life it would hurt as bad if not worse than a breakup. Its almost like an extended family.So maybe finding a circle of friends who understands love isnt just whats down below may be best for you right now. Its just the hetero community isnt very open to the snuggling part because thats gay. Though more guys are not caring about that now and caring for their gay friends as much as their girlfriends. Girls are open to it to but most are afraid that your seeking sex so that may be harder to convince. Unless you convince them your gay then they will cuddle away. Though that could lead to complicated problems if you decide you love both teams.Human connection is what we all need in this world and it starts with a hug and saying I see you.  ,lgbtsex,cmao0b1,1,t5_2sk5b

3808732,0,t3_3257q0,Order some quality silicone toys in different sizes.  I recommend various Vixen products via Babeland.   I would start with something a little larger than a finger right off and get used to toying yourself with that. Also do not be surprised to discover that however much you like toys  even really big toys  that  a man isnt your cuppa.,lgbtsex,cqqfc3m,1,t5_2sk5b

4491274,0,t1_cswq6h7,BostonTentacleParty  I know Im sorta hijacking StonedLeprechauns post but how do you use the PureWand?  Ive been curious about that but it seems very intimidating to me.  The stainless part and size seems like you would want to be very soft and gentle with it.  Guess Im asking do you just slowly use it?StonedLeprechaun  the rest of the posters here have given great advice.  I have found for me using warm water to clean out a bit a half hour to hour before hand helps reduce the amount that comes out.  Having said that Boston is  in suggesting to you use condoms gloves and towel.  Those are musts.,lgbtsex,cswsaq4,2,t5_2sk5b

6606240,0,t1_d02mta0,Edited. I had two things I was going to say and combined them. lol Ive seen very few guys that are larger than me in person. Generally I topped more because I thought it was more masculine and I was larger. But over time I learned that was limiting and I like giving AND getting. And sometimes I like one or the other more. Right now I like getting more. Its fluid.The bottom is most definitely NOT submissive by default. A bottom can be the dominant one in any session for sure. So thats another thing you can let go over time so you can enjoy it without stereotypes stopping you from enjoying.,lgbtsex,d02n2f3,1,t5_2sk5b

7578882,0,t3_4j1l9o,i once had it where when i first did a bit of anal like beginner stuff i had random cuts around there and vag btw female if it is anything like that moisturize and keep it clean be careful when going to the bathroom. I had that problem for about a year and saw  different doctors and they had no idea what it was. I did try to see if it was hemorrhoid. I think keeping that area not dry really helped it out. Now that I no longer have this problem i can do anal again but I am not pushing myself at all this time. I really hope you feel better soon.,lgbtsex,d33ol2c,1,t5_2sk5b
8088371,0,t1_d4p611a,Its not like what everybody thinks. If you cant get it into your mouth and its too big for your booty to receive its like All dressed up with no place to go. Especially if a big cock is attached to a jerk A number of women have told me that beyond a certain point size can be a detriment and not an asset. I guess it comes down to bragging rights! ,lgbtsex,d4p7gjr,2,t5_2sk5b
