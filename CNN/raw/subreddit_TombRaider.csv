The whole shipwreck island thing is not super original but it was well done and aside from Laura figuring the mystery out a little slowly I enjoyed the pacing.I think the I hate tombs line is innocuous. It was a reboot origin story and I dont think Laura would say the same post game as at that halfway point...do you?Beyond that my main complaint is that the game lost the survival element to quickly. Its not long before you have ammo out the ass and can decimate an army of surprisingly well armed survivors.  ,TombRaider,cljylva,7,t5_2sk5x

I know that you can go back to Syria later but because it was a small area I thought it would be best to do it all at once. Especially with having to redo Syria I felt it would be best to rerecord what I had played already.
