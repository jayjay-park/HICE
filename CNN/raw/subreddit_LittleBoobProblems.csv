10231609,0,t3_5mdmvh,People dont overlook your small breasts even if you have other stuff to make up for it ex hips butt. All it does is make you look frumpier in the eyes of society. ,LittleBoobProblems,dc3t6ew,10,t5_3i668
10263919,0,t1_dc5tnem,if you see any comments here which you feel are derailing of LBP in the way that you describe please just report them so that the LBP mods can ask exercise active moderation eg by asking for the offending part to be removed before the postcomment is unhidden. we plan to be more active than SBP was in this regard.hopefully that is a courtesy which we can then expect the mods of other subs to extend to us by modding similar comments on their subs.,LittleBoobProblems,dc7gyxj,2,t5_3i668
10333901,0,t3_5mdmvh,With  billion people on the planet body type runs the complete range on every body attribute.  Maybe someday people will care more about the person than how they look or what they wear.  Till then just remember if you think someone might not like your breasts then thankfully they wont be interested.  No one is perfect.  Breasts have very little to do with how much fun you are or interesting or nice or smart or caring or compassionate or generous and those are far more important.,LittleBoobProblems,dcfelll,3,t5_3i668
10390739,0,t3_5ojr78,I really value her honesty about this. I cant blame her for caving to the pressures of the media that come withe being a celebrity. The freaking Daily Mail for crying out loud will make a full page article on smudged eyeliner. Oh no! SoandSo is really letting herself go NOW!But heres a progression of her before with and after implants. Large breasts didnt make her more beautiful or sexy imo. If anything they looked severe and like her poor breast tissue would split open at any minute. But even if some thought the implants were necessary to look like all the other celebs implants didnt make her happier and thats most important. When I see a woman I want to know if shes happy. If so what does the rest matter? ,LittleBoobProblems,dclutfv,7,t5_3i668
10661773,0,t1_ddetbtt,I agree I dont think its wrong to have a preference at all. I just think its easy for conversations about it online to feel alienating and gross. Thats why men on Reddit saying I love little tits they dont sag doesnt encourage me it feels kinda demeaning. If it helps other women then cool but I personally dont want to hear it.,LittleBoobProblems,ddfoilw,1,t5_3i668
11093491,1,t3_5ye324,Stumbled onto this sub and yours just happened to be the first post here. Not sure if you want a mans advice but you seriously dont need to have boobs or bum. I dont know your relationship status but if youre worried about never finding someone as you dont have a bum thats not the case. Yeah those features are certainly desirable for many men and women also feel like they arent sexy without them but people also find flat shapes desirable. How boring would the world be if everyone was the same?If you do feel like you want to change though dont worry building a bum is very doable. Although youll hear you just need to squat! Squat! Squat! That isnt the case although they are involved. There are looaadds of other exercises you can do and should do that all work your lower body differently and will provide and even toned allround well built bum. Doing one exercise over and over isnt going to help anything and youll see poor results and youll lose motivation and stop. It would also be very boring. You can easily find good workout routines you can follow along with that are more interactive fun and will provide better results than just squatting and hoping a bum magically appears. Hope i helped,LittleBoobProblems,depfqzz,-1,t5_3i668
