10249269,0,t3_5mqr64,Good idea! I always struggle to come up with snack ideas because Im allergic to nuts and a bunch of raw fruits and veggies which is super annoying. My favourite easy snack might be raspberries and blueberries. I buy those little plastic trays of fresh berries which are expensive but not really that expensive compared to the snacks and candy they replace. Im also a firm believer in making room for unhealthy snacks in the calorie budget when I really crave them.When I need a loweffort dinner I often turn to frozen spring rolls that I cook in the oven and cut up some salad. Theyre usually surprisingly low in calories and quite tasty feels like comfort food almost. I feel like there are others too but I cant think of them right now.Oh and sometimes if its like  or PM and I know Im going to bed in a couple of hours but Im really craving something Ill just brush my teeth early. It doesnt remove the cravings but I hate brushing my teeth so much that I dont want to redo it so my will power increases p,Team_Phoenix,dc5t7lg,5,t5_3i6wz
10249604,0,t3_5mqr64,My tipI eat when I am bored. I have noticed that cutting up iceberg lettuce into potato chip sized bites works as a pretty good alternative to chipspopcorn. When I am bored I just want something for my mouth to do and iceberg lettuce is low calorie and quick. Personally I even like the taste but I think you could just season it if you have an aversion to raw veggies.,Team_Phoenix,dc5uks9,4,t5_3i6wz

I know Ive got to see something soon how could I be averaging an hour a day x a week averaging  calsday total not net and not be losing fat?  Gritting my teeth and pushing on. ,Team_Phoenix,dcic9hn,2,t5_3i6wz

10467358,0,t3_5pvrbg,I know what to do and Ive done a lot of it it never gets easier. It never feels natural. I dont have any sense Ive changed as a person to be a better version of myself. Its just struggle and struggle with more sadness. Making hard choices while not feeling it makes the choice harder makes me feel worse make the choice harder makes me feel worse... Ad infinitum... and I copy pasted this from the loseit Daily thread ,Team_Phoenix,dcukygh,1,t5_3i6wz
