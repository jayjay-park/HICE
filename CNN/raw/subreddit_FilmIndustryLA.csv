263356,0,t1_cf81rup,Ive heard that plenty too which Ive taken note to not work for free for anyone. The old dogs are worried about maintaining industry standards and fair pay because theyre comfortable where they are. And all the new guys in town are feverishly grabbing whatever job they can scrape from craigslist or hear about online for  a day because they dont want to run out of money before they even get started here and LA being a scaryass lonely place doesnt help either.,FilmIndustryLA,cf820z1,2,t5_2sno0

1237842,0,t3_28885i,I love overnights. My tipsLike others said flip your schedule. Ive learned it takes two full days for me to do this. YMMV.Bring extra caffeine in whatever form. I once came to a night shoot and they didnt have coffee or soda or energy drinks. I made them go and get some. WHAT THE FUCK WERE THEY THINKING? Dont assume youll be working with amateurs but be prepared for it.Bring an extra clothing layer. It can get cold at night especially if youre used to just working during the hot day doing exteriors. My night shoots are almost all exteriors and if youre near he coast youll want an extra long sleeve shirt or jacket.Have the wrap party at am or whenever you break at the end of it. It will rule and youll all be delirious but its fun.,FilmIndustryLA,ci8vgij,2,t5_2sno0
1564071,0,t1_cjcbkor,professionalMy current job is producing television. When I want professionals I call the line producer and we hire professionals. I know how professional production works. Anyone can spend  seconds on this sub and know its not professional. Maybe you are delusional about your status but I have a different standard. Professionals arent on message boards with film contests listings questions about agencies and day Art Director ads.The ego on you people...I want a young guy because I think young people do cooler stuff. I am posting casually because this is for my own personal work not broadcast television.Have fun making it in showbiz!,FilmIndustryLA,cjcbuvl,-1,t5_2sno0
1768299,0,t3_2eq55u,I was an Adult Swim intern.The best thing that got me not just in the door but through the interview was understanding my place as an intern discussing things thoughtfully and with my own opinion and demonstrating a capacity for strong resourcefulness.My real stand out moment was when the process had me interviewed by Kieth Crawford exec producer of AS he does the shakedown interview to see how people stand under pressure. I was given an opening to discuss the transition AS was doing in  from animation to live action. I actually questioned the decision as being offbrand.Man. I was torn a new one by the Executive Producer of Adult Swim. But I got the gig. Found out later a big part of it was because I actually asked a controversial thing to the Exec rather than gladhanding too much.I also did the deep research on the people working at AS. Let me keep control of the lulls in the conversation by bringing up little things I knew the people in the process could speak to.My resume was also pretty reasonable for the context...but instead of gimmicks. Which do have their place and time like a bribe from one department to another Id focus on showing off skills that would make you a workplace asset. Think about  key things you can do no other asshole on the planet can do for them...and then sell the shit out of that.Then again you made it this far. Maybe all your instincts are right. Only you know for sure.,FilmIndustryLA,ck21t3k,2,t5_2sno0

2071720,0,t1_cl31i4l,A lot of what youve been saying has been very confrontational and entitled. And I think as somebody mentioned theres a lot of people out there wanting work no matter if they have connections or not. So just offer to be positive do whatever it takes and someone who is selfmotivated and it should go a long way.Note though theres a rough line there about having a gogetter attitude in interviews. When we interview folks and they say that with almost too aggressively thats a big turn off for us. We want someone who gets shit done but also isnt just saying that because they have to. Authenticity is hard to convey in interviews.,FilmIndustryLA,cl35t9b,3,t5_2sno0

3288641,0,t3_2xt3ya,In the last two years Ive seen  different production houses switching from FCP to Premier. There were hurdles for sure but for the most part the switch was pretty easy and seamless. Ive heard of far more teams switching to Premier instead of Avid. And I havent met any professionals that can say the company that they work for switched to FCP X... single freelance editors? Sure. But a team of editors? Nope.I should add that my experience is pretty limited to television. Almost everyone I know works in TV not movies. Ive heard FCP X has done better in movies but I dont know how much.Its a really interesting landscape these days. Ive always been a supporter of Adobe personally.,FilmIndustryLA,cp34qqp,4,t5_2sno0
3311430,0,t3_2y2b35,First you have to have a specific goal. Because of unions youre going to have to choose one thing you want to do and stick to it to even be considered.Also your education means absolutely nothing in this industry.

4032026,0,t3_36odox,Im wondering how this works with production companies. Seems like every movie Ive worked on is done through an LLC specifically set up for that particular movie.

4651420,0,t1_ctgukdl,Haha cool Im glad it was easily rectified.I only mention talking to production because thats one of my biggest gripes on set. Some people get really passive aggressive and never tell us about issues or problems. Like I dont find out til the last week of the shoot that people want more apples at crafty or that someone was upset because they felt underpaid for what their responsibilities were. Some issues more than others are easily fixed with a simple conversation. Production is there to make sure everyone has their proper resources and that everyone is taken care of. So I hate when people feel like theyve been burned by the LP or PM.,FilmIndustryLA,ctgvfis,1,t5_2sno0

6140706,0,t3_3zkti5,There are a lot of variables here. It depends on how much you make how much risk you have what financing you require hiring and other things a good lawyer is a great help in this.As some general rules.Start as a sole proprietorship. This offers you no protections but also minimal costs and no additional taxes.LLC is one option a lot of people like. It offers some protections makes business financing easier hiring a lot cleaner. Downside it costs money bigger downside is that many lawsuits pass right through the protection so you personally would still have a lot of risk.LP and LLP are something that film makers probably wont consider but an LP is very useful for film investors.Actual incorporation. This offers the best protections to you. Corporation pays taxes itself then it pays a salary and dividend to you which you then pay taxes on. You can rather easily have  taxation. The reason for this is that if something happens the corp is sued and assuming you have actually followed the laws around corporate governance then it is almost impossible for the suit to come to you as a person. There is also debate between S and C corps.Before going through any of this get a real lawyer have the real consequences explained to you.,FilmIndustryLA,cynmu1w,2,t5_2sno0

10958022,0,t1_dea6igv,Not sure if youve ever been on set but if you havent you should do extra work some to get a feel for the pace. Then try to PA. No one will want you on set if youve never been and extra work is more forgiving. Once you get familiar with set life PAing you can try and move into other departments. What do you want todo with your life? If youre a logistics and people person maybe producing is for you if youre technical maybe camera. If you like blue collar work maybe gripping. If youre a computer guym or girl maybe post. You can PA for all those departments thought you probably arent qualified or you wouldnt be asking how to get in the credits. Your best bet for PA work is the smallest of small time stuff on Craigslist and Facebook. ,FilmIndustryLA,dea8pzg,1,t5_2sno0

11786411,0,t3_685f42,Not a silly question at all! Youre usually paid a  hour day rate of  and any time worked over those  hours will add overtime. Commercials pay  but its usually a  hour day rate. These rate will jump in July when minimum wage rises in LA again. Rates vary depending on the budget of the project and if it is a union gig vs. someones independent project. Hours can vary daily depending on the project overnights early mornings etc and can be a tad unpredictable as to when you get to leave. They usually work on scheduling the day before. On the rare occasion you get to leave set early youre still payed the full  hour day. Weekends are not very common as it cost more to keep talent and crew members on set but if a weekend shoots happens youll still only work  days per week as a th day would all be overtime. ,FilmIndustryLA,dgw11t6,3,t5_2sno0
