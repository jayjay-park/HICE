3083236,0,t1_cohkak4,I definitely recommend giving it a try though its fairly difficult. This one is for the NDS though a few of the Etrian Odyssey titles are DS only. III is pretty much the best starting point in my opinion as well. The other battle themes are pretty great as well. And yes thats one battle theme per word.,nintendomusic,cohkqt7,1,t5_2zrp4

3443321,0,t3_2zluml,The credits theme from Pokemon RSE. Interesting story as a kid I used to have the volume muted during the credits because well credits. The first time I completed the Hoenn Pokedex I got the last one to evolve after the Champion battle. That time I didnt mute the credits music.

5118060,0,t3_3l33tb,Snow Land  Kirbys Epic Yarn I linked to a playlist with several other songs that may fit your description from  to  all from Epic Yarn.Valley of Repose  Pikmin  and its Nintendo Land counterpart This one is a little quirky especially the NL version. There is also a Louie version but that one is the only shitty Louie song in all of Pikmin .Freezeezy Peak  BanjoKazooie This one is the piece de resistance the winter song to end all winter songs. It was arranged and performed by an orchestra and included as part of the Banjo Land Medley in BanjoKazooie Nuts amp Bolts. And again And again Theres an obvious reason for that and its that this is one of the greatest songs in video game history.I hope these help!,nintendomusic,cv2x1xk,1,t5_2zrp4
