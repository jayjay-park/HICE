6449879,0,t1_czmg5p4,Ive read the above posts but i have yet to have a problem with someone hipfiring me and getting a lucky headshot at  yards. If anything the only time ive gotten headshot by hipfire would be getting dinked by a shieldbro which doesnt make me all that mad because it just means that they outplayed me. I dont think spray and pray is meta at all it seems like an ads burst about  shots aimed at the opponents throat is the way to go so if they move along the z axis you still have a chance to hit them. With the v situation im not saying i would have done any better but do you honestly expect to win a v shootout? Unless you are significantly better than both players or have a severe advantage positioning or something you are probably going to lose that gunfight or trade out for. I mean... welcome to all competitive videogames ever? I get that it sucks that you feel like you didnt even have a chance to fight back but if you traded for then thats probably the best you can hope for in that situation unless you can seriously outplay your opponents. ,RainbowSixSiege,czmghx1,-1,t5_324do
6449958,0,t1_czmgnjy,There will always be an aspect of timing that is just unlucky like you break a barricade just as an opponent happens to walk past but you could also try different positioning. Dont sit in a corner that they can turn and prefire. Dont sit where theyd expect you. If you think theyve seen you move. The problem with fps games is something called peekers advantage which is a lag in the netcode that favors the person rounding the corner not the stationary person. ,RainbowSixSiege,czmgsk4,-1,t5_324do

As a warning to the Attackers it would make beeps when set up somewhat like the Nitro Cells do but a different distinguishable noise.

6833664,0,t3_49bmwk,Im not entirely sure about ... Yes it would be a good idea that increases Tuchankas playability but he already has the deployable shield. Yes it limits Tuchankas already reduced visibility on the turret but it isnt something that hinders performance if the player is skilled with Tuchanka. Also I fear that a shield mounting in the turret will only hinder Tuchanka because it either A. has to be big enough to cover his body sufficiently or B. wouldnt be effective at all because attacking players can easily shoot his lower body. With the time to kill ridiculously fast as it is right now killing a player by shooting them in the feet isnt hard at all. I disagree with  because adding a variable like that would favor heavily towards the defenders however I do agree on more cameras. Something else I dont really agree on would be  only because Ive found that wl kd ratio rank and level dont accurately portray the skill level of a player. Ive seen Diamonds make rookie mistakes frequently and Coppers ace a team of Golds. Some others I dont agree with have already been mentioned so no point in beating a dead horse.,RainbowSixSiege,d0qwawu,1,t5_324do

Also people using  FoV have bigger targets than people using a higher FoV. Then you have the guns... Being accurate with a shotgun isnt difficult you have a big margin for error.

8762612,0,t1_d70xsoq,I do think some alternative reward strategies for the losing team may be worth looking into. Off the top of my head something like the top two players of the losing team gain a small amount of rating instead of losing rating should their score for the match end up above a certain threshold per round played. Far from a perfect idea since it still in a way promotes kd over winning but its something Ive been mulling over in my head since Ive been having a difficult time getting back to even my rank from last season.,RainbowSixSiege,d70zkl3,1,t5_324do

Now it doesnt have friendly AI cause your suppose to work together with your teammates and commanding them the way you would the AI. But most people dont play like that cause they try to lone wolf it. The only games that didnt really feel like a true R game was the Vegas series.

I want to say your CPU is taking a bit to run at full speed.  Just checking  is you laptop running in performance mode in your power settings? If that didnt work then maybe look up unparking CPU cores.  I dont have the link on hand but a quick search should find you the program. . You might try changing to borderless windowfullscreen mode in your games display settings.  That should make alttab easier and faster. ,RainbowSixSiege,dafjf88,1,t5_324do
