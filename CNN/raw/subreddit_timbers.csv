150024,0,t3_1vsl5q,I dont think any of the recent signing is going to spell the end of Kalif. KA is one of the few players that can be first off the bench for either Valeri or Nagbe. I dont see him on the left very often so the Zakuani or the drafting of Tshuma wont hurt him especially. But I do think that this will have to be his year to claim a prominent role.if the Timbers go deep in the USOpen Cup this year August becomes a logjam of matches due to CCL group stages kicking off. There is plenty of opportunity to show off your skills. If KA can do well but not break into the starting XI I am sure PTFC will find someone to deal him to. He is only . There is still a chance that KA hasnt peaked. And I really think it is mental. He just makes so many bad decisions. As we saw with AJB GW and Porter have no problems parting with good talent that makes poor decisions. ,timbers,ceviohu,6,t5_2s2lj

He may also start beneath Urruti or Piquionne in a  sometimes.I dont think Valeri Urruti or Fernandez are best utilized wide. Valeri isnt fast or physical enough. Urruti is better at applying pressure across the top and making slashing runs. Fernandez is best in the middle in traffic. Zakuani can play fast and wide to give us muchneeded width with Nagbe and Alhassan tending to drift inside and Jewsbury not getting far forward. Look for Powell to gradually replace Jewsbury.Edit if Porter has the forwards and midfielders interchanging Fernandez and Valeri could play wide as they switch positions with other players.

Its too early to make assumptions about what he can and cannot do because I doubt we have seen all that he is capable of.

MLS teams are more likely to look for players out of favor or out of contract that sort of thing.

But thats just my speculation.From an ESPN piece on RJgtJohnson earned about  double his MLS salary listed at  by the MLS Players Union in  when he moved from the Timbers to China last year helping newly promoted club Henan Jianye based in the city of Zhengzhou remain in the first division. Avoiding relegation on the final day of the season the club finished just a point above the two clubs that suffered the drop. Johnson decided to take a slight pay cut to accept a twoyear contract in South Korea but will still earn significantly more than his MLS salary according to agent Patrick McCabe.He made DOUBLE what PTFC paid him when he left. I really think he knew what his contribution was to that insane  run and was trying to leverage it for all it was worth knowing he was what  years old? Honestly he wasnt an amazing pure striker but his work rate and ability to stretch back lines out did create chances and goals during the  season. And at k he was an absolute steal.Oh and weird MLS related fact hes playing in the same league as former MLS ROY Austin Berry.

He has been locking down his side.  Interesting that he was in on the beginning of the squabble today ... when interviewed this week he said he thinks he can bring a tougher edge to Portland I believe he said we were too nice! and this play may be evidence of his intent.Still feeling good about a lot of starters Valeri as usual Nagbe good to have you back! our two wingers Melano and Asprilla have been exciting every time out this year and this bodes unbelievably well for this year.

So thats good I guess.I feel like this is being done for financial reasons. We simply are getting not our moneys worth. He is our third highest paid player I believe but I wouldnt put him in our top three performers. Besides the playoffs last year he has been really unimpressive. Hes a speedy winger who cannot score.I always thought he was a signing for the future.

If it was such a success why are we building away from the ?. No way were taking Valeri out of the middle so this seems to solidify that Nagbe is not in the plans for the spine.

11192346,0,t3_5zkuml,Yeah we probably will but it will be difficult enough to find one whos decent.  But I have faith in Wilkinson there are a number of Championship level defenders that could probably work well.  I sure as shit would stay away from a relegated side though.  Look at Taylor he didnt give a shit.,timbers,df0n0vm,1,t5_2s2lj

11226066,0,t3_608g3x,Just got home from Tonys well got home put in a pizza and am now online. Heres what the pub was talking about Guzman was barking orders at everyone on the field. Dude is trying to organize that back line with so many starters out. Blanco played amazing on his own but is still trying to find chemistry with the team. Ceiling is high. Chara with Guzman managing the back has been free to wander upthough he should likely do it more than he has been. Houston whines and showboated and if theres any proof that theres justice in the universe its the final scoreline. Allen Chapman is bald shit and resembles a phallus.,timbers,df4gkyp,7,t5_2s2lj

11247265,0,t1_df6kojm,Honestly to be a fly on that wall... the a human brain capable of understanding English In all seriousness though that had to have been one HELL of a team talk. We kept them to  shot in the second half and we had so much possession. Nobody was flubbing touches. Everyone was focused and committed. No need for subs! Not even an Asprilla or a Maddocks for fresh legs... Incredible performance.,timbers,df6uzvz,1,t5_2s2lj
11275036,0,t1_df9o4zn,Im as fine with this decision. As others have mentioned the Timbers had the choice to play now or play more Wednesday games later. Considering this is the best start to a season the Timbers have ever had Id say theyve bought themselves some breathing room and now we dont have to worry so much about a cramped schedule during the last half of the season.,timbers,dfa0c0l,4,t5_2s2lj

11609890,0,t3_65nk69,Literally every match thread today is packed full of complaints about the ref. Literally very match thread on rsoccer is packed full of complaints about the ref. The ref is a condition like the rain and the snow and the turf and the grass. The ref did not prevent us from finishing the chances that we missed. I hate bad reffing. This ref was bad. This ref missed a lot of calls. The ref is always bad. The ref always misses a lot of calls. The same ref will have a good day and not miss a lot of calls and will still be a bad ref that misses a lot of calls. The same ref missed a bunch of calls against SKC which in a complex web of cause and effect could have led to goals for them too. Its completely unproductive to say we lost the game because of the ref. I am not going to go into the wings of a butterfly creating a hurricane because like as not the wings of the butterfly never create a hurricane. Its just that its a hell of a lot more complex than that. Let me repeat I hate bad reffing. This ref was bad. This ref missed a lot of calls.,timbers,dgbzp1q,8,t5_2s2lj
