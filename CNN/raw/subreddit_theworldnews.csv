10391233,0,t3_5oqxu6,Dont be fooled into thinking AfD is some aberration all German political parties generally are against paying true dollar compensation and against Germany facing the true repercussions they should have for their vast crimes against humanity including genocide and very gleeful that such a a European war criminal state built on genocide and wars of aggression is today Europes most dominant power economically because of all the dirty deeds of the past which they materially benefited from but never were punished for in true measure. Germany is generally very successful in branding itself to the world in a way that supports German interests and hiding what is really going on in Germany domestically and how aggressive German policy really is. Most Westerners tend to thus falsely believe that Germans have bent over backwards to deNazify to pay reparations to Jewish victims to pay reparations to victim states. When in reality Germany massively benefited and eventually became the victor of WWII as the dominant European economic power and hegemon in the EU bureaucracy. Remember they invented the Clausewitzian conception of war as a continuation of politics  gtThe USA and UK imposed the rehabilitation of West Germany on their alliesclient states including Israel. If it were up to Jewish and European popular opinion probably the righteous Morgenthau Plan would have been implemented that would have forced Germany to deindustrialize and become a discredited agricultural backwater pariah state that wouldnt have been able to destroy Europe with its infiltration of the European Union. Plus newly independent Israel was economically weak and regionally isolated and desperately needed any type of reparations it could get from Germany to help build the Israeli economy. This bought silence from Israel regarding Germany dirty deeds miserly reparations and fake denazification efforts. Even as late as the s Nazi scientists worked for the Egyptian missile program and were killed by Mossad. West Germany had a massive continuity with Nazi officials never leaving office and just transitioning seamlesslygtgtBetween  and   of the West German Justice Ministrys  leading judges and lawyers were former members of the Nazi party according to the government report.gtThere was very large continuity former Justice Minister Sabine LeutheusserSchnarrenberger  who had commissioned the study while in office  told broadcaster Deutschlandfunk on Monday.gtOf those   had been members of the Nazi partys original paramilitary SA group which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power and participated in the bloody Night of the Broken Glass also known as Kristallnacht that killed an estimated  Jewish people.gtIn  alone  percent of senior ministry officials were former members of Hitlers party a higher proportion even than during the  Third Reich the study found.Through  Germany only paid  billion in compensation Jewish victims    Which means despite the massive whining of Germans of how they bend over backwards to make amends they actually took more just in physical assets from Jews than they ever paid back! So forgot about compensation for pain and suffering from such a chauvinist and aggressive people. See   gt   gtLess than  percent of the value of Jewish assets stolen by the Nazis and their collaborators has been restored. At least  billion  prices remains unreturned despite numerous clear and explicit international agreements and country promises made during World War II and immediately thereafter. Even the highly publicized resurgence of restitution efforts since the mids resulted in the return of only  percent of Holocaust property.gt...gtIn lates prices the value of Jewish assets amounted to  billion. .... gtIn todays prices  the value of these Jewish assets would be some  billion.Nazi Germany looted so much just from Jews it is estimated that they funded rd of their war effort with the plunder     gtToday in the fake reformed but still chauvinist as ever Germany Germans are increasingly considering themselves as victimssic of the Nazi regime!
