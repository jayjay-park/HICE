3271587,0,t1_coup6fq,I agree with this. When I started a couple of years ago I thought the convention cards were silly. My cousin who is a serious poker player now learning bridge just cant understand why bridge players dont bluff. Now that I know a little more I check other folks cards more often. It is less important in a small club where you will soon learn what systems other folks play but when you go elsewhere looking over peoples cards is essential. ,bridge,cp16rcb,1,t5_2rdnb

3827869,0,t3_348odq,Hi there! Im  and an avid bridge player. Last summer I went to the Junior World Championships on the USA u team and I can tell you that worldwide the game is far from dead. Even in the US if you go to large tournaments you will see a few young faces. I also started a bridge club at my college. Young people are interested in the game it just takes an outlet to learn it. Several colleges do have bridge clubs though particularly the most academic ones.,bridge,cqslxsu,2,t5_2rdnb
5412047,0,t3_3ouy59,its really not the same game without doubling and vulnerability and neither of those are too complicated once youre used to it.bonuses for making games and slams take care of the problem that you are describing theres definitely an incentive to bid as high as possible in bridge.you might try chicago scoring if you find rubber scoring too tricky to remember.,bridge,cw3g5k9,2,t5_2rdnb
6397863,0,t1_czgv658, tricks is just over half the tricks. To take them reliably in NT you have to have half the points   points or so. Yet NT needs  to  points. So you see that each extra trick after the first  only takes around . to  points. Having a  card trump suit fit is also worth at least one trick. So . to  to make  of a minor.  to  to make  of a major. and  to  to make NT.,bridge,czgvdk8,5,t5_2rdnb
6924106,0,t3_4aj2nq,Bidding H is weak and competitive a jump to H looks like signoff and Id take X to show spades and to suggest no heart fit. So Id bid C to show the hearts and partner should be able to reason that I have extras because I didnt just bid H right away on the Principle of Fast Arrival. If partner weakly signs off in H we have a tricky problem slam will require partner to have the AK of hearts I assume were missing the Ace of clubs and  winners in the other suits. Its not out of the question but it seems unlikely. Partner needs something like this for the slamKQx  AKxxx  xx  xxxor thisx  AKxxx Jxxx QJxIf were missing the ace or king of hearts were down probably an opponent with a singleton king of hearts could still let us make the slam. If partner has the queen but not the king of spades were probably down. Same if she has the jack but not the queen of clubs or fewer than  diamonds. The important thing to find out is not keycards but spot cards. If you werent using kickback RKCB Id cuebid S over H as a helpsuit slam try hoping partner might have the kingqueenthird and get excited. but since you are using kickback I dont see any useful bid. Id trust partner she signed off in H because even knowing you have slam interest from your C bid she wasnt interested. If you make an overtrick so be it.,bridge,d11670h,2,t5_2rdnb
7592907,0,t1_d30il8e,Agree wholeheartely. Other than losing established partnerships due to multiple moves the constant dumbing down is the biggest reason I stopped playing bridge. Not only were perfectly reasonable methods either disallowed or severely restricted can only play in team events with a certain minimum number of boards per round these decisions were not carried out in a equitable way. A forcing NT over a M opener is more difficult to defend than an undisciplined weak two AND the likelihood of MI is much higher for the forcing NT.Say try to squeeze out of them under which circumstances the forcing NT hand might contain three card support.,bridge,d359x8m,3,t5_2rdnb
