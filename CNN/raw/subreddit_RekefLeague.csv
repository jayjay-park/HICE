10636030,0,t1_ddcyjau,Just because your opponent does not try to contact you doesnt make it okay to also not try to make it happen yourself. Being busy is one thing but just doing the minimal thing of posting in this thread to try and get a match set up takes  minute.We will put this at a draw because there is no other option and you were both at fault here.I will not just kick you for one mistake but I expect a bit more in the future. Just try and schedule your matches it cant be that hard.,RekefLeague,ddd0wuj,2,t5_3fwaf
