4668623,0,t1_ctizsgr,So if  is my stunt and having a  stunt roll would be really good? What does that mean a degree of success? What would be the point if I rolled a   and a  S? Or if I make the TN and have a high stunt roll then I can describe how I lifted the boulder valiantly? Possibly get a girls number from saving her life too?,FantasyAGE,ctj17df,1,t5_397ht

7096613,0,t3_40tfuo,Just an odd thought  what if you took a tablet wwhichever d gaming tool you prefer for mapsencounters  then used a simple overhead projector  would let you adjust things relatively easily let the players and audience see them thanks to the projector  or grab up one of those tablet projector kits about  USD and broadcast the digital map up to TVs in the room  shrug Just spit balling but maybe those could work  Ive done the electronic version broadcasting the tablet up to a flat screen and giving my pcs a cheap couple laser pointers and used that in place of a tabletop map since wed been spread across a large space  so yeah perhaps it could work with your setup too,FantasyAGE,d1krrsu,1,t5_397ht
7613780,0,t3_4jkup5,I am the GM of the Age of Runark podcast you can find us here   is you want to see how it plays out.I like the system a lot so far I have two brand new players to tabletop so the system was easy for them to learn and they are slowly starting to master it. I think the system covers enough to run the games and have fun.  I do wish there was some more rules to cover situations but it is easy enough to come up with something on the fly.  I think it will come down to the stunt system and how well your group likes them.  I think the stunt are really fun and can change a battle or situation pretty quickly.The monsters are the hardest thing about the system.  So far there isnt a ton of direction when it comes to building combats.  lower levels they suggest throwing  minor threat enemy per player.  Coming from Dungeon World I think it can allow for the creativity of the system the trickiest part would be combat. To come from a system where you get to lay out your attack flair and all to the Fantasy AGE system which is more structured Major amp Minor action it may be a tough sell to your players if they havent experienced it before.,FantasyAGE,d37nb1s,5,t5_397ht

8549712,0,t1_d69s0k9,Its common rarity and the book does say common magic items could be found for sale... What would you price this at?,FantasyAGE,d6aab60,1,t5_397ht
8929943,0,t1_d7k88zy,Stars Without Number is what I would use for my scifi setting if I gave on on trying to convert FAGE.  I would definately use a lot of the information from it at the least.,FantasyAGE,d7l8x20,2,t5_397ht
9483395,0,t3_5anetd,I think these questions are all heavy DM and setting dependant. Its hard to set a baseline for this.How often do you get rewards and what kind of rewards did you get?A low magic setting will not have a lot of magical gear just laying around or in shops. Ask your DM about his and the partys expectations.About the book prices yeah g is a lot for a blank book. But in a medieval setting books are rare and handcrafted and valuable. I would say if you find the right buyer for it you could get a decent amount of money. But a random innkeeper probably wouldnt pay much for Brief History of the Empire v. Something he probably cant even read.,FantasyAGE,d9i16i5,3,t5_397ht
