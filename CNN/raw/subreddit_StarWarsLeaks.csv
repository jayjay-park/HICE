3707220,0,t3_32uwo5,I was going to make a similar post. Here are the shots from the trailer that legitimize himFirst shot of the trailer the crashed Star Destroyer. Prior to the panel we learned Rey was a scavenger and a loner living alone on the desert planet which MSW has always maintained is not Tatooine until she meets BB. Shes a solitary scavenger who is thrust into the action upon meeting the aforementioned droid. MSW reported exactly thatThe third shot of the trailer is probably Luke and Artoo. This could absolutely be this  flashback MSW described as it looks to be the fallout of some sort of action.Later we see Kylo Ren with the Flametroopers. Before the panel we learned from Oscar Isaac that Poe Dameron is sent by Leia on a mission that brings him to meet Finn. MSW has previously reported that Leia had sent Poe on a mission to retrieve the Lukes original lightsaber which was confirmed in the trailer to have some significance. Here  is MSWs description of the films opening and its continued here  This all fits perfectly with what Isaac told us about his character as well as the TIE fighter fucking shit up in the Star Destroyers hangar.After this we see Boyega ripping his helmet off. Check out a still of his mask  a bloody hand. In addition to MSWs report that Finns friend dies early in the film he also reported that Finns friend leaves a bloody handprint on his mask.Later we see the Falcon being chased by TIE fighters flying through a downed ship. Heres an excerpt from one of MSWs reports the first I linked The Falcon is chased by TIE Fighters and we apparently move by some familiar landmarks in the films onesun desert setting. As TIEs shoot at the Falcon Rey has to ask Finn if he plans on answering back. Its a situation he cant talk himself out of and he has figure out how to use the turret and actually hit one. To save their skins Rey pilots them into the insides of the giant crashed Star Destroyer she was scavenging from during her introduction sequence. The Falcon and the TIEs slalom around debris and the insides of the downed ship eventually losing their persuers. This is pretty much dead on.The last shot of the trailer implies that Han is returning to the Falcon. MSW reports that when we meet Han he is separated from the FalconHow people can still want him banned as a source is beyond me. Who cares if hes a prick. This is not guesswork the guy has access to factual information. ,StarWarsLeaks,cqeujz2,25,t5_2vflj

I mean I love Mark Hamill but youre kidding yourself if you dont think there were dozens of actors who could play his role in the OT. Ahmed is a decent actor hell likely be as good in the central role as any number of other actors the point is that in most franchises him not being a typical white heartthrob would deprive him of even getting the chance to be the male lead. Evidently Lucasfilm have decided that wont happen with Star Wars and that is a truly great decision since the Star Wars universe is meant to be a diverse and multiracial place which the Empire is imposing its borderline white supremacist will onto.,StarWarsLeaks,cqmr1yp,2,t5_2vflj

3993536,0,t3_367iuf,gtThe rumors are missing something and its this whole concept.I wonder if its referencing the natural repopulation of force users being born and maturing after the Order  culling and formal Empire antiJedi policies  but having lost the multiple millennia of knowledge that was developed by the JediSith orders in how to hone strengthen and enhance Force sensitive abilities.  There could for example be a number of people a bit like Luke at the start of ESB  they can move very small objects but only with great difficulty.  They cant really do much more than parlor tricks.Because Luke was really the last Jedi actually trained by grand masters like Yoda and Kenobi he is being heavily sought by all kinds of new Force users.  And at some point theres going to be a scramble to recruit all these people to the light side of the Force before they fall to the dark or vice versa?Wherever Luke is  he knows this just like Serkis character felt it  and its what causes him to come out of isolation  setting the build up for the later movies?,StarWarsLeaks,crbhvut,6,t5_2vflj

In fact there already are quite a few on the JCF they just get constantly bullied into submission and silence by the other douchebags. I have valid justifiable opinions for disliking the rumors. None of you fucks have any good reasons for defending all this shittiness other than to be pretentious assholes If anything you guys like to be contrarian to feel superior and important hence all the BS on the JCF like I hope that all the original trilogy characters die horribly bc itll be better character development! I hope this movie is a gritty violent realistic rrated war movie that doesnt treat it like a game! I hope Luke Skywalker isnt in ANY of the new Star Wars films! I hate Luke! I hope blah blah blah blah blah blah yak yak yak bullshit bullshit bullshit. It also doesnt help that you act like dickheads who think theyre superior to everyone else by ganging up on people who disagree with the majority and inconsistently enforcing your stupid rules.

Not Star Wars.  If we get Star Wars true to the mythos and legitimately continuing the story great.  I do not expect it though.

You can make the movie be about Starfleet trying to push a war and becoming more militaristic but at least have it make sense.They could have easily carried on from the previous movie. Vulcan has been destroyed by a Romulan who claimed to be from the future. Maybe the Federation doesnt really buy it and starts becoming increasingly aggressive to the Romulan Star Empire it is about  years after a war with them and no one has really seen them since then. Until one escaped Klingon custody destroyed Vulcan and attacked Earth. Maybe the Klingons arent happy about losing a bunch of their ships and start making moves to have some sort of alliance with the Federation to deal with the Romulans. The movie could have been about the Enterprise trying to stop a war.

I couldnt imagine how he could be privy to THAT much information and not have DisneyLucasfilm actively trying to put his ass in a sling for spilling it all.  Yeah I know what you might say Shutting him up would only prove that hes telling the truth so theres no point in taking action against him but considering all the effort that was put into keeping these plot details secret having someone know that much and reveal it all to us fans should be a violation of some kind of legal agreement shouldnt it?  shrug  I dont know.. I didnt WANT to believe he was right about certain things especially the death of Han Solo.  I cringe at the thought of this happening even though I know itll have a strong emotional impact because of the dipshit Abramshaters who will pollute the internet with FUCK JJ ABRAMS HE RUINED STAR TREK AND NOW HE RUINED STAR WARS BY KILLING HAN SOLO!!!!! and other such baseless inaccurate nonsense.  Plus if Han must die I want it to be a heroic noble death.  Having him get run through by Kylo with a lightsaber doesnt strike me as a noble heroic death.  Maybe itll be better in its proper context but as it was described I was really unhappy with it.So yeah maybe he is barking up the right tree.

I do think LucasfilmDisney still want to tie trailers to movies though...they did it with Teaser . Its misguided...but Im not convinced they realize its completely unnecessary at this point.Actually...a lot of school districts do close down completely that week. Most of the ones around me do. If they drop it that week itll be on Friday morning like they did with Teaser . Too many people travel on that Wednesday night. Thanksgiving Day is for family. It would drop on Black Friday and be in theatres beginning that day. Just a guess mind...I have zero inside info.

5070938,0,t3_3kgghf,One theory I posted on a similar thread  is that after hes born Poes parents are going to join in the final fight against the empire the battle of jakku and probably die.It could work because if im not mistaken the battle of Jakku is where the rebels finally drove off the last of the empire and it took place about a year after Endor.So if Poe was conceived on the night of the battle on Endor the timeline might fit. Also if Han and Leia become close to the Damerons over the course of shattered empire it might explain Poes close relationship with Leia in TFA that and the fact that hes probably her best star fighter hence being sent on the secret mission to Jakku.Maybe Han andor Leia raised Poe for a time? Maybe Leia feels guilt over possibly being the one to send Poes family into battle in the first place and leaving their son an orphan?I dont know but what we do know is that Poe probably idolizes his parents for their role in the Rebellion and if Jakku is where they died it would make coming back there for Poe mean  more than just completing a mission...it would mean facing  his parents in a way.I think Jakku will be significant to each of the new characters. Its where Finn abandons the empire and chooses his name and its where Poe faces his familys past and its where both men meet each other for the first time kinda and become Jacket Bros LOL.,StarWarsLeaks,cux8n20,5,t5_2vflj

Finn feals threatened and springs Poe and they escape back to Jakku in a stolen Tie. They crash. Finn takes Poes Jacket wanders the desert and meets up with Rey. Rey and Finn escape Jakku in the Falcon.That seems pretty obvious from what weve officially been told and shown.

Its the fact that he is a black jedi who is front and center wielding Anakins lightsaber. He goes against what some people pictured in their heads what a main male hero in SW and this denial is how they deal with it. Im sure when the movie comes out there will be a change in attitude about John Boyega but its definitely been interesting to see how some fans have reacted to him being front and center and not Ridley or Issac. I think if he was just a side character like Mace or Lando then he wouldnt have gotten this kind of treatment.

In other words why did Jakku have any value at all to the Empire and the Rebellion to drive them from it? Why does the Empire need a planet at all? This definitely needs explaining and from what Ive seen from Lost Stars is poorly explained. Was the Rebel Alliance just wanting to kill off the remaining parts of the Empire? If so and there was no other strategic rationale to eliminate the Empire in that battle then the Alliances actions may be viewed as borderline genocidal or genocide itself particularly if they didnt offer the Empire a chance for surrender. However if the Empire mined the planet or had a formidable base or shipyard there then that could be a valid reason to strategically deprive the Empire of Jakku for its resources. But if its a dead planet only meant to be an arena for war then its a very very poor set up by lazy writers who didnt fully think through the reasons the Empire has for occupying Jakku and only conjured it up to have a battle there.,StarWarsLeaks,cwnt4om,2,t5_2vflj

5623713,0,t1_cwu5sk3,Personally I was really hoping for Brad Bird. I really loved the Iron Giant and Incredibles and Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol was a great film against my expectations. I was bummed that he chose Tomorrowland instead but in retrospect I really doubt that he would have given our GFFA the love that Abrams has.I didnt really have anything against Abrams but I was worried that his approach would be more style than substance. I loved the look of Super  and thought that he perfectly captured that sera Spielberg look and tone but the overall story was a bit underwhelming. Cloverfield was just a typical monster attack movie mashed with the alreadytired foundfootage device. Star Trek was okay but ultimately forgettable IMHO. I wasnt overly familiar with the rest of his work but I knew enough to form the opinion that hed be okay but not phenomenal. Judging on what weve seen so far I was so wrong.Thats partially why Im willing to give Trevorrow the benefit of the doubt. I think hes a fine but unremarkable filmmaker. I liked Safety Not Guaranteed and I thought that Jurassic World was fine for what it was though the last act was a bit ridiculous. I think hell do just fine with Star Wars though particularly with the third film in a trilogy. ,StarWarsLeaks,cwu6bfw,11,t5_2vflj

I feel that the only reason the original cast is back to avoid creating new characters and profit on nostalgia. We know Han Luke and Leia are back but Han dies without even seeing his old pal Luke Leia is just in a few scenes doing her job as a general of the resistance and Luke does nothing during the film. Not the best way to do things.An alternative would have been to introduce Han in the third part of the first act and he mentors Finn. Poe is mentored by Leia and Luke is introduced in the second act after Rey gets captured maybe he comes out of hiding and all three meet at the resistance base accompanying Han Finn Chewie and BB to Starkiller base to help rescue Rey.  Han would still die but we would have gotten a few good moments between Han and Luke and seen Luke in action one last time before his demise in the next film.,StarWarsLeaks,cxefprl,4,t5_2vflj

What is intresting in these particular comments is that their are some clear parallels to how Darth Sideous tempted and lured Anakin toward the dark side. It really depends on Snokes agenda however whether he tried and was successful in apprenticing Kylo or whether he tried and succeeded in converting him to a sith worshiping cult.The main reason why I think Plageus being snoke is equally unlikely is that the story we are hearing from the creative team and George Lucas is that they are making departures from the story that George wanted to tell.

5838763,0,t1_cxkz0gl,I absolutely agree about supporting the work of all the wonderful people that have made the film possible. I have tickets for myself and a few others to go see the film on December th at  PM the first showing in my town. I have spent hundreds of dollars on merchandise for a movie I havent even seen. I have a lot of faith in J.J. and the rest of the crew amp cast. I love the community that has evolved on here and all the little inside jokes that we have.    ...However thats not going to stop me from torrenting the film if it leaks. There is no money lost I just get to see it early. Why is that a bad or even morally questionable thing? Its not like Id go to the theater and shout spoilers. Im not that type of person. What I am however is extremely impatient. Id imagine thats the case with a lot of others here which is why we devour any morsel of information we get from any source no matter how small. Im here because I want to be spoiled. Im here because the casuals over on rStarWars dont know how to have a discussion and they instantly freak out over spoilers. Some of em dont even know who Snoke is. Thats insane to me.,StarWarsLeaks,cxkzlvt,2,t5_2vflj

I mean her mastery of the force while escaping her cell alone should raise some red flags. In that scene she understands and uses the force to the same level as could be expected from someone with years of training. I think there is an external force or factor that saved Rey from kylo and allowed her to tap into abilities that she should not have yet.Also its probably worth noting that there havent been any real lightsaber wielders in the galaxy for a long time now. Kylo has most likely been trained and become accustomed to using his lightsaber almost exclusively against blaster wielding opponents something he has been shown to have become very adept at. Perhaps he is simply inexperienced in terms of dueling someone else also wielding a saber.,StarWarsLeaks,cy37ojr,1,t5_2vflj

They are just different sides to the same thing after all. Fear and anger. Everyone has it. Its learning to not let it control you. Kylo is filled with light and dark as well. He struggles to not let the light control him though. The opposite of Luke. Kylo and Snoke arent Sith either. Snoke loves that Kylo has light in him as well as dark.

Anakin didnt know he had one son strongwiththeforce in like forever and even less a princess daughter even though Vader meets and tortures Leia his own daughter  pretty much in the first scenes of episode IV ...Also if you were separated from your parents at age  ... do you really think you would remember them at age ???

7375083,0,t1_d2gcxsz,gtAnyway it is quite clear from countless interviews behindthescenes material etc. that the PT has the depth of a kittens bowl of milk. I strongly disagree.  One of the most common complaints of the OT is a complicated plot with too many subplots happening at the same time.  Those movies were almost impossible to navigate the first time through BECAUSE there were too many details and motivations that werent explained well enough and shoved into too little screen time.  Hell a decade later were still discovering new things  like Palpatine stealing life force from Padme to keep Vader alive  that we didnt catch before.gtIm rambling I know. What I want to express is that there is no depth in the PTAgain the OT were more simple movies.  A small band of heroes straightforward plot clear villains beautifully done movies with the ever present Star Wars flaws like dialogue and awkward Lucas scenes.The PT was much deeper and expanded the universe MUCH more than the OT but at the expense of too many characters and poor plot structure to shoehorn everything in. Id prefer a good mix of the two but Id rather lean in the direction of requires multiple viewings to understand than theaudienceis dumb summer blockbuster like the Marvel movies which I love just not the right style for SW.gtAt least with TFA it gives me the FEELS. The good ones. Got the good feels once during the PT First time the logo came on screen with the music in EPI. And then the magic just died away second by second.Thats your opinion.  I get those feels more often in the PT than the OT.  TFA added a new element to SW for me though in the fantastic new character development.  I HATED the central plot but the rest of the movie built around it was fantastic in almost every detail so Im very grateful for that.  The constant visual and plot callbacks to the OT were the only thing that made it feel kind of hollow to me.Disclaimer I love all  movies.  Just like anyone I prefer some over others but none are bad or even mediocre movies to me.,StarWarsLeaks,d2ghunw,1,t5_2vflj

7479667,0,t1_d2q1rig,depends on what you are looking for in an information. I think this is a great scoop. it shows that Kylo Ren comes to Achto which is further backed up by the fact that burnt tree from Ireland set images is seen in the background of Reys Forceback with Knights of Ren. So it was planned well in advance that he will find Lukes location.Also if you look at the scoop itself he clearly makes distinction between whats scoop itself seen facts and what is his speculation based on the scoopA few weeks ago they blew up specifically blew apart an AhchTo hut. According to my source Kylo and Rey have a conversation that Luke does not like. Luke tries to stop them. Luke gets angry... and the whole hut they are in disintegrates re blows up. My source did not specify as to the exact cause of the disintegration This is the scoop. Rey and Kylo have a conversion Luke doesnt like what he hears tries to stop them hut explodes.but based on the info I believe Luke accidentally or perhaps even purposely does so using the Force.this is Bothan Soys speculation and he says so. he may be wrong any of the three FS could blow up the hut or external attack could blow it up or Luke forgot to switch off a stove etc or not.IMO biggest deal in this scoop isnt explosion but that ReyKylo conversation leads to Luke trying to stop them. Stop them from what? That is a question. From talking or doing something else? Furthermore that seems to be backed up by MSW podcast that followed few days after this scoop. Not exploding hut but whatever happens between Rey and Kylo.,StarWarsLeaks,d2se92o,2,t5_2vflj

I think Celebration was handled very poorly but the absolute worst part was the exclusivity of that trailer. Even the majority of people who were AT Celebration didnt get to see it!

We pretty much knew what was going to happen and he in no way tried to hide that or hit us with anything new just kinda expanded on the same ideas that had been floating around since ROTJ.

9493135,0,t1_d9iguq0,These are all fair points. I remember roboevil Luke sitting in his castle though. And the fact that a lot of reporting that was later proved waaaaay off was mysteriously deleted. From an ethical point of view that really irked me. Why feel the need to change the historical record? Why not have the maturity to stand by your mistakes? I think maybe at the time Jason and Co. were responding emotively to some really really unfair and harsh criticisms posted here and on The Cantina forums. If you do some research Amanda and Jason Ward made some really hardcore enemies backintheday on some of the older forums MF amp Force.net from memory in prequel and TCW days. I saw some vicious personal attacks thrown their way. Regardless of the questionably validity of such things there is already too much shit like that on the internet. Its too easy to stop seeing each other as human beings when we sit behind screens on a keyboard crusade. MSW far and away learned their lesson. They made some GIANT leaps . years ago and got slammed by people like us for it. So they tightened up their operation started verifying things crossreferencing and only reporting when they were fairly confident. They also toned down the opinion based content and speculation and shut down their comments section. On the whole they started treating what they do more like journalists and less like fans. How can we not be impressed when people learn from their mistakes? That is what adult life is all about. If you can systemize that process into your life or your organisation then youre kind of winning. ,StarWarsLeaks,d9j8d4a,4,t5_2vflj

Disney is trying to play the same cards as last year by injecting Star Wars into Christmas marketing but its not working this time. It might sell a couple more TFA or generic SW toys. But there is no Rogue One specific interest anywhere.It might do OK opening weekend with the holiday movie goers but ultimately its going to crash and burn. As for hardcore fans...so far every single line of dialogue from every single trailer has been cringe worthy awful. Im not sure the last time I saw a trailer or  trailers where every single line was terrible. Even the worst movies tend to make trailers seem passable.Outside of the nostalgic teases of Darth Vader and classic OT starships of which you can expect typical Gareth itsallinthetraileralready Edwards what does this movie have to entertain anyone?

Edit  think of it this way  The Dark Knight was risky for a superhero movie it put some people off but mostly people loved it even naysayers.

10057722,0,t1_dbih53l,You are overthinking this and missing the forest for the trees. Lets look at this image.It is a p screen cap from the new  Ben Hur bluray.  As the original aspect ratio is not x the image is now letterboxed to fit the p x blu ray standard. When people convert these blu rays to files for personal computers think mp mkv etc they typically crop the image to remove the black bars on the top and the bottom of the image. As those black bars are unnecessary pixels for the film itself and will only make the file size larger. Removing these bars in no way affects the clarity or resolution of the viewable portion of the film.  The resulting cropped image would be something like x.  And the internet at large not just myself still consider this a p rip even with the top and bottom black bars cropped. You can argue with me all you want but the rest of the internet is still going to refer to a cropped image as a p rip. As the actual resolution of the film content itself is unchanged from the p blu ray. Why still call it p?  Because it is a hold over from earlier technology where we referred to the resolution by the vertical. Think i ntsc vhs. A more appropriate modern name would be p or p but what are you gonna do? It is what it is. So with this being said the overwhelming majority of people would still consider that original image we talked about as being of greater resolution than a p image. ,StarWarsLeaks,dbijnfl,2,t5_2vflj

Sure Jedi can be wrong sometimes as Yoda and Ben were when they tasked Luke with killing Vader but the grey Jedi stuff is just edgy for edgyness sake.And dont give me that Jedi not allowing emotions crap. Jedi were allowed to feel both Yoda and ObiWan and I mean in prequels expressed sadness joy brotherly or fatherly love and even grief and thats just the peak of it. The only thing Jedi were not allowed to do was to form attachments as attachment leads to jealousy greed and fear. Even if they loved they were supposed to train themselves to let go of what they were afraid of losing. And its a sound precaution when such emotions are directly tied to the Dark Side. Jedi needed to be careful with their emotions because they influenced their power thoughts and actions.In TCW Yoda admitted that hes been ignoring his dark side and denied its existence. He then accepted himself for all he was achieved balance and learned some dope skillz in form of immortality. But did he become a Grey Jedi? No. He was just a better Jedi. And he passed that to Luke.

Ill watch everything till the Last Jedi sequel and in case theyll make one a Ben Kenobi Solo film and then Im done and I really hope that they are too. We dont need a new Star Wars story every year always planned  years ahead to eternity. Comicbook screen adaptations work that way because of what they are based off. But Star Wars doesnt.

JW is fun in the same way Return of the Jedi is fun  youre in the world but its almost cutesy and ridiculous. But thats not what Id like to see for the final film in a trilogy. It needs tight plotting excellent characterization and hold up to repeat viewings.For further evidence of this compare the death of the fat security guard in JW to how Spielberg approached the Raptors in the opening of the original film or the TRex attack  that shows that Treverrow is a weak director because the tension in how those scenes are filmed really dwarf the almost jokey dark comedy of Indominus eating the guy who is essentially mugging im dead to both Pratt and the audience.
