Its my first time posting and I shouldve read the sidebar more carefully so thats my fault.I hesitate to leave comments asking for help directly on offering posts because everyone here seems to have it much worse than me.

8510906,0,t3_4vjmlh,Hey dudeIm a bit older and I work with people your age so its inappropriate for us to talk privately... but I thought Id just say a few things.  Im sure youve heard a few of them before but I hope you dont just see these as platitudes.  They come from a genuine place and Im not trying to fob you off with meaningless stuff.For a start  I understand how you feel and how you feel is absolutely valid.  Dont let anyone tell you otherwise.  How do I know? First of all Ive been where you are.  For many years I felt the same way.  A background level of anxiety sadness and at times a real numbness during my teens and even through my s.  It doesnt matter what the trigger is be it a romance or just a background sadness...the fact is something is making you feel shitty.  You didnt ask to feel shitty. You just do and it might not be totally clear why.  But luckily there are things you can do about that.  Well get to that later.Second of all I see it every day where I work.  You would be surprised about how many people of all ages go through stuff like this.  Trouble is not many talk about it openly! You even say so in your message when you say you feel like people dont want to talk to you.  That probably says more about them than you to be honest.  But this environment where mental health isnt talked about openly and even dismissed as something that you just need to get over makes it looks like most people are ticking along just fine.  Thats not really the truth though.  We need to change this culture and get people taking mental health seriously.  Its a hugely important issue and you are definitely not alone.So what can we do about it? You might not like the solution...but let me tell you from experience it works. It really does.Talk.I know you say you cant speak with anyone in real life but hear me out.  I dont know you as a person or what your situation is so if the following TRULY doesnt apply to you forgive me.  I hope there is something in here that will work for you. Your parentsguardians really do want to hear whats going on in your head. They really do  even if it makes them feel uncomfortable at first.  Its hard to approach the subject so its best to just be matter of fact. Mum...I need to tell you that Im not feeling great...  Just that sentence and its out there.  Once its out it has to be confronted.  If they try to dismiss it as Just teenage things or whatever you need to be insistent that you talk.  The key though is to stay calm and matter of fact.  Calm. Resist the urge to freak out with the YOU DONT UNDERSTAND ME stuff as this will be interpreted as just teenage drama.  If you stay calm your words will be taken a lot more seriously.   If mumdaduncleauntbrothersister whoever in the family wont listen you need to take it to the next level.  Your GP.  Honestly this is a great bet.  Your doctor can put you in touch with counselorspeople to talk to for free.  You are allowed to make your own appointments and if anyone asks you can tell them the truth or ask for your privacy. Youre perfectly entitled to.  People your age visit the GP all the time for advice on STDs and things too.    Your GP will ALWAYS take you seriously.  I went and said to the Doctor Im struggling.  I feel sad and numb and I really want someone to talk to.  Best thing I ever did. You have a child protection officer  counselor at school.  They can also put you in touch with the right people to talk to and will also take you seriously.  Its their job.Counselingseeking people out to talk to is not for the weak.  If you have a headache you take a paracetamol.  So if your head is being a dick and messing up your day you need some medicine for that head.  Talking is that medicine and you can seek out the right dose for you.  Mine was my counselor and it was an awesome experience. TLDR Someone in real life is there for you you just might not know who they are yet.  The key is to explain you feel shitty in a calm manner even if you cant put your finger on WHY it is you feel shit.  The more people know you feel the way you do the easier it will eventually become to talk about it for both you and them.Good luck buddy.  ,KindVoice,d65f43p,2,t5_2xjrr
8618150,0,t1_d6itsuk,Hi!  Thanks for getting back to me. Heres my long story.  For the most part Im an easy going energetic and passionate extroverted person. I love sports meeting new people and having fun. But up until last year I had a major problem. I never had a girlfriend. I went on a few dates with some girls here and there but never met anyone I really wanted to spend time with until last year. When I met her the first time something just clicked and Ive never been so happy when she said she was single and she wanted to go out with me. Fast forward to now and we broke up a few months back for mutual reasons she was religious and I was not but we are still friends which I am glad about. I didnt realize until we broke up and how many tears that I cried how happy I was in the relationship. I had always told myself that you can live a happy life and not need to find someone but being in one changed my whole idea about my life. It really made realize that when someone really appreciates you for you the world somehow becomes a bit brighter the air cleaner the sounds crisper and I still think back on those times with a sense of nostalgia. But the nagging feeling before is gone and I feel validated that there iswas someone out there that loved me for me.  Now the thing Im uncertain about is the future. What will my passions be once I cant play sports? Where do I get my drive and excitement? Recently I took up singing lessons and I really feel super happysad singing. Its one of the very special things that you can express a message about your life in your song to a complete group of strangers without it being weird.  I dont know it just seems like a huge stroke of luck and circumstances that I met my ex. Im not picky but most times when I meet a girl they might be attractive but the more I get to know them the more I think theyre friend material and not someone I want to be in a relationship with. So a part of me wants to accept that this is how life will be going forward and that I need to find enough things to keep me going and to not look for someone else to complete my life since its more important to be happy with myself which I feel I am a lot more now than before thanks a lot to more friends I made too. But I still worry that ten or twenty years down the road if Im still by myself will I still have the same energy and drive for the joys of life or will I somehow become bitter when comparing myself to everyone else around me?  ,KindVoice,d6iv9e2,1,t5_2xjrr
