11778738,0,t1_dgv4t2h,i couldnt quite say what would be the best setup as I am new to this game the comment earlier is just general wisdom I got from playing summoners war for quite a while. There are other posts on this reddit that say what to reroll for etc. Since the game just came out it is hard for people that werent part of the beta testing to really give solid information at this point i think. We also are not quite sure as to what the future holds for this game as far as progression of the  stars and if they will do power creep stuff etc.,warofcrown,dgv5odi,1,t5_3go9d

11802084,0,t3_68eaf0,Only hunt for  shiny accessories. Until you find wanted mission to find the accessory keep farming when your inventory gets full sell some repeat until you get a  shiny accessory. By the time you do you will have both gold and accessories to lvl it up .,warofcrown,dgxt2f5,2,t5_3go9d
