A month late can turn you from being massively profitable to horribly in the red. For you its even easier to do these calculations since it sounds like youre only willing to spend BTC on gear meaning you dont have to compare your options with purchasing more BTC with USD.

201502,0,t3_1w2hdk,Bought  singles.  Paid in fiat paypal woo! which was nice because it was linked to my credit card    They said October delivery and based on past performance i ordered one of their mghz things and they delivered it in  weeks or so and checking their past history they had missed deadlines in the past.  Id punched in some numbers and said hell if they deliver by febmarch ill still do well.What people tend to forget is the competition at the time Avalon required payment in bitcoin and when  bitcoin is  dollars thats a lot of bitcoin and those limited spots went quick.  And other competition well i nearly backed BASIC as well and we all know how that ended.At this point sad to say thinking that id be rolling in bitcoin early next year I sold  of them from mining at  dollars each in December to pay for christmas period.  Big mistake.Incidentally the express shipping scam?  Smelt like a scam.  They wanted  dollars extra a unit what costs  dollars extra?  What would have been worth it is being able to pay the import tax to uk up front instead of waiting  weeks for customs to contact you when every second counts those units are going to earning the most when you plug them in and decreasing permanently afterwards.  The whole year you have been waiting  more weeks you hear in jest.  And it got fustrating.Ultimately they made me Bitcoin not  mind and i sold  of the units for more than the  cost me on ebay.  I would have had more bitcoinsmoney if i had just paid for them up front and held but I like to gamble the risk is exciting.  It could have been a lot worse i could have backed a complete scam and lost everythingtldr  BUY AND HOLD! ,BitcoinMining,cf1e6qv,2,t5_2skbb

Why are you not holding on to your rigs to continue mining? Again same answer.Most calculations take in to consideration rig costs. They dont usually take in to consideration the greater fool value you may be able to get for your rig when its older.The other consideration is if mining is better than just investing in Bitcoins. In Feb  coins were around USD. You spent BTC to get in to mining BTC a rig. You say you made around  from each rig you didnt say if that was after the cost of the rig or not Ill assume its pure profit so around  profit all told.If youd held on to that BTC instead of buying equipment youd have a total profit of .,BitcoinMining,cg2lzdr,6,t5_2skbb

Lets see the past few increases roundedNov  Oct  Oct  Sept  Sept  Aug  Aug Change that to  average increase and you lose .BTC over  days before it goes negative on the power cost!So moral of the story is mining is only profitable if you haveA Really cheapFree Power under .KWH at least!B Can get efficient hardware for cheaper than advertised prices ie forget ordering from a vendor website find a used miner where the owner finally realized its a losing gameRemember you are competing with thisYou think you can buy miners cheaper than those guys get them off the factory floor?Buying the wrong miner is a bad move too.  A PRISMA is about .Watts of power draw per GH which is pretty close to the most efficient stuff you can buy today.  The original Avalons were WGH.  That is why you see a bunch of them decommissioned in the Chinese mining farm pics above!TLDRIf you are mining today you are probably insane.,BitcoinMining,clwcuqo,4,t5_2skbb

The pool doesnt change the calculation it just transforms a few huge payouts into a regular stream of small payouts and with small amounts of hashs it might be the only way to get any payout at all before the universe stops to exist.If its true that I can buy  times more bang for the buck then there might actually lie my biggest mistake.

8562636,0,t1_d6beqda,I didnt count losses on the branch circuit due to the higher voltage drop at V vs .  Testing was simpleSplit the outer sheathing of a  to C power cord to expose the  inside wires and put a clamp ammeter around the the hot or neutral.  For a load I used a altcoin eth mining rig providing a fixed DC load of about  of the PSU rating where most PSUs get their peak efficiency.  Used another meter to measure the exact voltage around here V is typical.   Did the same thing for  as I have both  and V outlets in my workshop.You also dont need special plugs.  Standard NEMA  receptacles are fine at V as are the power cords.  Although you dont often see  supplying V plugs that accept a  polarized plug to provide V can be found in many countries such as Brazil.I did write V! in marker on the plate cover just in case a friendneighbor is in my workshop when Im not around and is looking for someplace to plug in an AC power tool such as a drill or table saw.As for your code citations regarding heat it seems you dont get that code was made years ago so school dropouts with a grade education could work in a trade while not putting other peoples lives at risk.  Im talking about people who need a calculator to work out PIR and have little hope of calculating resistance given voltage drop and current.So if the code says that A on AWG inside a drywallclad wall i.e. little convective cooling in a C boiler room is going to get over C its WRONG.  Calculate the power dissipation in the wire the thermal resistance of the sheathing and the surrounding air typically measured in CW and Id bet a case of beer youll get a number around C or C above ambient.Now the folks at CSA NRCan amp CMHC arent idiots but they tend to assume the trades reading the code are idiots.  So youll probably find a note somewhere in the code or an appendix that says the heat derating tables are based on a bundle of  or so wires like you could get when a lazyass electrician cant find his recip saw and so borrows the plumbers  hole saw to cut into the bottom plate of an inside wall and stuffs all the upstairs branch circuits from the panel into the  hole.Yet even that is unlikely to be a fire hazard.  Youd probably have to tiestrap the the bundle of wires together for the full height of the wall in order to get enough contained heat to make a fire hazard.p.s. Ive heard of people that dont have access to their panel using an adapter for the dryer plug to use their laundry room for mining rigs.  You can put together a R to C power cord for around  in parts.,BitcoinMining,d6bwo5a,1,t5_2skbb
