5444789,0,t1_cw74bcj,First of all I would like to thank the author of this awesome app for efforts and for the app itself. I think if it was listed in Apples appstore it would be in top  best apps for iOS. On a serious note I know that my scripts are probably not working due to new findColor and inputText methods. ampnbspinputText I use it in FIFA  and Madden games to input price digits into text field. The old version of AutoTouch did that very well but in the new versions nothing happens after tapping on the text field i.e. straight slash is just blinking without any input.  ampnbspfindColor I use this function to search for various color gems in King of Thieves game. There are about  different colors and for each I use findColor function. Here is a short section from my scriptampnbsp    PURPLE GEMS    local pa  findColors.. ..       .. ..  nil purplea    purplea  pa    if purplea  nil then    playAudiovarbeep.mp     usleep    end    usleep        local pb  findColors.. ..    .. ..  nil purpleb    purpleb  pb    if purpleb  nil then    playAudiovarbeep.mp     usleep    end    usleep    NEXT BASE    touchDown . .    usleep    touchUp . .    usleep     ampnbspIn old versions the whole process of scanning through   findColor functions took  seconds. Now it cant find anything and there is no response. Its probably due to the new coordinate system and I have to rewrite my script again but for me the problem was that it takes a long time to do so many findcolor functions and test them again. Thanks for replying!,autotouch,cw7mhkh,1,t5_367yf
5458824,0,t3_3ptcfb,i need the same thing just to close out of an add in a diffrent app but form what i rember coordinates arent to hard to do when i was trying to figure it out a long while back to do that exact same things P.  If i get some free time i will look in to it though ,autotouch,cw9f06w,1,t5_367yf
5459839,0,t3_3ptx5x,Yea I just tried results are way off.  If it cant script straight lines advanced coc attacks are out of the question lol.  I hope it gets patched or a solution is found soon,autotouch,cw9jod9,1,t5_367yf
5772692,0,t1_cxci999,Thank you very much I will make this happen. I am trying to work with If else statements. I want to set something that holds a part of the screen at all times unless a color is put on a pixel on the screen. when that pixel hits that point it does some basic swipes and taps.     local tapColor       repeat          local region  getColor            if getColor  tapColor then             my taps and swipes         else             tap and hold    end    I keep getting nil error so its been a lot of guessing is there an easy way to do this???Got it working. Thanks for all your help guysVrLSHeidelberger ,autotouch,cxcnmo2,1,t5_367yf
6023679,0,t3_3u6p3r,I have the same issue on my  Plus on ... I have tried to contact the dev without luck. I was thinking maybe it was a difference between the free version and the paid but I refuse to pay money for the full version without any confirmation.,autotouch,cy986ex,1,t5_367yf
6576086,0,t1_czxrw7r,No it wont be that complicated.  Technically you are right there would be cosine and sine involved in a coordinate system transform but since it is rotated  degrees all cosines and sines would end up being  or .  So it would end up a fruitless endeavor dont go down that path.  I know for sure that the xOriginal will be used in the yConverted and the yOriginal in the xConverted. And there may be a screenHeight  ...  or a screenWidth  ... in front.  As another example here are the equations I use to convert a landscape orientation with home button on the right and origin in the bottom left corner to a portrait up orientation with the origin in the top left corner.    xConverted  screenWidth  yOriginal  scaleFactor    yConverted  xOriginal  scaleFactorNow I am not sure about iPads but the device coordinate system for iPhones is not intuitive at all.  The origin is in the TOP LEFT CORNER of the device when you hold it in portrait mode as opposed to all life in math class growing up with it in the bottom left.  And I have found that these are the coordinates that getColor and findColor operate in.  Also the scaleFactor is to compensate for the retina display scale when converting a pixel editors coordinates to iOS which you probably dont need.  and the screenWidth  is only because the ycoordinate system is flipped.I just saw shirtandtielers comments below after typing this so its kind of past the point but what the heck I spent all this time typing here you go!,autotouch,czzirz1,1,t5_367yf
7233623,0,t1_d20em1q,The text file can be single or multiple line. If needs be I can even have a separate txt file for yes and a separate txt file for no recordings. From first glance the code youve laid out and the final output looks more or less spot on in terms of doing what I was hoping. I have a question how would I then return a value for ltapplegt in another script?,autotouch,d20erz0,1,t5_367yf
7920836,0,t1_d41zdi1,Sorry to bug you again but I have another question. I am using a script     repeat     tapxy     untilId like to make a script that repeats that until it finds a color or multiple colors on the screen. Once it finds those Id like it to do a very long tapxy sequence. Could I use the same thing as above but just replace the     tapa awith      tapxy      usleep      tapxyetc. Thanks!,autotouch,d46dkme,1,t5_367yf

9974377,0,t3_5i9zzt,Your guess is exactly right! When you want more than one condition to be met you would use and implying it must meet both the first and second getColor. Then you would simply seperate the third check with an or. If you have any further questions let me know!,autotouch,db7osuk,2,t5_367yf
10458870,0,t3_5p3av7,These unfortunately are all known bugs I use this function instead which automatically fixes the getColor bug        function detectColourxInput yInput                local w h  getScreenResolution                local xConverted  h  yInput                  local yConverted  xInput                local colours  getColorsxConvertedyConverted                if colours  nil and colours gt  then                    return colours                end                return             end,autotouch,dctm9tq,1,t5_367yf
10990541,0,t1_ddosivk,Works perfectly for me on .unak try reinstalling AutoTouch,autotouch,dedqrej,1,t5_367yf
10991407,0,t1_deajfcg,Ok I think I know why I am having a problem....when it doesnt find the color it will repeat the function until the counter reaches X.  Once it reaches X the break will cause it to end the loop and continue on with the script rather than end the entire script and start over. What  happens is wifi is never cut off when it ends the loop and it messes up my process.  I think if I put a second os.execute line after the second end that would solve my problem.  Does my reasoning make sense?,autotouch,deduaj1,1,t5_367yf
