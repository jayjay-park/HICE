315203,0,t3_1x32ft,Docs Motorworks has a variety of sliders and theyre only  during HH and all day Tuesdays.  The burger sliders are  mini cheeseburgers served with grilled onions so theyre preeetty close and I think they serve with pickles on the side. The HH is pretty decent and theres a huge patio with SoCo people watching.,austinfood,cfdfune,1,t5_2ve11
393754,0,t1_cfkpv78,Now if theyd just open one up somewhere in the middle...  I was doing some work fairly regularly near Cedar Park a couple of years ago and got hooked on Stuffed and Noble Pig.  Sadly I hardly make it around any more.  I need to go up with a cooler some time just to load up on sausage tasso nonChinese crawfish tails etc. and pick up a poboy while Im at it.,austinfood,cflkucr,1,t5_2ve11
578613,0,t3_20dncn,Ok most shocking Ive found so far is Pho Dan one of my fav pho spots went from  to  in just  monthsBut Kerbey Lane off the drag improved from  to .. but they dont have pho...,austinfood,cg61jlr,2,t5_2ve11
636306,0,t1_cgcj8sp,This is the best answer. Enoteca is actually better IMO. Cipollina is actually pretty good as well  And a lot more seating.,austinfood,cgcljvg,7,t5_2ve11
643540,0,t1_cgcj8sp,Completely agree about it being better and less expensive. Get the appetizer... I dont remember what its called but its essentially a deepfried ball of risotto. Its incredible.,austinfood,cgdf5z9,3,t5_2ve11

4541327,0,t3_3d7xn3,Stiles Switch brisket can be good if unreliable. That said its only let me down after pm so its not like I could have gone anywhere else.Manns brisket is fine. Its the only place that has given me brisket that was TOO fatty and I like it fatty. Their turkey and chicken are more impressive and their jalapeo cheese sausage is among the best.Not exactly in North Austin but the drive to Louie Mueller is only about mless time than youd spend waiting in line at plenty of placesand their brisket is toptier. Plus Ive never had to wait in line on a weekday.,austinfood,ct329hh,2,t5_2ve11

6927384,0,t3_4alh8n,All the options already mentioned are great. Terry Blacks on Barton Springs has catered some events where I work as well so thats another option. Also you might think about the places out in Lockhart e.g. Kreutz Market. Definitely more trouble since Lockhart is mi outside of Austin but its supposed have some of the best BBQ joints in the country. ,austinfood,d11jlo2,6,t5_2ve11
7815275,0,t1_d3uhzc7,Ok interesting.  Is the Austin food scene large enough for Time Inc. to start a new blog?,austinfood,d3ui1w9,1,t5_2ve11
8378243,0,t1_d5otrgk,In that case definitely go to La BBQ and not Blacks.,austinfood,d5otv60,3,t5_2ve11
8525717,0,t3_4whpdp,Go and stage at one of these restaurants.  Work for free during your spare time and learn from them.  Stop by one of those place between pm and pm ask to speak with the chef and explain to him what your situation desire and skill set are and let them know you are willing to learn for free.  Very few restaurants will turn down free help and you may wind up enjoying it to the point you change careers.  ,austinfood,d679zwt,2,t5_2ve11
8756545,0,t3_50039i,I had the Benny Duo last week with classic and caprese. It was yummy. The atmosphere was way to hip for me and it was really loud. ,austinfood,d70861w,3,t5_2ve11
8764007,0,t3_5037ch,Im pretty sure you are talking about Texican Cafe.  I have had the cabrito there and it is pretty good but not  good.When dining there I like their tortilla soup and anything involving their carne guisada every once in a while the meat is a bit tough but usually it is very tender and tasty.  ,austinfood,d715uwg,1,t5_2ve11
8982090,0,t1_d7rfjp1,that hasnt really changed. I went before and after but the amount of stock of the bakery was the same it just was more condensed space wise. ,austinfood,d7riczx,1,t5_2ve11
9382903,0,t1_d94mqvd,As a European donuts doughnuts? look like a staple food of USA culture. So I was planning to have some while there unless I am being misled and donuts arent a thing in Texas.I found many different places while looking for this like SampH round rock Mrs Johnson and so on but those are too far away. In your opinion what place near Downtown would be a better alternative for this? ,austinfood,d95ckur,1,t5_2ve11
9921821,0,t3_5h4url,Only place I found them was in the Hong Kong Supermarket near the Target and Cocos CafeRamen TetsuYa.They definitely usually carry them there.,austinfood,db0u6js,1,t5_2ve11
10891259,0,t3_5vlcxh,Take a photo of it next time! Without the accents and my already poor Vietnamese reading comprehension I have no clue! LolI tried google and it said maybe chicken hearts? Long ga can mean chicken feathers and Dong Nai is a place apparently. But without the accents it could be anything. But if its little reddish things about the size of your thumb and in a pack of  or so its probably is chicken hearts ,austinfood,de3ctvs,2,t5_2ve11
