623793,0,t1_cflo7bo,Im pretty sure they cant do that if theyre just thoughts because everyone has them. Often someone needs to have the thoughts  a plan  actual intent to follow through on that plan  access to whatever they plan to use before it would be legal for them to break confidentiality. Usually its phrased imminent danger to self or others e.g. violent fantasies wouldnt count. Rules are different for psychologists therapists with a doctorate  Ph.D. or Psy.D vs masterslevel and vary by state when it comes to mandatory reporting laws psychologists have choice masters level must report usually if that is what you are concerned about. If you saw someone who said they would turn you in to the police for thoughts you have you should get a new therapist  you should feel safe to talk about anything you are thinking about in therapy. A therapist that makes you feel that you cant or shouldnt is not a good therapist. ,sadcomics,cgb6cb4,1,t5_2qtg2
