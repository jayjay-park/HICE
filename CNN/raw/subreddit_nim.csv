11059175,0,t1_dekf9lv,I do agree that the sformerlyformally mistake is indeed harmful because it can create an impression that the language has two names formal and informal.  I just submitted a comment about that to the blogger.But all other criticism here has been way over the top.  The quality of the article while indeed flawed does not justify your level of negativity.Its a small blog based in Sri Lanka where English proficiency is not great.  We should encourage more people in all parts of the world to blog about Nim even if their English is less than perfect. The purpose of spreading this article to Reddit social media etc is to encourage other people to write better articles.It is common to describe languages that have OOP features as object oriented even if theyre not pure OOP ex C Python etc.It might not be the most accurate use of terminology but your one example does not justify terms like completely incorrect or just pure wrong.  ,nim,deljfj5,1,t5_333n4
11391599,0,t1_dfn7u33,One good way I can think about is taking the backend of his project and the frontend of mine and putting it together. I do feel like React gives a better user experience but his backend is far more advanced than mine. Not a bad idea at all. That said Im obviously willing to contribute on this. ,nim,dfn7yg5,2,t5_333n4
