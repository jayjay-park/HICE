1367885,0,t3_29rdvi,Yes glad to see people are taking this seriously now! Well have it down in no time. MsTeq is my favorite Youtube guide. The only thing well change from her strategy is that well use soak team most probably if we PF the healers instead of two team on Fireball and Conflag.For snakes I usually do one BLM dps adds until  and the rest get Ascle. Then get all  adds together with ascle and hit them all with Mage LB. Kill the rest of adds so that ascle gets  stacks and then everyone burn ascle. As she said there are a couple strategy that works for the Asclepius phase.I feel pumped again now! Go FC.,SofP,cinr4hb,1,t5_31qhc
