9247643,0,t3_570gk6,I hope there are strong options for control in each category. Itd be a real shame for the game to be easy enough that you could beat it without using anything but the most basic attacks. I love being forced to adapt to move on but it becomes painful when adapting just means choosing the highest value attack and spamming it,vxg,d8o7gcl,3,t5_3ftna
