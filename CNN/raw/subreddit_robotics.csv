48533,0,t3_1unipn,Hes got the right idea but it needs to be mated with drones. Wheeled robots can only get until the gate. They need to navigate around obstacles on the road. They could pose a threat to traffic. If along with a robotic delivery truck there were was a suite of drones sitting on their charging ports when the truck signals that it is at an optimal location all the drones can take off via the retractable roof of the truck drop their loads and fly back and position for the next delivery.Drones can take the shortest path between two points avoiding any obstacles of course. They can land inside peoples properties not just leave it at the door step. A smart drone can even hover at the correct height with a signature pad if signatures are needed. ,robotics,cejyeug,14,t5_2qh0p

670172,0,t3_21sp5n,Youre basically building a large RC boat which has autonomous capabilities.Heres how Id probably go about it... Start off by getting a small speedboat second hand off of somewhere like ebay. Get a stroke outboard motor stroke as theyre far more efficient preferably also with electric start. Work out how much fuel would be required for a km trip. Fit a suitably sized fuel tank. Get a suitably sized linear actuator to control the steering. Youll want one which includes a feedback potentiometer. Get a decent waterproof servo and attach to the throttle cable of the outboard. Get an Arduino a GPS shield a GSM shield motor control shield for the linear actuator and a backup radio shield. Get an AIS receiver which can communicate with the Arduino via serial.Now you have all the ingredients you need to write the control software for the Arduino.The Arduino will basically need three stages of operation.... Manual steering amp throttle control via GSM or radio link.      This is basically just for manually guiding the vehicle to the dock when its within visual range.. Automated guidance toward target GPS coordinates.      The majority of the journey will be undertaken in this mode. It basically operates the linear actuator to keep the craft steered toward the destination and operates the throttle keeping the engine at its most efficient rev range.      As well as just being able to go in a straight line to a destination youll probably also want to add the ability to give it a set of waypoints and it to have it go from one to another.. Object avoidance using received AIS telemetry.     While in mode two the vessel will constantly be monitoring AIS signals and if another vessel gets too close this mode will kick in and cause your vessel to steer away from it.You may also want an engine restart amp emergency mode which detects engine failure attempts to restart it and broadcasts an emergency signal if the engine cannot be restarted.,robotics,cggg4n1,4,t5_2qh0p

896501,0,t3_24dqdj,I think a good robotics project would be to make a D printable actuator pack that connects to an Arduino module. The actuator pack could then be connected to strong monofilament fishing line or steel cables to control puppet like armatures. The actuators could be a series of bobbins that wire can be wound on to make linear voice coil actuators with neodymium magnets. Another cool project would be to make a D printable reaction drive gyro stabilization module. Imagine D printed gyro wheels that have slots for lead fishing weights and the wheels react to accelerometers to provide stabilization to a free standing armature. When connected to the Arduino module it can use accelerometers to drive the reaction wheels. I also think an Arduino LIDAR sensor pack that draws a D space in software is important. A robot needs to be able to place its virtual armature in a D world. A game engine should be used for a robot to create maps in real time for navigation and interactive prop detection. A list of props in the map maker could be preset and the robots vision system would make some kind of best guess of what the prop is and then once its placed in the virtual map it can then be interacted with. Maybe people that follow robotics development closer than I do could explain if this is already happening or not. I can also imagine little motion capture modules that can be stuck to a persons body that when calibrated produce a virtual armature in a game engine. Perhaps even a Kinect could be used for the motion capture calibration. The motion capture modules would also vibrate with the use of variable linear transducers to provide some kind tactile feedback similar to the way Valves Steam controller provides tactile feedback. Combining all of these systems would allow a person using an Oculus Rift VR headset to control a virtual armature that is in turn teleoperating an actual robotic armature. I am still wondering why none of this isnt already open source and available for printing. I think this would be great for the next generation of super toys as well as full scale bipedal robots. ,robotics,ch66q8e,3,t5_2qh0p

However my industry experience tells me that practical commercial knowledge is very valuable in understanding certain critical design constraints which are not always obvious from a theoretical point of view.  It would be interesting to see what is being taught in terms of complex system torsional stiffnessand similar type concepts.gtStill using leadscrews?The prior one you saw was ball screws specifically because they are very efficient and back drivable. They work fairly well but do limit arm movement to about  degrees and even then the effective gear ration changes by about . I may try them again in the future they do work quiet well to be honest probably for the same reason they are used so extensively in machining..  It was a bit slow in the old video because I didnt have high power drivers at the time and there were a few bugs in the control algorithm. Its much faster and smoother now.gtLooks like most of your instability is in the base.Absolutely. The base is a hassle. There are two parts which I find a hassle in the design its the end effector actuators and the base.  them middle part of the arm is easy. Its the machining that is a hassle.  Trying to come up with a design that is super cheap is hard. That said in the video about  of the wobble was from the trolley the arm was mounted on. There was still a few mm from the base though. Most of that was from my poor machining and a bit was from the flex in the shaft.gtCommercial robots get around this by using very large lazy susan bearings.I had definitely looked at them. The reason i didnt use them is because Like you say cost too expensive. Otherwise its also non trivial to work them into a cheap design.gtI know what you mean about the actuators. Im working on a robot arm right now and its crazy how hard it is to get a good gearbox theres no demand compared to good enough.I felt like an idiot for a long time when i started because of that. As time went on I soon realized there is a big deficit in that area and that is why very people are not building effective robotic arms. I certainly have done regular searches for harmonic and cycloidal drives to see if anything comes up on the market.  I am surprised harmonic drives still have patent problems they have been around for  years. I wouldnt machine one myself thougheven cycloidal to much precision required.  When you say printing are you using plastic or are you metal laser sintering?  Once again I thought the accuracy would not be good enough? I am certainly no expert though.  There seems to be lots of options that no one is making cheaply. Ones I like include compound planetary gearssimilar principle to harmonic drives not like the standard planetary configurations used in standard industrial style gearboxes. My favorite is a ball worm drive or wormcam drive.  They are using in cnc but again no oneaka chinese is making them cheaply.  The only cheap precision drive the Chinese seem to be making is ball screws.  Wouldnt mind setting up myself if i wasnt already in over my head with the rest of the project.Currently I am not showing the actuatorsarm in any of the newer videos because I am looking to patent one of the actuators I am using nownot ballscrews...  Mainly because I suspect there could be a good market for really low cost accuratemm or lessish robotics. Essentially its very low costand backlash but has very high torque to weight. Its limit is torsional stiffness.  That could be compensated for by absolute encoders on the output shaft but it seems more than accurate enough without it for me.  Currently I have a design which targets a load of about kg to kg over a m arm. It is very cheap but it would be nice to get a bit cheaper then I could sell it to the hobby market.  A large one could work well as a super cheap pallet packing botInterestingly the thing that is holding me up is not being satisfied with the base shaft stiffness and trying to develop a cheap structure to support that shaft.gtStill waiting on you to tell us how you get cheap encoders. Best Ive found is   ppr on ebay.To me  is fairly cheap for a generic shafted encoder for hobby style use.  For a volume application I would consider it insanely expensive.similar to what is in commercial printers and gadgets. or  encoder  wheelI guess you probably know this..

The original Big Trak was a sixwheeled twowheel drive tank with a frontmounted blue photon beam headlamp and a keypad on top. The toy could remember up to  commands which it then executed in sequence. There also was an optional cargo trailer accessory with the U.K. version being white to match its colour scheme once hooked to the Bigtrak this trailer could be programmed to dump its payload.gtgtImage i  A U.K. BigTrakInteresting List of microprocessors | Experiment Zero | IRobot Create | Index of robotics articles Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcnmchw oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecnmchw.

I have basic but not expert level knowledge in pretty much everything else and it has not been and I dont foresee it being an issue. In academics you really push the possible in one or two areas. Itd be inefficient if everyone had to be an expert in all aspects of a field but a basic understanding is often useful. I think a better question to ask is what do you want out of your PhD?

5337458,0,t1_cvtl6r5,Thanks man! Just so you know when the force was lb the response time was terrible. If you have lower force requirements then you will have faster responses. And nothing will happen until it reaches its phase change temperature only the energy put in after it is at that temperature will be doing actual work.We mightve been able to go beyond lbs too. We started out with g weights and worked our way up until we ran out of the weights. Then we started just piling other things on the table onto the plate to see where we could get too. After measuring .kglbs of weight lifted and seeing it slow down to a snails pace we just said that was good enough and stopped.

5692924,0,t3_3t15jg,Dont knock the basics!  A complex design is still just a lot of very basic work repeated again and again.Speaking of repeated again and again Id really like to stress the difference between an engineer and everybody else an engineer will make a hell of a lot of mistakes before coming up with the final product.  Everyone else gives up after one or two failures.  I stress this because your high school work would have to have a strict timetable.  As a full fledged even hobbyist engineer your work will simply be the same as your high school work with the benefit of starting all over again and again and again and again...  You will notice that a lot of engineers who blog their progress get a lot of fail in the mix and you will begin to realize that when someone shows off some highly polished design on youtube its usually a Mark VII Mark VIII or even Mark XXII design of the original idea.Lets see sources that I have really liked... A retired engineer on youtube who has been publishing mechanical movements for quite some time... Instructibles is NOT the best place but it provides a starting point at least. If you have the money The Stan Winston School is excellent.  I do practical effects for film and when I branch out this is a nice spot to learn some basics.  Again I particularly enjoy videos like Basic Animatronics because they dont edit out when the artist makes a mistake or decides to change a design mid instruction... like real engineering here... Hackaday is a long time favorite and the coverage is VERY eclectic which is a huge advantage in animatronics because there are no set in stone rules.  It references instructables a lot which are more of the hobbyists experimenting but it also links to a lot of people who are very professional both in experimentation and end design. Make magazine is pretty much equivalent to Hackaday but in a more end user friendly package.  Sometimes the columnists present themselves as a bit more of an authority which is a tad bit misleading just remember that any article that claims this is the way to do this... there are actually probably a number of alternative methods.Finally a bit of personal advice you never know what will help.  Always be ready to learn something new because you will surprise yourself with how many different methods there are for doing the same thing.  Find some authoritative cosplay blogs and you will learn all sorts of things about materials.  Learn about DIY pneumatic and hydraulic mechanisms learn about anatomy history...  Just learn everything really.  Those links I listed are a great start but the learning never ends really.

6112195,0,t3_3z54xt,I dont know how to answer your question but Id like to say I checked out the blog and its a really nice blog. I always like seeing implementations as sometimes the theory gets a bit abstract.But as for prereqs I would think youd need to know some basic Control Theory and basic Kinematics. As in what a PID is and how to do forwardinverse Kinematics. If you know these two youd know how to use inverse Kinematics to get a multilink robot to move from one point to another point mathematically and then using PID you can replicate it in real life or a simulated arm.DMP is an extension on that which is instead of moving from one point to another you also specify the path you take. A simple nonDMP method to do this would be to draw a spine in space from your start to your goal discretize it then repeat your hand moving algorithm on the points in the spline. I guess DMP is a sum of weighted gaussians with the weights calculated by an equation given by a paper the blog poster referenced.,robotics,cyke6ph,1,t5_2qh0p
6160161,0,t3_3zw1th,As stated by FriendlyFire starting point for looking into this is in behavioral robotics namely hybrid robot architectures. Purely behavioural robot is too hard to design to do seemingly deliberative actions like planning on how to move from room to another room but hybrid deliberatereactive software is the one you need. Though just stating that is still too much hand waving without content. To get a better grasp on could be a Hybrid deliverativereactive robot software architecture look into for example AuRApdf The basic idea is that you can have your fast controllers and fast processes to read on the sensor inputs and which you design to be smooth and all. Then our higher level processes are ones affecting this bunch of controllers modifying the parameters of PID values target values etc or swapping or enablingdisabling some controllers altogether. These higher processes could be executed in a separate thread of the program in separate process or in separate microcontroller or full PC however  you design your system.,robotics,cypuhxg,1,t5_2qh0p

6321412,0,t1_cz6ol2a,So there are a couple ways to do this. One method is to put a multiaxisxyz and rotations force torque sensor on the robots end effector. If the end effector hits something you can figure out the force on the end of it and you can control it.But the problem with this is you can only know the force on the end effector. So what robots that interact with humans like baxter do is measure the torque on each joint. If a robot hits something you will know from the joint torques. In fact if you control the joint torques rather than position you can get robust behavior. If you set torque to be x then when the robot hits something it will stop moving and attempt to keep the torque at x.So there are a couple ways to do this. A way that can be done is to estimate the torque from the current the motor draws. This is what is done in universal robot arms and haptic interfaces.Another way to measure torque is to put a torque sensor on the joint. Most often resistive strain gauges are used to do this but electromagnetic and optical sensors have been used to do this. Look up force servos for demonstration of how FSRs can be used to do this.Another means to sense torque is to put a spring between the motor and the what is being moved and to measure the deflection of the spring. If you know the spring constant and deflection you can calculate the torque applied to the spring. This is known as a series elastic actuator. This also has the advantages of adding compliance to a robot which helps prevent damage to the motors gearbox or a human. Though it does have the disadvantage of making control more difficult.,robotics,cz86bak,2,t5_2qh0p

7263127,0,t3_4efcrg,You dont necessarily need to do PID to do what you want. Put a simple pulse encoder on each wheeloutput shaft. Monitor the speed of the pulses.. Set the PWM for each motor when driving straight forward or reverse the PWM should be set the same of course.. If a difference in timing of the pulses is detected speed up increase PWM the side with longer times or slow down decrease PWM the side with shorter times  until the pulse lengths match again.Thats the basic idea at least. You could of course apply PID to this algorithm as the above will likely have oscillationhunting problems in certain cases but the idea above could be implemented as a rough stab to see how it should work.Finally  you might also try to figure out a way to live with the error inherent in the system even if you manage to implement a proper PWM control scheme youll still have error  you wont ever be able to remove all of the error from the speed control. So instead of trying to fight it which you wont likely win  learn to work around it.Thats the idea behind SLAM Simultaneous Localization and Mapping  because there will always be error in your positioning and in your sensors  so instead of fighting it the algorithms go for go enough and use probabilities to guesstimate location on the map as the map is built. A similar approach could be used depending on the needs of the robot.,robotics,d23rlkj,1,t5_2qh0p

By comparing how much current the motor should require and how much it actually does you can estimate the load in some conditions.Force and torque sensors often use strain gages attached to special metal shapes designed to deform linearly for a given forcetorque. They usually will use strain gages so you see a change in resistance for different forces. Kind of like this .

10399735,0,t3_5ou6zh,Math is a great start but you will need a lot more practical experience. Take some embedded systems classes. This is less about math and more about microcontrollers. Sure they are based on math but you will never invent a computer so you will likely never get that deep. Controls and dynamics are more math ish and you can learn the important stuff along the way. Build some circuits and make an Arduino your bitch. That or take some classes.,robotics,dcmvkep,1,t5_2qh0p
10451234,0,t1_dcspvx7,gt Open source CAD options are pretty lacking unfortunately Yeah Im starting to see that.  I have access to solid works inventor autocad and others Im a college student but Id rather support open source projects because in the future either I pay  for a copy or I steal it and I dont like those options... I found some plugins for blender but apparently its still shitty compared to proper CAD software like you said. openSCAD seems useful for more complicated objects but I guess thats it in my opinion. I think Im gonna give FreeCad a try...,robotics,dcsqvzv,1,t5_2qh0p

10912437,0,t3_5vvene,Hello NiMh arent as common anymore as LiPo offer a higher capacity  smaller size. Their charging needs some care and discharging them too far will damage them. But there are a lot of protection circuits so thats not a big deal.You could look at Hobbyking.com or just local vendors.A s  cell pack would work well .v.To protect it from discharging too low there are multiple solutions   You can get a small  pcb from ebay you will have to solder connections to the pack ideally get a pack with balancing plug yourself for the cheaper boards  or you could use a brushed motor ESC that will cut off the motors while still providing v for the Arduino.  Easy but you need one for each motor. Eliminates the motor driver though.  Get a cheap Lipo warner that will buzz once the pack runs low  The easiest solution but  wont shut the power off automatically  Use the microcontrollerArduino to monitor voltage      Or you can get  lipo cells with builtin protection.    Charging the packs gt A simple charger costs a few bucks.  simple charger a bit better,robotics,de5jgss,2,t5_2qh0p

10918405,0,t1_de1h4kv,Thank you so much for this response. I guess Im confused because Im pretty certain Ill be able to get into the program at Columbia based on my other qualifications Also my undergrad thesis mentor knows Dr. Agrawal personally and so it would be easy for me to transition to this lab. MIT CMU etc not so much. I will check out JHU though. That sounds promising. Thanks again!Edit I was also wondering what is the general opinion on working with a lab that isnt known as yet. Like the one at Columbia. Its only three years old and they seem to be doing a lot of work. But they arent known for this specifically as yet. So I was wondering if I should take that into consideration too.,robotics,de65n30,1,t5_2qh0p

11133956,0,t1_deu0qat,Creative perhaps but in total violation of food safety handling procedures. An employee tasting food they were about to serve to a customer would get fired.Also if you read the article the robot just pushes the cooked burger to a persons right next to it. Its definitely going to be that guys job to make sure Flippy McFlipface isnt McFlipping flappy meats. Edit also I would have gone with noticing its rotten before spending all the time cooking it not realize after the fact that theyve cooked a rotten burger.  You really kept the spirit of the modern fast food worker though. ,robotics,deu0upl,2,t5_2qh0p

Im in a team which has about  engineers making complex autonomous systems not robots per se but a similar set of engineering problems and staff and there isnt anyone  including the people with EE and CS backgrounds and even with PhDs  who does both hardware and software simultaneously and equally.  There are a few software people who do a little bit of EE support and vice versa but certainly we would never expect someone hired to do CS to be an expert on hardware we expect them to become an expert in their own job not someone elses.,robotics,dgf6byw,1,t5_2qh0p
