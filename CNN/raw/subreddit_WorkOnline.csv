5678485,0,t3_3suhtr,First of all with that kind of pain you probably qualify for disability. Getting the diagnosis will take at least a year but go see your doctor and mention how difficult it has been to work and see if you can get the ball rolling with that. If you have a hard time performing your current job because of the pain try to get it documented in some way so if you lose the job it help your disability claim. Disability doesnt pay much though so you might want to focus on other routes. If you want to make money online you can do the typical WorkOnline stuff but youre competing with hundreds of thousands of other people. You might want to make your own small businesses. Check out the SmartPassiveIncome blog and podcasts and see if anything comes to you. You could also do computer repair on the side. If you advertise your services as an IT contractor that is a woman with a disability it might actually get you more work. When it come to coding there are two routes you can go. You can try to get generalized knowledge that will help you find work but then youre competing with lot of people or you can get specialized knowledge that means that there will be less work available but it will be higherpaying and there will be less competition. Unless you have a year to learn an exotic language I suggest focusing on the common popular stuff that you can make part of your independent IT contractor portfolio of services. Things like installing and configuring Wordpress setting up automated backup solutions etc. Best of luck!,WorkOnline,cx0z08e,1,t5_2y178

OP uses desperate graduates to do the work perhaps people who graduated with liberal arts majors who cant even find work in a Starbucks. These people will slave away to do the work at the advertised rate. Now there are thousands of people under this situation a degree no job living with parents and a ton of student debt. OP then uses the fact that he only hires north american college grads as his writers in his marketing toward article buyers. I dont think his payment structure is outrageous.

7447671,0,t3_4hawwv,Your formal title e.g. web developer software engineer etc. doesnt really matter as a freelancer. Youre selling a service not you. Youre selling the ability to create a website which fulfills the needs of whoever it is that is requesting that from you. Whether you personally make it or not is not really relevant. If a template fulfills those needs then there is no issue but make sure the template you are using allows you to use it for commercial purposes. Many templates will require you to pay for the template or a package of templates before you use them for commercial purposes. If you can secure work and your work is fulfilling the persons needs I would not say anyone is being taken advantage of.What is going to make it difficult for you is your proficiency seems low and you havent demonstrated a grasp on domain e.g. website.com hosting i.e. the server the website will be hosted on and email e.g. emailwebsite.com solutions which most people are going to want bundled in with their website work. The other thing is theres a lot of talented people making websites and further theres a lot of managed website creators e.g. Squarespace that you are competing with that are fairly low maintenance and low cost. You should probably head over to rwebdev and its FAQ for more information. Im not a professional web developer but I do it as a hobby.As the more technically literate younger generation gets older the basic coding skills required to be proficient in HTML and CSS are going to be very prevalent so I would look to master those as soon as possible and move on to more complex skills e.g. JavaScript PHP Python etc. I would highly recommend taking programming designcomputer science courses for basic programming skills in your community college as that experience will be more valuable than a fluffy web design class that teaches you about HTML and CSS which can be learned very quickly on places like CodeAcademy,WorkOnline,d2or4a8,6,t5_2y178

11497774,0,t1_dfz6kdh, per audio hour is an insult. No one should take a job like that. These transcription companies are well aware that the industry standard is  for clearly dictated audio which is not often the case. That means assuming the audio is clear and uncomplicated i.e. no accents people not talking over each other that it would take one hour to transcribe  minutes of audio. For audio that is more complexthere are multiple speakers or accents background noise echoes a lot of research needed it can easily take  hours to transcribe an hour of audio instead of . So a company paying only  per audio hour knows that its paying AT MOST  an hour and most likely not even that since many audios take far far longer. That hour assumes not only is the audio clear but there is no proof reading needed which is not always the case. Shame on whatever company is exploiting you and others like this. There is no excuse for it other than pure unadulterated greed.,WorkOnline,dfz9t8y,6,t5_2y178
