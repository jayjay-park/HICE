I played it a pretty solid number of times and I still dont really know what the Awful Panther is for outside of ramming the sweet fuck out of other scouts in spectacular fashions.  I would say passive scouting but even at that its not particularly great.  The high profile means you have to get the right size bushes and even then the view range isnt anything great when youre up against Tier s.  It is the highest DPM available for the Konisch which I guess can be nice if you could somehow flank people without being obliterated in the process and evne then youll probably have to use gold to pen.I think the whole reason to run the Awful Panther is to hope you get huge amounts of luck and end up in top tier  then your gun actually turns out kind of nice.

It can be seen as a logical move as Germany had a tendency to turn its tank platforms to TDs Pz. III  StuG III Pz. IV  JgPz. IV etc. They apparently did their research on the JgPz. E when making it up and found a JagdPanther type casemate would overload the front suspension so they moved it to the back.

268759,0,t3_1x6ncx,I enjoyed the Black Prince  its almost like an introduction to the hull down capability of the Caernarvon which plays like a fat Centurion with the good side armor that the Caern lacks. The Caernarvons pdr is epic as it has superior aiming characteristics to the Centurion Is pdr although it can be frustrating that youre still using gun calibers found on medium tanks. I wouldnt mind putting the BP back into my garage.I dont recommend free exping to the Conqueror as the stock Conq is a fully upgraded Caern with increased reload and a larger health pool. The Conq turret is worse than the stock Centurion turret Caerns turret is a Cent turret in regards to armor especially its massively reduced mantlet size weight and turret traverse for only a negligible . second faster reload. Its also a larger profile than the Cent turret both frontally and side. Do free exp the turret and gun and suspension if youre not going to purchase the suspension equipment as soon as possible although the pdr can work at Ts and s the Conqueror is not a suitable platform for it due to its typical opposition and top speed. The Conqueror shares the high tier ammo rack position issues that other British tanks have its on the left hand side of the lower glacis with your driver sitting on the right hand side of said glacis as well as the front half of the left side of the hull. Safe stowage on the loader is recommended but you can do without wet ammo rack. Never turn left around a corner in the Conq because of this.I love the Conqueror but it doesnt feel like it can carry a game when its asked to the armor is too insufficient to call it a heavy with artillery likely to penetrate it anywhere other than the front and its terrible at side scraping. The Conq can very easily dish out k damage when its left alone and supporting true heavies or TDs with high caliber abysmal reload guns. I find its favorite platoon partners to be heavy armors or fast mediums although I have not tried a Conqueror platoon.I have not purchased or played the b so I cant offer advice on that front.,WorldofTanks,cf8m83f,2,t5_2s113

A yellow player might take that to mean be in the fight and only peek out when you know you can get a shot in. A blue player will know that taking damage equal to whats handed out is a bad exchange. And a unicum would be constantly moving flexing and supporting without taking risks because he knows the map knows which bushes are safe to fire from where the best hulldown positions are and when to leave them etc. YMMVAnd I will wildly YOLO into the enemy like a maniac because it infuriates the two unicums that Im with picking up k damage out of the enemy team because they expect everyone to camp and save HP.,WorldofTanks,cf8q6yx,4,t5_2s113

283052,0,t1_cf9ify7,You could also argue that this provides incentive to grind and upgrade even more though so people become invested in this game.    Currently the way it is its set up that tier  and  are  whetting the appetites of the new players. Everything can pen and see each other basically. No real tactics involved just tanks shooting tanks. Basically just a place for people to run around get used to the game and not worry about stats or mechanics or anything.  Then at tier  it starts introducing the  tier spread so you start seeing tier s that you cant do anything to. People know what the research system in this game is by now otherwise they would literally not be at tier  lol so I actually imagine less people thinking I cant do anything I quit and more people thinking I want that tank so I can be invincible.    Besides that though I dont think they should keep the  spread past tier . Otherwise people will grow too accustomed to it. If you introduce them to  spread too late theyll feel ripped off. Say that they introduce  spread at tier . Theyll be accustomed to only seeing a tier above themselves and already having gone basically have the tech tree expect the second half of the tree to play similarly to how their experiences have been so far. All of a sudden youre thrown into a tier  game and youre sitting there not knowing what to do. You have no carefree environment to experience it anymore. Instead youre starting to just be a detrement to the team by not knowing whats happening and the team and game is being a detrement to you because you dont have a proper nonconsequential environment to figure out and learn whats happening.     Tier  offers that environment. No one really cares if you win or lose at tier  so its a nice place to learn some basic stuff like how you cant fight tanks  tiers up. Take your specific case for example. You pinged off a KV in a Medium III  times. You did no damage and probably didnt get much exp but you still probably earned enough to research a module or two or you probably still made a noticeable dent in the experience you still needed to research the next tank. Imagine not knowing about the  tier spread but now youre in a Churchill I. Youre sitting there dinging off the front of an angled KV. What now? Now winning matters so your team is dependent on you to know whats happening and you dont. You become a huge detrement and handicap for your team who you may ask for help but all most will say is noob or dumbass. After the game you see you made almost no exp and therefore the grind is going to take absolutely forever. Its just not a good situation.    TLDR its better to introduce  tier matchmaking spread earlier rather than later. There are less consequences at tier  to experiment and learn about the  tier spread and it actually encourages you to actively try to upgrade and advance up the tree.,WorldofTanks,cfa3oyo,1,t5_2s113

349357,0,t3_1y38zl,Yes the Chaffee is certainly competitive against the Leopard even without the upgraded gun though that certainly makes it easier. Depending on your preference pick up some binocs and a camonet or optics instead. Do try to not be the first to rush into battle. Nearly every Leopard Luchs M or Chaffee I see just rushes across to the enemy spawn as fast as they can die and accomplish nothing. Congrats youve spotted the enemies but its  seconds into battle no enemy is in position your spotting is useless to us and now were down a gun. You shouldve played enough to know where typical deployment for both sides ends up get into a position that lets you see the enemies and as both sides get closer we know where all the enemy tanks are. You can safely back off then and let the fight develop. When you see an opening to break past harass the enemy tanks from their backs distract their guns and scurry away again with their guns pointing the wrong way to the tanks they were fighting originally.That in my opinion is good work in a light tank.

378783,0,t3_1yfard,OP I think you got the words award and reward mixed up.As I would define it an award is a thing that has extrinsic value pertaining to whatever you got it for. For instance if you a nd place at the beauty pageant trophy it serves primarily as a symbol of your achievement.A reward on the other hand does not specifically pertain to your achievement and is more utilitarian in nature. Being given money or a car or a house... Those would all be rewards.There can be some overlapping that goes on between these two definitions but it basically just boils down to symbolism vs. usefulness.So theres your answer A mastery badge is symbolic having essentially no use It is an award. A credit bonus for a mastery badge would be more useful than anything so that would be a reward.Anyway not all dictionaries totally agree with me but those are a couple of distinctions that I find keep things the most simple.,WorldofTanks,cfk0ykk,3,t5_2s113

391810,0,t1_cfkxz4r,Eh I wouldnt necessarily consider it brawling. I would especially not consider saying that to someone unfamiliar with the mechanics of armor and the finite details like anglingsidescraping. Technically yes you can trade a few shots with a medium hell Ive traded shots with a KV and won but its not recommended especially to a new player. The tank can take a few hits but after brawling with any somewhat competent player youll be pretty much reduced to a oneshot kill. Try and watch some youtube videos QuickybabyBohemian Eagle AKA Jingles thatll teach you how to properly flankoutmaneuver the larger heavy tanks. This guns surprisingly effective against heavies even when facing them head on but it really shines when you get behindbeside the enemy tanks when theyre not focusing on you at all. With your decent damage but more importantly high rate of fire you should be able to easily shred a KV with the help of teammates to pieces before hes even able to line up a shot on you. One of the most important things you need to do with this tank is learn the maps and get a feeling for the flow of the battle. Knowing when to flank and where is the difference between you doing  damage and doing  damage.,WorldofTanks,cfldkzo,1,t5_2s113
392066,0,t3_1yjblp,There is a use for winchance I believe. It provides an at a glance picture of how the battle will unfold. When one sees very low odds much more conservative play is required as the probability that the front you are not on collapses.Can you get the information by studying the individual player stats?

423567,0,t3_1yw3ic,Ive seen it four or five times in a mix of heavy tanks and assault tank destroyers T PT. While most of the team tends to commit to the hills the decisive action seems to be in the town the west base tends to be more successful taking the town while the east team seems to be able to take the north more easily and should defend the town while the rest of the team breaks through. The central hill in the middle the south bank of the river approaching the west base seems to become important in the middle to endgame so defending from the northern assault depends largely on how exhausted both sides are from the opening push.

509315,0,t1_cfy2ex7,Cruiser TankgtLike the ships of the same name cruiser tanks were intended to be fast and mobile and operate independently. In this case the independence was not from other ships in a fleet but independence from the slowmoving infantry their heavier infantry tanks and artillery.gtOnce gaps had been punched in the enemy front by the infantry tanks the cruisers were intended to penetrate to the rear attacking lines of supply and communication in accordance with the theories of J.F.C. Fuller P.C.S. Hobart and B.H. LiddellHart. The cruiser tank was designed to be used in way similar to cavalry in its heyday and thus speed was a critical factor and to achieve this the early cruiser designs were lightly armoured and armed.wiki linkInfantry TankgtThe infantry tank was a concept developed by the British and French in the years leading up to World War II. Infantry tanks were designed to support foot soldiers in the attack. To achieve this the vehicles were generally heavily armoured to allow them to operate in close concert with infantry even under heavy fire. The extra armour came at the expense of speed which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow moving infantry. wiki link,WorldofTanks,cfy5uae,2,t5_2s113

That being said chatting can also be counterproductive.IMO in order to make it really work you need to follow certain guidelines be brief. Noone is reading through your elaborate plan for victory and noone will follow your totally interesting battle plan that you lay out in  lines of chat.  dont give orders. This is not clanwars you just look like an ass.  explain your action. This is what helps the team the most. If you plan to push a lane say so. If you want to hold the line tell your team.

524797,0,t1_cfzu3af,I find all the drama in this rather funny but at the same time rather ridiculous. What you have stated over and over is true through your research you found that the mods you were using were NOT in violation of the rules that have been stated to the users of this game.Of course it can be argued that people have different views opinions and definitions of each rule which is more than likely why you were banned. WGNA in their opinion thought that you were in violation of the rules so the appropriate action was to ban you on the spot. But as soon as this news spread on reddit and the forums it was apparent that the act of permanently banning you while not clearly stating a illegal mod list was a mistake on their part and the permanent ban was moved to a much lesser punishment.I guess what Im trying to say to you is well... Thanks. You have taken the bullet for the community as a whole here due to this event we are getting a proper illegal mod list which will prevent the banning of hundreds of thousands of players due to confusions about legal and illegal mods.

657303,0,t3_21o8cn,I dont quite think this is as bad of a thing as you are making it out to be. You are not constantly aiming at the most vulnerable part of every tank regardless of where that vulnerability is. All it is doing is putting the reticule closer to the center of mass. If you are in front of an AT it sure as hell isnt aiming at the commanders hatch. Its aiming right in the center. Maybe it aims for the most vulnerable spot on YOUR favorite tank but I highly doubt it does for every tank.I also think they did it more for the smaller faster tanks like the   for example. When youre trying to flank you want to get in do as much damage as you can as fast as possible and get the fuck out. It makes sense in this case to aim at wherever it has the highest chance to hit namely the center of mass. Unless my crew is drunk they sure as shit arent gonna think grazing the top of the engine compartments gonna do anything besides scratch paint. Hell autoaim is so ineffective right now that I would have shots bounce off light tanks because it hardly aims low enough to hit the turret let alone anything else on the tank.This auto aim change really makes it easier to play lights and some mediums which isnt necessarily a bad thing. It takes a lot of concentration skill and luck to be an effective scout and the auto aim buff lowers the learning curve a bit. Skilled players will still be able to aim for weak spots and new players will be more effective in their random battles. It also makes fighting other scout tanks a lot less frustrating.TLDRAutoaim got a bit better because it makes sense for your crew to aim where it will actually hit the tank instead of grazing the top of the engine compartment. Its not as big of a deal as you think it is. If the person is autoaiming in something that can fearlessly stare down the barrel of an E theyre doing it wrong anyway.EDIT Also that video kinda shows something pretty fishy here. That E is parked on a HILL. This means that your tiny T has to aim UPWARDS from that angle to hit the center of mass. You completely sensationalized the problem. Well done OP. Thats some gradeA shitstorm brewing tight there.,WorldofTanks,cgezgz3,10,t5_2s113

Googles answer due to impatienceVsync keeps the frame rate the same as the refresh rate fo your monitor hence no tearing If your GPU is pushing more FPS than the refresh rate then Vsync is better turned on in my opinion but then i dont like tearing in games.... It will have no effect on the power consumption if you turn it on... You cannot see FPS...unless you are talking about something like Fraps which is showing you tthe FPS whilst you are playing.. Once it goes over a certain amount you do not see any more as that is the speed that your eyes and brain can see and calculate... I have heard people say that some can see a higher FPS than others but am yet to see proof of this In my honest opinion fps is no different to me than fps or  fps but then maybe that is all my brain can cope with lol...  FPS is commonly used as the bare minimum a Game should run at for smooth gameplay! i like this figure for RTS RPG MMO games but do prefer  for Shooters though.

698912,0,t1_cgjnr9k,Kinda. The exposed roof armor is now a lot closer to being autobounce instead of being a weakspot. The weaker parts of the gun mantlet are smaller but also weaker. The edges around the gun mantlet are a bit more exposed.  degrees better slope on the upper front plate is a massive improvement.

702303,0,t1_cgjug7k,Ive seen the changes on FTR but its always a huge kneejerk reaction from SS. That is not testing. That is literally looking at the armor profile and saying ITS DIFFERENT IT MUST BE BAD. FUCK WG THEY NERFED ANOTHER TANKI see noticable changes to the tank but nothing jumps out and says its a nerf. The top of the turret got more sloping to it which means itll be able to hulldown and autobounce shots whenever aimed at. The hull is more likely to bounce shots because it has an even steeper slope than before. Until there is an actual video testing this stuff out you cannot claim based on a single persons biased viewpoint that the tank has been nerfed. SS jumps the gun at every opportunity to call WG shit and every single time people eat it up as if it were the gospel of truth. Its rarely correct and people need to start realizing that. ,WorldofTanks,cgk3rpe,2,t5_2s113

817937,1,t3_23i49d,I made a post about how I feel about arty a little bit ago hereAs a fellow arty player and enthusiast I definitely agree that arty as it is is in not a bad but a weird spot.I think the FV is a great starting point on how arty can be changed repositioning often to make good shots a lot lower damage but precise shots that count. I dont need to oneshot tanks I would be perfectly fine only dealing a bit more damage than normal tanks but being able to aim in and know Ill hit.For regular tanks take a  crew and try shooting an inaccurate gun while driving top speed. See that aim circle? Would you rather have that low chance to hit them and straight up kill them or your regular aimed in accurate shot that only does a portion of their health? Yeah the second one. I for one feel the same way about arty. Id much rather have most of my shots hit for a moderate amount of damage. that way I feel rewarded for aiming and timing my shots. Sure oneshotting tanks is amazing fun but the other  shots in between those hits that just dont do anything useful take away any fun that oneshot had.,WorldofTanks,cgx937o,1,t5_2s113

I think arty gets more hate than those other methods because people have a better understanding of how to avoid being racked or burned than they do of how to avoid being skylasered.  If you got shot and lit up then its because you stood in front of someones gun but its a lot harder to see when youre standing in front of an SPGs gun.

Of all the tanks in either of the USA TD lines the T is worst of them.  In other words its absolute shit.  Its the M Lee you have to suffer through to get the Doom Turtle.I leveled up both USA TD lines at the same too nice part is these tank lines share guns so you unlock one you unlock both.  T is vastly superior to the T in every concievable way.  But the T...even though its slower still in fact I believe its the slowest tank in the entire game is fantastically fun.  I have not got to the E yet but T is a keeper for me.  Its more of an experience you have to try for yourself than a playstyle.

849106,0,t3_23uwsg,gtAre there any deals bundles or other purchases you can make directly through the Wargaming website that you should look out for and are good value without being a special sale and are there any that you should ignore due to bad value? Dont buy special sale packages or tanks from the website with very few exceptions theyre almost always worse bangforbuck than just buying gold. The only exceptions are X goldX million credits but only if you really need the credits.Premium time and just gold is the way to go. You can choose when you spend it and its important to notice that  unmounting equipment is g.  gold. For not having to buy a kk equipment again. Thats always going to be worth it.  If you have premium time your grind times drop in half  why? Because youre earning money while youre grinding and you dont have to grind money separately. yes this is a generalizationBuying the  packages of gold is usually best value for your money. Still it all depends on how much you want to spend on the game.Id recommend never buying credits directly for gold its very hard to justify spending gold directly on that when you can get  gold worth of credits or more from one game playing with a premium tank using a premium account. Heck you can get  gold worth of credits by playing one tier  match.Personally when I started I took the attitude that this is a regular MMO and the first one I ever liked and promptly put in  to start with and  per month after that. IMO that gives you a lot of options and gold to play around with but again just me.,WorldofTanks,ch0spxp,11,t5_2s113

962420,0,t3_254u07,Just got my E had the same dilemma you did. The US Heavy line does the same thing. I have a shortage of US loaders and an excess of US Radiomen. I took another similarly experienced crew member from another tank at the time my T with  skills went with BIA. Put a new crew member in the T and used my T to get him up to speed. Can you steal  crew member  on his first skill from another preferably elited tank to throw in there and get the BIA bonus? If you take him from an elited tank then the replacmenet crew member can get the accelerated crew training bonus to get him closer to his peers soon. The T comes in very handy for getting excess loaders trained up in US tanks. I use my T and T to break in new guys getting them well on their way. Once they have some skills I transfer them off to other tanks. ,WorldofTanks,chdopro,4,t5_2s113

My Cent s HESH shells are g cheaper than the  s APCR despite doing double the avg dmg.

Ive had a couple games where I run the T with a  chance to win and wind up making just the right choices and help pull out a win and do between k dmg. Win rate is legitimate and WN can help you see who the other people are that will help the probability to pull out a win.

Turret combines ok thickness with good angles.Im hesitating to go further down this line though while the t has higher DPM a slightly more confortable gun depression better terrain resistance for about the same HPtons and a better hull armour all around. And frontal mounted turret... Hmmm... Do people reverse sidescrap with it? it has the same pen and not sure this hull armour ammounts to anything against tier IX or even VIII tanks Also frontal fuel tank whelp Yes this probably doesnt shine compared to the Comet which I have yet to master. Then again the Comet is great at least in the harsh environment of tier VII mediumsOn the other hand  but this possibly doesnt concern the XBox version  while the A looks cromwelllike the A is said to have an armour seemingly entirely made of ammo racks and engines and other modules Also horrid bad depression but can somewhat sidescrap which would take a lot to adjust toAnyway  T is down the line like the promised land of Soviet Mediums,WorldofTanks,ci3pit2,1,t5_2s113

1194592,0,t1_ci3p648,One thing I have found useful is to think about how effective your tank is versus your friendly tanks. I was in Komarin and started at the north spawn in my IS in a tier  game damnit. Tanks went their respectable way at the start with a large majority heading over to the  line. On the  line we had an IS death star T and myself. The IS and myself charged up to the barn at G in an effort to stop the charge by the other team while giving lights to the TDs in the back. We reached the barn easily enough without getting spotted but we didnt see anything or take shots either. Meanwhile on the  line our team was getting hammered by a lot of their team and starting to take losses. I would occasionally poke around the barn and hear my sixth sense go off but no firing at all. After about another  seconds I decide to side scrape and give someone a target and hope to autobounce some shots. BEEP BEEP Sixth sense goes off and I wait for another couple seconds trying to get them to light themselves. Suddenly I am hit by two different rounds quickly one from an IS and another from a Leopard . I was lucky enough to bounce the IS but the Leopard penned me. But they werent spotted... Shit... I pull back around the barn while I decide what to do.The way I saw it our  line was fading quickly and the center had been a stalemate the entire time. I had to do something but if I do I am gonna get wrecked. I surveyed the friendlies near me and made a quick plan. Out of all the friendlies on my side I was the least effective but still had some health and my repair kit in case I get tracked. I informed the TDs and IS that I will do my best to get them lights and the actually acknowledged and gave me the go ahead. I get a run at it so I am not headed around the barn at a snails pace and start moving forward all the while my friendlies eagerly await a target to show itself. I move up to the houses at H and take another shot from the Leopard but he is close enough that he appeared when he fired. Then the IS immediately afterward lands a hit and tracks me. The TDs were preaimed on that rock back at J where the Leopard finally revealed himself and he exploded as soon as he appeared by shots from the TDs waiting in the back. I had just repaired my tracks when the friendly IS started moving up to support me against the enemy IS when the enemy T decided I didnt need to drive my tank around anymore and landed a direct hit killing me. At this point I prefer to go back to the garage but I was interested to see how this one turned out. The  line had continued to hold off the impending charge and friendlies on the island had whittled the enemy down to a lone E on half health. The teamwork on the  line turned out well. Our IS ended up making the enemy IS fall back enough to let the TDs get shots on him and take out the last remaining enemy on the  line. They continued the push and were able to help with the E on the island before pushing to the forest on the J line pulling out a victory.The lesson I learned there was even though I was a heavy tank I was still effective. Maybe not by dealing damage but by initiating the push and letting the heavy hitters that can soak up more damage not get focused on early. In addition we did have a scout but he tried to cross the river in the wrong spot and drowned. In hindsight I believe it was the correct thing to do. I may have been able to do it better and not die so quickly but I was able to distract them for long enough to let our other tanks do what they do as well as initiate a push that the IS didnt seem content on starting.TLDR  T heavy in a T game can be effective in other ways rather than trying to deal as much damage as possible before getting popped by something much more dangerous than you.Edit Sorry for length. I felt it would be better if I had explained the entire situation.,WorldofTanks,ci40dr5,3,t5_2s113

1216190,0,t3_281blz,You may want to fiddle with your settings a little bit more. The game is  CPU bound but its not that awful. Whats actually happening is there are a lot of background pretty things that arent exactly necessary to gameplay that are gobbling up processing speed. I built a system using the slightly better Rana CPU you mentioned for a friend about a year ago and he plays perfectly fine with it. These are my settings for the record I play on an older computer myself it has an Intel Core  Extreme QX CPU and an AMD  GPU running everything.   You can mess with this area a little bit but it will significantly hamper performance. If there is a cosmetic thing that you like in this area you should decide whether or not its worth the performance hit. Anything lower than medium terrain quality and you WILL be shooting into the dirt and rocks. Draw distance can go up to high as well but its up to you on whether thats worth it to you.Basically anything that doesnt really add to the game should be turned off because of underpowered your CPU is. Overall you should get around FPS with this and it should remain relatively stable throughout gameplay. As an added note any XVM visual enhancements you may be using will also add to poor performance. Keep plugging along we should get the Umbra  Occlusion Culling engine within the year if were lucky. Thatll greatly increase EVERYONES FPS. ,WorldofTanks,ci6fuce,4,t5_2s113

Playing medium tanks teaches you a little about playing every other type of tank in the game and both of those lines have great tanks with a variety of uses.

1291276,0,t1_cievhpm,Well it all depends on your play style. IS is a straight brawler and hull down is basically impenetrable god awful gun though. The E is a beefy slower medium. Fast firing accurate gun with high pen good mobility good armor except for its weakspot on the top of the tank which must be hidden by its driver very good at whatever role it might need to fill. The  is just amazing. Nothing can do everything as good as the  can if that makes sense. You have the camo and DPM of a TD with some incredibly trolololol armor on a platform that can flex to any part of the map within a minute. If you have to make a decision I would say get the  and the IS but make sure you have  crews with at least . or  skills or you will be at a serious disadvantage. ,WorldofTanks,cievvgm,2,t5_2s113

The GPU isnt tasked heavily so if you only plan to play tanks then you dont need a terribly expensive one. However as I might imagine you will play other games where chances are those will ask for more GPU performance to run well in which case picking a GPU up in range of  USD will be worth while.The rest of the system isnt much  psu  mobo  ram. The rest will vary a lot depending on your personal preference  storage  case  ODD  aftermarket CPU cooler plus any other extras you might get will add to the total cost.The point is this you dont need to go crazy Im running the game on ik on stock frequencies and I get  fps no problem.

Tigers are early sniping tanks with late brawling ability if you keep your health and dont trade damage early.  Panther II is similar but with better flanking ability.  Same with the Panther.  Oh and the guns are accurate.  They will teach you how to angle your armor or die put out fires or die and play smart or die.Youre too late to the VK.H.  It was the best tier  medium tank Ive ever played.  With the long  it just decimated enemy tanks even tier  from a distance  had good speed and was just one of the most pleasurable grinds Ive ever done.  I put a brand new crew into that tank as I only bought it since I knew it was being split.  With no training no skills and a not upgraded tank it still never fell below .

1506245,0,t3_2bfu1w,If top tier and you can drive around at angles its fantastic as soon as you get into t games its sidescrape or die as soon as your spotted. The dpm is kinda lackluster but the pen is good and its sufficiently accurate but its still Russian accuracy either Stalin is with or hes not. Its also really tall so if any decent medium can close the distance and hug your side your doomed. Its also prone to sit still for large portions of matches since the tracks are almost impossible to miss usually saving you from the tank that just took them out but letting arty get a nice shot in. Equipment? Vstab rammer and vents personally though its one of the few tanks I think a spall liner might actually not be bad on but Im no Unicum so dont take that very far. Standard heavy skillsperks with an emphasis on repairs maybe a toolbox instead of vents now that I think about it. And of course we cant forget the almighty battering ram abilities of this tank. Im sure you seem some ridiculous rams but I find them to very few and far between not worth actively seeking out like Ive seen some people try but when it happens its absolutely hilarious.

1599963,0,t1_cjgelkx,I cant speak to having K damage but Ive had at least  games with  kills where Ive still lost the game and at least two  kills games that ended in draws.  Nothing left in the tank and encountering a  health base camper was enough to do me in one game.  Sometimes you can only carry so hard.Ive even had a team lemming to the city side on Westfield when I was in my Matilda starting from base.  I went left flank as its a lesser slope for the SLOW that is the Matilda.  Before I even got up the west slope my team on the right flank was all dead.  I then had some dead moron on my team start yelling that I was to blame since I hadnt raced to help them in the city up a rather steep hill.  He was so enfuriated that he started giving the enemy team my position on the west flank above our base.  At that point it was  enemy VS me alone and the game wasnt even  minutes old.  Ten kills later I couldnt catch the last LTP that I had down to  health.  Ended in a draw.  One of my best games ever and still counted as a loss.What I would like to happen since they wont ever fix the matchmaker is to not allow you to advance to the next tank until you reach Master in the current one.  That would stop an awful lot of idiots from progressing beyond tier .

1653582,0,t3_2d9f8a,The   is a huge change in gameplay from the tanks before it so it will take some getting used to.  The basic idea is to isolate a single tank and deal as much damage to it as possible.  You never want to be alone because your reload is so long that people will often rush up to kill you once you fire off your clip.  Try to follow these guidelines until you get a better sense of how the tank works   Dont engage more than one enemy gun at once.  You can peek out against a single enemy and hit him  times for every hit you take.  For each additional enemy that damage ratio drops fast.     Survive as long as possible.  Do not take risks early in the game.  Following on point  the longer the game goes the less enemy tanks will be alive.  If you find an enemy alone you can kill him probably  of the time.  Youre extremely powerful in v situations.     Dont be alone.  Ever.  You have to wait  seconds to reload depending on how good your crew is.  If you dont have some friends to hide behind youre toast.    Never take more damage than you have to.  If you can shoot a tank  times without getting hit or  times and taking a hit in return always choose the former.  Chances are you can empty those  shells into something else.  Every hit you avoid early will let you tank a hit later on to unload your whole magazine when it counts. If youre having trouble in the tank an easy way to limit the damage you take early is to snipe as much as possible in the first few minutes.  Dont worry about reloading unless you have one shot left and nothing to shoot instead try to shoot once or twice at enemy tanks in the open and then pull back.  Once the enemy team is thinned out a bit you can commit more of your health to the battle.  Experiment with this and figure out what works best for you.  ,WorldofTanks,cjnliqc,3,t5_2s113

1712570,0,t1_cjuy090,Im not in line with all the artybashing but as an old artilleryman I have to agree with you. Indirect fire with a real howitzer isnt remotely like WoT. Every shot at a different spot requires someone to calculate bearing elevation and possibly how much propellant is used. A moving tank being hit by a single howitzer shooting HE over a hill is about as likely as being hit by a meteor. Its also very unrealistic how much damage they do. A grand total of  of all tanks knocked out in WW were due to indirect artillery fire. Artillery often made tanks move or go away because tankers hate having their sights broken and their kit shredded but even mm shells rarely penetrated armour.But  if realism were the standard half the tanks in the game would disappear.   ,WorldofTanks,cjv15gr,10,t5_2s113

I had a hatehate relationship with that tank. That top gun is the most goddamn troll gun ever and if you even get spotted your engine is knocked out. True story.All three are pretty similar tanks. The T has turret armor which is nice. But while its agile its Chinese and as such the engine is a bit weedy particularly after its damaged like I mentioned. You cant hit shit with the gun unless youre at point blank range and even then you frequently hear SerB cackling with glee.The T is more mobile and has a FAR better gun at the expense of anything resembling armor. The gun handling is dreamy with the exception of the reload. The only real complaint about the T is the handling feels a bit stiff to me.The Comet is the happy nexus between the T and the T. No armor per se but the gun mantlet lets you troll while hull down. The RoF is nice while the pen and alpha are adequate. Its speedy its reasonably agile and it also has pretty good camo.Ill never sell my Comet. I like it so much I dont drive my T as much any more. And I gave the T a fair trial. I really did. Aside from quite literally  or  GOOD games out of the  games I drove it I hated driving it.

A gorgeous gun with incredibly high DPM good pen and great dispersion and aim time. Its also fast and mobile isnt usually on fire or ammoracked like its predecessors and isnt bad looking either. The Leopard  is also really fun to play. Its got a lovely gun when its aimed is as fast as a bat and far more mobile. Its challening thanks to lack of armour which means you actually have to think about your gameplay instead of going full retard and coming out alive with k damage like a .

1860401,0,t1_ckct414,The terrain resistance and traverse buff were there to offset the loss of the engine and overall resulted in slower acceleration and traverse anyway. Cant remember the numbers on the gun buff so I cant really comment on that. The mm armor was totally workable in some ways I even preferred it because the E isnt a tank that I can constantly keep hull down. I would argue that the changes resulted in a slightly more passive playstyle for the tank with acceleration and uphill movement reducing its overall mobility.But really the engine nerf Im more bitter about is the placement of the transmission behind the lfp. Another nerf to mobility with the lfp being the primary target in the front of the tank.gtI mean the E wasnt considered much of anything at all prior to that patch and now its basically like every stat padders dream.I dont know what it was considered to be but what it was was the first german medium that played more like a brawler than a sniper. Its somewhere between a heavy and a medium now and certainly does it pretty well but I personally preferred the old playstyle. Cant remember whether silvergold was available back then so that might obviously affect my view on this.TL DR The effective playstyle changed slightly and I liked the old one better. Did people really think it wasnt a fantastic tank before?EDIT I have to add that its been a long time since I played the old E obviously so I might be romanticizing the memory a bit. Its definitely not a bad tank now like I said still one of my favorite tanks but I remember having several barrels of laughs with the old one.,WorldofTanks,ckddfst,1,t5_2s113

The only real notably useful piece is the mantlet on the second turret which is just about as good as the Indiens. The tracks are about as useful as the Pershings in that it sometimes absorbs shots if you position it correctly. It fits my style since Im used to trading HP instead of bouncing as often as I would like from my Leopard .It gets better trust me. Once you get the engine and the second turret youll realize how great a tank it is even if the gun platform part looks deceiving on paper. You can just absolutely rocket the rounds out. The rd gun is just a bonus to increase your viability against targets with the good standard penetration. I average at least  damage on a win if Im left unchecked and I love my little mark of excellence on the gun.

Find a good bush which will hide you from where the enemys line of sight will be and just sit still.  If you shoot if you move if they come within m of you youll be seen.

2040022,0,t1_ckz48y4,No my friend you are dismissing the point. Ive repeatedly tried to keep you on track. My opening statement and in every comment since Ive been trying to argue that Edrard knows shit about this issue and his analysis is shit. Yet again yes only WG knows the true values of exactly how many games are won  or . HOWEVER sites such as VBaddict can give us an accurate estimation. LEGITIMATE STATISTICAL TOOLS such as MONTECARLO SIMULATIONS can give us surprising accurate estimates. There are multiple ways that we as nonWG employees can obtain a REASONABLE estimate for data values relevant to this issue. Edrard used none of these. That is my issue. My further issue was that FTR posted this article claiming he is a high and mighty statistician in the WoTsphere while he actually fails the basic requirements of logic and rhetorical arguments. This is unacceptable. In order to prove this to you Ive time and time again shown you other methods with which we could legitimately obtain accurate estimates. When I offered to actually put the effort in to do one myself you evaded by saying that WG does not use wn. Unsurprisingly given your previous argumentative style and support of Edrard that comment has no bearing on the argument on hand. In fact many people consider wn to be far superior in many ways to PR or WR alone. Let me break down your argument line by line because Im afraid youll misunderstand or try to evade again I think Ive sufficiently covered the first line already so lets move on to line .gt Only WG knows what the current values are NOW. Because only they have the data!Thats true but has no bearing on this argument. In many well established and respected fields we primarily use estimates not  correct and verifiable data. Chemistry Nuclear Physics and even Statistics primarily use estimations from data at hand in order to draw conclusions. This is very similar to what I proposed and the fact that I cant get the EXACT answer doesnt stop me from estimating a solution that is in all reality within a sufficient significant difference from the true answer. This is the same process thats well established and relied on in many scientific fields.gt Wargaming does not use WN as a rating metric... They use personal rating and Winrate  that we know of.WN is widely considered a more rigorous metric of skill than PR or WR. It even superseded the highly flawed Efficiency rating which supposedly lends this Edrard character his credentials. However if you truly believe that PR is a better metric than WN if you want me to do a montecarlo simulation with PR I will be able to do that as well. It makes no difference. You just need to provide me with the percentage of players that are at each PR value similar to the chart on this page and with a difference value that to you would define a blowout or a close game. If you cant give me these values or cant legitimately argue that a montecarlo simulation would not be appropriate to this situation or this data set then youve lost this argument and must concede that Edrard sucks balls when it comes to arguing against SBM. ,WorldofTanks,ckz4rj1,0,t5_2s113

2138446,0,t3_2jguyh,I freaking loved my T. But its an autoloader and you have to obey the laws of autoloaders.. Never be first Anywhere!  You are not a scout you dont have the armor to lead a charge. You cant circle strafe your way out of danger. You are a second line burst damage force multiplier. . Never be alone Ever!  Once you clip out you are very vulnerable. You need to have backup to protect you while you reload. . I forget what the rd one is. The tank has good mobility and its all about burst damage. The whole point is putting yourself in a position where you can clip out minimize exposure to fire and repeat. You should never try and trade shots. Its all about managing your HP vs. the HP of the enemy tank. Ill take one of yours to give you  of mine. Hanging out for the th shot usually gets you hit twice. You dont want that. If you are supporting a flank only expose your tank if there is one enemy best after he has fired so you get maximum time to land your  shots or th if its a kill shot before he reloads Dont Yolo tanks with more HP than  of your shots can produce. Count on at least one bouncing if youre going in for the kill. This tank is an excellent finisher. So thats it. Early game is sniping or supporting the more mobile flank with second line burst damage. Late game is finishing damaged tanks. If youre shooting them in the front then you are doing it wrong. Charge take one hit and plant as many as you can in their side armor before they reload. Part Deux The LoadoutYour modules equipment and crew skills have to all work together to minimize the shit gun handling. So Vert StabilzerGLDVents are not optional they are freaking MANDATORY. Youre gonna need all this equipment for TE so its not a waste of silver.  The crew skills Snap Shot on your gunner and Smooth Ride for your driver are also mandatory. Clutch Breaking is also recommended. It really makes the T a lot more agile and fun. I put Sixth Sense and Jack of All Trades on my Commader so I could ditch the Medpack and add a large repair kit. Oh and Safe Stowage on your loader is mandatory. This thing gets ammo racked constantly. Its why I run a small and large repair kit. Oh and get over it.

The dmg is too small the tank is too big and Im not too good. I cannot carry games with it. I can support good teams and thats all.Itd be nice to have something that actually has some armor and does have a punch. I adore the ISIS because its relatively mobile and shoots well. I dislike the KV because of the mobility issues. I love the T T the VKd these tanks just click. The M the E the covenanter however do not. So I dont know what makes a good medium tank for me. Im not even sure I can play mediums well most good players I see are hyper aggressive move all the time and have this spastic playstyle when behind cover moving back and forth all the time. I cant play like this as I dont know how.Just tried the Chinese light line on the test server and it looks quite fun... paper tanks with BIG guns.This is why Im worried about getting the T.

2222370,0,t3_2kkgxs,WTE is a HUGE target with nonexistent armorcamo. Your only defense is the fear of your immense clip damage vast view range and your decent  hp pool. Like any usual autoloaders you have to conserve and trade away your hp pool smartly.    Is it worth eating a  damage shot to clip the fullhealth unicum TA? Very likely YES.    A  damage shot for the fullhealth unicum E? Likely yes.    Is it worth taking  damage and artillery fire to clip a lowWR tier ? Very likely NO.    The tier  WT should have trained you well in backing out of cover for a shot. It is common sense for the WT TDs to cover as much of the tank as possible to give your enemies a small as possible target. It may mean the difference between a .cm HE shell smashing into you or missing you entirely. You also protect your engine driver fuel and drive sprockets this way. It would be good for you to get used to flipping WT TDs around like second nature.    My last advice is to try to stick with allies. Its better to let your allied IS bounce that JPE AP shell instead of you taking that damage yourself. Also always mentally have an escape route to safety if shit ever hits the fan for you and it usually will.Edit Spelling,WorldofTanks,clmbek6,7,t5_2s113

2231270,0,t3_2kp1yj,Here are some tanks to avoid for your first couple thousand games because They require a higher skill level to do well in They are really poor for their tier and thus more difficult to play There are better tanks to learn the game in You will hate your life while grinding themPanzer  A amp D. Poor armor for their tier no other redeeming qualities.DW. Very bad tier  heavy honestly all tier  heavies are bad. Gun is poor armor nonexistent no mobility. Leads to the VK . H which is also poor stock though elite it is good.Panzer III line. Subpar there are better teachers. The  is probably the worst tier  medium. Tier  lights. Most light tanks starting at tier  get scout matchmaking. This means instead of seeing tanks two tier above them they see tanks  tiers above them. You are expected to find the enemy and not suicide scout. This is difficult for new players it was for me. Once you know some of the game mechanics these are very fun but wait for a bit. A. The BTs are amazing. The A is crap. Grind to the T via another line I am going via the T. There are some higher tier tanks that require great skill but these are the ones from tiers  that are going to give you a bad impression of the game.

I thought a have time because I read somewhere that the giveaway is running till th November. And today I was happy to finally see that the giveaway page finally loads. And then its expired.Kinda sad not having the chance to get a key because the page didnt load despite good net connection.

Ive played Stalingrad twice now so my experience on it is low but from what I can tell its very difficult to move around as you are always running into dead ends. Perhaps this was the intent of the map design to create corridors within city streets but it ends up resulting in a lot of confusion. That being said as players play the map more we will get used to the choke points and avenues to exploit but getting back to your original point Kharkov was a map that was immediately intuitive. Where you thought you could go to flank you actually could and in some cases you found a surprise trap door.

2299455,0,t3_2lln0w,You can do a lot in a light tank even in higher tiers. Start the game by spotting enemy movement while staying alive. Keep tanks lit so your team mates can safely shoot them from a distance. When an enemy tanks health is low and they are alone or you are out of crossfire you use the speed of light tank to flank and kill the enemy with shots to the rear side and other weak points of the tank. I also like to use autolock and stay on the move taking shot on the side or rear of tanks while out running their turret so they cant get shots on me. I also like to distract tanks I know I cant pen so they turn their turret towards me leaving an opening for a teammate to attack. Light tanks are very team dependent. I have many games where Im at the bottom of this list starting and end up on the top of battle result with more damage then the top tier tanks.,WorldofTanks,clvxgfp,5,t5_2s113

2495057,0,t1_cmk89ku,The Ts major advantage over the T is the turret.  Its harder to hit than the Ts because its smaller and its harder to penetrate when you do hit it because its hard all the way around rather than just at the front and also because the cupola is much lessinviting a weak spot.  This means that instead of having to always present your front to the enemy as you do in the T you are free to direct fire in a range of directions without undue risk.  This makes you much more threatening and much harder to surround.  Also since you mention it the relative agility of the T makes you much more able to dodge incoming artillery fire thus avoiding another of the Ts vulnerabilities.  ,WorldofTanks,cmk8q00,3,t5_2s113

Wish that came earlier  in a tier where a lot of people rush in a straight line with  crews.Cruiser Mk III is clearly the superior tank best tier II tank overall ? but as Jjuonio pointed out it means a dedicated seal clubbing crew  I have a  winrate with the Tet   points above my overall  and a  wn which I could oppose to your often very useless assesment and your expcted values remark but you could retort in turn that might do better with the Mk III I mean if I came back to it now that I dont play like an utter moron anymore. as of now I have a grand  WN with that tank .

2544018,0,t1_cmql7aw,For the RU heavies both are viable all the way to tier . If youre interested in clan wars the faster line is the way to go IS is much more mobile than IS without giving up too much in the way of armor. How to play mediums well is a much harder question. Its hard to give a simple answer because so much of it depends on the situation. The best thing to do in a medium is to watch where the enemy is and then shoot them from unexpected places using your mobility to always keep them guessing. This can mean anything from shooting from bushes to flanking to just getting yourself seen so they turn towards you and your heavies have better shots on them. Its probably the most situational awareness dependent class in the game but also the one that can affect the tide of battle the most if played well.For more concrete advice heres a good guide that I saw posted on reddit a while back. Do keep in mind that much of his map specific advice is outdated as the maps have changed since. Also that is a very aggressive playstyle for mediums. It can be absurdly effective once you get the hang of it but is tough and can easily lead to useless deaths. The hardest part of playing a medium any tank really just mediums moreso is balancing the line of aggression to affect the game and caution to stay alive so you can be impactful late game where your flexibility shines.,WorldofTanks,cmqn22f,1,t5_2s113

Thats just a monstrosity. I cant even bear to imagine what a TOG II is like if a Tiger II is that big.,WorldofTanks,cnfgg2n,2,t5_2s113
2741191,0,t1_cnfe3hx,I wouldnt be so sure about the idea of it getting preferential MM.The reason is the comparison to the pdr found as the top gun on many tanks in tiers  similarly to the way we find the L as the top gun on a lot of tier  German tanks.There are  premium tanks with the pdr.  The Churchill III the Matilda BP and the Ram II.  The first two get pref MM while the Ram does not.  Those with pref MM have such terrible mobility they need to be able to penetrate from the front as theyll never get in position to shoot a side or rear.  The ram however does have the added agility so it gets to see tier .  It will still have some trouble penning owntier tanks in the front and it needs to use that gun against tier s.Now theres only two premiums with the L the jagdtiger and the panther.  JT gets pref MM panther does not.  I think the best comparison we can really make to the L without pref MM is the panther II so lets just see where the panther falls on some key stats between the JT and the panther II. Mobility kmh vs kmh vs kmh.  Well we start off somewhere in the middle.  Its much closer to the panther II though and  can get you into and out of positions fast enough for most purposes.  The panthers also share the same backwards speed limit  while the JT has barely more than half that .  But wait theres more to mobility than just speed limits lots of tanks have speed limits they cannot reach.  Plus what about turning?  Well in this case we see the panthers are even more similar than before and in a couple places the panther is even better.  The panthers have almost  more horsepower per tonne although the panther II has . more giving it an edge here.  However the panther appears to have better terrain resistance AND better hull traverse.  kmh is a lot in this game and thats a huge advantage the panther II has over the panther but so far Im not seeing a very strong case for pref MM on the panther. Firepower  I could probably make this section as long as the previous one but Im going to try not to.  Since they all use the same gun penetration and damage are the same but we get different numbers for accuracy and rate of fire.  Simply put the Jtiger has the best values for all these stats and the panther II has the worst.  The panther is just allaround better with its gun than the normal MM panther II I dont see that as an argument for pref MM although I suppose it is worse than the jt which has pref MM in every way which may at least cancel out that better than standard tank argument Armour Can I be even shorter here?  JT gt Panther II gt Panther.  Important notes  guns which are pretty popular on tier  mediums will double overmatch the side of the panther but not the panther II and the JPE and british TDs and anything else Im forgetting between mm and mm will double overmatch the front of one but not the other. Turrets JT doesnt have one panthers do.  This is huge as its a lot easier to shoot someone around a corner without getting shot back and allows you to circle tanks.  Also the panther has better turret traverse speed than the panther II.I just dont see a realistic argument for the panther to be brought down to the MM level of the JT.  Its as good or better than the panther II in most areas.  Yes that kmh difference is huge and I suppose being better able to sidescrape but is it enough to say that the faster one should see tier s while the other doesnt?  Unless you want to try to argue that the panther II should be buffed while the panther  stays at the same level and that the JT either needs even better MM or a buff then the panther seems fine the way it is.TLDR Buff the AT .,WorldofTanks,cnfnucm,2,t5_2s113

2852996,0,t1_cnscjv7,Never driven one myself but from my Hundo experience its kinda hard to keep it ready when youve got a  second reload. You shoot what youve got before the target disappears or you force a switch and be useless for the next half minute. Paying close attention to the map helps but youre still going to find yourself with the wrong round loaded for the target and the above choice to make a couple times a game. That inflexibility is pretty killer.If youre not driving it exclusively for its HESH youd be far better off with a JgPzE. You trade a bit of alpha damage and a fake turret for a real gold round far better gun handling and useful ammounts of armor.,WorldofTanks,cnsdwto,3,t5_2s113

For most noobs this means they rush towards the frontline be the first one lighted up and die...This is obviously not what the speed of meds is for.So whats it for you ask? For flanking!But flanking has a secret that only unicums know  it is impossible right at the beginning of the game. So you need to wait out fo the game develop. If you look at good players playing meds unless  Bat Chat platoons as only top tiers on steppes they play it VERY cautiously at the beginning. In the first half of the game some damage is nice super unicums do quite some damage even there but your HPs are MUCH more important!Only when the game has developed and you are at the point where you know or strongly suspect where each and every enemy tank is   then you start to flank. It is only now that you use the speed of meds to get into the best position  whats the best position is again Unicum stuff.So now you know the very basic principle of playing meds.,WorldofTanks,cntnemi,1,t5_2s113

3044790,0,t1_codkhnn,Flanks are already plenty relevant. Youre supposed to have to hold them on a large map that would be impossible since to hold all of the available flanks youd completely lose any one that got significant pressure put on it and the map would be too big to reroute forces to do more than get mowed down as they got there.At long range and moving a Light is almost impossible to hit and effective view range against a for example M on the move is around  meters assuming full camo skill on the crew camo paint and nothing else including bushes. On a  by  map that means you need a line of  scouts with completely unobstructed sight lines to so much as spot any Lights making an end run for your back line never mind actually stop them.Thats just way too easy to pull off and get around. If youre platooned then you have three Lights or fast mediums blitz one scout who is now dead and then dive into the back line. If people turn around to deal with them thats less guns pointing toward the inevitable heavy push and if just the Lights or Mediums go back then thats less guns and theyre probably going to get picked off unless they group up first by which time the Arty is dead.Trust me Ive played games similar to World of Tanks that tried big maps. Mechwarrior Online being the best example and  of those bigs maps is completely unused because if you try anything clever the enemy deathball runs over your allies and them mops you up unless the entire team tries for clever in which case you either spend half the match barely seeing each other until someone gets bored and charges or its a race to cap and no one even shoots at each other. So everyone just meets at the rough center of the map fights over the big tactically significant piece of ground and the map ends up a big waste of space whose only distinguishing feature over a smaller map is the big walk to get to where the shooting starts.,WorldofTanks,codlb7u,1,t5_2s113

Compare them and youll find thats not the only change they apparently made. Look at the density of the hits in the outer four rings. There are several times more shots that land in the outer rings on the . plot than the . plot. The reason I was of the opinion it was a buff was based on these graphs. I personally would rather have the . pattern than the . one at least as illustrated by these two graphs.The one in the video today by contrast does agree with WGs description.

In this case they hold a deterrent role i.e. make the good players in the other team cant contribute to the game while his team takes care of the scrubs.On the other hand if we take your assumption then the fact that he focuses on you is good for your team because you have now attracted a dangerous sky cancer away from your team so that your teammates can take care of the other.

3210654,0,t1_couiswy,Yup hence why tankers generally used the term knocked out rather than destroyed. Knocked out just means it stopped shooting back and didnt leave the battlefield. A good example is Tiger  that was knocked out by a shell bouncing off its gun and impacting the roof and turret ring jamming the turret in place and causing the crew to abandon the vehicle.Actually one of the key concepts of the modern MBT is the American WW concept of Rapid Maintenance. Compared to the German and Russian tanks the US Shermans were amazingly easy to service and repair which meant that if the tank hadnt burned or exploded they could probably turn it back into a working vehicle. This has since been applied to most modern MBT designs. For example the Abrams has a very modular engine design. It still needs a crane and a maintenance bay as opposed to the Shermans which basically just needed  fairly strong people and something to undo the bolts but you can find videos on Youtube of the entire engine just being lifted easily out of the back of an Abrams.,WorldofTanks,cous869,1,t5_2s113

This is especially useful for shooting at tanks that go unlit but arent moving. I blindfire killed a Pershing after it went unspotted through the gap in the north bunker on siegfried line earlier in my WT Pz IV by locking the front of the bunker and firing straight through the gap so that the shell didnt attempt to arc through the top of the bunker to reach the ground on the other side behind it.,WorldofTanks,covmdsu,1,t5_2s113

3240193,0,t3_2x66qp,Even without gold the T is still a very very good tank. E is decent enough too.I think gold ammo makes the nd choice guns on some tanks very viable and powerful. The mm on the KV has great accuracy and a very short aimtime which allows you to shoot on the move a lot. However the penetration is quite poor for a tank that cant flank effectively. APCR gives you  pen which is more than enough to take out any tank you meet.There are some other tanks which have the option to chose between better softstats or better penalpha. T with mm M gun or ARL  with mm F are considered very useful setups.Id also like to mention two tds for which I believe premium ammo makes a huge difference in performance not quite god tier thoughARL V and Jagdpanzer IV I played the ARL V with the mm with mostly APCR. With this setup you get more dpm more alpha more  penetration and a better aimtime than with the DCA . The only advantages the mm offers are better accuracy which kind of gets negated by the longer aimtime and a mm APCR  shell which is an overkill in most situations.For the Jagdpanzer IV I chose the cm L over the cm L for better alpha and dpm.  damage per shot just doesnt impress anyone. The cm gets mm pen with APCR which is enough for tier VII and soft tier VIII tanks.,WorldofTanks,coxupsd,3,t5_2s113

3282372,0,t3_2xpmf9,utaugrim does a pretty good job showcasing the tank in this videoBasically you want to use the tanks good penetration and accuracy combined with the excellent top speed to move around the battlefield and engage targets at medium and long ranges. The  penetration means you can engage most targets frontally so flanking isnt usually necessary.  That doesnt mean kemp bush. It means always be looking to keep the high RoF gun ticking over on a target.  The UFP armor and mantlet can bounce low tier guns so stay angled at  degrees at all times. The turret face itself is weak though so avoid static hull down positions. ,WorldofTanks,cp2f17e,2,t5_2s113

While the pen isnt amazing it is accurate and fast aiming so it can hit weak spots quickly and easily if you know where to aim cupolas lower front plates drivers hatches MG ports etc. Although because half the people playing WoT are terrible the tank is seen as a lemon mostly because they cant get the play style to work it took me a long while but I got there in the end.,WorldofTanks,cp2yypa,1,t5_2s113

3292592,0,t1_cp3jdp7,For me the V was a surprisingly stealthy vehicle with a full camo crew.  That didnt mean it wasnt horrible oh no trust me it was not fun but it wasnt quite bad enough for me to throw my hands up and give up on the line.  The traverse angle is so small that a Churchill moving sideways would have you cursing as you keep adjusting your hull angle.  The armor is garbage and you dont have any speed as of yet.  However... your gun is really amazing.  You take all of your frustrations with the tank stuff it in your shell and blast enemies away.  As a longrange support sniper this tank can deal a lot of damage while staying unspotted even if you have to traverse the hull.  It takes a while to figure out how to work with this tank but once you do its not all that bad.  Also although the top gun is hard to use on this tank some people will use it.  I dont like the added aim time though so its up to you.  You need to unlock it for the next tank anyway.  Oh and I nearly forgot... the V is  unusable at stock your only gun option is a tier  derp gun.  You MUST have enough free exp and silver to research the suspension so you can at least scratch the paint on the vehiecles youll be facing.  NOTHING can be mounted on the V until you research the suspension.The tank that comes after the V the AC I thought was much worse.  You lose any sembalance of camo you had as a V.  You move faster and fire a bigger gun but youre also  tier higher now.  Your armor is really only useful against tanks below your tier.  Anything your tier and higher could probably just go straight through the front.  Not that they need to because the cancerous tumor on top of your V multiplied into  gigantic lumps right on top of your tank.  You also have an extremely tall profile reason why you dont have camo.  So now youre not quite fast enough to play like a medium that comes at tier  but youre no longer stealthy enough to make a good sniper... so... ya... there isnt really anywhere to put this tank other than direct fire support or edgeofviewrange sniper.  The best thing you can do in this tank is support till midgame then use your speed to hopefully find a hole in the enemy defense and surprise them.  But then arty will splat you because of course this tank has a gigantic topdown profile.  On the bright side after that wtfery that the V stock suspension was from here on out you never need the suspension to fully equip the tank with items and modules.  Stock suspension for the AC AC and Foch can all carry a fully specced vehicle.  I nearly quit at the AC but Im glad I kept going since the  and Foch are great tanks.,WorldofTanks,cp3kyx7,2,t5_2s113

If you have speed and youre in a platoon focus on one of the Es ram them park in front do whatever it takes to minimize their field of fire or to block their shots. Especially if theres two of you in mediums you should be able to take them out one by one. Being aggressive can really make a difference. Youre surprising the enemy youre showing your strongest armor you can focus on one single enemy and youre in a position to use your speed and weight. Make sure to use hitpoints in the markers know how much damage your shells do on average and calculate the damage you can do by ramming with your vehicle at a certain speed. In my SU I will often go full speed against enemies that I can not kill with  certainty with one shot but Ill fire at them close range and if they need a final push Ill ram them otherwise Ill use them for cover.

3330147,0,t3_2yavs2,The short answer is yes.    The long answer is it depends on the map your relative guns the opponents armor the other guys relative skill to you and how well you can function in a different spot.     If its a prime sniping spot it should go to the tank that can do the most damage in it. That means DPM accuracy and penetrationand the enemies armor has to be accounted for.    If you are a tier  in a tier  match I would normally give up a good spot to a higher tier tank if I think his stats are good enough that he wont waste it. Their DPM is usually higher and they have the pen to reliably pen every shot which depending on the enemy armor might not be the case for you.    Getting the most out of the match includes helping your team. While you shouldnt rely on pubs too much you should avoid actively hurting your teammates and this includes taking spots that are better filled by other tanks. I dont know if that is the case here as I dont have time to watch the replay. ,WorldofTanks,cp7v3md,8,t5_2s113

The global map rating appears to be based on raw number of provinces held or possibly gold income of the provinces held rather than who the clan is actually fighting.. unless FAMEs utter dominance of the UK is more contested than it looks to be.The list sorted by Global Map Rating is different enough from the Clan Rating that the two are clearly not strongly correlated  HDU being a prime example  th in clan rating nd in global map rating.I suppose it depends on what you want to measure. If you want to measure clanwar success the wargaming global map rating appears to be a fairly solid measure of global mapgoldfarm potential.. but neither number appears to measure competence in a battle sense directly.

3402210,0,t3_2z6eg1,If youre just starting out reading the Battle Mechanics is a must IMHO.  I know its a wall of text. But if youre serious about wanting to improve the first thing youll need to know is how this game works the mechanics behind it.  Especially Visibility Aiming Penetration Damage amp later Matchmaking mechanics are very important.  Add to that a program like Tank Inspector for learning strengths amp weaknesses of the tanks you and your enemies will be driving.Knowing this should make you an average player. But after the mechanics comes experience. The ability to read the game knowing which enemy tank is likely to pop up where which flank will have trouble where is arty what is the enemy team composition ...  This will only come from experience watching unicum streamers is also a good way to learn.  People like Quickbaby and especially Zeven rarely make mistakes and if they do they usually explain them giving you the opportunity to learn from their mistakes as well.  Welcome to WoT gl amp hf.  EDIT Also light and French tanks are harder to play since they require better awareness and positioning because they mostly lack armor.  You should try starting with the Russian heavy lineKV or American heavy lineT heavy both of those are good tanks which will teach you the basics of angling. Their armor and slower speed will also help you survive a little longer by bouncing shells and making you unable to rush into the battle to fast and getting yourself killed.,WorldofTanks,cpg2ssu,6,t5_2s113

Vents to me still seem like the better option due to overall less exposure and the difference between aim time with GLD and with Vents seems very minor at best.  I guess technically speaking it works out this way to me although I can likely and probably am wrong. max bloom  . min bloom  . aim reduction  a total of . faster aim time whereas GLD will result in a . faster aim time so long as one of the four parts is still.  However whenever the case is not true for GLD vents provides you a . boost to aim time.  And this could be completely wrong on my part but isnt the whole reason why Vert Stab is gt GLD because of the permanent reduced bloom?  With vents giving  of GLDs bonus as reduced bloom why would you want to use GLD over vents in most situations?My only testing in the matter is very limited and with no hard numbers but with my t I tried both options for a small number of games think  per equip and vents just felt like a much better option to me.  That said part of the reason being that the t felt significantly more nimble with vents over GLD and the different in gun handling was barely noticeable  slightly faster to get fully bloomed shots however snap shots and nonfully aimed shots seemed to hit my target area much more frequent.,WorldofTanks,cpql0h5,1,t5_2s113

But in the context of the game an autoloader is the selection of guns that fire single rounds at greatly increased rates followed by their lengthy reload period. As opposed to autocannons which fire anywhere from  to  shells usually just large bullets have a limited range of about m and retain the lengthy reload period.EDIT  I do think the phrasing should probably be changed from autoloader to automatic loaderautomatic loading system because most people will think autoloader means an IS with xmm shells with s intradrum load times or something like that.,WorldofTanks,cptj02z,2,t5_2s113

Ive also heard that pros will purposely try to intersect their gun barrel with yours during a brawl to absorb your shell so the hit box definitely extends down the barrel.  In fact... I remember a while ago when the T was released for the first time Jingles or QuickyBaby put up a video where a T tried to derp someone but their shell hit the gun barrel and detonated so the tank only took minimal splash damage.As for why you cant reliably knock it out.... Im not sure whether the gun qualifies as an internal module and is subject to the saving throw rules or not.  If its subject to saving throws thats your answer.  Otherwise its something else.I have no idea how much HP a gun has.editIf you believe the wiki the gun has only a  chance of taking damage from a hit  So youre seeing saving throws in action.,WorldofTanks,cpz94zm,4,t5_2s113

3572973,0,t3_3182yk,One big consideration and while I dont have the full data to support this I am confident in my point.People who tend to spend significant amounts of money in this game such as tier eight premiums will generally be players who play a lot and likely are slightly better than your average player. Remember average win rate is roughly . So most players who buy premiums are looking for crew trainers or money makers for their higher tier tanks. Your average play for fun type player wont be as focused on those things.Im a unicum recent and own a lot of premiums because I minmax some and like the variety of them. People who play much more casually arent as concerned with those higher tier or CW play so arent going to invest as much or choose to spend so much.So yes premium win rates might be higher but that is not a damning piece of evidence for your claim. Not all players have them so the user base is skewed dramatically. There will I am confident be a higher percentage of good players driving premium tanks. Therefore their skill differential will increase those tanks win rate above the average. But that selection bias because more good players buy the premiums than others. ,WorldofTanks,cpzjoxs,9,t5_2s113

Check out the tank lineup at the beginning of the game.  Figure out whether youre the only one or one of only a few on a flank.  Just becoming more aware of whats going on around you will help without any specific knowledge at all.WoT Wiki is the place I started.Tank Inspector will help you with armor layouts sorry no link for this...WoTLabs Articles is another great resource.But real talk here.  In about  of cases maybe more you only need to know the stuff from PhanthomPhreaks link for Battle Mechanics and you can apply those rules broadly.Theres also lots of common weakspots with exceptions of course but those are the tanks you look up to shoot like cupolas lower plates obvious holes in the hull for viewMG ports a patch of flat armor amid sloped armor etc.I avoided information overload when I was starting out by concentrating on just the tank I was playing and a handful of notable enemy tanks that I had a hard time dealing with curse you KV!.

3682909,0,t3_32jvx1,Great writeup the Obj.  is such an amazing tank one of my all time favorites. I do however disagree in two points.First I would argue that going down the Obj line is the far better choice partly because you get access to another T tank partly because the Obj itself is relevant in T StrongholdsCampaigns and partly because the line just has the better tanks tier for tier than the T line. Yes the playstyle of the Obj and arguably the AA is different from a traditional medium but that should make it just so much more interesting to discuss in this setting.Secondly I would pick Repairs over Camouflage on nearly every T tank especially for most mediums. Sure the Obj does have decent camo values I have repeatedly wondered How am I not spotted for this? even without Camouflage but not having Repairs feels like such a big deal. Without repairs you essentially can only get tracked once because  after you spend your repair kit every tank with more RPM than an artillery can permatrack you.

3854342,0,t1_cqvf49g,I would still say that the ability to bounce lower tier tanks has some use to it even if the T cant reliably bounce Tier  and s anymore. Certainly the AMX  Pt wont bounce anything except off the gun and then youre lucky if it doesnt break your gun.I do agree that the  Pt gives you more to work with overall but I would say that the T is probably the more average to mid tier player friendly tank having decent enough speed and maneuverability and the potential to bounce a round or two when its top tier. The AMX  Pt may give you more to work with but one of those things is definitely the ability to make far more punishing mistakes due to the complete lack of armor and high speed relative to your allies.As for the Leo PTA Im not sure if its that much worse or not but it certainly is at least slightly worse than the  Pt just going by raw stats though the Tier  versions more or less swap in that respect.,WorldofTanks,cqvmpmf,1,t5_2s113

3883130,0,t3_34wudz,In random IS is masterrace when it comes to heavy heavy tanks because it mixes good all round armor with almost inpenetrable upper frontal armor on a fairly agile platform. The gun is not great but workable.The E is still the better tank when able to sidescrape in the hands of a capable player. Why only in the hands of a capable player? Well the E is VERY easily penned frontally through the turret. So you need to wiggle your turret between shots and never look at the enemy. You high alpha and hit points allow you to trade look at him to fire at him only he will fire too but if you can pen him you come out ahead but this is not easy. The E is also easily penned from the sides. So if you suck up you are worse off in the E than in the IS.The Maus is simply not a great tank. Its armor is overall nice but it has the same turret weakspot than the E but NOT enough alpha to trade favorably. Its also slow. If you get to the VKB stop there this tank is great but will be replaced by Maus Proto somewhen and tier for tier MUCH better than the Maus.Finally the IS. Its a heavy medium heavier than the other heavy medium the TE in the way that it has a just a bit better armor no obvious turret weakspot but is less agile and the gun even while decent is simply worse. With the IS too the tier  STI is much better.So the IS is the obvious way to go if you want to go to tier X.,WorldofTanks,cqywry1,1,t5_2s113

4056657,0,t3_370nkj,The turret is a must. The only armor that the Cent  has is in the turret mm on your UFP isnt going to save you from much and the stock turret has wallpaper armor on the left. Remember youre going to get into T and T battles quite often. The lber is good for sametier fighting and sniping at weak spots. However the entire Centurion Line lacks any sort of straightline speed so fast flanking is tricky limits its effectiveness. When I played minegot the  during the NA OnTrack first tier  I freexped the track and turret. I was grinding the Caernarvon at the same time so I had the lber already unlocked. The Cent  and  excel at ridgeline fighting and sniping. You want the most out of each shot.

4109237,0,t1_croo3n9,Okay. So youre in a Tiger  on Siegried Line neutral cap. You start driving as the match begins but a light tank yolos over and youre spotted moving into town. An artillery player who has to do nothing other than aim his topdown view gun clicks on your engine deck and you are out of the game. You did nothing wrong in your Tiger other than have a slow as fuck tank with a huge engine deck but youre out of the game or crippled entirely. This is a good mechanic in what way?This actually happened to me in a game. It is not something that is situational and its happened to me in several slow tanks on maps where being artillery safe and also playing the game in a meaningful way is not possible. Sometimes the arty will miss sometimes it will completely obliterate my healthpool and make me easy pickings for other tanks.Why is that good? In what way do you think that is a positive aspect of World of Tanks?Artillery simply do TOO MUCH damage for how little actual gameplay is required to play them. There is no warning there is no positional predetermination that you can use to counter their attacks. You just have to HOPE theyre not clicking you if youre not in a city. Its horrible. Its not fun. Its almost caused me to quit the game several times and these are guys playing with one hand on their mouse. Maybe they move between shots.Okay so theyre vulnerable when theyre caught out by lights.

4342057,0,t1_csevkwu,The BP is notably better than the Churchills because of its turret. That turret is seriously made of some British stalinium its more than capable of bouncing same tier heavies even on the turrets edges and the mantlets armour is so weird that it can eat APCR because RNGesus willed them into the coax MG or something.The damage per shot is still pretty low but you can turtle down pretty well if you hide the hull. The hull is still designed with the side hull inside the tracks but the sides are durable enough to resist mm pen from a Tiger or T at a  degree angle and the tracks cover a lot of the side hull behind them the only viable shots are into the track guards above the tracks or into the mudflaps hoping to pen through the tracks and into the side hull inside the tracks. Imagine the edge of the picture to be a wall It still goes really slow but turns shockingly well for such a slow plodding tank and it has that anemic gun.

Then theres things like this  gtYou take the hit lose the health  What a terrible idea.  Unless of course you have a lot of armour in which case sometimes you might like to tank all the shots yourself in order to keep the rest of your team safe.  gtWhat counter play is there?  For a slow heavy?  Off the top of my head You can bait shots to waste the SPG drivers time.  You can progress your brawl quickly to minimise the time you spend in common firing zones and force artillery to relocate.  If you have a keen sense of timing then you can just hang out and let them shoot at you and dodge every single one.  Heck you can even take the boring option and stay behind your rock looking dangerous and buying time for your mediums to win the other side of the map.  And thats not even mentioning all the artysafe fighting ground WG have built into every map.  gtYou dont know where he is preaimed. He could choose a random bush or pick the corner that you have to fight on. Its all luck at that point. There is no one position on the map where one is guaranteed to be preaimed.  Its not all luck.  Its all probability.  Artillery are going to target the places that are most likely to have results.  You should know where those places are so you can avoid them or use them as necessary.  gtWargaming says the point of arty is to stop camping but the current mechanic encourages you to find cover that will protect you from arty and thus not take up better positions that would help the team more but are open.  Which comes right back to what I said at the start people camp against arty because theyre scared and theyre scared because they dont know the counterplay.  ,WorldofTanks,csl3xpe,-5,t5_2s113

As for the damages access to paid for tanks premium time etc.... The EULA may claim all day long that we font have rights but as has been affirmed elsewhere in this thread EULAs are currently held in a legal gray area. As to the last bit about actually bottlingmacroing I was always talking about those who claimed that they had done nothing to violate the rules. If you had done nothing wrong and were facing a day ban as well as a threat of a perma ban wouldnt you want to have that repealed and be cleared? I know I would.

It also isnt even sold anymore.The Obj  isnt a premium you can buy at the store. The premiums that can be won in CWs are distinctly different from the premiums they offer in store. EI Much more powerful and useable M VK . K etc...The Cromwell B is the new breed of Premium tank as they are now relinquishing prem MM and making the premium tank more playable. And really these tanks are almost exactly the same. The B gets terrian resistance buff and faster traverse. One of the only exceptions really where they actually IMPROVED upon the regular tank.Since there is absolutely no point to arguing mobility in the DM vs Nashorn...

It would basically mean that a player can perform at his level constantly or close to without having teams that are either too good or too bad.Maybe maybe not. It would mainly change the game dramatically from probably increasing queue times by a lot potentially to completely changing the meta.gt There is also the mm that affects carrying potential theres a huge difference between being bottom or top tiers.Again on average you are top tier about as often as you are bottom tier keep in mind LTs having MM so this has no effect.gt I am the constant but in some tanks I get rougher matchups.How many games have you played in the M so far? Similar doesnt mean equal. You are also now playing through the M AFTER you played the  for  games probably increasing your performance in similar tanks.

Perhaps I wasnt too clear.My point was in terms of wn its more or less equivalent since the damage required for a given level is homogenized through a population and only restrained by the players themselves.In absolute terms X damage  end of story no doubt that the higher you go more damage you get.In missions when they ask you to do  of enemy teams HP pool this is probably easier at lower tiers  of k is just  however if they ask you for  damage in a game a t or  match probably doesnt even have that much hp.So in absolute yeah the higher you go the more you get and easier it is to get.

I keep maybe  rounds in my Type  and a clip in my t and I fire them when I need to. What I gather from this is you either want gold to only be accessible to people that pay real money making the game very paytowin or have it removed entirely which Im not per se against.

You can limit your exposure better and three hits means you made a decent contribution for that game. It is also hilarious to blam tier s in the face. Hey didnt I have  hp a second ago?

4848224,0,t3_3ha69b,Something you need to keep in mind when you bring certain tank setups like your kitchen sink composition is that the speed difference between the various tanks needs to be compensated for. Imagine two teams one with  cromwells and the other with  cromwells and two rudys. Facing each other on an open field all things equal the team with the  rudys is going to win. Not only are they a tank up they have alpha advantage etc. Now imagine the teams start on different sides of the map and theres a big hill in the middle. Cromwells are faster than rudys so it would be a  vs  at the top if the teams ran at each other straight away. The in total disadvantaged team would win the engagement while the rudys struggle up the hill. With this in mind an all heavy team can do well exceptionally so in strongholds as long as they are able to dictate the engagement. Same with a half heavy half Cromwell team which is going to have a hp and alpha advantage over an all Cromwell team as long as they stay together and allow all guns to come into play That being said cromwells and lights are not only flexible with good view range and dpm offsetting their bad trading potential they also allow for competent commanders to create local superiority using their speed to catch isolated targets. In the this sense the commander must play his team composition to the strengths of the weakest link. In your case the two slow heavies together with several much faster tanks. Naturally you need to be more defensive and try to predict where the enemy will try to isolate you. You cannot leave the heavies behind where he cannot bring their guns into play. It is of utmost importance that your tanks are able to support each other. The heavies would need to be the first tanks to enter battle in this case with the rest of the team following behind. In my opinion there are very few truly bad tanks. Some tanks just make playing and commanding easier such as an all Cromwell team. Instead it is more the tactics that need improving. TldrIm pretty sure that while your team comp isnt necessarily the reason you are losing getting an all Cromwell or light team would improve your chances simply because its easier to play to a good level and back each other up. ,WorldofTanks,cu5nkya,7,t5_2s113

Worst that happens is that they soak up some bullets.    Ive had a team of  bts all try to trap my M because they thought I was some asshole from another match I wasnt and instead of shooting them I broke out and sprinted towards the enemies line they chased and it made them engage. The enemy team killed me and most of them and they later apologized on chat for the mistake and it was ok so I died early in an M on one stupid match and they all died trying to be jerks no big loss.

Not the best way to nurture loyalty in your playerbase.Finally this new policy will discourage people from buying premium tanks altogether because it creates insecurity  hey what if they make it a reward for next ontrack?

Im very aware that HEAT is eaten by spaced armour I never argued that it didnt I was questioning why the OP mentioned HEAT against spaced armour when the IS has no spaced armour. You argued that he meant sloped side armour when he said spaced but from my quote its clear he didnt  You then went on to mention HEAT pen drop off for no reason. Now youre talking about HEAT vs extreme angling for some reason. You seem to be confused with what this thread is about. Just to clear up any confusion I know HEAT has no pen drop off over distance I know HEAT has no normalisation against angled armour Im aware HEAT struggles to pen spaced armour including tracks Im aware the IS has no spaced armour on its sides.Im not sure what else I can say because any point I make you seem to respond with something completely irrelevant accusing me of saying something I simply didnt,WorldofTanks,cuxczu9,3,t5_2s113

The top speed is labelled  kmh in reverse  but with these movement values Power to Weight. hpt Terrain Resistance     hard.......       medium .       soft........However it does have that huge damage.

Unlock more tanks of similar battle rating before you put them in your lineup. You are not forced to use a new tank just because you unlocked it. You might be thinking of that other tank game that forces you to switch tanks every time you want to progress.That being said theres not a single WT player that wouldnt admit the way Battle Ratings are calculated is utter shit or that the game isnt riddled with problems because the devs are morons.Then again theres a lot of people that didnt grasp the concept of BRs at all then complained that the game was unfair.

It is the Hey look at us new toys! New Game! sale. WoT was released all the way back in  in the RU. It didnt come to NA until . A lot of players like me had no idea about it until . It has won multiple awards starting in  and ending in . It is still ranked highly by many in the gaming media locales. I can log in at any point on an NA server and have k players to play with and against. God knows what its like over seas where the game originated. Would you even remember what the opening deals were back in  while the game was being released on RU EU CHN NA all the way to  with Singapore Korea and Vietnam? How about  and  with console versions? Playstation gets it next year... So this old and tired game continually garners a broader fan base but its tired and old and in your words have never had a sale quite like AWs opening weekend? Console had some great deals when it started. Console continues to get good to great deals. Im newer to the game. But Im sure there are guys that post here that started in  who can chime in on NA PC deals or EU PC deals or even perhaps RU. Keep in mind I mean for WHEN the game opened.The biggest thing AW has going for it... Is World of Tanks created the baseline for everything that makes a SUCCESSFUL tank game. They are the PIONEERS of this. Is AW that spectacular in your mind? Because it seems to me a lot of the mechanics and a lot of the play styles are quite similar. But what do I know... I still play my tired old tank game that is STILL fun to this date. That lets me play even on my SHIT computer without issues Minimal Graphics? Fine by me!. You go ahead and play around in your new game with your biased views. But keep your shit out of our World of Tanks area. Well go over to Armoured Warfare if we are interested.

5747536,0,t1_cx9carb,Ill give it a shot although Im not  clear on some of the points myself.What is clear for me is that WG is using an exponential weighted moving average EWMA to calculate your tanks average damage.  Theres a couple reasons why this is a good thing As new data is received old data exponentially decays in relevance. Damage data doesnt need to be stored to calculate an average like you would have to do for a traditional arithmetic mean.  All of the past damage data is stored in the average. WG has the flexibility to change their chosen weight ratio in the future to either emphasize or deemphasize recent results.So how the EWMA will work according to the equation in that post is like thisStart with Dold  .WGs chosen weight ratio is  but Ill simplify to . just for an example.Lets say your latest games combined damage total is .Dnew  .   Dold   .    Dnew  The next time you play a game Dnew becomes Dold in the equation.  Notice that for the first iteration your  damage game really didnt have much of an effect on the average.  This is because under WGs weight ratio your most recent games only count for  of the average while the initial Dold of  counts for .  However as you play a few hundred games the overall weight of the initial Dold exponentially decays.  After  games the initial value of Dold only accounts for . of the average ..  This way your oldest games have less and less of an effect on your average and any single goodbad game doesnt radically sway your average more than it should.  You can also see why its really hard to gain MoEs when you dont have too many games on a tank.  The initial Dold of  screws you over for a while.Now for the part that wasnt  clear to me the calculation for your  of the population.  The graph on the post has  lines.  For now just focus on the red line.  According to the OP the red line represents for the E the relationship between Dcurrent as calculated by the EWMA equation and your population .  According to WG the first mark comes when youre gt the second mark comes when youre gt and the last mark comes when youre gt.  You can see that as your Dcurrent moves up you get assigned  points based on the red line and to get  MoE on the E Dcurrent has to be .The part where I get lost is the black line.  The OP is trying to figure out where Wargaming gathered the statistics to say lets make  damage equal to top  of the population.  According to him he gathered damage statistics from single replays assumably for the E and graphed it along with the EWMAWG  graph.... but Im not clear how he converted single game damage into EWMA and calculated the WG  for it.editMore info about EWMA if you want it,WorldofTanks,cx9jdhs,2,t5_2s113

First of all the Missiles are flying almost as fast as the speed of sound gt you hear the sound only milliseconds earlier than the projectile. Look at those people not hearing a single sound before getting hit by a TOW missileAnd the second thing is showcased in your posted video You hear a single thud followed by the first audible sound  seconds later and the impact  seonds after the sound. That missile traveled possibly km in that timeframe. I think you all dont realise that this isnt a loud roaring tractor you can hear  km away when it starts its engine. It is a missile that flies  meters behind the soundwaves it produces. The russian K Refleks is even faster than the speed of sound.My bet is that the commander saw the dust the launch caused km away and got the fuck out of the tank.You can see yourself in the source video .

But what it lacks in pen it makes up for in speed and when it does pen it does ALOT of damage.  You must travel in at least pairs to be really effective with this tank as the reload is up around  seconds.  I dont platoon often but I will pair up with a heavy and just cover his flanks.  I have not had an issue with accuracy my long shots are just as good with this as others except my E and EM.  I really enjoy this tank especially with the added  degrees of depression.

The Waffle on the other hand was literally completely invented by Wargaming. They took the Es hull and threw a gun on top that never actually got an autoloader variant and then created a gun shield for it entirely from scratch. The WT E is the single most unhistorical vehicle in this game currently by a mile.Also if you care to take a look on the official forums I know I dont often you can find plenty of complaints about the unhistorical aspects already in the game so yes there is a significant portion of the playerbase that cares more about this stuff than about every part of the vehicle being used as a balance parameter.

But i mean its not like you have much choice about whether to grind the AMX  or not if you plan to get an ELC or   or Batchat.  Would love to see when you are bottom tier do A when you face a Matilda try B when you face a KV try C when you face a tier  tank with low pen bully like youre a heavy tank etc..  I also like reading about the upgrade path and tactics you can use with the stock guntank.

This little beauty has enough armour and HP not to die from single shot so you dont have to play as cowardly as in other SPGs. It is slow and the range is short but with the gun arc you can shoot at enemy behind obstacles that would be safe from other arties  the reload time is amazing and allows you to constantly pound on enemy tanks untill you accumulate enough damage to waste them.You should take your time to learn where you can go at the start of the battle to be the most useful for your team and learn where to aim at in order to hit the weakest armour.,WorldofTanks,cynuz2e,1,t5_2s113

6170391,0,t3_402tt9,. Tracking  Instant track repair is the result of a fastfingered wizard. Many players driving LTs or other squishy tanks have already decided that any tracking shot is pretty much a must repair and set their small repair kit to the nd slot. This means that they can reflexively hit  very quickly to repair their tracks close to instantaneously.  A maxed out repair setup will take... . seconds I think? Source is probably . Whether you use premium consumables depends on your credit situation and how many premium consumables  you can stockpile on sale. Personally I usually only use Auto Fire Extinguisher in random battles and small everything else you rarely need to use an extinguisher so the credit hit isnt too bad.  I am more likely to use premium consumables on higher tier vehicles.  I am also more likely to use large kits on heavy tanks than LTs because heavies can soak up more punishment and end up having multiple damaged modules..

6278090,0,t1_cz36evn,We seem to have very different definitions of skill cap. This game actually has a much higher skill cap because there are just a lot more variables in this game than in the two you mentioned. Thus a great player can win  of their random games even though they are only theoretically  of the variables for the outcome.

This happens a lot in my M.  So I guess I was just saying you are splitting hairs by saying that HE doesnt really do more module damage than AP.  In reality HE does more module damage.  I understand the math part and the game mechanics but with everyone here it just makes sense to give a yes to a question of whether HE does more module damage because given all your explanation above it still does more module damage than AP.

6467368,0,t3_447s8m,When I began WOT  years ago I tried the British line first and it almost killed the game for me. No one warned me that the Brits are a tough line to begin with they are mostly slow lightly armoured with low damage guns. Same thing happened with the Lights I went up as far as the German Leopard but didnt understand spotting or camo and was always bottom tier in a deflated depression I sold it and never went back to it. I did keep the PZ C and the Luchs as they are fun tanks. There should be a warning when you download and install WOT. While youre waiting for it to install it should say New Players must begin with the Russian line and advance through either the Heavy or TD branches. It would save a lot of player loss due to a crappy initial experience. Im a weekend solo pub player trying to hang on to a  WR and it took me   years before I got my first couple tier s. Partly because of the cost of playing them and also because there are a higher percentage of good players up there. Take your time its not a race. Patience is a huge part of the game so many players rush off and die in the first couple of minutes. Delay your start and watch where the team goes see how they position and whos doing what. Learn your role in a game is anyone spotting no then now youre a spotter. Is any one backing up the slow TD when he gets attacked by  mediums then be that guys back up. Are  players on your team rushing one side? Well somebody has to delay the enemy rushing the weak side. It may be suicidal but if you can hold them off for a few minutes longer the bulk of the team just might cap. At the loading screen see who the strong enemies are what are the tough tanks warn the team in Chat tell them that the enemies top  are a purple platoon and will be playing together. A lot of guys dont use XVM and have no clue who the enemy is. Reading the map and knowing who the tough enemies are and where they are on the map is important.  I assume that you have some mods installed by now. Some are a must and some just make the experience better. If not check one of them out I use Solos but there are others. Good luck and remember its not just a game its much bigger than that its an experience it replaces girlfriends and wives it offers an avenue of escape on bad days and a place to lose a few hours or an entire weekend when life is just too much to face. It will give you an intense adrenalin high when things go well and then  minutes later push you off the cliff of despair when you pull off some bozo attempt to beat the other team to that stupid hill top just one time too many. It is entirely simple or as complex as can be. ,WorldofTanks,czo9sbh,5,t5_2s113

I am on your side in this situation and that is Wargamings fault for making some tanks too much like the historical ones.As for your other scenario  seems a light tank is either being a dick or trying to play TD just like your other scenario.

Too many heavy tanks dont have enough armor or enough pen.  Wargaming has really put the heavy class at a disadvantage with the use of premium rounds.  The Oi experimental has very weak armor so if you cant take one out then you are playing your tank wrong.  Dont sit there and expect to trade shots with one and win.The Oi has exactly the amount of armor that a heavy should  finally wot has a heavy tank that plays like a heavy tank.  Its nice to have a nice big derp for the times you get put in tier  matches which is ridiculous in the first place.Stop bitching because due to the introduction of Jap tanks you can no longer steam roll with your favorite tank.  Change your strategy and you wont get your feelings hurt.There are much worse problems to complain about than one tank making the game harder for you.

6687298,0,t3_4773g2,WoT is a deceptively deep game. Mastery of all game play mechanics takes time research and effort. Understanding the limits of your vehicle is as important as understanding the limits of your enemies vehicles. As you improve you will attain an intimate knowledge of each map each tank and will start playing the game before the battle clock starts.As helpful as written reviews videos and streams can be you may find you hit a plateau emulating the behavior youre observing. Beyond this you can and should play with better players. Join skirmish teams or other teamplay oriented formats these outlets force you to become familiar with certain maps and give you a chance to see the big picture improving your response to minimap information.Experiment outside of your comfort level. Dabble in all classes at every tier. If you derp out and die early find a competent player to observe. Practice early aggression to take and hold an important spot as well as conserving HP for a lategame mopup carry. Practice derping and tactical yolos. Practice camptastic snooze fests. Practice scouting pushing angling and performing all of these functions even if you arent in the right tank...Many games are won when the heavy has the balls to scout for TDs and SPGs or when the light leads his team through a narrow corridor.,WorldofTanks,d0b0wsv,1,t5_2s113

Theyre just waiting for you to walk into their cursor. If I have to be in the open with skycancer Ill fake movement ie start to back for a second then move forward again for a second then back for five then forward etc doing it annoys them and throws off their aim a bit and if theyre just waiting for you to hit the S key to fire you just avoided their shot.

6787944,0,t3_48qjo8, Stats. Overallrecents. Some may disagree with me over the importance of your overall stats but clans definitely look at your recent stats. Personally I consider a  player worse than a  player. A large gap between overallrecent can also indicate statpadding. Tanks. Do you have viable tanks? It could be a dealbreaker for some clans if you dont have a basic battery of vehicles. Individual tank stats. Do you have  WN but have  average DPG in tier X mediums? That doesnt look great. The other reason is that if you suck in a tank like STB which fits a specific niche the caller needs to know so that they get somebody who plays the tanks better to do so. Are you an asshat? If youre an asshat usually people wont let you join a clan because youre an asshat. Are you active? A lot of great CW clans have been bleeding members due to inactivity.

I would caution you against buying any higher tier premiums T or above until you have a couple of tanks of that tier and understand the mechanics that become important at that level  shot placement angling armor using cover etc.Otherwise Church III is a great tank as is the Ram II especially if you have tank crews that can train in them.  Carry some gold in either tank in case you come up against something tough or just understand that there will be games where you will be useless and are guaranteed to die.

Follow your team wait for them or spot them aim fully your target and boom. Full back to cover. Repeat that... You are Tier  HT supporter. In hardcore Tier  match you can play T as HT while in hardcore Tier X you should only snipe as Tier Xs knows to be monstrums.

Instead of your  winrate you would just brag with what league youre in. And no reds would not just turn green they would slowly as they get better be matched up with better players. When theyve arrived a level where they win roughly  of their games wohoo theyre being matched with players of equivalent skill. Guess what happens when they improve? They win more of their games and get ranked up ergo matched with better players again. Thats how you get better in a game with a reasonable matchmaker. Not by elongating your epenis called WN. Name one big free to play game that has been hurt by having skill based MM introduced. People that argue that reds would turn green are just afraid theyd lose their unicum bragging rights. ,WorldofTanks,d23aksj,0,t5_2s113

Timing is so predictable. So many players will peek around a corner immediately after reload. Do this once or twice and I have the timing I need to hit you the next time you peek around the corner. You need to vary the time you wait to peek around or at least do a fake peek and bait me into taking a shot. . Players sitting there looking or waiting for a shot. I take a few seconds to aim in and add in a few seconds of flight time. Take your shot and pull back.I dont know if you do either of those things I have never seen you play.

I only use autoaim to point the gun in the right direction when peacing the crap out so not having to be accurate to click on them is nice.When I was learning I used a mod that showed penetration numbers where I was aiming eg green  meant I had  more pen than their armour. It was great to learn where to shooter but I think that it shouldnt be allowed as a mod.I use xvm just so I know who to be weary of. Proxy spotting a tomato heavy?  chance he suicide charges me so be ready. Am I by far the top player on m team? Expect arty spamming. As much as i hate xvm arty sniping arty in general is the problem here not xvm.I wish that there was a mod to make looking through breakable but see through cover better. Eg some guy is behind a see through fence but exhaust the fence blocks LOS I dont get the red outline whb aiming over him which is quite annoying.Finally I think stuff like tree down should be banned.

7560373,0,t1_d317pyp,I agree that vision is vital to WoT at any tier.  I was intending the comment to be focused on new players perspectives and I admit that intention was unclear in the post.New players cant take advantage of any of the things you mentioned.  Veterans can pay for k credit binoculars and have a crew trained at over  but how is a new player going to do that if their highest tank is tier ?  From a new players perspective theres little they can do to play vision games with the enemy.  No doubt the enemy can play vision games with them but from their perspective theyre learning next to nothing about vision except that theres invisible tanks who can shoot them.Coming to tier  a new player finally has the credit income to afford equipment like binoculars.  Their tanks base view range is higher and they can probably grind out their crews major qualification to .  Its around here that all the stuff you mentioned starts to become relevant for a new player.  Suddenly they can sit in a bush wait for binos to come up spot some enemies reverse behind the bush and fire at them undetected.  Some players who grind a lot may even get th sense at this stage.

He generally stays on topic covers the important stuff and doesnt waste too much time with needless details.I know hes been at this for a while though as Ive seen some of his early work and it was a little rough and less entertaining. Its funny to see him playing public matches on Twitch... especially when he loses his cool and starts yelling at his platoon mates. Its good to know that even the experts can get enraged once in a while.I also agree with MicMan about mediocre players...

There are other situations where forcing a friendly to die will actually be a net gain for the team but theyre all highly situational very rare and the majority of the player base wouldnt be able to recognize them.gt In the example above was the E the better tank for that spot?The E  should have lined up in echelon with the T or the T with the E  either would have been fine.

Unlike the CDC a hull down Mutz has the chance to bounce stuff. Its a super fun tank if you like the noarmor fast medium gameplay.    If you are also interested in crew training the ISa is not as great as the IS because it lacks the th loader crewmember in all other RU heavies.

7867405,0,t3_4n2wyh,World of Tanks chat can often be vile.  One simple mistake can result in a player being jumped on by others for that mistake.  And often times a team can get vile with one of their teammates without understanding what was going on for that player.  World of Tanks has a reporting system but not a compliment system.Tonight I got to see both in what was for me backtoback games in my T.  In both games I had BaronVonCheeto on my team.  In the first match we won an Assault match in which an enemy T wrecked four tanks after we had already essentially won.  The enemy T had hit cap ten seconds too late to cap it out and instead decided to do as much hurt as he could.  BaronVonCheeto was one of the four tanks taken out despite his best effort to put down the T.  Despite his best play in his Foch it wasnt meant to be.  Our KV started insulting him in chat.After the match I ran out some trash in the real world and started up another match in my T.   Low and behold I managed to get another match with Baron.  We fell behind and things didnt look good.  Then as a team we rallied and the game flipped.What makes this game so damn amazing to me was not the game itself.  It was the impact that chat had on me in this particular case.  You see I passive scouted the field in Malinovka initially and two other scouts were active scouting the same area after I had gotten into position.  I didnt get much spotting done and only a shot or three of damage off.  We were starting to fold and I felt like I had failed as a scout for not moving out sooner.  But then the chat started to talk about how much I was pulling us around in the midend game.  Here I was doubting some of my decisions like going to scout south for arties instead of falling back to deal with the Lowe and the in game compliments made me realize Id been making good decisions all along.But the kicker was the post game.  The match was over and I was letting myself recover from the intensity of that match.  Baron sent me that message and a bit more after it.  To take the time even a brief moment to compliment another play goes a very long way.  And this was coming from a play with a much much higher WN that I.  I just wish World of Tanks made it easier.Though not important to the discussion this is the second match in question,WorldofTanks,d40data,17,t5_2s113

8016643,0,t1_d4h3lwv,gt Heavies go certian places to fight other heaviesThis kind of thinking is rather... low level. With any tank you go where you need to in order to have the maximum influence on the game. This is not as simple as heavies go to the heavy zone. Depending on maps and team compositions and what heavy youre in you may or may not want to go elsewhere. Like on steppes encounter the heavy brawl zone is on the other side of the map from the cap zone. If you go there youd better win it fast cause it you lose the other flank its going to take you a while to get over to the cap zone and if youre in a heavy and see all your teams heavies to the prime brawl zone on the west you have to make a call whether to join them and try to win that flank fast or go the other direction and try to hold out the cap circle.Similarly on redshire going east in a heavy can be dubious on encounter because if the enemy secures the middle of the map and tries to cap you out you will find yourself between a rock and a hard place having to either push through or back off from the brawl and then cross quite a bit of open ground in order to reset.  Another thing there is a kind of spectrum of heavies some are heavier ie more gunarmor less mobility than others and if you look at the team composition and you know you are going to be outmatched in terms of heavy tanks then again youll want to consider going somewhere that isnt the heavy brawl zone in order to make your mark on the outcome of the battle. ,WorldofTanks,d4h58jy,2,t5_2s113

8048990,0,t3_4pgoo4,Your armor doesnt make you invulnerable in most heavy tanks even when you are in their optimal position sidescrape hulldownfacehug etc.. What your armor does is extend your HP pool better allowing you to outtrade enemies. The E  for example has a massive slug of HP  and very good alpha damage . When angled correctly the armor can block a lot of incoming fire I think realistically around half of incoming shots my armor efficiency in it is like . but it was my first tier X so thats probably too low. So now you effectively have  HP to trade with enemies. More HP  More Alpha  Happy Heavy Tank.The E  is an extreme example of this but its true for heavy tanks in the general case. Just think of your health as being extended by your armor but still a resource that you need to trade away.Also French heavies are basically medium tanks for the most part.,WorldofTanks,d4ks5t1,6,t5_2s113

In addition those holes on the map are going to make it appear less homogeneous so more people are going to be willing to try to take on the big clans think broken window theory. Because many of the clans that will be taking advantage of this change arent otherwise able to hold land if they were this change wouldnt benefit them a weaker clan now owns the LZ theyre likely to lose it to another smaller clan so there is a constant turnover.

8128392,0,t3_4qkbgq,gt am i just playing it wrong?Yes. Try to hide your lower plate and cupola. You can bounce a few more shots if you angle correctly and keep your turret movingpointing your gun up and putting it so it actually blocks some shots fired at the cupola and overall keeps people a little bit more reluctant to fire at it. Know also that  HEAT will make your turret butter along with a lot of tier  guns. Gold makes it harder to use your armor but if used correctly the E is an extremely hard nut to crack especially when top tier. Gun wise it has nice alpha and the pen isnt terrible plus you have a  APCR round that you can use in tight situations. DPM and gun handling are not favorable so play the peekaboo game and try to make your shots count.Mobility isnt bad for a heavy but still play it like a heavy brawler. Yada yada.

8233097,0,t3_4rneth,Thank you for sharing my video. We Community Contributor Team spoke with Wargaming while at Tankfest this year and they assured us they are taking the matter seriously going forward. From what we discussed they have  possible solutions. . Ban all mods. While drastic they prefaced it by saying they would implament into the base game all the mods they felt were useful to the game before taking this step.. Have a dedicated cheat detection software that scans your mod folders as you play. Apparently this one would be difficult as some European countries have very strict laws on what data can be collected and sent via the internet to their servers. . Have an app store type section built into the launcher that only verified modders can publish apps to after verification by Wargaming.All  solutions were being looked at seriously and apparently they want something in place by the end of the year. We all know how quickly Wargaming moves on stuff like this so well have to see if they stick to their time frame.

I only watch his videos occasionally but I do agree that a lot of the replays he features are from players who carry the match by not being a team player. That makes sense though at least from an entertainment standpoint since this guy supports his team well allowing for much of his team to survive walking away with  kills and a High Caliber doesnt sell as well as this guy kills twelve people by sniping the enemy with gold rounds.All that said I just find it odd people would be up in arms about the channel since his seems to be fairly chill and focus mainly on gameplay instead of shockjock commentary.

Had been away for a month came back and loaded up the KV for lols. Tier  match on Murovanka team fails hard. There was a padder in a T kicking everyones ass on the other flank. He racks up a ton of damage then goes afk as his team closes in to finish me off. I kill them all finish off the arty and cap out in the last minute of the game.It was all the more sweet as I imagined the salty rage from that padder when he came back to his screen and realized I had wiped out his team and won.

The free female crew is really great to instantly have a good crew for a single tank and relatively quickly train the rd and th skill for. Thats really great and it will save you a lot of time training up this one set of crew to have multiple skills.However if you dont really have a need for a really good crew with  skills and you have a few tanks you like that you really want sixth sense for and youre not interested in spending gold to get it quickly I can imagine using a female crew member to get it instantly is not a bad idea. You wont get the most use out of them that way which is why everyone else here will say its a bad idea  but you do indeed save a lot of time skipping the sixth sense grind.

Wheeled scout and fighting vehicles were used to increase range both strategic and tactical decrease maintenance vehicle can drive longer distances before breaking down and significantly they were quieter tracks are noisy as hellBut to get those strengths you had to lose some things that are important in WOT game play like armor gun size ammo capacity etc...and Mud would stop them in their tracksThe true reason is simple most wheeled vehicles were not primarily designed for combat they were designed with self defence while performing their primary duty Communications Recce AntiInfantry or Infantry Support. Generally Wheeled Vehicles would not be fun at all.,WorldofTanks,d6a9uas,1,t5_2s113

8582113,0,t1_d6bxo38,WG took WoT in the wrong direction  mainly focussing on things like graphical fluff and introducing new tanks.Turns out that WoT is not self sufficient int he way WG thought it was. Premium ammunition and the introduction of better and better tier IX and X tanks on top of doing nothing about the random MM that assumes few people play top tier  which is no longer the case broke the game.Now anyone playing tier VII and VIII is basically the official victim for tier IX and X players to stomp over as they see fit with the notable exception of the IS and maybe the ISU but not much else.At high tier medium tanks were by far the best option for any good player. WG changed that a bit by changing the maps to be mostly corridors with no cover for TDs so that heavy tanks WGs anchor class have a role. In turn most maps are boring corridor maps with almost no vision management. Still with so much prem ammo around speed gt armor and thus meds are still king.So now we have borked MM borked maps borked tier balance and borked class balance on top of shitty game mechanics like spotting and artillery...WG then finally long last realized that maybe its design team leadership wasnt up to the task and sacked it installing Slava Makharov and likely some other guys instead. They also brought back the old mapmakers.Now its doing a total game systems overhaul which is EXTREMELY RISKY  and therefore tested on the so called Sandbox server.Here view ranges get reduced and other tank stats get changed in order to give tanks back different roles.For instance the Leopard  which is only goiod at sniping gets even more incredibly accurate gun while tanks like TA which are also good at brawling loose the great accuracy they currently enjoy. Also penetration is nerfed but in turn turret traverse is nerfed too so mediumg can actually flank but now MUST do so in order to pen heavies.Well see what of these changes and how much of them will make it to life server.One thing is for certain thoug WoT NEEDS a new MM as the current one is broken. But for this all tanks need to have the same MM  so WG first must introduce tier IX and X Light tanks and also likely remove limited MM tanks.So quite a lot of work.,WorldofTanks,d6eclkm,3,t5_2s113

8590446,0,t1_d6fasfq,gt Side note Im a bit dissapointed that a lot of the Russian TDs have specialized TD versions of heavy tank guns. The ISU has access to the mm BLS which isnt a substitute for the regular BL Happens with German heavies and tank destroyers as well. Its at its most obnoxious with the short  cm guns. The PzSfl IVc uses the  cm Flak  L the VK . P uses the  cm Kw.K.  L and the Jagdpanzer IV uses the  cm Pak L. All have the same pen and damage all have to be researched separately.By the way why cant the  mm S on the IS use the same rounds as the  mm SA on the Object ? Practically the same gun but the SA has  mm more pen and  more damage. What is it about the UBRM that makes it so much more powerful than the UBR and also incompatible with the S?Yes yes I know its gameplay balance.,WorldofTanks,d6fe8um,2,t5_2s113

8614644,0,t3_4xsn3a,If you look at tanksgg  you will see they are very similar and if you are wanting a flanker what is more important are turret traverse and tank traverse which are both very limited with that mutz. However the mutz does have good armor and so it lends itself to mid range better than long range so it can support well closer. So IMO the better choices to look at would be the STA or T though they both have a lower power to weight ratio they are better brawlers. While the STA has the best gun handling and pen of all of them ATM. Really the black dog is your best bet and you have it so just keep at it with that or else you are most likely going to be disappointed. I didnt mention the KR and perhaps should have as it is good all around. But nothing is going to have the pep without losing the traverse UNLESS you focus crew skills to off road driving clutch braking BIA and then use gas which boosts turret traverse as well and tank traverse and HPT run vents and see if it doesnt feel a bit better for you. For that is what I do when the tank I am grinding is sluggish.  octane if you are really trying to save money but  if you think the trade off is worth it buy it on sale and stock up and it is considerably more feasible. Lightmedium hybrids are my thing and yet CDC while it is pretty good the gun lets me down a bit too much and it certainly cant flank. While right now I am loving the T with the  and the  is better so that is the tank I dream of atm.  alpha on a mobile platform...Either way good luck! ,WorldofTanks,d6iffdn,-1,t5_2s113

8900346,0,t1_d7hmbyr,Nowadays I skip to the tier  of more or less every tree I get  low tier games are cancer with a complete lack of coordination and any sort of decent play. Of course theyre going to be  theyre full of new players and bad players who cant compete at higher tiers but that doesnt change the fact that theyre awful. Regardless I doubt anyone playing low tiers is gonna complain that there arent any experienced players clubbing them so its better for everyone. Even tier  and  games often tier  too seem to be filled with completely clueless players but the quality of play is still substantially higher than the tiers below and the same could be said about terrible players you find at tier  and  too.As for skipping higher tier tanks they have to be pretty abysmal to play for me to skip them but it certainly happens. The Tortoise for example is awful. Its painfully slow it has no armour against any sort of competent opponent who knows they can shoot at the cupola... or roof... or cheeks... or even the gun mantlet with higher pen guns. It has no turret either so dealing with it is as simple as sitting at its side rear or blowing off its track. It has crazy DPM and an accurate gun but you simply cant use it the vast majority of the time because slow turretless TDs are so painfully bad and so easy to deal with that they either just get left behind or bullied most games. I skipped the AT most of the AT the AT and tried playing the Tortoise but was once again disappointed just because the tanks are terrible and I hate the play style so I skipped to the   and enjoy playing it. Its not great because of its inconsistency a lot of the time but it has crazy potential and is like a KV that you just play for fun sometimes and Im fine with that. Same goes for the TE. Had the Hellcat ages ago it was great bought the T painfully average but meh got to the T Prot and knew Id just despise it as its way way too slow has shitty armour against anyone with half a brain and its gun was nothing special so I left it. Fast forward to relatively recently skipped to the T which I bought and loved the grind as it was nowhere near as slow and had a turret and a good gun then I got the E which is also decent.Basically there are tanks that you just know youre going to hate without even playing them and though some people will just grind through it Im kind of sick of doing that. I used to grind out everything I didnt find it too bad etc. but over time I just couldnt be bothered more and more. It started off with just skipping all stock grinds because they werent fun to play then skipping the rare tank if it was especially bad now if something doesnt fit specific criteria Ill skip it instead of wasting my credits just to be disappointed. Im k games into WoT have very few tier s left to get and I want to collect them all. However when it comes to tanks like the Type  Heavy and the entire French TD line theyre so shit theyre just not gonna be fun to play at all. When there are broken as fuck game mechanics like arty in the game which make me ridiculously bitter pretty much every day I like to enjoy every moment in which Im not getting artied to the maximum extent. If Im trying to fight my own tank when playing and its so limiting and just straight up awful I dont find that enjoyable at all. And while Im attempting to grind through the Type  currently gtk through without killing myself I look at the Foch line and theres just not a single good tank in the entire line except for some lower tier ones like the tier  and  which makes me really demotivated to bother playing them.,WorldofTanks,d7hozs8,1,t5_2s113

9064829,0,t3_54efnj,It leaves a bad taste in my mouth to be honest. Because it means more then what is being said by SP.  When WG introduces these non historical tanks and they end up being overpoweredWaffentrger auf E  completely UnderpoweredChallenger Or just made up entirelyT T Prot FVb. It is us the average joe gamers that have to suffer through the broken  tanks in random battles. We are also the ones who have to suffer when they try to balance and rebalance  those broken tanks over and over again. Then you get to suffer one last timeAs someone who liked the tank  as they are removed  from the game or completely reworked into something new. Why because they were unhistorical broken made up or never belonged in that tier from the very beginning.  Waffentrger auf E  T T Awful Panther FV The original Chaffee  KVS T VK  FV Hellcat M Stuart  Did I miss any?So here we have a guySP who is telling us in advance that these tanks are being added with unhistorical values. One in particular is completely messed up. As well several of the tanks are going to be classed wrong which we have already seen  in the past Multiple  Times. People are just like Who cares game balance gt historical accuracy anytime.  What they dont seem to remember is that wargaming will use the fact that a tank is not historically accurate to remove it or rework it. Also that they are always  reworking the Tech Trees and Always looking for tanks to remove   Here  is the producer literally talking about the topic of this thread he even talks about the Swedish tanks and almost seems to mirror some of the things sp said as well as hinted at the Suspension aiming system. I agree with Gwennifer in this thread there are MANY things that can be used to balance a tanks effectiveness. Changing the historic stats of the vehicle is generally not Required.  As Gwennifer put it We do not need to have fake stats to have wellbalanced historically accurate and fun vehicles. So Yes While I do Agree with the Sentiment game balance gt historical accuracy anytime I also dont think one has to be sacrificed for the other. If you take a good look back most of the tanks that were terribly unbalancedgood or bad they were also not historical tanks.

9077724,0,t1_d82yr09,Sadly you are right. You will see tons of tier  matches in your tier s and you stand little to no chance against them. You cant even passive scout because your view range is crap compared to most of the tier s you will encounter. Most all tier s with very few exceptions Mostly TDs are woefully outclassed by all tier s. It is probably the worse tier in the game and I cannot think of the countless thousands of players that just gave the game up at tier . WG really needs to fix tier  MM. As for aiming for weakspots... Pretty futile in most tier s unless you are slinging a lot of premium ammo which if you are new to the game you probably arent because you dont have millions of credits laying around. AdmObir is right. You do learn playing bottom tier but not so much at tier . All I can say is hang in there man. It does get a little better at tier  depending on what line you are playing and a lot better at tier . I know I shouldnt have to be telling your that the game you are playing eventually gets fun again but it does. Fortunately you wont be at tier  for long. ,WorldofTanks,d82zu5b,5,t5_2s113

9095202,0,t3_54tzal,Right off the bat dont expect any meds you get past the  to be as good. Its an obscenely overpowered tank and a definite outlier compared to the rest with the exception of the T which is about on par. Starting on a seemingly negative note I know but still. The good news is I find most other meds much more interesting to play than the Russian meds  sure they stomp the competition both statwise and in game but they can be quite boring to play imo unlike the Patton Cent X  etc.Also when I refer to the Russian meds Im referring to the T and Obj  or potentially the TObj  II in regards to tier  not the T  or the  as theyre different and not nearly as common as the former. Ill try to make a conscious effort to not compare any meds to the Russian ones because like I said theyre outliers in their ability and it really detracts from the strengths of the other meds.Onto the actual question at handM PattonThe Fatton is an excellent tier  med with best in class gun handling  degrees of gun depression and a solid DPM of over  base. This combined with a decent turret and pretty good mobility in close quarters allows it to excel on ridge lines where it can peakaboom the fuck out of anything it wants to but also in brawling situations providing you let heavies take the flak because the armour really isnt too reliable at all namely the cupola and lower plate but even parts of the turret face and upper plate are penetrable for most guns youll see at tier .While its gun soft stats and aim time are excellent its base dispersion is somewhat mediocre certainly not a Leopard  E  M Cent X etc. so it cant snipe nearly as well as them. Not only this but it has the lowest top speed of any tier  med to my knowledge so when it comes to having to haul ass across flanks or push for extra damage in end game clean up situations it can struggle compared to its competition.Overall this tank is a favourite among many better players at the moment due to the somewhat recent buff it received which put it in a really good spot to favour aggressive play.M GrindGood news! Starting at tier  because I dont care for lower tiers and youre at the tier  of each already you have the T. This is a pretty mobile hardhitting med with  degrees of gun depression. Not only this but its low profile so you can be pretty cheeky with camo and dodging shots if it comes to it. The DPM sucks theres no dancing around that fact and the gun hard stats suck too so dont try to snipe or DPM anything. Punch them in the face and fuck off dance around like the speedy bastard you are abuse your gun depression and youll have a very successful time.Next up is the Pershing at tier . Its ok. I know it has some real fans but honestly its nothing too special. DPM is kind of shitty pen is below average but alright at  mobility is below average but has  degrees of gun depression which is nice gun handling is above average but hard stats let it down a bit its turret armour is the only unique thing about it and it can reliably hold up against sub  pen guns most of the time. Apart from that its probably the weakest tank in the line which is good considering its pretty average. As that means next up is the...M Fatton  very similar to the tier . Can shift around close quarters and ridge lines due to the power to weight and traverse speeds but lacks in top speed and terrain resistance capabilities. Its a bit more mobile than the M but also doesnt quite have the armour your turret wont be blocking anything unlike the M which can occasionally. What the M is all about is the fire power. Over  base DPM places this thing way above any of its competition nearly overtaking the Leopard  at tier . Its gun handling is also once again absolutely excellent it can snapshot better than anything else at its tier. Like the M however the base dispersion is lacking but to an even greater extent this time with a base dispersion at m of .. Sniping in this tank is possible but prepare to be let down quite often compared to something like the E s laser beam. Its all about the brawls and ridge work. One thing to note is the pen is pretty damn lacking at tier  with only  AP pen. This means that in combination with the poor base dispersion youre gonna be struggling with more heavily armoured targets. The APCR rounds really save it and the tank is to an extent as good as how much APCR you sling in it. If youre fine with gold have fun. If you have a personal set of honour rules or something you might have a bad time kind of like the T and its HEAT. Sure the AP is workable most of the time but when theres that pesky tier  heavy are you sure you dont wanna punch a  pen HEAT round through their ugly mug? I know I do.Centurion Action XThe Cent X is a pretty good tier  med and is very similar to the aforementioned. Imagine the M that sacrificed gun handling for better base accuracy and you more or less have the Action X. Its a better sniper than the M but still maintains a decent DPM of  unlike the E  M for example allowing you to dish out the aggressive punishment you love and need with a bit of armour to keep your health pool looking healthy if the enemy doesnt take their time to aim at your weakspots. The top speed of  is pretty average but puts you at a noticeable advantage over the M if it comes to the long haul and the tank gets  degrees of gun depression which is always welcome laughing at the Russian and Chinese meds or even the E  M frontally with its limited  degrees.The Cent X doesnt have the snapshot potential of the M nor the top speed of the Leopard or AMX  B or the turret armour and DPM of the STB but its more of an all rounder. Jack of all trades master of none and its comfortable to play. Not the greatest certainly not the worst. Honestly the main highlight of the tank is comparing it to the old FVs  kmh top speed. The Prius was pretty painful to drive when you stop accelerating at rds what some others can do.Cent GrindNot so good news! ...yeah. Starting with the Comet youll find an underwhelming tank. While someone like Quickybaby will swear down to the old gods and the new that the Comet is a gift from the heavens and we should all feel blessed for having the opportunity to play it its really quite lame maybe  marking that tier  got to his head a little... Shitposting aside the tank feels kind of sluggish and the gun handling is underwhelming with obviously not armour. It has good DPM and  degrees of gun depression which is where the advantages end. Compared to the Cromwell which was an actually gift from God its extremely underwhelming and a step down which isnt something I particularly want when going up a tier.At tier  you have the Cent I. Yeaah gotta be honest here I free xpd past it. At the time of grinding the line I was playing the Caernarvon which was a let down in itself and the tanks look so similar I didnt really want to uninstall the game right there and then so I skipped it. Fuck me I guess. Anyway what I can talk about is statistics and how they perform when I play against them which is absolutely terribly. They have shitty DPM at  base compared to most other tier  meds which have around .  k and shitty gun handling soft stats with shitty mobility etc. Overall the tank is really meant for sniping with its high pen and high base dispersion values but that kind of play sucks in the current meta especially with how I play and even if there was a camping meta the rest of the tank still sucks enough for the Cent to still be pretty lame. TLDR it sucks.At tier  well. Do I have a rant for you? Heres a link to a comment I made the other day warning Its pretty fucking long. TLDR the tank sucks too much to support the decent  pounder it gets so its somewhat forced to use a mm with awful gun handling and DPM. The Cent  sucks ass its a tank that pubbies like to think is good but is actually at the bottom of tier  meds imo seeing as I like the WZ which is the only other thing you can really put below it. Cent AX is a lot better.Part  because apparently youre not allowed to post a  character long commentEdit Fixed some am spelling,WorldofTanks,d853ipc,40,t5_2s113

You have to balance this with staying unspotted and the fact that some arties have a low shell arc meaning that to shoot at a tank behind an obstruction you have to be very far away and should be played at long distance. Since you have time during reloads to watch the map notify your team if a flank is falling  has been ignored. But please for the love of God dont do the repeated clicking of the map. Anything over three clicks makes all players want to TK you. Mark your targets T button and respond to requests for fire from teammates with an Affirmative or a Have no shot there message Just typing in Negative makes you seem like prick. If you have a shot let your team know your reload time. When you have no shot on a target relocate to where you can get a line on the enemy tank if you can safely do so. Dont be afraid to move and cap. Having an extra tank on cap can earn a win. Join the lemming train if it happens. You are the last person who should be attempting to hold a flank on your own. Prioritize your targets  Yes it is very satisfying to hit a speeding scout and send him to the garage. However you will likely miss and you could have hit the T that is making swiss cheese out of your allies. Should you shoot the fullhealth Maus for  damge on its front plate or the lowhealth autoloader medium that is presenting its side to you? Id recommend taking out the medium. Dont park next to other arties especially ones who are too dumblazy to relocate after shooting. Dont shoot when a friendly is facehugging an enemy tankunless you askare asked and receive permission. It simply is not worth the grief of listening to the complaints when you hitkill a friendly  plus it costs you credits for their repair bills. Wait until the friendly is dead then fire.  Splash targets behind solid objects  Enemy tank is hiding behind solid cover and you have no shot? Shoot HE right next to them and splash them. The T is the king of splash with an . meter splash radius.  Try and avoid shooting at targets on the reverse slopes of hills as they present a much smaller target silhouette for you to hit. Even with no obstructions to hit these targets your shot needs to be basically dead on depending on steepness of slope. If you feel you must shoot at this type of target its generally better to aim close to the ground in front of them as if RNG makes you overshoot youre more likely to actually hit them and a hit slightly in front might still spash them Credit to uknightelite for this one. When someone is pursuing you at high speed FV you can sometimes slam on the brakes press S let them fly by and then shoot them in the ass. Did this to an ELC AMX who was pursuing my FV. Messaged him after I destroyed him Learned that one in Top Gun. When it comes down to just your arty against the rest of the red team try to find yourself a firing lane where you can be behind treesbushes and preaim the likely location that youll spot the enemy tank. This is where your binoculars will help you detect the enemy and fire first. Ideally you want to be more than m from where the enemy tank will pop up. Otherwise youll lose the element of surprise because you auto spot any tank within  meters regardless of cover between you. When it comes down to just you and another arty you need to evaluate the tank type. Is the enemy arty in a clip French BC   and you are not? Hiding and ambushing might be your best option. Are you in a slowass Bishop but with some pretty tough armor? Hide and ambush again. Are you in a fastmoving FV and the enemy arty is in a Bishop that has a crap horizontal gun arc? Go hunting. Going mano a mano against an enemy tank is an adrenalinepumping experience. Try to calm yourself and dont shoot too soon. Ive killed many tanks who tried to fire first missed and have tried to vainly escape while I slowly and purposefully waited until I was fulllyaimed and then turned them into a smoking hulk.  Be aware of the TKing. Some of the WOT players cant get over the fact that WG put arty in WOT and that theyve left it there for five years. So these petulant children will kill arties on their team AKA Team Kill or TK. The most direct method utilized is simply shooting arties. That however entails some risk of turning bluegetting banned by WG. They will utilize some other methods  push you out of coveroff a cliff  Ram you but risk turning blue  Flip you over so you die but the most popular method is  Placing their barrel within your barrel while you are in overhead view and then wait for you to fire. The HE shell will explode likely killing you and since you shot them you have to pay their repair bill and you can possibly get banned due to team damage. Arty griefers  these players will simply block your tank or keep bumping you so you cant aim. They are trying to get you to shoot them. Dont do it. The best thing to do with these guys is to simply wait until they get bored and they go engage the enemy. Then when they are down to  of their HP you can decide if you want to TK them. If you do give them the payback they deserve try to splash them with damage vs hit them directly as it is of less penalty towards turning blue. For both TKers and Griefers you should ask both team members to report the douches for unsportsmanlike conduct. Put TKer and Griefers on your blacklist and noone else. At the start of each game you can easily identify them. Note If they change their name they wont show up. If you encounter a player who you have a beef with  know that they are artyTKers move tostay on cap whenever possible. They can still TK you but the penalties for them will be greater. When playing an arty with a turret point your tracks in the direction youll move in the event that enemies get too close. SPGs turn as slow as turtles and youll waste precious seconds turning when you could have been running. You need to vary your strategy depending on the type of arty you are driving. Are you driving a HUGE tank slow moving with a terrible camo value like the GW Tiger P? Did you get Ensk and end up on the field side of the tracks? You are likely better off staying on the field side instead of trying to cross the tracks. Platoon with another arty. This is a incredibly simple yet powerful method for ensuring that there is another player on your team that will have your back. You should coordinate target selection with Teamspeak and trackdestroy target sequentially. Platooning is a proven way to increase your winrate and which will result in a higher WN. In Settings  Sound  Details turn Extra Effects in Sniper Mode to High. This will make artillery tracers as visible as possible.,WorldofTanks,d8h947t,3,t5_2s113

9210260,0,t1_d8jf76z,Not everyone has Windows people like me for example. Its likely that WG found out that their PC and mobile do not share playerbase its possible to use the same WG account for both and avoid social media logins altogether and so since it was already on PC from the Windows  port moving it to Windows  as well made economic sense. Now you dont need to continue to play on your phone if you want to play at home.Dont forget Blitzs system requirements are lowend enough to run on some truly junktier phones. Even on PC the requirements are bottom barrel. Standardimproved render has moved up WoTs minimum requirements over time and Blitz would let people who can no longer play due to the requirements continue to play and give WG money.Also armor angling situational awareness etc all still apply. In fact since its only x and youre virtually always spotted due to the small map sizes its even harder to flank. Plus it seems like faster tanks go slower in Blitz.Finally the impact of different balance is hard to understate. The turret front of the EM was very recently buffed to  mm or similar. This provides a completely different playstyle for the vehicle on Blitz even moreso than the other balance changes could provide. The lack of overhead lets the Blitz team... well blitz the tank balance. Every patch brings major changes to different vehicles. Dont forget that they had the  pen of the short  for months before WoT PC did.,WorldofTanks,d8jgwbq,4,t5_2s113
9216944,0,t1_d8jiwca,From what i can see they were shooting down on the lfp. After angling the lfp is probably a  chance to pen at best.Theyd have been much better shooting at the turret since theyre shooting down at it.

9271640,0,t3_57dcij,Remember there is already a mechanism in place for determining who causes module damage friend or foe. If youve ever been accidentally tracked by an ally your status log shows that they were the ones to track you. On top of that the end of game damage log shows that the game keeps track of what modules you damage on what tanks and whether those are allies or not. It would be very easy to add a little bit of code to save who damaged the module or caused the status condition last and if it was an ally and you fixed it auto extinguishing an allycaused fire repairing an ammo rack damaged by an ally etc to charge them accordingly.I believe that Wargaming is being careful because they dont want to use team damage as a mechanism to exchange credits between players. Factor in that compensation is based on damage done but different alpha shells can have very different costs and its easy to see how a carelessly implemented system could be easily exploited especially in organized play like Clan Wars.That said it would definitely be worthwhile for Wargaming to implement this system. It might take some testing but if they err on the side of caution I think they could easily implement what youve suggested.,WorldofTanks,d8r8ws6,8,t5_2s113

9332499,0,t1_d8ytzwr,If theyd paid more attention to creating the scavenger hunt they wouldnt have needed to make the codes limiteduse. The IP address a browser is connecting from is available to the server they could have created a serverside applet that took a base code specific to the page and hashed it with the browsers IP address to produce a code specific to the IP address the user was connecting from. When they plugged it into the tankrewards site another applet would take the entered code and the users IP address hash the list of stored base codes with the IP address and match them against the entered code. That way in order to use a code someone else had found youd have to spoof their IP address in your connection. The scavenger hunt could run for the full duration of the contest and each person would actually have to do the scavenging themselves.But that requires that you put some actual effort into designing the code discovery and submission process its so much easier just to put a fixed code on the target web pages and slap a counter on each code redemption and limit the number of times a code can be redeemed.

Good because you will be eating a LOT of it because it has crap armor. The gun is only good for brawling and it has a long reload.I make mine work quite well despite the slow everything. Its a beast when its top tier workable against Ts but a complete bookend against T heavies. If you get rushed by anything other than another T in v you will diediedie because of the long reload.

9517069,0,t1_d9ls0qj,I too recently returned after a long time away.  I think the biggest change was patch . last year which nerfed vision mechanics and gun handling.  It greatly changed the meta.

The E can now bounce heat rounds to its cuppola FFS  the E might as well have no turret armor to  pen...The most recent patch was one of the best in recent memory for lots of players  the new sighting mechanics reduce a lot of cheese and a lot of features that used to be in mods damage log hit location indicators are now in vanilla.  Too bad they removed global chat  weve got daily threads bitching about that!Socially speaking NARWL is dead now.  The active reddit clans are RDDT RDDT? RDDT PIR RDDTX and I think RDDTV?

9603669,0,t3_5ci5mu,You picked a bad weekend to come back. All the specials are on so all players bad and good are grinding. Youll be constantly switching between having good teams against tomatoes and bad teams against unicorns. On weekends like this your performance is at the mercy of the match maker so dont give yourself such a hard time. When the amount of players goes down generally the balance evens out a bit more so teams are more equally matched. I would also recommend watching QuickyBaby on YouTube he would give you an idea of how the classes play and what Tank does what role. But as someone has already said playing is the best way to learn. In my opinion roles of Tanks dont really come into play until T anyway so you still have time to learn. As for roles I have outlined the roles of the different classes of tank in my subreddit discussing the roles of medium tanks. Take a look. ,WorldofTanks,d9wukan,3,t5_2s113

If you think about a small cabin type tank the crew all crammed in there.  Half the crew should automatically die making the tanks statistics be shit.These two tanks are designed to be a TD and a TDs purpose is to hide and snipe the enemy.  This often doesnt happen in these two tanks because they drive up in your face and trade shots due to their bouncy armor and rate of fire.They are OP  Wargaming knows it  the rest of the WOT world knows it.  It does get old in a heavy tank to have one drive up and trade shots.  They bounce shots they shouldnt and own everything in their path.

DO NOT try to defend a flank alone it will nearly always end in disaster.Now for an intermediate tip Usually heavies go to heavy area on maps where they can shoot enemies close up... mediums go to medium area wher ethey can keep longer distance to enemies.

Because only in . it is downloaded more than k times.k is nothing to million users and that is k total not k unique which are two completely different numbers. gtYou are talking about  mil players but the active player base is lesser than  mil.Wrong World of tanks across all servers maintains an active player base of  million unique daily.  The Concurrent figures however come close to  million if you only consider one server cluster. Just the Russian servers hit . Million concurrent users by itself I am not sure what the concurrent user total is for all servers combined. gtthese are players that actually play atleast  battlesmonth not botalike individuals who play once in a monthyear for few games.My million is leaving out the bots and  player accounts. If I added those accounts in the number rises to  million. Although Ironically your claim would be better if you did include the bots as all bots are running mods. As the bot program itself is a mod isnt it. gtback on the cheating the site I was talking about above isnt even the most popular one. There are also paid versions the originall WarPack who are used by more than k players every month there are counters you can check so please come again tell me how the minority is cheating and everything is fine in the game.That is total downloads not unique downloads. Every time the game is updated you have to update the modscheats. That means another download. If you run wot on two or three computers that is two or three more downloads every time a patch hits. New version comes out that is another download. Game is crashing because of the modcheat that is another download to get a fresh copy. Reinstalled wot? Download all the mods again.Number of downloads Does not equal number of users.  In fact depending on what is being downloaded it is usually  are actually unique and for wot I would wager more like  due to how many times you have to reinstall mods. Take A skyrim mod for instance on the nexus where they keep track of Unique DLs and Total DLs side by side. SMIM was downloaded  times only  of those were unique downloads. You work out the math and that is about . World of tanks is even worse because every patch or micro patch mods can break so the same users are downloading the same mods over and over and over and over and over and over. The reason I use XVM as the main example is because it is clearly a better metric to judge mod users by. To use xvm you have to link it to your account. Making it very easy to tell how many people are using the stats part of xvm which is right on their website at . million. Most of the mod packs you quoted come with xvm as part of the installation. XVM even pops up to remind you in game to link your account to get the stats and tells you how to do it. Over time most of the features xvm used to uniquely offer have been added to the base game. Which means the main reason to install it is for stats. ,WorldofTanks,daix6m6,2,t5_2s113

You might also want to pick up a good tier VIII LT for missions so you could continue on the AMX  line as the  isnt NEARLY as bad as everyone makes it out to be just hide and spot and take safe shots until things get sparse then go dump mad clips into peoples asses and rack up that damage. ,WorldofTanks,dbqfj48,1,t5_2s113

There are really only  other games which have ever been able to surpass that watermark at any event currently CSGO LoL Dota  Hearthstone major fighting game events like Evo and previously Starcraft and CoD.

10379407,1,t1_dckk63m,Yes the Lefh is broken. But I have Sixth Sense on all the tier  tanks I still have in my garage and I know the arty firing lanes so I can avoid his fire and even if I get hit by a Lefh Ill probably survive a shot because I have over  HP. And even to me the Lefh is an actual gamebreaking tank that vastly limits my options stopping me from doing most of the aggressive things I like to do in this game.Now imagine that you just started this game and you heard that the KV is a good tank for beginners to go for. Youre trying to grind through your T with  viewrange and no camo to speak of you dont know where the arty can hit you and you dont know when you are spotted. Every game you play is tier  or  and the majority of those games have Lefhs in them because youre playing on a server where WG unfortunately gave away a large number of Lefhs over the years thx WG NA. You die randomly for no reason over and over getting under  average experience per game and mostlikely you quit before you ever reach the KV.Thats why the Lefh is really problematic. I can handle getting artyd. Its not going to make me quit the game.

Toons are good though take people who are willing to take a shot from a TD sat in a corner for you to be able to go in and get behind it to farm itkill it Thats pretty much what I did. I did it on Kharkov with a friend in a toon while I was driving the  II. He took the hit from a JGPZ E so I could go in around him and farm the damage and kill. ,WorldofTanks,dcq46uq,3,t5_2s113

EDIT But I have to admit Im surprised that the average is that low I thought the overall player skill was higher than that. I also think that since this is only  games there might be a lot of players still at low tiers where fairly often you get one or two better players on each team who seal club and makes it hard to a learn how to play the game and b do well in that particular match as well as lower tiers generally being harder to play to start with due to low hp pools and high rates of fire so tanks die really quickly. ,WorldofTanks,dcsjg4x,2,t5_2s113

10452011,1,t1_dcskrmy,There are just so many variables to judge that it is not so simple.Is Win the best way to judge good from bad?  If Win is the accepted way to judge how good or bad someone is can it not be gamed by people who understand and are concerned about the stats?If a persons goal is to have a few beers and play tanks but he never cares about stats is he bad at having fun and having a few beers?Is a person that puts money into the game that bypasses bad tanks and always fires premium and uses premium consumables as good as a person with the same stats that grinds every tank never uses premium rounds or premium consumables? What about people who always play in platoons vs those that play solo?Then we have the reroll factor.  Some players that are that into stats may have one or more rerolls which caps the earlier accounts at lower Win while their current account continues to pull in premium stats.  It seems specious to me that people would use a few key stats with limited background to justify themselves.Wargaming should allow people to control their stats and see if that helps the community IMHO.  It is weird to me that some people need this to validate themselves.,WorldofTanks,dcsu3s8,2,t5_2s113

10622691,0,t3_5rxdqw,Go active scouting driving along ridges of Provk for example and then retreat to find a relatively safe spot to hide for  seconds count it if you want and then repeat the active spotting. You just have to assume youre always spotted in these scenarios with the  seconds in cover to make you unspotted so you can poke up again somewhere else without being predictable.If you prefer passive scouting youll only know youre spotted when the tanks that are spotted start turning their turrets at you or have already fired at you. In this case anything unspotted including arty could have already zerod in and aimed for you so youre already at a disadvantage.Its best to actively scout and hide try to not to get killed early or mid game and then rush and flank in the late game to mop up any survivors. If in a loosing game where this is happening to you accept the loss and go for the artillery which are likely undefended by this point and maximise your damage output before you get killed andor do sneaky decap shots to drain as much XP as possible maybe even to get the courageous resistance bonus XP which can balance the loss out with a decent XP count which in turn goes towards your crew.Soon you will have th sense and then you can passively scout more often which can rack up a lot more XP. As for other methods to increase the XP to go towards your crewElite the tank increase crew training by putting all XP into the crewUse any premium tank of that nation and train them up separately incurring a small creditgold cost to retrain.Use a light premium tank of that nation to train them up  no charge on crew retrainingUse x victory XP bonuses XP boosters free XP boosters and crew XP boosters and Premium time to maximise the XP output using the free XP gained to manually increase the commanders th sense skill.A combo of all these can seriously increase crew XP and get you at least a set of  skill crew within a day or two of continuous play with the light crew even faster if you get good matches and victories.,WorldofTanks,ddbnej4,1,t5_2s113

10635488,0,t1_ddcymnb,testcurrentThe change according to tanks.gg is marginal  enough so I dont actually see it as a nerf at all and the cupolas are actually getting more low profile no hitbox model right at the top portion as well as the turret being more squat. The sides of the tank are becoming more V shaped and the turret is still more or less the same with a slightly larger overmatch area. Personally I think it all makes little difference as the playstyle is still the same and the roof is still just as had to pen unless you play it poorly. It remains to be seen how it will translate into actual play on the live server but strictly from the model and experience it will still be the best. ,WorldofTanks,ddcywjp,7,t5_2s113

10800351,0,t3_5ug5xo,Im a green player but i keep a bluepurple performance with autoloaders in general dont ask why i just do well in this things.TLDR to do well on it Early game   Dont try be a hero early game. If you are unsure about have superiority to bully a flank just dont try peak. Dont try bully a t without a shitload of allies in the same flank because everytime they swarm you if you dont have support. Avoid trade or peak in hills because in  of the times some camping TD go hurt you. You need be  sure before peak anywhere in early game to dont lose HP.  Early game use you allies to spot and snipe anything without be spotted if you can avoid close range engagements.  In some maps like for example fisherman bay North spam you can try be agressive in the low middle to spot the heavies crossing. But if you feel the feeling of being spotted dont wait retreat. Some maps have this spots. But after some  seconds relocate to a safe place and support your brawlers punishing anyome trying overcommit.TLDR Dont lose HP and dont lose HP.Midlate game when this happen? This happen when you know where everybody are and some people are dead alreadyIf you are cautious enough in the start you probably have a shitload of HP.Then you start hunt people the priority is murder people without lose HP flank high priority targets and finally start trade HP for any clip. You have the mobility you have the view range you have the gun and you have the HP. Mid game release your hunter mode. The thing is conserve HP early on. You shine in the midlate game if you want a good game in any autoloader you need read the map in the first  minutes.IMPORTANT A lot of times you go have the feeling of be useless and a desire to rush someone. Dont follow this feeling. Wait the game develops. You want be the hunter of the mistakes. Anyone rush a ally need be punished and you need be there. A lot of situations i have  dmg in the first  minutes to a shitload of opportunities start appear. And to use this opportunities you need HP.TLDR of the TLDR Play cautious conserve HP punish people trying overcommit hunt people late game.

Ive lay awake at night sometimes wishing I could change my name to a generic single word with no meaning behind it. Face would be good. It has many layers literally skin and muscle etc but also its the nickname of the titular character from the seminal action series The ATeam . He was as greasy as a snake oil salesmans handshake but gosh darn it he was likeable. A true lothario able to swindle things from anyone and anywhere while dropping panties like it aint no thang. Conversely I could rename myself google and try to sell the account to the actual company in case they fancied a round or two. I mean thats against the rules but its google there is money at stake. I could even play a part and act as a search engine for people in chat on my team. Obviously mostly itd be porn related and may be a distraction but who cares I have a job to do. Like a Gspot or Waldo Brazzers.com wont find itself. Hue.As an aside I do believe the other person who mentioned trademark names is probably correct. Its a bit of a coincidence for every person with a one word name some actual brands to have  games played and zero activity ever right? Is there a Nike nickname with  battles played that just plays lights and never stops going at full speed every game while screaming JUST DO IT EUGGHHHHH in the chat?,WorldofTanks,ddxnd6g,9,t5_2s113

10847887,0,t1_ddyvdnm,I dont think the t is at all op. Im not talking about over powered vs balanced versus underpowered. Just talking about healthy game mechanics. In the current state of the game I just dont think that so much potential for high alpha or devastating crewmodule damage should be on such a mobile platform. If anything the t is weak because of inconsistent performance for the reasons you just explained comparing it to mini bat. But currently with repairs and first aid being one time use like we have and the counter play being so low I think its the right move to remove the derp. Side note about the counter play you mentioned I dont know how to explain why I dont feel that is an adequate amount of counter play. But I will draw the arty parallel again. Saying have better map awareness load he he dies for the damage to me is like saying arty misses most of the shots they take just use positions that are arty safe have better awareness of when arty has fired etc... sure there are counter play options. There always are. But that doesnt make a bad mechanic any better. Also I have had just as many. As experiences in my heavy tanks against a t as I have in my lights or mediums. Its the crew and module damage that to me is most frustrating. Also I would say you are more so vulnerable to these light derps in heavier tanks due to not being able to get away or reposition effectively before being overrun.Its like someone said in another thread earlier about the most op tank being the wt auf e. It wasnt really op just broken. Sure there was counter play to it by attacking it on reload or loading he. But it was broken and so it had to be fixed. OP tanks and broken mechanics are just unrelated in my book. ,WorldofTanks,ddyvt4h,1,t5_2s113
10849261,0,t3_5v378d,I did the same thing as you when I first started and I was awful at the game so it was a massive credit hemorrhage. Over time as I started getting up into tier  with all my lines I started selling off the ones I wasnt playing until I could afford the tier s and s so it sort of solved itself. Im currently at  battles with  tier s  tier  and  tier s unlocked but not bought. A benefit to having higher tier tanks is that they find their niche whereas with lower tier tanks theyre mostly the same  there are minor differences but having  different tier  mediums seems redundant to me. I really would not recommend rushing to tier  without having a good grasp of the game otherwise you and your teams will likely have a bad time. I see the game as having  main parts  Tiers  Tiers  and Tiers  where each bracket is more difficult expensive and complicated than the last and the foundation built from the previous section gets relied upon as you encounter new difficulties. So in summation I would say if youre comfortable and confident in your capabilities at tier  then you may as well stay there for a bit if youre having fun. If it begins to stagnate then youve got a great basis for figuring out which higher tiers you want to go for. However if you continue on to higher tiers without narrowing down your focus youre going to have an extremely difficult time making a profit and an even harder time making enough to afford a tier  within a reasonable amount of time.,WorldofTanks,ddz0wck,2,t5_2s113

10932412,0,t1_de7j4vz,This isnt a glitch a bug or an exploit its the system that WG set up for testing because they want testers to have access to any tank they wish to test and so everyone can see the costs.The difference between gold spam on the test server and an exploit is that an exploit relies on unintended mechanics being manipulated. People having a lot of silver and buying premium rounds is basic economics and is absolutely intended.Just to be clear I dont think glitching or exploiting is wrong as long as it can reasonably be done by anyone doesnt deprive players of agency like a bug that would get someone irreversibly stuck or makes someone invulnerable and doesnt crash the gamedo other things that have outofgame consequences.If the devs dont like any of the emergent behavior its in their power to change it. But if they build a special test environment they should be aware of the variables they themselves have changed and be able to analyze the results they get before pushing everything asis to the live server. As for extending blame to the players that depends entirely on how outoftheordinary the behavior is. If they got the silver or premium rounds through unusual means that only certain players were aware of youd have a case to shift some of the blame to them. But when literally every tester gets a functionally unlimited supply of silver and gold you cant blame them for acting in an economic sense rationally.,WorldofTanks,de7lnpd,3,t5_2s113

Just from personal experience as a heavy I feel your struggle with Erlenberg. Shares the same problem as open maps where heavies dont have a clear engagement zone. Poking the  and  lines are dangerous because both sides have easy camp spots for TDs but thats pretty much your best bet.I will share some advice that I have had slight success with. On occasion pushing down the middle through the city can allow you good cover from snipers and arty while also allowing flanking shots on the sides of the map.

11012244,0,t3_5x8urv,It depends a lot on the premium tank.  In particular how bad the standard pen is vs. how good the premium pen is.     Defender has same standard pen as IS which is considered to have pretty good pen.  I expect Defender players to still carry a healthy amount just in case but theres not too much reason to go completely excessive with goldspam.    On the other hand tanks like the Churchill  and IS have notoriously bad standard pen.  You can expect these players to carry a higher percentage of premium ammo and to be more willing to resort to goldspam.   For many players the point of premium tanks is to grind credits for something that theyre short on.  While premium tanks can afford to goldspam more than a regular tank with the same pen a lot of players will still try to be a little responsible with their credits so that they can buy their shiny new Tier  or whatever it is sooner.,WorldofTanks,deg7gsj,1,t5_2s113

The Foch  used to be basically invulnerable from the front was one of the faster tier  tanks and had a mm autoloader with  shells and a  second reload between them. All mm and mm guns back then did  damage per round so unless you were a Maus E or Tortoise that thing would clip you from full health in  seconds and you couldnt do anything about it. And the Grille  predecessor the Waffle auf E had a mm  round autoloader or a mm  round autoloader. The mm had a  second reload between shots or something like that and would do about  damage in  seconds. So it would clip a Maus before it could even reload once.

Youll take a little bit of a hit on progress in the secondaries but youll more than make up for it by not being generally gimped.By the time you get up into higher tiers even if youre not spending a dime you should have enough saved up enough gold from various sources to  retrain crews.    If you do spend money then the extra gold leftover after buying premium time is enough to do a full man crew when training is on sale.Dont retrain crews for different vehicle classes unless youre retraining with gold.There is almost no reason to ever run a crew that doesnt have  in their primary qualification.

11071307,0,t3_5y2k6m,When I encountered it in hull down positionI would load gold and shoot cupola for a quick dispatch. Never had issue against it. On the other hand I did wonders in it. Trick in this game is to use retard proof tanks in pubs. Tproto Tiger P e all those tanks are good against pubbies. Against unicums they are not. And this looks as a very hard game to master because there is a lot of bad players so these tanks do great most of the time. Te is trolliest of them all. I get HT . levels easy but next game I get snap shorted and penned even though I am in a better position then in previous match. So this tank trolls me some times but sometimes trolls the reds. All in all tank is boring because there is no oomph. It is useable in most situations but doesnt really excell in anything. Not the fastest no autoloader not the best depression not invulnerable hull down like is but good all around but with a little more wiggling now. Great but bland and still very useable.

Your hip cool streamer today will not be the hip cool streamer of the next gen.  They will move on because they do not want to be their parents.

It does not require someone to play the tank to be able to reasonably assess its impact upon the game and how the parameters should be changed for it to be on the power curve and not have a disproportionate impact on gameplay.As for having played the tank I indeed have. I have played it extensively on the test server for .. with around  battles on a server where only gold gets fired. It was still very heavily armoured in those circumstances pulling off a significant ricochet percentage. Further its gun performed admirably. Not only am I involved in the Public test server but I am also on the Sandbox on which it is again extremely powerful.I do have experience in the tank and playing against the tank.

Paper Mediums and fast E UDES TDs should scout then fall back to do damage from a distance and then rush late to perform cleanup duties on the enemy team.... but dont wait until youre the last tank just until your team has killed a few enemies so you dont have  tanks shooting you at the same time as you pop over a ridgeline.,WorldofTanks,dfkmhfh,5,t5_2s113

11433800,0,t1_dfry8gg,I mean thats not what happens at all. Arty was designed to do exactly what youre talking about digging out heavy tanks or TDs in good positions.  However as is evident arty doesnt do that.  Arty goes for tanks it can easily hit and do damage to.  That means arty is unlikely to shoot at a hulldown IS because itll not hit for very much damage...instead arty would rather shoot the medium or light tank because if he hits hell do lots of damage.This actually PUNISHES tanks for not camping which is the reverse of what arty SHOULD be doing.  The original intent of arty is to prevent camping by punishing those who sit in a corner hulldown.

If they really want lights to play supportrecon roles they need to make the maps bigger and significantly nerf the viewrange of every nonscout tank.  I dont think theyll do this and kinda hope they dont because itll just turn WoT into a supreme campfest.

To integrate all these classes all these playstyles then to have them at the whim of the playerbase at large in a game people who are notorious for managing to break things or operate outside all theory.I just think it was supremely ambitious in the first place to try to rebalance the whole light tank class as well as add another group at higher tiers with all the caveats that entails and get them out in a timely fashion without a massive amount of real testing. Who knows maybe the patch changes are just a small last minute test and were overreacting. Maybe its just a last idea to give a go but is not really being considered and will be reverted to the CT  values.Only time will tell but it does raise suspicions and Im still not sold on the idea as is. ,WorldofTanks,dfywanl,1,t5_2s113

Obviously poachingbuying a player from another pro team is a completely different situation theyre a known commodity. Naturally WoT has a slightly different setup  the lack of a ranked ladder currently for starters and the comparatively small esports scene is a huge factor too so its hard to draw a direct comparison.

11613904,0,t3_65qsry,I have a post that goes fairly indepth about the LT shuffle and how to prepare for it hereFor your Bulldog situation Your Bulldog will retain its XP. You will get the T unlocked but will not get a free one. The T will go on to the T gt TE gt T Heavy. You can also go by way of the Bulldog gt TE. If you have the T unlocked by tomorrow you will get . million credits if you have the Bulldog in your garage or a free Bulldog if you do not.For what its worth the new T is going to be really really good in my opinion. If you compare its stats to those of the old Tier VI LTs it looks choice. Personally I cant wait to play it in the new reality.Edit The takeaway here is that if what you want is primarily the T Heavy you shouldnt do anything.
