I know that effects can be distracting. I felt that way watching the last hobbit movie when I could see green screen and cgi in every scene because it was so over used.,Terminator,cse0lqc,1,t5_2qpmd

4468494,0,t3_3c7jz9,China is the wildcard.I do what I can to analyzelook at box office stuff first time poster here and huge Terminator fan so I wanted to see if there was a Terminator subreddit.If the movie releases in China  and its not a given  it could do extremely well there. Weve seen a ton of sequels launch there and do incredibly well. I would imagine that Arnold is known well there and thered be quite a few people wanting to watch the movie. If it releases there it could do enough money to make a sequel desirable especially given the growth of the Chinese market.But if it doesnt release in China... A sequel will be very difficult as its doing well overseas but bad in the US.,Terminator,cstxgh2,1,t5_2qpmd

4496441,0,t1_css3l57,gtHow did the T bring the deactivated T back to lifehe used the liquid metal to repair him...it is strang though....the liquid metal seems to go into his read.gtHow did shooting that same T through the heart earlier cause it to deactivate? Is that where their power unit is?Probably....or probably some vital part...still the T probably should at least have applied his liquid metal ball to the ts heart....,Terminator,csxflqn,2,t5_2qpmd
4513182,0,t3_3cvenl,My biggest issue is actually the visual aesthetic.Every movie in the franchise thats shown us the future barring Salvation has this...Far Cry  Blood Dragon look to it. With chrome robots and brightly colored plasma weapons at night and stuff.Salvation was a lot of daytime action with some dirty older robots and ordinary guns. As such Id love the sequels to get to the point I described above namely plasma weapons.,Terminator,cszj7rt,3,t5_2qpmd
4514581,0,t3_3cvenl,Not about the war. Thats for sure. For some reason everyone who has directed a sequel after the first two seems to think fans are not interested in the actual war between Skynet and humanity.,Terminator,cszpitc,-1,t5_2qpmd

4943516,0,t1_cuhmh5z,None really. For most part being made to wait played out in my favour it meant that I watched many of the great classic films at a age I could fully appreciate them first time round.The only thing that didnt play out well because of this is that I cannot stomach horror films. Whilst all my friends grew up with them I didnt watch one until I was  so naturally I freaked the fuck out at every jump scare.,Terminator,cuho483,1,t5_2qpmd

7260873,0,t1_d237vr1,I think it goes without saying that Skynet is one of the most illogical A.I. villains ever.  It would make loads of sense to use something like mustard gas on the battlefield but instead it decided to give its main ground force guns that can be used by humans.  If I didnt know any better I would think that Skynet actually wants the humans to win.,Terminator,d23idgf,2,t5_2qpmd

8861742,0,t3_51jh1z,I loved the episode where a terminator was sent back too far in time and became a prominent businessman. BTW their casting for terminators was always on point. ,Terminator,d7d21se,5,t5_2qpmd
9656945,0,t1_da37pko,Oh yeah given enough time a trap would have definitely been set. I like what you and CDSmodel said about the T not expecting to run into the T....this makes the most sense to me. Once they met T had to change his plan constantly and was at the mercy of Johns commands. I guess even if a gun store raid like in T happened before the mall there really wouldnt be much that would help against . The full auto assault rifle shot through the tanker windshield slowed it down more than I thought it would.  That was point blank though and no LA gun store is going to have stuff like that anyway. ddI hated how in Genisys no gun did anything at all to slow down that T....when Kyle opens up on it with full auto it literally doesnt even flinch.....the . Sarah fires doesnt do jack shit either.....yet a couple shots with a .? when he first shows up does stop it for a few moments??? Totally unrelated....sorry for the ramble.,Terminator,da3f4iw,2,t5_2qpmd
9856141,0,t1_daro94n,Basically if you travel to the past and change something in your life that timeline where you didnt change anything still exists but only for the people left inside of it you having changed something are stuck in the new time line and cannot return to the old one,Terminator,dasa0y7,1,t5_2qpmd
10315551,0,t1_dcc8m8o,In order to Skynet have a worry about delaying Judgment Day itd require the resistance quite often sending back these reprogrammed older units through time. Otherwise the reprogrammed units gonna be on the battlefield fighting alongside of the resistance which got littletono effect considering an airstrike from a HK wouldnt leave much of them.The only advantages these units could be would be the intelligence benefits of their knowledge of general Skynet procedures and locations of certain things along with being a bullet sponge or distraction for the resistance fighters if they attack or retreat. So theyd give benefit to the resistance only in guerilla style hitnrun operations but in larger combat scenarios theyd provide only a little more difficulty than humans.Consider that the units under Skynets control mostly are equipped with various plasma rifles and in the hands of a T Beta combat unit those things are deadly and accurate. Pretty much a oneshotkill for a human but a threeshot burst on the chest center mass for another T is also an instant out of order deal.Since the T Beta combat units got that effectiveness especially when morethanone of them attacking a reprogrammed unit  once again  theres no point for Skynet to develop the TX series and set up mass production of it.It just wouldnt be efficient use of resources.BTW even if the resistance would masstransport reprogrammed terminators back through time Skynet would need to know at least the general time and place where theyve been sent in order to send a TX after them. also thatd be a real clusterfck for the timeline with roughly zero control for Skynet over the changes in past cause having a bunch of resistance units and terminators duking it out would surely get some attention from the people living around the event,Terminator,dcdbo4j,1,t5_2qpmd
