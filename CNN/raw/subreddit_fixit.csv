If you know anyone who does know this stuff that can help you out and make sure you stay safe in the process you might be able to work out the problem.

1259392,0,t1_cib79pt,Very cool. You can fix this yourself for about  dollars American.Before I start I try to explain everything in the simplest possible terms as if I was speaking to a child whos new to the subject. Please dont take it personal its not. I work construction in New Jersey...........nuf said. For the sake of clarity check out this diagram A ptrap uses waste water to block sewer gases from entering the home and killing you. The only source of water entering that ptrap is from the dishwasher via the flexible hose.  Your dishwasher uses hot water to clean and rinse. Dishwashers hook only to the hot water line  F minimum .  All of the food and grime that comes off your dishes  soap  VERY hot water comes out of that flex line and into the ptrap via the STANDPIPE  tailpiece open black tube.The problem as I see it is that the mixture of soap  food  hot water  lets call it SOUP is being emptied into an open pipeptrap. Now this Soup is sitting in the ptrap . It starts out hot and steamy the moisture your experiencing. Than it rots the bad smell.  Worst part is since the trap never completely empties it will mix some of the old soup with the new ensuring a bad smelling cycle. FUNLets fix this shall we. Before you go to the store check to make sure that the flex line reaches the nipple on the disposal. If not message meYou will need from the hardware store          ABS gluecement         a saw that can cut abs pipe in a tight space          ABS hub coupling  same size that ptrap is attached to         a hose clamp that will fit over the flex line with  to spare         a pair of work gloves          small bucket for under the sinkSteps. Glove up. Remove  the flex line from the standpipe  ptrap and slide a hose clamp over it        . Attach the flex line to the nipple on the disposal        . Tighten clamp.        . Run the dishwasher and check for leaks.No Leaks....... Glove up  Put bucket under the unused ptrap Disassemble the ptrap and dump water old soup in bucket   Remove bucket  Take the saw and cut above and below the tee fitting on the vertical pipe. TRY TO CUT STRAIGHT Glue the ABS coupling where the tee fitting use to be.Go on reddit and tell US how it went.,fixit,cibap8y,2,t5_2rf27

Youre going to want to cut in a warm environment and cut a little slower or youll end up breaking or chipping your cuts. If you make a jig thats always helpful. I like to cut soffit with the nail flange towards me in the jig. It is easier to hold that way and less hand prints. Make sure you pull the soffit taut and square before nailing. If its not square youll see it in your last piece and probably the peak. If you cut it too big it may bend your fascia later on.When we put fascia in we nailed it from the bottom flange the  part with matching trim nails into the overhang. I tried to hit where the soffit met the wood as to not booger up the soffit. Start from the bottom and go up. The top of the fascia slides up under the drip edge.

Either with baby stuff some people use it to mix formula or with bottled water.Id give it a brief submersion to soften up any deposits. Then a few rinses. Use fresh water each time. What youre doing is rinsing any anything left by the beer. Since distilled water is pure when it evaporates it wont leave anything behind.

Then OP can shut the feed and power to the unit off while a replacement is sourced at the hardware store. Over pressure valves are installed near the top of the tank and only the accumulated air and any crud that collected in the valve need be vented. Running the tap on the nearest sink will not vent this accumulated air. The over pressure valve needs to be opened to vent it and a little water needs to be run out this valve to clean the seal of any debris. If it doesnt reseal on the first try opening and closing the valve a few times usually clears any debris on the seal. If it still leaks after this is was in need of replacement anyway.  ,fixit,d4smjmi,1,t5_2rf27

10067714,0,t3_5jxsnp,Its entirely possible however working with wires that small is pretty complicated.  You just need to take your time.Carefully cut back the black sheathing a bit only like half an inch to an inch and you should see  wires under there each probably wrapped in its own sheathing.  Do the same to both wires which are probably  or  gauge stranded wire.  Then repeat for the other wire.Then follow this guide for each of the wires to splice them together.  Just make sure you splice the correct wires to each other.  Typically one will have a single line of an off color on the sheathing so youll have like one white wire and one white with a single blue stripe running down it or something like that.  Just match each one back together and splice.Good luck and god speed.,fixit,dbjuh11,6,t5_2rf27

10083426,0,t1_dblviql,Any twoyear old battery will be showing its age. Even if the battery is functional you wont regret plopping in a new one. When you order the battery be sure to order adhesive strips or have some quality doublesided sticky tape to glue the new one in.When removing the old battery pull the adhesive tabs slowly and wiggle them back and forth if they stop stretching. If the tabs snap try youre best to reach under and grab them. If you cant pry the battery gently with something nonmetallic. Have fun ,fixit,dblw194,2,t5_2rf27

10814774,0,t1_ddvdnq5,Sure cheapest is best and chokes on the power supplies wont hurt anything.  But when he says the the electricity is shit in the house and its an issue in my electricity on the entire floor then I suspect its too many devices on a single circuit along with the fridge likely going bad since this seems to be a new problem.I asked for a description of his service box but nothing yet.  That will confirm or eliminate a lot of variables.  If he has only a amp service with  circuits for the entire house and he has a lot of things plugged in cant ignore those phantom loads a motor going bad will likely draw down the entire house.  OTOH a amp box with separate circuits for every room points to over issues.His wireless modem is operating at . GHzGhz I cant fathom a transient motor arc producing enough RF at those frequencies to disrupt his switch or WiFi modem.  However if his switch and fridge are both on a amp breaker the motor going bad will draw down that circuit and get near the point of tripping that breaker.I think we still need a lot of details from him before suggesting anything more.  I described a procedure for him to ID the relevant circuits in the house in case the service box isnt labelled.  Once we know more we can provide better solutions.,fixit,ddvguiy,2,t5_2rf27
