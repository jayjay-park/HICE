3021411,0,t1_cob3v62,Yeah thats kind of the whole point. They put it under fake proof when i know i dodnt submit any proof. So  years down the drain to get reset. Its like i walked out of a store w a stick of gum i forgot i put in my pocket getting caught and instead of getting charged w theft of something under a dollar they charge me w armed robery. ,Gamebattles,cob60am,1,t5_2sril

7785399,0,t1_d3qvsso,Through a staff members perspective which means using around . of the brain?  The only way I can get a picture saying last met  minutes ago is after we play a match believe it or not. I didnt have him in my party he joined and wouldnt stop trying to get me to cancel or reschedule. My point and still unanswered is how this retard can just not show up for nd map and not forfeit. I dont care what perspective you have HE DIDNT SHOW UP. I WAS HOST YOU GUYS MADE THE NEW HOSTING SYSTEM REMEMBER? There is clear proof backing up my claims. Hard to get perfect proof for you dipshits when you dont take voice. You also have a rule where you have  minutes between maps. NOT  minutes. Then you said we were disagreeing with who refused to continue the match? I HOST nd map buddy the only person not wanting to play is him. So basically he didnt join  minutes between maps but that rule doesnt apply to him?,Gamebattles,d3r4uu0,1,t5_2sril

9167911,0,t1_d8dvt20,Yeah they booted my teammate and cant boot me because of my college Internet so we ended the game two times because youre allowed to do that on this game if theres disconnection issues and they left quick when they realized they couldnt boot me lol..

9553858,0,t3_5bg5cc,Sorry for the frustration this has caused. I am glad this is sorted! To clarify the part about the Halloween promotion is apart of a canned response we have so that wasnt his fault. That will be updated shortly.,Gamebattles,d9qpku0,1,t5_2sril
