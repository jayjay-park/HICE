4739093,0,t1_ctrw6m7,This isnt teaching a match up its bragging about how you destroyed someone  and you were making excuses for why you lost.  If you want to brag about how good you are go somewhere else this should be a positive community.,GreninjaMains,ctrwnj6,3,t5_39b8r

5589930,0,t1_cwpmrri,I think its really cool to see videos like that and what is possible...but then again its so unrealistic if I see this in tourney and not performed on Wifi against people who obviously are bad then I would be more impressed. But it is a cool video. ,GreninjaMains,cwpzeoi,1,t5_39b8r
5768357,0,t1_cxb9lyj,Practice the hell out of it in training mode. Also connect the intervals of the inputs to a song or noise. I think of the drum beat from the song Chelsea Dagger.,GreninjaMains,cxc49au,1,t5_39b8r
6510372,0,t3_44t7w3,Same. Ive noticed that Corrin is just at the right weight for combo potential. Makes the match up just a bit better. ,GreninjaMains,czsq0pz,1,t5_39b8r
7422212,0,t3_4gxeia,Id like to understand but I cant see how you can short hop into a short hop thats two short hops no ?Also maybe that will help you but if you do several special attacks in the air you will not gain that little floaty moment you will fall like if you fast fall. So do  neutral B in the same jump the second one will not maintain you in the air,GreninjaMains,d2luv4k,1,t5_39b8r
