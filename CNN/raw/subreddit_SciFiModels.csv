2026796,0,t1_ckxfjs8,No problemo. Those are really the only ones youre gonna get though. Ebay will probably gouge you. Id say put a few extra bucks away every paycheck and just pick up Moya. It looks like a really nice and detailed model.,SciFiModels,ckxg6bb,2,t5_2vewj
2435963,0,t3_2l1rv6,Depending on how much detail you actually need and the scale you need you can do this almost for free. When I was a kid I took an old model die cast car and a couple disposable razors some glue and some spray paint and ended up with something very credible especially with single source lighting.I guess this post is pretty old now but I think the answer is it depends.,SciFiModels,cmcsham,2,t5_2vewj

5192709,0,t1_cv9052f,I agree with you. The Snap Tite models are cheap and easy to throw together. And it doesnt take much work to make them look good. The hardest part is finding or making decal sheets for them,SciFiModels,cvbwxv7,2,t5_2vewj
6081778,0,t3_3yunix,Bandai had one in production early this year I dont see why it wont still be released. It had a fiberoptic lighting kit as well. ,SciFiModels,cygsx4x,2,t5_2vewj

7176898,0,t1_d1tvs7j,Well... Theres a very good hangar set from Oddysey slipways in the ssm store. Also the engine bells from the same manufacturer and store. Shapeways sells a replacement set for the deflector domes as well as the radar array. Arvey model products sells a set containing a new bridge neck guns and sidewalls you can actually get a devastator or an avenger set. Id highly recommend all of these. Also youll be needing a couple hundred greeblies for the superstructure and about a kilometer of fibre optics  If you need help let me know. I recently finished building one with al mentioned upgrades.,SciFiModels,d1ty4qq,5,t5_2vewj
