10625104,0,t1_ddbs3qh,I dont have an article for you.I spent over an hour on the phone with Verizon Support yesterday to find this out.We have  people in the home who use Verizon Message for texting two different phone manufacturers and I use Textra.  After the Verizon Message app update I could send them texts but they could no longer send texts to me. Ive been able to verify this with other Textra users.  I dont know how many third party messaging apps are affected but Textra is for sure.  Until Verizon fixes Messages you wont be receiving texts from people who use the Verizon text app as long as youre on Textra.,textra,ddbwcpr,1,t5_2ynad
