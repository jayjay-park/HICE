9663643,0,t1_da3pmve,Just want to point out that the Shun classic line uses VGMAX and the Tojiro DP line uses VG which may explain the differences in edge retention.  However according to this chart VGMAX is hardened to the same HRC as VG typically is. VGMAX is proprietary and only Shun uses it so no one can really know for sure.,chefknives,da48vg8,2,t5_33l1t

9726770,0,t1_da93a6t,I follow Maangchi on Youtube for Korean cooking.  The knife knife she uses in all her videos always cuts nicely.  I always assumed she must have some mystic Asian knife maintenance dance.  Nupe pull through sharpenerThese work but they are not exactly foolproof.  If you want to get the most out of them you need to make sure the slot angle matches your bevel angle.  If there is a mismatch youll need to work very hard the first time to remove metal until it matches.You also need to be aware of how much force to use  too much and you can create waves in the edge.  Burrs are also created very easily on pull through carbide sharpeners so youll need to learn to check and handle those.The result will not be as good as other methods of sharpening.  But for people who care more about cooking than knives this is a good solution.,chefknives,dac1d9k,1,t5_33l1t
9767175,0,t1_dagygbk, I figured you all might. Its a custom piece made by a friend of mine. It started out as an old billhook  the European agricultural tool we found at a flea market in Belgium. He then turned it into this monster and had a friend of his rehandle it. Its seriously heavy like almost lbs. Only used it once so far to separate a lambs neck from the shoulder. Scared myself a little at how easy that went through. Bonus closeup pic  It would take a bit of digging through old pics but Im sure I have pics of the original piece and some workinprogress pictures somewhereif anyone is interested.  ,chefknives,dah0rqd,8,t5_33l1t

10165724,0,t1_dbvx744,I would hesitate to suggest you get terribly deep into stones before you have comparable knives but I do stand by what I wrote in the rest of the thread. You might get your toes wet with a  grit stone by itself. Used on knives that are in decent shape I dont think theres a better way to learn to sharpen than to focus on mastering the k before buying other stones. Again I think the Naniwa Pro is worth every dollar. Failing that the Bester  is a good choice and so might be the Shapton Pro .,chefknives,dbwca4j,2,t5_33l1t
10169988,0,t1_dbwrpsv,gtWestern style Japanese knife usually refers to the shape of the handle No it does not. It refers to the purpose. Western style knives are double beveled blades like the Chefs Slicer etc. The Japanese do not traditionally have these. ,chefknives,dbwtob8,1,t5_33l1t

The butcher is also very good for breaking chickens.    I have the cleaver in this steel easy to sharpen stays sharp for several sessions.  The least expensive of my recs another very well received knife.  And its a Suisin.The HenkKramer is not getting a lot of love.  They are getting a lot of returns.Good luck with your search.For moms knife this is solid.  My mother has one  For stones I like the K Gesshin combo from JKI.

11252034,0,t3_60bopa,Globals have this issue as well but Ive seen it on a lot of Japanese knives with poor production quality. If a knife maker were to make a first attempt at correcting it depending on the severity they would take what is essentially just a x with a few sawn out slots slip the blade into the slot and attempt to bend it back into place. Anything more labor intensive than that is honestly not worth it for those knives. Anyway thats just a hypothetical situation. They would probably replace it for free. That being said its also possible it came like that and you simply didnt notice it until now. First thing I do when looking at a knife to buy is make sure the blade and handle are aligned properly. Not always possible to see the knife in person but youll ensure you get what you are looking for if you get to inspect the actual knife youll be using. ,chefknives,df7egkf,2,t5_33l1t
