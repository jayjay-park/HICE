6494797,0,t3_44kz97,What the what?!? Thats amazing ... are those completely legit? Honestly I hadnt really expected to be able to get those so high but looking at the code I can see how it could happen each new Creature can get up to  more of the base stat than the higher of the KQs.Im in two minds here Big numbers are fun so maybe this is a good thing  given the rate at which population costs increase it doesnt look gamebreaking right? I could change the way stats increase to be a max of per  generations or something like that. This would make reaching even thousands much much slower. Bear in mind for either option that there will be a lot of ways to boost everything in the game that currently arent implemented like  cookie production research techsedit  in the short term Ill just add the formatting that large numbers get to the Derp stats display so youll see k vs  etc.,SlurpyDerpy,czr3z1m,1,t5_3ca0k
6547409,0,t3_45bcw9,Whats up alpha testers! The screenshot shows what my view of the research tree looks like in Unity as Im editing it along with a sneakpeek at the new planned Powers. The top shows the behindthescenes view with the coordinates of the really massive hex grid Im laying out research nodes on. The bottom show the resulting view as it will show up in the game.Ive spent too much grr time building tools so that this is easy to edit  add nodes to etc. Im not sure itll stay symmetrical but for now you can see each of the different research types leads to  boost nodes followed by an unlockable Power Instant Breed will be one of these. The  new Powers are planned to be   Sugar Rush  a fixedtime version of what happens when you come back and use lots of offline time. Probably something like x speed for  seconds  Energy cost.   Patch Up  this is related to the warfare setup which wont be in for a while but this will heal your Derps inout of combat to help push through difficult enemies. Love Potion  x increased breeding time for  seconds  Energy cost to use.Like everything else all numbers subject to change let me know what you think! ,SlurpyDerpy,czwk0dt,2,t5_3ca0k
6826242,0,t1_d0q1u0w,Theyre randomized ... thats pretty lucky! ,SlurpyDerpy,d0q1ycr,1,t5_3ca0k
6988129,0,t1_d18e1vw,I dont agree. Purely because that is based on our species. Just because our species is that way does not mean the derp species is the same way. Look at the angler fish where the female is a massive hulking monster but the male is a tiny piddly thing.Currently my bred derps have the females being Stronger and faster with the males being healthier and smarter the exact opposite of human tropes. The whole point of this game is natural selection well artificial selection via us but you get the point. People could end up with any combination of malefemale splits purely due to the mechanics of the game so forcing that would make no sense. ,SlurpyDerpy,d18g1wk,1,t5_3ca0k

7376716,0,t1_d2gnv47,its possible ... the way the game logs everything now it should be easy to see if you look at the console when trying to cloud save though! ,SlurpyDerpy,d2goj8z,1,t5_3ca0k
7492482,0,t3_4hzuek,Hey thanks for the feedback this sorta situation has been possible at the higherend for a while  no its not where I want the game to be!I like the stacking buffs a lot but it has created this situation where its possible to end up with effectively infinite buff timers if you have enough Derps. Creative solutions to this appreciated!,SlurpyDerpy,d2tus03,1,t5_3ca0k
7494018,0,t1_d2ts68l,well ive been working on reearning reaper since that update what added more research nodes  i literally devolved before reloading game and discovering reaper was gone D   i should get him in next day or  ,SlurpyDerpy,d2u133h,1,t5_3ca0k
7497883,0,t1_d2tvzp1,Yes I see them even playing locally. CPU spikes and the game. As for why I remote into home machines when at work or traveling.  Lets me keep work and other things  separate and not have to juggle things around.,SlurpyDerpy,d2ugy5j,1,t5_3ca0k
7503924,0,t3_4i4r10,You can research anything in the  categories so long as you have enough skills to. You are not limited to researching only  branch. Have you tried clicking on the other branches with some derps in research? Also when you devolve research stays. So you can continue researching even as you restart your deps you will not lose research. ,SlurpyDerpy,d2v5nwp,2,t5_3ca0k
7506361,0,t1_d2vc7uw,I agree about the devolve problem. The problem is once you devolve it takes forever to get back where you were sometimes.People have made some complaints that some of the mutations have insane requirements.I am apt to agree. I understand needing some tough stats to reach them but the current requirements feel a tad too steep for what you get out of them.,SlurpyDerpy,d2vfnvq,2,t5_3ca0k
7508189,0,t1_d2vhi6s,Yeah its a kong bug in how theyre gating access to guest URLs. Good news is that the game is in review and longer term theyre taking a look at how to create a better system than their current Beta  concept. ,SlurpyDerpy,d2vn5qn,1,t5_3ca0k
7658632,0,t1_d3cq51p,Im sorry if I sounded rude but he was reffering to researching universities so you Actually yes it would. reffered to that as well and I didnt want to let that misleading information there in case someone may get the wrong idea.,SlurpyDerpy,d3cqrfn,0,t5_3ca0k
8587145,0,t1_d6evric,Well how about a new ability just for scouting then? I agree that would be nice to have. ,SlurpyDerpy,d6ezc85,1,t5_3ca0k
8971824,0,t3_5350id,I build an autohotkey script some time ago that would spin the wheel  times and then cash in potions and spin again. That running for hours helps a lot with progress. But doing that manually is not fun at all... ,SlurpyDerpy,d7qa061,1,t5_3ca0k
9063849,0,t1_d80yw1a,The way the game is set up currently there are clearly some bestpractice type things like maxing out the gods but theres also a LOT that comes down to player choice. The math behind working out whats actually optimal is so complex that I dont think it can really become completely generic ... at least not until someone builds some software to work it out! For allornothing choices ... I get the appeal but in a casualidle game most players wont want this. Especially if it leads to cases where you end up suboptimal with no way to remedy!,SlurpyDerpy,d81bts2,1,t5_3ca0k
9233578,0,t1_d8mejer,basically yea LOL to start with it didnt have the right save so I closed came back synced on the front page hit start had the right save and  days of timewarp XD,SlurpyDerpy,d8mf9ce,1,t5_3ca0k
9249077,0,t1_d8oa6rn,Yeah woohoo juice during warp is generally a good play you can do BOTH if you spam L hotkey with one hand and click map with the other.Bob Also,SlurpyDerpy,d8odzng,1,t5_3ca0k
9259038,0,t3_575y1q,Thanks for the update it looks great.. Just one thingNoticed this on army screenI had a heart attack thinking I accidentally made a bunch of cheese places but they are actually armories with the wrong symbol?,SlurpyDerpy,d8pner5,2,t5_3ca0k
9445990,0,t1_d9d11h7,More so than the other artifacts  OAnd since people have so many excess slurpies they can afford to blow  at a time respecing RADS then NO PROBLEM!  Is it worth it perhaps.  If it would give  directions then Id say its better than all but  or  artifacts.,SlurpyDerpy,d9dcgtg,1,t5_3ca0k
9613601,0,t1_d9xz29m,Worse than the one you assigned to KQ yes but better than nothing. With the KQ being autosacrificed theres always much fewer Reapertagged derps in your queue meaning it takes forever to fill up a particular job.Imagine I come back after a couple hours of idling. My derps are now much higher than they were before. So I want to replace my current work force of  workers lets say. I kill them all if they havent already been killed in battle and then I have to babysit the breeding queue for  minutes in order to snag enough Reaperd derps to fill the job line whereas before I could just use the  Reaperd derps already in the breeding queue and then  seconds to get the rest. It was quick and painless.Dont get me wrong the current system is a great buff to Reaper. But it would just be nice if you could toggle it on and off. That way when we need to update a work force we could toggle it off for a few minutes come back replace derps without any hassle and then toggle it back on. Best of both worlds.,SlurpyDerpy,d9y2ns1,3,t5_3ca0k
9625916,0,t1_d9rrqb8,This bug is still happening after the most recent update I just lost another  hours of time warp while Im at the hospital with my son. My phone was connected to the WiFi at the hospital but I had no Internet access because I didnt click I accept yet. Opened the game not realizing this and I lost my time warp because it couldnt talk to the server. Any idea when this will be fixed? Im just going to take a break from the game for now because it has no consistent offline idling system. ,SlurpyDerpy,d9zlc81,1,t5_3ca0k
9721512,0,t3_5ecdau,I know right? Moonbase sucked and Ive just finished itI actually blew a load of slurpies on free free evolves just to escapeCelestial forge seems a LOT more normal,SlurpyDerpy,dabdzju,1,t5_3ca0k
9728212,0,t1_dac7ibn,Shame to see you go. Its funny how these things works though. The constant changes are whats keeping me playing ,SlurpyDerpy,dac7r7b,1,t5_3ca0k
10426597,0,t1_dcoz6gq,Thanks ... does completely closing and reopening FF get this to work? Does it happen every time or intermittently? ,SlurpyDerpy,dcpx979,1,t5_3ca0k
10885386,0,t1_de2pteb,gt If we play the test version can the save be imported in the final version?Thats the plan ... Im now writing every update to be backwardforward compatible. At worst therell be some sort of partial reset if something has to be massively rebalanced.gt And if so I think you said slurpies can be imported from the old game does that work with a already running game or do you have to do it at the beginning?Im planning on making this a onetime deal that you can do at any point.,SlurpyDerpy,de2r0if,2,t5_3ca0k
11001031,0,t3_5x1g1x,I have Triggs at e right now.As far as mutation points I have x Wisdom x Equalizer and x Talented.Right now its just a holding pattern.  Sign on every few hours to burn time warp hope for a slurpy and pound boot camp to get stats up.,SlurpyDerpy,deexne5,1,t5_3ca0k
11082934,0,t1_deo807h,I agree it is going to be hard to balance these things as it depends on what people choose what to research and mutate. Maybe we can assume they will get at least one wisdom out of the new mutation points so with the doubling of gains on evolution gives you  times longer minus what new mutations you pick. Of course it will most likely better than that at least in the earlier evolutions and slow down in the later evolutions as the main driver mutation points become less powerful individually. That could partly explain why the last evolution before the meta evolution was so painful last time.,SlurpyDerpy,deo8oe1,1,t5_3ca0k
11217434,0,t1_df3322k,This exactly. We dont have enough for leftovers at this point. Consequently there are two obvious choices that Ill pump points into until the cows come home.Even Moon Base I couldnt care less about  the pop because stats improvement appears to be more influential than simply adding another body.,SlurpyDerpy,df3hdoh,1,t5_3ca0k

11321666,0,t1_dfevhnp,Laggy? You should try playing on a browser that supports WebGL as it has some nice performance boosts over WebGL The latest Firefox and Chrome have it enabled by default. Ive only tested Firefox Dev but the game runs extremely well with minimal CPU and GPU usage now.,SlurpyDerpy,dffaiiq,2,t5_3ca0k
11346803,0,t3_61tsz3,You usually want a few points in talented to start out. To get your stats up faster wisdom is good to start with. And besides that a bit of extra breeding speed never hurt anyone either.,SlurpyDerpy,dfi51lr,1,t5_3ca0k
11383932,0,t3_62g5gb,Hey glad you like it ... it is fun gt   Is there anyway to stop Time Warp partwsy through? Or to use only a portion of my available time warp?Not by default although there is a midgame ish artifact that does this ... the original reasoning for this was that it would feel too micromanagey and part of the reason for implementing offline time like this was to give that arg everything is out of control feeling gt  ...Its entirely encouraged to do stuff during TW ... if you do it ends up massively more efficient than just watching!,SlurpyDerpy,dfmcl6l,1,t5_3ca0k

11786526,0,t3_67zq1o,I dont get have enough slurpies to activate my artifacts to look at raids  looks super cool though!I think somehow this update might have broken something though  Ive been playing for about a week on a laptop with a touch screen and have exclusively been using the a touch screen to play. However since the update came out the touch screen no longer works and I have to use hotkeysmouse. Touch screen works everywhere else just not for Slurpy Derpy. Its the same on the itch.io version though I hadnt tested it on that site before to know if it worked there previously. Any ideas why that might be? ,SlurpyDerpy,dgw1iqd,1,t5_3ca0k
