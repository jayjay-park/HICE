And they have hero without armor here and there which I generally come across and I would love giving it to them. Besides why would you desire to have more than one account? Its just an app not a p.c system game. Would you do this twice just for the sake of more gold. When you reach a certain part in the game the importance of gold drops off a bit cause you yourself make so much.Edit it could cost  or  gems to gift items ,farawaykingdom,cny03si,1,t5_30c65

3246968,0,t1_coyiq0n,good point and even makes it a better idea to me then I like the epics to be a considerably better quality then their epic because right now only real bonus an Epic has is their weaponshield benefit which unless its an epic weapon to begin with isnt that high of a bonus to begin with easily offset by the benefit the rare has with such a high discount to PC i could argue the point to use eitheror for epicrare unless you have the epic weapon then I would say go Epic for sureampnbspThe difference in elements with this kind of mechanism would make the choice really a critical choice rather then merely weighing costdamage as your deciding factor youd have to strategically work it out perfect example Shadow heros typically have abysmal Nature element stats passable in an Epic but ex. my rare Ornis has a pathetic  nature lol. A frost hero tends to avg  nature for a rare in the right house is passible the developers could even rework the stats for rareepics to reflect certain differences like this too That would add a HUGE amount of strategy to the game even down to the element hero you decide to go with. Awesome ideas,farawaykingdom,coyk1q1,1,t5_30c65
3321441,0,t3_2y6z9f,Its totally sheer luck. I like to believe Diamonds increase your odds a little though especially after Ive used Friendship Points.

3697412,0,t3_32ozfp,I think to keep new players turn over rate low you should rethink how to retain new players. There is nothing I hate more in game with gacha aspect for me to get into and after investing some time into it turns out that I had made a mistake in choosing my starter roll that will gip my ability to progress well into the game. I remembered how difficult it was to understand the game. I remember thinking that I can evolve my epic  star to  starfor new player I suggest first starting roll guaranteed star or better epic. This significantly reduce the reroll aspect of the game and retain beginners who found out that after they got abit more into the game that they started off well,farawaykingdom,cqdqa2s,4,t5_30c65

3878950,0,t3_34txcw,For people who can never reach top   of world boss I want to illustrate the facts when deciding between Herman or Vanna.  ampnbspActive Skill Herman is the strongest mage with Focus and Vanna is the strongest mage with Freeze.ampnbspDamage Potential Assuming neutral element world boss Vanna overpowers Herman.ampnbspTeam cost Vanna cost  and Herman cost .ampnbspSubstitutability Tiantian and Our Ladys Bug are viable alternatives that can use Freeze. Bianca and Lord Bluemoons are viable alternatives for Focus but very few players use Bianca because of her naturally low damage stats and high costs.ampnbspTime Investment Herman takes less exp to get to max level and thus can reach his max base stats a lot faster than Vanna. Assuming you can only level up Herman or Vanna you have to decide if youre in favor of short term gains or long term rewards. ampnbspElemental Advantage Vanna has the highest dark damage potential and the third highest in game behind Vi and Vermillion. Herman is easily overpowered by Vermillion. ampnbspMP Problems Neither heroes seem to have MP problems such as the one faced by VermillionampnbspHP Neither mage can tank one hit from a world boss.ampnbspLet me know what you think  and if youd like a comparison with Bjorn VS Red Riding Hood. ,farawaykingdom,cqyfmvc,2,t5_30c65
