I took advantage of it when my son was a newborn but I think I need to start doing that again and then use the time saved to prep meals!I will say that one thing I try to do is whenever I make something that I really love that is a little time consuming a few signature dishes I make at least a double batch so I can freeze some.  ,workingmoms,ctk9lm3,2,t5_2yusr

4794016,0,t3_3giu7p,I dont have any advice but I will tell you what we did. When we moved to a new area we had a month old and a .yearold. We chose a daycare where they could both go sight unseen. It was good for the most part but suffered from poor leadership so the standards for teachers were not very high. We had a few instances of clear rule breaking such as my infant watching cartoons on a teachers phone for extended periods. Anywho we had both girls on the list for a better daycare only  more at a center but we had to stagger their transition dates. We sacrificed and did  dropoffs pickups each day for  months because we really felt strongly about getting both girls transitioned as soon as possible. It was a huge pain because even though my husband and I each took one girl but there were constantly special events where we would have to switch a car seat swap days etc. But now we are on the other side with both girls at one place and it is much easier. My job hours are flexible but very long so I often clip a bit in mornings or afternoons only to work for  hours at night. If I minimize my time in transit I dont have to work so much at night. So its definitely job and persondependent. One thing we had to contend with was that the daycares closed at different times so sometimes I had to rush to the farther daycare to pick up one girl drive back past work to pick up the other then drive back the other way to go home. A minute commute when I lived  miles from work was infuriating! Do you value more time with your kiddos and are you ok spending it in the car talking singing etc.? Or would you rather have them at home a few minutes more in the morning and evening? Try to narrow down whats most important then try it out. You can always change your mind later so try to leave open some possibilities if youre not sure. I worried a lot about moving here using a daycare for  year then switching daycares but my daughter has adjusted like a champ. Best wishes! ,workingmoms,ctytpdt,4,t5_2yusr

5265142,0,t3_3n4eup,Thats too many babies! Omg! I might try to find alternative emergency care. Our state mandates  at that age which I still think is a bit high. I cant imagine ! Can you stay home? If thats a possibility I might do that. At least until something is done about the ratio which might be corrected after the visit at least long enough for you to get baby into the new place. There should never be more babies then the state mandates. At my center if one carer needs to go to the bathroom they call someone else in even for those few minutes.Can you call the new place and tell them its an emergency and ask if theres any way for room to be made a bit early? ,workingmoms,cvkoi7c,3,t5_2yusr

5559343,0,t3_3r8twe,I hear you girl. Pumping sucks. I get designated breaks at work but only  minutes split into  tens. By the time I got all set up I didnt have any time for myself to break. Its awful.Do you have a way to work while you pump? You can make a handsfree bra by cutting  small holes in an old sports bra and sewing around the edges so they dont tear more. Sadly I have a job where I work directly with members so I couldnt pump while working but I could while driving.Id say that if youre having this much trouble for your own health and sanity go ahead and stop pumping at work and feed your baby at home. As you grow to hate pumping more and more your supply will start to suffer like mine did and if you feel that passionately about nursing its not worth it. Trust me.,workingmoms,cwm6ra1,5,t5_2yusr

5729666,0,t3_3tl0xj,Tell them!  It will make everyones lives easier and youll feel better for supporting her the best you can.  I pumped for both LOs st for a year exclusively as in all pump no bottle the nd for  months.  My reccs  by no means hard an fast rules but this is what made the system roll well for me.   a pump at home and one at work.  I had a room that locked up so I had a secure place.  I didnt buy the nd pump until LO but wish I would have earlier.  Hauling a double Medelea every day and night... oy.   Three sets of bottles One dirty from LO eating that day to go into the dishwasher One clean to pack for the following morning one set that I filled that day for LO to eat the next day.  So a set for me a for LO a set that is dirty.  If you can tell I tried to pack as much as I could the night before to avoid hectic mornings... which can be unpredictable anyway with young ones.  I had a list to help my tired mommybrain and it helped things go more easily.    If something will help your family youre the rule maker.  Dont let someone from the other side of the interwebz make rules that arent real or guilt trip you.  Be smart protect your supply but keep your sanity too.    Make sure youre drinking enough that was the hardest part for me.  Best wishes its rewarding to do as much as works for you.  ,workingmoms,cx7bk4l,2,t5_2yusr

7069153,0,t3_4cbzu5,My husband was the SAHP with our first daughter. Your son likely doesnt react to you leaving because you have proven to him that you will always come back.  Thats a great thing! Its a trust thing! That doesnt mean he doesnt miss you just that you are dependable.  Make the most out of your evenings and weekends with him and your attachment is just going to grow.

7204305,0,t3_4e2rsf,I had to write a brief while I was being induced and answer emails as soon as the pain meds wore off from my C section. I wanted to take time off but I am a lawyer in a small specialized area of law. Several other attorneys and a couple judges just wouldnt let me have the time off. Law is still a sexist profession. Anyway ir is doable. It sucked. But it could have worked if I had been able to hire more help. For me the big problem with working with a newborn is that you are constantly interrupted. Ir shreds my focus and causes mistakes. I have to plan for it. Also the sleep deprivation kills creativity. You can struggle through basic tasks but it is very difficult to think. Finally unless you are one of the women who breast feeds easily it is not possible to breast feed exclusively and function in the world for some women. Some women get lucky and breast feeding is easier than bottles. But for some of us the time and effort required is INSANE. Things like cluster feeding would be a Geneva convention violation and it is also horrifically painful which can be mentally exhausting. I gave it up after I realized the stress I was putting us all through. I dont regret it and I wont try to exclusively breast feed again if we have a baby. Its going to be different for every woman but dont feel bad if you cant do it. You have to keep yourself and your family happy. I do love not having to be away from my daughter and fir the most part it worked out. I wish I had hired a scheduler and a mothers helper for every work day. But we didnt have the resources and it worked out. Feel free to PM me. And congrats on your baby!!! I LOVE bring a mom. It is the most amazing thing! ,workingmoms,d1x2lmv,3,t5_2yusr

Were not even Christian so I asked lots of questions.  The extent of the churchs involvement in our particular center is that. Once a week the pastor comes and reads the kids a Bible story and they sing some songs.. The church ladies make each child a personalized blanket with their name embroidered on it.. A few times a year the church members cook a free dinner for all the daycare parents.I can live with that. p,workingmoms,d4qmdk9,2,t5_2yusr

8206042,0,t3_4rpoap,Id probably stay out of it.Side note My kid gets bitten at least once a week. Its by the same kid each time and this kid is biting a lot of other kids and its been going on for months so Im probably biased here.The thing is we all know biting is normal for this age and that its just a thing thats going to happen. Its super hard on the biters parents because they arent physically present at the time of the bite. There are some kids who will only bite in certain circumstances that cant be recreated at home another kid invades space or has a toy he wants etc so its hard for that parent to do anything about it.That said the toddler teacher has said that its more generalized aggression and it sounds like its been going on for a while. The teachers have a responsibility to all the kids in the classroom to keep them safe. I dont know whats been done to handle the situation already but Im guessing that whatever they have the capability to do its not enough to fulfill that commitment to the other kids. Its awful for this mom and I know if it was my kid Id be really upset too... but in the end if the daycare isnt able to control the kid theyre not able to do it. Its not fair to your kid or the other kids in the room to have to deal with that.,workingmoms,d53b605,5,t5_2yusr

I work from home so I was fortunate enough to have this option and would recommend it if you can. It helped me get my fix but also allowed me to watch the caregivers with the other kids.

8810041,0,t3_50t81r,I think theres a lot of good advice here this is such a crappy situation.

8811657,0,t1_d76n428,Stop thinking of it as paying to work really. Its a toxic thought process.You dont think of housing costs as an optional thing that only you pay for. You dont think Im just working to pay the grocery bill! But consistently women will say they have to stay at home because it doesnt make sense for them to pay to work. You have higher total expenses now as a family. You are entitled to continue your career and enjoy it. This is not the issue of you either staying home to take care of kids or working to pay for childcare its the issue that your family now has another bill to cover. If you dont want to stay home then just dont stay home. Its not you being a bad mom for selfishly working even though it costs money in daycare its you being a grounded mom who knows shes not interested in exchanging her beloved career for being a homemaker and child minder during the day. ,workingmoms,d771i5v,4,t5_2yusr
9350525,0,t3_58hxeq,I experienced a pumping output drop around  or  months went back to work at  weeks. Its tough to say if my supply decreased or I just wasnt responding to the pump very well anymore but probably a combination of both especially with all the solids she started eating. I had to add an evening session so I pumped  times at work and once before bed. I also kept up with the evening session on the weekends. I wanted to make it one year and I did but happily gave up the pump then. I did have to supplement from my stash frequently because I really stopped responding to the pump around  months or so but fortunately LOs milk intake at daycare dropped a bit at that point too. When I first went back to work I was pumping between  and  ounces during my work day and at the end I was pumping maybe  ounces during my work day. My first few periods post partum were really heavy too.,workingmoms,d918w9d,1,t5_2yusr
