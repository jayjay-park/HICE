774093,0,t3_1xty1i,go to shows and dj nights that are posted in public and meet people and get fliers.also if youre booking shows try not to let people congregate outside between bands where they can be seen from the street.places with fewer neighbors are better.most show shutdowns come from the cops driving by and seeing a crowd or from a noise complaint.,Bostonmusic,cgs9opz,1,t5_2sutg

6255526,0,t3_415jg9,Id potentially be interested too. Im in Brighton too and have a basement we could practice in. The only experience I have in a band was in high school but I played for an audience recently and really liked it so Im interested. I play guitar lead or rythym and have a sweet new hollow body. Im a little older just turned ! but as long as people are cool age doesnt matter to me.  ,Bostonmusic,cz0oo7o,3,t5_2sutg
6673465,0,t1_d09kz2b,was just curious on your specific story since you said scam.  ive booked through them a few times now received pay given saturdays etc but i have noticed some poorly run shows by them.  was curious what you went thru.  some of the shows they put on have left me scratching my head but my personal experience booking with them has been relatively mundane like the rest of the promoters around here.,Bostonmusic,d09le9t,1,t5_2sutg
