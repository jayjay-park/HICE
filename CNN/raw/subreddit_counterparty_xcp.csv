3406577,0,t3_2z7n65,At least two reasons Vitalik Buterin is a prodigy famous among Bitcoiners Ethereum aims to create something completely new Counterparty is more of a conservative . approachIs Ethereum better? No Counterparty is live on mainnet it is integrated with Bitcoin several mln dollar projects run on Counterparty smart contracts are scheduled for mainnet soon.Can Ethereum become better?

4819650,0,t3_3gw2dw,Ethereum is new.. and ripe for the pump and dump.. hence the hype. To suggest its ambitious is a understatement. Good luck to them but its more likely to be  Bitcoin for a while. Invest and hold for a few years and take that gamble.. just like all the rest.CounterParty is stable and works  ripe for developers to take advantage of. Symbionts use of CounterParty is unclear but likely given those founding devs investment in CounterParty.. and afaik two devs moved to Symbiont. See more at ,counterparty_xcp,cu221my,-1,t5_30318
4947502,0,t1_cuhif7b,Ill highlight some passages from the announcement and a couple quotes from Counterparty founders on Bitcointalk. It seems you had a bit of trouble comprehending what they said which is fine. I hope this helps.gtCounterparty is a core part of the Symbiont tech stack with entirely complementary technology to the other systems we are developing.gtnothing has changed with respect to our enthusiasm for the potential of Counterparty and permissioned ledgers will augment Symbionts platform offerings not compete with the many market uses for Counterparty.gtWe will continue to support the Counterparty ecosystem by providing development resources funding Ivana Zuber in her position as Executive Director of the Counterparty Foundation and handling incoming business development inquiries. gtHowever as we onboard more clients and partners and develop more products we will not be able to discuss if why or how that client product uses or does not use Counterparty. Determining use of Counterparty should be clear to anyone via a Counterparty block explorer.And the quotes from BitcointalkgtThats not what the post said at all. The technology that Symbiont has developed outside of Counterparty does not overlap or compete with Counterparty at all. Theyre different things for different uses one being private networkprivate blockchainpermissioned access and the other Counterparty being public blockchain public ledger open access.gtTo reiterate Counterparty is still being actively supported and developed by symbiont staff members nonetheless. You can see that just by looking at the github.,counterparty_xcp,cui68e9,1,t5_30318
