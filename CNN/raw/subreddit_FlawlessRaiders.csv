5248186,0,t3_3mvh9q, hunter is my main I do have a warlock whos like  or  but hunter is my main . Have experience in all of Destiny adapt really easily and learned the fights the first time I beat Kings Fall so the second time was extremely easy for my parts of the raid at least my teammates still have some troubles. Also have all that shit you guys got getting all  exotic swords actually when arms day comes. Do good in crucible but dont really enjoy it as much as I do in PvE unless its trials. I brought my KDR tracking thing or whatever from like  to  when trials released because of how much I enjoy thatdo good in it too. Trials has a lot of team stuff compared to regular crucible which is why I love it. Im usually the team leader in every activity I do like raids and trials. I dont get along with elitists that kind of act like theyre better than their teammates though or when someone is appointed as a team leader but dont take any criticism or listen to other ideas first week of the raid this one guy said he knew what to do on Warpriest and made us stay on it for  hours before he left and we did my idea and it worked. Those are basically my requirements as long as you guys dont act like douchebags Im all for it. A lot of people say theyre chill but they really arent chill they have some kind of ego because they have cool gear etc. So if there is anyone like that Im not going to be enjoying it and wouldnt wanna join. When someone fucks up I help them out and tell them what to do better etc. I wont bash them if your group is the same Im down. Only problem is I have a couple friends I raid with but I do want to get into the more serious shit. So Ill be juggling raids with you guys and them for now until we need to do KF a lot to get everything good for hard mode. Let me know if youre down.,FlawlessRaiders,cvilfu9,1,t5_3a4lo

5457228,0,t1_cw48ld6,Hi Im interested in joining.  I work at  PM PST but I imagine a well equipped group can get this done in less than  hours. I have a  warlock and a  hunter Titan if a different class is needed with spindle ToM  weapons in every category.  Just cant get the damn boots or ghost to drop at  lol.  Very experienced with all raids. And Im an ER worker so I have nerves of steel and know how to stay cool Gt Makapuu,FlawlessRaiders,cw97nw2,1,t5_3a4lo

5588630,0,t3_3rk9bi,I could do it on Tuesday nights.  I have a  warlock  hunter and  titan with  clears thus far.  Did you guys do the raid this week?  I still have to run it on my Warlock and hunter.  I might have another friend that would be interested too. psn treymendus,FlawlessRaiders,cwptlby,1,t5_3a4lo
