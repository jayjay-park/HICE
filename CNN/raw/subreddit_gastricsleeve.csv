Since I was a child I hadnt eaten poultry or seafood and then over the last couple of years reduced my beef and pork intake and as of April I believe I havent had any meat.Our foods arent all or fully Vegetarian but most are gluten free. We offer bars shakes meal replacements concentrates supplementsvitamins chipspretzelssoy snacks oatmeal soupsstews pasta and pasta flavor packs. You can get a smoothie base mix and add your own flavor or get the flavor packs from us. You can mix n match. Get our pasta and create your own sauce or get a flavor pack from us. Yesterday I used a chocolate smoothie and instead of putting it in water I used actual chocolate milk. Its getting cold over here in FL so soon I will be having our Chili. I am a soup kind of girl.Our link is www.bariatricfooddirect.com and if you use code REDDIT at checkout you can get  off. Youd be our first customer from reddit Thank you so much for responding.
