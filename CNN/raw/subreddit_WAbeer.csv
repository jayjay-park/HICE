7641281,0,t1_d26frzn,Salish Sea Brewing and American Brewing are walking dx for me both have good beer.  American Brewing is now owned by Pacific Brewing amp Malting of Tacoma.  OP should be aware that Salish Sea Brewing does not bottle or can their beer at this time the only option for taking beer off prem for later consumption would be in a growler.  American has their beer in bottles and cans. ,WAbeer,d3ars0s,1,t5_2vdid
