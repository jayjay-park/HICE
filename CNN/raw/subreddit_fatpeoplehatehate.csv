3759986,0,t3_32euv4,No one will see this but you and thats okay. From all the experience Ive gotten from lurking reddit and being a fat fuck myself the main problems with fatties is vulnerability. No one likes to feel vulnerable its a sign of weakness. When some people gain weight like myself they see the world grow smaller around them and they get scared and they hole up inside their own minds. Too scared to come out and seek the help they need. On the contrary when others are faced with the same problem they flaunt it publicly instead demonizing anyone who says otherwise just so they dont have to feel vulnerable. In both of these cases the people suffer from some kind of body dismorphic disorder.  They are too scared to ask for help which in the their minds is a sign of weakness and the problem hemorrhages from there. Now saying all that FPH is harsh its meant to be. They mainly target the fatties who flaunt their fatness. The ones who think society should change its beauty standards because they dont want to feel vulnerable. Being fat is unhealthy extremely unhealthy there no its and or buts about it. Those who say otherwise are just lying to themselves.   FPH doesnt hate fat people they hate fat people that dont do anything about it. They dont want you to stay fat its called tough love and sadly most people cant deal with that these days. ,fatpeoplehatehate,cqkv71j,0,t5_330lo
