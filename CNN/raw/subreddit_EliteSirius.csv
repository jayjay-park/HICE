4300405,0,t1_csaawuy,Regardless of who the troublemakers are I believe the first and foremost concern should always be to enjoy what youre doing  you can be sure the other guys are. If you enjoy fighting it should not matter how many times someone can afford their insurance. Youre not doing this for their enjoyment youre doing it for your own and the good of Sirius Gov of course for which you have every other agents appreciation.If you dont much care for fighting then you should avoid it. Consider these hostile Commanders your sparring partners and learn how to evade them. See if you can maybe learn a few tricks and extract fun for yourself from that. Fly what you can afford to lose with similar ease as they can and always consider your cargo when deciding where and... with whom to fly.As a case in point about half an hour ago I was returning to Lembava in my Type and shortly after jumping in Commander Semtro of Archon Delaines crew tried to interdict me in a FerDeLance. Since I was so close to the star I promptly approached it and denied him the interdiction. After returning to super cruise I found him out there again and kept evading him while he fruitlessly buzzed around me.While evading I asked what he wants on the local channel and gave him ample time to provide an answer since I realized he might have had his hands full. Mind you this whole time he was preoccupied with me he did not have the capacity to chase anyone else. I wasnt fighting him but neither was he getting anything done. I was having fun evading him however. When I received no reply from him I told him I dont provide amusement for mutes exited super cruise and vanished on him. No doubt he searched my FSD wake only to find nothing.He probably would not enjoy having to deal with the likes of me over and over again.Do I get shot down occasionally? Sure theres a lot of more talented and better equipped fighters out there since thats not what Ive set out to do. Even if it was there would always be someone better. I try to be proactive and it saves me a lot of frustration but when someone catches up with me I switch gears to achieve whatever I was set out to do. Reaching your goals despite a momentary setback is the best medicine for that particular sting.So what should Commander Semtro have said to keep my attention? Hes with Delaine so he should have acted like a pirate. Demanded that I drop out of super cruise and come to a halt so that he can scan my cargo and realize Im not carrying anything at the time then let me go. If he wants a confrontation with me and hes unable to do that much he does not add to my fun.And I am after all the arbiter of my own fun.,EliteSirius,csadovw,7,t5_38ig6

To mitigate this we have to fortify  other systems which shouldnt be cancelled week by week. ampnbspPerhaps you find in a  ly perimeter another candidate with better conditions. If we prep this alternative Ruchbah would also become a Sirius System because it would be inside the alternative CS Bubble.ampnbspAt the moment the first threshold is  cc profit if possible with an LPad System inside. The second lower threshold is Proft  Upkeep gt  cc. So we can mitigate the minus through direct fortify. Eventually we could think also about a portfolio mitigation means If you found a system for e.g. with cc Profit a second system with only cc then the average of  would not harm our balance.ampnbspSorry for that strict number oriented but as Falava explained we are only a small smart sirius family.

6419764,0,t1_czjb9d8,I honestly wish we had a recording of the meeting to share publicly but we didnt record it. SCRAP was originally designed to counter bad expansions and not to manage the economy of the entire power. However it very quickly exploded and became used for that purpose.We are not removing SCRAP simply limiting support of SCRAP by our government exclusively to expansions. SCRAP in and of itself is bigger than Sirius and has become more than a Sirius program but a method used by several factions regardless of who participates in the actual activity of SCRAPing the systems in question.gt SCRAPing control systems when invited by the owner is not aggressive towards rd parties and rd parties arent directly affected by it.The board agreed with your stance initially. However the stance from the Federation was very clear. That stance was that providing official SCRAP support on control systems to an enemy in which they undermine in targeted ways essentially derails their offensive which does directly affect their war efforts.gt I get the feeling that we conceded a lot to the Feds while receiving nothing in return. I would like to get some confirmation that my worries are not correct.I understand this perception but I do not share it in any way. We havent conceded anything to the Federation. Ive said it several times and will say it as many times as I have to. The only real changes at this point are honoring the initial intention of SCRAP and ensuring that the board is more proactive in communicating publicly so that the other powers Not just the Federation can see and understand our stance.There is nothing stopping other factions from posting SCRAP requests on their own Reddits and nothing stopping an individual from helping with a SCRAP request. What we will be doing however is ensuring that the board only considers and posts SCRAP targets for expansion systems. For those who want to grind merits for the sake of grinding and thus not really help anyone at all we will be publishing a list of recognized grinder systems for each faction like our own Heverduduna.If people want to be hostile and actively damage other powers then being a member of Li YongRui isnt actually where that individual belongs and they should reconsider which power they are pledged to but we cant force them and we wont try.Control systems are already controlled and its up to each individual power to manage and shed their unwanted systems themselves. Handshake undermining the act of two friendly powers using piracy to undermine each other with organized trading of commodities in space is far more effective than a SiriusGov combatant will ever be as each merit earned that way is x more valuable than a combat merit. In my opinion this is all the justification needed for Sirius not to provide SCRAP services on control systems. I hardly consider that conceding anything. If anything it makes the Boards workload lighter as we wont have to provide support for anything other than expansions.,EliteSirius,czjc94m,0,t5_38ig6
6450624,0,t3_43ts7i,Thank you for the excellent work to all of the departing CMDRs s to you all!And best of luck to the new board!,EliteSirius,czmjaca,1,t5_38ig6
6715424,0,t3_47lixz,Well on the first parts the attacks by NPCs is unfortunately outside the control of the player community and indeed faction neutrality does not extend to the AI. But in the end any faction you join you will be attacked by NPCs of other factions its a game function we have no control over unfortunately. But LYRs neutrality is a great benefit. It prevents you from being attacked by PP CMDRs. I can happily fly to Cubeo and then to Sol and then up to Alliance space redeeming my combat bond vouchers and doing tradingmissions without fear of being interdicted by any PP focused player wings. Sure it doesnt protect me from random CMDRs who solely aim to murder but at least if I am attacked and call on that factions defense force to track that guy down and kill him because im not an enemy of anyone. If you join the Imperials which I was once a member of entering Federal space becomes very dangerous and in many ways it limits you more than the small size of LYR bubble and will definitely leave you under more threat. On the PP bonuses if ofc the bonuses offered dont suite your play style then it is a shame not much can be done but still the good outfitting and ship buying discounts are a great bonus and hence why despite LYRs size it is in fact very heavily populated because almost everyone will buy from us if they can. Sure our rewards arent the most rewarding if your a trader but very often the losses from poorer rewards can be made up for by the fact you wont be killed as often you can go anywhere and trade with anyone safely and PP monetary bonuses from merits. Unfortunately LYR doesnt have a massive focus on trade and so if your a trader youll probably end profit more under another power but not everything needs to be about profit and LYRs bonuses arent completely useless with the exploration bonus you can quite easily get a nice boost with discovery scanner scans as you travel from place to place when trading. And given the LYR playerbase isnt that large despite the large amount of players who are in LYR space many are simply here for our galaxy winning shipyards the threat of saturated markers is IMO a low one and shouldnt be much of an issue any time soon. While Zermina Torval may be have better trade bonuses you do pay with once again the fact that trading those slaves to Federal space becomes incredibly dangerous as you will have players hunting for you.And on the last point. Yes we arent as powerful as the major factions we never will be but we will survive because we have a bonus simply too important for anyone to actually ignore which is our ship discounts. Its in the interest of the other powers to respect our neutrality and to keep us around even whenif complete faction distraction is added as we can give a great resource to everyone which everyone uses hence why we do have a lot of players inside our systems I mean my home system of LHS  can often have into the double figure player counts due to its excellent station right next to a HazRes site and those players often come from every power Ive even seen ALD and Hudson players in the same place not killing each other because of how good the HazRes site is you cant find that in too many places!In the end size or power doesnt matter its how you use it. And I believe Sirius is a great power because we dont have enemies attempting to kill us at every turn Federation and Empire but we also dont seclude ourselves and keep to our own little bubble like the Alliance allowing for at least a bit of drama often forced onto us due to the attraction from our great assets attracting characters of all sorts and we still are powerful enough to be respected given we are the most powerful of the independent factions often being the highest Ind faction on the leaderboard. What LYR and Sirius corp. As a whole offers is flexibility through our neutrality but still having a concrete influence in the galaxy which is unique and indespensible. ,EliteSirius,d0dxlaj,6,t5_38ig6

7477452,0,t3_4hrjem,Ok nice try. I have three major remarks Please use the correct numbers. There is no point discussing based on wrong numbers. The list of topics is totally arbitrary. Some topics are more important than others. Its not an eitheror question. There are two independent questions. Comparing systems doesnt make sense.The numbers Static income for Babaradhbh is  CC. Its    overlapping system Wakadiini   upkeep. The overlapping system has been pointed out several times now Please adjust your numbers. Static income for Chang O is  CC.    HIP    upkeep. You seem to be aware of the overlap here.You are inconsistent with your numbers. Which raises the question why do you adjust Chang O but not Babaradhbh for overlap?!Second lets add the following topics Is the name pronounceable? This is a win for Chang O. Which name comes first in the alphabet? This is a win for Babaradhbh. Which name sounds more cool? This is a win for Chang O. Which name has more words? This is a win for Chang O. Which name has less syllabi? This is a win for Chang O.Im sure I can add many more if I want to.I hope my point is clear it is not about the number of advantages or disadvantages as one can make up any number of unimportant topics.Some topics are more important than others. Just counting topics doesnt make much sense.Lastly I dont know why you make it a Chang O vs Babaradhbh thing. They are not exclusive. We can have both none Chang O or Babaradhbh. All combinations are possible.So there are two questions to answer here Do we want Babaradhbh? and Do we want Chang O?With that being said lets evaluate the two systems.For me the simple fact that the Static Income is below  is enough to vote NO to Babaradhbh. Yes negative income weighs very heavy.Chang O has disadvantages true. You might have noticed that it has been prepared several times already but never expanded.  Thats because we dont really care about expanding it. We just recommend to prepare it as we have to prepare something. I would say Dont care for Chang O but I wont argue against a No.,EliteSirius,d2s56dv,2,t5_38ig6
