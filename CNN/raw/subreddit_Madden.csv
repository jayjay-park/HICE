455088,0,t1_cfrz96b,ah  its hard to make strides as a Qb unless your actually playing Or you went to a team with an Aging QB like i said i dont play much player mode but my best advice would be to only throw to guys that are wide open at least until your stats are up a bit.  make sure you get your throw power as high as possible. and in order to get your overall up and not get replaced on the depth chart you will have to pump your characters awarness. The stat itself will do nothing in game for you except raise your overall.Depending on how many years in you are id maybe advise a restart as a high draft pick so your overall is higher.

The engine has been used in GTA. Its called the Euphoria engine and the game was called Backbreaker. It failed because it didnt have the NFL license for the teams and the realistic st person view created a huge learning curve. Anyone who is interested here is a short video showing a RB stretching for the extra yard on a rd down run.

1857765,0,t3_2fv7y8,Relatively new at the game and the sport itself. I recommend a channel on Youtube called MaddenMastermind. If anyone can recommend other channels please share here in comments too.Start playing the game on Pro difficulty and use the GameFlow playcalling. Start by understanding the value of passing and running plays. Also a quick tip when you choose a play press the RRT button to show the playart before you snap the ball. Take a look at the QB. If the arrow moving back is short expect to make a quick pass. If the arrow moving back is long then you should expect to take some time in the pocket. However YMMV.Also just watch football. Theres so much to learn in this game that you can pick up just from seeing the real action. Prepare to have your self esteem blown to bits when playing online. I just stick to playing as my team in a career mode to have the most fun.Also Madden  has plenty of drills to help you learn the basics of the game! Good luck!,Madden,ckd20os,1,t5_2rjpr

2408568,0,t1_cm68qqi,Which setting is that? I changed game speed from slow to fast seems to have only removed the stupid fadetoblackontimeoutsinthelastmins kinda crap. Which is cool but not what I was looking for.   Im talking about the actual animation speed. Ive been meaning to time how long it takes a player to run a certain distance bc it just seems like Madden players are half speed vs real life. Even if its an unplayable novelty bc of reaction time etc Id like to try playing the game as close to real life speed as possible and thats what I was asking about. If a player can run a . yd dash Id like to see that kind of speed in the game. Is this something that just cant be done?  I ask because I know they use motion capture for these games is this method just not advanced enough to allow games to accurately recreate real life or is this still a hardware limitation issue? To my uneducated self Id think directly capturing the movement of a person would translate to the game accurately reflecting the motion of a person speed and all. ,Madden,cm9ep2j,1,t5_2rjpr

2706108,0,t3_2qyadd,Youre pretty much using it right. Lob passes are a very situational thing and theyre mostly used when you receiver is going deep and you need to give him time to get separation or you need to give him time to increase his separation. You can also use the lob on a coupe other routes out of the backfield and on wheel routes out of a bunch formation but its mostly just for deep routes.

Basically just run even with him while hes going horizontally and force him out of bounds or to make a cut right into you. For RB screens I generally just user a linebacker right into him.

3827622,0,t1_cqr5efc,To expound upon whats already been said  slants and drags attack the shallow middle of the field generally so if the defense is dedicating resources to stopping that you should be looking to attack other areas. You first need to identify what coverage is being used against you. Based on what you posted Im going to guess your opponent is likely calling Cover  perhaps Cover  sink so you need to learn how to attack those defenses.Easy difficulty  yards on the sideline. Streaks Curls Deep out. Anything that attacks that region.Medium Comeback C Route as I call it and certain smash concepts will beat Cover Hard Deep between the safeties. Especially against Cover  sink this will be difficult but easier against what I call vanilla Cover . A verticals concept or more likely divide concept can work between the safeties if you have the talent to execute it. Maybe this is easier for some people but I dont have a ton of success with it despite it being a natural weakness of Cover  defenses. Depending on the play you can sometimes sneak a easy pass to a TE running a seam route as well.,Madden,cqskxcj,1,t5_2rjpr

3977107,0,t3_35voni,I had   and .  After  I swore I would never buy another Madden game again. Along comes the PS and the rave and insipidly paidfor reviews of Madden ...and I am disgusted even moreso than with .  The artwork outside the field looks like it was done by epileptic  year olds. A fake twitter feed that takes  seconds to bypass so you can get to the roster menu. What the hell? Does anyone outside his immediate family actually care what Ross Tucker has to say about REAL football? The whole player development interface is such a complete mess. Why isnt it consistent with the roster interface? Why do I have to scroll back and forth  times to get to Qb. Why cant I give experience to a TE or FB?Why do created or edited players automatically get zero consistency?Still no play creator? Really?Why is the playbook editor such a fucked up piece of crap?Why do pulling guards run away from incoming defenders?Why when running a no huddle offense do I pull so many defenders into an encroachment penalty prior to even having the QB under center?Why when calling an audible does the occasional player just stand there preventing me from snapping the ball?Does anyone really think that added a  second delay to hot route assignments improves the play quality?This game would have been a marginal value at . I bought it for full retail and am as usual disappointed in the video game industry. I dont know for a fact that the developers of Madden  were under significant stress to provide a substandard product but I am fairly certain of it.,Madden,cr9mgvx,2,t5_2rjpr
3977760,0,t1_cr9oloq,Bell must not have updated roster abilities or you suck at running the ball. Im not being blatantly offensive. Im being honest without any embellishment for the sake of being rude. If youre having that much trouble running you need to simply get better at it.I have seen this major complaint that CPU quarterbacks have too high a completion percentage. They absolutely CAN. Especially on all Madden. But thats the point. If you play skyrim on legendary and have never played before you SHOULD get slaughtered. The same goes for madden.Its apparent to everyone man coverage got nerfd this game. So.. If that is your scheme Im sorry. Seattles zone dependent legion of boom is on the damn cover. So yeah. Zone coverage works the best and man coverage is merely a scheme to run once in a while to keep it from being obvious what youre doing every play. A changeup. With this said what the hell are you doing wrong? First off getting sacks is really quite easy. And after playing all madden with sliders as far as they can go to make shedding blocks harder for a while its still easy once you get accustomed. Because of this a qb spy with a smart fast linebacker relentless pressure and a solid dose of zone coverage should limit a qbs completion percentage. I know youre probably going to tell me you did all this and the same shit is still happening. If thats the case I dont know what to tell you. Lots of people have your issue. I do not. Every serious madden player I know does not whether Ive met them in online play or know them in person. It HAS happened sure its all madden and they finally boosted the AI so if the game is kicking your ass it would follow that the completion percentage follows that. But once you figure out what works for you it gets back to reality. And manziel is a physical nightmare. You put it on all madden. If you cant force him to run too much and force passes he will destroy you. Why? Because all madden is the hardest level in the game and qb is the most important position of the game. But if youre good youd rather face manziel than Aaron Rodgers. Peyton and Brady not such a big deal because if youre good you tend to be able to get pressure consistently.If none of this seems accurate to you or if you literally tried everything then stop playing the game. Im not trying to condescend. Im being serious. Either youre blowing off steam and are actually determined to improve your play or youre letting a  dollar video game frustrate you. There are many who dont have these problems you and many others have and there are countless threads on here from people who are so good the game is boring unless its against a person. Literally every single day these threads have multiple posts reflecting that. And I can confirm its not bogus egomania not for you obviously but for me. I know many people just like them that want jump the snap toned down for defensive backs to be better for qbs to be better at avoiding sacks for rbs to be better at running.The default difficulty settings are pretty clear. All madden isnt intended for everyone or even players whove played a long time. Maybe youre not as good as you want to think you are. Maybe youre really good at previous maddens and just thought youd walk into greatness with this one. I dont know why you would. I miss bitching about rushing about throwing picks about CPU qbs shredding me. Now without much effort as hard as I can make the game its easy. Why? Because I devoted time and effort to getting better. All these things youre complaining about are not happening to everyone despite these people having the same conditions as you. You are the difference.This is as nice as I get and Ive posted enough books for a while. If you still dont believe a word Im saying or think the game is shit then theres two lines you can get in. The line who thinks madden is shit and keeps buying it or the line that thinks madden is shit and does not buy it. Thems the facts.

And my evidence is every madden game Ive ever played. We will find something to whut it down but youre probably going to have to accept it will take a lot of unique adjustments. The best offensive plays always do.EDIT My hunch is that some combination of a middle blitz man coverage on the intended back and zone coverage in the back will shut this down based on it being a play action screen.

Marcel Reece is great to convert to TE excellent speed and catching ability along with a solid blocking game.Derek Carrier is a superb vertical threat prospect at TE.  speed and acceleration from memory I had a season where he was faster than all my WRs. His main let down is his catching ability though you can work on that and turn him into an elite player. Great size too. I like to have a backup QB who has half decent running ability for when you are just having one of those games and cant seem to complete a pass. Tebow Vick Pyror do that job pretty well. If I dont have a starting QB I like I usually trade for EJ Manuel or Geno Smith. Sometimes you can get them fairly cheap and they are pretty solid players Geno has a terrific deep pass and solid speed. I always end up replacing them through the draft after a few years when I find the guy that I like.Plaxico Burress is another beast who I almost forgot.

5150144,0,t3_3lfov9,I always pick by formation on both sides of the ball.  On offense I will call formations similar to what they usually run in real life.  The plays just generally work better that way than say trying to run an under center Philly offense. Play calling is all about down and distance and what kind of tone youre trying to set.  Ill use Philly as an example.  In the beginning of the game I pretty much always run the inside zone on first down.  Im trying to get Murray involved as much as possible and to make sure the other player notices it and tries to stop him.  This will make it much easier to pass the pall throughout the game.  When you can pop off a  or  yard run regularly on first down they will start bringing down safeties overshifting their Dline and Lbs press etc.  This will give you lots of favorable numbers match ups on the line and oneonones in the passing game.  An important part of play calling is deception.  When they think youre going to run you want to hit them with a quick out or maybe a vertical route taking advantage of that mancoverage blitz they called.   I love running the inside zone with Murray on first down  or  times on first down and then hitting them with a PA verts or crossing route over the middle.  Its open almost every time for a TD or huge gain.  You also want to be smart with how you pick your formation.  Say its th and short.  Is it smart to call a shotgun play effectively adding  yards or so to what you have to gain to convert?  No its not.  Even if Im playing with a shotgun heavy team I will usually go under center for late down short yardage plays.  Way easier to convert.  For defense I will usually go  or  on first and second down and then nickel or dime on third and long.  I usually stick to cover  or cover  plays given this years passing. I love deep zone blitz plays because they give you a lot of utility.  Theres this  cover  blitz that I call pretty regularly that has a lb blitzing to one side.  Whats great about this play is that I can do a lot of things with this LB.  I can obviously keep him blitzing for run support and to pressure the QB but I can also switch his assignment to QB spy and do a lot of things with it.  I love calling this play twice in a row and blitzing the first time.  On the second play I will show blitz with the same LB that blitzed but switch him to QB spy.  When the play is snapped I drop back and either actually spy the QB if hes a dual threat or drop back into coverage if hes a pocket passer.  I have a few other plays like this.  Basically you want to be able to give multiple looks with the same playformation.  Make him think youre blitzing and then drop back into coverage and confuse him.  By confusing him you can force him into bad throws and give your pass rush time to hurrysack him.  Another important thing is shifting your line not necessarily a play call but still related to ensure he doesnt have any numbers advantage.  Too many times Ill be able to basically run the same running play against someone because they absolutely refuse to shift their line to where Im running.  I think shifting your Dline is more important to stopping the run than any specific play calling.  You also want to take the other teams personnel into account which is more important on defense than offense imo though I still dont think Ive run one time at Watt when playing against the Texans....  For instance I will never ever ever let Megatron have any oneonones with my secondary.  You will get blown out if you do.  The same for Julio Jones and other star receivers.  When Im playing these times I will pretty much exclusively call cover  or cover  plays.  I rambled on pretty long but hopefully I helped you out some.  ,Madden,cv6saxb,1,t5_2rjpr

6022290,0,t3_3xy0f3,The way it works in Madden when you cut someone is that you save all the base salary going forward but all the prorated bonus money becomes due immediately though it is deferred until the next year.So lets say Suh is making  million base with a bonus of m over  years.  Normally that bonus would get prorated over the length of the contract so myear or mtotal or thereabouts all Madden contracts are backloaded so it would be less in year one and a lot more in year five.  If you cut him after the first year you have m in bonuses you havent paid yet or more accurately you have paid it but it hasnt counted against the cap yet.  That all becomes due so in year three youll be missing m in cap space.When you go to cut him the game will do the math and tell you what the penalty is.  You can still back out at that point.The year deferred is the tricky bit.  This is how this sort of thing sneaks up on people they dont see an immediate cap hit and think theyre okay but then the next year all of the sudden theyre broke.,Madden,cy91n59,4,t5_2rjpr

Without pass interference and holding and a challenge system that works its never going to play like the real thing so I dont expect people to pretend anymore.The one credit I give the game is that you can adjust better than ever. As long as youre patient on D there isnt an unstoppable play in the book anymore. Shift towards the side hes favoring or blitz or put everyone in coverage or press or play underneath or QB contain.  Vast majority of my interceptions are off of guys who cheese themselves right into my coverage.What does annoy me constant no huddle.

7140618,0,t3_4dccvq,Anyone who plays lobby ball should never complain about someone not being sim.  Lobby ball is for arcade gamers who are out to test their skill in that arcade arena.  Absolutely nothing wrong with that its no different than a Counter Strike player who wants to test his skill in that game.  But just like CS bears little resemblance to real world military tactics lobby ball amp MUT play bear almost no resemblance to the NFL.  One could know almost nothing about football Xs amp Os but excel in Madden lobby ball.    The purpose of a sim league is to get a group of guys who want to simulate actual football strategyplay to the extent the game can.  With a custom slider set a few loose rules for play calling and a group of like minds  you can get surprisingly close.  At this point it really can become an amazing battle of wits amp at least some semblance of football strategy.  The perception among folks who dont play this way is that there are  rules enforced upon each play.  The reality is that a lot of leagues can accomplish the above without a million rules.  Custom sliders alone make quite a large difference can really beef up the defensive side of things.  Plays that are extraordinarily powerful in lobby ball with the default slider set are a different proposition with custom sliders.    But yes anyone playing lobby ball complaining about guys not playing sim is not playing where they should be.  Go find a sim league and enjoy Madden that way it is an infinitely better experience.,Madden,d1pt811,4,t5_2rjpr

Didnt make the playoffs I think I had ? losses but my coworker won the Super Bowl with Payton Manning.Now were several weeks into the nd regular season. Ive moved the Eagles to London and became the Black Knights. Ive purchased two FA linebackers Arthur Jones and Kavell Connor and theyre helping a lot. I got the superstar of the draft Justin Tate CB with  speed but no tackle. Two OLine rookies have SS Dev. Im performing better with a  record.

Let two people play a player CFM and get drafted or play in the same team if they dont take it out. If they do look to get traded or same team in FA. Also combine drills and actual drafting of my players. I know everyone says this but K like presentation. They interview players during the games. Like the TV style segments.

Then take a look at  of the Buccaneers basically holding the D lineman although hes not actually holding the D lineman just has a problem shedding his block unrealistically. The same with  of the Buccaneers near the juke in real life the Saints player would easily come off that block and at least move within range of Martin but instead he stays sucked into the lineman while his head spins around like a poltergeist.

7761110,0,t3_4lk6to,I would still rather the soundtrack than what they did in madden . Sure it made it more intense but I prefer music when I comes to sports games.

7804235,0,t1_d3rzcok,I think somewhere in maddens OL coding there was an error in the pull blocks.

EA on the other hand half asses all levels of the game. Why? Because who the hell cares they basically have a monopoly at this point.

That shit is ridiculous. And a  overall linebacker shouldnt be able to push Luke Joeckel back  yards thats absurd. And the blocking mechanic is occasional? I have issues with it every couple of plays. Easy touchdowns turned into  or  yard gains because the AI is incredibly stupid. And you know what else really frustrates me? The fact that as you turn up the difficulty rather than the AI actually getting smarter it just gets increased chances of catching balls and interceptions and the like.Nobody consistently hits half court shots I dont know where youre getting that idea from.I dont want a k like sports game from EA. I like k more but I dont think its as far ahead as other people in this subreddit do think. I still do think it is ahead of Madden just not to the margin some people in this subreddit think so I do agree with you on that. My problem with madden is the fact that they dont fix their simple problems year to year and still charge . And people still buy it.

No matter what through my league experience HB toss strong close split close inside zone four verts z spot and dragslantstreak is run by every single player or at least most of them.  You can have playbook restrictions like customs having x amount of plays or customs can only be changes in audibles but its tough to enforce.You could always go the way of naming  scrubs Vikings playbook and patriots playbook then people can sign and trade them and thats the playbook they use.  They also become trading pieces which is cool but it means you can only have  players rather than  on the roster. ,Madden,d4y1irt,1,t5_2rjpr

Cant move players when ball is in the air and cant strafe to make a play. Way too many fumbles as well especially with vacuum tackle strips very infrequent on big hits though.

8843011,0,t3_51as26,I started with the ers looking to rebuild. I originally wanted to change to a spread option offense and  defense but personnel changes nixed that. Year  was very tough for the team struggling to a  season. But due to done good trades that netted very good draft picks I was able to begin a very quick rebuild. overall I selected Christian Hamlin a LOLB from Miami. He was an  overall with superstar development drafted. My other draft picks were all just as good. I selected   players and a  LE.Year  started poorly with new QB Dak Prescott. But after a  start the team won  of their last  only to miss the playoffs on a tiebreaker with Washington.The off season was boring. Well the opposite or boring actually. We brought in the top  free agents of the class with our  million in cap room.  overall Drew Brees  overall Desmond Trufant and  overall Odell Beckham Jr. It also just so happens those were my  biggest positions of need. In an effort to go all in I traded a young backup and paste round picks for Lane Johnson and Nick Mangold both of whom provided upgrades over the only two starting positions under  overall. Currently Ive simmed and played moments to a  record going into week .,Madden,d7asywi,2,t5_2rjpr

8882708,0,t3_51w3po,I did pretty much the same thing in my franchise but made some trades to shore up those positions. Mathis was getting killed on passing downs as a RG. I also think the only issue I see with your roster is why you would move Campbell to an NT.  The guy is such a good pass rusher that he is being wasted as a nose tackle.  The guy I signed for the Cardinals running that franchise is Terrance Cody because not only does he have  strength but he also has  block shedding which is great in the run game and he weighs around  or so IIRC.    Also I am not terribly worried about CB because Brandon Williams may not have the best coverage stats to start but the  speed out of the slot is very very valuable. I currently have Peterson Ramsey traded a ton for and Brandon Williams as my CB.  The only reason I know this is because Mathieu got hurt for  weeks and I wasnt going to bring Louis Delmas my backup FS down in the nickel.  I dont worry about Williams developing considering he is young.  He wont ever be a star unless he has a breakout year but he can be very solid.,Madden,d7fkqju,6,t5_2rjpr

If theyre level with each other and the CB hasnt turned his hips yet throw the ball. If your WR has a  in speed and theyre running side by side throw the ball. Dont wait for him to get more separation he already IS wide open.  If your WR a high release rating hes faster than the CB and theres no safety help  throw the ball as soon as your WR beats the press. Choose your matchups wisely.  If your WR is significantly taller or has a high CIT rating hell probably come down with the ball in a v situation  Put your Perrimans and Desean Jacksons on your opponents slowest CBs.  Put your highest release guys on the weakest press corners Learn route concepts. There are route concepts that are designed to get players open deep.

Chase was a very balanced QB having really good all around stats while Jimmy was more of a pocket passer which didnt really quite fit with our West Coast bootleg filled offense. At the end of the preseason Chase won the starting job and we looked to start stronger than  where we skid into a  game losing streak before going  in our last  games. We ended up losing Week  to a hot Oakland team who lost in the AFCG last year  and Chase looked amazing. We went on to win  straight including a blowout at Jerry World where we cemented ourselves on top of the division. We then dropped the game after that a battle in Mile High against the Broncos.Week  was a disaster. A trap game if you will at the  Kansas City Chiefs. They ended up hurting Chase Graham with a broken thumb ended Alfred Morriss season with a torn ACL and Pierre Garcon had a concussion. We lost in overtime  and we struggled to get anything out of our offense as we lost  straight falling to  and barely holding onto the division. The Barons front office snapped and we traded a rd round pick to Houston for one Mr. Matt Forte. Chase was back for a SNF matchup against the New York Giants where we won  on a last second fieldgoal and then the next week we blew out the Eagles in Brooklyn. This was the end of our reign of terror as Chase was hurt yet again during a  game in Seattle where we lost . We won our division at  with the Cowboys and Giants right behind us also at  and oh yeah WE STILL DONT HAVE CHASE GRAHAM BACKIn the Wildcard round we defeated the Cowboys in Brooklyn  but the score looks closer than it actually was. The Cowboys rookie QB Jeffery Langford made our defense look like the  Bears as we racked up  Sacks and  picks one of them a Pick. We then head on into the rainy Seattle to take on the nd seed Seahawks. We slowed the game down to our tempo and set up shop with an amazing first half by Matt Forte who gathered  rushing yards. We were up  going into the rd quarter where we scored one last time before Russel Wilson tried to pull his NotBlackEnough Magic but it was too little too late. The Barons won  to book a ticket to the Tundra of Lambeau.We held the  Packers to  yards in the first half where we took a commanding  point lead. The second half was very interesting as Aaron Rodgers MVP rallied his team to score  straight points to take a  point lead but after Aaron was sacked in his own endzone the Barons rallied for a fourth quarter comeback. Brooklyn won .Superbowl  was the matchup everyone was confused about. The  Barons who dethroned Rodgers and Wilson back to back with a backup QB and the  Chargers who were on their last straw to win Felipe Rios his well deserved ring. No one knew who was starting at quarterback for the Barons as Chase Graham was finally healthy again but Garoppolo lead the team on a game winning drive in Green Bay two weeks before. The team decided that rookie QB Chase Graham would start under center in Arlington Texas for the Superbowl. The game was close for a long time  Barons but the th quarter was terrible for Mr. Rivers.  interceptions two of them leading for touchdowns. The Barons win big  and Philip Rivers goes out of the NFL not with a bang but a whimper.TLDR Washington moved to Brooklyn we sucked for a little bit drafted QB Chase Graham went on a huge  tear. Lost Chase Graham to injury Garoppolo stepped up we went  and got a wildcard round. We beat down Dallas hardcore we barely held onto a lead in Seattle and we went on a th quarter comeback down  in Lambeau to go to the Superbowl where we ended Philip Rivers dreams of a Superbowl win.,Madden,d91vauw,2,t5_2rjpr

10405471,0,t1_dcmhifl,I use the same strategy but I like to user the DL. It put pressure on the QB in base defense which makes him dump it off out of bounds or not so perfect situations. I think the key to it working is it makes CPUs think its doing well by going  for yds in the run game. I do user the LB when its the red zone though because I find he very rarely throws in the user area and its a large chunk of the field.

Im totally sorry for the late response ended up not getting on anything for a couple days.I ended up sorta doing what you said when your recommended the first option. Drafted those two I mentioned along with one younger stud later on and a couple older vets to replace in the regular draft. FredMartin are the cornerstones of my oline then Ill eventually replace each of the two vets through the draft. I have a few other positions on my team that I late drafted  yr old vets that I plan on replacing through the draft. I have some really young QBs in Jacoby Brissett and Brett Hundley that Im supplementing with an immediately top oline and RB then possibly filling that QB position and other wholes through regular draft.

11248715,0,t3_60jjf7,Edgevoice on Operation Sports posted this as a basis at least on how to use the Gameplan Playcall feature...all I would add to it would be once you have set your plays per the ratings then include a variety of fun plays for you to use rather than delete plays not in your gameplan.  How To Utilize Gameplan Playcalling FeatureWhile nowhere near as well designed compared to past generations of Madden using the gameplan featureas a means to call plays is still possible in Madden . Although this feature is severely limiting regarding what you are able to do if properly utilized not only will it make it easier for you to call your plays youll find yourself becoming a better play caller based on the situation.The first step youll need to take is to build an offensive custom playbook. Everyone has their own tastes but I would highly advise that you try to stay as balanced as possible. Writing your playbook to a simple word pad file will allow you to keep track of how many runs short medium deep passes and nickel packages you are installing. At this time do not select gameplan situations for any plays you add. When you have finished save your playbook and name it core offense.In order to start building your gameplan start by simply selecting edit core offense. You would then select  plays you absolutely want to show up for each situation. This is done by awarding  plays  stars  plays . stars and finally  plays  stars. Continue to do this throughout every situation or copy and paste situations. Of note rd amp th down medium situations only allow for  selections. Make sure you are picking plays from every formation in your playbook or that formation may not show up in game.I set up my situations as follows ST DOWN  GRIND CLOCK  ND amp MEDIUM  LONG  ND amp SHORT  RDTH amp SHORT  INSIDE   GOAL LINE  RDTH amp MEDIUM  RDTH amp LONG   MINUTE  RED ZONE. When you have finished save this playbook as do not overwrite core offense playbook and name it as you wish. The plays you selected will show up under the Frequently Called play box.If you want to further enhance this feature reload your gameplanned playbook and select or copy  additional plays for each desired situation. These plays would be awarded a star rating of .  and . respectively. While these plays will not show up under frequent called they will randomly rotate under the Strategy Pick window. What I did was simply copy nd and short to both st and  and nd and mediumlong. This will give you a few more options. Lastly I would strongly advise you to delete all plays from your gameplanned playbook that you have not added to your gameplan. That way if hit with the  minute offense playcall bug it will be easier to find the play you want in your formation playcall screen.In the future I hope EA fully implements the playcall gameplan feature as it had done so well in previous versions. Being that the Game Plan feature was extremely hyped I was hoping that this area had been fully addressed. There are  available playcall windows. It flies in the face of all logic to not be able to assign more plays into a gameplan window than . Having said that having at least  picks for almost every situation and the use of formation substitutions is a way for users to avoid clumsily formation fumbling through their playbook while trying to find what it is that they want to call. Ive been watching football for over  years and have yet to see and offensive coordinator standing on the sidelines holding his entire playbook.,Madden,df70x4d,4,t5_2rjpr
