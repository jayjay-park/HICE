She was a stray her whole life presumably and must be rationed food or she will gorge. She used to throw up all the time from what we assumed was overeating and a week stomach. One day though we ran out of dry food and gave her some wet canned food and she didnt throw up the whole day. Since then we have fed her wet food and she very rarely throws up. It is just a suggestion and you might already give her wet food. I just thought Id let you know what worked for us.,BeforeNAfterAdoption,cp7arjg,3,t5_35qtc

It almost seemed like she was afraid everything was going to disappear. Have you had the cat his whole life? Its possible he was abused and cant shake the memory of it. If its been  years and hes still so anxious Id say definitely talk to a vet about putting him on something.

My motherinlaw was still coming by to put food out for the neighborhood cats that come and go. The little black one stayed and when we came back he ran to us like he loved us all along so we made sure it was okay to take him with us and so we did.

5840713,0,t3_3v8boq,Full StoryMy friend works at a school and her classroom just got a betta fish. Unfortunately its health seemed to be declining and the current from the classrooms tank filter seemed to be tossing it around everwhere. The teacher who obtained the fish decided to euthanize the betta rather than showing the kids a slowly dying and suffering fish. My friend objected ended up rescuing the fish and took it home.Unfortunately her idea of taking care of it was putting it in a . gallon tank with marbles and a single plastic plant decoration. She also lives in a terribly uninsulated house and to save money wont turn on the heat so it is freezing in her home. She posted on Instagram and just to note... bettas are rarely ever that color.. despite the filter.I urged her to buy at least a gallon with a heater. Saying that betta requires at least a heater if youre not going to warm your own house up. Plus even if you dont believe that fish dont require space the water will dirty up faster and thatll kill the fish with the ammonia buildup. But she insisted that she cant cause she has no money for it. Then she asked if I wanted to take it cause I cared about it more. I hesitated too since I didnt have a job let alone funds to buy a bigger tank with decorations and a heater. But I couldnt just leave the fish to die so against my better judgement I took it.Renamed him Blue cause he had a blue streak on his side like the alpha raptor in Jurrassic World. I sought out advice from rbettafish  they told me what I needed since I never owned a pet before. He couldnt even eat properly he kept chewing the pellets and spat it out. I had to pick it up a straw and have it float around before he finally swallowed it. About a day into his improved conditions he ate so heartily. Fast foward a month and now here he is. Fins are healing up swimming around more actively and eating voraciously.,BeforeNAfterAdoption,cxl8t4m,132,t5_35qtc

Her spine and ribs were sticking out her coat was rough and she was missing fur here and there from malnutrition.  Also some open sores had to have some bad teeth pulled and she has about half of a tail.And shes ridiculously friendly.  Walked right into my hand and started purring the first time I saw her.  I petted her for only a minute before I picked her up.  She loved being picked up.  Then I took her inside and that was that.She ate two . oz. cans of wet food every day and crunchies.  Then my parents fell hard for her and she lives with them now.  She hasnt seen an empty dish for over five years however she gets into the trash if she can.  She also tears open bags of food even when the bag is next to a full dish of food.  She is still insecure about food.She is still amazingly warm and friendly and visits all of the neighbors.  Which is fine the neighbors love her.  Several neighbors have small children who just adore her.  So the calico gets all sorts of handouts and treats.

10946248,0,t3_5wagc3,So lovely. I remember when we got my two home rescues not abused but had a shaky start in life. I opened their carriers and they both peeked outside and immediately shot underneath the sofa. Anticipating that this could happen I left some water on one side of the sofa and some food on the other side with a litter tray they already knew to use the litter tray within site for them. Over the next few hours they would pop a nose out then go back and hide. Then they got hungry and ate the food had a little drink. I put more food out but a bit further away and kept repeating until they felt comfortable enough to come out and explore their new home. Over the next few days they gradually explored the living room but kept going back under the sofa. Eventually Lara found the courage to come up to me for some attention and when she started purring her brother came over very cautiously. Once they both felt comfortable enough to come up to me they stopped sleeping under the sofa and started to interact with my parents as well. Been awesome cats ever since. Still just as cute as ever. ,BeforeNAfterAdoption,de910rt,11,t5_35qtc

11406272,0,t1_dfo055x,Its hard to say because I find that their energy levels vary but my pit has been the perfect match for me! River is a great combination of a couch potato and an energetic dog thats always up for a hike. I find there to be certain qualities in pits that are tough to find in another breed they have wonderful dispositions with people and the cuddles are AMAZING. I will say that they can be iffy with other dogs but with proper socialization its entirely possible for them to be dog friendly. Plus if you adopt one they will be eternally grateful!,BeforeNAfterAdoption,dfovxh2,3,t5_35qtc
