7296447,0,t3_4fc1w0,Often new lets players dont want to collaborate and work together. Some have the kind of mindset where for you to succeed others need to fail. Whilst its stupid some people think like that and since this is a relatively small subreddit its easier for malicious people to make an impact.I wouldnt worry about it since the majority of us just want to help each other and those who are dedicated to helping out will watch your stuff and enjoy it.,LetsPlayVideos,d27k1hf,4,t5_2yvbo
