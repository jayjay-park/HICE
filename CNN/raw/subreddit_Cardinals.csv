87009,0,t1_ceo94ro,I really hope youre not right but you definitely pointed to one of my fears.  Wainwright was a pack mule for innings last year.  I hope he doesnt regress but that many innings on a  year old with a rebuilt ligament in his arm worries me.  As for Miller I thought it was obvious they set a limit on him with how little he was used in the postseason.  I dont think hell have a drop off at all.  I think and hope hell improve past his stellar rookie season.,Cardinals,ceoc2jd,5,t5_2r7tu

476559,0,t3_1zjbb0,Cool idea. I like looking at the whiff rates for the three different types of pitches and then comparing them to the league average to make a zscore. After that I think the metric is kind of pointless. Yes its useful to know if a batter is more vulnerable to a certain type of pitch but to say Yadi is more attackable because he is . standard deviations BELOW the whiff rate for offspeed pitches as compared to just just . SDs BELOW on fastballs is wrong in my mind. Yes I agree that from this information you would want to attack Yadi via the fastball seeing that he whiffs more compared to himself and not the league but to say he is the second most attackable on the team seems wrong to me. Maybe Im just hung up on the name. But like I said I like the first part of the metric. I fail to see the usefulness of the actual attackability score.,Cardinals,cfufrbx,1,t5_2r7tu

1056655,0,t1_cho7sh5,Molina is our best batter. Thats why he should be hitting higher. Peralta is on a hot streak and I dont trust the things Adams has done so far.WL record can be affected by so much more than one player it isnt worth mentioning at all especially over so few games. SLG doesnt matter because it can be artificially elevated by a high average high BABIP exactly like Adams is. For the record Peralta has a . ISO to Adams .. Which is a huge gap in power.So we have two players that are better hitters than Adams batting lower than him in the order. All that excluding the perfectly rational expectation that he will crash hard quite soon.Edit look man I really dont want to argue this for the next  months so can we just leave it at I have an irrational dislike of Adams?

Waino was one of two setup guys for most of that regular season and was only shifted to closer right around the time we entered the playoffs.

Im under the belief that while the Cardinals are struggling to produce offense establishing some consistency as far as playing time goes for the young guys will be instrumental in fixing the issue for the stretch run. My complaint is that they should have gone after another big time pitcher. Lackey is cool but Justin Masterson is not that good IMO. ,Cardinals,cjhp5ig,1,t5_2r7tu

Price could push for an  year contract in free agency into his age  season if he really wanted to which means he may ask for a lot with an extension.  So out of all of our top pitching options only one of them gets us a pitcher who we wont be paying to pitch when hes more than likely well past his prime.  So the question is if were looking to pick a top starter for the next  years to help us win should we get exactly who we want or should we try to save a little on the prospectmoney side?

3163917,0,t3_2wd2jf,I just dont get why the Phillies think a guy like that has so much value.  Pass.  We dont ever go out and sign big name pitchers. Why trade for one that costs the same? Plus you dont want the last years of a big contract.  You want the first years the ones the Phillies already got.  In baseball dollars Hamels might be worth  million a year.  But thats what hes worth not that plus giving up what may well be our best starter out of all the young guys.  Just go out and sign Zimmerman or Price next year if your dying to buy your next ace.  We can get buy with what we have this year barring major injuries. ,Cardinals,copxt2l,5,t5_2r7tu

I think when girls are given the same opportunity to grow up with the same level of training as boys throughout their lifetimes we will see a shift in what womens bodies are capable of achieving. I dont think the majority or even a similar percentage of players will be women but I think there will be women. I dont see it happening for at least another  years though because it has to start at the tee ball level. There just arent enough girls playing boys tee ball or little league because its either not allowed or socially unacceptable. ,Cardinals,cqwbwiy,2,t5_2r7tu

Ive been on the field in heated and disappointing moments myself.  I understand.But this sub is getting out of hand.I aint your dad though Id swear under oath that at least a dozen of yall need to quit drinking so damned much... and this aint my subreddit any more than anyone elses but the salt has gotta cut back.All of this fuck the umps business is bush league.  We look like petulant children especially because  of the time this season the umps havent been wrong.  They go out to do a good job every damn night just like the players do.  Theres a very good reason the season is as long as it is because it averages out all the chaff and leaves only the wheat.  Everything goes around and comes around in equal portions and in the grand scheme what is this all really worth?  Not a whole lot to us who just watch at home.Its not worth looking so bad for.  We literally sound like were one bad call away from throwing batteries and beer bottles at the field.  Personally I know we all like to cut loose online but look back at your comment history tonight.  How much of that is really you?  And if the answer is not much maybe you should think about why that is.  Were adults here and we can damn well act like it.

5337750,0,t1_cvtqwbh,I never asked to be part of the absurd and self crowned best fans in baseball grouping. These are my feelings. Im free to have them and stating that I may hate the cubs more than I love the Cards was just being hyperbolic. I live in the midwest but not in the STL or Chicago area so the typical fan that is in your area will surely be different but when I try to discuss baseball with the typical cub fan here they are extremely unknowledgeable of not only the game in general but the cubs themselves. Head to toe in cub gear cubbies this and cubbies that I LOVE the cubbies... Whos their shortstop? Ummmm... uhh... Center fielder? Manager? Anyone? Who do you think is gonna win the Cy Young this season? the wut? I realize my feelings arent directly team related but mostly fan related and by extension I hate the team. They have the worst sort of bandwagon fan. Fans that feed on the failure. Much like the Red Sox had before the the divine intervention of  where people were fans due to the consistent mediocrity. Yes the Cards surely have gained a number of tag alongs over the past decade but why not? Its been great baseball. Why would you tag along if a team was just utterly garbage for decades? What incentive are you giving the owners to put quality on the field when you still show up for bad teams and still buy their merchandise and beer? Not to mention the medias infatuation with the cubs. To hear Sports Center youd think it was the cubs that won  games and won the Central. Again. You can all down vote and pretend you have some sort of moral superiority and when we start fielding teams like we had in the s Ill still be here loving the Cards and hating the cubs.

However acquiring a half decent  era type guy before the trade deadline would have solved this with minimal cost in prospects or wins.  Ideally he only needed to remove  or  starts and potentially pull them an inning or two sooner a few times and they are in great shape to end up at  innings pitched even if we go all the way to the World Series.

5890390,0,t1_cxrpy8p,Haha true I just always like looking for an excuse to use that gif.Between the two though...Id say a bat. We need power and weve already demonstrated thats something we lack. Our bullpen and rotation while a little faltering in losing Lynn for the season and Lackey to the Cubs will be back with Wainwright and hopefully a healthy GarciaMartinez punch with Cooney and Lyons already with some experience and Reyes on the backburner. A bat is something we need. Someone who has power and can be consistent...we missed that last season and it showed.Holliday is old Grichuk and Piscotty still young and the rest of the guys...while talented lack consistency. We need someone to pull it all together in my opinion. But if we walk away with nothing...I still think this will be a great team. But a good signing will give us a nice edge over the now powerful Cubs and PiratesEdit  Cant believe I forgot about WachaWachaWacha...,Cardinals,cxrriwj,1,t5_2r7tu

5907014,0,t3_3w47u1, gtConsidering this is the first time I have done this exercise I unfortunately do not have a baseline but on the surface  seems pretty high.I decided this was pretty lazy analysis and wanted to try and find out if  really is high and whether it matters.  Unfortunately what I found is that Cooneys number isnt  and even if it was it might not mean anything.There is a glitch in the Brooks data such that in one game the data for Cooney is missing some pitches and includes some pitches that were actually thrown by Tyson Ross.  This happens occasionally when theres a problem in the data files that Brooks processes which is subsequently fixed but sometimes not reparsed.  Ive found examples before and flagged them with Dan Brooks and have done so with this one.  Unfortunately because of the small sample of  starts its enough to shift the outcome for Cooney from outlier to typical.  The Brooks data also includes some adjustments that attempt to correct for errors in the Pitch FX setup and while I wouldnt expect that to change the results on a large sample it does so slightly for Cooney.  The end result is that I think the correct cumber for Cooney excluding his April start is . on raw Pitch FX data or  . on Brooks data without the glitch.As for whether the number is high and if it is whether it matters I was initially going to just look at other Cards starters.  Then I decided to add the Royals starters in case there was a difference in organisational philosophies.  Then I decided to do the top  and bottom  from guys who qualified for the ERA title and finally I decided to include a bunch of guys who made a similar number of starts to Cooney just to see if the small sample size gave a wider spread.   All results are from raw Pitch FX data mainly because its easier to retrieve than the Brooks data.  Results are below.Pitcher|Same|Different| Different|||Cardinals|||Carlos Martinez|||.Jaime Garcia|||.John Lackey|||.Lance Lynn|||.Michael Wacha|||.|||.|||Royals|||Chris Young|||.Danny Duffy|||.Edinson Volquez|||.Jeremy Guthrie|||.Yordano Ventura|||.|||.|||ERA Leaders|||Zack Greinke|||.Jake Arrieta|||.Clayton Kershaw|||.David Price|||.Dallas Keuchel|||.Jacob deGrom|||.Gerrit Cole|||.Matt Harvey|||.Sonny Gray|||.John Lackey|||.Max Scherzer|||.Madison Bumgarner|||.Carlos Martinez|||.Shelby Miller|||.Lance Lynn|||.|||.|||ERA Trailers|||Taijuan Walker|||.Colby Lewis|||.Rubby De La Rosa|||.John Danks|||.CC Sabathia|||.Aaron Harang|||.Rick Porcello|||.Jeff Samardzija|||.Chris Tillman|||.Alfredo Simon|||.|||.||| starts|||Alec Asher|||.Ariel Pena|||.Brandon Morrow|||.Chad Billingsley|||.Colin Rea|||.David Holmberg|||.Dillon Gee|||.Erik Johnson|||.Josh Smith|||.Kevin Correia|||.Manny Banuelos|||.Nick Tropeano|||.Randy Wolf|||.Ryan Weber|||.Sean Nolin|||.Severino Gonzalez|||.Shaun Marcum|||.Steven Matz|||.Tim Cooney|||.Tsuyoshi Wada|||.Tyler Matzek|||.Zach Davies|||.Zack Godley|||.|||.The biggest surprise for me is that there is no difference between the ERA champs and the ERA chumps.    The first set includes David Price at . but also Dallas Keuchel at . and the two sets have the same average.  The list of spot starers does have a wider spread as expected due to sample size and also a slightly lower average.TLDR  Cooneys quadrantchanging percentage wasnt actually ..  After eliminating a data glitch it was between . and . depending on your preferred data source.  If it had been . that would be higher than average but its not clear that a high percentage translates to greater success.,Cardinals,cxtxxwr,2,t5_2r7tu

6519868,0,t1_cztp00d,I would like to see Piscotty hit lead off if he can maintain his high OBP. His numbers make him intriguing for hitting second but as a non traditional lead off hitter I think Id like him there. I feel the same about batting Wong th because hed be like a second lead off hitter with a lower OBP but like you said  no way Mike goes for that. If were talking line ups I dont really want to see Holliday in the  hole anymore. I love Matt his bat is still very useful but unless he can get his slugging percentage back up to  numbers I dont think he fits the bill for hitting rd anymore. Again this is something I dont think Mike will do but Holliday would be a good th or th hitter right now. My ideal line up as our roster stands today and assuming Marp doesnt bat lead off anymore would be Piscotty Grichuck Marp AdamsMoss whoever wins the spot or the duo Holliday Peralta Molina Wong Pitcher.,Cardinals,cztpekc,2,t5_2r7tu

6522214,0,t3_44ytw7,Matheny needs to find consistency in Yadis days off.  His process is to promise to give them days off wait until they get hurt or perform poorly realize he fucked up and give them lots of rest in a short period of time.  Then hell change his mind and stop resting them when the team performs poorly without them.Enough of that bs.  Yadi was injured for the last few weeks of the season yet still caught the most innings in the NL.... by  fucking innings over  full games worth.  This is obviously so fucking obviously not sustainable.  Please get it right this year Matheny we cant win the postseason with an injured club division win or no.  I dont care if he does it by starting Pena for Leake or if its random.  It just needs to be consistent I dont care if Yadi gives you puppy dog eyes and says he wants to play tell him no.,Cardinals,czty5li,3,t5_2r7tu

7600049,0,t1_d362tz1,Sorry about your hogs  Im a city boy through and through but my dad raised both steers and hogs for H growing up in SoCal it was a lot more agricultural and Midwestern back then! Im  and other than  all Ive known is a pretty embarrassing to occasionally great team that never really worked together like we finally are now. Im a little unfamiliar with what you might mean by failed trades and I know your offseason didnt go ideally but I personally as a strategic thinker on how we can best keep beating you  think you all are going to be just fine  look at how Diaz and Hazlebaker are working out. As for the free agents I think Mozeliak just knows his limits and didnt overpay. Our front office used to sign splashy free agents piecemeal  it doesnt always work and rarely does. Look at the Dbacks this year for example. Were so lucky to have a competent one now. No Mos one of the sharpest in the game plus your run differential stats have you underperforming. I think the Cards are going to overtake the Pirates and make a run at us for the Division and Id bet money on you reaching the playoffs in a WC spot at least. The Pirates just have too much of a fear complex or bad headspace with the Cubs nowadays I think to really make a run at us whereas you all are tied with them but still underperforming. and I dont care about your record I am always watching you guys. I mean rivalries are born out of respect I will always twitch at the sight of red. Even if we get a WS ring you have a lot and not to diminish what an accomplishment that will be  it certainly wont signal the an end to the dynasty immediately. ,Cardinals,d3635n1,1,t5_2r7tu

There was a lot of panic in the Swiss watch community  years ago when the quartz watch was all the rage quartz movements use batteries invented by Seiko but they weathered that storm. I doubt it is dying now. Wealthy people still see a luxury watch as a necessary statement about their status.Automatic watches arent going to get any cheaper but there is little chance of the big brands like Omega or Rolex going anywhere any time soon. Probably fewer people that can build them though so maybe become a watchmaker if you want to make good reliable money. ,Cardinals,d5o95dy,2,t5_2r7tu

Rosie started this season with one of the highest save percentages in the league.  He was and could potentially be again one of the most dominant closers in the game.  Confirmation bias just hits harder with him because of how you feel about his pitching not because of reality or his situations.If Oh had picked up  blown saves without giving up a single earned run then I might entertain this argument but no.

11558067,0,t3_64z7l0,I thought this was a really interesting look at a midgame adjustment that Waino made. An abbreviated set of chunks from the articlegt I dont remember ever seeing a pitcher switch sides of the rubber in the middle of a game and I definitely dont remember anyone doing it only against left or righthanded hitters. When Jayson Werth and Ryan Zimmerman batted between Murphy and Drew Wainwright was back on the firstbase side. It seems like a desperate even crazy thing to do. It didnt really work either.gtWe got a very limited sample of this radical ingame adjustment and pretty uneven results. The fact that it needed to happen and that Wainwright a notoriously stubborn proud veteran hurler recognized midstream that it needed to happen can only be viewed as a very bad sign. He did this in the middle of the fourth inning itself dont forget. Hed been in his usual spot earlier in the same frame against Wieters and then Eaton. Its a panic move and it didnt even pay substantial dividends.gtOn the other hand it did look better. Wainwright didnt look totally comfortable working that way and still he made his best pitches of the night to lefties from that position.,Cardinals,dg640e3,3,t5_2r7tu
