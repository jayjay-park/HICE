I didnt think of jealous taters downvoting so maybe commenting is a better way to handle these posts. Regardless the main point of me saying downvote and move on was because he seemed pretty damn angry and I would rather him not give the OP the time of day. And if he was going to  give him the time of day he should have a good argument aka not making ridiculous claims like k when there are better ways to shut this down.I certainly see the validity to wellcrafted comments. Outlandish comments in an argument make the rest of your claim appear flawed to your opposition.
