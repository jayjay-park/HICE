6923665,0,t3_4aiqtc,Upon reviewing your channel I realized you were the reddit user ukyotosomo who was caught freebooting other peoples content and was unapologetic when he was called out for it.  Your exact words were I dont care I got subscribers for it.  You then followed this by a string of insults towards the people who cared saying that they had no life and should get over it but I digress.  The following is a critique of why this mentality of stealing fake subscribers with stolen content is wrong for building a channel beyond the fact that stealing content from other YouTubers is a shameful act in itself that could rightfully get your channel taken down some day.Looking at your channel I can see you have  subscribers but no one is watching any of your videos.  You barely get  views on most videos and you should be getting about one or two thousand if your subscribers were interested in your content.  As can be seen your most popular videos those that were stolen from others have nothing to do with the rest of your channel or the content you actually produce so all the subscribers you stole alone with those videos do not care about your content.  This means you effectively have a couple hundred subscribers that actually care combined with a bunch of people that couldnt care less.I suggest you start your channel over.  First I believe you already have one strike against you and you will most likely get many more with all the stolen videos that you continue to freeboot and still remain on your channel.  Beyond that your subscribers dont care about the content you actually make and most of them thumbs down all your new videos because they dislike your channel.  You have a hugely disproportionate amount of dislikes on your channel because of this.You will be better off starting from scratch and building an honest audience of people that actually care about your content rather than relying on stealing views by freebooting other YouTubers videos and absorbing fake subscribers that will thumbs down all your new content because its not what they signed up for.,channelsharing,d114e5e,1,t5_3d5qi
