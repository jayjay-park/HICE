256214,0,t3_1wwjln,I paid for three weekends of reading classes my freshman year two years ago and after I was done the flyers for the seminars started showing up. I was sitting in my Macroeconomics class and a couple of guys that had been to the free seminars started talking about it and they were talking about the exact stuff that I had paid  to learn.I imagine that this is the seminar youre talking about. You should go I was able to start reading faster but its stuff that you really have to stick with if you want to see any significant change. Definitely dont pay for anything though Im sure the internet can show you the same tricks.,sooners,cf7b94e,2,t5_2r5kj

It would seem  on the SAT would be about a  on the ACT which would make you pretty solid to get in. If you keep your GPA where it is and do that well on the SAT you will be fine. On a side note why the SAT and not the ACT? The ACT is the more popular choice both nation wide and in Oklahoma. ,sooners,cmvwi8n,0,t5_2r5kj
