4983922,0,t1_cum8hm5,Romance is really fast paced as in a roller coaster ride of emotions in one chapter. Thats all I can compare maybe it is due to me being an editor for this series I just cant compare the two.I will say that Kuang Shens combat is focused primarily on the MC not a team like with the Shreck Seven Devils. And when it does focus on Group combat it is on a large scale. Ex. sieges and armies of three different nations. Additionally the chapter length is similar to DD and the series improves as you read on. The first two volumes are not so great but if you can get past them the characters along with the story line improve into a readable and generally well written story. ,noveltranslations,cumqx0p,1,t5_39owk

Then when one of the girls disrupted his mana during a competition which opened a hole for his massive internal mana to escape causing MC and two others got teleported to another world... and then I think the writer dropped it.  Reading your first chapter over you tend to name the speaker or set the tone after each line of conversation even when the speaker changes which is the most jarring part. For a straightforward story like this its not a huge issue to understanding whats going on but the flow is not good. I prefer if you name the speaker and set the tone before someone says something but for dramatic effect you can do what you normally do with the dialogue. Its a little annoying to read dialogue then afterward understand how its supposed to be read then have to reread it because I wasnt paying attention as I read.

Dont expect any rhyme or reason here. OrgtFollow the hijinks of an actually mentally handicapped person who skipped the whole growing up and learning about the world and common sense phase most people go through. He is taken care of by his slaves. Those slaves are children and also sometimes very stupid for comical reasons. To balance out his retardation the MC has the superpower to gain incredible skill through brainless repetition of related acts. Through this the MC has so far gained an unimaginably huge amount of magic power a legendary healing skill and through repeatedly cutting four stationary objects an autopilot for fights. Also pain resistance because he was cutting himself.The only significant thing I would add is that apparantly everyone has that superpower.

In this case we actually have MC who it makes sense for girls to fall for and we have some girls that arent just checking off the boxes. Ning er is my favorite but Zi Yun is a odd princess type character who is starting to become a bit more warming so thats nice. Honestly I think a dual lover situation would work out here quite well. Of course it would take a ton of time to build and would require a lot of effort be placed on developing the girls characters to allow such a thing.,noveltranslations,cw11onj,3,t5_39owk

5435046,1,t3_3phfgo,I dont mind people MTLing that is your choice after all but I dont agree with opening up a website and making it public on this subreddit for various reasons.One reason being that this subreddit is supposed to be for actual translators who do speak the language and have gotten permission to do translations of the works from the author himher self. Have you asked for permission to profit as little as it may be off of doing the author an injustice by providing an illegitimate translation for the novel? Another reason being the fact that it is doing a disservice to the translators themselves for all of the hard work that they put into each translation. You are indirectly pushing people to read these MTL and by doing so may make them lose potential readers in the long run which in turn may make some translators slow down or ultimately stop.It is also giving no face to the author. I have never looked at MTL but I can only guess how bad it would be after studying two foreign languages myself. Someone posted that it is like skimming through a chapter and that you are not actually reading it as a result. So my question would be is why not just make a spoiler thread to be spoiled about the future instead? There are plenty of forum threads out there that may have even full spoilers like Doulou Dalu.I wont continue to go on about the injustice of trying to make MTL a mainstream thing but I would like to not see such things in the form of new threads on the subreddit. I am fine with people asking about it through replies mails or even just asking for help to get started on MTL but I would not like to see batches of MTL being posted each day by new people even if you do put a lot of work into it. Whether or not people agree with my points is up to themselves.,noveltranslations,cw6dr1z,-4,t5_39owk

Giving face to the author? the author didnt even intend for their work to be translated in english. fantranslators also didnt get permission from the author thats the same thing as saying that scanlation and fansubbing got the permission from whoever.

5460629,0,t1_cw9lrqj,I personally didnt mind the MTL. I think however void went about doing it managed to make things a lot less choppy than most other MTL I have come across and I dont think my understanding of what is happening in the story has really been negatively impacted because of it.If you are seriously considering translating Xian Ni I would suggest looking at the translated version yourself and see what you think of it. If you think the overall sentence structures are alright but maybe special cultivation techniqueitemother names are wrong you could always do something like talk with void and see if he would be willing to let you go through and replace them with what you think they should be. Doing it might be a bit of a pain but overall I believe it would be a lot less work than doing the entire story over from the beginning.This is just what I as someone who thinks the MTL overall is fine thinks. If you were to start over from the beginning I would probably wait until you got back to the current chapter then do a reread with your version or something. I cant speak for the rest of the community but from what Ive seen it seems like a lot of people dont bother going back and rereading chapters that are retranslated when there are already a large amount previously done.Maybe Im wrong about all that though. If you do decide you want to pick up Xian Ni I would suggest making a post dedicated entirely to that and asking about others opinions as to where you should start. In the end though do what you want. The last thing any of us here would want to happen is you picking up where the MTL left off and not enjoying what youre doing because of that. Just find a novel you truly enjoy and translate that for us. If you enjoy it there are bound to be others here who do as well.,noveltranslations,cw9nb1e,1,t5_39owk

The author clearly implies that he was not a hermit in his many years of travel and I have no doubt he made friends throughout the hundred years he lived.Emotional maturity isnt always directly related to age.  Mental or otherwise.  There are people in the real world that go through a traumatic experience and wind up stuck at a lower level emotionally than their real age.  Having everyone he cares about killed may have done that to him.  Or maybe its one of his elaborate schemes.  Who knows.  Maybe he is a bigger troll than the Mc from Long Live Summons. Either way its funny.As for Nie Li being an antisocial hermit.  I have not read ahead but from the spoilers Ive seen he certainly qualifies as one.

5784188,0,t1_cxdtqef,That is a good thing you guys did giving up when you couldnt continue and thanks for translating what you did. However Id definitely disagree with you on quality over quantity especially something like Ze Tian Ji. If the quality is not sufficient then no matter how many chapters you release a day it would be a lot worse than one chapter a day at good quality. There is however a limit to quality as if you grasp the authors meaning and present all of it in an understandable way you cant get much better. If you have a very large team there is no theoretical limit to quantity until you catch up to the current raw.,noveltranslations,cxe30uw,2,t5_39owk

Unlike Chu Feng and the others at least there was offence of having their family killed directly by the other party. But I mean kill others just for some little offense like not showing respect is still shitty.So my point is that Linley is not better than everyone else.

I want that to be for the MC though as well. Why does a MC sacrifice himself for others and why does he protect the weak? There has to be a sound reasoning with understanding of the surroundings as well as the psyche. The characters cant just do random shit with reasons like  because it is right ! or  because it is good ! with no actual reasoning or background. This goes for antagonists protagonists and side characters. So just as much as I get annoyed with shitty villains I get as annoyed with shitty MCs.

He hasnt worked out how to change his Destiny and his Destiny is to die when he turns  which is both protecting him and also hanging like a curse over his head.He thought he was risking  years to gain  but in reality he has changed absolutely nothing about his circumstances yet and couldnt die now because he is not fated too. He could possibly have put himself into a coma until he turned  though. PWhich he already knows but perhaps subconsciously is still fighting the concept  the whole reason he needed to purify is so that he can win the Great Contest. The whole reason he wants to win the Great Contest is that first place wins access to a LibraryVaultMausoleum which contains something that his master has said will allow him to fight Fate. Purifying is actually fairly irrelevant to the story  its just a minor milestone for the MC on their way to achieve their goals.

You think Fen Juecheng would be like ok this guy who is much weaker than me and crashed my wedding I will listen calmly to what he says and then argue with him like sophisticated people? Did you forget the start where he was arguing with the Xiao sect and even though he won logically he still got kicked out because he is weak? By negotiating you are putting your loved ones in danger because when you become weak they can simply renegade on the deal and kill you and your family if they dont fear you. In this setting negotiatingtalkingpleading when you are weak is useless because the strong do whatever they want.

6479354,0,t1_czpgufn,Well I think part of that is China is fairly huge and massively populated but its hard to have similar scale cities without highrise apartments and other high density housing not in line with fantasy works. So how do you make a fantasy world seem larger in scale than our own world? Exaggeration. Massive cities require massive infrastructure. How do these cities of millions of people in Medieval or Renaissance levels of technology even feed their populations? Do they use magic for freezing perishable goods? How do they transport goods in the city? I think Edo was the worlds largest city during the Renaissance at about  people and it needed a highly feudalistic society with a strongly centralised government drawing in massive amounts of tribute from the outlying farming provinces to maintain that population.I could go on  but you get the point. They want their story to be more epic than the real world so make it bigger but then run into the problem of readers struggling to suspend their disbelief as they ignore the physical constraints that environment would have in it.,noveltranslations,czpigws,3,t5_39owk

Plus they are all evil doerswhich is the wording CN novels use to refer to people that can fight people above their level which is why they are hunted where ever they may be.But sure just because they have evil within them doesnt mean they are evil.

6842007,0,t1_d0rsu2j,Yeah but theres a difference between what the cautious CN protagonist like Meng Hao represents and what most of the cautious JP protags represent.The cautious CN protag could better be described as crafty or cunning. They arent cautious in order to deconstruct the trope of the hero as an extraordinary person theyre cautious because it plays into a different sort of heroic trope entirely.I think its simply that the light novel industry in Japan is more mature so there has been more time to not only develop the tropes but also for people to begin to deconstruct them.,noveltranslations,d0ruhui,1,t5_39owk

6862303,0,t1_d0u4itf,I dont wanna burst you bubble but there are basically no authors or translators that do it for free. They basically all have donation andor ads so they earn money off of their readers so no they are not doing it for free. Even doing some free chapters a week doesnt make it free overall.Im not against earning money from their work but doing so basically makes it a job and as such I think its fair if the readers and especially the donators ask for quality which includes accurate translation good grammar and a site that is actually readable. Dont think thats too much to ask. You can ask basically every decent translator like RWX or Deathblade to name examples and Im sure they would agree with me on this one.I mean just look at the rates for chapters for example  for an extra chapter they spend  hours on still makes it better than a lot of people make in their day jobs per hour. There are translators that take less but also some that take more so I just picked  which is around average its just to make a point anyways.I love to read all the novels here just as much as everyone else but that doesnt mean that Im ignorant of what is going on. Sometimes the community has to do more than just mindlessly say thanks on every update post and actually give out some constructive feedback. If more people would stand up and tell translators whats wrong with their work we would all profit from it as the quality overall would rise.,noveltranslations,d0u5h8y,5,t5_39owk

6913269,0,t3_4affwv,Hi I just got into this reincarnation VRMMO series. Its like if you mixed MC from Zhan Long with MC from The Kings Avatar. Reborn Thieving the World  The story starts with MC at  heart full of vengeance destitute with family dead betrayed by their relatives. He trained himself for  years to take revenge by killing someone who plotted against his family and took over their corporation. But after shooting his enemy in the head he is shot and killed in the aftermath. He wakes up as his  year old self. After waking up he decides to play a VRMMO game that he spent  years playing a game that has just been released  days ago. A collaboration between  major countries. In his previous life he was a level  Rogue. I really want to call it Thief because its the literal translation in Chinese A veteran player of  years a half step away from being part of the top tier elites. Spoiler he was ranked in the s. Follow Nie Yan as he creates a legend with the knowledge from his past life. Remeeting friends and enemies in both the game world and real world. Hes not going to sit idle this time while others plot to take away everything from him and his family. The game is obviously so important in the future more money is spent inside the game than outside of it. In his previous life his dads company tried to enter the game to expand but their enemies plotted against them and destroyed them financially due to their late entry to the game. If not for the MCs close friends he wouldnt have been able to even survive. This life he isnt going to forget about those brothers.  of the story takes place in the game world where he uses his experience and familiarity with the game to gain an absurd advantage. Everything from exploiting the auction hall to knowing the best strategies for clearing instances to gaining legendary items and he doesnt forget to recruit famous top tier people to his cause. It reads very similar to Kings Avatar in that sense. In the real world he is going to take advantage of his youth and train his body in the same way he trained to prepare for assassinating his enemy in the beginning of the story. He uses special forces training techniques to quickly harden his body able to fight  regular people with no problems. He also has a love interest from the previous world whom he had karma with but they were not fated to be together. He also develops a light love interest in the game world this time around. Only  is focused on romance so it hasnt progressed very much yet. I think the best way to describe MC is a Ye Cho that isnt a vegetarian. If he makes an enemy he wont let them go easy. He will viciously take them down. The leveling process in this series is much slower than most other series. Kind of like how quickly they level in Amber Sword. Each level is significantly important and will take days to level up.,noveltranslations,d0zxvip,1,t5_39owk

7132485,0,t3_4d94d6,Ive read a lot of manga and manhwa of various genres and to be honest I still find the plot of the mangas more interesting. The mangakas generally tend to have better story telling capabilities. And not to mention the art that gives the story the awesomeness. Most of the ones Ive read have storylines that stand apart from the rest maybe its because I pick them so. Im really picky when it comes to reading. So maybe I might not have read the mangas that have bored peopleCN novels on the other hand I find more bland. Most of them use the same setting. Its just a story about how the MC is awesome and right all the time. The world is generally dull and every other character pointless and useless. Even the main characters are usually one dimensional. Im not saying there arent any novels that I think are simply mind blowing  like ISSTH and ZTJ. Those novels are what every novel should be  either a masterpiece of creativity or a work with a palette of colourful personalities. But sadly its not so. Based on the works of novels and mangas Ive read mangas were of better quality. But to be honest right now Im reading novels more than manga. Its because of the much higher release rate and because not many good manga are on the table right now.Verdict I still feel mangas deliver better stories than CN novelsEDIT I have to make it clear that I do not view anime and manga as the same. Mainly because animes tend to cut stories or change the feel and pace of the manga making it a different story. Also I dont watch a lot of anime. So I have no opinions on original story animes and the like.,noveltranslations,d1ovudc,2,t5_39owk

7167121,0,t1_d1srgnv,gt You keep saying without proof. The amount of evidence that was provided while not absolute proof  because as I said this cant be positively proven unless there was like a police investigation  is more than enough to make this a worthy question. Did you actually read the post?  He didnt provide any evidence that the story wasnt whatsoever..  The first thing that was put was that the title picture was taken from somewhere else.  Well duh.  That happens a lot anyway.  And the translator pretty much said the novels werent written by professionals.That makes it less likely that they hired an illustrator.  This isnt evidence of anything one way or the other.  Even the OP admitted so.. amp .  The OP and his friend couldnt find anything about the author or title in a search.  Again this proves nothing.  If I wanted to accuse someone of lying Id make darn sure I have something stronger than I asked my friend to search for it. to back me up.gtQuestioning the OPs intentions of course is absolutely fine. It would be dumb not to do so. However everything youve suggested about his intentions is far closer to baseless slander  suggested to you by nothing more than I guess his wording tone and the fact hes an English author  than any of the stuff he himself is saying about the translator of Empyrean Overlord.That is also why I say the OP is likely right as well.  But it isnt proof.  Which is what the OPs title says he has.  There is no actual proof given only educated guesses.  So even if they are right the OP is as much a liar as the translator.  Which is very ironic considering how he keeps going on about how terrible it is to be lied to.My only issue is the way the OP went about this.  I see what he is doing as being a jerk.  If they only wanted to find out the truth contacting the translator directly would have been more than enough.  Instead it looks like the OP wants to shame them by bringing all this forward in the most public way possible.,noveltranslations,d1su0uu,1,t5_39owk

7168339,0,t1_d1sr3ns,Since you are the accusing party I think it actually lies with you...This is what wikipedia has to sayThe burden of proof Latin onus probandi in the United States is the imperative on a party in a trial to produce the evidence that will shift the conclusion away from the default position to ones own position.The burden of proof is often associated with the Latin maxim semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit the best translation of which in this context is the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges.She or he who does not carry the burden of proof carries the benefit of assumption meaning she needs no evidence to support her or his claim. Fulfilling the burden of proof effectively captures the benefit of assumption passing the burden of proof off to another party.And also The presumption of innocence sometimes referred to by the Latin expression Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit non qui negat the burden of proof is on the one who declares not on one who denies is the principle that one is considered innocent unless proven guilty.,noveltranslations,d1sz0u4,-1,t5_39owk

Then no mention of her whatsoever until Ninelotus the little  brother that makes constructs and the other reincarnated immortals visited Ning and talked about the conclave. No interactions happened between them during this time. As he was smitten with Ninelotus. Youngflame Nong picked up Ninelotus Ning and  reincarnated immortals and went to the whitewater estate. Ninelotus had to act professional because she represented her clan Yu Wei did not as she wasnt a representative and any illwill of Nongs had no repercussions on her background.  So Yu Wei and the other BlackWhite College kids backed up Ning until shit went down and they all went home.

7214061,0,t1_d1y4qz1,Ive seen this argument too many times now. And I feel like I need to chime in.First off is it really unauthorized if its a public post on a public forum? Its identical to me taking a stock photo off of google. As long as I site the source is it really unauthorized? I personally dont think so.Second I didnt donate to them for the story I donated to them for the act of translating the story. Why? Because I can easily find a completed book in English for  or so bucks because I can read English and easily available to me. However CN novel where I cannot find easily and I also am unable to read. It is worth more to me. Therefore while the story keeps me entertained I pay for the translating part. The part that I am unable to attain. If there was an official up to date that the author offered? Youd bet your ass I would pay them money for their story. And that last part about everyone acting like theyve been wronged? It probably because they were. The fact that the story is good or not is not part of the problem. The problem is that they knew going that it was an original English work then masked it as a translation. And collected the cash. And honestly fair value for an EN work? Are you joking? How many EN Web novels are finished that you know of? How many would cost anywhere near what these guys ripped off their readers. I can go to amazon and buy the entire Harry Potter series for under  while sponsoring a chapter with these guys cost . Doesnt seem right does it?I know youre upset that they like many other EN web novels got dropped before theyre finished. But dont let your opening sentence be about logic and then not use logic in your argument. Bottomline they tried to trick their audience and failed. And everyone was rightfully upset. ,noveltranslations,d1y6lco,19,t5_39owk

They wont be able to figure out who did it because he should just equally affect all of those in each clans faction. whilst showing his own expertise is a good thing here because he needs a strong reputation to make his words matter.Also its not like showing his desolate heaven technique is actually going to reveal any of his extremely important cards.

I think one consequence of this however is that Zorian and Zachs original bodies will be left lifeless husks because the Sovereign Gate wont be in possession of their souls anymore the gate will have nothing to update their real bodies with. Kirielle is going to love that . . . Its interesting to think about what the effect on the real dimension was when the primordials dimension was opened.

7846766,0,t1_d3xszux,Personally I havent entirely ruled out the possibility of Daimen being Red Robe yet but I find it increasingly unlikely. My expectation is that in a near future Zorian will travel towards him and use his help in finding the artifacts.As far as your theory goes the one big issue I have with this is that we have been given no indication whatsoever that Red Robe would have the ability to travel back within the time loop. As far as I know hes someone who eventually learned about it from Zach and found a way to tag along with him just like Zorian. I used to think that Daimen had a lot of potential with this but not anymore. In fact from what we can tell this time loop thing never activates randomly only when there is a planetary alignment. And the reason Red Robe left so early was because he believed that all of these parallel copies of the world would crumble as soon as he steps out of the loop just like Spear of Resolve the Ghost Serpent and Zorian believed.Red Robe has now completely left the time loop and is now independent of it. He most likely no longer has the ability to access it but he has reaped the benefits from his presence there. And his early exit is now a problem for Zorian and Zach as they need to figure a new way to exit the time loop before it finishes.Edit Something I just realized is that if Zorian were to talk to Daimen in the time loop now it would not rule out the possibility of Red Robe being Daimen. Since the soul with the marker he was using to loop with Zorian and Zach is no longer in the time loop and has now exited the Daimen that gets copied is simply the one that was present at the beginning of the month when the time loop was initiated. Its still possible that the arc will go on until they exit the time loop with Daimens help who doesnt remember anything the entire time only to come back in the real world and find a new version of Daimen with all of Red Robes knowledge. So nothing is ruled out yet about Red Robes identity.,noveltranslations,d3y1n83,4,t5_39owk

Fighting on the outside seems like a good idea if you know that the person youre going to be killing doesnt have enough power or backing to resist but this time hes against the huge and growing Demon League as well as the powerful Heavenly Path League. While the alliance gives them a brief advantage at the first battle this means that after killing them once they cant do anything until they leave. Seeing as how everyone is still getting crap tons of spirit stones from Nie Li and dont have any problems cultivating they seem destined to be destroyed. Especially since Gu Heng has lost his prominent position in the clan to Gu Bei. I dont think there was a situation in which this works out favorably for Gu Heng. At best his alliance could kill them all and have them revive at the institute.

8034963,0,t1_d4ixunk,Im not sure youre right about that. The immortal murdering swords were apparently made by the true spirits. From chapter  summary thanks to uPMMETITSMLADY gtBasically  spirits descended from above I assume the immortal realm.gtThey became ancient true spirits.gtAfter a long time these spirits split into their will and their true body.gtThe will ascended presumably back to heaven and their true body became the Immortal Murdering Swords.gtI am not sure what a discarnate spirit is though perhaps some remnant of the true spirit will that was sealed or perhaps some spirit that wish to possess the true body.Another problem with youre theory is that Meng Hao only burried  swords but as stated there were  immortal murdering swords before Meng Hao copied an th.But about the time swordsMeng Hao knows how to make time swords by following a guide in  volumes called the Classics of TIme which he bought in the secret auction in chapter  What I think is that the person who wrote it found Meng Haos swords and studied them and from that wrote it based on them which then Meng Hao followed to make the swords that the guy studied to.... Etc thus creating a time loop around the creation of the wooden swords.We know the sword tip is from a time sword but not one Meng Hao buried there so I believe its from one of the swords made by the person who wrote the guideWhile I do think theres a connection between the time swords and the immortal murdering swords and have a personal theory about what the connection is but for me at least thats only based off the fact theyre the only wooden swords we know of in the story I dont have any evidence to back it up beyond that.,noveltranslations,d4j7ejz,3,t5_39owk

8176464,0,t1_d4zl43m,Actually I am quite fond of his personality. Hes one of the few more realistic MCs that I have read. Nothing about him is OP Yet. Hes poor and doesnt have anything. On top of that his parents are dead. So his personality of money grubbing miser came from the fact that he needed Spiritual Stones to survive. If he didnt have Spiritual Stones he wouldnt be able to train and wont be able to live in the city. If he doesnt live in the city then there would be lots of mobs outside and hell likely be killed since hes a low level cultivator. Hence his personality is completely logical. I read that many people were angry that he pissed on the green gowned old man. However if a random guy were to appear and tell you I am a super ancient assistant that would help you become great. However you must provide me with food and do as I say. without showing any proof and youre super poor and in a bad mood already what would you do? Keep in mind that youre a person whos focus for the past years had only been on making enough to survive and didnt really know much about the world around you.. Piss on the guy?. Kick the guy out?. Provide him with food and listen to him?Hes quite a bit of a pervert but he reminds me of Rudeus Grayrat although perverted he doesnt take advantage of others.

The funny part was when the mc was a shocked about it. He was all like I didnt think that he would really do it. WTF! The guy had killed tons of people before. He even killed his own men and uses evil methods. He even kills children and stuff. I love that a guy who has lived at least a thousand years is so nieve. He may have even lived up to a million IDK. Eather way he should not be such a f tard. It was almost as nieve as the princess in against the gods who didnt want to kill bad guys. She was all like My master says that anybody can change. Even if they rape and kill little girls. Even if they killed your whole family. Even if they eat the hearts of babies. They can still change ok.

There will always be trends where certain genres will be more mainstream than others Xianxia is popular right now that is true but there are tons of other web novels being written. You admit it yourself I dont see why you disagree.You use stuff like animated cartoons and anime as an example there are stuff like Finding Dory at the same times as stuff like Ben  and Looney Tunes. On the other hand for anime it ranges from stuff like Re Zero to stuff like New Game. The difference between these shows and novels is that there are a lot of translator for these shows so you actually see a larger variety for them compared to novels where there are less translators a lot of translators prefer to pick from the top charts because that is currently more popular in China or actually prefers those genres so they translate it.,noveltranslations,d6d353i,2,t5_39owk

The item would still be top tier if all it did was contain the independent realm with purer spiritual energy for faster cultivation For the Goddess amp the Bird. But after he kept introducing other benefits it destroyed any sense of tension or danger to exploring the outside world. So far we know that it can upgrade divine tools literally farm spirit stones and because it is attached to his soul  he never has to worry about dropping gear. And these are just the functions we know about Nie Lie doesnt know the full scope of what it can do.I know around this time was when the author was slowly putting less and less of his resources and attention on this story but I can almost see him saying fuck it how can I get this guy to make Bill Gates look like an impoverished refugee. Other than the small reveal of Xiao Yus origin this entire arc hasnt really developed anywhere story wise. The author just dumped NL into a candy store and said go nuts. He has gotten the Primordial blood boatload of gold spirit essences grade  equipment illusion pearl and a page of the book. He literally just walked in and took it because hes the only one skilled enough with arrays. And because of the painting no one has any chance of taking it away from NL. Not that it matters if he gets into a fight and dies anyway because as weve seen from his last death its a very minor inconvenience at best.

I love reading every single line because  otherwise Im gonna miss some golden line. I love the little tid bits the author effortlessly writes.Also the tranlator does an amazing job.

9161623,0,t1_d8d9uyf,Wan was a key word trap. Since its a fallacy in my argument I can defend. The text explicitly states Fang Weis urge to fight does wan around the time Meng Hao hits  meridians.  I can defend my point because like before when MH hit    and so forth...when he hit  Feng Weis urge to fight MH still just ends up being reinforced. To the point of madness.  Its the same with the other Chosen. Their urge to fight just comes back stronger.  Even when they close their eyes its to preserve their will to fight.  Thats how much the want to fight him now.  They wont let the number of his meridians psyche them out. Do I believe that they would have run over if he only opened  meridians. Nope. Not at all. Youre taking my argument of them stepping into true immortality to fight Meng Hao as me meaning that they would have thrown themselves at him at if he wasnt so dazzling right now.  And I never was trying to imply that. Some of them with grudges would have faced him later if he survived the fight again Fang Wei but there wouldnt be this motivation to throw themselves at him en mass like now. I never tried to say they would.  Im just describing why they are willing to fight now.  And hey! I no longer have to. Cause you just did. So to your statement ofYe though I was specifically talking about it in this singular situation where there is literally just a train of poor saps waiting to get bopped for what seems to me to be really silly reasoning.Ill just quote thisIt was only after he transcended them all that they suddenly desire a sudden need to do battle.  ... they fought because Meng Hao shined so brightly he threatened to eclipse them entirely and they felt they had to fight to not be blot out by his radiance. You get it. But you dont agree with it.  Maybe that isnt enough to satisfy you throwing themselves at a stronger foe instead of waiting and doing more preparation. But They had to fight not to be blot out by his radiance Really does sum it up. Very well put.,noveltranslations,d8dax0b,1,t5_39owk

9207149,0,t3_56gbhh,This was so satisfying.. Im so glad that he decided to go all out right away not just for shock value that is so often the case in a lot of series but because its the most logical course of action. It raises the moral of his men while also saving a lot of their lives that would have been lost had he not immediately done so.Even if he is still hiding some of his skills in the future the simple fact that he realizes not going all out in situations like this will just get people killed or end up wasting time is enough for me. Too many MCs do that and are written that way by the authors of various series solely for the whole reader shock amp hype when they finally do step up. I hate that.Also I think its great that Locke is starting to accept the fact that he is a Lord now.. He is really stepping into the shoes nicely.

9443762,0,t1_d9d1p1c,So we agree on GC being a complete wildcard. Ill agree that YH being broken by one loss is entirely on him BUT from a narrative standpoint hes the only gold general weve seen as an adversary so far and its been mentioned there are a few hundred silver generals but much fewer golds is there a higher rank or is it just sky yao?  so in chess terms you could say silvers are pro golds are Chessmasters and theres a mysterious number of grandmasters somewhere. What weve seen is a wildcard destabilize a Chessmaster so hard hes mentally broken which is something youd never expect from a chess match and thats what throws me off. Not just does GC cement himself as being highly effective when he goes off but this also carries negative implications about gold generals in general since again hes the only one weve seen so far. If we wanted to establish that some generals arent the most mentally fortituous why not use a high ranking silver thus leaving the prestige of golds alone? Im not asking this from an in character standpoint but a narrativemeta viewpoiint. Im confused by why FX chose to write this conflict this way is all. ,noveltranslations,d9d2b96,1,t5_39owk

9545819,0,t3_5bmn5z,This is pretty difficult to answer as there is nothing specific that says Meng Hao has achieved the Dao or that Meng Hao has been crowned as Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm. However..  In chapter  when Meng Hao is in the Ancient realm around  lamps extinguished the Mountain and Sea Realm are at war with the  Heavens and Meng Hao completely obliterates the st Heaven. Most of the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm already look upon him as Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm.  In chapter  when the Mountain and Sea Realm are on the verge of losing to the  Heavens the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm are given a chance to surrender and the  Heavens promised to not hurt them. The Ninth Sea chose to surrender and leave the Mountain and Sea Realm. Meng Hao asks if it is because of him. The Ninth Sea replies that even though she regrets defying Meng Hao back then she still would have made the same decision even if there was no Meng Hao. This is because the Mountain and Sea Realm was on the verge of being destroyed and the Ninth Sea didnt want to be destroyed together. And so there was no more Ninth Sea in the Mountain and Sea Realm.  Achieving the Dao basically means reaching the highest point of cultivation one can reach. In chapter  after Meng Hao has achieved the Dao he meets the Ninth Sea again. Meng Hao leads what is left of the Mountain and Sea Realm to fight back against the  Heavens. When the Ninth Sea appears the other cultivators are so enraged at seeing her that they attack her immediately. The Ninth Sea blames Meng Hao for making his promise to eradicate her a long time ago. She says he threatened to kill all her descendantsdemon cultivators and wiping away her existence hence she had to rebel to survive. Meng Hao says that since she developed sentience and a traitorous mindset even if he hadnt made those oaths she would have still rebelled at the earliest opportunity she had. She says that she just wanted to be her own individual entity and not part of the Mountain and Sea Realm forever. Meng Hao says when she dies everything will be past and that the future Mountain and Sea Realm didnt need her. Meng Hao then throws her into his Essence of Divine Flame burning away everything except her soul which is tortured in flames. In chapter  Meng Hao recreates the Mountain and Sea Realm using his own Dao. When he recreates the Ninth Mountain and Sea Meng Hao fulfills his promise to Guyiding TriRain and transforms her into the Ninth Sea. ,noveltranslations,d9ppwp3,8,t5_39owk

Hes pretty oldschool as far as translators in the community go he was a mod on SPCNET and was translating classic Wuxia novels before the boom with ST and CD so if hes recommending such a simple method then I doubt other translators put too much more thought into which novel they translate.Of course some translators probably read and subscribe to a bunch of novels on Qidian and choose one of their favorites to translate.But it sounds to me like there might not be any decent tools to filter the wheat from the chaff even in the Chinese webnovel community.

The major novels of this Era would probably be Coiling Dragon Against The Gods Martial God Asura and Doulou Dalu.Novel Translations Era Starts with the split with the Light novels subreddit. The defining novel would probably be I Shall Seal the Heavens. Landmark events would be the completion of Coiling Dragon marking the first Xianxia to be completely translated.Korean Era People getting tired with the Xianxia tropes begin to look to korean novels causing korean novels to explode with popularity.I agree that Rens licensing agreement with Qidian is probably ushering a new Era.

10143303,0,t1_dbthl3u,This is mere speculation but what if the will of that Door has been corrupted? As of right now it seems like Fang Xiufeng is going to be protected by plot armor and also we might see how the rest of the Dao Tribulation reacts to Meng Hao. Thats going to be interesting dont get me wrong. My point is what if Er Gen tried to increase the stakes and the tension by trying to kill Fang Xiufeng for real? Im wondering if that kind of plot twist could even happen considering how wildly the odds are in the Fang Clans favor. Let me make it clear that Im only wondering this because I think itd be interesting to have some tragedy sprinkled around in this wish fulfilment story. Lately it seems that Meng Hao doesnt seem to have tangible stakes in the story that goes on around him. Everything seems to be happening around him as opposed to happening directly to him.

It isnt impossible to survive reincarnation intact but the entire soul must cast aside the fetters of his body and everything tied to it. Soul puppets and clones break when you remove the soul. To reincarnate is to die and be born anew again.What youre thinking of is probably more like a soul possession ala Black Belly Miss or that soul magic Meng Hao used in the blood demon sect to make a clone and power it with an immortal soul.,noveltranslations,dc2jymv,1,t5_39owk

Yeah he doesnt wanna be a hero again because of all the suffering he and his family and friends had to go through but that doesnt mean he has to be a cold hearted and ruthless person who never cares for a stranger being trampled. Hes just gonna do what he wants without having all the hopes being put upon him. It doesnt mean if he ever saves someone of his own volition its an immediate blunder due to the authors writing. Hes just human. Also its not just because shes a girl. Theres clearly something wrong with her and he wants to know what. Such as her magic being different from what he knows. Im sure he also heard about beta saying how she saved the girl from the mage tower so he probably wants to know the whole story.

11712746,0,t1_dgmwa5p,Stainless is definitely the name of the sword though. spoiler because technically s If you read through  its clear everyone is talking about the sword itself although they talk about the technique as well. For instancegts Stainless The painter from the Pavilion of Divination thought in astonishment could it be that a new name will finally appear on this years Tier of Legendary Weapons?s I assumed Zhou Ziheng was asking about the name of the sword itself since thats the name that CCS responded with. Its still not entirely clear to me whether he was asking about the dagger or technique in . If he was asking about the technique then CCS misunderstood the question and only understood when he asked the second time and responded that it was a technique Su Li taught him. Then the second question was a clarification of what he actually wanted to know originally and the line you quoted would be referring to the question in  or both questions.s I think he may have actually asked about the sword in  then when he said Thisjust what sort of sword is this? he was asking a different question about the technique. In which case the line you quoted is referring to this question and not the first or both. Its a little ambiguous and I think both are reasonable interpretations but I dont think CCS misunderstood him. Either way a small detail.edit Added spoiler tags. s Also right before Zhou Ziheng asks the second question hes thinking about the way CCS defeated his Star Domain which is more of an issue of technique. So its clear his mind is at this point considering technique and leads to me think he may not have been thinking about it earlier. In  hes focusing on the wound itself and everyone else is speaking of the dagger itself which makes me lean towards my interpretation.,noveltranslations,dgno3nl,1,t5_39owk

11779496,0,t1_dgv7gxy,Yes its possible that the passage I translated with Lord Lis monologue doesnt mean he reached Daosource. Honestly its hard to say. I even had RWX check the translation on that particular passage before publishing it and he approved but it wasnt until later that I started to think it could possibly be interpreted a different way. Still waiting to hear back from Er Gen about it. Either way it doesnt change the final endgame of Lord Lis story. And as the other comment up above mentioned its been purposefully worded in a vague way that doesnt specifically say how many there were.,noveltranslations,dgv8rts,8,t5_39owk
