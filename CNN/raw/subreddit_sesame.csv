7007976,0,t3_4blsdh,Well hey there. Didnt know anyone knew about this place.Have you joined the beta groupWe just built a Quick Search feature. If you long press on Chrome Maps Waze Yelp and Spotify youll be able to launch a search much faster. Were going to do a v of that feature soon.Right now were working on an onboarding flow. We kinda drop ppl into nothing now and anaytics says lots of ppl abandon on day  but ppl who make it past day  stick around for good. They call that a leaky bucket users come in and too many go out. So weve got to fix that. Should take a week.Then well go back to build more and better shortcuts. Any other questions?,sesame,d1ap717,1,t5_3cgvr

If so Sesame will create shortcuts back to any group you receive a message from. That took us a couple weeks to build and its kind of a buried feature.  Itd be great to do it from Contacts instead of Hangouts which turned out to be easier to build off of anyways. I took a quick look and couldnt make much sense of groups in the stock Contacts app. I know how to add ppl to a group but cant seem to find the groups Ive made...  If we can figure out how to find the groups Im confident we can make the shortcuts.  Ill add it to the list. If others upvote well do it sooner.,sesame,d21tu2o,1,t5_3cgvr
