If I stumble across something that appears to give me an edge in a certain scenario Ill try it again at a later time.Also yeah that top Kat game was a clusterfuck and I was already pretty tilted and I just sort of built whatever the hell. Ravenous plus Sunfire worked out really well for splitpushing however and Ive used it before to good effect against Gnar. Honestly Riven didnt stand a chance she needed Veigar and Yi to come to even kill me and both of them died trying. She just barely made it out herself. Three ults and two flashes just to feed me two kills didnt even get her a CS lead since I still had TP.Pretty much every Kat top game is an experiment for me. I try to run her as an ad cdr bruiser because its fun when no one can run away since youre e aa wing them every . seconds for quite a chunk of damage.

9879994,0,t1_davdnq1,That build is just kinda bad overall late game it wont be any better then a normal build. The biggest problem is the power curve it will give you as you see he builds deathcap last. He just wont be as strong as he could be at certain power spikes. No doubt tho this is a safer build but you wont have as much dmg ofc. As for the protobelt thing yeah it could work but most of the time you will either lose out on the dmg on proto or the dash to dagger unless your enemy line up on the dagger and you do not have shunpo.Also she legit does not have many unfavorable matchups in mid. ,KatarinaMains,davdx6w,1,t5_34nsa

This is more than enough for me.Every season has their perma bans. Remember Ahri permaban season ? She was extremely fun to play as well at that time.Kat may be banned a lot but she is not banned as much as Kass in his hayday.And whether she is as fun as old Kat is a different and very complicated argument. Bottom line is that old Kat had match ups where you had ZERO impact on the game since you lost lane before the game started. Did you forget about old Kat verses Kayle? Or old Kat vs Kassadin?Current Kat is STRONG so enjoy her while you can. Riot will probably nerf her since she is ridiculously strong. Either that or they will never change her if they think she is balanced. Ori is quite a good champ that Riot never changes but I think in the right hands shes op too. But dont lie to me current Kat is MUCH more reliable than previous Kat.,KatarinaMains,ddnaux6,1,t5_34nsa

11354904,0,t3_6212jk,Its hard to say. I have a hard time saying that Kat is unbalanced right now but I can see the argument that her early game a is a touch strong. To me the CD nerf seems really heavyhanded though.If a nerf is needed I would rather see early ability damage numbers QE turned down a little. This would keep her combo intact and powerful late but early would require you to poke your opponent down before going allin.I am not sure a nerf is really needed though. I think that a lot of the frustration people facing Kat are feeling is that they dont understand where the dagger spin radius is  that is they dont know where they can stand safely once the dagger is on the ground. A faint circle around the shunpo range circle that shows her possible spin radius might be ALL that she needs for people to have the chance to play around her without feeling like it is unfair. I have had no problem playing against Kat since I understand her dagger spin range and can safely stay out of it when I need to. That makes me think the problem is information not stats.,KatarinaMains,dfj22ru,5,t5_34nsa

Keep pushing mid force their jungler to help their mid and perhaps even their top laner to come to you. This grants your top laner leeway to push or farm up and thus you are already helping your team grow stronger.
