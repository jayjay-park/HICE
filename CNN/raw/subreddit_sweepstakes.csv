5260519,0,t1_cvizvis,This is correct. Most sweepstakes are posted in public directories and sweepers are going to find them either on this board or another one. There is another factor I thought of when I saw this question posted that has nothing to do with math. The whole bonus entry type of marketing is somewhat new. When I started entering sweeps before Twitter and Facebook it didnt really exist because social media wasnt really a thing. Even though marketing companies seem to love the bonus entry method after all it does the work for them they dont really want sweepstakers to win their products. They want who they perceive as potential customers winning them. There have been many times where I had HUGE amount of entries in a giveaway yet still didnt win even one of the lower prizes. I think sometimes they bypass people with huge amount of bonus entries.  I wonder if it would be possible or people would participate on this board in a simple poll telling us if they won what they posted on here. It would be interesting to see if bonus entries work on a larger scale. I just got back last night from a trip to NYC that I did list on this board thank you!! and typing this on a new Leveno laptop I won that came while I was in NY that I did not list on this board. Wins come in all directions. I love sweepstakes. ,sweepstakes,cvk38jm,1,t5_2rgoc
