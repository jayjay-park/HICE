1660804,0,t3_2ddazu,Sunderland and Ston seem underpriced and QPR overpriced. Would love to bet on Burnley to stay up. It seems like the team no one gives a chance to stay up has the last few years. Too lazy to look that up though.,sportsbookextra,cjoi99w,1,t5_32rc9
1664923,0,t1_cjoy3c6,Although I agree that our OLine is improving the OLine was in the top  but nowhere near spectacular. It seemed like on every possession Fitzpatrick was being flushed out of the pocket and had to scramble for yards. I think the OLine will be top  this year but top  might be a bit of a stretch. Combine that with the fact that we have no QB and very few receiving targets I dont like our chances to win the division. However I am looking forward to Sankey starting at RB and I think our defense will hold down the fort again this year. It is possible we finish top  in the division but not st.,sportsbookextra,cjp0x4j,1,t5_32rc9
1837713,0,t3_2f7bjm,Thanks for the info GrumpUhLump!! The contest and picks are able to be madechanged until late tomorrow night I believe so I can always change them but after reviewing the format of the contest I had to change my picks a little bit from what they originally were Now its  picks  Total picks. Heres what I got      . Atlanta  . Chicago  . Tennessee  . Minnesota   . New England    . NY Jets    . Philadelphia    . Pittsburgh    . Cincinatti    . Washington    . San Francisco   . Tampa Bay   . Denver   . NY Giants   . Arizona   . ClevelandPittsburgh Over .   . San FranDallas Over . . IndyDenver Over .   . NY GiantsDetroit Over .  . San DiegoArizona U .Current Line on most of the OUs is way higher than what they have in this contest.. I was kind of confused as too why they are willing to give up such an edge and even ask the attendants about it but they seemed clueless to what I Was talking about. Honestly I am not entirely sure why  I took U . on SDARI but when I filled it out I noticed I was taking all OVERS so I decided I must take  under.. Might change that. Might even change CLEPITT to Under.My lady also has entered and we are opposite sides on games I feel could go either way since she doesnt care much. I took mostly Dogs in low pointspread matchups and she is taking mostly favorites. She has Rams Chiefs Ravens Texans Carolina and Detroit.,sportsbookextra,ckan2r2,1,t5_32rc9

2841162,0,t1_cnqwgc7,Memphis is at the top of a better division. Has only  less wins than GS and just got an additional scorer. And their odds given are nearly three times worse. And your statistic doesnt hold much weight if nearly half of those teams didnt even make the playoffs. Plus how many of those  teams played in a weak conference. The  west is strong ,sportsbookextra,cnr1cy4,1,t5_32rc9
2973924,0,t3_2u81b7,Props on your props I like all of those picks. I worry about Blount being too obvious of an option and Seahawks being all over him unless the pats have it within  or  yards. The field goals are tough too just because its hard to predict if both teams will even kick one at all. That being said I still like all of your picks and might end up following you on some. ,sportsbookextra,co65fmx,1,t5_32rc9
