1013950,0,t3_25p1g1,Ive got a Warmoth boat profile neck as well as one of their Claptons. The Boat is definitely way chunkier due to its full  depth but I usually forget about the Vness within a minute or two of starting to play it. Same with my Martin that has a V profile. Just a comfortable neck feels like a regular neck except with that extra protrusion in the palm of your hand that gives you something to hang onto a little more and there is less fatigue. Also no problem getting my thumb around on any of these necks.Edit The Clapton is a little thin for me btw but still a very nice neck.,Stratocaster,chjjkf2,2,t5_2rl4j
3115296,0,t3_2vtsxc,Id advice you to look at your guitars pot resistance. Theyre probably k while the recommended value for humbuckers is k. You can use k but it may be a too muddy. However the single coils will get brighter with the k volume.I recently put a Tone Zone in my own strats and I wired it with  volumes one volume for the tone zone one for the middle and neck pickups following this diagram except for the tone pot  since I didnt have a dualgang pot I just wired it like Gibson Explorers I think which is more or less like that Best of both worlds !,Stratocaster,cokweom,1,t5_2rl4j
