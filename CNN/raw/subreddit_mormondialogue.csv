2167437,0,t3_2jsyty,I think this is overall a very good point that definitely deserves discussion. Ive had it explained to me before as Josephs speakingasaman moment. There are a lot of different ways to take or explain this but a thorough explanation probably includes all of them. There are some instances where Joseph simply misread or misspoke or when his scribe misheard him drugs instead of dregs. There could also have been moments when uneducated Joseph didnt understand a particular word or phrase even though it was presented to him in English so he just made something else up. If god did indeed mean to say that America was inhabited by tapirs Joseph most likely had no idea what they were and so could have simply said horse as the next thing that came to mind. Or perhaps Joseph saw a picture of a tapir in a book at his local library and concluded that because it kind of looked similar to a horse that it was a kind of horse and so said the word horse instead of tapir while he was translating. Or perhaps the BoM was partly a direct message from God and partly Josephs imagination which is why we had wars with an exaggerated millions of people death count. However this explanation raises several other questions such as if Joseph was going to be SUCH an unreliable translator then why would god make him literally the only author of latterday scripture especially when The Bible had so many different authors? And if Joseph was planned to be only author of latterday scripture from the beginning why pick someone so incompetent as to give nonbelievers so much ammunition to logically show the BoM to most likely be false? OPs point is only the tip of the ice berg here.,mormondialogue,clfbygh,1,t5_34246
2273317,0,t1_clsoz7r,Great idea again. One reason why its a great idea is that currently one of the main criteria for considering bishops is their organizational ability. There is a lot to administer at the ward level. Thats why you see so many business professionals get these kinds of callings. Take away the administrative stuff and we could call bishops whose strengths are pastoral care instead.,mormondialogue,clsp8tw,2,t5_34246

2503737,0,t1_cmlahvw,gtI dont know that Jesus was proud about it but I think this tension is at work as we read about him. How did he have so much confidence and humility at the same time? How can we do so similarly? My favorite LDS people both in my personal life and the public figures straddle this well. I try really hard to do so also but dont always succeed.Its a difficult line to straddle. Having firmly held beliefs means that we must at some level think our beliefs are superior to those of our neighbors  otherwise why would we have them? I struggle with that even though I would never say in my mind my beliefs are superior to his. But I feel that idea there in my mind just below the surface. Even though I dont allow myself to think it in words.Love the Alma  thing. I think the thing about orthodoxy and exclusivity is that it causes us to look only inward. When we start taking seriously that others faith journeys are just as valid as ours we look outward and we learn from others more readily instead of approaching them thinking that we are the ones who must teach them.gtThe cyclic nature of religion doesnt just apply to JudeoChristian groups.What do you mean by cyclical nature?

2697180,0,t3_2qxwk4,gtIts about working under the assumption that we are all Gods children interconnected by eternal bands of brotherhood and sisterhood.If the church is all made up how do we even get to this assumption in the first place? Im struggling with my beliefs right now too and Ive done a fair amount of destroying the myth starting with much of the Bible but I dont see how we can say that truth is something we can just construct for ourselves. We can construct goodness and happiness. We can construct a way to draw closer to God. We can invent stories to teach morality. But even if those are true in whatever sense you want they will not ultimately be truth. I guess I cant reconcile what the author is saying. If I concluded that The ChurchTM  was madeup I dont think I could still follow the assumption that theres a God and were his children and the Church is just this madeup thing to help us get back to and live with him as the Church teaches. Truth is truth. Things exist or they do not. There is a God or there is not. While I think you can destroy a lot of the myth of the church and still retain a belief in its trueness for lack of a better word you cant throw the whole thing away and still call it true. You can call it helpful good a positive influence for people and society but you cant call it true in the sense of an absolute truth. ,mormondialogue,cnan25c,6,t5_34246

Here is an interesting fact about religion There are thousands of them. Since religions claim to know the truth to life and they all have different truths not all of them can be right despite the fanaticism they nurture. At best only one religion can be right.

3449851,0,t1_cpldkio,gt I think your argument is even though you have to go through all the motions the motions arent important the results of the motions are important. But if you cant get the results without the motions the motions are important.More or less thats it. But a conservative to that is that the means and results of religion are divinely inspired and not merely an invention of man though I think God allows room for mankind to participate in that revelatory processits not merely a dictatorial process. Peter puts it this way Peter gt  For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.As for Poelman I think it was a shame his talk was edited. Its possible that theres additional context surrounding that event that frames it better. And its also possible that the church leadership at the time simply overreacted with unwarranted zealousness. Either way I like Poelmans original talk. But I do think that its unreasonable to think we must necessarily project narratives from this  year old event onto current church leadership.In the end we must ethically use religion because there are unethical uses of it to become like God in ability righteousness knowledge mercy power etc. And that requires a balance of the things we find in religion.I like Hugh Nibleys perspectivegt Our search for knowledge should be ceaseless which means that it is openended never resting on laurels degrees or past achievements. If we get puffed up by thinking that we have much knowledge we are apt to get a contentious spirit and what is the cure? Correct knowledge is necessary to cast out that spirit. TPJS The cure for inadequate knowledge is ever more light and knowledge. TPJS But who is going to listen patiently to correct knowledge if he thinks he has the answers already? There are a great many wise men and women too in our midst who are too wise to be taught therefore they must die in their ignorance. TPJS I have tried for a number of years to get the minds of the Saints prepared to receive the things of God but we frequently see some of them . . . that will fly to pieces like glass as soon as anything comes that is contrary to their traditions they cannot stand the fire at all. TPJS If I . . . go into an investigation of anything that is not contained in the Bible . . . I think there are so many overwise men here that they would cry treason and put me to death. TPJS But he asks Why be so certain that you comprehend the things of God when all things with you are so uncertain? TPJS True knowledge never shuts the door on more knowledge but zeal often does.I think Mormonism is susceptible these kinds of overzealous expressions that Joseph Smith warned against. I think that warning is needed as much today. But I think that susceptibility isnt something unique to Mormonism but is something thats common in humanity. Overzealousness or hubris is a common human flaw and Mormonism isnt immune to it.,mormondialogue,cplicp7,1,t5_34246
4198793,0,t3_38xuiz,gt It is also why many Mormons like myself have a postmodern turn to their minds. We more than most others recognize how socially constructed truth is. It really is what people agree to believeor what methods of ascertaining truth they concur in.gt ...gt Isnt there some kind of human existential truth that resonates with ones desires for goodness and divinity? And is that ultimately why we read the Bible as a devotional work? We dont have to read the latest issues of the academic journals to find out if the book is still true. We stick with it because we find God in its pagesor inspiration or comfort or scope. That is what religion is about in my opinion and it is why I believe the Book of Mormon. I cant really evaluate all the scholarship all the time while I am waiting for it to settle out I have to go on living. I need some good to hold on to and to lift me up day by day. The Book of Mormon inspires me and so I hold on.It sounds to me that what he is trying to say is that truth is just a consensus made by a group of believers and that he believes in the Book of Mormon because it inspires him.,mormondialogue,cryuvf4,7,t5_34246
4249011,0,t3_3936f0,. I would say that relgions in general and mormonism specifically do claim to offer all of the answers.. Personally I think that religion is typically a hindrance more than a help when it comes to truly ethical behavior.  Would you concede that regardless of truth or falsehood of any particular relgion they all rely on interpretation?  I feel that most not all but certainly most christan sects and islam treat a lot of things based on ancient understanding that has little bearing in the real world.  Unfortunately the feelings and surety of rightness are going to be difficult to combat so the reality is religion is here to stay for quite some time most likely in the marketplace of ideas and in peoples interpretation of ethics.Lastly as somebody that doesnt lean on religion I cant answer that question as posed I can offer you insights into how I think other peoples religion negatively impacts their ability to see ethics clearly and to properly assign positive and negative impacts when it comes to calculating the utility of any given action but I cant answer it as posed.,mormondialogue,cs4krys,1,t5_34246

5440212,0,t3_3pf9wn,We often say that all Mormons are cafeteria Mormons but I dont think its always true. Yes there is always picking and choosing which things are important but for many Mormons that picking and choosing is done by General Authorities and the Correlation department.Even when it comes to behavior we generally choose the officialcommon behavior. The Word of Wisdom could be interpreted in many ways but I dont know any Mormons who drink beer and believe that they are keeping the Word of Wisdom. I also dont know any who think that hot chocolate violates the hot drinks clause or who think that cold coffee doesnt.Personally I do pick and choose which things I believe. I dont just pick the things that sound nice to me I pick the things which stand up to scrutiny the things which hold up when applied to life experience the things which I feel I have received spiritual confirmation for. Some things e.g. Abr.   The land of Egypt being first discovered by a woman who was the daughter of Ham and the daughter of Egyptus which in the Chaldean signifies Egypt which signifies that which is forbidden are easily disproven and can be put into the I dont have to believe that pile.Even if I could accept the whole package as given and believe it all Id have a really hard time determining what that package contained.

6374737,0,t3_42urgi,Miracles cannot be in contravention of natural law but are wrought through the operation of laws not universally or commonly recognized.  Gravitation is everywhere operative but the local and special application of other agencies may appear to nullify  as by muscular effort or mechanical impulse a stone is lifted from the ground poised aloft or sent hurtling through space.  At every stage of the process however gravity is in full play though its effect modified by that of other and locally superior energy.  The human sense of the miraculous wanes as comprehension of the operative process increases.  Achievement made possible by modern invention of telegraph and telephone with or without wires the transmutation of mechanical power into electricity with its manifold present applications and yet future possibilities the development of the gasoline motor the present accomplishments in aerial navigation  these are no longer miracles in mans estimation because they are all in some degree understood are controlled by human agency and moreover are continuous in their operation and not phenomenal.  We arbitrarily classify as miracles only such phenomena as are unusual special transitory and wrought by an agency beyond the power of mans control.In the contemplation of miracles wrought by Christ we must of necessity recognize the operation of a power transcending our present human understanding.  In this field science has not yet advanced far enough to analyze and explain.  To deny the actuality of miracles on the ground that because we cannot comprehend the means the reported results are fictious is to arrogate to the human mind the attribute of omniscience by implying that what man cannot comprehend cannot be and that therefore he is able to comprehend all that is. . . . To the believer in the divinity of Christ the miracles are sufficiently attested to the unbeliever they appear but as myths and fables.To comprehend the works of Christ one must know Him as the Son of God to the man who has not yet learned to know to the honest soul who would enquire after the Lord the invitation is ready let him Come and see.Jesus The Christ James E.

7539247,0,t1_d2z3z8a,I think there is less difference than you think.  Im arguing that most of the world at all times has had little to no accessibility to Jehovahs scriptures or Jesus many being slaves who couldnt leave especially since it was a commandment to be obedient to your master.  And you cant seriously be arguing that in whole civilizations nobody was interested in the truth.  From your perspective nearly every person who resided in Africa was disinterested in the truth while nearly every European in recent history was very interested in the truth.  Doesnt that sound a bit convenient to you who were born into the possibility of finding Christ through a billboard on the freeway or by overhearing a neighbor?  Doesnt that make your god even MORE arbitrary in some ways than the god of mormonism?You may continue to believe that everyone had the possibility to be taught about Christ including people who knew nothing of boats that could cross any sea people who lived in such remote places that they didnt know other humans existed and all of the humans that existed before Jehovah was first communicated withinvented.  But from my perspective it just looks like you need to believe it because you want to insist your god is fair even though he clearly is not.  gt But thats not how the LDS God behaved. During those  years people could have searched every city and tribe on earth and they wouldnt have had a chance to find the true gospel. There is a big difference.You do realize that throughout history people could have preached in every city on earth and they would have missed many cities?  I think youre superimposing the way you conceptualize the world upon history.  For most people in history their conceptualization of what existed in the world ended at their personal experiences or the tales of their scholars and soldiers.If those seeking the truth were derelict and thus never became acquainted with Jehovah or Jesus doesnt it also follow that those that wished to bring the truth to those who didnt have it were equally derelict?  As easily as seekers of god could have found places that hadnt been discovered seekers of converts could have found them.Either way Im good with the interaction weve had since Im reasonably sure youll come back with some other cliche idea about why an all powerful god really is just even though he didnt preach to most of the people who have lived on the earth.,mormondialogue,d2z6c8i,1,t5_34246

The vast array of Christian sects is evidence enough of that. We have no reason to believe that any of them are less sincere in their prayers or less committed to follow Christ yet they diverge from each other in countless ways.

10505993,0,t1_dcyvl80,gtDid the protestants pray to know if their church is true and God answered them? All you said in your OP was that they prayed for guidance. If they never specifically asked God if they should join the Mormon church or even if they should be protestant then how does the fact that they prayed for guidance rule out Mormons getting correct answers to their prayers? They never asked. All they wanted was general guidance and God gave them that.My church small groups that have gone through quite a few Bible studies from The Gospel Coalition a group of pastors and authors who write curriculum to help churches stay grounded in sound gospel doctrine. None of the studies Ive done mention Mormons at all but Ive talked with enough Mormons to know those gospel doctrines strongly contradict the LDS gospel. Yet we open andor closed each night with prayer asking God to guide us to reveal truth to us to open our eyes to what He wants to teach us etc.Are we just wording the prayers wrong? Why would God reinforce those false gospel doctrines? So when we get to heaven and are disappointed that we were following a false gospel most of our lives whats God going to say? You didnt say the magic word. Why would God require believers to ask such a specific question before Hell reveal the truth to them? Thats certainly not in the Bible.gtIf thats the case then either these  of Christians are contradicting the Bible in praying for guidance to know the truth. Or else they are not praying to know the truth in the first place which means that you cannot say that them not getting the answer Mormonism contradicts the Mormons.gtIf thats the case then either these  of Christians are contradicting the Bible in praying for guidance to know the truth. Or else they are not praying to know the truth in the first place which means that you cannot say that them not getting the answer Mormonism contradicts the Mormons.Look at how the apostles taught the gospel in Acts. They didnt ask people to pray to know which faith is true. Of course believers should pray for guidance on various issues but its not the primary method of determining what church is true.gtAnd if they are protestants because they prayed and God told them to be protestants then how do you not have the same problem Mormons have? Why isnt God telling everyone to be Christian?God is telling the world that through the Bible and believers Hes sent out as missionaries.gtHow do you know that Protestantism is true? Because of the Bible? How do you know the Bible is true? Because it says so? Or because you prayed and God told you? Why not the Koran the Vedas the Bhagavad Gita?The Bible is the only one of those books that was supported by someone rising from the dead. Protestant beliefs follow the gospel the apostles taught.gtBut to specifically answer your questions on a personal level I dont know that Mormonism is true. I believe it is but I dont just believe in it because I prayed and feel God answered. I believe Mormonism in part because it is a lot more consistent with the Bible than Protestantism.First of all did you grow up in the Mormon church or have you been in any faith other than Mormonism?Mormonism teaches there are multiple kingdoms in heaven. That would be a very important doctrine but its not taught in the Bible at all.  Cor.  is Paul contrasting earthly bodies with heavenly bodies. Heaven itself isnt mentioned at all let alone separate kingdoms in heaven. How is that consistent with the Bible?gtBut if anything that disagreement only underscores the problem of relying on the Bible in isolation to determine true religion. Many Muslims believe in the Bible as do some Hindus many Hare Krishnas all Mormons Jehovahs Witnesses and so forth.From another post here Every denomination claims to follow the Bible but many have drifted further away from it because they rely more on personal revelation or feelings more than the text. Thats why we have some denominations focusing more on modern social issues rather than doctrines of a real living God. Theyre not really following the Bible. The pewforum.org link above is a perfect example. They asked  Catholics what sources of guidance they use for right and wrong.  said common sense  said philosophyreason  said science and only  said religion.  of them may read the Bible but how much do you think those  actually follow what it says?gtIf Protestantism is working for someone bringing them closer to Christ giving them a better life why would God lead them out of that to Mormonism? Similar things can be said of Islam or Buddhism or even atheism. If they work for people thats great.Then why are there so many passages warning about false teachers? The Galatians didnt turn to amoral atheism. They just added a little of their old laws to the gospel yet Paul still harshly rebuked them for perverting the gospel. Im sure those beliefs worked for them just fine just like false gospel work for many people today but it wasnt a harmless teaching. They were deserting the one who called them. They were deserting God. Where do you get the idea that a false gospel can bring someone closer to Christ? The concept certainly isnt consistent with the Bible.,mormondialogue,dcyys24,1,t5_34246
