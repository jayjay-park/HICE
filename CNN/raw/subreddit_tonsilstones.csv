4011322,0,t3_33ancl,I had a really terrible experience with my tonsillectomy. I originally had them removed because there was a bad infection Id been getting way more tonsil stones than usual coughing up  a day and my doctor advised I just get them removed. i was able to talk fine after a day but I was only able to eat liquid foods for  weeks to start. After  weeks I started getting really sick apparently my stitches came loose and Id been swallowing a lot of my own blood without knowing because they were so far back I couldnt taste the blood trickling down my throat. Had to go back into the operating room to get my stomach pumped of all the blood Id consumed and to restitch my stupid tonsil crater. It took me another  weeks to recover after that. So I was on a liquid diet for over a month total. Probably the worst month of my life. My advice is to constantly check but do not touch the cavities where your tonsils were after surgery. Also try not to agitate your throat or your stitches might come loose like me.,tonsilstones,crdisdm,2,t5_2vtfp

5460206,0,t3_3pt598,Just like you said looks like a canker sore. I get them all the time especially when stressed. I was able to buy this stuff called Debacterol from my dentist that you can apply right to the sore. Hurts like whoa and your mouth tastes like a campfire weird comparison but trust me but it works like a charm to clear up canker sores.,tonsilstones,cw9ld02,2,t5_2vtfp

6119252,0,t3_3ynv1a,if you look up tonsils it turns out they are actually made up entirely of crypts inside lol. but the only illustration offered is from a  yr old medical book so it doesnt show much. As others have said tonsils can become pitted and scarred by past infections. If your sister is not suffering horrific breath from these dont dig just leave em alone. the body will eject them naturally. ,tonsilstones,cyl71wh,5,t5_2vtfp
6195104,0,t1_cytnzn4,Its probably normal popping them out of only one tonsil though perhaps your other one has some that are buried deep. Or maybe the other one just doesnt have any crypts for food to get lodged in. For me Im right handed so its easy to tweak my right tonsil and get some stones but I have little dexterity in my left hand and so I struggle to get them out of the left tonsil.Yes to the tonsillitis I had strep throat really bad one time with all this white smelly crap all over my tonsils. Seriously it was a freak show and my friends across the room were telling me how nasty my breath was. After it passed I noticed the crypts looked huge and I started getting the stones worse than ever.I can kind of feel the stones in the back of my throat also if you get a bad taste in the back of your mouth you might have some back there. Tastes like roadkill imo.As for the gag reflex suppressing it is the same as trying to hold in barf while hurrying to the bathroom haha. Ive tried sticking my fingers down my throat to make myself puke but I could never get it to work. Sounds weird but I think I was just born with the ability to suppress my gag reflex. Maybe look at Ipecac you might try taking some of that so you can practice keeping your stomach contents down though Im not sure if its safe to do that.Ive heard you can flush tonsils out with a Waterpik or maybe a syringe with warm water. Never tried that though. I get the most stones out of the top two crypts on my right tonsil though the biggest stone I ever saw came out of the one below that. Everybody has different crypts though and I do pop them out everywhere.Purple! Whats yours?I guess I try to enjoy popping them out but Im eager to just have my tonsils removed. And then stop chewing  pieces of gum every day. Good luck tonsil buddy!,tonsilstones,cyttfz2,4,t5_2vtfp

8900690,0,t3_524gdv,This JUST happened to me not an hour ago. Ive found that it usually means that theyre built up in a hole by that specific area for me its always the same hole. It also happens after Ive poked around in there and my nails are too long. Maybe thats a different thing but yeah.,tonsilstones,d7hqhap,3,t5_2vtfp
