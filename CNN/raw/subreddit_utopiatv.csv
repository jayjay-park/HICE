1692432,0,t3_2bhiez,I think all the drawings in Utopia were metaphorical like Janus isnt actually a giant two headed god. For instance in Grants drawings it says they put the ghost cell in the buffalo and the man eats the buffalo and rots. Obviously the ghost cell is the amino acid and the buffalo is food but people wont physically rot from consuming the food theyll just be sterilized when they take the vaccine.,utopiatv,cjshtm8,1,t5_2w2mf

1699356,0,t1_cjsws6i, Milner asked him to kill both Arby and Jessica because theyd be the most capable people of stopping them. This isnt stated but implied Those were the five canisters that were to be released. Wilson plans to use them still but with a lot more control over its spread. Im guessing we will see more of that plan in S.,utopiatv,cjtd7of,1,t5_2w2mf

1833695,0,t3_2fennh,I made a reddit account just to follow this subreddit since I dont know anyone IRL who has watched this show.I like this thread but Im gonna have to mostly disagree with OP. Most of these actorsactresses are comedians and if they were cast for those roles I think I would always be subconsciously waiting for a laugh that never comes.Donald Glover as Ian sounds great but I dont know how that would work because as far as I know Glover is focusing on his music right now which is why he quit Community. Have you heard Because The Internet though? It is dark he could easily pull this off.Milla Jovovich as Jessica Hyde would be great as well imo. But Im not sure how good she would be at portraying the quirky slightly demented side of Jessica.,utopiatv,cka5l0k,1,t5_2w2mf

5436563,0,t3_3pelyl,First off great discussion topic emblematic of the countless things that there are to talk about in Utopia and why its my favorite show. If youll indulge me Im going to really sink my teeth into it. Im also going to talk about season  so spoilers if you havent gotten that far.I think the answer to your question lies somewhere in the middle between you and your friends opinions. You are right that Pietre takes out the rock to demonstrate to Jessica that they are siblings its the quickest most direct and probably only way to get her to believe the truth. Pietre while a complete psychopath is very intelligent and practical in the way he thinks and he shows throughout the show that hes pretty adept at reading people and understanding what they are thinking. He may be detached from reality but he understands enough of it to know that a rock cannot literally give him permission to do anything more on this later. But I agree with your friend that the rock is one of the most important symbols of the entire show. Its important to remember that Carville not only gave a rock to his son and daughter but Milner as well and by extension Wilson. To me a big part of Utopia is the exploration of the philosophy of good and evil and how the war that rages on between the two in the mind of the individual spills out and affects the rest of the world. Another relevant and important theme is the rationalizations justifications and erosion of morals that occur when one takes on the sheer insanity of trying to fix the worlds problems. Aside from being a demonstration of the love that Carville had for the three characters the rocks are the distillation of these themes. Carville was a genius able to see the depressing insanity that is the bigger picture and understand that the world is filled with moral relativism instead of concrete blacks and whites. When he tells his offspring and Milner This rock gives you permission to do anything hes illustrating the fact that despite our perceptions of identity and morality and reality there arent any limits to what we are capable of positive or negative with the proper mindset. For Pietre and Jessica this philosophy allows them to overcome the practically insurmountable obstacles that prevent them from living a good life by embracing the fact that they are capable of change if they shift their perspective and put their minds to it this is much more evident in Pietres redemption. For Milner and Wilson it allows them to abandon their sense of humanity and morality through rationalization and logic and become monstrous by embracing brutality. Carville himself used this philosophy to embrace the Mr. RabbitNetwork way of looking at the world but he also was mentally unstable and went insane and destroyed the ones he loved by following that path to its logical conclusion.This all ties in to the idea that we always have a choice between doing good and inflicting evil whether we realize it or not and that things can always change for the better or worse. A vicious child killer can embrace his longlost humanity. A sweet conspiracyminded loner can become the leader of a murderous shadow organization. Ian goes from being against killing at all costs to murdering Terrance to save the world. Becky goes from certain death to being simply strung out. Even Carville the originator of all the evil we see on the show gets a second chance at connecting with the only person he ever loved. Utopia embraces that the world is an often cruel place filled with evil and that we are by all measurable accounts heading towards certain and complete oblivion but it also gives it characters the chance to fight it and change things no matter how bleak the outcome may seem. Ultimately were all just the blink of an eye. Thats an undeniable truth but what are we going to choose to do about it?,utopiatv,cw6kpt0,8,t5_2w2mf
