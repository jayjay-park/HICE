5973197,0,t1_cy2l38u,Im glad someone enjoys my rambling.   About the receiver rail Id always assumed it was made taller to stay the same hight as the handguards upper rail which has to cover the chunky gas block and piston. The short stroke piston doesnt take that much more space in the upper receiver than a gas tube from a normal AR.  Heres a cutaway render of the MRA from HampKs website.   Im not  on this though so dont quote me.  ,Gunime,cy2m87g,3,t5_2zjqa
