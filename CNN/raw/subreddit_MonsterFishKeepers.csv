What you put around the outside to make it look nice is completely irrelevant to what comprises the structure of the tank. You can cover it in rose petals it doesnt matter. The inside NEEDS to be sealed if youre putting water in it. Ive used pond shieldpond armor in the past and it was absolutely amazing. Another option ive seen people use is fiberglass but you need to know what youre doing to work with that. A possibly simplercheaper option would be to simply drop a liner in to the tank. Ive seen all done successfully. There is nothing wrong with doing a single pane on the front just keep in mind your dimensions and calculate your thickness with a very high margin of error. My guess is youll need at least  acrylic if not more. My best suggestion for search terms would be plywood tank DIY plywood aquarium or some combination like that. Honestly your best resources are going to be www.monsterfishkeepers.com and www.predatoryfishkeepers.com. Theres even a section on MFK specifically for DIY builds and projects,MonsterFishKeepers,d9rey7b,5,t5_2t4rm
