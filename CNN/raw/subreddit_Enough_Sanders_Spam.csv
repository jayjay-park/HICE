Now were seeing the hilarious truth again in DWS words  spoken like someone who isnt a Democrat and has no idea what we do.Basically this whole boils down to one thing. The Berners wanted to use the Democrats massive generator with a million outlets to plug their revolution into. The electricity worked great worked just fine until their guy lost the right to plug in. So they said FINE! WE DONT NEED YOUR GENERATOR! WELL MAKE OUR OWN!And in true millennial fashion everyone got together to plug their phones into their new responsibly sourced nonbillionaire money but actually yes billionaire money built generator only to realize they didnt have one not even a small one.

Whats the difference? All of Hillary Clintons nontroversies are reported as people are outraged or it raises questions even though people are just learning about it or there is nothing there but innuendo. Once again I will refer to the Clinton Foundation scandal which was a completely made up story.

But it was all dropped for the same reason nobody cares about Bernies flag except people who were never going to support him it didnt stick or hurt the candidate.So you are in favor of the media dropping a candidates legitimate scandal you must be forgetting he still has to stand trial just because it does not hurt his candidacy? That is bullshit! The media drives the narrative and if they talked about it every day the same way they have yet to shut up about Hillarys emails it would have been a bigger story.gtOh believe me sexist white male not even true atheist Berniebros did far more damage to him than socialist communist jewish radical.Absolute conjecture on your part. You have no evidence to support that.gtAll of the uhh you guys Bernie isnt a Democrat I have literally no idea how any of this worksWhich is a fact. He wasnt a Democrat. Many of his supporters proudly claimed not to be Democrats yet expected us to fall in line behind them due to their selfproclaimed moral and intellectual superiority. In fact do you know who broke the rules of the DNC to legitimize Bernies candidacy by allowing him to be a superdelegate before he registered as a Democrat? Take a wild guess.gtstinkpieces never got pulled because they were shoved neatly onto the blog space of their websites... and then pushed onto the front page and Google anyway. So again how is this an opposition campaign?Youre really going for broke with that contrived narrative huh? The studies that have been done to empirically detail which candidates have received negativepositive press show that Bernie Sanders received higher positive to negative press than any other candidate so cry me a river. gtIm guessing your suggestion is that they GOTTA nominate whoever she says they should even if its Pope fucking Francis?You completely pulled that out of your ass.

Nice selfawareness.If youre going to be glib and sarcastic it helps to mention what the hell you are actually referring to. Just a thought brainiac.gtIt signifies that its a big possibility.Thats not what you said though. The implication was clear the phrase came from Hillarys campaign.

Sanders winning NY or CA although I hoped! but Im still very proud of the little known  year old self described democratic socialist who inspired millions and came within a few percentage points of getting in the way of your anointment of Sec. Clinton the most well known and establishment backed democrat of our time. I even met him briefly and he was lovely. If your asking if Im voting for Sec. Clinton now Im not. But thats not too shocking since I wasnt really ever a democrat. I voted for Perot Bush Bush Obama Obama. I only became a registered democrat to vote in my states primary. Does that mean Im voting for the cheetos colored one? Nope. Im appalled by each of them although its singularly pathetic that Sec. Clinton cant seem to really pull ahead of that laughing stock! There was an A rated poll the day before this final debate that even had Trump up by a percent or so! Also considering the absolute contempt the Clinton campaign Wasserman Schulz Donna B. et al. have shown to indys like me not to mention rabbid nasty mouthed acolytes like yourself are you surprised that we all havent decided to be with her!? Maybe thats part of why she just cant clinch it. But youre right about the fact that she was  with the orange guy at the debates I didnt watch them all but its pretty clear. Bravo. Shes still the most unpopular dem to ever run she wont have my support or that of many other independents and she still would be losing to almost any other opponent. So shell probably win against Trump which is about as impressive as her win for senate against the nobody so congratulations? Shell be far less popular than Obama with an equally divided and recalcitrant house and senate and plagued with one scandal after the next as soon as your beloved media is safe in the knowledge that she won. Theyll turn on her as soon as they smell the blood and well get  years of scandal and special prosecutors and impeachment hearings. Congrats. Not sure what you gained for your cause calling me out Im hoping for Bernie as the next Senate budget committee chairman. Ill always support the man. He was with us. ,Enough_Sanders_Spam,d911bs5,-5,t5_3fmhe

Conservatism is more of s modus operandi while modern two Republicanism is more of a valuesidentity based practice.Im a conservative progressive in many ways. I want to see us implement a public option but I want it to be voluntary. Any city county metro area group of countries etc. should be allowed to either form their own plan or become a single collective bargaining unit in order to achieve economies of scale. Same for states but localities should be allowed to compete against states in the markets if theyre more efficient. Incentivize market forces within a public project. Choice and competition are American conservative values.Clintons proposals contained a huge number of programs aimed at assisting families. This was predicted on the idea that families are the foundation of society. That strikes me as a conservative idea.There are numerous other examples but what Im driving at more than anything is that the Republican Party has ceased to be conservative.,Enough_Sanders_Spam,dagnu2u,3,t5_3fmhe

Then in  there was an obvious shift in how they covered her. Republican Buddy Roemer invested M in TYT in . When I put on my tinfoil hat I liken it to how Republican PACs were backing Bernie during the primaries they knew he was the weaker candidate so they wanted him in a general election but in addition he was also softening up Hillary for the Republicans. Add in the True Progressive media online possibly  TYT for sure  funded by Republicans and you have a twopronged attack. But Kyle is just a pure hack. I loathe this guy. Hes everything wrong with online news sources. He cant look at anything objectively. His bias seeps into everything. For instance hes such a biased hack that I watched him in the same video bemoan every single poll and projection made that Hillary was going to win this election. Polls were wrong. Brexit happened. Trump won. Only to turn around and argue Bernie woulda won as evidenced by....THOSE SAME POLLS! Hes went on Tweetstorms crying about the establishment and corporate Dems running Tim Kaine in . Despite Kaine literally already having come out and said he has no plans he will not be running. I just knew that the RT part of the report would TRIGGER these fools. Theyre so predictable. The report is oversaturated with RT because everything RT is public. Therefore they can talk about it more. Isnt the case with everything else for something that should be commonsense if they show you all their evidence they compromise sources and methods. Our enemies would then know how we know. They can better attack us and cover their tracks. Theyre just. so. fucking. stupid. Theyre a lost cause.

But let me guess you cant tell the difference between how a dictator acts and how one does not... first rule of socialism you control the peoples health care nice try Obama but now you got another guy to whom the left wants him to be a dictator. Why? Why is media like CNN and MSNBC and entertainers on comedy central want Trump to be a dictator? They are literally claiming he is a dictator while saying they do or dont want a dictator like Obama? Like does the left only want a dictator if he is or isnt a racist? I mean which is it?Obviously you missed the last  years wit Obama being president if the right suddenly starts claiming that a control over health care which is a move to socialize the country socialist cookbook seize a nations health care system is NOT a dictator behavior but Trump repealing the ACA mandate that provides you with more choice over less choice makes Trump a what?Btw I didnt vote for either party candidate.Besides this... why is the left suddenly using the same formula against Trump that the right has been using on the left with the Obama administration calling him a dictator? Does anyone in media or entertainment realize they are copying the last  years and just calling the side what it called or attempted itself to be or do...You must ask yourself why? Because the left want dictatorship because they can force you to do things through government. The right doesnt want you dependent on government. So im left questioning why left bias media or entertainers are copying the last  year equation the right used on Obama since he was attempting to grab and control your health instead the left is screaming dictatorship which is what they want...

10525698,0,t3_5qp9d6,Unpopular here DWS and Booker actually kind of suck and are not great politicians though not really for the reasons Bernouts say.Also the Bernouts and Trumpets do have a few good points about political correctness playing a role in peoples distaste for liberals and in intensifying internal divisions. Bill Maher had a good segment about this last night. I wont go so far as to say identity politics should be ditched entirely but white people taking offense on behalf of groups who arent even offended shaming people for cultural appropriation and innocent slipups and demanding trigger warnings at universities and shit must end. Bills also right that it is extremely hypocritical of liberals to ignore or gloss over the terrible and terribly illiberal human rights abuses in many Muslim countries in the name of cultural diversity. And its also dumb to deny that radical Islamic ideology is in fact a thing and not all problems in the Middle East are the result of American intervention.Unpopular elsewhere Bernie Sanders is literally the single largest reason Trump is President. More than Comey Russia anything. He split the party at the worst popular time he brainwashed his young followers with bullshit rightwing lies about Hillary and it spilled over to the general election when he made a halfassed at best attempt to undo his damage. Oh and he never could have won if nominated and in fact he would have even lost the popular vote because once he was in a national campaign in which he was subject to attacks by the likes of Karl Rove who would not wrongly paint him as a radical communist sympathizer he would have been eviscerated. You can kiss Florida goodbye after everyone hears those Castro tapes.Also if you didnt vote or voted for SteinJohnsonWritein you are just as bad as a Trump supporter in my eyes and I hold you in just as much contempt. Literally everyone in this country who was eligible to vote but did not vote and vote FOR HILLARY CLINTON is a complete fucking idiot as far as Im concerned and I have zero sympathy for anything that happens to them over the next four years. Every last one of them can go fuck themselves and if they choked on a chicken bone I would laugh. Yeah Im literally saying that if the majority of the country dies I wont care. Thats how pissed off and disgusted I am with my fellow Americans right now for allowing this monstrosity to happen. Seriously Im hoping for a new plague in which Hillary voters can mark their doors with lambs blood and the rest of the country is fucking wiped out by the wrath of god.Oh and one more thing I am hoping to see violence at this point. Wouldnt do it myself but if someone blows Trumps brains out I will celebrate. Fuck that go high bullshit. We are in the New American Reich and the global order is about to collapse. Its DEFCON . Im pissed at Obama for even relinquishing power to Trump. Our traditional peaceful transition of power is not worth allowing this to happen.

And enough people thought it was okay to either not vote or throw their vote away on a rd party candidate with no hope of victory. Im not disputing any of this. Fuck Bernie fuck Trump but Ill be damned if I let that get in the way of making valid criticisms of a campaign that lost DESPITE winning the popular vote by a nearhistoric margin. At the end of the day that doesnt mean anything because Hillary is not in the Oval Office doing what she does best. And besides me saying its a valid criticism is in no way saying its the only reason. Id say its indicative of a larger problem with the Democratic Party which is that we are totally unprepared to match the Republican machine. We abandoned a winning strategy in the early s and now were here. No one is saying we need to change our message or platform well besides Bernie and his bros with their stupid identity politics line that comes straight out of Karl Roves ass. What we absolutely do need to change is how we deliver that message. We had a filibusterproof majority barely  years ago and that was blown very quickly.

10961881,0,t3_5wjsgf,Alright lets gogtThey didnt vote for her because shes a woman Nope as much as sexism played a role people did not like that particular woman.what does this mean? This is very glib.  Sexism played a role but it didnt prevent anyone from voting for her? Well then it seems like your thesis is that sexism in fact didnt play a role.gtThe only reason Barack Obama became the democratic nominee is because the Clintons grossly underestimated their opponent.Wrong.  The Clintons dont have the power to nominate themselves.  Hillary Clinton lost to Barack Obama because he was a great career politician.  She doesnt control the media.  She doesnt control how people vote.gtIf they had seen what was coming they would have destroyed him and manipulated the party apparatus before he could take flight.Wrong and vague.  There is no party apparatus that the Clintons have the power to manipulate that can prevent a candidate from defeating a Clinton.gtA couple made a pact about taking turns to be president. And when it was apparent the people didnt want that they kept going. Crazy.People liked Hillary Clinton. They liked Barack Obama more.  She destroyed Bernie in the primaries and received over three million more votes than the current POTUS.gtIt wasnt a vote for Trump as much as a vote against Hillary and what she represented. And most liberals still dont seem to get that.Vague.  Unsubstantiated.  Again here we are with the allegations of Hillary Clinton symbolizing or representing bad things.  Never any substance.  Only apologies and easy outs for people who chose white tribalism over a woman who made them feel icky.gtYou know the craziest thing? I cant think of a single democrat who can beat Trump four years from now. The talent hasnt been nurtured.Wait is she saying that the Democratic Party should be nurturing and training candidates for the Presidency??? Really? That doesnt seem undemocratic?gtBut I guess were at the blame the Russians blame the hacking phase of the debate so no one wants to acknowledge the elephant in the room.Wait. I thought we blamed sexism and even though sexism played a role somehow without persuading anyone not to vote for Hillary us stating the plain fact that Russia paid hackers to break into DNC servers in order to leak sensitive information in order to sway the election in favor of a candidate who they were in constant contact withapparently thats passing the buck.  Okay.gtAll of that stuff worked because the democratic nominee was a robotic candidate who didnt connect with voters and failed to campaign enoughAll of that stuff worked because whereas a male candidate could have thrown up his shoulders like what can I say? Im a sly old dog! I do and say what I want lol! that option was foreclosed for Hillary Clinton who was expected to be perfect unlike her opponent.gtMind you I actually like Hillary. I appreciate her ambition. But I also see why a significant portion of the electorate wouldnt like herHer ambition? You dont appreciate her lifetime of service? Her tireless efforts to help people? Her expertise? Her intelligence? Her indefatigable resolve to protect the rights of atrisk people all over the world? Just her ambition.  Okay well that puts her on a par with Madonna.gtDoes no one see the nepotism when the wife of a former president is the first female democratic presidential nominee? The optics are awful.Nepotism is when a person in power grants undue power to a friend or family member.  It doesnt apply in this instance firstly because Bill Clinton did not have the power or influence to grant Hillary Clinton the Presidency and was in fact used to attack her in her own campaign efforts.  Also Hillary Clinton was the second or third most qualified candidate for President in the history of the United States of America.  So no I dont see how its nepotism.gtAnd heres the thing a lot of people including Democrats didnt want to be with her they wanted to be with Bernie.This is true of every singe party primary that has ever happened in the history of politics.  There are multiple candidates.  They have followings.  Their followers hope that their candidate wins but they agree in good faith to support the eventual candidate whatever the outcome.  That did not happen this time.gtAnd still today any criticism of Hillary is viewed as antiwomenantifeminist. Its insane its like theyve learned nothing.Wait I thought sexism played a role?  I guess not.  I guess this is what the authors been trying to say the whole time.,Enough_Sanders_Spam,dean2h1,16,t5_3fmhe

Like lemmings following the string of profit theyll happily step off that cliff.Property is not a relationship between a person and a thing. This is the fundamental mistake that people make about property. Things have no property property nothing about them is quantifiable as property. Property only exists as a social arrangement between two or more people.Once you realize that property exists only as a relationship between people you can start to analyze those relationships and get useful information about the form the property is taking. And since human social structures are fluid and arbitrary property is also fluid and arbitrary. This is where propertarians get confused as they think property is an objective state of being for an object regardless of the social environment it exists in. The idea that an object can be multiple forms of property simultaneously confuses them greatly.LOL You cant possibly pass this off in a college that is decent.

Once Hillary screwed Bernie a lot of people saw Trump as their last chance to make things right for everything that the Clinton campaign did to destroy Sanders and his supporters.If Hillary had won it would have killed Bernies movement for good because they would have made sure a true progressive will never stand a chance again. You can just look at how even after the loss theyre still trying to suppress the progressive wing of the party as much as they can. But now that theyre losing power theyll eventually have no choice but to change or it will destroy them. Only then can Bernies movement finally succeed. Thats what my point was. Wayofthebern is one of the few subs that understands the bigger picture and how Trumps victory will end up benefitting Bernies movement in the end. Edit I just now realized what sub Im posting on. Why am I explaining myself to a troll sub? You guys are paid to act like wannabe chan newbs.

Were not even accepting refugees from this country!  We dont have a functioning State department!  Without the normal procedures functioning any military action will solve absolutely nothingI mean if Trump moves to actually create safe zones that would be something.  I dont think thats whats coming though.   I should point out that Ive been prointervention in Syria from about a year after the start of the conflict.

I thiiiink what most of us are taking issue with is that Sanders turned his nose up at the high profile Georgia th his comment on how progressive Jon Ossoff was was kinda dismissive and made him seem petty like a kid whos jealous of someone else getting more attention than him. As usual hes not walking the walk and being a true progressive. He appears more interested in being the savior and his anointment of Mello kinda rankles after his aforementioned dismissive attitude to Ossoffs campaign.

11705213,0,t3_66zpwa,This is not only the right thing to do this is a beautiful strategy on the part of the Democrats. Perez and the Dems have been bending over backwards to placate Bernie and his Bernouts but this Unity Tour showed clear as day that Bernie doesnt give a damn about anything but indulging in the attention hes wanted his whole life. And say what you want but there are plenty in the Dem leadership who actually do give a damn about civil rights and minorities and reproductive autonomy but the fervor of the Berniecult means they cant outright contradict his screeching dogwhistles saying basic human rights came second to the economic needs of angry white people.But Bernies defense of an antichoice candidate gave them a perfect opportunity to start squiggling out from under his doddering old thumb. Perez is Assuring those outside the Cult of Bernie that the Democratic Party will not be abandoning human rights to chase after white people Sending Bernie a warning that the Democratic Party is not going to sit back and be his bitch Tacitly broadcasting the suggestion to everyone that just maybe some old white dude from Vermont is not the ultimate arbiter of what is and is not progressiveI dont envy Perez hes got quite the tightrope to walk. Bernies all too happy to tear apart anyone who interferes with his ego trip. Yet every moment Bernie spends pushing back against the prochoice ultimatum is another moment he exposes how few shits he gives about people who arent white men. Like he probably will start shitting on Perez because he cannot abide anyone who challenges him. But hell be digging a hole to his own irrelevance and that time cannot come fast enough.,Enough_Sanders_Spam,dgmt2x5,10,t5_3fmhe
