11068428,0,t1_deldv1v,I know man old rengar was more fun due to mechanics like the old trippleq. But new lb the playstile shifted hard. Everybody could win lane as lb but in late game u needed to be fast get ur combo and hit first instance of the chain. I mean she is still beast in the early but late game if i jump backline while frontline isnt dead u gonna have a bad time. Also the old lb had good poke so it fits more yoloq comps but now if u pick lb with a bad compno frontline only hard engage with low dmg carry.. u r basically done.. feelsbadman..New galio abilitys look cool and i see him as a top tier jgl but the playstyle will change and this will every galio main feel bad ,galiomains,demlgld,2,t5_37bmq

On the other hand his tank stat scaling and his base damages are very good making a tank build very strong on him.,galiomains,dfb0bwe,3,t5_37bmq
