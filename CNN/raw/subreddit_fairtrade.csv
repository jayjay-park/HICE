3627978,0,t3_2ys8s7,I would definitely consider buying a Fairphone. I would purchase if it was a solid product with solid reviews. If not Id volunteer to give it a test run and give feedback on a continual basis. I currently have the HTC One. If it was a solid product I would promote the heck out of it in my circles.,fairtrade,cq5tfgb,1,t5_2qq2a
