4584951,0,t1_ct8iv8d,Major problem is that we destroyed their normal optimal breeding habitat. The flat roofs of cities are ok for them to nest on. Even though we now reestablished their normal habitat these gulls all grew up in the city. If we kill all that live in the city we might wipe out the species. Also they can have very specific feeding sites. In our country we have one gull that breeds in the colony in the dunes but is seen every day on a city bridge  km. away. We might not like them but they are a useful and interesting species. Oh and just to be super pedantic seagulls do not exist. There are gulls that live near and off the sea but no seagulls. ,BirdsBeingDicks,ct8j7on,4,t5_2wfb6
