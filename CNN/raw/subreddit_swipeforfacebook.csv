10040149,0,t3_5j6a3p,A couple more things tapping on a notification for activity on photos takes me to the photo preview instead of the actual photo post. replying to a comments as opposed to commenting in the main comments thread leaves the text field in its editing state...but posts the reply. I know this because I kept tapping post thinking it wasnt posting but then jumped over to FB in Chrome and it shows  of the same reply over and over.Thanks!,swipeforfacebook,dbg9a7e,1,t5_3ee13

10849541,0,t3_5v34ug,Just crashes randomly for me really. Open a profile crash. See more comments crash. Go back to news feed crash. Sometimes the whole app crashes. Sometimes the app just shows a black screen where the content should be which whatever kind of page reload cant fix so I need to force close the app to fix. ,swipeforfacebook,ddz1xp7,3,t5_3ee13
