10203797,0,t3_5m1ji0,In my experience it absolutely can. It did for me in a similar situation. YMMV.Honestly the best way to get through withdrawals is just to tough it out. If you already have  days without taking any opiates just go with it. It sucks it hurts its miserable but its the price we pay. Ive yet to find a way out that doesnt include some level of discomfort and I believe Ive tried about everything at this point. It really does get better.Good luck to you! Youre doing great!,GetClean,dc0noi8,1,t5_3iag0
