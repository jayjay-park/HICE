9851492,0,t1_dar248s,People here use multiple tactics to deal with the darkest months. Very common to crunch extra vitamin D. Also pretty common to take a week down south in Europe or Thailand to load up the batteries. Working out like working out aaa looot is also good and taking long walks in the sun while the sun is up. The photo is from my  km walk yesterday D,ruralporn,daro7gc,2,t5_2teag
