And this is why I replied to your post to emphasis on your rightwrong statement. Cooking is not math. Its not false because its not in the book. Of course there are classic ways recipes trends. Thats why I mentioned Carbonara is a dish. It has a recipe and certain ingredients. Put vodka in a margarita and its no longer a margarita but its still a cocktail.

Its one thing to have those ingredients in the s but depression era US in  and  was drastically different. availability would be scarce when people couldnt barely even afford flour and chicken much less tahitian vanilla bean cardamon and clove.  and remember he drove from restaurant to restaurant selling bags of his secret recipe. he couldnt drive back to his local home town spice shop every time he needed more spice mix he stopped by the local markets bought common items mixed the spice blend in his motel room bagged it up and sold it to restaurants as a franchise.  some people have claimed that the  herbs and spices was just a marketing ploy and has been hyped to mythical marketing status with exotic ingredients but in reality very few people know and because of that lack of definity people have blown things way out of proportion.,food,cf6huvq,3,t5_2qh55

Paleo Atkins and all of the other fad diets currently popularizing the anticarb mantra are narratives built around the core medical tradeoffs of ketogenesis a metabolic process where the body compensates for a lack of blood glucose and musclestored glycogen the animal form of complex carbohydrate. Ketogenesis is adaptive not magic.While depleted of glycogen your liver is exposed to extra stress as it is forced to assist with manufacturing glucose from fats and proteins  Your body has a more difficult time producing mucus which has particularly harsh health effects for premenopausal women  Your sleep patterns may become erratic  Your immune system becomes impaired as risk of pathogenic infection increases and your body suffers from a dwindling capacity to produce compounds called glycoproteins which are vital to cellular functions  These are risks which can be managed but it is important to discard the illusion that these conditions are somehow preferred according to evolutionary biology. They are what they are.There is good evidence that dental hygiene is a modern problem stemming from a shift in bacterial ecology of the mouth since we began consuming more carbohydrates  There is not good evidence that depleting our body of carbohydrates offers any of the farreaching health benefits many socalled health gurus promise. Countless dietary decisions exist for particular purposes and lifestyles and each may be judged on its merits.

Its akin to going to a top steak house getting a well done steak and asking for steak sauce....aaaaaaand..... its  irrelevant.Its about the customer experience not what the chef or the owner thinks of your dining selection. Its arrogant as fuck and it makes me wonder if this guy went into that business because he truly loves food and wants to share it with others or if hes just looking for a vehicle to stroke his ego.That being said its highly unlikely that I would go to a fancy pizza store and put ranch dressing on their slices much as its unlikely that I would go to a top steakhouse and put A on a well done steak.... but I sure as hell wouldnt look down my nose at someone that did.If its not about the customer experience then its about the chef.

Some people will suggest a water bath but I completely avoid water near anything chocolate. If you get water in your chocolate it will seize. If this happens save this chocolate to make ganache.  Stir the chocolate between each burst. When your chocolate reaches C you have  choices.    Tabling work about  thirds of the chocolate on a clean dry marble bench until it reaches C put into a bowl then add the reserved couverture until the temperature reaches C for dark  for milk  for white. seeding add  of the weight of unmelted couverture stir until all the pieces are meted and the temperature is  . Heating the chocolate to above  melts out the crystals in the cocoa butter. When the temperature is dropped to  beta crystals form. Beta or stage  crystals are the stable form of cocoa butter crystals. When the temperature is raised to  the workings temperature it arrests the formation of more crystals. In seeding introducing the stable crystals and stirring has much the same effect.  If you live somewhere humid or it is raining use the seeding method.  Over around  humidity chocolate becomes difficult to work with. Couverture is chocolate that has a high percentage of cocoa butter. Source Im a chocolatier. ,food,chjfa3q,6,t5_2qh55

I got the shot while I was transitioning everything because I thought it looked cool but yeah coordinating cook times is always a challenge especially with grills.  The burgers did have lots of filler and I made them with a press because my burgers have a tendency to bulge in the middle and I thought more filler would stop that they tasted pretty good not quite meaty enough for my liking which is why they look kinda weird too.

Browning it in the pan first will get the insides cooked a bit more get everything gellin together like any veggies you might have put in without cooking like tomatoes or lettuce and brown the tortilla.At that point you pretty much have a ready to eat burrito. Warming it up in the oven would still help it maintain the texture slightly better but you arent trying to be Gordon Ramsay on your way to work haha.I always get a bit carried away trying to keep everything perfect but the fact is if you made the burrito yourself and froze them theyre going to taste a lot better then storebought whether you microwave or make them oven especially if you used legit ingredients,food,chmv792,0,t5_2qh55

It is an option available at some Chinese takeout places I have been to and I enjoy it. Based on that I used it as my answer to his question.

1077471,0,t1_chqpl94,I was a fresh food manager for a very large retailer and I had to undergo intensive food safety training. We had to temp everything every hour and if it was under  or coming up on  hours  it needed to be tossed. Cold foods such as deli meats mayonnaise based salads egg tuna potato cole slaw etc. need to be kept under  degrees because it will increase the risk of a food borne illness. Health departments will check for that temperature range as well and you can easily fail your inspection if your holding temperatures are not correct.I was told during food safety training that the most common causes for foodborne illnesses are cross contamination and improper holding temps. ,food,chqrfrv,1,t5_2qh55

I remember though we had some weird pizza that was basically two slices stuck together cheese to cheese. it basically looked like this I remember it costing like  a slice which isnt necessarily expensive but I find it a bit shameful that they are selling things above cost. I really looked forward to buying that though.in the scheme of things nobody really complained or expected anything better. i dont really think anybody expected real hot food to be cooked by the lunch staff or even food that was particularly fresh. I dont remember anybody really talking about it. we just got crap that even fast food restaurants wouldnt serve. there was also snacks and ice cream bars available.most kids brought their own lunches anyway. when pizza or something like that was available it was oddly kind of a treat that wed buy even if we packed our own lunches. looking back it was all so strange.,food,chzpo37,10,t5_2qh55

Most international pancake variations Ive ever had put the thick and hearty American ones to shame.The other varieties popular throughout Europe tend to be paperthin and a lot more dessertlike in flavor. This necessitates a different kind of addon that offsets or enhances the sweetness such as fresh fruit confectioners sugar or sour cream.The two most popular varieties of these style of pancakes are the French crepes and the Swedish or Nordic pancake and there are many different variations.

Stir in the lukewarm milk. Then stir in the egg yolk and melted butter. Let sit for at least  minutes or until frothy in appearance.In a large bowl whisk together the flour and sea salt. Stir the milk mixture into the flour mixture and stir until the dough just begins to come together.Place the dough on a lightly floured service and knead for  minutes or until smooth and feels just slightly damp.Place the dough in a bowl lightly oiled with olive oil. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow to rise for one hour or until doubled in size.While the dough is rising make the cinnamon swirl filling. In a small bowl use a spoon to cream together the butter sugar cinnamon nutmeg and ginger. Set aside.Preheat the oven to  degrees. Grease the bottom and sides of a  or inch castiron skillet with butter.Place the risen dough on a lightly floured surface. Knead once or twice. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a rectangleish shape about x inches in size. Use an offset spatula to spread the cinnamon filling over the dough leaving a inch border around the edges of the dough.Spread the berries on top of the cinnamon layer applying slight pressure to set them into the dough.Carefully roll the dough lengthwise into a log. Place the dough log seamside down. Use a sharp knife to cut the log in half lengthwise leaving inch attached at the top of the log. Flip each strand so that they are both berryside up. Carefully braid the strands lifting the left strand over the right until the entire length is braided together. Press the end of the braid together to seal.Join the two ends of the braid together to form a wreath pressing the ends together to seal. Use both hands to carefully place the bread into the prepped skillet.

No sauce on the filling which is usually queso cotija mixed with a bit of a Mexicanstyle onionvinegaroregano curtido then topped with shredded cabbage. Flavorwise I agree with a comment below you may be able to improve this by getting rid of the pato sauce. Enchiladas are enchiladas because they are made with chile. ,food,cjla50o,0,t5_2qh55

I think its like a one week cooler or something like that.  Those are good but break if youre using them a lot.  I destroyed enough of them to buy a yeti before I finally plumped down the cash.  If Im backpacking Ill just take a frozen steak in a ziplock.  There is nothing like a steak and a potato when everyone else is munching on freeze dried stuff.  If Im trying to impress a lady Ive got a padded container with a stiff liner that holds two bottles of wine and two wine glasses.  Funny enough an exs sister bought it for me.  Also I make my own dried food instead of buying it.  Its a lot tastier.  I make and modify my own gear with carbon fiber.  I got a huge roll of pre preg from a business that went under for tenths of pennies on the dollar so I can afford this.

If youre working with whole doves youll need to breast them which mainly involves removing the chest feathers and popping out the breast. This is a good summary video for those who are interestedRinse the breasts and pat them dry. I left them whole and didnt take the bone out. Sprinkle liberally with kosher salt and cracked black pepper garlic powder and dried shallots you can use onion powder if thats what you have on hand. Preheat oven to  degrees. Wrap dove breasts in baconyou can secure them with a toothpick but I didnt see the need it stayed pretty well. Roast for  minutes I put in this odd range because it really varies by oven you have to watch them and pull them out as soon as the bacon is crispingbrowning nicely. The bacon fat keeps the lean dove breast moist and adds a good flavor. ,food,ck7n0fe,1,t5_2qh55

In the US it has to contain a minimum of  milkfat to legally be labeled as ice cream.The fact that Scalia doesnt appear to understand that ice cream is a dairy product despite cream being right there in the name suggests that hes not a good source of educated opinions about whether something is or isnt a specific type of food.,food,ckd5gc7,3,t5_2qh55

It took me a long time to get to know them and for them to finally show me the full range of the spicy shit they eat. I never said my spice tolerance is where theirs is but its at least at the bottom of that range. They can still handle stuff thats far above my range and eat a full meal of it happily which is what theyve shown me when Ive been in there after hours drinking and all the chefs are having their meal. But I can definitely eat it without having a complete meltdown. Shits spicy as all fuck and after awhile I just have to stop because Im sweating and cant speak well but Im not eating Jalapenos and telling myself their moruga scorpion peppers or something.Everywhere else I go of course you get the average level of spice.

If someone likes their steak tender and juicy cutting it open early only prevents that....If theyre afraid of the juices looking red then cook the protein longer and let it rest properly. This is done at a restaurant because they generally take the steak off the grill early while they finish up the rest of the tables meals. Yes cutting it early lets some of the juice run however my family ate this within minutes of cutting. It doesnt dry out like a desert in seconds. While you see a lot of the juice of one of them the meat is still warm and has some clear juice.  Their meat still had some pink it just wasnt running.

2011085,0,t3_2hn3zb,Making stock  Caramelise the fuck out of the bones in the oven turn them over and caramelise the fuck out of them again.Caramelise the fuck out of your carrots onion and celery.Make sure your veg is cut nice and big as a long cooking time can cause them to break down and cloud the stock.Deglaze the shit out of the roasting tray with red wine scrape every last bit of caramelisation in the tray into the wine and add to the stockpot.I like to add more aromatics like whole black peppercorns bay leaves garlic and thyme. Start your stock with cold water.Top up with more hot water to allow even cooking as the liquid evaporates over a long cooking time.Dont skim the stock this is unnecessary to the process NEVER EVER EVER boil a stock it should be at a gentle simmer AT MOST.Cook the stock until you can see a layer of matte gelatine forming on top of the fat this is an indication that enough gelatine has been extracted from the bones and will reduce to a nice consistency for a jus this can take many hours or even days.Strain the stock through  strainers a coarse one and a fine one leaving the sediment behind.Earlier I told you to not to skim the fat from the top traditionally we are taught to skim scum and fat from a stock throughout the cooking process however this is not necessary as when we strain the stock the fat and scum rises back to the top and forms a plug of fat that seals the stock from the air and acts as a form as a preservation.To reduce to a jus you simply remove the fat plug and strain into a clean pot and boil the living fuck out of it until it is the right consistency it should coat the back of the spoon I should write a cook book one day.Edit I should mention NEVER EVER ADD SALT TO A STOCK.I cant stress this enough a stock made properly should have enough flavour to be noticeable in its final form after seasoning the product it is used in.A jus will not require added salt as once it is reduced.The use of tomato paste does not affect the flavour as it will be overpowered by more dominant flavours it is used commercially as a means of increasing the yield of a jus.,food,ckvj6pt,2,t5_2qh55

The fish I consume as in that I would be classified as a piscatarian not a carnivore which means meat eater just to clarify for you is for valuable nutrients that are difficult to get from other food stuffs and not because I dont have problems killing soulful animals so I can stuff my face with their dead flesh like the common nonquestion asking meat eater. Again not vegan never was dont want to be. I just find it immoral to consume sentient beings. As of yet fish dont display preference autonomy in the way a mammal does. So just like curt cobain I find it morally acceptable to source neccessary nutrients from a fish once in a while. Its ok to eat fish cause they dont have any feelings. I think its about time you find something else to do or someone else to bother with your misguided views. Do some research you should also watch Meet Your Meat and make better choices for yourself and the planet. After all the rate that meat is consumed in this country causes more pollution and puts more climate changing gases into the atmosphere than all of our cars trucks planes and trains combined.

Cups allpurpose flour   tsp salt or less   Cup Crisco shortening   Tbsp cold water   egg   Tbsp white vinegar  . Combine flour and salt in mixing bowl.  Add Crisco cut into peasize pieces using a pastry cutter or  knives.. Stir egg water and vinegar together in a measuring cup or glass.In a circular motion pour the entire contents onto the flour mixture.Stir with a fork until all of the mixture is moistened.. Divide the dough in half and shape each into a ball.  On a flouredpiece of parchment paper flatten the ball into a circle by pressing with the palm of your hand.  Flip the flattened ball over to flour each side.. Roll dough to a uniform thickness rolling from the centre to theedges with light even strokes.  Reshape circle and patch any tears orhole with your hands as you work.  Flour the rolling pin and surfaceas required to prevent sticking.  Occasionally loosen the pastry fromthe rolling surface with a  spatula or dull knife. I often use a second piece of parchment paper on top to keep it from sticking. If its still too sticky chill it in the fridge for  minutes. But no longer than that or it will fall apart when you roll it.  . Transfer to pie plate.  The trick to good pastry is to handle it as little as possible. When you make it into a ball dont squeeze it too hard. When youre rolling it do so gently. This will get you flakey delicious pastry.

I have friends CURRENTLY WORKING AS SERVERS.  Lets me say that again.People I hang out with on a weekly basis who are my friends who I have conversations with are servers.I have a slightly different and very educated opinion on this as I have seen them go from service job to service job stating the pros and cons of each.Stiffing is a problem.  Getting tipped low is a problem.HOWEVER  one of my friends is currently working at a place that serves food for around  a plate.  On a good weekend night my friend walks out with over .  Some nights where he really kills it and the place is hopping he makes more.Now of COURSE there are gonna be days where you come out less.  There have been plenty a months where he has struggled.  But thats the nature of the business.He has worked his way up into better restaurants.But what youre talking about is exactly what Im talking about.  You most certainly CAN pay the rent on    a person but you gotta serve a LOT of people.But lets face it.  You ARE NOT making  a person. Youre making well above that.  But Im sure it averages out to around  total.And Im telling you that MY FRIENDS never complain on  especially if its only a  check.Dont be a bitch.  Youre doing well but not every waitstaff out there is.  If everyone tipped  regardless on the tab waiters would be in good hands.  But youve worked for it.  Not every lawyer out there is working on million dollar cases  you gotta earn them.But seriously.  Dont downvote because you dont like what I have to say.

Cutting it up like that the steak will very rapidly lose temperature and it probably already bled out moisture.

2429069,0,t1_cmbxmhb,Cream is also a band.  But when referred to in the context of food it is classified as a DAIRY product.  Straight from WikipediaCream is a dairy product that is composed of the higherbutterfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In unhomogenized milk the fat which is less dense will eventually rise to the top. In the industrial production of cream this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called separators. In many countries cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets.Cream skimmed from milk may be called sweet cream to distinguish it from whey cream skimmed from whey a byproduct of cheesemaking. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty tangy and cheesy.Cream produced by cattle particularly Jersey cattle grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat this gives the cream a slight yellow tone hence the name of the yellowishwhite color cream. Cream from goats milk or from cows fed indoors on grain or grainbased pellets is white.,food,cmbxukv,-8,t5_2qh55

Well after you fill up as many shopping bags as you and your roomies can eat in a month... Pull up in the quad and make it rain!Or just drop them off at the campus food bank.This is also true of rolled oats. They sell it in huge bags at the feed store. Go in with ten people and split it up. Dried beans the man said. Buy them in  to  kilo bags and split them up. Get a buying club going on your floor for staples  rice flour beans cornmeal oatmeal ramen bricks baking powdersoda salt spices yeast bulk dried soup mix and of course zipper bags.

You want to enhance the meat flavor you have to use something that has no flavor at all but actually does enhance the flavor so just about your only option would be to add MSG to it or some shit.

Protein is being a big one but I do not think I would need it as much as men need it  not trying to be a bodybuilder.Iron Protein Creatine B vitamins. The two most important ones for you as a woman will probably be Protein and iron. You have to eat a LOT of vegetables to get to your daily recommended iron intake mg. Something like  cups of fresh spinach or  spears of asparagus..seeds are the best way to get it without consuming meat. About a cup and a half of nuts or beans should get you there...or you can use a supplement. Its the same thing with protein . gramslb of bodyweight g for the average woman which is about  tablespoons of peanut butter for some perspective. The easiest way to reach this is probably through leafy greens dairy and again...seeds. Black beans garbanzo beans pumpkinsunflower seeds...or use a supplement.  scoops of whey protein in oz of water and youve got your protein for the day for the low price of  a month. Edit Another trick for getting to your iron is to use iron cookware. It can leach considerable amounts of iron into your food.,food,cmwfhhv,1,t5_2qh55

Its even possible that youre right and that most of the Millennial generation is lazy and will never be decent employees.  However you have no way of proving the last claim so why bother allowing it to negatively effect how you view a whole generation of Americans?Its easy to pick up on the general attitude of someone you interact with.

You may have picked the sweetest apples known to man to eat that year but each tree those seeds produce will have unique characteristics. Some may be super tart others super dry. Some might have a thick skin others a paperthin skin.  To find a fruit that is tasty and satisfying to eat is extremely rare. Hass outlier tree fruits just won the lottery so to speak.

Garnished with parsley.I know I might be being a bit literal but until you put in a small pile of mixed seafood in it isnt that just tomato sauce? If you take that recipe and add red wine and bacon and mince before the tomatoes then youve got spaghetti bolognese.So I had a closer look at the wiki page and it does indeed mention that Italians would call it sugo di pomodoro or salsa di pomodoro.

2829440,0,t1_cnpogc9,Dude I was just driving home wondering is this man okay? He seems really angry when I realized that I probably drew the first unnecessary jab with the kilted Scot joke. It was definitely a joke but Ill be man enough to apologize amp not because you arent Scottish but just because it was unnecessary.But it was still a joke. Your line about dumb uncultured Americans was definitely not. And what an ignorant jab to assume that I am any of these things when you literally know nothing about me. I made a post about how I didnt particularly enjoy Scottish cuisine notably Haggis and here you are on a mighty steed proclaiming superiority over me just because youre from another country than me. I think I have an above average experience with cuisine. Im not a five star chef but my experience was that I didnt enjoy the food in Scotland. Period. And I even acknowledged my own ethnocentric bias in saying this. Also as recently as  the Scottish Government itself posted publications on becoming a Good Food Nation admitting that it was not quite there yet and it wanted to build a sustainable food and drink industry looking to outsource help. So say what you want about me and American cuisine but it looks like even the Scottish agree with me. We can have a sword fight if you want citing experiences and extol our personalities to gain the right to ride your noble steed but I dont think I was wrong in saying what I did and I do think youre being an ass.Edit and never once did I say I love McDonalds. Im into bodybuilding as a hobby. I definitely dont eat it. ,food,cnppajo,3,t5_2qh55

2834676,0,t1_cnq0tn9,They tend to stick because of the starch in the water and surrounding the pasta  this goes for lasagna more than other dried pasta because theyre more likely to be touching each other. A bit of agitation will stop this  oil isnt really helpful.  The oil is going to float on the surface of the water pretty much doing nothing.  You can test this yourself by adding some oil to a pot of water and bringing it to a boil  its still all going to stay on top of the water so theres no way its traveling down and lubricating the lasagna.Here is an article all about this.  Ill give you a quick rundown of some of the conclusions found in the article  FWIW Ive tested this all myself and I would agree with everything.This is for dried pasta only You dont need a ton of water for pasta  just enough to cover the pasta  it will release some starch which can cause sticking but if you give it a couple stirs it wont stick.  Less water is actually beneficial due to the higher concentration of starch at the end great for sauces. You dont even need a rolling boil  you can simmer the pasta or even bring it to a boil cover and turn off the heat. You can even start in cold water! You can soak pasta in water in order to hydrate and it will finish cooking in boiling water or sauce very quickly.The last point is actually beneficial for lasagna  I soak my noodles in a pan large enough to hold them until theyre pliable and then I build my lasagna.  Theyll cook just fine in the oven.,food,cnqarao,2,t5_2qh55

3077000,0,t1_cogwrk9,That is a really good analogy. And while I totally disagree that was a very interesting point. My thoughts are that we can make so many more things if we can shape the legos how we want. We could make the perfect set or make something nothing like normal lego. Same thing with GMO. We could totally change what would be normal for food. But the point should be made that this has to be tested a lot. Because like you said you could poke yourself in the eye screw up and make something harmful when you play with the building blocks of life. I say as long is there significant testing of the effects of each product made through GM then it can and will be a safe and helpful process. To clarify this goes for all types of GM artificial selection artificial reproduction and in vitro genome engineering.Edit On your last point about how you could make an AR receiver with lego biological warfare is so illegal that there would be huge international ramifications if someone were to weaponise food or use it for any sort of harm.,food,cogxfy8,0,t5_2qh55

Testing funds likely as a part of that law.  This would provide funds that academics could compete for to test not only these products but basic science related to the biological mechanisms involved.  For instance this money could be used to study the shikimic acid pathway in plants or the Bt protein.  This will fund research that otherwise would not necessarily be incentivised in either industry testing for safety or in academia for basic scientific curiosity. An outline for acceptable risks in genetic technologies to be drafted and updated by academics and scientists in industry.  Risk to human health risk to the environment risk of the transgene escaping into the wild etc. Mandatory trial reporting.

3123636,0,t3_2vxj35,Method I basically followed the Traeger website brisket to a T. The only thing I changed was the rub. My wife and son find equal parts salt and pepper a little spicy so I used a quarter cup salt two tbsp course ground pepper one tbsp smoked paprika one tbsp garlic powder and a teaspoon of white sugar. I left the entire fat cap on and just scored the thicker parts of fat. The night before I applied the rub I dont think you can apply too much... wrapped it tightly in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge over night. Early in the morning I turned the smoker on the smoke setting and left the brisket for  hours while I went back to bed. After  hours I turned the smoker up to  and inserted a meat thermometer. DO NOT REMOVE THE MEAT THERMOMETER UNTIL YOU ARE SLICING UP THE BRISKET TO EAT. YOU WILL LOSE ALL OF YOUR PRECIOUS JUICES!!! After the internal temp hit  about three hours I wrapped it in tin foil leaving the thermometer exposed and put it back in at . I left that for about an hour until the internal temperature hit  and wrapped it in another layer of aluminum foil. I wrapped all of that in a beach towel and stuck it in a cooler for  hours. While that sat I made collard greens potato salad cornbread with honey butter and a chocolate mousse pie. Happy Valentines Day . I then sliced it up and ate it. I used the diamond slicing method which is basically slicing all four corners so as to get manageable pieces of meat. My wife and one year old approve. ,food,colri32,5,t5_2qh55

Add in  cups of chicken stock. Cook on lowermiddle rack at F for about  hours.Pull it out put your oven on mega broil and put the chunks on the biggest foillined sheet pan you have. I used a full sheet pan and it fit with room for the deliciousness that we are about to smother the meat in to caramelize. I guess you could use two smaller ones and do this in batches. Break the pieces into  smaller pieces but not too small. Use your best judgement that your parents encouraged you to. Strain the liquid from the cast iron into a small saucepan put all that liquid back into your cast iron and boil on high for about half an hour until it gets syrupy. This takes a while but youll see it when it happens. All those onions and garlic and orange pieces go in the small pan dont forget to remove the bay leaves. Leave that on mediumlow to caramelize.That liquid should be syrupy by now. I found that the fat mostly came together in a solid foamy puck and I was able to just skim it out. Put your alreadyripped pork chunks back into the sauce and carefully fold them in. Get em good and wet then use some tongs to pull them out and put them back onto that big pan we talked about. Make sure they have enough room to get crusty. Broil for about  minutes shake the pan turn em over broil for  more minutes.Put all that goodness on a warmed up tortilla made by a native Spanish speaker I beg you and go to town.

There is some danger involved however when heating pans treated with PTFE to very high temperatures. When heated to over  degrees Celsius   degrees Fahrenheit a temperature you wont likely reach intentionally on your stove or in your oven PTFE can break down and release a chemical called perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA. ,food,cpcwyvt,2,t5_2qh55

He always softboiled the eggs and ate them throughout the day. He kept a careful record egg by egg of the number ingested each day. The nurse at the retirement home confirmed the daily delivery to him of approximately two dozen eggs.

Its ruinous of most recipes.Joe Bastianich said Its made by perfumists. Its garbage olive oil with perfume added to it and its very difficult to digest. Its bad for you. Its bad for New Yorkers.

3792265,0,t1_cqo9b4y,Its really simple.Lets say you start out at heat tolerance . Then theres a good chance you enjoy say spiciness level  because as other people have said it releases endorphines. But then if you do that a lot youll reach heat tolerance  and the spiciness level  dish will taste like a spiciness  dish did to you at the start. But you want the endorphines again so you eat something with spiciness level  to get the same effect again. And after you eat that a lot youll reach heat tolerance  and youll need  for the same effect. Repeat ad nauseum. Id say its a negative thing though. The issue is that once youre at say level  youre going to have trouble finding stuff that you find spicy youll need to buy something especially marketed as super spicy. Id much rather be at  again where you can order a spicy dish and enjoy the spice instead of not noticing it at all.,food,cqojrao,1,t5_2qh55

Yes  technically both are a form of genetic modification  but one involves the public consuming dangerous levels or carcinogenic chemicals.  Also  its a fallacy that GMO food will put a dent in world hunger.  There is plenty of food grown every year to feed the world  the problem is not on the supply side  it is a lack of accessibility of poor countries that cant grow enough food for their country to acquire food from other countries.

Of course there are certain limitations but with the right kind of for example sponge cake and filling for static and a ganache for sealing you can make gorgeous and tasty cakes without problems. If the cake has many tiers you use rods that are inserted in the cake to hold the upper tiers  und every tier sticks to a board so they dont sit right on the cake.Fondant itself tastes just sweet so I just dont eat it. ,food,cqz3g22,2,t5_2qh55

Your inability to read doesnt mean you should jump into the comments and restate without elaboration the exact position the link just spent multiple pages demolishing. Foods made before modern processing often tasted terrible. Even the rawest of foods you eat now has been processed in a way that premodern people would see as witchcraft and that significantly improves its edibility. Most people  who lived before the th century were and we have ludicrous amounts of evidence for this ravaged by horrifying nutritional deficiencies are completely unheard of in the developed world. Calorie density is a problem the same way ugh I have too many shoes and I cant pick which ones to wear is a problem and has the same solutionbuy fewer shoes eat less. Its also not a great comparison to draw when the idyllic past food luddites are calling on featured regular famines where people literally starved to death for lack of any food calorie dense or otherwise. Our current food culture is far from perfect but acting as if the solutions are to be found by recreating our agricultural past is starryeyed naivete at best and snake oil salesmanship see Diets Paleo at worst. ,food,crhsr21,5,t5_2qh55

4104253,0,t1_cro2t0w,Yeah thats about right. Also cut thickness and marinade can mak a big difference in final dryness. If its cut super thin from a decently marbled cut with a high salt brine it will dry a lot more than a leaner thicker less seasoned cut. Time spent drying is another good control. Ive used Alton Browns furnace filter  fan method several times and found it adequate if labor intensive. Tip cut your meat into big working chunks and leave them in the fridge or freezer even to keep it cold and firm while cutting. Or just get your butcher to do it.,food,cro3yhx,2,t5_2qh55

4214461,0,t1_cs0hqzz,I live in Japan so I kind of get to eat all the ridicously good meat in Japan seriously even at the supermarket.About wagyu Its kind of a hyped meat for example the burgerstore I usually attend to  the best Ive ever been to offers wagyu beef for only  Yen about  more. It tastes good but I doubt that it is the most high quality wagyu haha.But on the other hand you can get really really good wagyu. Ive eaten a shabushabu pick very very thin sliced meat pour it through hot oil for only  or  seconds and then eat it without spices or egg or sesame sauce or whatever and it was so so so so good. It dissolved as soon as it touches the tongue and the fat carried the flavor and it spreaded in my whole mouth and woa. But yea the bill came paid about g so the bill was about  in the end with me and my gf and we still were hungry afterwards haha. Needless to say it was A and just like in the picture.Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Yes if you can afford it. Can post a picture if interestedEDIT Nevermind I post it anyways.

I was very disappointed and would not order it again. The richness of the fat  meat was overwhelming and after eating half the steak I had about enough. They also chose not to season it  I guess to let the meat stand on its own. This did not help.

Fair enough if you like your own style I just take offence to the idea that an IPA is meant to be a nasty onedimensional trip to Bleach Town. IPA is meant to have a balance of malt and hops with the slight increase in ABV making it last longer. Its not meant to be some fucking Lagunitas Brown Suggah catastrophe.Anyway now Im at my keyboard I have tried about half that list but scores more off it each proudly proclaiming its IPA status. I could say yes or no to each name you could throw at me but my memory isnt good enough to rattle off a list of my own without going to the beer aisle and looking at labels sorry.IN other news I loved going to HEB in Texas.

Slowly stir the eggs into each other. Keep stirring them while keeping the heat as low as possible  removing from heat from time to time. Add pieces of butter slowly to avoid excessive temperature bumps. Remove from heat when it starts to look like its getting ready and the latent heat in the pot will finish them off.

4508299,0,t1_csyvt4t,I apologize thisgt this is never ever done. Its never even a thought.threw me off. I just see in this thread so many people saying that food tampering is a myth and that all cooks have huge amounts of self restraint but you cant generalize because of your own experiences. Ive seen this first hand on more than one occasion and because I try and warn people about it I get downvoted. I know there are more cookschefs that will never think about tampering with food but you cant assume that every cookchef has that kind respect for other people. The guys that did this that I worked with did not care about the job and were only there to make a paycheck because no other job would hire them. Im sure as a cookchef you can completely see how the pressure of the job could break a weaker willed person to the point they would do something stupid. Ive seen guys so rushed they put their hands into the fryer or cutting another person with a knife because they forget for a second they were holding it. This kinda work is incredibly taxing and for someone who has no passion for it and does it just to get by would not have as much restraint as someone who actually cares. Cooks have and will spit in your food you shouldnt think for a second that the people handling your food will take any and all abuse you give them without reaching a breaking point and hocking a loogie in your sauce. It sucks to think about but its true. Like I said I know these people are in the minority but it really does happen and its almost scary to see so many people with rose colored glasses deny it and claim it is some kinda urban legend.,food,csyx5d2,1,t5_2qh55

Otherwise it would be written as Jaozi which is the pinyin official spelling. Its pronounced the same as the Shangdon spelling which is Giaozi which is where Gyoza comes from. Seeing as how Japanese culture mostly comes from Chinese culture people emigrating you could pretty much say a lot of Japanese words are derived from chinese ones. Kanji in the written language is pretty much adopted Chinese logographic characters. Anyways all this bullshit is just technical stuff. In the culinary world gyoza refers to the s Japanese dumpling. ,food,ctvjwjl,1,t5_2qh55

I got a quarter jackfruit last summer and spent basically half an hour just trying to pry some of the edible bits out.  The rest rotted in the fridge because I really couldnt be bothered to spend another half hour to pry a couple more bits.  And it didnt taste any better than the stuff you get in cans anyway in syrup not in brine  the brined jackfruit tastes like nothing.Unless youre going to go to the enormous trouble of taking out the edible bits and actually making a dish out of it as opposed to eating it by itself Id recommend canned jackfruit.  Its absolutely delicious.It smells great by the way but some people really dont like the smell.  My wife is one of them.  To me its delicious.  This is in contrast to the durian which smells fucking terrible to literally everyone.  Literally.  Even people without a sense of smell and dead people.  Even people who claim to like it are in reality just masochists.  Such is the smell of the king of fruits the durian.  But jackfruit no its quite pleasant.,food,ctwa4yr,-1,t5_2qh55

4818784,0,t1_cu1x5mz,Spring rollsPan sear grounded pork and set to the side in a big bowl. Then pan sear cabbage onions and garlic until the cabbage turns sweet and soft. Season with fish sauce brown sugar soy oyster sauce sweet chili and chili flakes. Boil water and soak rice noodles for two minutes. Drain the noodles and mix all ingredients together in the big bowl. If the mix is very hot let it cool for a while. Other wise start rolling the spring rolls. I use frozen sheets and let them thaw in the unopened package which I wrap in a kitchen towel. It takes longer to thaw but decreases the risk of the sheets sticking together. Fill a pan with approx. one and a half centimeters of rapeseedoil and set the heat to  or what corresponds. When the oil is  degrees Celsius drop the springrolls carefully into the oil. Fry for  minutes per side. Drain the excess oil on a paper towel and fry them for  seconds again. Drain once more. Perfectly crunchy! ,food,cu1y40n,5,t5_2qh55

Coppa comes from a muscle that runs across the upper back of the pig behind its neck  in American butchery it is just included in the two shoulder cuts on either side. But in Italian butchery it is more likely that the whole longitudinal coppa muscle will be removed whole because it can be dry cured whole to create delicious coppa.

Sorry I dont know says above but would add one step. I would deglaze that cast iron skillet either with a little bit of the stock your going to use or a little water or wine and add that liquid and the brown bits to your crock pot. Then Id just set the show cooker on its the auto setting go to work and come home to delicious beef stew.One thing I have not done is make dumplings in a crock pot stew. Even on the high setting Im not sure I could get a rapid enough boil quickly enough to cook the dumplings. The thing to remember uvcanka is that most stew recipes are very forgiving. If you get your flavor profile and seasonings right and give it adequate time to cook and tenderize the meat youre going to end up with delicious results.

4916357,0,t1_cue81rm,Its pretty easy to keep to a vegan diet. You can eat a lot. I had BBQ bacon burgers last night. Most meateaters would probably like the sound of that. Its hard to be picky on a vegan diet. Or any diet where you by its nature restrict types of foods e.g. a person on a paleo diet who doesnt eat vegetables or meat is gonna have a bad time.Veganism is less a diet than it is a lifestyle that aims to reduce animal cruelty and harm. So I think its perfectly acceptable to make a choice that you think is morally right and do then do what you can to make choices that stay within that moral frame. So you either tell people in advance and hope they can accommodate and if they cant you just bring your own food. Its not hard.,food,cue8t5h,47,t5_2qh55

4920790,0,t1_cuesnwh,I dont think there are any mental gymnastics at all really.A significant proportion of grain over half the grain in the US  of corn and over  of soy or  worldwide is fed to animals that are raised as meat. So yes when you eat some bread numerous mice and other small creatures would have died in the harvesting of that grain.But when you eat meat the animal e.g. cow sheep pig is dead as well as all the animals killed in farming the grain. Far more animals die in the production of meat than just the animals we eat. So if youre concerned about all the animals dying in the harvesting of grain its actually still more ethical to eat bread and other grainbased products than eat meat as when you eat meat you support both the killing of that animal and animals that die in the farming of the grain to feed the farmed animals.Also see this article from TIME magazine.,food,cuesylc,1,t5_2qh55

Some hops will almost purely bitter a beer sure but there is a pretty wide variety of hops and theyre being used in so many cool and interesting ways these days.The current trend really rather than big bitter alcoholic monsters the classic example of this was Stones Ruination is the usage of new hop varieties that tend to focus way more on tropical and citrus fruit flavors and floral aromas. ,food,cuoibo9,2,t5_2qh55

I did a sampling of my gumbo recipes and the stock to roux ratio varies from  to  all the way up to  to .  So you have a lot of flexibility there.  Personally I like it more to the lower ratio end of the scale. A roux made with  cup flour and  cup oil yields about   cup of finished roux.Darker roux gives more flavor but it gives less thickening power than a lighter roux.You could make the roux in a separate pan and then add in to the separatelycooked stock and vegetables until you get the flavor and thickness you want.I also like to finish with a little chopped parsley chopped green onions and a touch of lemon juice.,food,cuswan8,2,t5_2qh55

If you just leave plain milk sitting out it naturally has a certain diverse mix of microbes from just being exposed to the environment the longer it sits the more populated the milk gets. The reason that spoiled milk is bad for you is because the initial mix of bacteria had a mix of some good and some bad bacteria and all thing being equal they probably grew at a similar rate meaning one type didnt win out over another. When you add your own culture you are controlling which bacteria is being put in the milk and with such a large head start the good bacteria quickly out numbers any bad bacteria leaving less food for them to consume and thus reproduce.,food,cuzpbj4,2,t5_2qh55

5317730,0,t1_cvrdy8p,gt  CopyMeThat seems like a really great app if you have a pretty good idea of some specific site to go search or a blog you regularly follow but our app is trying to take things the other way  someone with maybe a vague idea of what they would like to put together can get a recipe really quickly and get on to dinner.CopyMeThat also fills this need. In addition to looking at the recipes you have added to your CMT recipe book you can also use the community tab to look at the recipes others have added which are searchable by username ingredient and text in the recipe.gt . Just to clarify a bit here Im talking about hooking up our backend to a recipe API like the ones I mentioned and basically drawing on them for our stash of recipes. Alternately Im talking about a really simple formtype page inside the app where you can quickly type out a recipe with drop downs for units autonumbering instructions etc.If users cant add their own recipes while using the app I think its going to get stale fast. Also considering this is an app I will likely be using on my smart phone I dont want to have to type in each ingredient click a bunch of drop downs and what have you.I mean it sounds like you have an idea that might speak to a certain type of audience. I would highly suggest you play around with CopyMeThat for a while  the webapp is fantastic the mobile app still needs a little work. gt The crummy recipes issue is one that I think everyone struggles with a bit. At least initially the recipes weve are subjectively good ones. I had a situation come up this week where a recipe I used didnt come out as good as I thought it should be and with a couple of clicks I was able to alter the amountstypes of ingredients and the directions for my recipe so I dont make that mistake again. I think functionality like this is very important also something difficult to do with a standard cookbook.,food,cvrehu4,2,t5_2qh55

Reason being is because they usually dont have all of those stuff hidden in the back. They might have a few items but not as much as what the real places have. And the things they do have is for themselves for lunch and dinner. Theres also at least  people so they tend to try and make only what they need to. My parents own restaurant and have only cooked something for someone else twice and it was because they were friends. They have also cooked stuff for my sisters husband friendsfamily but it was because she was there and because she brought the ingredients herself. I work with a different Chinese restaurant and we had people request off menu stuff but we reject them because of lack of ingredients and because its not something they do.,food,cwrks41,1,t5_2qh55

The rise of mass consumption and prepackaged everything meant you no longer needed the skill of cooking to thrive or even to be thrifty. It took nearly half a century for any kind of revulsion to it all to set in with the general public and by then youve had two generations completely removed from this sort of thing. This is why hipsters are so stereotypically into things like pickling crafted things and the general concept of authenticity. Theyve grown up in a mass produced culture devoid of any meaning to them so theyre pursuing the pursuits of years past. ,food,cwu9030,10,t5_2qh55

I remembered it being tasty but what the hell did I know about chocolate at  years old? Went back recently because I was delighted by remembering the fact that they had a LARGE chocolate waterfallriver all decked out like a big mountain. Anyways being a brazen adult I decided that I was going to dip a finger in and taste the chocolate. So while all the grumpy little old bitties who worked in the store were busy gossiping about another co worker I dipped a meaty digit into the molten brown goo and stuck it into my mouth. Gigantic. Grievous error. Not only was what was in there probably not food safe but it was probably not edible either. It tasted like Diarreah and subsequently also gave me diarreah. Never again shit fountain.

Spam and Tofu are almost complete opposites.  Spam has a lot of flavor but the flavor is very unbalanced.  Just salt fat and pork.  It works best with foods that will accept those flavors.  Tofu also needs some love and attention to taste good but its flavor profile is almost nonexistent.  It also works best combined with other foods for the opposite reason.  ,food,cwvbg8m,1,t5_2qh55

5796813,0,t1_cxf8yjo,Yes when we or our daughter werent comfortable with the consistency as it was wed smush with a fork or cut in small bits or if the food was too liquid like soup or yogurt wed spoon feed.Were not against purees per se the main point is to not stress about making anything different for baby or even plan ahead but work with what is already at the table on a case by case basis. Practical example Apple slices could indeed pose a choking hazard as they are crisp enough for gums to break but too hard for a beginner chewer. So at first wed cut into paper thin slices a little challenging but still easy to grasp or offer just a whole partially peeled apple. Over time our daughter got better at chewing and not gagging on bits so the slices got bigger. But we never stopped her from eating apples with the rest of the family nor did we limit her to applesauce which btw makes an excellent on the go snack especially in pouches.Lazy parenting FTW!  ,food,cxfndtc,1,t5_2qh55

5842833,0,t1_cxliihk,I just think everybody should be aware of your food and how its processed and whatnot. Sending it to a butcher to have them do your dirty work is really just putting blinders on to the whole thing. If you are that attached to this animal I see no difference between putting it down yourself verses having somebody else do it for you.Also and im not speaking about the OP persay as I dont know him or his intentions. But what about this really makes these pigs pets in the same manner as a cat or dog? If he named them pig  pig  and pig  would that make it easier? If he didnt build a nice pasture for them and put them in a more morbid setting like most mass producing slaughterhouses do would that change things? The fact that you treat your food humanely and raise them in a nice setting to try and emulate a humane setting as best as you can is absolutely the proper thing to do. The meat at your supermarket comes from animals treated like pure shit up until they die. If it wasnt all dollars and cents this humane situation would absolutely be the proper way to conduct this business but unfortunately thats not the reality.All n all I just think if seeing things like this sicken you so much that you want to stop eating meat I absolutely understand and thats perfectly fine. But turning a blind eye to how these animals are procecssed as food simply so you can skip right to eating it without thinking about isnt the way to go about it and people who find this sickening all the while cooking up a slab of bacon for breakfast each morning is pretty hypocritical IMO.But thank you for a very respectable reply and not just jumping into an argument! And just for the record Im not saying if you cant kill an animal yourself then you are hypocritical when eating meat procecssed by others. Because personally I couldnt even do what the OP did myself however I absolutely applaud how he handles the situation in the most humane manner possible!,food,cxlisn3,1,t5_2qh55

Place milk sugar and yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle. Wait  to  minutes for mixture to foam proof. Stir in eggs  cup olive oil salt red pepper flakes cornmeal and   cups bread flour.. Switch to dough hook and stir in  cups bread flour. If needed gradually add enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Knead on low speed  minutes or until dough is smooth and elastic. Coat bowl with  teaspoon olive oil and place dough in bowl. Cover and let rise  hour.. Gently deflate the dough and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Cover with bowl and let rest  minutes.  Line two  x  loaf pans with parchment leaving a  overhang brush parchment with  tablespoon of the softened butter.. In a small bowl stir  tablespoons butter and garlic together. Divide dough in half. Roll each portion into a rectangle  x .  Brush half of the butter onto each rectangle. Evenly top with half the cheese and half the chiles.. Using a sharp knife cut the dough crosswise into six   x  strips. Carefully stack the strips on top of one another. Cut the stack into six  x   pieces.. Turn the dough pieces on edge cut edges up and place them in the pan one in front of the other. Squares should be standing up. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover pans with greased plastic wrap and allow to rise until nearly doubled about  hour.. Near the end of the rise preheat oven to F. Bake  to  minutes.

6237223,0,t1_cyyanj8,Yeah you can put hot food into pyrex but with glass the dangerous thing is vast temperature changes very quickly. The reason the glass breaks is it expands at different rates I.E. the center is cold while the part touching food is red hot and it cracks.So it would be highly ill advised to put pyrex into the freezer then immediately take it out and put something boiling into it it may break even pyrex. The thicker the glass the higher the chance of catastrophic failure the thinner much less.Also it is a good idea to let it cool down before washing it in very cold water.,food,cyyls22,2,t5_2qh55

6263742,0,t3_41e92s,Loosely based off this recipe The capellini is hand made using KitchenAid tools.  Instead of the cheddar cheese I used mozzarella and parmesan cheese to keep it more Mediterranean.   I made a red pepper sauce with roasted red peppers crushed red pepper olive oil and balsamic glaze.  It was delicious and was very nice upon the egg.I think next time I do this dish I will make the nests separate from the eggs.  I will poach the eggs and then place it in the nests.  That will give me more control over the eggs doneness.  I think that it was too easy to overcook the egg.  By the time the whites had set the yoke was firming up not my preferred texture.Overall the dish was pretty and tasty.

So my boyfriend and I got into an argument over the spaghettis recipe... He argued that my spaghetti was TOO eggy! and that it reminds him of lomein which turned into another argument about Chinese noodles.. haha.. my recipe used  whole egg   egg yolks. This was what Ive always thought homemade pasta was suppose to be. More yolks to whole eggs. What are your thoughts????Here is my full recipeMake Pasta for  large portions g semolina fl. g bread fl  whole egg   egg yolksfor the sauce  eggs   egg yolks whisked together with C finely grated parmesan and  tsp cracked black pepper set asidein a pan cook pancetta with  tbsp olive oil until crispy.meanwhile boil pasta.

Once it was cashews which I am allergic to but not anaphylactic.. I do the wipe down my seat thing and if anyone near me happens to have brought food from home that I cant eat i usually just explain my situation and they put it away.

If youre having trouble getting the spices fine enough a little bit of coarse salt in with the spice will give it some grit and help you get a finer grind provided youre final recipe calls for salt. Its really better not to grind up your spices too far in advance. After grinding spices start to lose flavors and aromas fairly quickly. Freshly ground or freshened up with a quick pulse in the grinder right before you use them will give you a much tastier rub. ,food,czjbak1,1,t5_2qh55

And if you order anything they dont approve of American Chinese Vietnamese the rest of your meal is also inferior.

Medium saucepan with a tight fitting cover  Alton Browns perfect rice recipe and  minutes is all you need.  I made two batches of riceland and tossed the lb bag.

The first visit after they came to check on us they said Oh just order it Indian spicy next time.The next time we did so and it could have still be a bit hotter so the guy just said hed remember us. The third time they finally started getting the food hot enough but it had also become a bit of a competition so we didnt admit it. By the th time foods that were normally yellowishorange were now almost red with pepper. The other cook who didnt take our order and didnt know us was peaking from out of the kitchen to watch us eat the food. Eventually the servercook comes up and gives us a little back story. Well I just came to see if there were flames coming from your bottom. I only know one man who eats food like you guys and hes from Africa. When I was making your food normally I put one scoop for mild two for spicy  or  for really really spicy. I was on the seventh scoop of pepper when the cook panicked and thought I was messing up the food. I told him no no watch theyll eat it!While we were technically victorious in the competition that Im not sure they were aware of and I was able to eat and enjoy the food Id never intentionally order it that spicy again. ,food,d1mzo0j,19,t5_2qh55

Without wax tempering you have to keep chocolate at a super low temperature ltFltC or it starts losing its shape and melting. Also high wax content in chocolate  the chocolate is cheaper. Cool for presentation not that great for taste. Honestly even if it wasnt all wax this wouldnt look appealing to me  slabs of chocolate with whipped cream and a couple pieces of fruit arent that impressive tastewise.

7231836,0,t3_4ehp89,Here are some ideas that can be implemented independent of one another. Top them with fresh cut green cabbage for a crisp bite. I personally like cabbage for its functionality and flavor. It offers more for my health as it contains more vitamins and nutrients whereas lettuce is mostly  water.  Add fresh mayo for a tang Bake some hard shells and soft shells for a few min. Put cheese on soft shells and wrap hard shell into soft shell utilizing the cheese as the glue. Gives you a double decker Try chicken Where is your fresh onion? I like red onion chopped finely and placed on top of taco. Really gives it that bite Wheres da beans? Whole black beans or a refried bean paste for your taco shell interior Try adding a butternut squash paste to your taco shell interior as a cover. It gives it all a sweet flavor Try boiling a potato for a few min. Cut into small squares and put them on a skillet with butter to crisp them up. Can give the taco an added crisp but does add to overall carbs.One thing Ive noticed with my taco evolution is that the more I fry together the more singular the flavor is of my taco. I like fresh produce added to maintain the integrity of the flavor of that item  for example onions cabbage etc.,food,d207g5t,3,t5_2qh55

It may not in fact be a salad or I might have inadvertently elevated what started out as a simple affair to the status of a preposterous pretender. Although the Wikipedia entry for salad does seem to offer a counterpoint A salad is a dish consisting of small pieces of food which may be mixed with a sauce or salad dressing. They are typically served cold. Salads can incorporate a variety of foods including vegetables fruits cheese cooked meat eggs and grains. So small tomatoes and small onions dressed may. perhaps be a salad. Hard to say. But sorry for upsetting you.,food,d2h64nw,4,t5_2qh55

7392719,0,t3_4gju5q,I think something went horribly wrong here....This is soooo wrong! For starters the curry is supposed to be a main component of the dish not a sauce drizzled like light salad dressing. It should be hearty and rich like a stew preferably with large chunks of carrots celery and potatos.The Kastu should be over the rice and half submerged in the curry so you get the wonderful crispiness of the kastu on one end of it and the other end is moistened with the curry getting all aspects of the dish in one bite.Id say its time to go back to the drawing board with this one.

Firstly perfect in this context means to make something completely free from faults or defects make as good as possible.Google defines an egg as an oval or round object laid by a female bird reptile fish or invertebrate usually containing a developing embryo. The eggs of birds are enclosed in a chalky shell while those of reptiles are in a leathery membrane.So roundness is indeed part of the criteria for an egg and thus anything that isnt perfectly round isnt a perfect egg. The definition also stipulates that it must be enclosed in a chalky shell. This egg has been cracked and fried it doesnt even have a shell let alone a perfect one D,food,d2oir6a,-9,t5_2qh55

While this is going I simmer a mixture of  whole milk and  heave cream on the stove for about  minutes. Once that is done it is very slowly poured into the kitchen aid with the yolks and sugar mix which should now be huge and fluffy while still spinning so that it incorporates. This mixture then gets put back into the stove for another  minutes at a simmer to finish pasteurizing. Basically thats how to both emulsify and pasteurize. Once this is done I take my ice cream base and fridge it until cool couple hours. Once cool I whisk in my flavoring. My favorite flavor to make is maple brown sugar. I whisk together.  cup of maple syrup  tbsp brown sugar and a pinch of salt and whisk that into my gelato base.

We arent exactly a health forum. gt  its in EVERYTHING WHEN IT DOESNT NEED TO BE!!!!Whether it is necessary is certainly subjective. Professional chefs will tell you that the defining differences between a professional chef and an amateur home cook are the usages of . Butter and . Salt. Home cooks use both very sparingly because they are afraid to make something too salty or too unhealthy which is understandable but this is why many home versions of restaurant meals never taste like the real thing.Either way I think youd have an argument that butter doesnt need to be melted into a squirt bottle and squirted during the cooking process of every single thing we make like they do in restaurants.. but I dont really think you can argue that the recipe for buffalo sauce shouldnt be the recipe for buffalo sauce because it contains butter.

Regular pancakes as theyre eaten all over Europe and many other parts of the world are made in a normal pan with batter that isnt quite as runny and is typically spread in the pan just by moving the pan around or by letting gravity do its thing.

It was inferno in NY  he ordered wings and wanted them to make them garlic parmesean with another flavour that they serve also mixed in  I cant remember what rhe other flavojr was but it was something simple on the menu  they refused to do it and they refused to give him sauce he wanted mixed in on the side which is also something they usually do.  My only guess is the wings are frozen premades with the sauce already on them because I have no idea why they wouldnt be able to do it. Im gonna text him and see what rhe other flavour is. Super late edit The other sauce was just there Mild hot sauce.,food,d3n3p8a,4,t5_2qh55

Theres no way to guarantee you wont get sick there never really is with anything but you can count on a chefrestaurant with a good reputation to keep you safe. Ive eaten raw fish and oysters tons of times and raw beef a handful of times. Ive gotten slightly sick from meals that had raw seafood but its hard to say what actually made me sick it could just have easily been improperly handled vegetables meat or whatever but never anything severe. The two times I have ever had sever illness from food was from cooked foods that just were not handled and stored properly.If you want to try raw fish do a little research and find a sushi place that is popular and has a good reputation ask around use the various rating sites that are out there ask a hotel concierge etc. It doesnt have to be expensive but dont go to a super cheap collegetype joint. Go at a time that is busy but not slammed like an early afternoon weekday lunch. Bring a friend that likes and knows sushi well and ideally knows your preferences a little and have them help you order. Or just ask the chef and server for some recommendations. My girlfriend had never had sushi and thought she didnt like fish before we met. Her friend and I took her to a good sushi restaurant for dinner ordered a variety of dishes for her to try and shes been hooked ever since. ,food,d4e0dp9,1,t5_2qh55

8051055,0,t1_d4kuw79,Oh okay thanks!Here it goes you start by buying fresh duck and like  litres of duck fat. Melt the fat so its gently simmering. In the meanwhile you season the duck legs with salt and pepper and sear it good on a cast iron. When its seared you drop them in the pot of simmering duck fat for  hours. When its done remove the legs from the pot and it should fall apart very easily. the rest is simple I sauted mushrooms in a pan until soft and a little browned. Then I had the veal stock I buy it from my butcher fresh veal stock not the powder thing.i had about  cup of stock. Then I let this summer until it thickens. I add the cream. Let this thicken a bit more and then I play with my fresh pasta goat cheese and chives and the delicious duck confit on top. Voila! Sorry if its not clear...

8264461,1,t1_d5akj90,Okay well bake them once smoke a bowl then bake em again. I dunno but what I do know is that its not that hard and people can use google. Everyone here is like WHAT IS THE RECIPE as if this guy invented something brand new that no one has ever tasted or feasted their eyes upon.He didnt reinvent the wheel. Hell he didnt even buy new rims or rotate the tires. Just added the spinny hubcap. Simple recipe. Simple meal. Great taste. Cooking food is very simple but cooking simple food is the hardest thing you can do. I remember one time I was communicating with this cute girl from school and I would send her pictures of what Id prepare in the kitchen. Shed always compliment my dishes and say shed love to try one. I invited her over one day and rather than making a simple dish like Ive done time and time again I tried to make something overly complicated. I ended up making this complicated dish that came out well but not great. She liked it. I never did know if she was just saying that but she did finish everything I served and then some. We talked and had some glasses of wine. Then it was time to say goodbye. We conversed actively for the weeks that followed but nothing ever came to fruition. Being a big believer of the butterfly effect I wondered what would have happened if I kept it simple stupid. It was almost as if I was channeling my inner Michael Scott. I could have made a simple dish like I usually did for dinner only more portions so she could eat as well. Instead I treated it like a big occasion and date mike came out and it didnt go as well as it could have in the kitchen. Later on after a drunken night of young adult debauchery I made breakfast for everyone over my flat. I kept it simple. Eggs bacon and home fries. Made enough for  people and there was more than enough to go around. We watched early morning football and everyone loved the food. They asked where I learned to cook and how I made such a simple dish so well. I was happy to hear it but then I wondered. What if I had made brinner for her? In life our best laid plans dont always come to fruition. They say if you want to make God laugh tell him your plans. I told him I wanted to make a restaurant quality dish and he said you can only make a single Michelin star dish. TL DR So maybe instead of baking the potato twice...you keep it simple and only do it once. ,food,d5am5kt,2,t5_2qh55

Then Italian immigrants since the ingredients were so cheap who  moved to the US started making them with cheese and toppings thats why when you have AmericanItalian food the portions are huge because everything was so cheap.Also there are better rated pizza places in the US than in Italy Zagat awarded a  higher than almost any pizzeria in Naples Italy rating to a small pizza place in Trenton New Jersey in a dangerous neighborhood if that gives you perspective.

If not there you could try an ethnic market Asian Hispanic Middle Eastern as they usually sell spices in that way.Edit Keep in mind you dont have to buy in bulk the whole point of this section is just that you arent paying for the packaging since the spices themselves come in big bags and then are usually transferred to reusable containers by the staff.

My partner and I are so in awe of a few of the dishes at our favourite two places in SYD that we tried to find equivalents all over BKK  dining at Sorento sp? for  for a couple and dining at buttfuck nowhere sp? where we found a locally loved place and packed this time without any other tourists for  a head including fresh orange juice and between all dished we had in our month there nothing came close we ordered the same dishes or aspiring analogues. The chicken and vegetable quality and freshness the rice noodles the quality of the oil. It all adds up.   We are also not used to the Western Thai food  no thats not the thing here because  places in Sydney for Thai arent as good as the top  we had in BKK. The places here are just better sometimes  fresher ingredients for one!       The problem with BKK was outside of some rare establishments we could not find a middle ground. We found cheap places for  a head that didnt come close to matching the places in Sydney  a head  where is OP paying ? but then we dined at a few places that were  a pop. We didnt find enough in the baht range  au.       I guess in that country youre either scrapping against others for local loyalty or saying to yourself well I might as well keep raising the prices since these people are not going to walk out of the door back into the searing heat.

Cook til the peppers are soft green bell peppers color will fade a bit best way to know theyre done. Make sure you stir periodically so the onions cook evenly. Then clear some space in your pan cook the steak with a little butter for extra flavor melt cheese on top once is cooked through. Throw it all on a roll and enjoy. ,food,d6kl7f8,1,t5_2qh55

9190217,0,t1_d8gifmt,When I first looked at the picture I thought the exact same thing and that would be the case at just about any other fast food burger shop but InNOut condiments are to exception to the rule. Fast food veggies are typically slimy hot and definitely not fresh. InNOut purposely has slow company growth so they can make sure the quality of the ingredients are top quality across all their locations. My first job was at one of the most busiest InNOuts right by the Long Beach airport and starting pay was . and made several raises within the  years I was there which was amazing for  years old me at the time. They kept the temperature of the lettuce just right so it was cool crispy and fresh even on a hot burger. The condiments are just as good as the burger its self when it comes to InNOut. I absolutely love getting a burger proteinstyle where they wrap the burger in nice big pieces of crispy lettuce instead of a bun. Seriously try it before you knock it. TLDR InInOut condiments are seriously off the chain ,food,d8gxe9e,-2,t5_2qh55

I used pecorino in addition to parmesan added more water and added the eggcheese at a later point of time yielding a creamier sauce. Overall we were satisfied. I will continue to add the extra egg yolk in the future. I wish photos could transport flavor. I personally like the cone presentation  Ill stick to it. ,food,d8zm11r,21,t5_2qh55

9341672,0,t3_58g2h2,Im italian and im exposing my personal thought as an italian.The problem with pineapple pizza is that it is not tipically italian in term of flavour.Italian food follows quite some empirical rules which come from years of history and are hard to break.there are many flavours in italian cousine and sometimes they overlap but as a rule of thumb there are some specific flavors which you cannot mix. two of them as an example could be salty and sweet. In italian cousine the sweet flavour is quite completely segregated at the end of the meal. adding sweet elements in other courses is possible under very SPECIFIC conditions.moreover pineapple is not a typical plant here in Italy and it wouldnt be a problem per se but this often means that you would use a not well ripe pineapple or worse a canned pineapple which is even sweeter...You know...  you may see us italians as foodNazi but the truth is that every nation has some sort of foodNazism... even about foreign food!!since Ive studied exactly this i can say that for example you cannot sell just a random kind of lasagna in France or England not even true italian lasagna! thats because it wouldnt be perceived as lasagna and no one would buy them. said that if you want to eat hawaian pizza  please help yourself. ,food,d904hf8,3,t5_2qh55

An easier way to cut and separate them is to roll both ends towards the middle like you would for palmiers and cut then slide a chopstick or butter knife or whatever under the middle and lift them up. Gently shake to uncurl and separate the noodles. I saw this on a video on youtube a while back and it worked really well Ill try to find the source if anyones interested.,food,d925me8,2,t5_2qh55

9522460,0,t3_5ba1a0,Leftovers from some corned venison shanks I braised two nights ago. I chopped up the meat and potatoes yellow onion crisped it in some bacon grease. Topped with over medium fried eggs with generous sploots of TabascoFor the corned shanks I used Ruhlmans recipe for corned beef brine I use a bit less salt and pinksalt than he does. cups kosher salt  cup sugar  teaspoons pink salt sodium nitrite optional  cloves garlic minced  tablespoons pickling spiceI brine the shanks for about four days and then rinsesoak in fresh water for about a day to pull some of the salt back out. I then braise the shanks in bacon grease and hard cider finish with carrots onion potatoes. Much better than just grinding the shanks for sausage like I used to do.,food,d9mufpr,1,t5_2qh55

The sesame seeds make lots of smoke open a window maybeLet rest a few mins slice and serveChili mustard sauce  of Thai red peppers from the Asian market deseeded and minced  tablespoon of brown mustard  tablespoon of honey grated ginger dash of sesame oil dash of white vineagar black pepper. The Chive pancakes finely chop some garlic and med chop some scallions or chives if you prefer and mix them in a batter made of roughly  cup flour  egg tsp baking powder a splash of milk and a dash of salt. cook as you would normal pancakes.The salad Baby spinach arugula sliced apple raspberries crushed walnuts. DressingEVO white wine vinegar muddled raspberries black pepper. Caprese Pretty simple caprese just added prosciutto and used a fig infused balsamic for the drizzle.

9785158,0,t1_daj86e4,It actually would depend on what part of the country you were in but the most popular regional style is Texas BBQ which is meat that is dry rubbed mainly in salt and pepper and then hot smoked for periods of  hours. Mainly brisket short ribs pulled pork hot links smoked chicken or turkey etc. It is also all about the sides that work well with those flavors and the different kinds of BBQ sauce that you can pair with the meat. For us it is a style of food not just an instrument and what you guys call a BBQ we would likely call a GRILL.,food,daj8fjg,2,t5_2qh55

A better quality oil is great in that it adds flavor in and of itself  to salads cooking anything. Lower quality oil tastes like nothing and is often adulterated with other oils has a greasier feel and fewer health benefits. As fresh as you can get it the better. A really good quality olive oil might make you cough when you taste it straightup. Expect to pay at least . Like wine really good quality is worth it. Imported olive oils are really nice but you might get fresher oil and more information about the batch if you can get something from a farm in California. ,food,daluv5m,1,t5_2qh55

You want to worry about smoke like the poster said until you hit an internal temp on your meat f. After that the meat accepts no more smoke and you just have layer upon layer build up on the outside of the meat. After a while all those layers give off an acrid taste. Hickory and Mesquite are very strong smoking woods. Use sparingly. Because they will continue to add smoke until they are ash. Best bet is to use if charcoal  chunks mesquitehickory and  chunks fruit tree pecan apple cherry. This way you will can fill your meat with smoke without over smoking the outside of your meat. ,food,dbgztrb,7,t5_2qh55

Correct cooking method and temperature. Follow recipes word for word and then once you perfect these start to make harder recipes. Try to resist adding your spin until you know what you are doing. A good scrambled egg is harder than you think. Eggs and butter in a nonstick pan. Take off the heat while still a bit runny. Your hot pan will cook still. Do not add salt or pepper until almost done.

It helps to know the other rules if you feel like showing up and being a jerk to users in the comments. This is usually reflected in the community downvoting you. Homemade  in this sub means you prepared the food at home. It does not indicate that you made it from scratch. We have tags to indicate if you went to a restaurantcafefood truck and they made it for you I ate or if you work in the food industry prochef. Charcuterie boards are homemade unless you ate it at a restaurant or you are a prochef. Does that help?,food,dbvnhfe,3,t5_2qh55

Run down shacks or ridiculously tacky restaurants stuck in  almost always have the best barbecue.You can easily apply this to lobster rolls. Stick to random seafood shacks along the coast throughout New England especially Maine. Honestly just by winging it you will probably find some damn good food.

I mashed the beans almost to a paste then very finely chopped the onion bell pepper and garlic in a food processor. In another bowl I beat two eggs and added the spice blend. I then combined the mashed beans processed veggies egg and spice blend and corn into a mixing bowl and mixed on low for about  minutes. As it mixed I added  ounces of bread crumbs a little at a time and continued mixing until the mixture became semi firm.

10665279,0,t3_5silm2,I just made a New York strip last night. Was one of the best steaks Ive had ever. Got home from the butcher and let it get to room temp with salt pepper and minced garlic. Dried it with paper towel a few times while it rested.Got a pan very hot I need a cast iron pan! Little bit of butter on the pan and dropped the steak on for a minute on each side to sear it then  seconds each side twice  minutes total on the high heat.Place on cutting board with tinfoil tent for  minutes to rest and finish cooking. Before last night I had never taken the time to get it to room temp before cooking or let it sit after so Id be cooking a cold steak and trying to fight to get the inside up to temp without over cooking. Letting it get to room temp first makes a world of difference. Dont cook cold steak!,food,ddg1jcp,2,t5_2qh55

He does his homework and basically always produces really good results. He also explains why he does things in many of his recipes and all of his shows frequently foraying lightly into the chemistry behind some of the processes.

Im really on the fence about this one with regards to mixing as I love cheese. Italian food that we know largely has regional rural roots. In simpler times you wouldnt have mixed two expensive ingredients together such as seafood and cheese. You would enjoy each on their own. Seafood can be subtle whereas cheese can overpower the palette. Italians love their traditions which is why this style has probably continued today. If you have watched Chefs Table SE with Massimo Bottura you can see how difficult it is to break away from traditional Italian cooking. Youll be proclaimed a heretic. I say break the mould. Add cheese with your seafood if you enjoy it. Just understand the history.,food,de26w2u,3,t5_2qh55

Braising a salmon would yield a disgusting dry smelly overcooked piece of fish.    There are some recipes online that use the word braising with salmon but none of them actually braise the fish. Searing a filet of salmon and letting it stew for a few minutes in some broth or fumet with some aromatics is not braising.   Like I said before nobody braises salmon.  ,food,deei8wf,0,t5_2qh55

Everything is prepared so putting it together takes no more than  minuteswhich is already very long time.The stock for ramen takes the most time. It is obviously prepared before for as long as it takes and then stored. You make a batch and when you start running low you make another one. Also Im sure that most places keep some frozen. It all depends on the quality of the restaurant and how ramen focused they are. There are places that start super early or cook it overnight and make it fresh everyday and there are places that make a big batch that is enough for a few daysweeks.,food,demq6eo,5,t5_2qh55

11212441,0,t3_6026dm,One of my favorite foods is Cracker Barrels country fried steak with veggies and mashed potatoes. So tonight my wife and I attempted to out do Cracker Barrel... it worked. The secret was instead of using evaporated milk spices and flour I replaced the evaporated milk with Campbell mushroom condensed soup. I put milk and mushroom soup in the bullet blender and it came out nice! So you need chopped beef steaks . for two  plate of flour with salt pepper amp garlic salt then dip the steaks into seasoned flour then into bowl of milk amp mushroom mix then back into flour then into a pan with roughly  inches of canola oil heated to medium heathigh. Cook two minutes on each side or until golden brown. I cooked them a little longer because I like them a little extra crispy. Gravy just milk and flour with salt amp pepper. I added a couple drops of Tobasco and a small piece of beef bouillon. Heat until milk amp flour start to bubble while mixing often. Sweet Corn was microwave bag. But some butter salt pepper and your good. Mashed potatoes unfortunately were boxed so wasnt impressed with how they tasted. Didnt have fresh potatoes to mash. But I topped them with gravy so they werent too bad. Result is... I official now make my favorite country fried steak!! Hope you Enjoy amp Bon Appetite!,food,df2x18u,4,t5_2qh55

I feel like when people think of edibles their minds instantly think of potent chocolates and cookies then become intimidated. I think this a great way to slowly introduce people to this community and that it is definitely not a bunch of fat lazy stoners with permanent Cheeto fingers.

Just searing the outside of a steak will bring the surface temperature well above what is needed to kill anything living on the surface of the steak. This of course only applies to whole pieces of meat.With ground meat you want to bring above  before letting it go for long periods of time because in the grinding process any surface contaminant will be mixed throughout. But at that point that would be considered hot holding not really cooking.Source Am professional chef with years of sanitation and safety training.,food,dgdna8l,4,t5_2qh55

Franklin was noticeably better than the few other bbq places I had while I was there. Although I didnt go to La BBQ which is supposed to be its closest rival. Because Franklin was so much better than the other stuff I had is why I say it was worth doing once.

I just got my first mtn bike about  months ago and thats partially why I wanted to head down there is so I can actually do what I enjoy on the weekends. What type of work do you do?

11764379,0,t3_67smwg,The story behind the Hot Chicken from Nashville is so amazing.gtThey say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned  but some folks like a little heat including Thorton Prince  the father of Nashvilles hot chicken.gtEven in the height of the Great Depression Thorton Prince knew how to have a good time. He enjoyed the nightlife and had a wellearned reputation as being quite the ladies man. Of course one person who was not too thrilled with that reputation was his steady girl.gtWhile we dont know if Prince came home one night with a faint hint of perfume or a smudge of lipstick on his collar we do know that after another one of Princes nights out his scorned lover wanted revenge. And using Princes love of fried chicken as bait she concocted the perfect recipe.gtInstead of a lecture the next morning Prince awoke to the sizzlin smell of fried chicken. The trap set Princes jilted lover served up a plate of homemade fried chicken. Without noticing the devilish amount of peppers and spices she had sprinkled on the chicken Prince dug in. Much to her dismay Prince didnt fall over weeping in pain. Nope he asked for seconds and at that moment the legend was born.gtPrince perfected the recipe for Hot Chicken and opened up a restaurant  Princes Hot Chicken Shack. Almost  years later a lot has changed in Nashville. But not Princes. Thorton Princes great niece Ms. Andre Prince Jeffries is still serving the legendary dish that Nashvillians crave. In the last few years the hot chicken trend has caught on like wildfire throughout the South but Princes Hot Chicken is the original and remains the gold standard for hot chicken.,food,dgtisvq,6,t5_2qh55

11792019,0,t1_dgwiodv,From my experience of watching the travel channel gelato is ice cream but thickermore dense so more flavor. While ice cream is more airy. The vagueness between the two probably allows people to brand their ice cream as gelato to sound exotic Ive tried gelato from the ice cream aisle and it was just ice cream lol.
