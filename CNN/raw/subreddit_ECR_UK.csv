I dont mean to suggest to vape it by itself but mixing it with any of their other flavours boosts the freshness. Its not the usual chemical feeling menthol that just sort of cold burns your throat it actually feels like iciness of a slushy.  I especially recommend a mix of fresh squeeze and frost a combination that they are going to launch readymade soon I guess but i think the idea of element vapes is that you can mix and match their flavours to create your own blends as they all go very well with each other.,ECR_UK,d2wupa0,1,t5_39vq4

8729733,0,t1_d6wjmu3,Its not time consuming if once youve found a recipe you like you create a concentrate mix and if you are working in larger volumes eg ml bottles. Recipes can range from having  base flavour to probably  just because a recipe isnt complex doesnt mean it isnt delicious.Initial upfront cost can range drastically. I started with a starter kit for about  but if I did it again I wouldnt buy one. L of VG and PG can be bought for about  each I buy mine from Amazon flavourings are about . roughly per ml but some places are cheaper Darkstar vapour sells ml bottles for around .. In a starter kit mixing by volume Id get a few flavours you think youd like or are recommended some VG and PG amount is up to you some nicotine solution or a PGVG base with nicotine in it. You should wear a pair of nitrile gloves when handling nicotine solution most times I dont since my nicotine is in bottles with dripping tips. Nicotine should be stored in a cool dark place to avoid oxidation.Next is syringes Id suggest a few ml a few ml and maybe a ml one but not in a starter. Thats about it apart from some some bottles.Flavours is the most expensive part but its better once you find a recipe you like My favourite is a raspberry dragonfruit cream that has four but could easily be developed to include many more for a better flavour. Stick to recommended flavours that many people like an use before buying more obscure or different flavours. Like I said darkstar vapour is cheap for the amount you get but their smallest size is ml.I have a top section of my wardrobe dedicated to DIY stuff. Also allows me to store my liquid for steeping. My extra nicotine should be in the freezer but I dont have any room for a separate section for it and havent bought any ziploc bags so is in a cool storage area at the minute.,ECR_UK,d6wv029,1,t5_39vq4

9794814,0,t1_dakf02y,Juice reviews for me and hardware reviews as well to some extent have always been subjective for me. That doesnt make it any less valuable. Personal opinion is important. Every rating database like juicedb elr even IMDb and stuff are an aggregation of personal opinions. The best way to present juice reviews imo is tell us about what kind of flavour profiles you generally enjoy talk about the juices you are reviewing and compare them to other juices with similar flavour profiles that you have liked or disliked. This may give the reader a sort of reference to make a decision. For e.g. if you dont like custard but say that this juice is the one custard you do like this may inspire a reader who doesnt like custard either to give it a shot.TLDR. Personal opinion is great dont worry about expressing it.,ECR_UK,dakf84x,1,t5_39vq4

10506679,0,t3_5qghd1,Not bogus vape can set some off and most places dont keep up to date on if their alarms are vape or CO sensitive. Usually they are fine in hotels because the small area means bathroom steam can also set them off but better to not risk it really.,ECR_UK,dcz1kns,2,t5_39vq4
10559682,0,t1_dd0z267,Hey man thanks for the message. Im not overly interested in anything by Smok anymore. Burned by their tanks now so Ill stick to their mods only. Ive just picked up a Cleito  so not really after another of those either. Thanks for taking the time to reply.,ECR_UK,dd5256q,1,t5_39vq4
10681656,0,t3_5stl22,My Cleito  started out like that but once I made sure the coils were tight closed the vents while refilling and made sure to never fill it above the little lip near the top of the coil it stopped leaking and not lost a drop since. Worth checking to make sure a tight seal is made at the base of the coil too.,ECR_UK,ddhqd0f,1,t5_39vq4
10695636,0,t1_ddj5dfh,There are more than enough flavours out there you can enjoy.I am able to taste some strawberry in Inawera Shisha Strawberry but I also get this strong almost pungent shisha note. I dont know if this flavour is supposed to taste that way because people are using it for all sorts of recipes an in a mix its definitely the first thing I get.Sucralose can help too.,ECR_UK,ddj6bk7,1,t5_39vq4

10770823,0,t1_ddqwbu4,Haha yeah probably not so bad that way. I dripped it on my Recoil and it was just super harsh like almost unbearable and just tasted awful lol.,ECR_UK,ddqxiq5,1,t5_39vq4
10857192,0,t3_5v79y4,Only ever used mechs so efficiency was my priority when finding a preferred coil build and I settled on Ni.Flatwire for max surface area and polished up all shiny makes cleaning between rewicks a breeze.,ECR_UK,ddzucll,1,t5_39vq4

10947606,0,t1_de8seul,The Aspire K is an amazing vape. No leaking flooding spitting gurgling just an all round excellent piece of kit. It uses the Nautilus BVC coils which are readily available and one of the best coils on the market.,ECR_UK,de9628x,1,t5_39vq4

11244276,0,t1_df6iig3,Is it still a relevant device? Ive heard mixed things about it. People speak fondly of it but Ive been hearing more and more bad things about it recently. Plus its and old device,ECR_UK,df6isx6,1,t5_39vq4
11254984,0,t3_60ccbs,Its between my Kennedy  and my SOI tubes liked the first so much I got a second!.The Kennedy is great good balance of flavour with the right builds and clouds airflow isnt too loose a lot of newer atties Ive tried are way too open the cap design means condensation can be wiped before it makes it to the base excellent build quality and it looks awesome. My only complaint is that I wish the pin protruded a bit more for peace of mind on hybrids and I wish I had a gremlin cap for the .The SOI tubes are perfect. That clutch switch and the constant battery contact mean arcing isnt a problem the huge contacts in the  cap and on the subzero rda in hybrid mode work great and the switch can be swapped between the shorty I use it for travel and the legendary use it around the house or for comp hits. Again for balance there is a problem the  cap can be a bastard to adjust to sit flush and avoid battery rattle but I suppose its the same on all tubes where the atty goes on last. ,ECR_UK,df7qhha,2,t5_39vq4
11273115,0,t3_6043kk,Well the stuff turned up and I made my own ml juice!!! Its smells great but Im going let it sit before I try it.,ECR_UK,df9shpd,1,t5_39vq4

11288157,0,t1_dfbf82x,Cheers mate thanks for replying.Quick followups if you dont mind. What coils come with the tank as standard and is it fairly compatible with other coil types? And is . a decent price for the kit? Thanks again ,ECR_UK,dfbhvnu,2,t5_39vq4
11350503,0,t3_61z4rb,Awesome. That coil looks beasty. Hope some premades like this get put on the website or something because making coils is so dull for me.,ECR_UK,dfik4e0,3,t5_39vq4

11458958,0,t1_dft3ww8,Legend! Thanks for the tip! Now Im torn because Ive been on mg juices for about  weeks... Do I want to reintroduce nicotine into my life just for the sake of key lime cookie? It was my favourite flavour. Vapourdepots lime cookie didnt quite stack up to it. Talking to myself out loud insert weirdface,ECR_UK,dfuv5or,1,t5_39vq4

11761815,0,t3_65iatl,I only have tried  tanks.  The nautilus  a kabuki clone and a fantasy clone.  They are all pretty similar.  I cant compare the tank flavors because I have only used different coils in each . in the fantasy . in the kabuki and . in the nautilus .  .ohm has the least flavor . the most.  The vika fantasy has the best design of the three.  The center post is too short in the kabuki clone limiting bottom fill.  The coil of the nautilus  will get stuck in the top regularly without some modification and dump liquid.  The fantasy is shortest without drip tip and can more effectively use the cleito ml glass and hold the most.  Nautilus  can be less whistley with the multiple air holes.,ECR_UK,dgt8c1o,1,t5_39vq4
11779415,0,t1_dgv0xlm,Yeah could well be that mate tbh. Blast menthol liquid for a while to clean your pallet that often helps me ,ECR_UK,dgv8fxi,1,t5_39vq4
