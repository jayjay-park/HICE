4744358,0,t3_36dkzy,Had a friend on Facebook say how horrible these have to exist. I dont understand how parents could even forget about their kids no word for word  years ago then last month she freaks out because she left her   year old child in her car saying she was halfway in the store before she remembered. Said since shes damn near carrying the kid  her subconscious must have just assumed she had her with her.,mildlywtf,ctskklx,1,t5_2tfwt
