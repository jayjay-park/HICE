1851671,0,t3_2far4t,Its entirely possible that the anime will be picked up again. However as of now that may just be wishful thinking. In my opinion the recent O.V.A.s have been phenomenal. Unfortunately there would have to not only be a high demand but also a decent amount of revenue being generated from these features for a production company to even consider doing a full season. Given the  years its taken to release only  episodes it doesnt seem to be the case. ,Kenichi,ckcbl7y,1,t5_2vid3
1896947,0,t3_2gcepc,My main problem with the ending is the lack of Muis dad he was kind of forgotten. ,Kenichi,ckhrtj6,6,t5_2vid3
1902569,0,t3_2gefmo,Im not sure about some of the other points but Kenichi definitely surpassed Miu at the end.,Kenichi,ckig5bj,0,t5_2vid3
2259042,0,t3_2l1gcb,Kenichi vs sho is the best close are the figth vs koukin and ofcourse the figth against satomi but i still read all of DofD arc from once in a while its so fucking epic.,Kenichi,clqxsy2,2,t5_2vid3
11296364,0,t3_5s62es,Yep the D of D sure it is. Its roughly Battle  or a slightly later chapter when Kenichi was pitted against Kaku Shintenor Guo Chengtian which is the proper Chinese spelling,Kenichi,dfcfcpu,1,t5_2vid3
