2976851,0,t3_2u8b7q,Youll want to post on the XMage Forums for this. I highly doubt anyone that is likely to add cards will see it here. Make a post in the card requests thread and someone should see it. No guarantees though about how long it might take someone to put it in.,XMage,co6hfl0,2,t5_32vl0

6353295,0,t1_cza8mu0,The source you are using for these is tokens.mtg.onl. Most of them arent tokens but for the ones are you can download them manually from the tokens.mtg.onl website which I mention in the post I linked you to. On that page choose the Duel Decks Anthology set and save the images it brings up.  There are several promo cards in the images you are missing. Most promo images can be found here in the first post. For FNM promos save them in the imagesFNMP folder as cardname.full.jpg.  The  newest Expeditions are on mythicspoiler.com all the way at the bottom of the newest cards page. Save those images as cardname.full.jpg in the imagesEXP folder.  For the SDCC planeswalkers probably the best images I could find are starcitygames.com or tcgplayer.com. You can maybe just do a google image search too. You have to save both the front and back of each card in imagesMBP as cardname.full.jpg. Hope that helps!,XMage,czbss5d,1,t5_32vl0

7084947,0,t3_4ck77h,I would like to be able to display the GY and Exile Zone vertically like in MTGO or at least be able to expand the display over to my second screen to take advantage of screen realestate and move those stupid windows over.Also why does the Exile window stay open with no option to close it I know you can minimize it? Why is there a second exile zone on the player card interface that can be expanded and closed like the GY? Why cant we use that one instead of the one that forces itself to be open and in your face all the time? Too many minimized windows clutter up the play space.Please let me know of any ways to modify the interface.,XMage,d1jg1ja,1,t5_32vl0

11380330,0,t3_62bva3,I was able to figure it all out last night. Problem statement follows with TLDR at the end.serverAddress needs set to the domain name youre connecting to from the outside. So if youre connecting to foo.domain.com on port  you need to set it to foo.domain.com.Now since most servers live behind NAT configurations you obviously need to forward those ports as described. You also have to set the servers host file entry for foo.domain.com to your severs internal IP. Not the public IP. In my ec case its a .x subnet.This way the jboss server can do the dns lookup for the host name. When it gets the IP from the host file as the internal nic it binds to the correct interface. It will also make sure the jboss server responds to requests from the right host name foo.domain.comWhen you have a client connect to the server over the internet it should get the external IP from your DNS provider like normal. But since the request is using the FQDN the jboss server accepts the connection and responds correctly. TLDRThe serverName is irrelevant. That can be literally anything you want. My Frickin Laser Shark ServerserverAddress MUST be the fully qualified DNS entry that people will use to connect.If in a NAT situation behind a routerfirewall you must open both binding ports. Those can also be almost anything you want but default  is fine. The secondary port is only in case the first one is in use by something else. You MUST also configure the hosts file etchosts on nix systems to have the fully qualified DNS pointing to the INTERNAL network interface typically a .x .x .x.Then everything will work.,XMage,dflxw8h,2,t5_32vl0
