346789,0,t3_1xxr1n,I think Im the wrong man to have been asked that question.  Theres no doubt in my mind that Trout is one of the best players in the game.  Is he the best?  I think theres a lot of people that have other players that they call the best.  Robbie Cano comes into play in that respect.However its always been my belief that most athletes regardless of which sport they play are grossly overpaid.  But having said that I also realize that the market is much much different now.  Players that are marginal are making  milyr.  Ive often said each time a marginal player gets that kind of money for putting on a losing performance Sign me up.  I can play that bad and I need the moneyI cant remember the name of the pitcher this is many years ago that had a season like    with a high era and he got a contract like about  miyr.  I desperately wanted to be put in a uniform LOL.No...I wouldnt pay Trout that much money.  Theres too many Ifs involved with players such as what if he tears an achilles tendon what if his knees give out what if he loses his hitting stroke.  That puts any team in a Yankee situation like the contracts with the Roid CC and Tex.  Nope....its just not worth it.  Something like  would be my limit.,espnyankees,cfgposf,1,t5_2xscf

3332817,0,t3_2ycace,Yankees Have Come Closest On Cole HamelsBy Zach Links March   at am CDTMany teams have called on ace Cole Hamels but so far one club has enticed the Phillies more than the others.  Of the teams that have expressed interest in Hamels the Yankees have come closer than anyone Nick Cafardo of the Boston Globe writes.  The Bombers have offered a package of prospects for the yearold that at least has given the Phillies a baseline for future talks.Trading Hamels who pitched two strong innings in his spring training debut Friday against the Yankees would help the Phillies kickstart their rebuilding efforts in earnest.  However they continue to insist that another team should take on the entirety of Hamels salary as well as part with top level prospects.  Last month Cafardo wrote that the Phillies seemed willing to wait it out for the right deal perhaps even taking things up until the trade deadline.The Red Sox have been heavily connected to Hamels this winter but Bob Nightengale of USA Today reported recently that talks have actually been dormant for weeks.  Meanwhile Cafardo hears that Cliff Lee could actually wind up changing uniforms before Hamels does.,espnyankees,cp86154,1,t5_2xscf

4707219,0,t1_ctnn027,Heres the thing though.  Our RF platoon has been the most underrated part of this team.  We all realize how incredible Young has been in the platoon role.  Beltran had a brutal start to the season but he has been over . OPS every month from May on and has a plus WAR despite the awful start to the season.  The place where he is a liability is in the field.  I am not convinced that Judge would be able to come up and help enough immediately down the stretch.  He is our future there for sure but I am fine with him staying down with the way our OF has been performing.  Maybe he gets a call the next time Jacoby is hurt.  Ackleys role?  Ackley is going to be a utility guy playing all over.  Judge cant do that.  You want Judge to back up B?Severino is the only one that was a MUST to come up.  Even Refsnyder is putting it on himself with his brutal defense.   ,espnyankees,ctnvsfg,1,t5_2xscf

The younger cheaper more athletic mantra has been preached for several years now hopefully it sticks this time so were going to have to see what the hit rate ends up being on some of these kids.

8406944,0,t1_d5sdyuz,I feel like it would take both an awful lot of devotion and pure love of the sport as well as a particular focus for what you like about the sport to really follow the prospect side of the game. It is x harder to do both in baseball than it is with say football. The games are played at the same time as the MLB games and they arent nearly as accessible. A lot of the information out there is learned secondhand and speaking on personal preference only secondhand information is useless to me if I cant verify it or contrast it with firsthand information. I was in Mobile AL during the week of the Senior Bowl this year and you know what was really fucking cool to see? When many of the notes I scribbled during the practices things that stood out to me an untrained eye with a lot of this kind of stuff was the same kind of stuff that well known draftniks were writing in their dayend reports. Doesnt sound like much but it shows that anyone can actually do the stuff if they really actually want to do it. For me personally the challenge really often becomes committing to doing something one of my biggest life failings is that I really tend to lack focus and its always been a challenge to work on. Im not really sure Im winning that challenge and its discouraging that Im so very aware of it. That said its not an excuse either I just need to be better about it.Anyway to tie this back together when it comes to minor league stuff baseball and hockey specifically for me its the kind of stuff I would love to dig further into but the logistics of it are difficult. Many years back I considered going to Tampa Yankees games when Brackman and Betances were both starters there dont laugh thats rude but at my age at the time and that I live across the bridge in St. Pete it just wasnt a feasible consideration at the time and in the  years since ...I think that was  when they were in Tampa the idea the romance if you will of doing that just doesnt really exist anymore. I actually greatly respect youre diligence in watching the Sev starts in Scranton Im guessing through MiLB.tv which is an app you have to pay for and I pay enough for sports apps as it is thank you very much because speaking only for myself but others could probably agree I just dont have the time or patience really to dig into that stuff with the necessary gusto. Maybe in the future maybe in the past?! but not today.

You know general manager Brian Cashman and I have talked about it and its not something that I think would benefit me or the Yankees.  So no Im staying put.  Yes Tex. Youre right. It wouldnt benefit the Yankees to have one of the worst hitters in baseball removed from the lineup to clear playing time for Tyler Austin.Go fuck yourself you bucket headed waste of a load.,espnyankees,d6kbz0u,1,t5_2xscf

8870738,0,t3_51p6zh,Had the Yankees stood pat at the deadline  I think they would have fallen further behind.  The teams trajectory was definitely down and it was clear to me anyway that they were playing tight.Since the deadline deals  the expectations most definitely dropped and the team received an infusion of youth and energy and combined with zero pressure  the team has responded.  They are playing like a team with nothing to lose where had they not made the deals  they would still be carrying the burden of expectation which they were clearly not good at.  ,espnyankees,d7e4ywr,1,t5_2xscf

McCanns debt will be clear as well.With all of the youth waiting in the wings money is no obstacle. They should be shopping for the best players available not the cheapest buys.

9879503,0,t1_davbbpv,Yea Im not really hoping the Yankees give Chapman M as a kneejerk reaction  but I really am disappointed that they did not check this out more thoroughly.  For a team looking to keep costs down  I would figure that trading for one of the  best pitchers at such a reasonable rate would have been in their wheelhouse.  And like I said  what a trade chip to have down the line if you decide youre not in it or you dont think youll sign him.,espnyankees,davbmcu,1,t5_2xscf
9973274,0,t1_db7acsc,Yeah theyre fourth best vs the sack but I said only above average essentially middle of the pack because of the limitations of the stat. Its obviously not a good line but still better than half of the leagues which are downright awful. I also think most of the screw ups can be linked to one guy. If they integrate  Beatty at LT and either bench Flowers or move him to the right side theyll be better off.I agree with your overall point completely. Outside of Beckham the entire O is a mess. This upcoming draft theyre definitely getting another O lineman to atone for the Flowers whiff but theyd be foolish not to invest in a legit running back or tight end. I like Perkins and Adams respectively but cmon. Real solutions please. You cant build an O around one superstar. ,espnyankees,db7jmfl,1,t5_2xscf
