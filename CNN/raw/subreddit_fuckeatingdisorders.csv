3737498,0,t3_337aj9,Hi welcome to the subreddit and thank you for sharing your story Eating disorders do tend to run in families and theres a huge genetic link there so given your sister its more likely that you would develop one. And I definitely think you have an eating disorder to some degree although Im not really qualified to say. A lot of people with eating disorders are high achievers who strive for perfection and tend to be pretty obsessive so its pretty common for us to be very successful in other areas of our lives apart from our relationship with food.The food obsession definitely seems like its there and has been for a while. Theres nothing wrong with enjoying food but like you said often theres an obsession with eating only good foods and limiting others. Obviously some foods are better than others but rather then looking at food in terms of good or bad it sometimes helps to look at it as fuel and how it will help your body. Its also important to remember that food is fuel but that doesnt mean that you cant enjoy it  I think moderation is one of the hardest things that someone with an eating disorder has to learn unfortunately.And what youve been through is awful and its no wonder that something like this could have been set off by an event like that. I hope youre doing a bit better in terms of that but I know that rape is horrific to go through and it takes a huge amount of time for people to recover from.I do agree that you do need to seek some help though. Are there any therapists or counsellors that you could speak to? You sound like you have a restrictive eating disorder but luckily you have come out of the denial phase and can see the problem for what it is. You sound like I did when I first noticed that I had an eating disorder and I strongly urge you to get help as soon as possible. I know that change is terrifying because you fear the loss of control and gaining weight but youre not the one in control right now. The eating disorder gives us a false sense of control and makes us believe that we can control it but it will get stronger and stronger unless you fight it. Its lucky that youve realised this now because the longer that it continues the stronger it gets and its that much harder to deal with.Unfortunately your work situation probably doesnt help the food obsession but if you think you can handle it then you can. I dont know what your current eating habits are but one of the most important things is establishing a regular pattern of eating again. My therapist recommended eating every  hours and  meals and  snacks per day. Ideally a dietician should do it in conjunction with your needs but even eating just a mouthful every three hours is better than nothing. The regular eating pattern is essential as it stops the cycle of restriction. Secondly I found that making food logs was helpful for me when I was first in recovery. I dont keep them now but at the beginning it was incredibly useful for me to see just how bad it was and how chaotic my eating patterns were. There are some online ones that you can print out where you can write down your feelings or behaviours at the time of the meal along with whether you used laxatives binged andor purged. You dont have to keep them forever as I know they can be very tedious but theyre useful at the start. Another thing that might help is starting a recovery journal where you can record your feelings and thoughts plus any realisations that youve had.Also if you get stressed about meals distraction can be a great tool. Since you are a yogi maybe doing some light yoga after a meal or snack could calm you down if you feel anxious or guilty. I draw and listen to music and it gets me to stop focusing on food and portion sizes by diverting my attention. What do you do for yourself? Oftentimes an eating disorder can be a way to punish ourselves and we lose sight of who we actually are because we become the eating disorder instead. It sounds cheesy but the one thing that Im constantly told by my current therapist and everyone else in recovery is that the most important relationship youll ever have is with yourself. Once you begin to love yourself again the eating disorder starts to lose its hold on you because it stops filling whatever void you used it to feel. Also its common to get very emotional during recovery because all the issues that caused your eating disorder are the ones that you have to face to be able to recover.,fuckeatingdisorders,cqiarxx,1,t5_34jzi

Granted I dont eat it but still oilpulling with refined coconut oil is just not refreshing. Or particularly pleasant.Organic virgin coconut oil has numerous health benefits so youre not missing our by opting for the oil over nut butters. I have a history of bingeing overtly fatty things like eating almost an entire container of tahini in a sitting so I only recently added full fat peanut butter back so far so goodno bingeing. gtI feel bad about not being vegan from a ecological standpoint and ive been vegetarianveganfully raw for periods of time but since i got talented at purgeing  eyeroll  i cant do the volume of food i did then anymore and im hypoglycemic off and on It seems like i do better with more fat and some animal protein sources daily.Listen dont feel bad. You dont have to feel guilty or justify your choices to anyone. Even if I were fully vegan right now I wouldnt judge you because thats a cunterific thing to do. Different people require different intakes and amounts of nutrients. Some people do good on this and some people do good on that. Do what works for you and dont apologize for it. Why should you? Do you have a dietician? They can help you come up with a meal plan that works around your gastro issues and yes you should make an appointment with the gastro soon if you can.

4089129,0,t3_375chf,I was a smart kid I was also a snotty know it all. Partly because I Was raised by a parent who was extremely proud of me being smart and encouraged me to be clever at every opportunity and to some extent to show off. So I was a total asshole really. Obviously I got bullied some was unrelated bullying I was just a weird kid who daydreamed too much and was just... odd. Weird kids get bullied weird know it alls get bullied more. Started comfort eating cant remember if my mum or grandaprents were food makes it better people or not. Mum spoiled me anyway because I was the first child and shed had six or so miscarriages before me and had to have daily injections while she was pregnant to keep me. Grandparnets are old and lived through WW so they were very much finish everything on your plate people and after my grandma quit smoking she kind of got addicted to sweets and cake. Anyway comfort eating from bullying leads to a fat shit of a kid and more bullying and more binging.On and off through high school  I skipped meals and fasted because I hated myself I hated people seeing me eat and I was struggling with depression I remember even before high school thinking that maybe it would be better if I died but then Id miss horse riding so I stuck around and after  self harm. Just before my th birthday something snapped drastically cut calories fasted more started purging.Lost a lot of weight people like me more. Since then its been better and worse as Ive gotten older Ive gotten more useless at restricting and stress makes me comfort eatbinge more. So I purge more. After teaching myself to purge hands free bp has just been easier than restricting and I dont have fear foods any more.But I restrict and purge because I want to lose weight. Because Im too fat. Because I am lonely and it turns out people like you more when youre thin. And if I lose enough weight maybe Ill actually have friends and I wont be the weird kid any more and maybe Ill actuaally do well at my PhD because we all know being thinner makes you smartr and more capable right?I think Im just mental.,fuckeatingdisorders,crmdvyo,1,t5_34jzi

Also just because you feel physically healthy doesnt mean that you are. Your body has adapted to the damages so you dont notice. Furthermore there could be something medically destructive to you that you cant feel yet. Like a heart issue for example. Please please talk to your doctor because even if there is nothing medically physically wrong with you the fact that you are in mental anguish is enough.

Out of the team of experts that I have seen throughout recovery doctor therapist and nutritionist the nutritionist was the most helpful in the beginning stages of regaining some normalcy with eating.  They can help to give you the tools to understand how to approach food again. Binging and yoyoing between eating and not eating can be very dangerous especially in the beginning.

This is partly due to the notsocrashhot feeling of food in our stomach but also due to our hunger cues being completely screwed up there are studies that show this I cant be bothered to find them but they do exist. Also I highly recommend trying a different dietician one that specialises in eating disorders.

She would comment on my body changing in a negative way tell me to unstrap the feed bag. I was never overweight. Just going through puberty. I was a US size  moving up to a  at  and her taunts increased as my bra size did. I turned to diet pills I would buy from friends who would steal them. Restricting calories purging. Ongoing struggle since. The hurtful words didnt stop then. She was still calling me fat at  laughing at me while she called me names. Despite me literally begging her to stop multiple times. Her verbal and emotional abuse was part of what led to a protective order against her and me completely cutting her out of my life. I highly recommend the book Toxic Parents to anyone struggling with parental relationships. Helped me a lot. ,fuckeatingdisorders,d3yd8bl,1,t5_34jzi
8417093,0,t1_d5tnsug,I kind of want to seek out help but I dont want to worry my parents. They already deal with enough stuff with my brother having depression and anxiety and having to pay back loans for helping to treat my brother. I feel like adding more to their plate when its a problem that I feel like I can control would just do more harm than good,fuckeatingdisorders,d5tohfh,2,t5_34jzi
8435094,0,t1_d5vv03x,You are not overreacting. This is serious and Im glad you see that and want to talk to people to seek advice or help. Thats the first step.Dont let it become something major before you get help. There will never be a perfect time for it... Theres always something going on... And the longer you wait the more it will cost them.You worry about being a burden. Im wondering a bit off topic here but its a little related. From what youve said and what your parents sound like it seems to me that the lesson you learned as a kid was that you were wrong for having needs that the only way to get your parents to love you was to be perfect and never a moments trouble. It was the same for me. Its something Im going to need to work to overcome and it is a thought pattern I would hate to see you stuck in for as long as Ive been stuck. Its wonderful and considerate of you to think of your parents and their needs too but ultimately they are supposed to be the adults and part of being a good parent is looking after the needs of their children. So please dont be ashamed or afraid to express your legitimate needs to your family. I cant promise how they will respond but know that you are not bad or wrong or weak for it. On the contrary it is courageous of you to speak up to ask for help and to tackle this problem early.,fuckeatingdisorders,d5vxcj2,2,t5_34jzi
8627092,0,t3_4w9wia,The one word I used constantly when I was ending the eating disorder was practice. I am practicing. Most days everything went great. Other days not so great. On those days I told myself that Im practicing. It takes a lot of time and repetition before something fully changes right? If going to therapy helps you practice then do it. If doing things independently allows you to practice then do that too. You get to decide what positive influences come into your life to better yourself and your future. Keep up the excellent work!!xoTracey,fuckeatingdisorders,d6jznmq,2,t5_34jzi

9902920,0,t3_5h4qm5,I get bingey in the evening too. Ive heard it can be due to a messed up circadian rhythm. I used MyFitnessPal to try to keep myself aware of my calories but I just would go mindless on the binging then seeing or thinking about the calories would trigger purging so it wasnt helpful. Ive found that Recovery Record has been really useful. It keeps me mindful of my emotional relationship with food and my body so my evening binges are much smaller and I havent purged in a long time. The only problem is that it always asks me about purging which puts the idea in my head. I havent acted on it yet but its like are you thinking about purging? and Im like well I am now jerk.   ,fuckeatingdisorders,daydggd,1,t5_34jzi

10143482,0,t3_5jvkkj,Well youve hinted in previous comments that people with EDs arent ready to be in relationships. I therefore dont see a problem here.,fuckeatingdisorders,dbtp7bp,3,t5_34jzi
11049005,0,t3_5xe4oc,Mind I can actually think clearly Im no longer so intently focused on food that my mind cannot focus on other tasks I am able to rationalise my thoughts better. The further into anorexia you go and the more malnourished you are the less you can engage in therapy or anything requiring more cognition than a slug. Body felt stronger didnt feel dizzy when standing up could actually engage with the world around me physically. Going for a walk was no longer an act of mental will. I could sit on a chair without discomfort I could shower standing upSocial life I can actually go out for social meals with friends now. generally I can only do small snacks at the moment unless I have checked the menu in advance etc. However this is a start. I isolated myself completely when I was unwell and that just sent me further down hill. My friends could hug me without feeling as though they would break me.,fuckeatingdisorders,dekdwa9,1,t5_34jzi
