852065,0,t3_23vtwu,Taken from this post LivingstonLanghorn  points  hours agoI agree with what you said but Im confused why Tom Wheeler seems to be saying that the proposal will not allow discrimination and that were all confused. Whats your take on his latest blog post?Wheeler said this on his FCC blog today    The allegation that it will result in anticompetitive price increases for consumers is also unfounded. That is exactly what the commercially unreasonable test will protect against harm to competition and consumers stemming from abusive market activity.    To be clear this is what the Notice will propose    That all ISPs must transparently disclose to their subscribers and users all relevant information as to the policies that govern their network That no legal content may be blocked and That ISPs may not act in a commercially unreasonable manner to harm the Internet including favoring the traffic from an affiliated entity.  In response to Tom Wheelers careful orchestrated statementnsqe  points  hours agoxHeres why thats nonsense.The new FCC proposal retains the transparency tenet from the original Open Internet principles which is fine  thats what the recent court decision allowed them to retain. So the short version to quote Wheelers summary is that the FCC proposes    That all ISPs must transparently disclose to their subscribers and users all relevant information as to the policies that govern their network    That no legal content may be blocked and    That ISPs may not act in a commercially unreasonable manner to harm the Internet including favoring the traffic from an affiliated entity.And that sounds awesome and perfectly logical and reasonable...if you live in a world in which you have a choice in ISPs. But you dont and if the Comcast merger goes through youre going to live in even less of one  weve gone from a world with around  thousands of little ISPs competing with one another to a world with a little handful of massive access providers who have carved up the country into territories with nearly no competition unless you live in a big city in which case you might be lucky enough to have two or three options.So you get to know just how badly your provider is screwing you. And you get to decide...uh...whether or not to give your provider money in order to be on the internet.Hooray....And thats not even going into a discussion about what the hell commercially unreasonable means or who gets to decide whats commercially unreasonable or even really looking at whether or not commercially unreasonable means that its perfectly fine to doublecharge companies like Netflix  once for access and once for bandwidth which means theyll have to pass the expense on to you the consumer...twice once for access and once for bandwidth while your own access provider is also doublecharging you as well once for access and once for bandwidth......And now you know just a small part of why this is really really troublesome.,Sacramento,ch14uum,-9,t5_2qi09

Its usually just a one man job and the machine does  of the work. other than needing a CDL which isnt hard to get actually and the company probably pays for it and the training about  months worth plus OTJ. isnt terribly difficult. Yeah not everyone is qualified to do it but its not like its hard or anything. I agree that paying a burger flipper  an hour is stupid. I was a general manager of a fast food restaurant making K a year working  work weeks to keep labor costs down. that worked out to something like hr and it took me a lot of blood sweat and tears to climb my way from lowly dishwasher to general manager of my own store. Ill be damned if someone flipping burgers which they dont even do anymore. mcdonalds has big machines that cook the burgers evenly on both sides. all you have to do is push a button. is going to make as much as someone who clawed their way up to running their own store. If you want to make fast food your career path thats great. work at it. blood sweat and tears. put in the extra effort and get promoted.

1035721,0,t3_25yr2j,I lived in the area for a few years  During the day its pretty safe  since there are a lot of cars driving updown th Street.   There are quite a few transients in the area  especially near the freeway ramps and AMPM At night it can get a bit sketchy.  Quite a few purse snatches robbery of cell phoneswallets.  Avoiding that often just requires a bit of street smarts  dont walk around with a  phone in your face at AM!  Walking to J St from W along th it gets a bit safer north of Q Street light rail station is between R amp Q StI strongly suggest walking around in the area during the day  and drive around the area at night. Some areas downtown are very dark with little or no lighting.  Scope out some potential walking routes at night. Downtown is filled with pockets of good and bad some right next to each other. One block is gorgeous  the next block is sketchy.  It boils down to your comfort and tolerance level. I would be worried about your immediate surroundings  A friend moved out of one area due to transients only to live in a seemingly cool Victorian building with drug dealers.If the price is a deciding factor  there are some cheap places closer to cool areas  you just have to be quick on the draw and sacrifice some amenities.  studio vs.  bedroom no laundry on site  no off street parking  There are some really cool but small places very close to Capital Park JK Street. ,Sacramento,chm0lkv,5,t5_2qi09

Natomas has  residents an established property tax and sales tax base just got approved for new levee funding which will lift the building moratorium and will be able to reappropriate the Arco site. Natomas will be just fine.Downtown is the real concern. There are more than  times as many people living in Natomas as there are Downtown. The Downtown Plaza has been dead for decades. Commercial real estate has stagnated since the economy turned sour. Downtown has been in trouble.Taking a moderate amount of money out of Natomas and moving it  miles south to a place thats infinitely more important is well worth it. The Kings will also generate way more revenue downtown than they ever could in Natomas.Lastly you mentioned that property taxes get paid regardless of whether buildings have tenants. Are you kidding me here? Yeah they get paid but theyre a lot fucking higher if the buildings are at capacity and there is desire to move in around them than they are if they and all of their neighbors are empty and vacant. The arena got approved  hours ago yet property values have been skyrocketing downtown for over a year just because there was TALK of an arena potentially happening. Now that its official? Watch what happens. Also that land downtown is worth way more than the Arco property in Natomas or any other property in Natomas for that matter.,Sacramento,chnmnt7,4,t5_2qi09

The northern end has convenient access to the  bus which runs on J and L Street straight to the northern entrance to CSUS. The Gold Line light rail line runs on R Street the th Street light rail station is a bit south of the campus and there are connecting buses that go to the aforementioned northern transit center.The other alternative east of Alhambra Boulevard are the Thrifty Thirties on the west end of East Sacramentocute and close to lots of amenities and safe roughly between McKinley Park and Stockton Boulevard on the streets from nd to th.

2113756,0,t3_2j4ovk,First of all Welcome future resident!         How big are your dogs? are we talking about two yipping yorkies or two massive great danes? Either way sacramento is very dog friendly that ive seen. There are parks galore especially in east sacrancho cordovadowntownmidtown. Really Id argue everywhere but south sacramento. I know there are parks down there and some of them quite nice theres one in Oak Park I want to say. big walking path around the whole perimeter mostly residential so its pretty quiet you can just walk and think...if its not in Oak Park its fairly close. but it just seems like youre never more than a  minute walk to a park really. I will admit that is one of the nicer things about Sacramento that I do like.           I hope you like hot weather.  Fall hasnt started yet so temps here are still in the  mark. It doesnt start getting cold and wet until near the end of October  beginning of November... the nice thing is it only gets down to around  in fall sometimes as high as  so you can still wear a light jacket or just a long sleeve shirt and be okay. I think the coldest ive seen here in the last  years was like . Which is pretty damned cold.           As far as things I do like? Ill be honest theres not much. But im exploring little by little. Old Sacramento is a staple destination for an afternoon. Take the lightrail walk bike theres even a parking garage kind of pricy though.... tons of ways to get there from most anywhere in the city. The new Kings arena will be right there too so expect to see over time a lot more businesses in the area though id argue probably more highend stuff rather than quaint little shops.           The railroad museum is actually pretty nice and its located right next to Old Sac so its kind of a Im already here why not? kind of thing. Theres a couple of decent restaurants and quite a few shops depending on how old you are g. whillikers is nerdvana. lol. stage  is nice for movierelated gear. Theres also a Joes Crab Shack a rivertboat a great little candy store they even give out free candy. etc.           Theres tons of stuff in surrounding areas as well Rancho Cordova Roseville Folsom is really nice for thrift stores and quaint little shops. People can be a little snobbish but its nice. that can depending on what youre into keep you occupied for quite a while. Youve got the Arden Mall here in Sac the Galleria in Roseville and Sunrise Mall area is decentish. Theres also a couple of outlet stores if you dont mind shopping there. Theres a really nice little outdoor mall of outlet stores off Folsom Blvd a main street in folsom as well.           As far as need to know I dont know where in Iowa you lived but neighborhoods here can vary wildly in just a few blocks. So its important when youre looking at a place to keep that in mind. Obviously theres no escaping crime but some places are just rougher than others. South Sac can be pretty bad Rosemont is alright Ranchos a mix if you ask me and downtown always seems active but I dont go roaming around the neighborhoods so I only really have experience in the inner city area.           That about sums up my opinion of Sacramento. Oh and the Jelly Belly factory is about half an hour away. Free tour jelly beans you can buy stuff at the shop etc. Its cute.

2824157,0,t3_2seq99,Question for anyone who rides RT regularly I only ride a few times a month during commute hours and dont have many complaints Have you ever seen the security guards not the RT officers but those private guards do like anything? I know theyre a bit hamstrung not being sworn officers and all but couldnt they at least tell people to STFU and to enforce basic rules like not using a loudspeaker on your phone  or bluetooth speaker to listen to music? This seems like lowhanging fruit. I understand that job sucks and if it were me Id stay the eff away from anyone looking remotely threatening if I could too but thats the job they signed up for.I know the broken windows theory is controversial in law enforcement in general but it seems absolutely necessary in this situation. Eg Okay I understand RT is on a tight budget and they try to do well with what they have. As such RT says they dont do as much ticket enforcement as people expect them to because they dont find that many farejumpers and it doesnt save much money. Ok but sometimes you have to enforce rules for other reasons. When you do fare enforcement you teach people that the rules apply to them. Same thing happens when you tell them to turn the effing music off.,Sacramento,cnp3mv7,7,t5_2qi09

5057391,0,t3_3k75ky,Ive had some slowness in the evenings lately to specific sites on CCI.If it continues the way to trouble shoot it is to download a utility for doing diagnostics and run some tests.  For example WinMTR which is free but there are many others.What you do is find out the IP of one Twitchs servers or use a text address whatever works and see where your connection has problems along the way.  A CCI tech may walk you through how to do this if you call but you can save some time by doing it yourself.Heres an article explaining how to use WinMTR.  Anyway the main thing is to see where the slowness or packet loss is happening.  If its between your PC and your router you need to troubleshoot your own gear.  If its happening farther down the line you need to call CCI.  This stuff should fix itself over time but calling does alert them to a problem.,Sacramento,cuvlugk,2,t5_2qi09

You cant just walk down the sidewalk and say Hi to random people they will think you are trying to scam them or something. You will get used to that pretty quickly though. Despite this they are generally better and more courteous drivers than those in the south. Atlanta may be different but moving from Raleigh I was surprised to see how dirty it is here. Like trash all over the side of the highway and the graffiti sucks. But again you get used to it. Other than that Mexican food is actually good tea is unsweetened by default and unfortunately you cant get mac and cheese as a side at every restaurant. Beer is way better. People will complain about the summer heat but having no humidity you will laugh at them. Also in the summer it will be  out but every body of water will feel like its piped in from Antarctica. If you miss country folk you can head about  mins east of town and say yall and bless your heart all you want and people wont think too much about it. Like littlegacemcgoo said people dont automatically assume you are Christian and there isnt a church on every corner. The most unsolicited harassment you will get is from solar salesman in every home improvement store you go to and knocking on your front door if you live in a house. Gas is more expensive registration and fees are crazy and you have to pay to use almost every outdoor recreation area  get used to California getting theirs no matter what you do. It is really a cool place though no regrets moving here and I hope you dont have any either!        ,Sacramento,cyh39pu,3,t5_2qi09

6301901,0,t1_cz5v17t,Disclaimer super complicated issue and Im just spitballing here. Thats the thing. The issue isnt just finding a big enough gymnasium to put a bunch of cots in. Its about getting people in respectable housing where theyll actually stick around long enough to get established get a better relationship with social services and longterm transition back into a more normal life. Which also leads to the questions of How do you pay for that? Where do you put it? Proper apartments downtown are just really expensive Hotel Berry Im looking at you. Not saying its not worth paying for just that itll be really pricey to house a significant number of people. Modular houses like the demo house on th St are pretty affordable so could be an answer to the first question but still have issues with the second question. That lot on th and C is a good location assuming security and sanitation are taken care of but even so its probably not going to make any nearby residents too happy. And thats realistically only going to fit probably  houses. Youd need hundreds to really start to make a dent in that. Tent cities are even cheaper of course and I think the city is too hasty to nix that idea. You still have issues with finding an appropriate property but it would be really nice to have a little more flexibilitymaybe something where they dont have to apply and get on a waiting list for housing they could just show up by a certain time on a given night. Police could roust river campers in good conscious and maybe even give them a ride to a proper camp with toilets and running water. ,Sacramento,cz5ydyn,12,t5_2qi09

People like to think that racism is this small or abnormal thing in society when it is literally everywhere in almost every aspect of our culture our laws and day to day life.It amazes me how quickly people try to dismiss racism as if pretending its not there makes it go away. Allegations of racism should always be given the benefit of the doubt. That is to say we ought to be siding with the victims or at least remain neutral rather than try to dismiss the reality that we live in a very racist prowhite culture. Sure in some few cases the allegations are false but considering our grandparents generation used to lynch Blacks when they felt like it...Id say more often than not a claim of racism or discrimination is valid.Also...other white people. No one can be racist toward you in the US. If you believe in racism toward whites or reverse racism just dont talk.

9428529,0,t1_d9aey2j,Something is relevant if it changes the truth value of a statement.My statement basically said that a citation isnt needed since it is a well known fact that a passport can be used as a form of ID. Your counter example tried to negate my statement by saying most people know that murder is bad yet I can cite the penal code.  Thats cool but do most people need to know CPC to not commit murder?  No.  Do they need to know what intent and physical activity is required to be proven guilty of murder?  No.  It is a well known fact that murder is simply bad. Similarly it is a well known fact that a passport can be used as a form of ID at a bar.  Do people need to know the specific law that allows them to use it as an ID?  No.  In this light your statement is relevant to my dipshit answer. So you are correct that it is relevant. However it is not relevant to OPs question. The law that prohibits murder is not the same law that allows passports to be used as IDs at bars.  ,Sacramento,d9b4pv8,2,t5_2qi09

Be concise on the app. Is your resume have a lot of info or are you going for an OT type position? If a large resume put keyword details in  and at end put see resume for further examples and details. If you have limited information then get wordy. Put anything that seems like it would relate to the job even voluntary work.  Look through the job announcement and figure out keywords make sure to litter them throughout your resume.Biggest thing people forget for mid level positions such as SSA put down you know Office! Dont just say Office though say WordExcelOutlook.Last when you get an interview dont say shit like my resume says what I know. State interviews are points based on keywords.

11380906,0,t3_628zrh,I used to live in Old North Sacramento. I would avoid any neighborhood north of the river except for the North Natomas area. All the areas you mentioned have high rates of personal and property crime as well as a whole host of undesirable behavior such as homelessness prostitution illegal dumping etc.The city does not give a single iota of care to what happens in these areas of town. There is no money to be made in north Sacramento so there is no development. These areas have basically become the dumping ground for undesirable city and county services such as homeless clinics and probation department offices. Woodlake being the exception to this rule. But this neighborhood is almost all owner occupied and commands a premium in price. South Natomas used to be a pretty nice part of town but over time has been on a downward trend of higher crime. Not all of it is bad but the are pockets of the area that are not very nice. If you want to be more involved in the art scene while maintaining a close commute I would recommend North Oak Park area. Tahoe Park to the east is nice. South of the city Hollywood Park is a nice neighborhood it frequently is featured at the top of the list in neighborhood rankings. These are all older neighborhoods with smaller homes mature trees and strong neighborhood organizations. I have lived in just about every corner of the Sacramento metro area so if you have any questions about an area feel free to ask. ,Sacramento,dfm08vv,1,t5_2qi09

11437064,0,t1_dfsbtrt,To me the worst thing about rent control is that it leads to underground economies where the tenant with the rent control can lock in a rate and then turn around and profit off of the delta between their rent control rate and fair market rate by illegally subletting rooms in the house.  The tenant makes the profit off the building while the owner is still responsible for maintenance and repairs.  ,Sacramento,dfsdp10,17,t5_2qi09

A place where people can go after hours thats safe and fun. Lastly have you been to Capitol Casino? Its in a generally terrible area.

Why invite Chief Caleen Sisk who will likely just be speaking against the Delta Tunnels and the Dakota Access Pipeline both of which are very proscience projects and the objections thereof are decidedly antiscience as he always does?  The director of Move to Amend which is solely focused on repealing Citizens United which has absolutely nothing at all to do with science.  Mayor Patterson who will likely speak out against oil companies without much or any? science background.  Reem Al Olaby who I assume was chosen almost exclusively because shes a female muslim for political reasons rather than her contributions to science.  Then theres I assume Elizabeth Hadly flyer spells it Hadley which kind of goes to show their attention to detail and Mark Brown who I guess I am excited to see.I really really really hope they keep this proscience and not antiTrump.
