2777778,0,t3_2rss3q,Well by definition a singularity is essential iff its Laurent sequence has non vanishing coefficients with arbitrarily large negative indices. The geometrical interpretation of this property is that essential singularities are points where a function goes batshit insane. More formally if a is an essential singularity point of f and E is an open environment of a then fEa is almost the entire complex plane i.e. it is the entire complex plane except maybe a single point this is called Picards greater theorem. This implies for example that for any complex number c there is a sequence cn gt a with fcnc for all n. This is very contrary to the fact that poles always approach an infinite magnitude i.e. if a was a pole then cn gt a would imply that |fcn| gt infinity.,elimath,cnjto5x,3,t5_35q4a
