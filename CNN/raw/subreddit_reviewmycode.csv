According to my professor the console window should only say Press any key to continue... But after running it the report file should be filled with the sorted information. ,reviewmycode,cfz4c7i,1,t5_2rj5y

In the Readme it refers to setting your BOTID in heroku in the var config. What you actually want to set is your BOTID.Me and roommate were looking everywhere in the code to try and figure out the problem then I saw var botID  process.env.BOTID and realized that maybe it wanted that underscore in heroku.For us at least changing the config var name from BOTID to BOTID got it to start running when it wouldnt before.Only other thing Ive noticed it is seems like it will crash and need redeployed to heroku if it receives a handful of fetch requests at once that it cant find a gif for. Havent tested that one too heavily yet though.,reviewmycode,d2kwav9,1,t5_2rj5y
8769918,0,t3_4zpq0w,Awesome idea mate  like sometimes you just wanna wip up a quick one pager to show the boss a concept! Its highly inefficient for any production use! But yeah man been looking for something quick! Be good to get a suite of something like pug scss and coffeescript all within the browser with maybe a boilerplate html we can just download that bootstraps it all?,reviewmycode,d71wkix,2,t5_2rj5y
10963130,0,t3_5ukk0b,This looks more than C code to be honest. Consider using stdarrayltclass T sizet Ngt rather than raw pointers for arrays. It will you allow you to use a for range loop and also pass iterators to the first and last elements in the stdarray rather than passing the indexes of the start and end of the int  array.,reviewmycode,dearps7,1,t5_2rj5y
