7326556,0,t3_4fpwzm,I would like to moderate this subreddit because I love having meta discussions about Reddit. Ive played WoW through every iteration and think that rwow is a genuinely good community. Although it is going through growing pains at the moment a place like this would help facilitate that transition. Meta discussion doesnt really have a place right now and removing some of the clutter from the flagship sub would be appropriate. Ive been subbed to rwow since the start of MoP but on other accounts. One thing I like is that actual news usually makes it to the first few pages making it a good place to see news. One thing I dislike is that it has become more of an echo chamber in comment threads although thats not really something that can be modded away in a largely organic community. I have no previous mod experience. I have had many awkward run ins with the mod team.Edit I once also had a thread I created stickied on rwowcirclejerk for four whole months.Edit  I have never used the mod toolbox but would be willing to learn. Im assuming this is where I bill my shill hours and it prints me money to spend at the company store.,wowmeta,d2az9j5,1,t5_2uzsc
