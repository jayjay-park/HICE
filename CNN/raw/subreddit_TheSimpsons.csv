147328,0,t1_ceuypta,They play the show theme on a loop along with a more mellow theme so you wont go psychotic but the volume is low and its not something intrusive with all the hubbub you cant really hear anything anyway.There are some sound effects two which come to mind are Chief Wiggums car which honks a horn every now and then and right next to KwikEMart theres a payphone that rings at random times. If you pick it up you can hear one of the characters telling a little joke one that I remember now is Selma asking you if you found her purse and if you did to take her phone number from inside and call her.Coming from the Krustyland side there are sounds like a carnival being piped through and there are several carnival games which have their own sound effects but again nothing intrusive.There are also a few TVs spread around inside KwikEMart at Duff Gardens etc and these play show clips on a loop which are relevant to that location so theres that noise going on too. The area itself is very small you could walk across all of it in less than  minutes so these sounds keep changing.,TheSimpsons,cev7mn5,1,t5_2rhs5

2582409,0,t1_cmvmndu,gta certain race of peoples pronunciation of a word racist? I guess assuming that people pronounce words based on their race is a pretty good definition of racism huh?  But racism isnt overtly saying one race is better than the other nor is it necessarily limited to the alwaysalready racist biological division of humanity into subspecies based on skin tonefacial features. Its about stereotyping and pathologizing what the racist sees as different. In this case making fun of Asians saying their Ls and Rs wrong is an old racist trope and is based more on American Orientalist stereotypes than any sort of raciallylinked linguistic phenomena. And when people talk about Asian accents or whatever thats also demonstrating that cant distinguish between say Korean Uyghur Mongolian Chinese Vietnamese Tagalog Japanese etc. as languages or as ethnic groups since theyre all quite different. And most Americans cant read  let alone pronounce it so I think its fair to say this sort of stereotyping is based on the assumption of linguistic dominance of English.,TheSimpsons,cmvnpfk,-1,t5_2rhs5

Television of article  Callback comedy sfw gtIn television the term callback has come to mean a joke or line that refers to a previous episode or sometimes in rare cases movies. Particularly in earlier sitcoms  though even until the early s callbacks were rare and often frowned upon by networks because they threaten to isolate a viewer who is new to the series or who missed episodes. Seinfeld was one of the first sitcoms to regularly use callbacks in its scripts although on a level which would often be missed or disregarded by viewers. More recently  Rock has employed callbacks to reference fictitious movies and television programs created within the show. Arrested Development became well known by fans for its regular use of callbacks throughout all of its episodes.  Of course the line between a callback and simple continuity can be ambiguous.

3146010,0,t1_conrrvu,Im glad to see this started a good discussion.  I think Mr. Burns stupidity comes from a combination of being old and senile along with his general ignorance of modern common peoples culture.  This also comes from being old but is also a product of his rich lifestyle separating him from the common tasks and knowledge of average people.  Perhaps he was more like Stewie when he was younger.  A good friend of mine thinks Stewie is a reincarnated WW veteran.  He uses the example where Stewie refers to a WW era fighter plane and says something like They dont make them like they used to.

4037644,0,t1_crg9j0r,I seem to recall reading something where one of the producers talked about that. While they were ok with the Klasky style animation for season  as thats all they could get to do it they really didnt want The Simpsons to be that zany overlyanimated cartoon they wanted things to be a bit more realistic. As the concept grew in to more of a s style sitcom with the large cast of characters...they didnt feel it was working for them.Klasky on the other hand...felt that all animation needed to be crudely overanimated. Its fine for childrens cartoons but that was not what they wanted for The Simpsons which was a primetime adulttargeted cartoon. Klasky kind of refused to animate it how they wanted so the producers found someone who animated it the way they wanted.I actually look at the first three seasons and think its crude and overly animated compared to what came out in the mid to late s which fit the style of the show better IMO. You had just enough unbelievably for it to be a cartoon without objects like a paper bag looking like a hunk of jello. Its all because they wanted some realism and not  kiddiecartoon.  ,TheSimpsons,crgisy4,21,t5_2rhs5

4521696,0,t1_ct0gtha,gtSpanish colonists noted the use of the hammock by Native Americans particularly in the West Indies at the time of the Spanish conquest. The word comes from a Tano culture Arawakan word Haiti meaning fish net. Early hammocks were woven out of bark from a hamack tree and later this material was replaced by sisal fibers because it was more abundant. One of the reasons that hammocks became popular in Central and South America was their ability to provide safety from disease transmission insect stings or animal bites. By suspending their beds above ground inhabitants were better protected from snakes biting ants and other harmful creatures. ,TheSimpsons,ct0lmtr,8,t5_2rhs5

6034998,1,t1_cyaldij,The free advertisement argument is so selfserving people can convince themselves that any shitty thing they do is actually good if they try hard enough.  Ive even heard it apply to pirating software and music.  Im doing you a favour by experiencing it for free against your wishes. Hahah yeah thats what the  software devs needed  you to steal their hard work from The Pirate Bay so you can tell your three shitty friends to torrent it too.For the record Ive torrented and stuff like that mostly when I was younger and before I started trying to produce software myself but the big difference is I never tried to convince myself it was for the greater good.,TheSimpsons,cyapbq5,-2,t5_2rhs5

10845811,0,t3_5v1637,K Im just going to rant for a bit. Feel free to ignore. I dont care about downvotes. Yes I do and I will shamefully delete this later.You know what Lisa? Cry me a fucking river. I dont give a shit about some shitty hat you found at a store. It was just a hat and while you did get some attention for it its a fucking hat. One you only had for a few hours.Remember when your tiger bit Barts arm and he used his charity money to make an animal sanctuary for you instead of fixing his arm? He ended his career for you. Or how about the time that he gave up his hall monitor career to save your skin after YOU stole text books? Or how you told him not to blame you for every setback in life when he could have been a way more successful moral and happy person if he didnt sacrifice things for you? Remember the time he used his lawsuit money to buy you that rare Bleeding Gums Murphy album? Sure you didnt do anything wrong that time but thats such a big gesture that you should forgive him for throwing away a dumb hat.So yeah fuck this story. I know its about Barts guilt and hes still a good enough person to feel guilt and sympathy for this horrible little troll. But if this situation were the other way around Bart would STILL be kissing her ass. Im just glad that Lisas conscienceguilt finally caught up to her even if it was a  second thing.One thing I did like though Lisa told Bart to forget about her and move on to Maggie. Take her advice Bart. Interacting with Lisa is like pulling teeth. Shell either nag and force her morals on you complain about how unpopular she is or be a huge bitch.Moving on from Lisa to the Bplot. I missed it why was Homer quitting Chess? Also Magnus sounds so wooden. They REALLY need to get celebrity cameos from actors who can at least act a little better.,TheSimpsons,ddyo3ny,40,t5_2rhs5
