10403863,0,t3_5oz36c,Partners have an official and legally binding relationship with Atlassian. Depending on their level  tier they can make a commission on license sales that they help customers with. I am not  sure what the old tiers were based on but if you go to  you can see the PDF they offer which outlines the requirements. These requirements are having a certain number of staff that are officially certified by Atlassian and driving a certain amount of sales revenue.Some companies that provide Atlassian services are not official partners. For example my company Atlas Authority helps a number of large firms but we have no formal relationship with Atlassian. Though after working there for  years I am on pretty good terms with a lot of the staff.As for getting started it really depends on how your company is doing things. In many substantial companies the way that Atlassian tools come into play is that some small team picks it up and then it grows and eventually IT takes it over. At this point it is already a bit of a mess and typically you bring in someone external to help clean this up.If you browse various forums you will sometimes see that users talk about how much they hate the tools while others extol their virtues. My opinion on this divide is that their experience with the tool has a lot to do with how it is set up. If you want to architect a broad deployment from nothing and you have never worked with JIRA I highly recommend you hire a firm that is experienced in it. Or you can bring on a full time employee  contractor who has  years of experience where their day to day was  Atlassian tools.Feel free to reach out to me on here or via my website if you want to talk through this further.,jira,dcncffr,2,t5_2qic8
