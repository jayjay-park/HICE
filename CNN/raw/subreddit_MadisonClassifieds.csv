9010766,0,t1_d7swd7n,There is parking for one car underground in a designated spot.  There is ample street parking in front that is only enforced ampm every day except Sunday. You need to move by AM  hr parking if on the street. There is a good chance there might be more spots from the apartment probably under  a month. I can find out for oyu. I can offer  off the first month now. You could also do a  month lease if you would like. I am very willing to work something out. I actually logged into this throaway after seeing your post.,MadisonClassifieds,d7uyc69,1,t5_37rp4
