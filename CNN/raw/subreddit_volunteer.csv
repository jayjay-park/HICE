654768,0,t1_cge91a6,There is a VA home near us and I am sure they would love her and she would love them.  She is good that way.  But I am trying to impress on her that not everyone is as fortunate as our family and that we have a responsibility to help others.  My wife and I make regular donations to women shelters and food pantries but Writing checks is not going to make an impression on a young child.  But a senior home may still be the best fit.  After all a smile can be as important as a meal sometimes.,volunteer,cgep3os,1,t5_2qzis

3888602,0,t1_cqzihvc,Oh sorry! Thats my misreading. Well Ill say this I didnt have many developed skills. I held loads of jobs all from the age of thirteen but nothing that could bud into a career. Then after working in loads of kitchens around the globe I came back with the basis for a chefs CV. As I mentioned I returned because of divorce. So when I picked up a job at a little restaurant I distracted myself with work. I worked hard. Then as the company grew so did my position. I was able to move for a new opening due to not really having roots in Manchester and then stuck with it for the promotions! In university I wanted to be a professor now Im the head chef of a burger joint. Its crazy but I love it.My advice would be to consider your current experience. I have a friend who always said Im so jealous of your travels. But I say to him Im so jealous you stuck with your runner job considering youre now assistant camera operator on Dr Who. I think I got lucky to be honest. So look at your current experience ans see if it ks robust to extend travel time.,volunteer,cqzj8yh,3,t5_2qzis

Not sure if they take international applications though.You could always post on whatever the local version of Kijiji  Craigslist is and take payments via paypal? Or ask computer sales and repair counter at local universities if they do any remote work and want to hire you. Maybe put posters up there too to advertise your repairs.I wish you luck finding a job. rITcareerquestions might have leads for the Baltic area. ,volunteer,d35hxml,1,t5_2qzis
8320582,0,t3_4tfa5g,I did this with my local nursing home when I was in middle school.  We wrote letters to someone we were paired with the whole year and then we went to visit them as a field trip towards the end of the year.  It was an amazing experience.  You can probably organize this with a group through your local nursing home or you can ask and see if they know a resident that you could just do this with who could benefit from something like this.  It is a really amazing experience that changes the lives of both people! I work in a nursing home and it makes me so sad to see that some of the residents never get any visitors.  I know that they would love being able to do this with someone. ,volunteer,d5hmnd1,1,t5_2qzis
