ATier champions are easy to play and easy to fit on a team while being strong. BTier champions are sometimes easy to play sometimes a bit trickier usually easy to fit on a team and range from decent to strong. Ctier champions tend to either be hard to play andor fit on a team or they have enough flaws to make them situational. Dtier champions tend to be weak while STier champions are overpowered. I recommend mainly playing ATier and BTier champions although CTier champions can certainly be viable if you know what youre doingif you dont get counterpicked by the enemy team in blind pick.

6485123,0,t1_czq3cq2,The thing about Dead Mans Plate on tanks is that generally you wont be able to stack the slow with your cc. Most major tanks will have a cceffect on their first autoattack like Leonas Q or Nautilus passive thus making the slow from DMP less valuable. Sometimes youll want the extra mobility its quite good on say Tahm Kench sometimes youd be better off getting tankier items.Abyssal and Moonflair are mainly for tanky APs although I could see Moonflair being a good way to get lots of tenacity vs a tenacityheavy team. They work better on tanks that scale well with AP such as Nautilus and Amumu.Locket Before its finished youre behind a bit yeah. Aegis makes you weaker in v and v situations compared to other items but its still quite good in v and v and Kindlegem sacrifices some tankiness for  CDR though its a good item. Its not an item you need to rush. It is also true that youre weaker individually although the active is not to be underestimated.,LoLDominion,czq3yr8,1,t5_2vpdd
