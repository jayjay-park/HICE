817376,0,t3_23gkd3,We run a mix of sentries and vultures on all maps and weve found that as long as you use them correctly you get the benefits of both. Medics running vultures should be standard for that extra protection while running around healing. We put a few sentry guns in corners or in mayday we make a circle of them pointing in and then we stay in the middle shooting out. Its surprising how easy it is to complete all the hives in the gas plant with this method. Sentries can be destroyed easily but you can combat this by pointing guns at each other to cover themselves. Then you can mostly ignore them during waves and they will be fine. They have become rhino magnets on nightfall lately though. ,CODAliens,cgx6srj,1,t5_2ypad

1214863,0,t3_280qtk,I try to avoid destroying the healing flowers and instead focus on repeatedly smashing him with Venom X. If your stocked up on Venom X you should be able to stun him and beat him before he can heal unless your really unlucky.Nightfall is the one I have solod the least because it is my least favorite but thats how Ive done it. A vulture or Sentry guns should make good cover while your focusing on him.,CODAliens,ci6ah23,2,t5_2ypad
1235922,0,t3_2885m4,I mostly play solo so the Weapon Specialist works well. Killing cryptids faster with quicker reload is always good. Engineer is great on PoC nothing better than having  while spamming traps but I dont find it as useful on Nightfall or Mayday. Medic isnt great on solo and the Tank class sucks.,CODAliens,ci8nowj,3,t5_2ypad
1254871,0,t1_ciae9ay,Ya the engineer upgrade is pretty much useless. It stops scouts and hunters from entering but Pods gas and rhinos can still mess your day up. ,CODAliens,ciasdoj,1,t5_2ypad
1298735,0,t1_cifk86l,Thats a good start but I would try a single fire weapon just to make it easier to count. If you had a teammate stand there with a riot shield the rhino wouldnt move around or attack you. Im on  though.,CODAliens,cifq3a8,1,t5_2ypad

1703523,0,t3_2dt8of,I find that Sentry gun is more helpful than many of the other strike packages up until this point. The gargoyles coming out really makes the Vulture Shine. Fully upgraded it relieves some pressure on you so that you can prioritize your targets. That and making sure you drop multiple sets of sticky flares in the are so that you can throw some and pick another set up immediately.  ,CODAliens,cjtw3bd,1,t5_2ypad

2086558,0,t1_ckyumcp,I would agree that the class upgrades are definitely worth it. Although I have all of them I almost never play as Tank and not too often as an Engineer so I have used the Medic and Weapon Specialist class upgrades a lot more. Both are extremely useful as has already been mentioned. Ive played many games where there may be anywhere between  and  people down at the same time and you can totally save the game by activating your Medic class upgrade or deploying medgas as it says ingame and running to each player instantly reviving them. You dont have to sit there and wait for the progress bar as you try and revive each one. Sometimes it comes in handy when you just need to get someone back in action real fast because a lot of shit is going on at the moment and you dont want to risk your life saving theirs rhinos mammoths attacking etc. It is worth noting that if someone bleeds out all the way where it goes to just their dog tags as opposed to them being in last stand where they can still shoot and crawl around your class upgrade will not work on them. You will have to revive them the old fashioned way.The Weapon Specialist upgrade is great for large enemies or even if you just get in a bind and are out of ammo and need some instantly. You get that firehose of unlimited ammo without reload for as long as the effect lasts which is around  seconds I believe. Good stuff.,CODAliens,cl51pwa,2,t5_2ypad
