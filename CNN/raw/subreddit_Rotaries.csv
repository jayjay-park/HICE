1042841,0,t1_chmrj53,The rotors from the BREW are basically the same as every other B including the renesis.  If its just for furniture you can use any of them. And to add a A rotor is just skinnier.  The triangular dimensions are the same. ,Rotaries,chmtqb5,1,t5_2sklk
1124158,0,t1_chvm3n4,Id have a pretty good belt on there and stout enough pullies with coarse threads to move them.  I grew up on a farm and our combine had a pretty big fucking belt on it that must have been taking  hp.  The idea here is that the tire and belt grip are pretty much the same and hopefully I break the tires loose before the belt slips.,Rotaries,chw2rr7,2,t5_2sklk
1483944,0,t1_cj29bx1,I was planning on a full time setup because it would be my fun car.  Id be driving this on gravel most of the time so sound wouldnt be an issue.  I like the idea of a rotary rally car.  Id even drive it in the winter provided that I seal everything up good so it doesnt rust out.,Rotaries,cj2adgj,2,t5_2sklk
1972429,0,t1_ckqs58i,Im actually getting it cuz they said they were going to throw it out but I said Id be very interested in taking it. Im not sure what Ill be doing with it but Ill definitely keep it for a few years. I might use it to help with an undergrad thesis about rotaries but thats still a few years away.,Rotaries,ckqvmm2,2,t5_2sklk

7317149,0,t1_d29u8so,There are some very thorough walk through posted online.. There are far fewer moving parts in a rotary. Im not sure exactly what the actual issue was with the early Renesis engines though I would look that up first before deciding whether to do it yourself. ,Rotaries,d29ws0f,1,t5_2sklk
7629707,0,t1_d39cnug,Im not sure exactly I know that you want somewhere in the area of  or so on a good engine and diesel is something like  so yeah that may be a bit of an engineering problem but Im sure it can be done ,Rotaries,d39gg85,2,t5_2sklk
7716922,0,t3_4kv2kf,If buying a rotary is important to you and if you have a good setup with the rest of your life a good stable affordable living situation no other high expenses and that this will stay true once you graduate and if you have a career path picked out with high demand and a good earning potential go for it. Given your age I would caution you against spending too much money on a car if youre going to be supporting yourself in a few years. Cars are cool just dont sink all of your money into a car and end up having to live in itsell it at a huge loss on Kijiji because you need the money for an unexpected expense. Check rpersonalfinancecanada and start planning.As mentioned the naturally aspirated rotaries are a lot more reliable than the boosted versions. Keep this in mind. The Rx isnt a bad option either. Budget for repairs to make the car pass an safety inspection as well as the cost of a safety inspection. Keep in mind that youre going to be paying through the nose for insurance because youre a young male driving a  door vehicle that maintenance is going to be significant due to driving a  year old vehicle and that it might not be terribly reliable as a daily. Rotaries are expensive to run due to fuel costs as well dont forget.Remember that there are only a few places that will work on rotaries especially old ones. Parts can be hard to source. Based on your post history it looks like youre in Van so youll probably be ok as far as finding a decent rotary shop but do some research and find out how close the nearest rotary shop is and what their reputation is like. Find out how much a tow will be for a worst case scenario. Price out tools and an engine lift  stand if youre going to be doing maintenance and rebuilds yourself. If you are hoping to selfmaintain price out accommodations with a garage vs. without since in Van this will drastically affect housing costs.,Rotaries,d3jd0gf,2,t5_2sklk
