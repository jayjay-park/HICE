Since it is evident that artistic method is concerned with pisteis and since pistis is a sort of demonstration apodeixis for we most believe when we suppose something to have been demonstrated and since rhetorical apodeixis is enthymeme and this is generally speaking the strongest of the pisteis and the enthymeme is a sort of syllogism and it is a function of dialectic either as a whole or one of its parts to see about every syllogism equally it is clear that he who is best able to see from what materials and how a syllogism arises would also be most enthymematic if he grasps also what sort of things an enthymeme is concerned with and what differences it has from a logical syllogism for it belongs to the same capacity both to see the true and what resembles the true and at the same time humans have a natural disposition for the true and to a large extent hit on the truth thus an ability to aim at commonly held opinions endoxa is a characteristic of one who also has a similar ability in regard to the truth. .The commentary for this particular sentence implies it is an important one yet I initially did not understand a word of it. It is difficult because of its style I wish I had more background in logic and dialectic but mostly because of the unknown Greek terms. Thus a definition of the Greek terms is a good place to start to understand the sentence. Pisteis is defined as a proof belief or state of mind. Apodeixis means capable of demonstration so a piesteis apodeixis is a proof backed up by demonstration. Enthymeme for Aristotle is an argument in which one premise is not explicitly stated so it is like an incomplete syllogism.  Now that the terms are defined I believe Aristotle is saying that a rhetorical apodeixis can be an enthymeme which can lead one to a syllogism. Later on in the reading this becomes significant. In the case of persuasion through proving or seeming to prove something just as in dialectic there is on the one hand induction and on the other the syllogism and the apparent syllogism so the situation is similar in rhetoric for if the paradeigma example is an induction the enthymma is a syllogism. I call a rhetorical syllogism an enthymeme a rhetorical induction a paradigm. And all speakers produce logical persuasion by means of paradigms or enthymemes and by nothing other than these. As a result since it is always necessary to show something either by syllogizing or by inducing and this is clear to us from the Analytics it is necessary that each of these be the same as each of the others. . What the difference is between a paradigm and an enthymeme is clear from the Topics for an account was given there earlier of syllogism and induction to show on the basis of many similar instances that something is so is in dialectic induction in rhetoric paradigm but to show that if some premises are true something else the conclusion beyond them results from these because they are true either universally or for the most part in dialectic is called syllogism and in rhetoric enthymeme. . And it is also apparent that either species of rhetoric has merit what has also been said in the Methodics is true in these cases too for some rhetorical utterances are paradigmatic some enthymematic and similarly some orators are paradigmatic some enthymematic. Speeches using paradigms are not less persuasive but those with enthymemes excite more favorable audience reaction .This passage is also difficult due to the terms used and the dense style of writing. It is easier to understand after having analyzed the first passage. I believe Aristotle is comparing rhetoric to dialectic just as dialectic is divided into induction and syllogism a form of deduction rhetoric is divided into paradigm which is similar to induction and the enthymma which is similar to a syllogism. While both methods of rhetoric have merit orators using enthymemes will excite a more favorable audience reaction than those basing their arguments on paradigms. This is similar to dialectic though both induction and deduction have merit it is deductive arguments that usually hold more weight.,rhetoricanddemocracy,cuu8aii,3,t5_39t1e
