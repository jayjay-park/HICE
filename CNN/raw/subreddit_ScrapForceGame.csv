6551041,0,t1_czwuik1,I just played it and had a pretty ideal line up.  I couldnt beat it.  the  per turn is just too much.  Ill have to try with getting a yuko out but the damage comes so quick and heavy its really tough.  I ran a double Stella double Savannah team comp and i got to a point where I was able to kill all the enemy troops and deal damage to Ariel but having to constantly bring out Savannah eventually killed me.  I understand your frustration and feel lucky that I was able to max out all my raid heroes prior to any change.  Maybe the devs will take a look and once again and reexamine the difficulty for both Master and Legendary.  To me it doesnt really make sense to make a raid so unobtainable unless you have the other  star heroes.  The level  Dungar stage has also frustrated me even worse than this Ariel raid.,ScrapForceGame,czwxjif,1,t5_38hdd
