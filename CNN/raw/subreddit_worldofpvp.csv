You can burst there too with the smoke bomb idea just save your dark soul and then reapply max rank dots  your drain ... make sure you switch to drain soul at  or lower.  Also run coil instead of shadow fury when with a rogue you dont want to DR those stuns.  The beauty of the coil is you can use it to assist in the burn process in the smoke bombRogue drops smoke and you start to go for the kill your healer helps with cc of targetshealer...if for whatever reason the cc breaks or they happen to trinket you can coil that target instantly.  You dont have to cover over them with the green circle you just hit your macro and the coil goes out.  Its a more reliable cc and it works on warriors DAlso weve had much more luck running with a warrior than a rogue.

This problem only becomes bigger since other classes currently scale better with gear than rogues.    PvP  If you enjoy BGs... well then it sucks to be rogue.    Arena.

2874998,0,t3_2t0tq2,In my opinion the best addon for you isSurvival hunter. The cc they have more than makes up for the dks lack of it. They will pull more consistent damage less burst more overall than bm which is a good pair with dk burst. Afflic lock. Who doesnt love afflic locks in v. They have consistent damage on everyone with cc and better survivability than hunter. UA is also helpful so your dots dont get dispelled. Warrior. A classic combo of kick ass. This is probably the least surviveable combo but the way warriors are now you should be able to nuke someone in a short amount of time. The key is constant switching and timed burst. Ret. This is one of the weaker burst comps because ret pally burst has a  min cd but when its up its very good. Also pally utilities freedom bop and off heals make it a lot more survivable than warrior. Last is something not as well know but is proven to be very good. BOOMY. Cyclone and with a dk you dont have to worry too much about being kited. Very strong combo that can nuke you in a second.

3807953,0,t1_cqpndhx,um yea I do know that about the armory... Im not a moron. Also no your right I dont know every single glad arena master or rank one. But Im in a guild with many arena masters and a few glads that I have asked and not one of them uses tree so again your wrong. I also watch pretty much every rank  rdruid who streams and again not even one of them uses tree form. I dont understand why you are arguing with me tree form is so easily countered its not even funny. Most dps classes other then rets and ferals have burst up before tree form comes back. Going to use facing tsg in s as an example. Warr pops avitar dk pops maybe one cd not full burst that will probably force tree. Then in roughly about a minute the warrior has avitar back so he pops that with the rest of dk burst and your dead. Also I didnt face roll comp to above k I actually played rdruid dk which in my opinion warrior rdruid is better because of warriors more frequent burst and mobility. Also if your not facing feral ret there is absoltely no reason to need to take tree for ret wings. If your a druid and cant kite a ret around when he has wings up there I somthing wrong. kyleey if she takes tree form every game or for most games Im sorry but things are going to keep going the way they are. A smart team will see that she is using it almost immidetely no soul of the forest buff on the druid after a min or  of watching and they will counter it. But as far as helping with the peeling goes when I play with my dk partner for example. Lets say theres another warrior on me as soon as he pops avitar my dk turns around and stuns him most of the time of the warrior has trinket up hes going to use it right there but right when my dk stuns him Im casting clone if he reflects thats fine he cant hit me and my dk has defensives. If he stuns me Ill trinket if needed and displace around a corner. Your druid just needs to clone more Im guessing also bash. Bash or even roar for double Melee is a really good self peel especially because if they trinket that dk stun you can bash then clone to dr and there goes the burst. Im not going to argue with Ekrank anymore if you want to listen to him and continue using tree form when its a bad cd for anything other then ret feral double feral or I guess warrior feral then thats your choice and I wish you luck. But if you want to play like any druid with real rating just get used to using soul for almost every game. You ca even practice in skirmishes Untill you get it down. Quick tip to get your druid healing from low or a partner first way if NS is off cd you can swift mendNSregrowth. Thats about a k heal or more. If NS is on cd then swiftmend double rejuv genesis. That is about a k hot over  seconds. If your really worried and you do that with heart popped then its about k hot over  seconds. For moderate damage use swiftmend then hard cast regrowth for about a k heal but make sure she doesnt get kicked or moderate damage can turn into scary damage. ,worldofpvp,cqqc51m,-1,t5_2wbvb

5200831,0,t3_3m80zo,This is the main reason I avoid v on my warrior. Its fun on my rogue or hunter but warrior v is pretty mind numbing. Warrior on its own has very little sustainability. You can go glad stance spec and play with a dps paladin druid or monk and you can survive with some off heals and set up some burst kills. Even there other double dps comps or dpshealer comps will have the advantage. I use my warrior to carry healers for gold or to carry friends who want to gear up their healers. I do not put any sort of value on my v rating because v is broken which Blizzard acknowledges so you will feel the worst of class imbalances and crappy mechanics. WoW is simply not designed for v combat. Comps like magerogue can take advantage of this which is why it is viable pretty much every season. So yeah if you dont like warriorhealer with Arms or Fury then I would just ignore v all together and play a class that is capable of running double dps. Or just avoid v all together and focus on BG and vv. ,worldofpvp,cvcw64h,2,t5_2wbvb

5384879,0,t1_cvzsviz,Perhaps youve misunderstood what they are doing to classes and races for PvP. Think of it as a different system to what it is now they are stripping racial abilities from my understanding and are basically bringing everything back to alignment.They are removing trinkets and class sets they are removing armor sets etc. The classes will be balanced as it will now be completely separate from PvE aspect of the game. They suggested that spells that werent addedremoved intofrom the game would be added etc  its apparently going to be redesigned in such a way that it will be able to be balanced.Now while most of this is hype and nothing else has been said upon this I do agree with some of your sentiments. Currently its not based on skill but class and luck. What legion will provide is unknown they say it will be balanced so I am going off what theyve promised  Now I know their promises are essentially bogus at this stage but Im going to give them the benefit of the doubt.,worldofpvp,cvzz90f,0,t5_2wbvb

Another option would be to join a pvp guild tag along in premade random battlegrounds and they will carry you to wins which gets you honorepic loot boxes. That can gear you pretty damn quick. Once you are in honor gear s grind is the quickest way to conquest as well as a decent way to learn your class. Keep an open mind avoid ragey  players seriously they are the worst if you can and try not to get too flustered at losses.

Resto druids are barely viable in this current season and theyre only viable in RMD skilless comps TSG Walking dead Turbo or with god tier LSD players.Boomkin on the other hand can be played in a wide variety of comps in s amp s and on top of that every successful RBG team needs a Boomkin who can keep Starfall at a guarenteed  uptime while heshe is alive.  In Legion Resto Druids will no longer be viable in ANY comps just like in Cata but Boomkins on the other hand will be one of the very few viable caster DPS specs.Dont be like me I have played Resto since BC and only began to branch out during Season  when Rdruids were being replaced because they were directly countered by RMP and Cata information was getting released we found out about the state of rdruids in Cata. Basically I got nerfed out of the game and forced into either completely quitting the game or rerolling. Its happened to me several times most of the time I have just quit playing the game until Blizzard balances it out again. I quit playing in late WoD S because of the information being released about the upcoming patches most of the people on this reddit told me I was an idiot this time last year when I told them they werent going to fix combat rogues but instead nerf rdruids out of the game...

Against a target dummy ret might be even or higher than enhance but the amount of control that can affect ret alongside ret having to give up its dps to heal means that in an actual fight enhance will do more consistent damage. Also enhance does much better aoe in those situations. Someone said that enhance does more burst damage but I disagree. Double windstrike does take a chunk outta the enemy but holy avenger  wings is like unlimited windstrikes.

8352345,0,t3_4tykgh,How long did you experiment with the talents? One day?   Arms is the spec to go in PvP you NEED defensive stance if youre not using it youre doing it wrong. Also ALWAYS use victory rush when its up theres no other way we can heal Second Wind is meh Id rather sit and eat a mage cake to heal than wasting a talent.   Take Overpower it procs faster than you think. Put it in a priority higher than Mortal Strike in your rotation.   From here its your decision to go with Slam bleed or Focused Rage just dont take Mortal Combo it just screws up with your rotation and drains your rage so fast that your executes will hit like a baby.   My personal pick was Focused Rage because its not on your global cooldown so if your Colossus Smash is on cooldown just hit this to store the rage until your Colossus Smash is back up for the next nuke.   Ive never liked Slam Arms needs the rage for executes and to spread damage on different targets apply RendHamstring. If you like to spam keys and focus on single target youre better off with Fury or Enhancement playstyle.   ,worldofpvp,d5llgzv,3,t5_2wbvb

8600286,0,t3_4xllzd,Dont macro your defensives together. Arms already has limited survivability so its best to stagger them out with Commanding Shout being your absolute last ditch effort to stay alive. Die by the Sword is better to use for preventing burst so dont be afraid to use it at higher health if someone is popping cooldowns against you. Plus if you play any arenas youll want to have Commanding Shout on a separate bind to use for your team mates. I wouldnt macro your offensive cooldowns into Bladestorm because its more than just a damage dealer. You can treat it like a utility ability to avoid CC and get away from roots or snares if youre in danger. For instance its great for when a Mage drops a Ring of Frost.Youre safe to put Avatar and Battle Cry together though just make sure you pop Battle Cry when Colossus Smash is off cooldown and you can use its debuff window for maximum damage. Berserker Rage doesnt help your damage and should be held for breaking incaps and fears.A cancelaura macro is good for Bladestorm. I personally keep one in my Charge Pummel and Execute macros.As for any sort of rotation just keep everything on cooldown including Colossus Smash. Prioritize CS above all because it does crazy damage on its own and buffs your other abilities. Ideally youll want to Colossus Smash then follow it up with Overpower and  Mortal Strikes. If everything is on cooldown and you have over  rage then just Slam or Whirlwind depending on how many targets are around you. ,worldofpvp,d6gmnch,3,t5_2wbvb

8654354,0,t3_4yfr5t,I cant tell you what to play but Id tell you to go with your gut and pick one of the ones that a Forsaken can be. If you main the class youre going to spend more time on it during Legion than in previous expansions due to the artifact weapons. If you end up playing Druid you might end up ditching the class during the expansion if you dont like WorgenNelfsTaurenTrolls which would render your mileage on that character a waste. Id go with the monk but I vastly prefer Mistweaver healing to DiscHoly in arenas and I think WW is one of the most fun and fastest MDPS in the game. I dont PvE very often and when I do I dont tank. Everyone Ive talked to says Shadow is oodles of fun now so Id encourage you to play all of them at  and see how the gameplay works to see what you like. You can also read about the other races for Druids. Id suggest starting with Worgen because they are the biggest underdogs of the Druid community. However they are quite antiForsaken so I dont know if that would bother you. ,worldofpvp,d6neq3n,1,t5_2wbvb

You may need a review of your hardware.An mmo mouse might be your best bet. I know what youre thinking and I too was a little skeptical at first when thinking about going for it. The first few sessions were challenging thats for sure. But once you get the hang of it and start remembering your skills by muscle memory you can start to tweak what feels best and really be rolling better than ever. I read so many reviews about how people testify that they could never even think about going back to keyboard only and during my first couple plays I was a bit let down because I was making tons of mistakes and couldnt remember the binds struggled to get used to it but I didnt give up. It will take a few sessions at least to get the feel for it thats for sure. But once you do it really is like all the other testimonials Ive seen. I wouldnt play without this mouse. Its that damn good. I use the Logitech g. Im surprised there are so many fans of the Naga here. There is far superior quality materials and overall feel over the Naga. Either way everyone will like the different feel of each and choose respectively. Id say check out something like best buy and have a feel of the floor models they have lying about. Im mainly playing fire mage and have a bunch of the offensives on the front  buttons many defensivesutility on the back and leave the long CDs on the keys as a basic glance at setup. I hope this helps you out best of luck. Tldr I had doubts of going mmo mouse and now I could not see myself playing without one. Give it some consideration. ,worldofpvp,d6ow6h3,0,t5_2wbvb

Rogue has always been MECHANICALLY suited to v PvP situations so the current state of things versus the class balance of tomorrow is less of a concern. It may not be as difficult to play as monks but I maintain that it has a considerably higher skill ceiling than most classes. Hell resource management isnt even a concern for about half of them and rogues have two pertinent ones three if you count shadow dance. Its a mobile versatile and always needed class that favors splinter cell tactics over call of duty. Plus the fact that it isnt a caster is a pretty big bonus at the present. ,worldofpvp,d7hrgo3,3,t5_2wbvb

8994106,0,t3_53ai9m,Ok I know youre not complaining about DH and just looking for answers but please read the spell description before posting... gt prob metamorph gives parrydodge right? No. The only thing it brings is Haste and Leech . It also improve  abilities.gt  We usually go hard on Demon hunter I usually grip him and follow that up with poison gt chain of ice to slow him for my monk. You dont need to grab him Hell come. No need to waste it.  gt We usually try to burst him down since when he pops metamorph it seems like he can just delete a target.Beware of the  defensive cooldown the DH has. You have to track it and reset  switch target when it pops IE grab the mate and delete it. This is true for any class though its not specific to DH. Track enemy defensive CD and dont burst into it. I would suggest to read all the classes spells description to know what youre looking for or ask people in game.gt  When he pops meta i usually pop my Anti magic shield to try and stop the damage but no matter what i do i seem to get destroyed. And if when were against stealth i usually go for a trinket gt stun on usually feral feral but when he trinkets that he just smashes my head in..If hes not using the defensive cooldown you can tunnel the DH even in meta. You can also use your defensive cooldown if you fear to get bursted down. Without defensive cooldown up the DH will die during the asphyxiate or we its called. gt Also trying not to be too close to eachother because of the slice spell of DHThe artefact is a zone damage which means if you dont stay near the blades you wont get damaged. gt   I especially struggle since i find UH pretty hard since im not used to it at all but the spec overall seems pretty complex to me so UH DK tips in Arena would also be great!Cant help on this I didnt play enough UH during legion sorrygt Do you guys have any general tips on battling DH comps andor with our comp? I will gear up art weaponfor frost and maybe it gets better i dont know.Dont let the DH free force him to pop his defensive CDs and blow him up. If he use Canon barage kicking it will prevent him to use any abilities for few second.Dont be afraid of the meta. He deals more but it doesnt make him godmode. Remember the leech is  only in pvp and your necro strike prolly would solve this problem Im not sure if its used as UH s though but on paper it seems a good answer.,worldofpvp,d7syadh,3,t5_2wbvb
9006815,0,t1_d7tkq70,Yep you are right about that. But if your hunter wants to try something spastic he should yolo MM. Some Thugs go with MM right now and its a fun change. Bm is still better IMO but MM brings up to  CCs and rogue can focus more on the training.,worldofpvp,d7uh83s,1,t5_2wbvb

9120542,0,t3_557bc6,The comp isnt ideal because Polymorphs DRs with Hex which puts you down a CC. However I can see some nice Cap Totem into Poly potential if you can manage to line it up. Frost Mage is highly dependent on casting so getting trained by melee is going to be a problem and same with getting LoSed.Honestly my only advice is to max out honor and see if you do any better. If that doesnt work you should get a Disc priest for more damage or play RogueMage.,worldofpvp,d8852j2,2,t5_2wbvb

9128176,0,t3_55a46n,I was the Disc on the highest rated DiscRog s team in my Battlegroup during Cata. Granted there have been a lot of changes since then  but the strats are probably similarish.What comps do you need help with other than the two you listed? Hunter healer is going to be an uphill battle assuming Hunters still have a bunch of snares. You need to keep full dmg on the healer and spend every spare global cleaning the opposing healer with dispel. Eventually you can get through defensive and kill. If the hunter blows defensives unnecessarily you can always do a hard swap to him with full kidney and vendettafiend. Granted you need both of their trinkets gone before this works  but itd be much easier now rather than having to use something like the Cata Redirect Rog ability. Not sure how viable it is to kill the hunters pet  I dont think we ever used to.Against mage rogue you have to survive the opener. Your rogue needs to stay stealthed and open rogue when he opens on you. If your rogue gets sapped youre on your way to a loss without seriously out playing them. Dont waste damage from your Rogue on the opener just to have the other Rogue Vanish it off or have the Mage block. Good teams will wait until youre stunned before they block to prevent MD or theyll prekick it. Blind Mage early ride the rogue and make sure to mash dispel on your rogue to keep him free from Sheep. Then switch to whichever of your targets doesnt have trinket and a defensive and try to finish with Vendetta and burst from you.  Recognize their burst and PS early  you actually are favorited to win if your rogue can keep the mage kicked on Frost during burst while peeling  and controlling rogue. This match is more about how good your rogue is than you  you stay alive dispel when you can and then Fear on a switch. Dont waste fear on rogue if your partner is just going to break it instantly. The biggest thing I would recommend is to really start communicating Fear and Kidney timers. It should be like clockwork. You fear someone as he kidneys the other no exceptions  that needs to happen against every comp because it almost always forces a trinket and if they dont have trinket left  it creates crazy momentum. Make it a habit to ask your Rogue how long on Kidneys CD every s or so and then tell him how long until fear. Let him pool energy and then go. I probably still have videos on YouTube under Narthypoo but its almost entirely Cata content. MoP was so bad it made me drop Disc after playing it across  different priests on  different accounts for years.Good luck!,worldofpvp,d8928sl,1,t5_2wbvb

9167654,0,t1_d8duo33,I mean technically its a great talent but from my experience it breaks important polymorphs or ring of frosts and you just lose kill opportunity.Also I suggest you watch Xaryus vids where he explains talentsartifact for frost mage. But in that vid its  weeks old he says that comet storm is good and glacial spike is bad. However now he uses glacial spike  of the time because it always provides decent damage and you are casting a lot of frostbolts with honor talents anyway and you dont really have a good way to dump them since you lose fingers of frost procs from everything because of deep shatter honor talent apart from artifact ability.edit he also stopped using prismatic cloak and plays with burning determination most of the time since you cast a lot and its almost impossible to do when ur trained by x melee without burning determination ,worldofpvp,d8e2fjj,1,t5_2wbvb

Destro in mop could do a lot more relative to the HP pools and you could cleave them as well which is what destro gives up to essentially have a reason to cast chaos bolt. Youre just spewing numbers that other specs do without considering the specs kit. Destro literally only does damage with chaos bolt. Immolate and conflag only serve as shard regen. Artifact ability is not only random but has a  second CD for each charge. Incinerate isnt worth casting. If chaos bolt does k damage then destro can actually kill things. ,worldofpvp,d99qwbb,-1,t5_2wbvb

I think I might be sort of in denial honestly but Ive been playing the same way as before the nerfs just with markedly less success. I tried a few games with the PvE talent that causes UA to increase damage your DoTs deal but thats more of a singletarget thing and I didnt have enough Soul Shards to keep good uptime on all of the targets in s.

9475650,0,t3_5aj91m,Saying some shit like its not easy to balance  equations and status effects is just misleading.  It is easy.  For one thing at least in todays game its the end result that matters.  Class design is very poor for a lot of classes in PvP so theres no point intricately balancing every individual aspect of a class and theyre CLEARLY not trying to do that at all.  Theyre interested in the end result hence the sledgehammer approach of just nerfing and buffing main stats in the templates.  They dont care that it was Bag of Tricks and Vendetta that made ass rogues insane they just nerfed their stats and called it a day.  And really theres nothing wrong with that approach.  It might not be the most ideal solution but for the purposes of balance itll get the job done eventually as long as they keep patching.On top of that the interplay between the  equations is what should get worked out during development alpha and beta at the latest.  Were always playing a crappy beta product when an expansion gets released but even at that its WAY further along than having to worry about that much shit.  By the time players are logging in all of that work has long been done and all thats left is to see which things end up being too strong or too weak and nerfing and buffing them accordingly.  In Blizzards defense theyve been doing that pretty damn well so far in Legion.  I dont like the current state of the game at all but no one can argue that they arent trying probably harder than they ever have before.  Were getting balance patches like every couple of weeks and most of the changes are at least targeted at the right stuff.  But regardless they are long past any phase of development that involves thinking about  equations.,worldofpvp,d9h2trg,-3,t5_2wbvb

9629153,0,t3_5cwany,RMD is a comp where everyone needs to understand their role. You will win or lose based on opener. U win based on hard swaps with disgusting cc chains.

9653291,0,t1_da1lyh5,I agree with this. Since . Ive switched to survival hunter and Ive been having to learn how to play like a rogue with being melee and having access to stealth. Picking your fights is key. If its going to be v or even a v at a random spot in a BG you should just ignore them unless they are holding a strategic point. Go find other targets download some addons that let you keep track of the enemy healers or flag carriers and go for them because you can usually count on teammates helping you kill those targets. If there are no healers or such in sight target an enemy who is already under pressure and a rogue will almost always be able to push that into a kill. Also dont forget to do WQs. Getting to at least  ilvl is rather easy between random BG queues world boss drops and WQ gear. You wont have the Stat advantage against most players if you have  ilvl but most players at least wont be gt away from you in stats. ,worldofpvp,da2yvro,2,t5_2wbvb

9797872,0,t1_dakscfw,Thanks again a short and probably last question.Does the assassination rogue excel at anything at all or are sub and outlaw better in everything?,worldofpvp,dakssdx,1,t5_2wbvb
9806253,0,t1_dakxumc,Now Im no great player or anything so take what I say with a grain of salt but the general idea is around getting good set ups. Depending on what you play you can force put CDs and targetburst accordingly. Lets take the comp my friends and I play for example RetEnhanceMW. Once we connect with a DPS and can put out some damage IllRet stun their healer. Theyre generally at  health when we do this so the healer a lot of times can sit it. After thats down our monk will paralyze and get on range for a leg sweep. By now were putting out good damage and some sort of defensive is going to have to be used to survive it. Lets say they have a Holy Pally. He trinkets it and Sacs. Ok we start on the other DPS. About  seconds later I HoJ again. This time his trinket is down. We start getting good damage off in the  seconds. Another Paralyze comes out into another leg sweep. Enhance has hexed the other DPS so he cant peel along with wind shearing and rebuking incoming cc on us such as polyfearhex. Were getting good damage off now and Pally is forced to bubble to break the CC chain. Well now since we used good set ups to get CDs instead of bursting the Pally has nothing left to survive so we hard swap him and in about  seconds when HoJ is back up and his trinket is still down we ascendancewingslust and it almost always nets a kill. Now thats how an ideal game would go. In a less than ideal game theyll be trying to same thing and they get their stuff off better. A Mage gets polys off or a lock gets their fears off so they peel us too much for us to be able to force out those CDs. Those ones go poorly. Thats the thing we havent figured out yet is how to stop that from happening and is why we quit moving up the ladder. Ideally though thats how it would work. Get some set ups going and make them use CDs to survive your CC chains instead of your burst then your burst will get you a kill.Like I said Im no pro or anything at PvP but no one else has replied so I figured Id toss in my two cents. This is my general understanding of it however execution is easier said than done and I still havent properly learned to execute either. ,worldofpvp,daltxkf,1,t5_2wbvb

10042501,0,t1_dbfddkr,As for the lvl  talents    Arcane Orb now dealing  of spell power so not only it is an excellent arcane charge builder it should now deal a good chunk of damage  approx. a little more damage than a  charge AB. Quiiiiite good.  It allows a more agressive playstyle constantly building and spending charges without the need to AB  AE  times between each ABarr. You spend more time at  charges without the need to build them by CC breaking aoe  loooooong casts that will be kicked anyway. Overpowered more than doubles the effects of the baseline AP so  damage during our burst. Temporal Flux gives at max.  haste on AB only.   Now for the comparison   Temporal Flux tooltip already tells us how this talent is worthless in PvP   max haste on AB where its easy to kick our only magic school during a burst... where were not supposed to cast is garbage. I only see this talent used in open world for WQ  farming on a PvE server. Maybe it could be ok in PvE with the T gear and a full haste gear... Ill let the theorycrafters enlight us about that.  AO vs OP... tough choice will depend on the playstyle the context and the comp honestly.  Lets preface this by stating that a normal burst sequence  MoA  regular AP  PoM AB at AC   filler  hardcasted AB  SN  ABarr  PTR AO no external modifiers like RoP or rogues ToTT  shamans angry red totem  will chunk a bit more than half of the targets max hp with  crits. With this in mind    OP can be brutal with another huge damage spikes caster. Typically the goto talent while in a caster cleave elem destru maybe balance and fmage where you need to boost your burst damage to make sure your target dies even if it uses a soft def. CD during the short window you both will be allowed to CC and cast. Straightforward talent  you boost your burst window at the expense of your sustained damage  unless you pick Charged Up and agree loosing SN  Resonance .  Remember that AP is stealable  dispellable. AO provides a nice instant AB with AC potentially cleaving to complement your burst and gives you at least  AC. It allows a more sustained damage than OP by allowing you to ABarr more thus saving mana that can be used to sustain the Mana Shield.  Remember my preface ? The standard arcane mage burst rotation without any lvl  talent is already decent without the need of a single cast so not kickable. Basically your target is certain to take full damage if youre not hard CCd. But youre not supposed to burst with no DR on your face.  Anyway since you ask my opinion if I dont need the damage spike AO is the goto talent for me I just love versatility.  TLDR   crucial need of a damage boost ? OP. For every other case AO.But things get a bit more complicated if we take into account the  and  tiers...      Mirror Image is still worthless. Due to its min CD it should be a GREAT off. CD  as in enemy should switch to them and kill them before getting overwhelmed by the magnificient damage it should provide . But thats not the case. You dont need them for bursting anyway and if ever youre freecasting you can go high risk highreward with RoP.  Only niche use is vs double  triple DPS teams in v and v respectively. Incanters Flow the default option averaging an overall  increase of damage. Straightforward damage helper not much to say.   Rune of Power the highrisk highreward option. If you have very short perfect burst windows where all stars are aligned the kind that happen only in a caster cleave it could be a very attractive option. If the damage outside the burst windows doesnt matter at all and if youre confident in your  your mates and you  ability to CC the whole team before trying to burst opening you said windows it could be a reliable talent.  Quite the same argument as OP vs AO here  intense burst spikes or versatility and smoothed out damage ?  Supernova Shit damage but usable in movement if you dont want to ABarr and more importantly an instant knock up  so DRs with nothing its quite a unique CC category on its own along hunters old bumptrap shamans orage etc...  delaying enemy spells.  Serves as an instant range interrupt and can be gamechanging. Charged Up Instantly gain AC each s. Perfect in very short games  double triple DPS if and only if SN isnt a better alternative for its CC  or if using OP instead of AO as the lvl  talent for okayish AC generation. I currently dont use it but that could change in .. in the context of me playing a wizard cleave.  Slightly reduces the interest of AO for generating AC in a min long arena fight. Slightly.  Straightforward talent besides that. One could use it with AO for sustained  and poor  cleave damage but without Resonance on the same tier its just not worth it.   Resonance My current goto talent outside of arenas. Increases by  the ABarr damage on single target if theres no other targets in range for cleaving thus increasing both single target and cleave damage. It could potentially deal  of spell power on a single target and half that amount to targets nearby   the golden artifact trait damage to everyone .  Huge for big dick cleave damage in RBGs default choice if SN has no use and you can reliably hit  targets  pets do count ! Get fucked uDKs  BMs  enhs !  with ABarr in arena.Your preference here. Its the tier that well switch around the most depending of the allied and enemy comps I guess. Theres no bad choice only slightly better ones depending on the situation.EDIT  Temporal Anomaly is back to a  chance each sec instead of  chance. If you cant live without RNG and cant play with a slowapplying class nor want to spend GCDs applying Slow yourself it can be picked.

10130140,0,t1_dbqcric,gt Know how to cast  fake casting is far from bieng the best solution. I thought it was for a long time but with the talent reducing the amount of silence after a kicksilence its probably better to cast directly on you and get interrupted. If you want you can probably fake cast later on when the guy thinks that he will interrupt you for sure. But fake casting three spells is already a loss of healing time.I agree with your other points but not with this one. If you properly fakecast you dont waste a lot of globals read dont cast interrupt and wait for them to do something but fake a cast and then follow up with an instant and you get to take the talent for double healing surge making up for the lost time. I rarely see any rshams having the silence talent in s.,worldofpvp,dbryo11,1,t5_2wbvb

10749010,0,t3_5ts4l0,I dont know how the match up should work exactly because these two comps have such a high skill ceiling in terms of what they can do. However a few pointers Priest can mass dispel cyclone may be costly in mana but I feel like Druid will always win the dampening when vs priest. Have you tried Druid as a target? Sheep on Mage fear on rogue or something with a full stun on resto Druid if you can catch out of bear form? I think you have to play a lot more aggressive against rmd since they have better resets dampening and cc. When you play with a priest you play a more aggressive version of the comp. Sorry I cant be more of help ,worldofpvp,ddoofa7,3,t5_2wbvb
10750872,0,t1_ddok6tf,Do you think druid rogue is as viable as priest rogue in s? The dr with blind and clone is what makes me feel hunter has the edge in s and probably always will.That being said i agree that hunter is more likely to have an off season in s although I guess rmd wasnt that great last patch so our best option probably wouldve been to run with rogue dk if playing rogue. Still a tough choice because my brother likes both hunter and rogue so we cant just choose which one is more fun it comes down to which one is more future proof.,worldofpvp,ddovbyb,1,t5_2wbvb

11179104,0,t3_5zlxee,Just keep playing. Join any group that will take you or just create your own. There are plenty of groups of people just trying to spam  wins for the mount so those should be easy to jump into. Try to avoid all DPS groups in both s and s. Playing without a healer in arena will teach you nothing as a new player. You need time to react to things and the cushion of heals to save you when you fuck up and you will fuck up a lot. Fortunately for you your fuck ups will be less noticeable in Legion.Ignore the shit talking. Its not exclusive to WoW. Youll find it in any PvP game you play from shooters to MOBAs to MMOs.Lastly just watch Twitch streams of high rated PvPers when youre bored and have downtime. Try to find one that takes the time to answer chat and gives out commentary. I dont know what class you play so I cant recommend one but Smexxin is probably one of the most helpful streamers NA as far as answering questions and providing insight on how he plays the game. ,worldofpvp,dez50do,6,t5_2wbvb

11273630,0,t1_df9gqt9,At times it was a spam class and mostly you could get away with it. Especially during wod with spamming Whirlwind while MS was on cd. But to really get some or somewhere you have to think. Ive always felt that playing at a higher level is like playing chess. You just gotta think ahead have a solution to every situation. I sort of feel that now I dont as a warrior have a solution for every situation but it always required thinking ahead. All classes do.Well Ive grown accustom to my class but at times it is difficult to fight multiple mobs. Sometimes I feel as if we dont have enough damage sometimes its survivability that lacks but mostly in outdoors situations its easy with Victory Rush. As long as you down one mob you can survive.Ofcourse I do miss having the ability to heal in pvp content but at times that was ridiculous too. During wod or mop the second wind thing was just plain op. But having enraged regeneration during most of my pvp experience was pleasing.,worldofpvp,df9ule7,2,t5_2wbvb
