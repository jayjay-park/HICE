11500337,0,t3_63s7ks,Death penalty should exist as a deterrent for crimes where a deterrent like the death penalty would deter from someone committing the crime.Did Person A knowingly plan to kill Persons B C and D? If yes give the death penalty. Two men get in a heated debate about which football team is better. Afterwards they get into a fight and one of them dies. Should they get the death penalty? No because I doubt they would have planned on killing each other. A death penalty wouldnt have deterred this. A limited sentence of something like  years makes more sense.On the other hand if you instead make everything punishable by the death penalty then there might be situations where it would be beneficial for a criminal to kill a person because they might have a better chance of getting away with a crime. So hopefully Ive explained that while there are caveats to having a capital punishment system there are reasons why they can work if implemented properly but if theyre implemented incorrectly they have the potential to cause social disorder. So yeah the death penalty is a tricky thing. I reckon its true effectiveness depends on what a criminal truly values while theyre committing a crime. Obviously either killing a person or financial gain but we have to think what possible punishment would keep a criminal from committing a crime thats both easily affordable easily implemented and tuned exactly to what would have deterred the criminal most effectively. We also have to be careful that the deterrent isnt cruel or unusual. There are a myriad of possible answers for a good deterrent which is why we generally assume all people want to live and we punish that with either a life sentence with no parole or a death penalty. But still these are not a deterrent for all criminals. What about suicide bombers? What deters them from killing multiples of people if they have no will to live anyway? What motivates these people? Arguably here its a matter of not allowing them to be a martyr and not plastering their face all over billboards everywhere when they commit a crime. Ultimately the death penalty only exists because we dont know a better deterrent for planned crime and we arent willing to go past being cruel and unusual to find a better deterrent thats less deadly. Edit I was gonna write some other shit but I got bored with the topic. ,XNTP,dfzka3s,1,t5_3jw40
