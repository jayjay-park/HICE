3483284,0,t1_cpp92d1,Thanks so much this makes me have another question. Is the Ballast Point tasting room that is close to those other places the same as the brewery? In other words what are the differences between the two Ballast Point locations?,sandiegobeer,cppbimm,1,t5_2w0x7
7548597,0,t1_d307tdq,Yeah this is probably a good bang for your buck option. Uber to either Fall Brewing in the north of Hamiltons brewing in the south and you can walkor take super short Ubers up th for like  miles and hit like  different great beer bars and around  different breweries and tap rooms. ,sandiegobeer,d308mbk,3,t5_2w0x7
10055971,0,t3_5jpve2,Years ago.  For a few years after it opened.  Went to a lot of shows there.  It was cool back then really great beer selection for the time.  Went back maybe once after Rob sold or gave up? the place they had switched to serving beers in  oz plastic cups which was a deal killer for me.  Not sure how long that was a thing but theyd always poured  ounces into proper glassware before.  Mostly a grad student pub weeknights.,sandiegobeer,dbibfqp,2,t5_2w0x7
