9281609,0,t3_56mpaq,Ill just reiterate what I said in the other vanilla threadIve been floating this idea around for awhile but Id really like to see us do another spawn cave a throwback to WofS S. If you dont know anything about that look here As far as terrain gen goes this would mean it would be really nice to have spawn above a large ravine or mineshaft preferably both. Of course I know not everyone will be done with this so I was also thinking that there would be an above ground section as well.Feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions or questions regarding this idea.EDIT Heres a pic of the WofS spawn cave with atmospheric lighting just for anyone wondering what it was like. ,CompactCraft,d8siem5,1,t5_390wy
