4753224,1,t1_cttikl1,Yes that feature is present in the XBO.  The major differences are in their online Xbox is still light years ahead of Sony But in the last year Sony has learned and has been stripping features that made XBLIVE popular in adding it into PSN.   Group chat in PSN is still buggy but workable they have added free games in like the XBOX does but the SONY product keeps the up longer and tends to repeat titles every few months but since launch of XBO their hasnt been a repeated title on XBO.The real reason to choose a console is which exclusives you want or what your friends own.  The PS has a slight lead in overall sales but xbox has a better developer support if you went to E this year rd parties are doing more with Xbox then PS in their exclusives but that said very few rd party exclusives.

6258239,0,t3_3zkktz,So I live in Maryland and my wife and I were shopping at a Toys R Us in the area on Tuesday.  They put out the Ghostbusters level pack early and I was able to snag it.  Took it to the counter didnt scan.  She said the system says I am not suppose to sell it.  Told the girl you arent going to make me wait a week are you?  She got a manager to override it.  I was floored that they even did that.  So I have the set I can play as the character and use the car but I own the Wii U version of the game and they havent updated it yet to allow me to access that world.  Kinda irked since Ive seen that the Xbox and PS versions are updated.On that note though the Ecto has lights and a siren in game but the siren gets cut off a bit kind of dumb but at least it has the siren.  The other lego characters all get trapped in a containment field  like slimer did in the first movie and float when they get hit with the proton stream.  Venkman comes into the game and says Thats right boys!  Its Dr. Venkman! and does other lines during the game like Youre always so worried about your reputation. and You dont generally see that type of behavior from a kitchen appliance.   pictures of the set.I look forward to actually playing the Ghostbusters level.,Legodimensions,cz0zrjg,2,t5_37rc6

Theyre meant for the polybaggged minifigures I think but they work just as well. Most characters can fit in still on the toy tag although some you have to remove it and tuck the tag behind them.The smallest Artbin containers are too small for figures  they fit but you have to remove accessorieshats.

It looks great so far  really looking forward to the additions.Thought I would let you know I did notice one minor thing after entering my stuff and playing around with it a bit. I have it entered that I have both the Scooby Doo pack and the Jurassic pack. On the available abilities section it does check off the abilities these packs give me. But when I was playing around with the abilities tracker it wasnt showing the correct abilities checked off for the characters I have. Like when I go to Digging under the abilities tracker it has a couple of my digging things checked off Shelob Emmets excavator but not Scooby or Velociraptor. Same thing if I go to Vine Cutting it doesnt have Owen or Velociraptor checked off. Playing around with it a bit it seems like the abilities tracker section not recognizing these. Hopefully that made sense let me know if it didnt. Really not a big deal but thought Id say something just in case its affecting other parts of the tracker or something. Thanks again for this!

7643374,0,t3_4jwlg9,After reading this carefully heres my  centsHP is almost a guarantee franchise especially due to recent rumors about  characters being in the files.Also I think Teen Titans Go is likely for the something warner bros due to it being popular.I think Minecraft is another guaranteed franchise despite it being owned by Microsoft. The reason for this is simply because of it being viewed more as a platform than a game. Big Bang Theory is a tough one it has adult humor but has a Lego set? Then again it was a Lego idea set just like Dr. Who so theres a chance.A Team? I dont really think it will join. It just seems too adult for Lego especially due to dealing with content around the Vietnam War. Unlike Simpsons this content cant really be hidden due to it being the backstory of the main characters.As for some of your would probably fit but havent been considered franchises...My Little Pony is a big no seeing as it is owned by Hasbro. There was a Lego CUUSOO back in  that was dismissed for this exact reason. The same applies for transformers dreamwork properties and various other properties all not necessarily Hasbro mind you.Finally just because something is adult doesnt mean it cant have cameos. Look at TF for instance. While it definitely will not join any time soon there is a small cameo of a level  sentry in the game For those who dont know about it look closely at the Sentry Turret Upgrade path.So in conclusion this is only a fraction of my thoughts. I have more but I dont want to clog up this comment.,Legodimensions,d3b0dmo,1,t5_37rc6

Slowing time will slow the fan speeding time will quicken it due to time passing at different rates for you compared to the fan. The fan isnt important the act of the fan slowing downspeeding up is important. It was merely an example.Change the fan to something else a set magical spinning swords. They spin very fast and in the style of LEGO you cant alter them without a Keystone. To get past their very quick rotation you must slow time down for the spinning swords.

We hate this especially because this particular rumor is so stupid and everything about what youve said is very clearly rubbing salt in an open wound. We know nothing about your sources we cant confirm this information and the deeper you go into saying this bullshit he less of it we want to hear. ,Legodimensions,de7m0u2,13,t5_37rc6

10998903,0,t1_ded70p8,Maybe the Hocrux is too much for him at the moment and he needs The Deluminator  to hear all us fans calling for him so a little light will shine in to his heart and he will come back to us. Keep telling that to Hermione and she may just allow him to be her other half ,Legodimensions,deeoxqu,1,t5_37rc6

11119789,0,t3_5y8dh9,I would say use Harry or Voldemort for it I was trying it with Newt but it seems to not work with him.Alternatively though its entirely possible your extrasnamely way of the brick and wizardly whiz could be interfering with it. If your still having trouble try exiting disabling your extras attempting then reenabling them.Also if you got the TARDIS you can pack  characters into it Hug the Raven room window enter the interior room of the TARDIS then have everyone jump out. Usually someone will incorrectly spawn into the room and you can nab that gold brick early,Legodimensions,desf3t6,1,t5_37rc6
11122248,0,t1_desc8gs,Most people here in America have heard about Plastic Man or have seen his image regardless of if they read comics. Same cant be said for farting aliens or one character being replaced by a plastic duplicate. Plastic Man is more iconic and would likely sell better. Plus hed have more uses in the game.
