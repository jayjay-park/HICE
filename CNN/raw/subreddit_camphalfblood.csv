1891527,0,t1_ckh2zw3,A blonde leader a darker girl with darker hair and a white brown haired boyNot Leo isnt even a NotLeo. Leo isnt white is he? Hes hispanic. And considering brown hair is pretty a common trait...The others are pretty common to honestly. Lets assume the author had three main characters two boys and one girl with one of the boys being the leader. Okay good. Now lets try to make the two boys easier to distinguishdraw differently one will have blonde hair and the other will have darker hair. Usually darker people dont have blonde hair so the blonde boy will be white. But I do need at least darker skinned person so it leaves the boy and the girl. Hell lets make the girl the darker skinned person. That works.If the author was going to have a darkskinned person it would have most likely had to be either the NotLeo or the NotPiper since theres few darkerskinned people with blonde hair. If she made the not Leo a darker skinned person but Piper white he would actually be a NotLeo but then NotPiper would become an actual not Piper. ,camphalfblood,ckh4cbu,-1,t5_2sxzy

Also Percy and Annabeth at this point can safely appear in another series without really spoiling the events from their own world. ToA isnt about Percy and Annabeth its about Apollo all the way. So if you ask me theyre probably going to appear as side characters in both series but wont actually be the stars of the show.
