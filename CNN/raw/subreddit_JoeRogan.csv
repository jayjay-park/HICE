So not only that but he is trying to keep a conversation not based on shared experiences unlike your own friends who you can tell to shut the fuck up out of love with a big smile on your face.Come on lets be realistic.

He talks about a lack of motivation to work for those who are impoverished etc.Youre arguing that he has struggled in his life.  Im sure he has.

357255,0,t1_cfhs61b,If we are operating on the assumption that being overweight or obese is due to addiction then overweight or obese people should be treated as addicts. Which means you stop enabling and provide assistance if its asked for just like you would with any other addict. I dont think we are arguing about that.What Im getting at is the point when we are asked to go beyond acceptance and compassion etc  all of the things a normal person would feel when confronted with a person who is suffering  when we are asked to go beyond that and accept that being overweight is a healthy choice. From the things youre saying Im going to live dangerously for a moment here and assume that youve been lucky enough to not have encountered this type of behavior before. Its really quite obnoxious... theres people out there who will do anything to try to convince themselves and others that being overweight or obese is a perfectly normal state of affairs much the same way as any other addict tries to live in denial as long as possible to avoid the consequences of recognizing reality for what it is. So you end up with shit like thin privilege and other feats of twisted reasoning all intended to make an addict feel better about his or her poor choices.

Undoubtedly philosophy arises from moral positions but to debase commentary as subjective in favor other another subjective point of view seems absurd. I believe I know what youre getting at though The NonAggression Principle? Right. Well sorry to say but NAP is not objective nor can it account for all situations. Its a cute Occams Razor of general morality for the layperson but nothing more.My view on economics and governance arises from studying both of these fields and reading their historical origins as well as examining casestudies between countries accounting for differences in governance policy and econometrics.

How about you give me all the facts surrounding the situation and let me decide who is in the wrong.  You know...like...reporting the news.The closest thing to a fact is the head line.  Cop enters without warrant.  Ok...but there is such a thing as probable cause.  Why did the officer say he entered without a warrant?  Did he see someone in danger inside a home did he see illegal activity from a public area? Also Im tired of hearing the words shot an unarmed...  As if there is no circumstance that leathal force is necessary on an unarmed person.  People on Rogans reddit page should be well aware that hands are leathal for anyone that knows how to use them.  Hold the choke a bit longer that could be the last time he sees his family.  And if you get knocked out youre at the mercy of your attacker.Also can we make a different name for a teen thats a minor and a teen over the age of majority?  There is a big difference in a  year old and a  year old.  I have no idea how old this particular person was but thats because of the vague language used in the article.  When I hear teen porn I think of a  chick.  You say innocent unarmed teen is shot I think a  year old kid was shot.  Everyone knows that so do the people who write articles like these.Do the fallen the service of of presenting the facts and letting the people decide how they feel about i it.  I used to have a strong disdain towards police.  I think articles like these are starting to sway me away from those feelings.

3503277,0,t1_cprkkjj,. I dont know? How do you know how many times hes been hunting?  Every time I listen to the podcast he seems to be talking about another of his latest hunting trips. I cant keep up.. From what I see he does go with other more experienced hunters.  As a hunter myself I always enjoy going with other hunters and you really only learn when you are with someone who knows more than you.  Is he paying them? When he is doing an episode of MeatEater with Steven Rinella he isnt paying for that.  Has he paid other hunters to go with him? Who knows. Who cares? What difference does it make?.  No.  You dont set up feeders on the hunting trips hes been on.  Hes going out into the fucking wilds of Montana and shit. You dont set up feeders out there.  You set up a feeder weeks or months before you actually intend to go hunting near it.  Youre training the animals to learn that this is where the food is.  Keep coming here for more food.  And then you have to check on it every couple of weeks.  Keep it full of food. Replace dying batteries etc.  Usually a feeder is used much closer to your home so it isnt so much trouble to go check on every couple of weeks.  You dont set up a feeder hide in the bushes at point blank range and expect animals to flock to you.I appreciate the point youre trying to make.  Hes still very new to hunting and here he is looking like a bad ass on the cover of this hunting magazine as if he were some tried and true salt of the earth hunter that has been at it for years.  I can see where youre coming from.  But your comment also speaks of ignorance and a slight hint of negativity.. so he can blast the animal from point blank u mad bro?

3603136,0,t3_31m45v,TLDR Video of the fight no longer exists on the Internet and Beef  Squashed.I believe the fight was on an Ice House Chronicles around the time Joe was recording Live at the Tabernacle.  This was also around the time where Duncan was on a rampage against SXSW because they were sponsored by an airline company yet they expected all performers to pay for all expenses including plane travel to Texas and only receive a pass to the festival and publicity from their performance as compensation. Around the same time Redban was hosting a regular comedy show and similarly not paying the performers. However that was due to his overhead costs rather than making a profit. Redban later changed his policy on paying performers but held quite a childish grudge against Duncan for months on end. Duncan apologized on his podcast almost right away but it took Redban a few months and an emotional ecstasy trip to come to the conclusion that he was wrong too. Redban then had Duncan back on the Ice House Chronicles where they announced that the fued was over. To Redbans credit though he either took the video of the fight down right after it went up or never put it up in the first place. Edit Formatting. ,JoeRogan,cq2zen0,28,t5_2s4tv

4243887,0,t1_cs3zeea,Well we would have a multitude of difficulties to deal with. There would most likely be many different habitats some on Earth and some not. How many people would relinquish their human form and become an alternate organism if possible? So a portion of the population could fragment due to new possibilities in life styles. I think most people would stay in the Earth like habitats and human forms but more adventuresome people would find alternatives. I doubt it would have to be permanently fragmented unless thats what someone wants. We would have to create our own challenges and probably want to because an eternal existence of pure joy and reward would stop being novel. Keeping existence novel would be the biggest difficulty of all for if our imagination fueled our environments it would eventually start creating redundancies without outside stimuli to feed it. So I suppose an immortal existence will always start to become repetitious after vast amounts of time passing unless you are in a self altering environment such as a habitual planet.

But really YMH is the most consistent podcast Im a fan of  every episode is fantastic to me.

I listened to all the Dr. Rhonda ones and just assumed that other scientists he has on are as legitimate as she appears to be. Although in saying that I did try to watch one the other day with  Dr. Amit boswami and I had to turn it off after  mins when he started bringing up spirituality in India and all brains being connected by a subconscious. He was spouting all these wild theories based on dubious sounding experiments. I downloaded the episode because it said he was a retired theoretical physicist. The guy was clearly a quack Joe was eating it all up too for the most part which is why I had to stop listening.

Pretty much confirms what I thought about CIAs shadiness around the aftermath. Ive gone deep into the JFK rabbit hole and came out thinking that a lot of the seeming coverup activity was a bunch of ass covering for fuck ups and keeping other illegal programs secret.

These mongs see it as devaluing their cause when white people show support or take leadership positions in their racial brigades because it conveys that there are whitesnonblacks who are not racist and who are standing with them which makes them look less deserving of sympathy. They see it as weakening their message but its a catch because it also might indicate that their message isnt necessary to begin with because of the overwhelming support are there racist people? Yes. Are there so many racist people that daytoday life is a problem? I doubt it. Personally I just think most of these sorts of activist groups do a lot of this shit just for the attention and to feel like their life has purpose while they go on their pointless crusades. Life in general is pretty mundane for most people its not like  years ago where everyday was a struggle for the average person. Nowadays most get by spending most of their day at work watching Netflix at the gym eating or enjoying hobbies and so these activist groups feel like theyre on some kind of righteous purposeful mission that breaks up the monotony and they dont want it to end.,JoeRogan,cwz7uxm,16,t5_2s4tv

6277241,0,t1_cz2jf4v,gt Im pretty sure bill gates didnt steal a penny of his wealth he got by selling people computers. Why is it wrong for him to have billions of dollars if he earned it by people voluntarily buying his goods?Ok so your argument is that Bill Gates should be able to keep what hes earned. Ok Im in agreement. However theres plenty of people who work as hard if not harder than Bill Gates and dont have Bill Gates money to show for it. Why? Well theres a lot of factors but Id suggest the biggest one is luck.Bill Gates released the right product at the right time to the right people for the right price. Theres plenty of other operating systems that came before but Bill also largely stole from them as uhoneypie points out.What about say Katy Perry. Is she talented? Yes. Is she hard working? Undoubtedly. However did she get where she is because she was talented and worked hard? In part yes but also because she got really lucky. Just take a look at her bio Further it also includes who you know not what you know as is partly the case for Katy Perry as well.So I agree with you that someone should keep what they earn however did Bill Gates really work . billion dollars hard? Or did he work really hard and then a lot of good shit along with doing some shady shit propel him to the exceptional example that we all know that he is?But heres the thing even higher taxes arent entirely the answer. Its not income tax thats really the problem either.gtThe top  of individuals had six figure incomes exceeding  the top  of individuals had incomes exceeding So what this means is that the top  of the population earn just over year which isnt really all that much. Further than this often includes doubleincome households. However accordingly this link Making year puts you at the top . Still not very high.So where is all the money? Its invested. The ultrarich arent EARNING their money theyre collecting it from dividends. Theyre getting paid for having partial ownership in a company. The issue here is that theyre not collecting an income and the tax rate is different for this sort of investment.However theres also associated risks but high gains. So if we really wanted to address wealth disparity in the country wed have to find a way of properly taxing income that is made from investments while also not discouraging people from making investments which includes investing in riskier startups and companies. Consider that if we were to increase the tax rate wed end up with fewer new and innovative business as theyd be inherently riskier. To give an analogy wed end up with the equivalent of everyone only investing in new Call of Duty games and no one investing intelligently investing in indie games.So really either way were totally fucked.The biggest issue though is that companies are entirely based around the idea of maximizing profit at the expense of the employee. If we really want to address wealth disparity or at least give people a better more livable wage what we need to do is start regulating businesses more such that it is in their best interest increase the priority of their employees pay  not necessarily over profits otherwise theres no company and no job in the first place but so that employees can still get wealth of their own to some extent.,JoeRogan,cz35gmz,11,t5_2s4tv

6312008,1,t1_cz72f96,Full Disclosure I am very proJapan and I used to live in Tokyo. It is full of humble hardworking and polite people and is a magnificent country. That being said WW was a time full of harsh realities that are almost unfathomable in modern times but they were what they were It saved lives because given the circumstances at the time any alternative action would have resulted in more Japanese deaths.  If you think the two  nuclear bombs cost a lot of lives you would be shocked to find out what a joint land invasion from Soviet and US troops would do. Even if the US did NOTHING said lol lets go home you guys are allllright! and just quit the war USSR continues their invasion of Japan. The USSR had already refused to enter negotiations for conditional surrender.  Also the soviet soldiers are not reputed for showing discretion during WW when invading their enemies. The amount of rapes and murders in Germany are estimated to be so high that even the most generous estimates are incredible in scope. The only way you can argue that the bombs did not end the war is if you accept the narrative that Japan was going to surrender. This is pure fantasy. Not only did Japan refuse to surrender after the st bomb but former PM General Tojo advised the Emperor to persist in the war even after the nd. When the Emperor made his final radio address first one as well to tell the people to surrender there was an armed military resistence to take the recording to prevent it from being played so the war could continue. Japan showed no signs of imminent surrender and all those involved both US and Japan including the emperors own words in his radio address say that the nuclear bombings were THE direct cause for the surrender of Japan. He could have been lying for no reason but this is the case.  Soviets made a separate war declaration against Japan and seeing the writing on the wall that they could not defend themselves having their steel and munitions manufacturing crippled by the strategic nuclear strikes the Emperor made the choice to surrender to the US and pray for a merciful transition of power. IF the war persists USSR will continue their invasion. If war persists the mass starvation of Japanese children continues even if both sides were to refuse to invade for some reason.  And anything other than unconditional surrender means war within  years like what we saw in Korea. So thats how they saved lives. It was total war. Every action meant deaths and you are responsible for the lives of thousands of people for every little thing you do. Shooting a man in peace time is evil but shooting a man in war time to save the lives of  other men is the kind of decisions that WW leaders were faced with every single day the war persists. And on a side note the Ready to Surrender argument is worthless because so what if Japan was ready to surrender... they still had not surrendered. They were warned that the nuclear test was successful and they would be using the weapons on mainland Japan to cripple the war infrastructure. But they didnt surrender... so the war goes on.  And if you are Truman and the lives of millions of young American men hang in the balance how do you look a mother who lost her young teen son in the eyes and say we could have ended the war months ago virtually in an instant but Japan was totes ready to surrender!   It was the only responsible action... end the war ASAP or face a land invasion and an eventual proxy war with a new antagonistic Socialist Japanese state. Obviously the power of nukes today is so strong and what we know about nuclear radiation it is not acceptable to use them anymore. They exist as a deterrent. And a powerful one at that. So far few inventions have saved more lives than nuclear bombs. They prevented WW... but clearly they are so powerful that they have the destructive potential to be our undoing as a race.  They should never be used... but at that time? Their use saved the lives of millions by taking away Japans ability to even pretend to be able to fight even if their will remained iron. TLDR Sometimes there are harsh truths. The fact nuclear bombs saved lives is a testament to how horrifically fucked up the whole war was but the facts are facts. ,JoeRogan,cz73scg,3,t5_2s4tv

We have to start with campaign finance reform. Then rewrite all of our patent laws. Then restructure our higher education system.

Without that child being in an atrisk group for HIV there is remarkably little to indicate that you should circumcise a child. There are some indications that HPV can be avoided with circumcision but there are also vaccines for that.To put it another way truly and honestly imagine being raised in a culture where circumcision was not normal. Then try to imagine being one of those scientists you just quoted trying to go in front of an IRB and convince the board that they should allow you to gather  infant boys into a study in which you will cut off part of the dicks of  of those boys.

The example you provided and your comment just seems misplaced. I see in there people with mixed feelings saying they are not surprised he takes a step back from commentating. I dont understand why haters would come to a fan centric sub criticize his expertise and expect to be upvoted for it. Post your comment in an MMA forum and maybe you get better Karma. I dont know I dont follow MMA.The JoeRogan sub was uniquely creepy. I am not going to look for specific examples. But Rogan repeatedly tried to prove he was gay with clips from his  hour long podcast which who cares if he is closeted or straight he is a podcast comedian. I dont see a rbillburr to criticize his hypocrisies and foible calling him gay regularly. Honestly the most questionable material that has gained traction on this sub has happened since rjoerogan shut down.

In the movie the FBI mentions the  doses of LSD Bulger had taken which makes him extremely dangerous and unpredictable. I read about him for a while after the movie and apparently he was a test subject in the MKUltra illegal experiments. Does his involvement with the experiment make the CIA even partly responsible for his behavior after the experiment? This may be a stupid question but I feel like dosing an already unstable person with potent mind altering drugs is asking for trouble.

Hes been making the same arguments he did when the SJW phenomena became more obvious around .  Im sure most of his listeners dont need to be convinced its a problem.Besides in my opinion Its really not the most important culture wars issue in the west anyway.  It really depends on ones circumstance and where youre getting your news.  University professors live in a world steeped in SJW culture so of course from a perspective of people like Peterson and Gad Saad the world is collapsing.

9810097,0,t3_5e6j8v,I expected more of Chris Bell after his previous documentaries and what I have heard from him on various podcasts. Kratom absolutely mimics opiates and gets you high and when the subject came up about him being sober but on kratom I had to shake my head. Sorry but he isnt sober if he is taking as much kratom as he says he is. Several things he said were clearly an addict justifying himself. However I agreed with him later on when he says So what if I am addicted to kratom. I could be addicted to coffee but so what if it doesnt hurt me. I absolutely agree with that because drug use isnt a problem in and of itself. Drug abuse is the problem.  If the use does not cross over into abuse where you start hurting yourself it isnt a problem. When I looked into it and tried it there wasnt a lot of info about the safety of it so I dont know what should be done about it.  If it is as safe as he says it is then it sucks that they want to criminalize it. I know there are a lot of accounts of people that were able to get off of opiates with it and go on to live healthier lives. Making it illegal will hurt them.,JoeRogan,damaz58,0,t5_2s4tv

He moved to a tribal part of Yemen where the is no rule of law.  No cops no military the only justice system that exists is the village elders.  This is also an area that has been at war for the better part of its existence so the locals aint exactly thrilled to see foreigners looking to take home one of their own.He and his Pakistani sidekick were putting out an online magazine that was specifically made to entice native English speakers to commit lone wolf terrorist attacks in the west.  He was providing the knowledge and motivation for unstable individuals to hurt or kill lots of people.  On top of that he was actually facilitating other attacks with AQAP as well as being active on jihadi sites.So what is your plan to get him to trial in the US?

Heres a summary of the term StrawmanA straw man is logical fallacy that occurs when a debater intentionally misrepresents their opponents argument as a weaker version and rebuts that weak amp fake version rather than their opponents genuine argument. Intentional strawmanning usually has the goal of  avoiding real debate against their opponents real argument because the misrepresenter risks losing in a fair debate or  making the opponents position appear ridiculous and thus win over bystanders.Unintentional misrepresentations are also possible but in this case the misrepresenter would only be guilty of simple ignorance.

All you have to do is Google are White Millenials as racist as their parents. Fuck it here is a linkTo be clearer about the poll it says that that the ratio of selfadmitted racist among the the white millenial generation is the same as the ratio of white in the previous generation the Millenials parents. Is this clear enough for you?Would you agree that white people in general despised getting called racist? If so why would they wrongly selfincriminate themselves in the questionnaire. I would think that if people answered dishonesty they would answer in a nonracist way.Of course if you never believe any polls its hard to continue the discussion on this subject.

10541312,0,t1_dd2y33l,the process mostly for me  months of pretrial confinement not just detention that was eventually ruled to have been unreasonably harsh and unlawful. A mostly closed hearing in effect where roughly  of the proceedings have never been disclosed so the public has no way of knowing exactly how conclusive the evidence was. If you believe she deserves punishment because of what she disclosed it should trouble you that we dont know exactly what was disclosed and what its impact was. Her intention was ruled to be irrelevant. It wouldnt have mattered whether she blew the whistle to uncover unconstitutional acts or to help another country. most of the evidence has never been disclosed or was heavily redacted on release. again we dont know if the prosecution stretched the facts or their implications and given how hard the Obama admin went after whistleblowers there is reason to suspect it wasnt altogether fair  of the  SIGACTS charged against Manning were already in the public domain which means their disclosure wasnt an offence Evidence of actual damage was excluded from the trial President Obama himself has said the information revealed in the WikiLeaks publication of the Afghan War Diary was already known.  ThenSecretary of Defense Robert Gates wrote a letter to the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee explaining that a Department of Defense review of the leaked SIGACTS had not revealed any sensitive intelligence source and methods. there are other similarly problematic things that place me on her side in this matter.

Now Im not saying that Trump colluded with Russia but to assume the paid Russian shill factory hasnt made its way to rthedipshit is just absurd.EDIT In case you deem NYT to be fake news you can read an official government report re paid foreign actors influence on our most recent election including the near nonstop barrage of halftruths misleading statements and outright lies fed to the American public online oftentimes right here on Reddit. Here is a link to the government report released January  of this year.

I also think  of the stuff he says is true or at least based on fact so its not all BS. The CIA did traffic cocaine for their own benefit for  years but he failed to bring up the connection to the clintons in AR. What disappointed me the most is his own inability to back up his own stuff in any coherent form. For instance his primary evidence for Pizzagate was Jerry Sandusky and Dennis Hastert. Basically hes saying Pedobear exists so pizzagate is real. But when pressed on the details he cant get any more concrete than that Podesta emails seem fishy. Also every  minutes he said ok are you guys really ready Im going to lay it ALL out right now and then proceeded to wander through his own stream of consciousness.

Literally anyone could tell just from looking at their truthometer shit and seeing that most of it is lies by ommision misleading reporting and outright lies.gtBut I mean politifact is fake news right? He didnt really say any of those things in your eyes I supposeIt categorically actually is. Look at a few democrats truthometers on that website then look at the republicans. There is such an obvious bias that it hurts. Youre being willingly ignorant. Go ahead and google politifact bias and youll be greeted by plenty of proof that the website is biased including an entire other website being dedicated to calling it out. The owner of the website is a lefty who pushes their agenda through the site have some COMMON FUCKING SENSE.gtYou havent really done anything here but insult me I fail to see how you have any intregrity.Because people like you deserve nothing but condescension.

Im not a pharmacist now I work in industry as a bioinformatician but in my time in hospitals I can tell you I saved lives on a daily basis even as a pharmacy tech catching the prescribing errors.  doctors know very very little compared to even pharmacy students when it comes to medications.  but pharmacists are about as trained in medicine as doctors are in medications they are two sides of the same coin essentially.  however often doctors dont know anything about any drugs outside of their specific field and most even within their field  but pharmacists are typically generalists knowing every drug class that exists and of course many specialize like chemo or pediatricthe more you know!  pharmacists even in a retail setting also mostly have PharmDs doctorate degree since it was required in the s and are amazing free resources  they are basically free doctors you can see and get some basic medical advice from obviously not diagnoses or anything to which they will point you to a doctor if you need one and of course the proper information about any medication.  always make sure you check with your pharmacist on any new meds you are prescribed doctors have minimal understanding of interactions with other medications and will more likely than not miss any lifestyle factors that may interact with your medication as well.,JoeRogan,decbwpl,4,t5_2s4tv

He is a president and a political figure which means he de facto has an argument and ideological bent which you are free to inform yourself about but instead choose to act like you dont know his position because he cant explain it.

11456871,0,t1_dfukdav,Dude that actually sounds fascinating! Coincidentally one of those books I read was called Hardcore Zen sorta autobiography about a punk rocker who went on to be a Zen Priest it introduced me to Buddhism. The basic idea is  parts Life is suffering suffering is caused by desire you can get rid of suffering by getting rid of desiring things you can learn to do that by following the eightfold path think Buddhist  commandments.So Im not trying to get super philosophical but if you buy into that notion your circumstances will nearly always be secondary to your perspective therefore your lifes meaning isnt tied to your job per se its derived from living a good life which can be done at basically any job. I think this is where Sam Harris is coming from.However those who have to discover their own lifes meaning unlike Christians Buddhists pretty much every religionspirituality I think default to looking towards jobs or money or being great at something or whatever. I think even if you live in a Utopia of unimaginable perfection no money every luxury you would still be in pain when you stub your toe or pissed when the vending machine gets jammed. If youre the best fighter in the world it isnt going to last. There is nothing you can do or obtain that will naturally bring meaning to your life I believe you have to assign something that value then work towards that and if you have half a conscience it will probably be something that helps somebody else even if that is serving them McDoubles.,JoeRogan,dfummjr,2,t5_2s4tv
