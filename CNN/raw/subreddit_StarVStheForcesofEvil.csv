Probably using Stars book of spells for her own reasons but not for good or evil purposes.Considering how Ludo wants the wand and weve seen Lobster Claws hold Stars wand amp it transformed in a way to fit him Im leaning towards anyone can use the wand since I doubt Ludo and Lobster Claws are native to Mewni.,StarVStheForcesofEvil,ct7zbr1,2,t5_32uti

He is practicing dacing after class for a solo dancing competition. Star comes across him and luckily she has some refreshments so she goes see him practicing and give him some refreshments. When he rests he asks her to dance a song with him Star excitedly agrees. Marco start to dance and Star follow the dance surprisingly well. Some romantic connection was made on that event  you know what i mean Dancing scene  After staying in Earth Stars mom call her and said that she had to go back to Mewni to take over her throne so she would have to go back for a while or even wont see Marco again. On the last night on Earth Star meets Marco on the balcony. It is a night with a cresent moon. Marco want to have sth to remember between them so he asks for one last dance and Star agrees. So they dances after that Star realizes she is in love with Marco so she gives him a kiss one last kiss.

7198995,0,t1_d1wf8n4,Yeah you totally zigged when I zagged. The only thing I mentioned was the pilot episode. This has nothing to do with monomyths or plot devices. All in saying is what if after Marco and Star defeated Ludo and his gang for the first time on the walk home Marco says something along the lines of I guess we should tell your parents that monster followed you here and know where you are? This would have given more character development and would have covered the weird hiding magic from the parents plot point in process. Nothing you mentioned would have been changed.

Apart from the stilted way she unnecessarily reminded everyone that she has a crush on Oscar shes also the first to attack the cube in order to prevent it from extracting the truth and the first to figure out that the way people  especially teenagers  feel changes from moment to moment.  So she doubles down on common knowledge tries to prevent the cube from revealing the truth and realizes that the truth is flexible and unpredictable glancing down at Marco as she says it.Star figured out the paradox of the cube because in that moment she realized her crush shifted to Marco not Oscar.  You could argue that this was triggered by Marco confessing to Jackie and her not rejecting him but regardless theres no other factor that triggered her to come to that conclusion when she did.,StarVStheForcesofEvil,d83q9qg,24,t5_32uti

9751408,0,t3_5eto7l,Ive made a poll for the same question a couple of days ago results believe that Starco will happen later in season . believe that Starco will happen but not for a long time basically not until late into the last season believe that Starco will happen at the end of season  and them dating will be further explored in season  believe that Starco will happen in the shows final episode or episodes if they are directly linked believe that Starco wont happen directly but will be heavily implied in the end. believe that Starco wont happen until the very last scene so basically a kiss and the shows over or something believe that Starco wont happen at all.I personally think that well have to wait quite a while but Id be pleasantly surprised if it already happened in the season  finale. Why? Well aside from being Starco trash I think that theres so much untapped potential for stories when it comes to an actual relationship between main characters not only in cartoons but in general.Almost all stories end with the start of the actual relationship because the writers are too scared to write a romantic dynamic between main characters but I think that Star. Vs could really pull it off and it would be refreshing to see.They already created a very cute and believable friendship between Star and Marco why not rise to the challenge and create a cute and believable couple?,StarVStheForcesofEvil,daf2sef,10,t5_32uti

I was expecting others to play the video and then read the incantations while listening to see which wordings are more fitting.The point is that each version could imply something for the show. If we go with the st one it would mean that the wand is never Stars which will be interesting but confusing at the same time. If we go with the nd it will mean that the reason why miniunicorn appeared at the end of Storm the Castle will be because of Stars love for the wand or StarampMarcos bond.  If we go with the rd it shows that the Whispering Spell is actually really sinister with the last implication that the MiniUnicorn is actually jailed in the wand being forced to run for his whole life and the only way out is to die.

10122227,0,t1_dbqkflx,Mackie predated the airing of this episode IIRC. Some ships have names that way too similar for their own good e.g. Jarco and Janco and there was still no consensus in the fandom at the time.I personally preferred Mackie. It had a nice sound to it. But you know how this works and the name that the most people use is the one that rules the fandom. Like that time Nency used Marar on Twitter instead of Starco it surprised us all but the name didnt stick at all.I think the fandom would benefit from ship names that arent necessarily a combination of the names if the participants. I just am not  comfortable with two ships with drastically different implications being differentiated by just one letter.,StarVStheForcesofEvil,dbqxlqc,2,t5_32uti
10132820,0,t3_5ky1bf,You know what I love most about this show? It has the potential to be better than Avatar. And even if it doesnt utilize that potential to the fullest what we still have is a cartoon that I think is better a better overall show than Steven Universe hands down. Although SU does have richer more complex characters I feel that not only does Star makes its ideas a part of the characters a la destiny responsibility etc and world as opposed to making the ideas the characters themselves. And while Star isnt as mature as SU I say its an allaround better show because its writing is so strong  the foreshadowing is subtle to a degree that actually makes the viewer feel smart when they put it together the energy and pacing is always in sync with one another and Star manages to always strike a nice balance between story and silliness. Plus it gives its ideas time to fester rather than give arbitrary focus for a handful of episodes and then never again. ,StarVStheForcesofEvil,dbsb8gh,3,t5_32uti

10224245,0,t1_dc2x752,Thanks! I wanted to tailor the horrors to Stars character traits. What does Star really fear? Being unloved being stuck in royal duties that are like slavery being controlled and imprisoned. A fate filled with all these things would be the worst for her plus the added bonus of marital rape by a literal monster who doesnt even lust after her but just wants an heir  something extra for her to look forward to. Also realistic  this exact thing was the normal expected fate of princesses in the real world well not marriage to a lizard but to a more figurative monster. They were usually married for alliances not for love and were expected to breed heirs. ,StarVStheForcesofEvil,dc2z4ky,7,t5_32uti

That and the realization that everything started to fall apart. Now Marcos reaction definitely seems to imply that he knows somethings wrong but that could be just from the fact that he didnt expect her to be so upset about losing Glossarick and the book. Overall I think the hugging thing is open to interpretation.  I do agree with you though that one of the great things about this show is how much you can get from the slight gestures and actions of all the characters.

Monsters overwhelm Mewmans with magic that draws out primal bloodlust and makes Mewmens evil and forced them to fight eachother. Call out Mewman attrocities within earshot of Star and Marco and how this was inevitable. Star and Marco join the fray and Star loses her wand the two halves being reunited.Starcrushed  Battle continues with a great summoning of ancient Monsters being attempted and Stars side fights to stop the great evil from being completed. As the night goes on the tainting gets stronger and starts affecting Stars family. Star and Marco recon into the Monster group and ruin the summoning preparation. Marco ends up with the wand and gets tainted with the evil urges. He detroys the castle and ends the battle by banishing the monsters to another dimension glancing at Star and promptly joining them then leaves with the monsters.I think Earth is a pretty great place...,StarVStheForcesofEvil,dc84xo5,2,t5_32uti

10513364,0,t1_dczr6cc,Sure. But to my mind it is more consistent with Stars character for her to not want to talk to Marco because she simply doesnt want to confront her personal issues than for her to want to talk to Marco but be unable to do so. I see Stars main struggle as being one to honestly face her feelings to herself not finding it difficult to express those feelings once faced. She is quite unlike Marco in this  Marco very accurately dissected his own feelings for Jackie in Sleepover but really had to be pushed  repeatedly  to express them to Jackie by Star the Punishment Box the Naysaya and finally  Jackie asking him out. I can see Star totally denying even to herself that she had romantic feelings for Marco  even when it is obviously making her miserable. In Bon Bon for example rather than openly admit I now realize I have a romantic attachment to Marco and seeing him with another girl makes me upset Star repeatedly came up with increasingly absurd reasons why she was unhappy  Marco had ditched her at the last minute which wasnt cool Jackie was imitating Marcos beauty spot ... ,StarVStheForcesofEvil,dczsvoz,1,t5_32uti

No Janna No Jackie No Tom No Buffrog No Marcos Parents.Jackie and Marco dating but not once having been shown talking to each other in the same place even once.Star reconnecting with both her old friends but also her old hangout spot.An upcoming episode called Just Friends and the following one with an ominous episode description.

10831150,0,t3_5uszmu,I feel kinda certain that Toffee wasnt always the clearcut  villain we see now. Moon has shown herself to have a lot of stuff she only vaguely hints at.Ive done a lot of things you wont be doing.Star cant possibly get ALL of her wild streak from her dad. I mean Moon married a man who was essentially a barbarian warrior. Its also about time Star and Moon had a bonding episode as so far her father has had plenty of episodes but Moon and Stars relationship while clearly having love there never gets much screentime and has always been displayed as somewhat strained and a little awkward due to Moons opinions being different to Stars and her often showing that she thinks forward to the future of Mewni under Stars rule and what she feels is best for the kingdom rather than what Star wants. Its about time Star and her mother had a real hearttoheart and about time we learned more about the Moon who existed Before all the weight and responsibility of being the ruler of Mewnie made her the woman she is now.Whats more Glossaryks complete lack of surprise at Toffees resurgence and the way they speak to one another makes me think that the two must have been pretty well acquainted beforehand.I dont wanna say that Toffee and Moon had some kind of relationship but I feel as though the two did not start out as bitter enemies as is portrayed in the painting in Stars mind. ,StarVStheForcesofEvil,ddx5np9,2,t5_32uti

10836117,0,t1_ddxcz8r,The only way it wont be worth it is if you dont learn anything. There are jobs in animation but you shouldnt go to college with the thought that your education will get you a job yknow? You go to college to learn stuff. How that stuff gets applied in your life is a pretty complicated bit of stuff sometimes. But if you love animating and you learn stuff about a thing you love your course was worth it. Also start practicing now. Theres no reason you need to wait until next year to animate. Get a stickit notepad and start making flip books. They cost like a dollar and theyre a ton of fun to make. If you want to work on some specific skills ahead of your class Id suggest making a ball bounce realistically an exercise in squashandstretch making a bag of flour jump an exercise in weight and mass distribution making a bag of flour walk walk cycles are one of the hardest things to animate properly so taking things like arms and legs out of the equation will help you wrap your brain around the basics and making flag wave a fun exercise in threedimensionality because you never see the whole flag at once  there are always folds. You can try on your own or find guides to each of these exercises online. I practice at least one of them and a bunch of others every couple of weeks just to make sure Im keeping my basics sharp. Plus the bouncing ball is just fun to do. For extra difficulty put a face on it! ,StarVStheForcesofEvil,ddxo3ao,2,t5_32uti

10918809,0,t3_5vzutr,Star has sovereign immunity from prosecution. Literally. Sovereign immunity or as it is sometimes called State immunity is a principle of law by which one country may only be sued in the courts of another with their consent express or implied  in the olden days it literally applied to the person of the nations sovereign that is their King or Queen. It also applied to heirs to a nations throne. It is similar to but more significant than diplomatic immunity. Star is undisputed heir to the throne of Mewni. Therefore she is not liable to process of law except with her or the queens consent. She can be declared persona non grata and expelled back to Mewni but not sued or jailed for crimes or wrongdoing she has committed. ,StarVStheForcesofEvil,de675ad,7,t5_32uti

Considering Jannas lack of lines or discernible actions in that episode I think she might have just been stuck in as a generic background character.She was initially on that list of fillin characters in season  so at least its somewhat understandable perhaps she is still on it technically but why she wouldnt be removed by now I have no idea.,StarVStheForcesofEvil,dedfgy1,1,t5_32uti

10990076,0,t3_5wxbyb,Heres the problem with the term plot device.In most cases this term could be applied to nearly any character that is not a main character. This is not a rule that is setinstone but it is why the are supporting characters they literally support the main characters and typically exist for some prescribed reason.Take Marcos Sensei for example. He went from being essentially an unimportant extra in the first season to being Marcos cautionary tale of who he could ultimately end up as by the time Red Belt came out. In that sense he was a plot device. However by the time All Belts Are Off came out Marco had restored respect of his Sensei and began budding with him as friends implying that he is moving away from solely being there for a specific reason and towards simply being in Marcos life because he wants to.Contrast this with Janna. You could probably ask yourself what purpose does she really have in the show? and you would probably draw a blank. Janna is an ascended extra brought to the front solely on how entertaining she is and on the potential of her meshing well with one or both of the main characters. People can have friends just for the sake of it and to Star Janna is one of those friends.Because of this it should be completely possible for the same to happen to Jackie. She is nowhere near the most developed character right now and I dont claim for her to be. However over her past  major appearances we have gotten some insight as to what she admires and values weve seen some of her emotions besides chill sneak through and weve seen her take such a liking to Marco that she drops that facade altogether and just goofs around with him.Jackie started off as a plot device literally the satellite love interest. They are progressing slow as Marco is still understandably nervous and in that way is pretty damn realistic. Stars confession just tossed everything up in the air and we now see a visually distressed Jackie. It is now evident that she has true admiration for Marco if the threat of Star someone she cant naturally compete with causes her to stand in shock. And Jannas concerned expressions towards her are given too much focus to not be important.She assuredly has the potential to be something far more than Marcos love interestgirlfriend. The writers just have to want for it to happen.,StarVStheForcesofEvil,dedov2w,1,t5_32uti

11003017,0,t1_deex8rs,I know right I like reading it but it was ultimately just a tease. I was wondering if you or someone else remember the threads about the ships because I felt they were a tease as well. In the post the person would talk about one ship at a time then I think the next day post the next ship. Leading with the weakest one then the last two it would be Jarco and finally Starco. Here the person would say things we would already know but it felt like it was leading to something and then just end with why they didnt think it wouldnt work and Starco was the only one that would. The last two were the longest with Starco being the strongest in terms of how long the post was. Sorry if this was too long and doesnt make any sense. But I remember last year reading each post and wondering to myself why it wasnt really expanded upon and it would just end with something along the lines of I dont believe it could work.

But you are probably right it is more then likely just bad writing but being part of this community at least for me means any lore to make the show more loved is better then the reality.

11033560,0,t1_deileh4,gt And again if they just started Jarco so they can segue it into Starco its lazy. No its subjective crap.Its subjective. What you said is the same as me saying Jarco is lazy because Boy gets girl he loved since forever is an old clich. As Ive said before I see solutions for the current situation that would be lazy and some that wouldnt be. Both for Starco and for Jarco. At this point the past interactions between the characters simply would make StarCo easier to achieve naturally. I agree with you that JarCo needs to be fleshed out Jarco read Jackie needs to grow at least a bit to allow for it to end without actually being lazy or it needs to grow a lot to be able to overshadow the Starco of the past  seasons and establish itself.The measuring device for this is Marco. Hes together with girl hes had a crush on for years but whom he doesnt really know much yet. On the other side the girl whom he still only regards as a friend yet he shares a much deeper connection with told him about her feelings towards him.Several times now he has unwittingly interrupted close moments with Jackie to look aftertalk to Star. This is a sign that for now Star is whats actually on his priority list. In order to see a satisfying JarCo ending Jackie would have to grow as a character and interact with Marco to a point where Marco lets Star wait for him in order to finish his current interaction with Jackie. In my opinion that would be the first actual sign that JarCo is more than a phase.,StarVStheForcesofEvil,deimni6,1,t5_32uti

Moon was the first to work with him and something went wrong. So we see he had given up on changing them and instead wants them to suffer by means of how they oppressed the monsters with magic.

11329166,0,t3_61owcp,Youre not the first person to want this and I do agree that it may need an update not because of the animation style or upbeat song but because it doesnt make sense anymore. Stars wand should be broken Ludo shouldnt have his old monsters and Star just left Earth so the beginning bit with her being sent to Earth doesnt make much sense.However while Im not certain about the intro changing the outro most certainly will have a change considering it didnt even exist in Starcrushed and Star cant sing about Earth being great since shes not on Earth. Im expecting that it will be similar to the original but change a few of the lines and replace Earth with Mewni.

But Heckapoo and Omnitraxus Prime are definitely extradimensional beings while Lekmet and Rhombulous are clearly not standard Mewmans if in fact theyre from the Mewman dimension at all.Glossaryck mentions that Mewberty is just nature taking its course and clearly it has links with magic Moon seems much more powerful with her magic in this form. Now its the question whether its just the Butterfly clan which goes through Mewberty or not with the Johansen clan being so different it wouldnt be a stretch to say that only those affiliated with the royal family would go through this transformation and with River seemingly unable to use magic or at least not showing any affinity for it it could be seen as only certain mewnian clans can use magic.Or whatever.

11549508,0,t3_64spe0,I love dream analysis. This is very interesting in the context that both Star and Marco are hidingdenying feelings for one another. For Star it took seeing Marco with Jackie in both Bon Bon and Just Friends to push her feelings to the surface. For Marco its a bit more buried do to his insecurities. But it takes the thought of Star leaving him Mewberty and BMB and now with Starcrushed to unearth his.,StarVStheForcesofEvil,dg551es,2,t5_32uti

11557330,0,t3_64ytpk,My headcannon is this. Marco just cant get Star out of his mind once she is gone despite every effort possible. Heck I can even imagine him begging his family to toss out the couch and nachossauces to avoid thinking about Star. He will try to push her out of his life as much as possible...but he cannot. He feels depressed and gives up. Jackie notices this and despite her efforts they just arent working. She calls Marco up one day and the two agree to take a break at least until Marco comprehends his own emotions. Jackie allows him to go after Star despite the fact she feels hurt he cares more about Star then herself. The promise Marco made was broken and she IS pissed about that...but she knows Marco is a good person and is emotionally confused. Jackie tries to move on from Marco but ends up meeting Tom for some reason either from joining Marco in his search group for Star him coming to Earth for whatever reason etc and the two hit it off. They become friends and by the end of the season ponder the idea of dating each other. Marco comes back from Mewni with Star with Jackie already knowing they are going to be a thing. Jackie resents Star but not to the point of being hostile towards her. She isnt mad at Marco as they called off the realtionship before he ventured after her. IF Marco goes after Star before they call of the relationship that is when things get more complicated. Marco looks like a prick to Jackie leaving her for a magical princess and he really broke his promise in that case. That will be a major conflict when he comes back to Earth trying to repair a now tarnished friendship with Jackie. ,StarVStheForcesofEvil,dg60zw7,16,t5_32uti

Which to be honest may play a role in him being my favourite character but whatever....I liked your last point. Obviousely in our case the splitpersonality are really two people but It got me wondering if Ludo has a mind which is especially easy to posses due to what happened to him as child. I mean say he has some of the points you made above is depersonalising at times or feeling like the world does not quite feel real. Wouldnt that sort of mind be more susceptible to bring manipulated and taken over than a mind with a better grasp on reality and its connections to itself?   I thought before that Toffeewand waited for a mind which wax just the right amount of unwell to lure to him and that the isolation Ludo was in got him to that point after odd days but your points may play a toke too.oh and great catch on Ludos sibling rivalry with Star! ,StarVStheForcesofEvil,dgcximm,2,t5_32uti
