782484,0,t1_cgt74g9,Your user name does your comments justice nice try to spin what the underlying matter concerning the plebiscite was though. Keep in mind that the JPR was conducted solely to define the merits of the NGP. The JPR gave it the green light. If the people disagree with the JPR that means with little doubt that they dont agree with the NGP. Youve got your head too far up your ass if you believe they voted no because the JPRs recommendations were too strict.Im not against marine safety but I am against hidden agendas and thats all Im pointing out  that this investment was done for marine safety for the overall good is incorrect it was done in part to increase marine safety to support one of BCs  requirements for the NGP. Stop trying to put words in my mouth. What I am against is putting dilbit in tankers off the coast and for good reason Pipeline safety is inadequate and specifically throughout the KitimatTerrace area where glaciomarine clays pose added risk. All that Enbridge has said thus far regarding safety is trust us  Im not against pipelines either simply because I voice concern over the project. What I am against are poorly constructed proposals with little evidence to support claims. I dont doubt that the project will continue to improve its standards and this is certainly one small step towards that but the fact that it needs to be hounded and opposed on so many levels shows what a shitty project it is and how little thought actually went into it. The reason Im pointing these facts out is not because marine safety is increasing but because they believe increasing marine safety will resolve the dilbit issue which is not the case at all. No one complains about the LNG because it doesnt behave like DilBit when a spill occurs.  ,britishcolumbia,cgt80go,2,t5_2qnc6

Shes learned this the hardest way imaginable. Shell be shamed in her community for the rest of her life. She may end up with a criminal record fines and other penalties when she also already has existing mental struggle. She might commit suicide or at the least be at a very high risk of it.I feel terrible for those poor dogs their owners too. But I also feel sorry for this woman. Her life is about to end as much as it can while she still breathes and passes time. I am strongly in favour of increased penalties to people who are cruel and abusive to animals. In the recent case where Huskys used during the olympic games were violently butchered by their owner once they became unprofitable I felt everyone involved should have recieved substantially more punishment then the bit they got.

1743985,0,t3_2dx9xb,I mean Im from Vernon so I always thought of Kelowna as being the least shitty place in the Okanagan. Its like a beacon of lessshittiness in a shit wasteland. Its got a decent group of people trying their damnedest to bring a more urbane vibe to the place my high school years would have been terrible if it werent for the Habitat and that filters down to Vernon too which is great.To put it bluntly growing up in the Valley sucks. Living in a place that is meant to be a vacation destination is very odd. Youre constantly at odds with what youre supposed to be doing. Im not Albertan I dont work in the oil patch and I dont actively participate in the Okanagan Lifestyle which appears to be enjoying World Class Golfing drinking World Class Wine living in World Class Suburban Neighbourhoods and generally being a stereotypical retiree. Basically I dont belong here. Even though Im from here and live here yearround.Its a little more tolerable when the weather gets shitty in fall and spring because the Albertan summerhomesnowbird crowd leaves and the places become a bit more localfocused but yeah. Its a weird place.I left for four years to go to school in Toronto before returning last year and its definitely gotten worse over that period. Maybe I changed I dont know. I used to lovingly hate it here now I just plain hate it.The lakes are nice and so is the skiing though. I like the cheap cherries and the smell of sagebrush in the evenings.

1753491,0,t1_ck037hp,This government has not even given cost of living raises to teachers in years. They have not kept up with the pace of inflation although most workplaces havent.. Still I dont feel they are being unreasonable. Starting wage for a teacher is around  and it take  years of seniority to get over that k hump.     Ok so you say the MLAs work harder then they are given credit for? Im sorry but you cannot compare having paid lunches by lobbyists every day work. Try to get a meeting with your MLA as a private citizen.. I will be impressed if you can get face time at all with your MLA and if you do I doubt it would be for more than a few minutes.. Unless of course you represent a business interest in which case they are all ears but I digress..     When the government acts in a blatantly illegal way proven by the courts but continues to waste tax payer dollars fighting the courts decision regarding class size even you have to admit something smells fishy. Why can they close  school in  years yet not be able to meet our childrens basic needs? This isnt the BCTF acting out of line this is a government with a direct agenda to disempower the union no matter the cost to our children society or the taxpayers wallet.    I can only assume you agree with our tax dollars subsidizing private for profit schools instead of the public school system.     School staffing levels are at an all time low. Special needs students are not getting the help they need. Good students are being ignored. One of the core principals of our Canadian society revolves around providing world class education for our children. This is why we pay taxs.     ,britishcolumbia,ck06ots,9,t5_2qnc6

Most do not choose homelessness meth or crime even if they said they did... seriously who in their right mind thinks they want to do meth one day.  There is a reason the person you know picked up meth that yeah typically that other stuff follows.  Itll probably be a pretty dark reason and the person struggled with copeing.

7885646,0,t3_4n7dgk,I did this raft run last year. It was great. There has been greatly increased traffic across the railway in the last few years. The reason for it is that highway improvements up river has caused the middle section of the river to become unnavigable to rafts. The rafts now pull  out at the rest stop and put in further down stream. This is where the crossing of the tracks happens.I can see the concern of CP is valid. The river raft crews do their best to control their customers around the track but people do stupid things. While we were there a train came by and some people were a little too close. A solution can be found but it will need the cooperation of all parties involved. The tour companies should be responsible for costs of a crossing IMHO.I sure hope this gets resolved.

I believe that the investigation figured out that no one had surveyed the soils under where the tailings pond wall was being build and that extra water being stored behind the wall from greater than usual rain contributed. Do you believe the remobilization of the mine waste would be enough to harm fish stocks within the lake? I mean its a huge amount of water and area.  ,britishcolumbia,db7ekta,3,t5_2qnc6

Yes I think that prices are too high but not just for groceries everywhere.The thing most people dont seem to understand is that the margins on groceries are really really tight. And some things like meat. produce milk eggs have more price volatility due to the fact that they arent processed. A producers chickens all get sick and the price of eggs jumps because theres less inventory or California continues to have a drought and you get lower quality higher costing produce.

10799854,0,t3_5ugme6,I used to drive between Kamloops amp Calgary for most long weekendsholidays for a few years in a WD pickup. If youve ever driven the Coq in winter expect it to be similar to that. The biggest differences is that it isnt  lanes the entire way there are many zones where stopping is prohibited due to avalanche danger and the speed limit changes in many spots usually drops from  to  in the National Parks IIRC.It isnt until you return to Kamloops that it becomes apparent how much tighter amp twistier the TCH is between Sicamous amp Kamloops than it is between Sicamous amp Alberta. In other words if youre used to the mountain roads surrounding the loops such as the Yellowhead the Fraser Canyon or  to the Okanagan the road weather amp wildlife conditions of the TCH from Golden to Banff is a snooze.The driverstraffic however is a different story. During a normal weekday its usually fine. There are plenty of rigs to deal with any time but on weekends and especially holidays such as this Alberta Family Day weekend is when you get a wide variety of drivers from old guys in new Corvettes doing  under the limit in summer to yahoos in lifted diesel trucks going  and passing on blind corners to foreign tourists in rental carsRVs stopping on the narrow shoulder to feed the bears seriously smdh.TLDR Dont worry about the roads any more than you would the ones around here.
