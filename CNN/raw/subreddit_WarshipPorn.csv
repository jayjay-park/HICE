However when taking in operational requirements it was realized that having antiaircraft escorts which could keep up with a carrier capable of making  knots nonstop might be worth the extra cost. After all even though a carrier might be able to steam  miles in a week she couldnt do so when her escorts run low on gas after a few days and have to take on fuel in an UNREP.

1114907,0,t3_25l9mt,Ive asked this before on rsubmarines but got no answer so maybe Ill have better luck here...It seems to me that one of the biggest difficulties in submarine targeting is getting accurate measures of distance to target in a passive way. With that solved accuracy would have increased dramatically I imagine. Why did submarines never use two widelyspaced periscopes for rangefinding in the style of gun targeting systems of surface warships? Most subs already had two periscopes but they were not linked in any way and were too close together of course.If you check out this patent the idea was filed in  a little late. The only serious difficulty it talks about there I think is getting the image from both periscopes into one place where measurement of differences can be made. And the patent solves it by using electronics. I guess some fiddly mirrorbased system would be needed in WWII. But Im still surprised that kept the technology from even being tried. Any idea why this would be too difficult to do with WWII technology?,WarshipPorn,chv0vde,1,t5_2tg3p

Wow who knew? Because the  Iraqi army with its  vintage Ts and  vintage ISs is clearly an adequate model for predicting the behaviour of a top rate fighting force.Did you know that during the Spanish civil war massed tank formations were ineffective and found to be inferior to anti tank guns?Shortsighted people with your flawed mindset took those lessons from Spain as proof that the anti tank gun was superior to the tank and that tanks should not be used in concentrated divisions.Thats what the British and French did.The Germans ignored the lessons from Spain because they knew the Spanish were too poorly trained and incompetent to accurately simulate what massed tanks were capable of if used properly. Just as nobody uses the performance of the Iraqi Army or the Iraqi air force to detemine how good a T or Mig is because everyone knows that one in Russian or other competent hands is far deadlier than one used by poorly trained and poorly led Iraqis or some other third rate fighting force. Kind of like how the Israelis used captured Egyptian tanks far more effectively than the Egyptians had ever used them nothing wrong with the tank just the crews.But clearly Im wrong and youll be vindicated in  years time with the launching of the   ton displacement Iowa II super battleship by the USN with  inch guns!

1572133,0,t1_cjd53lu,I have to disagree.  Although SSN is horrible as a standalone work of literature I dont think you should consider it as such.  Most of Tom Clancys series of nonfiction books Armored Cav Special Forces Air Wing Submarine ect. have a relatively short fictional element in the middle to better illustrate how the military units featured in the rest of the book would work in a hypothetical situation.  The purpose of these sections is to inform the reader not impress them with character development exciting plot devices and all the rest of the stuff we learned in high school English class.  Submarine doesnt have that fictional section so I think SSN may be an extended standalone version.  I agree that the book has absolutely no character development and the plot is pretty thin where submarines are not directly concerned.  But it conveys to the reader how a Los Angeles class SSN works in combat.  It has some errors in accuracy but in general I think its pretty good.  Im not saying its for everyone and if you want a great novel read The Hunt for Red October.  The books I said to avoid are insulting to me because of their extreme factual errors and bad story telling in some cases too.  While SSN is a very flat book in terms of characters and dialogue I still remember the Chinese president telling Mack to watch his six I dont think the stuff thats there is too bad.

1836085,0,t1_ckadxux,I read somewhere recently that the demise of the Harriers may be being reported prematurely. These ships and their variants are popping up everywhere and US experience with them indicates that a small air wing even of relatively inexpensive jumpjets has an outsized effect when things get dicey. I think we may yet see another generation of Harriers or something very similar. The F wasnt built for that purpose and it is way too expensive for most militaries to put at significant risk unless their very survival is involved. Ergo another generation of comparatively cheap offtheshelf jumpjets may well emerge. I think thats a good thing and I hope the US leads the way in it.

2021836,0,t1_ckwthme,gt The ideato create a makebelieve battle squadron that could pass itself off at sea as realwas entirely Churchills. On October   he wrote to Prince Louis then still First Sea LordgtgtIt is necessary to construct without delay a dummy fleet ten merchant vessels . . . mocked up to represent battleships. . . . The actual size need not correspond exactly as it is notoriously difficult to judge the size of vessels at sea and frequently even destroyers are mistaken for cruisers. We are bearing in mind particularly aerial and periscope observations where deception is much more easy. It is not necessary that the structures be strong enough to stand rough weather. Very little metal would be required and practically the whole work should be executed in wood and canvas. . . . Even when the enemy knows we have such a fleet . . . he will always be in doubt as to which is the real and which is the dummy fleet. . .gt ... before the end of the month steamships were commandeered and brought to the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. ... Within a week wood and canvas structures were reproducing guns turrets boats tripod masts and bridges. Because a liner rises higher out of the water than a battleship the merchantmen were filled with thousands of tons of ballast to push the hulls lower. The shapes of bows and sterns were altered. False funnels were added and were equipped with fireplaces to burn combustible materials that would emit thick clouds of smoke. Navy anchors were made of wood or were simply painted on the bows.gt ...gt No one was fooled. Real battleship squadrons were usually made up of generally homogeneous ships. But when the dummies came together some were twice the size of the others. Their speeds varied greatly. Some could make  knots others  others only  and as a squadrons speed must be that of the slowest member  knots became the speed at which the dummies could steam together. A knot squadron could not operate with the knot Grand Fleet. The ships said Jellicoe could not accompany the fleet to sea and it was very difficult to find a use for them in home waters. The suggestion that they be used as bait was rejected. An encounter with the enemy would have led to massacre.gt ... At the end of April the dummy Queen Mary was sent to patrol off New York City as a message to the German liners interned in the harbor that if they violated their internment and tried to break out a British battle cruiser was waiting to gobble them up. The assault on the Dardanelles suggested another use the dummy battle cruisers Indomitable and Tiger departed Loch Ewe on February . To avoid being seen they passed through the Strait of Gibraltar at midnight and they were forbidden to enter the harbors of Gibraltar or Malta where they could be studied close up. The dummy Invincible followed six weeks later. Churchill hoped that by sending them to the Mediterranean where they might be seen at a distance they might mislead the Germans as to the margin of British strength in home waters and tempt the enemy to come out and do battle in the North Sea. The Turks did misidentify the dummy Tiger and reported her to a German submarine. On May  she was hit and sunk by torpedo and four British seamen drowned. A British midshipman with the Dardanelles fleet found grim humor in the event imagining the Uboat captain astonished to see the surviving crew clinging to the floating wooden turrets.gt Thereafter the curtain came down on the theatrical. Once Churchill left the Admiralty the dummy fleet which had cost Britain  million and four lives and Germany a single torpedo quickly disappeared.from Massie Castles of Steel,WarshipPorn,ckwtt8b,2,t5_2tg3p

2260084,0,t1_clr12t4,Again my opinions are not based on wikipedia or FAS or Janes.  I have seen significant errors in all three so I do not rely on them as sources at all.  My opinions are based on historical literature not anything on the internet.The  and  are not similar in their construction I never said anything like that.  Whether they were designed in Groton or Norfolk I think they are similar in their design philosophy make a huge submarine with a huge reactor.  Like you said there is very little specifically in common between the two classes but the influence of Rickover is clear in both.  A nuclear submarine built mostly for nuclear powers sake this is slightly less true for the Ohios as Trident factored into the design as well but the reactor situation is similar for both.  When I say the s are bad I mean it in relative terms.  Compared to the s they were quieter and faster and had an excellent sonar suite.  But they are lacking compared to what they could have been.  Natural circulation was on the table in the later s when SSN  was being designed which would have made the s almost as quiet as the Ohios.  Indeed Narwhal with her naturalcirculation SG was much quieter than the s several years before they put to sea.  If SSN  wasnt built around the unproven SG which Rickover demanded and instead used the proven SG it would have been much quieter much smaller probably cheaper and almost as fast.  Again Rickovers decision to build the submarine around SG and mass produce it was not because he wanted to increase the capabilities of American submarines but rather so he could have control.  Thats what he always wanted from his repair base on Okinawa in WWII to  when he was fired.  Even though it is difficult to criticize decisions made  years ago when I dont know all the circumstances and technical details I still think that the decision to make a submarine almost entirely for the sake of having a new and experimental reactor without concern for other capabilities is a very very poor one. A big part behind the delay of the Ohios was Rickovers toxic relationship with EB and other shipyards that made nuclear vessels.  At the end of Rickovers career the Navy had over a billion dollars in claims filed against them because of the unreasonable demands Rickover put on the shipyards.  In his ideal world shipyards would be completely nationalized so he could have complete control.  I can see where hes coming from but the degree to which he harassed shipyards and tried to gain control of them is ludicrous.Also you seriously think the Alfa class is a turd?  The Alfas had many problems but they were perhaps the most innovative submarines ever made.  Extraordinary high power density extensive automation revolutionary titanium construction and decent sonars and acoustic quieting.  Its especially incredible given these submarines were designed just shortly after the first Soviet nuclear submarine went to sea.  The Soviets had issues with them.  The reactors had to be hot all the time so they had to have steam pumped into them in port which was expensive.  They couldnt dive as deep as many people thought but they could still reach  ft.  They were extraordinarily fast but not any noisier than other Soviet SSNs of the period as most believe.  In the end it was a mixture of success and failure but at least the Soviets tried to innovate.  A Russian submarine designer once remarked that we had democracy in our submarine design.  You with Rickover had stalinist tyranny!  If you really want an example of a failure look at the Soviet Charlie SSGN or Tullibee SSKN.  Both were very slow and not much use to anyone. ,WarshipPorn,clr2fh6,2,t5_2tg3p

2993320,0,t3_2ugs5k,Fenian Ram is a submarine designed by John Philip Holland for use by the Fenian Brotherhood American counterpart to the Irish Republican Brotherhood against the British. The Rams construction and launching in  by the Delamater Iron Company in New York was funded by the Fenians Skirmishing Fund. Officially Holland Boat No. II the role of the Fenians in its funding led to the New York Sun to name the vessel the Fenian Ram.The Fenian Rams design was partly modelled on the Whitehead torpedo and like it had cruciform control fins near the tail. The boat did not simply take on ballast until she sank like other contemporary submarines she maintained a slightly positive buoyancy and simply tilted her horizontal planes so that her forward motion forced her under.Fenian Ram was armed with a nineinch pneumatic gun some eleven feet long mounted along the boats centerline and firing forward out of her bow. It operated like modern submarine torpedo tubes a watertight bow cap was normally kept shut allowing the sixfootlong dynamitefilled steel projectiles to be loaded into the tube from the interior of the submarine. The inner door was then shut and the outer door opened by a remote mechanism. Finally  psi . MPa air was used to shoot the projectile out of the tube. To reload the outer door was again shut and the water in the tube was blown into the surrounding ballast tank by more compressed air. It was powered by a  hp  kW Brayton piston engine.During extensive trials Holland made numerous dives and testfired the gun using dummy projectiles. However due to funding disputes within the IRB and disagreement over payments from the IRB to Holland the IRB stole Fenian Ram and the Holland III prototype in November . They took the submarine to New Haven Connecticut but discovered that no one knew how to operate it. Holland refused to help. Unable to use or sell the boat the Brotherhood had the Ram hauled into a shed on the Mill River.In  Fenian Ram was exhibited in Madison Square Garden to raise funds for victims of the Easter Rising. Afterwards she was moved to the New York State Marine School. Fenian Ram was placed in Patersons West Side Park in  as a monument to the inventor. In  it was moved inside the Paterson Museum where today it serves as a reminder of the ingenuity of the father of the modern submarine.,WarshipPorn,co897ot,5,t5_2tg3p

She proved to be one of the most technicallyperfect and reliable submarines of her time. Displacement of those submarines was  tons surfaced and  tons submerged. All the submarines of Bars type were equipped with two diesel engines which could develop a surface speed of . knots . kmh. Her speed submerged reaching . knots was secured by two electric motors. The armament consisted of twelve mm torpedotubes eight of them were Dzhevetskiy lattice systems and four tubular ones two artillery guns mm and mm and one machinegun. Those submarines could submerge  meters deep.The main drawback of Barstype submarines was the absence of waterproof bulkheads which decreased their vitality and floodability parameters. Commission of these submarines in  significantly enhanced the Baltic Sea Fleet operational capabilities.Sub names included Bars or Snow Leopard Gerard Gepard or Cheetah Pantera or Panther and Vepr or Wild Boar to mention a few.

I just meant for example that if  or  Super Hornets were sent to intercept a squadron of corvettes getting too close to a lone destroyer or  theres a chance however small that theyd be unsuccessful leaving the destroyers unprotected from the sky. Like I said before its a unlikely scenario but a scenario nonetheless.What situation would warrant four FAEF but not ArleighBurke destroyers or Ohio SSGNs? Its more likely youd see a few FC or XBs for recon followed by targeted strikes from nearby assets using midtolong range antiship missiles.China is far more of a risk than Russia. Present day Russian military capability follows the same USSR logic  bluff lie distort and proclaim until youre enemy thinks youre more powerful than you actually are. Putins bold new naval strategy cant be funded and what they do have is poorly maintained and made.On the other hand China has the funding to procure much better hardware. Problem is they still rely on Russian engines and other technologies. But apart from funding and technology China has no advantage to be gained from challenging American bluewater supremacy. They realize that China depends on the Americandominated seas for both receiving raw materials and shipping their products to global markets and are keenly aware that the most important of those markets is the United States. As such they are willing to compromise on most issues so long as the United States continues to allow freedom of the seas and an open market. China may bluster  seeing nationalism as a useful means of holding the regions of the country together  but it is not seeking a conflict with the United States. After all the United States utterly controls the seas and the American market and American security policy prevents the remilitarization of Japan. The pillars of recent Chinese success are made in America.Their only goals are in the South and East China Sea. ,WarshipPorn,cou9c3f,1,t5_2tg3p

They were considered capital ships the same as battleships. The idea was that anything they couldnt outrun they could outgun and anything they couldnt outgun they could outrun.  The Alaska was more or less a scaled down version of the Iowa platform.  It wasnt designed to be a capital ship.They were originally conceived as responses to new heavy cruisers such as the German Deutschlandclass pocket battleships which were a similar idea scale down a battleship layout to cruiser size.  However the Alaskas were bigger and better armed.  They were designed to be cruiser killers capable of hunting down and outgunning the new posttreaty heavy cruisers.  However by the time they were put to sea most of the Japanese heavy cruisers they were meant to go toetotoe with had already been sunk.By WWII only the British still used the battlecruiser designation.

Now if you look at the fourth photo you can see the same two launch slots but using a little extra space you now have the ability to recover an aircraft. The fact that they could modify old designs shows how good an idea it was it didnt require a new class of ship.Its also safer as the landing aircraft can abort a landing and go back around without endangering any aircraft taking off which wouldnt be the case without the angled deck.,WarshipPorn,crhf3s4,3,t5_2tg3p

5034572,0,t3_3jvdxt,gtWhile participating in war game maneuvers in  the Fourth Fleet became caught in extremely foul weather. The weather continued to deteriorate and by  September had reached typhoon status. Two of the newer large Special Type destroyers the Hatsuyuki and the Yugiri had their bows torn away by the heavy seas. A number of recently built heavy cruisers also suffered significant structural damage. The Myoko the Mogami and the submarine tender Taigei developed serious cracks in their hulls and the light aircraftcarriers Hsh and Ryujo suffered damage to their flight decks and superstructure with the Ryujo also having her hangar section flooded. The minelayer Itsukushima suffered damage that required several months for extensive repairs necessitating a near complete rebuild. Nearly all the fleets destroyers suffered damage to their superstructures and fiftyfour crewmen were lost swept overboard or killed outright.gtThe Japanese Admiralty held a hearing on the damage suffered by Fourth Fleet in the storm resulting in recommendations for changes on Japanese warship design and construction. A number of new designs that used heavier guns and taller superstructures were found to be top heavy and efforts were made to stabilize these ships by reducing weight above the waterline. In addition cracks in the hulls of the new cruisers indicated the recently adopted practice of electric welding hull seams was suspect and the practice was canceled on all new Japanese warship construction.

6449114,0,t1_czm7hca,I will withdraw my suggestion that torpedoes managed to hit inboard of the torpedo bulkhead  that was based on a misunderstanding of where Bismarcks bilge keels were positioned and the layout of the torpedo bulkhead. Having looked further into it it does seem unlikely. However I remain unconvinced without further evidence that none of Rodneys or Dorsetshires torpedoes to starboard penetrated the torpedo bulkhead. It was designed to resist a lb warhead according to Browns Nelson to Vanguard and the lb warheads on the British torpedoes would have pushed it to its limits a view corroborated by the testimony of survivors. While it may have protected against Norfolks torpedo I dont feel theres enough evidence to generalise from this about its ability to protect against all the torpedoes that hit. However even if the torpedoes did penetrate the bulkhead the scale of flooding to port was so great that as you point out any counterflooding effect would likely have been minor.As to the degree of list this article claims that her main deck was nearly awash at . However it doesnt show the photos it describes leading me to be rather sceptical about it. This RN report based on prisoner testimony suggests that the flooding was bad enough to put two of the .in turrets on the port side out of action. Such flooding would likely have caused a notinsignificant degree of list. This must have occurred before  and quite possibly before  when the British claimed she was silenced. gtBefore we continue I must thank you for remaining rational during this discussion. I enjoy these discussions as I not only learn things I had not known or had forgotten but modify my point of view to better fit the evidence. I think that when we decide to end this we will both go away wiser and likely in agreement.Im in complete agreement here  its great to have discussions like this. ,WarshipPorn,czmdn6d,1,t5_2tg3p

I dont remember what plane it was but my stats teacher was a pilot for the army and he told a story of when the army had him and a squadron fly some new planes out to Korea via the Pacificwith a few stops and then pick up the old ones. The problem was that the old ones couldnt get across the Pacific so they had to go the other way around. Long story short after being held up by a civil war in Burma I think.I might be wrong with that but I know the war started a day before they were supposed to fly over it and being stuck in Greenland because of a fuel pump failure they made it in just over a month. So it could potentially be cheaper and safer to just through it on a floaty thingy and send it off than to give a couple of  somethings a government credit card and hoping the planes make it back. ,WarshipPorn,d3d3n8s,15,t5_2tg3p

Both of these had much heavier protection than the Atlantic convoys  from surface escorts minefields and aircraft. This would likely account for the lower risk of attack run by uncamouflaged ships.

11257038,0,t1_df7yjv5,There have been other ships that have been sold but lost on the way toward scrapping. Did you know that such ships are actually insured often for more than the value of the ship scrap value of the metals itself? And if you accidentally loose a ship in such a way in water that could be as much as  miles deep no one can prove if it was accidental or deliberate so money is paid. In the case of the Oklahoma it sank because of a storm and I believe it was Navy Tugs bringing her to the west coast. Being sold doesnt mean it is scrapped. Being cut to pieces is. ,WarshipPorn,df7yval,1,t5_2tg3p

Despite Columbus being the first yeah I know about the vikings and their voyage traditionally Columbus is named first because his travel had effective political and historical consequences I think Vespucci was among the first to undestand that the whole land was a continent and not just the other side of Indias. He explored a lot of the South America under the Spanish crown. By the way it is not known if him was the first European to set foot on the American mainland still not considering vikings in fact an other Italian Giovanni Caboto arrived in Nova Scotia the same day June  .,WarshipPorn,dg9q2hx,2,t5_2tg3p
