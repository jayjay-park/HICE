6026937,0,t3_3xeed2,Im sure that the Democratic party and the campaign will both issue guides at some point but for the time being here is how the process works. On the night of the caucus you will need to show up at a particular location often a public school and sign in at the door. This process can take a while and if we have long lines like we did in  it can drag on for quite some time. Try to get there early so you are near the front of the line.At the registration table you will need a few things. If you are registered to vote and have joined the party then you will just need an id. You can identify yourself and they will look you up check you off and tell you where to go. Generally the caucus is organized with voters from different precincts at different tables but with big crowds it can be quite a jumble.If you are not registered to vote or not a member of the party you may register to vote on the spot and join the party and still be eligible to vote. That means you can invite friends who are not registered and they will still be allowed to participate.Once you are at the designated area for your precinct a few things will happen. First you will get to vote for in the Presidential preference poll. But thats not the only thing that happens at the caucus. As a precinct you will also be voting on delegates to the state convention and on precinct officers. I cant recommend it strongly enough  if we really want a revolution in American politics we need to participate in this part of the process as well.Running as a delegate is as simple as saying I want to be a delegate for Bernie Sanders. Some precincts will handle this a bit differently but its often the case that youll give a  second introduction to say why you would be good. The correct answer is Ive been volunteering a lot and registering people to vote. Ive made a lot of phone calls for the campaign etc. As a delegate it will be your responsibility to go the state convention which is where a lot of the Democratic party business transpires and also where delegates are elected for the national convention. We need to send as many Sanders delegates and alternates as possible to the State convention to make sure that there are no procedural shenanigans to benefit opposing campaigns. The DPH is really notorious for this but it wont happen if we have the numbers.Running as a precinct officer seems like kind of a waste of time but is also important. Precinct officers generally do very little but there are circumstances when it is good for us to have those spots. One is when a state representative or senator resigns the vacancy is filled by the Governor who must choose one of three options suggested by a panel made up of district and precinct leadership. One reason you may want to show up early is that in  with it such a madhouse people were cycling in and out of the hall so there was never a meeting of the complete caucus at once. A person at the beginning of the evening might put their name in as a delegate and as people came through they would get votes. But if one of the last people to the caucus wanted to be a delegate most of the precinct would have already voted. So get there early and stay the whole time.The final thing to say about the caucus is that your precinct is made up of your neighbors. There may be Clinton people there and conceivably an OMalley supporter or two. But please keep in mind that we will all be on the same side come November. So take the time to meet and talk with your fellow Democrats. You will also have a number of elected officials in attendance so make sure you say hello. ,HawaiiForSanders,cy9ni2l,2,t5_3818x
