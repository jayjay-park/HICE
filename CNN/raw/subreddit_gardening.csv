Same with starting small. If the yard is naked. concentrate first of the trees you want to put in. Think about leaf and fruit litter disease and so forth.

You go and get some soil tests done come back with some results and then Ill be happy to tell you how to fix it.  gtThere are wonderful upsides to green manures but several downsides as well to which not everyone is suited. The only downside to green manures is that of time. Impatient people dont have time for it. Even a single pass would take only  weeks but youd have to wait for spring to do it and Im assuming due to your repeatedly coming back here and asking me for shopping lists that youre in  a hurry and arent interested in waiting until spring and then spending even  weeks with buckwheat.gtWhat would be some good alternatives to using green manures that can be used to fertilize the land? First you need to know what it needs. Then you start adding things.You should really do some basic reading on gardening.

I would then repot into a clay pot using either a succulent soil mixture or a regular mixture heavily cut with perlite. I would only water this plant once week getting the soil nice and wet without leaving any standing water in the dish beneath the pot while leaving it in a spot that gets partial sunlight or strong indirect sunlight.

160332,0,t3_1vunax,Hello there! What a nice little space you have Im sure it will look wonderful when youre through with it. I want to strongly encourage you to do a bit of research on native plants plants which naturally grow in your region which will do very well in your yard. This means less work for you because the plants are predisposed to like your area and also a little ecosystem that your local fauna can kick around in which they will much appreciate maybe a butterfly garden?. Since you are going to be spending time and money on this patch as well as using precious fresh water irrigating it its ideal if you can get something out of it beside pure aesthetics. Those rocks should go you can use them elsewhere in the yard maybe a rock lined path? and then you can check out the soil. A nice layer of compost and some tilling wouldnt hurt to get the space aerated and ready for life. Once youre ready to plant there is no doubt some local nursery which specializes in natives. You would be surprised at all of the beautiful exotic unique and colorful varieties available which dont have that I just bought this zombie plant from Home Depot look and which will do well in your soil and climate. I strongly recommend a succulent area because thats a great way to get lots of color and growth with very little water input. You can also take cuttings from your succulents and place them elsewhere to sprout a new plant! Mexican sage is gorgeous and colorful. A couple dahlias and sunflowers in the back would give you some great height and color. All of this is easy to take care of once its in the ground the plants will let you know when they want to be watered probably every couple of days. Just google your city butterfly garden to learn more about how to pick a few plants which will attract bugs and birds. Smaller plants are always cheapest but if they like the spot they will grow quickly to fill it out. Good luck!,gardening,cewp100,1,t5_2qhkh

166518,0,t3_1vzkv1,The biggest reason why community gardens fail is that nobody wants to go out there in July and pull weeds. Commitment is what works.  Lack of commitment when people drift away as the summer wears on is what fails.Question Is this going to be a community garden open to anyone? Or is it going to be only for church members? If B then its  a communal garden which is slightly different.  If its a private communal garden then you have the right to say who may and may not participate and you dont necessarily have to open it up to anyone and everyone.This is a factor because of insurance. All community gardens need to have insurance that covers injuries and death on their property and in order to obtain insurance the garden needs a legally incorporated official chain of commandpresident treasurer etc with an official bank account. This is because insurance companies dont write policies for loosely organized ad hoc groups of some folks who want to start a garden.If youre doing this on church property under the official auspices of the church most likely the churchs insurance carrier will be able to add the appropriate coverage.A diagram of your proposed land space and the buildings would be helpful.Are you thinking of raised beds or halfbarrels? What is your soil like?The  consideration is going to be water. Youre going to want easy access to watering.The  consideration is going to be whos going to do the gruntwork. As an elderly person myself I too think it would be splendid if my church used some of their extra land to build me a gardenbut not if I have to do the tilling and spading myself.The  consideration is if youre doing raised beds or containers whos going to pay for the potting mix to put into them? You dont use ordinary backyard garden dirt for those.,gardening,cexee2r,3,t5_2qhkh

And this is a good time of the year for you to prune but like grandmagos said you should probably wait due to the drought. One thing you could do to help out the rose is to remove all of the weeds undernear the rose. Theyre stealing all the water and nutrients and you dont have any water you spare at this point. Also add a nice layer of mulch around the rose but away from the trunk to help conserve whatever water you give it. ,gardening,cf41gk7,2,t5_2qhkh

I think your target customer is a beginner without the time tools or know how to build one themselves. I also think that type of customer is probably not going to want to spend the kind of money you need to price it at in order to be profitable so my advice would be to figure out how to make it cheaper which would get the price down.  I build these boxes with slightly different materials using xs admittedly not cedar but a lot more solid for about  including the dirt.  If I were to sell it at  Id have a markup of  if my math is right and I believe a price point more palatable for a beginner. Your other target market might be customers with the right disposable income but the same lack of time and know how.

483215,0,t3_1zn8y7,gtWhats the difference between garden soil top soil potted soil peat moss and compost? First what is top soil. Topsoil is the top layer of dirt on the Earth. It is the top living layer of soil with a bustling ecology full of earthworms pillbugs ants whole hosts and myriads of microorganisms. Its alive it has air spaces in between the mixture of clay silt and organic matter that composes it and usually its really fertile. This makes it what plants grow in. Its usually anywhere from  to  deep depending on geography. Good black dirt topsoil is not normally for sale anywhere for love or money because A its busy holding up your lawn and B gardeners who have it hoard it. They dont bag it up and sell it because then they wouldnt have it anymore.Under the topsoil is subsoil. This is usually clay it is relatively impermeable to water and is what builders excavate down to when building a house.  It is too full of clay to be any use in a garden might as well use concrete.When a developer builds a subdivision or a shopping center he sometimes has his bulldozers scrape off the precious layer of topsoil which he then trucks across town and sells to a garden center somewhere as topsoil because legally that is what it is.  The bulldozers not being precision instruments also scrape up a lot of subsoil along with it. So topsoil that you purchase from a garden center can be genuine topsoil or it can be subsoil or it can be a mixture of the two.Garden soil means dirt.  If its not in a big plastic bag or being delivered by somebody with a big truck which Ill get to in a minute then garden soil in gardening talk means ordinary backyard dirt native dirt the stuff you see in your yard when you look out your kitchen window. Its probably holding up some lawn grass a BBQ grill and a childs swingset also maybe some garbage cans. If you plant things in it it changes from dirt into garden soil as in That spot by the garage was just a dirt patch last year but now its my garden.  If its in a big plastic bag labeled garden soil at Home Depot or the landscape center or if its being delivered to your home by someone named Jack or Bob with a big truck then there is literally no telling what it could be. It could be topsoil or subsoil or a mix of the two or it could be any substance that someone wanted to label as garden soilcomposted tree bark blends of peat moss and other things who knows. People have opened up bags of garden soil to find it full of pieces of plastic tree bark and other random crap. If you buy bulk garden soil from someone get a look at it before you order it.Garden soil is not good for containers or raised beds because the inevitable clay component even good topsoil has clay and silt in it makes it drain slowly which is not what you want in a container. So garden soil and topsoil are not used in containers or raised beds.  Potting soil potting mix is whats used.Potting soil is not soil or dirt. It is an artificial mix especially for containers pots and usually has a large percentage of peat moss andor composted tree bark. Sometimes its flatout  peat moss or sometimes coir dust coco peat. Peat moss means Canadian peat moss harvested from peat bogs in Canada. It is a nonsustainable resource similar to petroleum which Mother Nature also isnt making any more of.  It is completely nutrientfree retains moisture very well and is merely an anchor for roots. Coir dust coco peat is the new sustainable replacement for peat moss.Compost is the magic.  When organic material rots down it rots down into fragrant crumbly brown stuff that when added to soil improves soil texture increases its waterholding ability increases the air spaces between soil particles to benefit roots attracts earthworms and other beneficials that eat it. There is literally no downside to compost. You cant add too much compost to your garden. Compost is what makes the whole thing go.Thanks to the miracle of First World life it is sometimes possible to get free compost from your municipality who hand it out courtesy of citywide composting programs. If you live in such a place bend the knee and bow low in thanks to the small gods of gardening.gt. Is compost organic material that has been broken down into nutrients for plants and veggies that can be used in place of fertilizers. Do I still need other nutrients to feed the plants that compost cannot deliver other than sun and water smart guys? Compost is generally nutritionally complete but it depends on what youre putting into it. Its still possible for plants to suffer things like blossom end rot from lack of calcium. So while compost is magic its not necessarily the only solution. You have to let your plants tell you what they need. Also it never hurts to add other things like bone meal blood meal kelp meal composted steer manure other manures etc.  The more organic ingredients you can toss in the more varied the supply of nutrients and the less likely you are to run up against some weird nutrient defiency in the middle of July.gt. Can compost be used by itself as a potted soil or is it too dense? Will I need to add things like perilite rocks sand for drainage? It is too dense for potting soil. It needs to be lightened with perlite vermiculite sand things like that.Dont put rocks gravel or sand in the bottom of containers for drainage it leads to pooling of water on the interface between the rocks and the soil.gtWhat Im trying to achieve is little to nothing to pay for as far as soil is concerned. I want to make my own soil put Im having a hard time figuring out what a potted garden needs and how to feed the plants. Free soil  make compost.  If youre in a place where you just cant afford perlite or other soil additives you can make do with compost and sand for your potting mix.Feeding plants in containers is different from feeding plants in the ground. This is because containers dont always have the complete array of soil organisms that are what help to break down the nutrients in organic materials and make them available to plants. If your plants are living in sterile peat mossbased potting mix and you add compost on top of that as topdressing there is nobody at home to break down the nutrients in the compost. If your potted plants are growing in sterile artificial potting mix you use chemical fertilizers such as MiracleGro. Or else you study up on organic gardening and figure out how to have your potted plants growing in organic mix i.e. compost and sand.So there are choices to be made.  Organic or artificial. Both have pros and cons Im not going to tell you which one is better. I do artificial indoors orchids African violets seed starting and organic outdoors.,gardening,cfv70x7,3,t5_2qhkh

It also likes bright light but not direct sunlight.You should let the plant dry out between watering and when you do water you should apply enough water so that it can run out of the drain hole to flush out any accumulating salts in the medium. If its potted in miracle grow mix thats made up mostly of peat moss it can be difficult to rehydrate the medium after it dries out so you might have to soak the entire pot in a tub of water for  minutes. I usually find that using home made potting medium works better than any commercially available mix. I would recommend a mix of a calcined clay like Turface finely chopped pine bark grit and a slow release fertilizer like Osmocote.As for liquid fertilizers  fertilizer works well when diluted to lt the recommended concentration and applied every time you water with the medium I describe above indoor plants in  pots get watered every  weeks.The above watering and feeding instructions work very well for most plants.

I guess it depends on the plant. If I did containers it would make it easier to bring the plants with me when I move. Eventually Id like them to be in the ground though. ,gardening,cghqqkp,1,t5_2qhkh

I have no idea where you live but here in the summer your grass can go about  weeks with minimal rain and turn brown and still be alive. However after that point we have to start watering once a week or the entire lawn will die.If you search your state university extension they should have a ton of information about lawn care for your specific area.

But cucurbs cucumber melon squash dont really like cold so wait until after last frost. Tomatoes are the same as are beans and most of the cabbage family.

989290,0,t3_25f7of,Do you know what variety you bought? You can look it up by name and find reviews of how heavy a producer it is.  Last year I had a really fruitful hybrid bush variety growing in a container that was giving me around  inch cukes per week at its peak. I was making  jars of pickles per week and I continued to harvest until the end of the season. The cukes grew to  inches in only a few days. I helped the production along by handpollinating not necessary but I think it helped during times when I had a lot of female but only a couple male blossoms. Conversely my mom had a plant in the ground that produced only a few all summer. You might want to net your plant.

The soil should stay moist at all times but not soggy.  You can put mulch in the pots to help with keep the soil damp and put trays underneath to help with it leaking out.

1026575,0,t3_25pa0b,Youd basically be a landscaping contractor specializing in veggie gardens. There is a potential for making some cash but you probably wont earn much in the beginning. In fact you might lose a little off of your first few clients but it will help you get your name out.  If I were you Id set up a consultation with the client. There you could judge what they wantneed and you could see what is possible given their space time and sun exposure. Your clients will be paying for your expertise I.e. you dont pay a mechanic to turn a wrench you pay him to know what bolt to tighten. Your pricing should be similar a flat hourly rate plus expenses plants dirtwood irrigation tools etc. If you have expensive equipment like a tiller or front loader you can add some of that cost to your expenses Youll be able to charge to install the garden and plants and you can make some residual income charging for maintenance like a lawn care service does.  If the client doesnt have a lot of time you can sell an automatic watering package and install timers to water at certain intervals for an extra xxx.  Your clients will likely be more affluent people upper middle class and above.  I dont know much about Aus but if I were doing this in the US Id go to a local organic market or farmers market and pass out fliers those customers will likely be your clients and youll be able to spread the word about your business pretty easily. Youll have a broader customer base if you do other types of gardening as well and maybe you could learn how to install otger types of raised beds like stone. You could partner with a stone mason and give them referrals and vice versa.  Most of your money will be made in the spring and summer but you could builddesign backyard greenhouses to extend your season in the fall and you can sell  your summer clients a fall garden package  for lettuces greens carrots radishes etc. a winterearly start spring package.   If youre already gardening at home maybe you could start some seeds and offer a planting package for your clients for each season.  Making money off of your clients will be easier than finding new ones just make sure you give them great service and dont try to gouge them off the bat.  Make sure you take before and after photos and make a portfolio of your clients and add it to a website. If you dont know how to make a website there are contractors for that ,gardening,chkz7mr,2,t5_2qhkh

Use a x to screedlevel larger areas. Level is key. . A water filled roller is next. It helps to GENTLY compact your ground work. Try not to walk on your finished soil work. They can rented at Home Depot for cheap. . Place sod. Literally. Thats it. Cut to shape. Place sod. . Water sod. A good soaking. . Use the roller again. This will help the soda underside come into contact with your groundwork. . Stay away from fertilizers for a week or two. It won destroy anything if you do. However the roots really need time to set. Adding fertilizer slows root growth and speeds up leaf growth. . Water heavily for  days. Like twice a day for  hour each time. If the patch is smaller then water until soaked. . After the initial set in period you can fertilize. I use a general lawn fertilizer along with a liquid revive product. I offset my applications to reduce problems. . The first month or two let the sod grow. If you must trim use the highest ground clearance setting on your mower. Only trim small bits off at a time. Dont try to mow it all down a t once. . Now water and mow as needed on a regular basis. Fertilize before winter and in the onset of spring with a winterized fertilizer. For mid summer use a normal or organic fertilizer. . Mow clippings your mower may have a setting for putting your clippings in a bag or just throwing back on the lawn. Most times use the bag setting. In spring and mid summer use the mulching non bag setting. Mow during the late morning to late afternoon. Dont mow early morning or night with the mulch setting as the grass clippings and watermorning dew will encourage fungal growth and disease. Tip water before sunrise and after sunset. Mow during daylight. . A cheap way to get your grass to turn super dark green is to use a high iron supplement or even iron filings. The plants will use the iron and its decay products to turn super dark green. Down side is it also speeds up potash calcium nitrogen usage. So if you go this route be prepared to add extra fertilizer or organic supplements.. About every year or two have a service come in and aerate and thatch your lawn. As your sodlawn grows the undergrowth cannot receive water and sunlight as when it was younger due to over growth. Aeration adds pockets in your lawn to give water air and fertilizerscompost a place to reach undergrowth and roots. Thatching works similarly but focuses more on combing out dead undergrowth to similar results. It is possible to do both of these buy hand. But its hard. And darn near impossible if your lawn is of a decent size. Its easier to hire a pro for aeration and thatching. ,gardening,chnkw7w,1,t5_2qhkh

The lack of sufficient light is a dealbreaker for growing corn. No matter what kind of soil pot and fertilizer you give them if they arent getting the requisite amount of daily solar energy they just cant do it.  You see the same thing when you plant corn in the shade of trees or buildings.I dont think that corn is suited to grow on your shady balcony and Id urge you to grow things that will be happier there such as greens lettuces herbs and possibly some root veg like carrots. I hate to see you investing a lot of time money energy and love on this when the chances of any kind of harvest are rather remote.If you are determined to try then use a balanced fertilizer that says complete or with micronutrients on the label. And dont mix it into the soil because granular tomato food is for planting inground where you have natural processes to break down the granules. Use watersoluble fertilizer. Also if you mix granular in their soil you basically cant fertilize them again for  to  months depending on the brand so if the granules arent breaking down your hands are tied from adding more from the top.,gardening,chy1ue5,2,t5_2qhkh

My husband is a chemical engineer so when he looked at the process and the chemicals involved and gave them his stamp of approval it gave me peace of mind. If you look at the older studies from when wood was treated with arsenic they found that most of the time levels of arsenic actually taken into the plant were pretty low and that the plants most effected were the ones  or closer to the edges of the beds.With that being said if youre uncomfortable I would use cedar or something else. But I wouldnt discourage somebody from building a garden out of the new pressure treated wood if thats what they can afford.

1251965,0,t3_28flef,Youll find varying opinions and lots of debate over this. In my opinion its largely a myth. The idea is that the suckers divert energy from the plant that could go to fruit on the main branches. Its usefulness depends on your specific situation.  Generally dont do it on determinate tomatoes. These produce their fruit almost all at once and will usually naturally limit themselves in size and branch number. If youre growing in containers it makes sense. Limited room for roots will result in better fruit if you keep the top growth balanced in proportion. It also creates a better structure which may be useful because staking or caging can be more difficult or limited in containers.  If you have a particularly short growing season either because it doesnt get warm early enough or gets too hot too soon which stops tomato production it may make sense. You can theoretically force a smaller number of fruits to form and ripen earlier.  If you have issues with staking  caging  trellising and need limited branches and a stronger structure pruning suckers might help. But its actually less work to invest in a good support system. Pruning off suckers and branches at the bottom can help with disease control by minimizing splash back of spores from the soil. Similarly pruning suckers above can create a more open structure with better air circulation which can also help with disease. It also makes it easier to apply fungicides. Overall if youre growing in the ground and have a good support system and have an average growing season pruning suckers is probably counterproductive. Suckers do produce tomatoes just later on. They do not steal energy from the plant  theyre photosynthetic factories. As long as you provide the fertility and water to the roots to support them suckers will produce fruit. ,gardening,ciagmes,6,t5_2qhkh

Im working on Bringing Nature Home now.As far as gardening goes I think the most useful are Teaming with Nutrients and Teaming with Microbes which I have as an ebook. I refer to them constantly. Theyve all been really useful though. It depends upon what you want to learn about.I also have about  textbooks on botany geology soil science entomology and ecology that I havent even started on yet.Ive often thought a book swap would be a good idea but I think a lot of people would hate to lose their books especially if theyre highlighted and annotated.

1390035,0,t3_2a07on,I and a friend here in NYC have similar set ups mine is smaller and I would recommend looking into what we both did installed automatic drip systems. You get a timer that attaches to the hose and then a halfinch tube that goes all the way around the patio. You stick little quarter inch tubes with a drip head into the bigger tube  one for each plant. Then you tell the timer to turn the water on however you like once a day twice a day three times a day. And you can tell it how long to stay on. The biggest expense was the timer which I think I got for about  bucks. The tubing and drip kits can be had for very cheap all over the Internet. I found one deal last year that had whole sets with enough gear for a whole patio going for about four bucks. Its both a pain and kind of fun  like a puzzle game  to set up the first time.

1419766,0,t3_2ae2vc,It is awesome that you have such a large variety! I must say that your seedlings need some more light  when they get very tall like that with white stems they need light and perhaps less water. Also roots arent the happiest when started anywhere besides where they will be grown. For the best luck with root crops carrots radishes beets etc. plant them right into the earth where they will live.Before planting outdoors harden off your seedlings. Place them outdoors during the day for a short time few hours gradually increasing their time outdoors by a couple hours until they spend the night out there takes about a week. This hardens up their stalks makes them much stronger and better allows them to be transplanted without any shock or loss.Sorry if I came off like a downer  I really think youre heading in the right direction.

Cabbage moths arent super severe in our area but do cause mild to moderate problems for our brassicas.  What I do is visually inspect the plants frequently and if I see newlooking bites I carefully check over the whole plant.  When I find the caterpillar I kill it on sight.  I also am always on the lookout for suspiciously folded over leaves or leaves that look like theyre glued to each other.  Leaving lots of room between plants seems to help as well  brussels sprouts benefit from the ventilation anyway.  In some areas people have to set up netting around their brassicas.

1508791,0,t3_2bgmzu,Its not a bonsai its an ordinary houseplant a Schleffera. It needs bright indirect light and probably needs to be repotted as thats most likely pure peat moss that its living in. Get some bagged houseplant potting soil at Walmart and some vermiculite. Mix these  soil to vermiculite. Get a  plastic plant pot or use a  oz yogurt container with holes punched in the bottom.Slide the plant out of the Lowes pot put a small handful of the potting mix in the bottom of the new pot and set the root ball on top of the pile of potting mix. You want the eventual top of the soil level to be at the same place it was beforei.e. you dont want to bury the plant deeper than it originally was nor do you want to have it higher than before.  Fill in around the root ball with potting mix and tap the pot lightly on the table to settle it.  Water gently around it until water comes out the bottom hole.Allow it to drain then put it in bright but indirect light. No direct hot sun.  Underneath ranks of standard office fluorescents is fine. Put it up high if you can so its closer to the lights as opposed to down low by the floor.Water it only when the top of the soil feels dry to the touch.In a month give it a dose of any watersoluble fertilizer for houseplants mixed according to the label.,gardening,cj5ehp5,2,t5_2qhkh

1661884,0,t3_2ddz27,So first off nearly all of these plants are annuals so youll have to replant them next spring.  Annuals naturally die off every year and some like tomatoes and peppers are grown as annuals because theyre so sensitive to cold they cant survive the winter in most of the world.  Of whats in your pictures only the raspberries and possibly the kale depending how old it is kale is a biennial meaning it lives two years will come back next spring.Your onions look overwatered.  Cut back on the watering but dont stop entirely as onions cant handle much dryness.It looks like your squash has powdery mildew.  Its not fatal but it stresses the plant and it can spread.  You can apply a fungicide or a home remedy but someone else will have to help you there as I havent dealt with it myself.A lot of the wilting youre seeing looks like its on the lower leaves which I wouldnt worry about.

Beans produced but were never harvested.  Carrots were left in too long but really shouldnt have been in such a shallow planter anyways but i was going to put in peppers in their place which was never done.  Broccolli had issues with beetles. Garlic was thought to be onions so they were both pulled mid July because who knows why....  The tomatoes are doing very well though a total of  plants that are each producing fruit.  Same with the peppers  plants all producing at least two peppers.

This will show them the tremendously fun benefits of alcohol  capsaicin! Ask if any kids have any pet rats mice or hamsters. If any do tell them to bring the pet to a show and tell the next day.

You need intense light to get nice stocky plants and THO will do that for you.  That picture is slightly misleading though because you can figure that youre only going to have maximum growth within the footprint of the light itself and maybe  on either side.  If you put your garden in a grow tent with reflective sides you can help increase the utilization of your light.Youll want to pair your light with a nice hydro system to get the best results.  If you want to grow lettuce NFT ebb amp flow and even aeroponic systems will work.  You could also grow them in containers with coir cocopeat as the growing medium.  Stay away from peat moss.  Clay stones etc. work well too.Just about any food out there will grow lettuce without trouble.

2135232,0,t3_2jexzp,Do yourself a favor and start collecting rain water. Its ideal for watering citrus.Second make sure you are watering properly and that you have a free draining soil. Peat based soils usually hold too much moisture and do not allow enough oxygen to get to the roots. Citrus are pretty sensitive about this. Bark based mixes are best particularly in the ratio of  parts pine or fir bark  part perlite  part peat moss. Dont wait for the soil to become bone dry before rewatering. Use a wooden skewer or chopstick and poke it down into the soil. If it comes out moist after a few minutes wait another day and check again.Third citrus are heavy feeders. Get yourself some DynaGro Foliage Pro fertilizer and fertilize it lightly with every other watering.When moving indoors for the winter provide some supplemental light. I use a couple  watt CFL bulbs in a reflector. Works fairly well.,gardening,clb8gow,1,t5_2qhkh

2688348,0,t3_2qtatl,This advice is not hugely specific to your area its more as one beginner to another. Im two years ahead of you on learning what to do Ive found tomatoes can be a bit of a learning curve. It will probably take a season or two before you really figure out which variety you want and how to look after them. Get some sort of automatic or semiautomatic watering system or youll get sick of watering very quickly and find a youtube video on how to prune them. Cucumbers are like tomatoes maybe a bit easier to deal with. You need to support the branches even more than with toms.I consider onions and leeks to be bombproof winter crops. We grow them to make use of ground that otherwise would be empty in winter. They work in summer too of course!Strawberries are very easy but will need protection from animals that want to eat them. You can put them in pots easily enough they dont have to go in the ground. Youll need a lot of plants to get much from them though.Peppers are actually pretty easy to grow as well definitely worth having a few plants going.Trees like apple and peaches will take a couple of years to be productive so get them in this spring if youre going to stay where you are for a while.Anything soft and green and brassicalike is going to attract bugs to munch on it. Personally I cant be bothered fighting the bugs so I just dont grow them. Potatoes are too cheap to buy and we dont have the space to grow anything like what we would need so again I dont bother.I would always recommend starting with herbs they are dead simple to grow and very useful. Get a basic kitchen herb garden going as your first priority and you can use it every day of the week. Rosemary thyme mint sage... figure out what you use and grow it.

Some will work out fine others will fail. About those that fail try to find out why they failed for example by taking a photo and posting a question here. Making your own seedlings is a wholly different topic and warrants an extra year to learn about. Buy all herbs pregrown most herbs hard to grow from seeds especially if your climate is not mediterranean.Learn about soil composition and basic fertilization yes even if you want to go organic ideally from a current general gardening book that you can buy in a local bookstore and start a compost NOW by starting to pile scraps into a heap.Good luck!,gardening,cngv7jh,2,t5_2qhkh

I keep my compost in a black bin like this oneFirst my experience has been that its impossible to keep the compost in a bin like that warm through the winter here. Its going to freeze no matter what. However the freezethaw cycle helps break up the compost so that when spring hits whatever you threw on the pile over the winter very quickly turns to soil.Second Ive found its useful to have two bins. Last winter I had just one but then in the spring I had a dilemma... I wanted to keep throwing our kitchen scraps on the pile but that meant mixing uncomposted material with the stuff that had spent the winter frozen. Because its a bit tricky to remove compost material from those bins I wound up with a few uncomposted bits in my garden.

We live on a small income so cant afford fresh berries ever. Ive recently started blueberries raspberries blackberries boysenberries and blackcurrants. Next year well have our first berries from them. All very easy to grow but blueberries need  different varieties for pollination.Rhubarb is great too if you have some space and best if you have access to horse  sheep  chicken poo as rhubarb needs a lot of food. But it is so easy. Just buy a small plant from the garden store plant feed and water. Once it gets big maybe the year or two after you can dig it up it has a massive massive root that will have a few plants growing from it.

The overhead fan and natural wind help to harden them off. Gradually I give them more and more light over the course of a week before actually planting them.,gardening,coyaesl,3,t5_2qhkh

You chop them back after harvest leaving the new growth that happens about the same time as the berries for next years production. You would think that something like landscape fabric would be a problem but Ive had them grow up through landscape fabric  inches of gravel and ftft from the original plant. Blackberries are very hardy plants if you are concerned just leave them in the gallon nursery pot for a while.

And because they grow so fast when the soil is warm its not quicker to get them started indoors. Basil in particular will just sit there and sulk and possibly rot unless the soil temps are very warm.

When I prepared my beds the first time I would sift through the soil by hand going after these roots while turning the soil.The roots go up to m deep. They grow in nitrogen rich compacted soil. This has an ecological consequence The deep roots will bring back buried nutrients back to the soil where weeded horsetails may be composted and the nutrients returned back into the cycle. The other consequence is as you uncompact your soil and make it fluffier they will become less and less of a problem. But they are there to stay the roots go under pavements lawns fences etc. where they cant be removed from and will regrow from there.The german internet claims horsetail tea is useful as a plant strengthener and is said to help against fungal disease. Put the green parts  they will follow shortly after the flowers that you see in your picture  into a large pot fill it with water and let sit for  hours. Cook it and let it simmer for  minutes. The cooled tea should be used  diluted spraying or watering the plants. Silica is said to be the active ingredient.Well  happy weeding!,gardening,cqpfvpx,5,t5_2qhkh

I realized my stupidity of not lining with hardware cloth until after it was too late. My pathways were already covered in decomposed granite but I got ambitious one weekend and decided to dig out one of the beds and line it with the hardware cloth. I put down a tarp for the dirt and another and another. Needless to say my eyes were bigger than my stomach and I ended up only lining one of the beds. Now the redwood is rotting on all of them and without removing all that dirt I still cant replace them with hardware cloth liners which will eventually rust also but not before AQC pressure treated uh I dont really know this to be trueI havent priced lumber recently but if I decide to replace the wood I would with no question use premium kilndried AQC.

You could conceivably do something like a Danvers Half Long in .  When a carrot meets an obstruction like a bigish rock or packed soil they split.

Its almost winter here Australia and unfortunately this is my first year of gardening so I made some pretty amateur mistakes. The bugs took over many of my leaves and my beds are overcrowded. Also the plants nearly died since I went on holidays twice... this not only killed them the white spots took over. That said Im glad that most of my crops survived on a balcony... cant wait to start prepping for next year!    Taste... the sauce is still cooking so Ill get back to you on that one. The Peter Pepper chillies WERE very hot. Ive left them on the tree a lot so theyre now only mildly hot. The MASSIVE red ones different type I forget the name are essentially capsicums now. I tried them when they were younger and they were hot. Now I literally chop them up and put them into salads raw... there is no heat.    Any tips for next year? My plan for next year is   Plant less and focus on the quality of the individual plants rather than overcrowding.   Water less often so that the chillies dont become capsicums.   Use my white oil and organic fungus killer earlier. I let the pests run amok this year and it really spoiled my garden.

I like to place mint somewhere that stays moist and is not in the way as it aggressively spreads. I usually plant around water faucets or rain barrels and near the base of fruit trees as mint is a nutrient accumulator. Parsley has a long tap root and often does not like to be transplanted. Most likely it will bolt flower and go to seed after you transplant it. Dont worry about it just let it seed and next year you will have more parsley than you know what to do with.

There is a pretty decent sized garden in the back yard with a couple plants up front. One roommate has been watering barely giving  of the area a little shower sometimes daily. There are a lot of overgrowth and I know that there is a lot of work that needs to be done. Since there is such potential for this garden I am excited to get my hands dirty. No pun intended.  But I am not quite sure where to begin. To name a few issues that I already see includeThe basil has flowered and produced small bitter unodorous leaves. The blueberries were underwatered and not picked so they  shriveled up. The chives are very fibrous and have harder stalks. They also do not taste great either. The rhubarb in front are not at all red just green. I had rhubarb while growing up and my plants never looked as these do.The pictures are of almost all of the plants. I know what a decent amount of things are but some plants I have no idea. Any tips and suggestions for where I should start are highly appreciated! Thank you. ,gardening,csv8f9i,2,t5_2qhkh

It adds organic matter to the soil and utilizes the soil during a blank period when not much else is going on if youre not doing fallwinter crops.  What you plant depends on where you are and how long you want to dedicate your garden to cover crops. You can do a quickie autumn grow of nonwinterhardy fastmaturing buckwheat or annual rye or else something like winter rye that you leave in place all spring.Cover crops and green manures are a fantastic way to add organic matter to your soil.,gardening,ctb57y3,3,t5_2qhkh

4706997,0,t3_3fdaeq,Youll be fine! A few tips I have learnedYou can mix up your own potting mix to save money. Look up recipes  e.g. last time I used a mix of coconut coir like peat vermiculite can otherwise use perlite sand etc and well rotted compost then added some crusher dust composted manure etc. Saves me a lot in potting mix and easy to customise depending on what Im planting e.g. fruiting vegetables do better with lots of manure as opposed to root vegetables.Pots dry out really quickly. Its much easier to grow things in the ground so you dont have to constantly water them.Different seeds germinate at different temperatures. Check the when to plant what guides as they relate to soil temperature.Ive grown rhubarb from seed successfully by the way. No special care required. I am still a beginner too so all of the above may be taken with a grain of salt! Constant failures here too. Eg spent a long time looking for a white adriatic fig plant because apparently they are delicious. Ordered it ahead paid an arm and a leg for it then didnt water it for a few days and it just shrivelled up and died. There was no bringing it back.Just the other day I got a bare root rose and left it soaking in a bucket of water for  days to rehydrate because you arent meant to let the roots dry out. Well I forgot about evaporation. When I went back to it it was bone dry and in the hot sun. Oops. Topped up the water and will try to plant tomorrow.,gardening,ctnus53,1,t5_2qhkh

4718654,0,t1_ctp891g,Pruning unnecessary plant growth will help focus energy on fruit growth but only minimally in most cases especially if your plant is relatively small. The worldclass giant pumpkin growers maintain plants in excess of  square feet and end up cutting off thousands of flowers tendrils and thirdtier vines. At that scale it makes a difference... for the backyard grower having his or her first go at it I dont think its a huge concern. That said cucumber beetles and some other destructive pests are particularly attracted to the blossoms so if you have insect issues it might be worth snipping flowers before they open. As for maximizing growth just keep the plant wellwatered and the pumpkin shaded to prevent its skin from maturing too quickly and form some kind of feeding schedule. Ideally youd soak the plant with a balanced or somewhat potassiumheavy watersoluble fertilizer once or twice weekly to maintain leaf health and steady pumpkin growth. Overall though weather is the great equalizer... sunny warm days and mild nights are key to good growth.  ,gardening,ctpbpfq,1,t5_2qhkh

5180075,0,t3_3lyfha,Uh oh!  Removing soil with a pickaxe does not sound good.  Is the soil incredibly dry?  Or is it hard clay?  Either way what youll want to do is amend the soil.  Get out all the juniper roots add  inches of compost and till or dig that into the soil.  Repeat.  Boxwoods have pretty shallow roots so youll not have to worry about getting the soil amended too deeply. The vegetable garden will be another matter entirely.   Plant the boxwoods according to directions.  Dig a hole about x the rootball size and add a  mixture of native soil and compost to fill in.  Plant the bulbs about  in front of the boxwoods to accommodate growth of the boxwoods and their roots.  If you have a lot of squirrels consider burying chicken mesh over the bulbs so they cant dig them up.  Bulbs look great their first month buy after that they wither off and its advisable to let the leaves die back naturally so they can feed the bulbs the resulting look is not too pretty.  Id think about planting a second flower in front of the bulbs.  You could do a perennial geranium now.  Or in the summer buy a nice annual like salvia or begonias or angelonia to plant in front of the bulbs.  These will flower all summer and add more color to the house.   ,gardening,cvae0c1,3,t5_2qhkh

I was all excited to be accepted into the program as an undergrad... until I got there and it was a whole room of very nice retired people who had just moved to my state and wanted to know more about gardening. It was all day once a week with no studying or exams. Volunteering is primarily sitting in the office waiting for the phone to ring. I did it one year and I was out. Within the hort industry the MG program is often looked upon with deep suspicion and general annoyance as in hearing I know you went to school for years to learn about this and its your vocation but my friend is a master gardener and SHE says that petunias are perennials and all chemicals are bad. The other thing is that Master Gardener is a proprietary term and youre not allowed to use it when you are not actively volunteering as in literally at that moment. We dont publicize that we have X number of MGs on staff but we do publicize the number of staff members who have completed specific industry certifications. Those have rigorous standardized exams that are proctored at conferences and events... they quantify a knowledge base and those folks can justifiably ask for higher salaries etc..

5679440,0,t3_3sv0yj,gtWhile landscaping can add significant value to a homeIt doesnt. Nor to its assessed value either.Every realtor out there will tell you that the yard and garden add absolutely nothing to your curb appeal.  As long as theyre kept tidy because a neglected yard implies that the house might have been neglected too there is nothing you can plant or build that will increase curb appeal or list price. Buyers dont look at the yard and garden because if theyre the yardandgarden sort they know that theyre going to change it all around anyway if they buy the house. And if theyre not the yardandgarden sort they dont care what it looks like as long as its not messy.All those lists of how to increase your curb appeal say not a single word about the yard and garden other than keep it tidy.  You can have a front yard that is solid plantains and dandelions and as long as you keep mowed short it wont affect your houses value at all nor will prospective buyers care if they even notice. The ones who know enough about it to notice Heh that front yards totally weeds will know how to fix it if they buy the house. The ones who dont know enough about it to notice that its actually weeds will simply notice that its green.Look at the other comments so far in this thread Everybodys basically saying It doesnt matter whats already there because Im going to change it all around anyway if I buy the house.

6276286,0,t1_cz2gfao,gtIm in Southern California where our climate is actually pretty similar to parts of Australia. We actually have a lot of Jacaranda trees around here which are native to Australia.Yeah okay but parts of Australia includes everything from snowcapped mountains to exposed limestone bedrock desert to Mediterranean coasts to rainforests to tropical monsoon floodlands etc.  Jacarandas are found around our temperate coastal regions where we put the four big cities basically. Your seeds are from the far north tropical end. So firstly Kakadu is a national park you have a Billy Goat Plum or Kakadu Plum from the region  nobody would call it just a Kakadu. To explain that climate Kakadu National Park is near the city of Darwin which averages F  days through the year with odd spikes to F and a long dry lasting half the year with practically no rain at all followed by a wet when theyll average more rain each month than L.A. gets all year also cyclones and other fun tropical things.So itll be a biggish tropical tree maybe ft tall. It isnt domesticated. It definitely wont handle frosts if you get them and possibly might not even like nights under F and seems evolved for regions with yearround hot days and seasonal heavy rain. It flowers in the late dry season ending roughly around the time heavy rains appear. Fruit ripens a few months later. So Im guessing the hard seed husk usually rots away just before the dry season arrives. A lot of our native plants seem very fussy to grow from seed. They might need to be triggered by the heat of a bushfire or floodwater or smokey soil or whatever. And then they take forever to sprout or have miserable germination rates or fall over dead if they smell phosphorus. Basically Im saying dont expect all your  seeds to germinate. Even the nurseries struggle sometimes. The retailers advice seems pretty good but Im only guessing really Ive never grown one. File down the seed husk so its thin  if you hit the inner white lining of the husk then great but if you keep going and hit green then youve gone too far and killed the embryo. Ive used sandpaper on other native seeds before but a rasp might be better here. Dont freeze it like that commenter tried Im pretty certain thatd only kill it. I would try experimenting with variations on filing it down around the centre of the seed down to the white inner layer and then nicking it with a sharp knife or hacksaw soak it overnight or for a few days halfsubmerged in water with the drop of peroxide then put it in seedstartingmix combined with vermiculite and try to keep it moist and humid and warm in a sunny spot maybe F all day and night indoors there now?. It should sprout in  months if its going to at all so be patient. It might be worth looking at using a heated germination mat but Ive never used one of those. Good luck ,gardening,cz31jyx,2,t5_2qhkh

I am zone  and when it came to looking at chicken coops we opted for a plastic one because it came with a  year warranty and it holds up better to the elements than wood.  BUT you could also do cinder blocks for your raised beds.  Which is still be more affordable and you can shape them anyway you want and you could get the height you want.

They are cucumbers squash and tomato. I kept them indoors by a south facing window and watered them about once a day. After just a couple of days they sprouted. Began moving them outside into direct sunlight when the weather was warm and they grew fast.But now over the past two or three days Ive noticed especially with the cucumbers that some of the leafs are starting to curl and even get a hint of yellow around the edges. One has completely wilted but it still has all of its color. From what I could gather maybe it was too cold?

Cut the smaller of the two stems cleanly with shears and pull the vine out. Replanting it is possible but unless you have a really long growing season there it would take such a massive hit that it would take about  weeks to recover and become decently rooted if it doesnt bleed dry of water first.

7553389,0,t3_4iso1i,I live in Florida and that to me is a shrub outside. We dont bother picking off the old flowers but it wont hurt if you want it keep it clean.the thing is that plant may have been greenhouse grown. It may be used to lower light. You could adapt it to full all day sun but if you went from shade to full sun it would burn it. So you might ask where you bought it  what would be best. Lots of times the grower ltnot the place you bought it fromgt will use a growth regulator on hibiscus it makes the plant more compact. That will wear off eventually in a few months. They use that chemical on Poinsettias and Mums. Thats why they look so nice and squatty. Yes go slow on the repots. You can kill it with too much water. A big pot holds more water. At  degrees the plant is slightly in a dormant state. Watering has a lot of variables the temp the humidity the air circulation. Id say the warmer the better. If its in the s or s in the summer keep it outside in mostly shade but good morning or late afternoon sun. Sounds like you plan to overwinter it inside so no use adapting it to full hot sun.I would just give it a  off haircut in the early summer or spring whenever it is the temps go up where you live. Not this year though. A lot of those plants are grown in huge commercial greenhouse operations in central Florida. They have contracts and ship them north by the container truck full. ,gardening,d30s8ww,1,t5_2qhkh

7571880,0,t3_4j0urq,Im sorry that most of these people havent been really helpful to you at your scale. Two of the comments are about pulling them out which you already said you dont want to do. The vinegar herbicide route is also a spot method and would be problematic over large areas.My yard used to be crawling with dandelions until I read somewhere that it prefers soils that are low in calcium. I would suggest you get a soil test to make sure that this is the case in your most highly infested spots. Another possible problem is high potassium because most lawn fertilizers come in ratios like . So if your soil naturally retains potassium like in clay there may be a build up in its concentration. My response in tackling the problem was liming for calcium and using soybean meal as the fertilizer which has a much lower potassium content. What people need to realize about weeds is that most are pioneering crops and have specific ranges which they prefer to survive in. After altering the low calcium and high potassium levels in my lawn I have eliminated dandelions and most other weeds. ,gardening,d32vwcg,3,t5_2qhkh

7603306,0,t1_d36cu1i,Ok what you have there is the remains of someones flower border surrounding a tiny rectangle of lawn grass. A pocket garden IOW.The large green leafy things I believe are all hostas which are a desirable border perennial that you want to keep.  Hostas. They are very forgiving tough as boot leather if given half a chance and they do bloom very prettily sometimes in early summer sometimes in late summer depending on the cultivar. Their only real enemy is slugs to whom they are candy. Youll know if you have slugs because youll start seeing holes in the leaves. Put out slug bait or saucers of beer if that happens.The lawn grass doesnt look too bad. Give it some ordinary turfgrass fertilizer and keep it clipped. Turfgrass grows better if its kept mowed as it encourages it to branch out and become stronger. See rlawncare for more specifics.Cant do a damn thing about the gas meter and the downspout except pretend they arent there. Sorry. Generally when you have bare dirt covered with manymany tinytiny seedlings those are weeds.  Thats where a weed went to seed and exploded its seed pods all over the vicinity. A tool called a Yankee weeder or alternatively an ordinary hoe is useful for clearing out manymany tinytiny weed seedlings without needing to pull them individually.So you basically have a hosta border but I see places where you can add a bit of color. Since it faces west but presumably has enough shade from trees and other buildings during the afternoon that someone planted hostas there Im going to assume were looking at flowers for shade.You want to add some kind of border delineating the edges as the white lines show. This can be anythingrocks bricks whatever. It doesnt need to be buried like a paver border its mainly for psychological use. Its outlining where the flowerbed begins and the lawn stops. This will help you to maintain the edge so it  looks like an intentional plantingpocket lawn and flower border not random conglomeration of plants.Over on the right Ive given you a couple of flowerpots or planters preferably terracotta or dark green color. In these Id put impatiens. Its an annual for shade.Against the wall Id put some New Guinea impatiens which are larger and showier than regular impatiens.  You want to tuck their root ball in behind and under the hostas not too close to the wall. Hostas play nice with impatiens. Just push the leaves aside and poke the root ball into the dirt.All around the three sides in front of the hostas Id put wax begonias which are another annual for shade.The cluster of pink on the lefthand corner is a placeholder for the hostas filling in. Id use some regular impatiens here.Give the hostas some food either a topdressing with compost bone meal and composted manure or a shot of any kind of For blooms granular fertilizer. They dont need a lot. Follow the instructions on the box.Once you have everything planted mulch for weed control and moisture conservation.  I like shredded bark as its not so lumpy as wood chips and looks nicer than straw or dried grass clippings. The ultra mulch is cocoa bean hulls but they are so expensive. They smell awesome though.,gardening,d36gg48,3,t5_2qhkh

7711118,0,t1_d3ioiug,Yeah leafy greens dont do so well in the spring here except for ones like swiss chard and others that are quite heat tolerant. If you plant early enough they do ok but not great. Most cool weather plants that are typically grown in the spring elsewhere do better planted in fall and grown over winter here.Most peppers effectively have  seasons here. We get some early fruit in first part of summer but then most plants will stop producing during July amp August due to extreme heat. They start back up again in September and keep producing through fall. I do have a couple varieties that dont seem to mind the heat amp will keep producing right on through the  degree days though.This is what our planting calendar looks like ,gardening,d3ipalc,1,t5_2qhkh

7733072,0,t3_4l8fzm,Last year I put in  hydrangeas in the gardens around my trees in the back for shade.  In fall I trimmed the dead flower heads but not the branches because I read that the new buds were supposed to spring from the branches.  I do the same to my big hydrangea snowball bushes in the front which do very well and do in fact generate buds on the existing branches.  I covered them over the winter but come spring they appear mostly dead.  This is a picture of a better one where there is some leafy regrowth at the very bottom.  There are no buds to be seen at all and all branches appear brittle and very dead.  I dont see how they will possibly bloom this year?  Others dont even have leafy regrowth and appear totally dead but Im not sure if they may show some life if I just wait so I havent pulled them yet.  I bought several different types but this one happened to have the plastic tag still stuck in it so I know it was an endless summer variety.  I dont know for sure if all leafy ones were endless summer.  I later read that sometimes cheap potted hydrangeas are florist variety and will not rebloom.  Is this true?  This was about  in plants and actually this pattern dead and mostly dead hydrangeas has happened two years in a row now so the investment was even more.  Im at my wits end.  How should I be caring for my hydrangeas??  I live in Northern Ohio zone .,gardening,d3l71s8,2,t5_2qhkh
7737078,0,t3_4la0ud,first let me say i enjoy home automation and have my own little setup. that being said this isnt something i would buy because it has too many inherent flaws. holding up in the weather is a big question. youd obviously want to set up and take down every year taking away from the time savings it could supposedly provide.cost  you either need to purchase one of these for each raised bed or move it between your beds. at which point you might as well just put the seeds in the soil yourself. once its done planting its essentially an insanely expensive drip system....i highly doubt its as efficient as they show in the vids. you notice each shot planting seeds they have to cut away after one or two successful ones. watering from above like this works well for seedlings but when the plants get bigger dropping a little water right on their heads is essentially the worst way to water. that being said its cool that you can d print your own parts and build and repair yourself. i think itd be a very fun project to mess around with but i dont think its a viable product that many consumers will want. ,gardening,d3lnebd,2,t5_2qhkh

8159961,0,t3_4qxv7v,. For my climate.....using the Hugelkultur method of layering organic matter and soil in my raised garden beds has saved me considerable money regarding water and supplementing fertilizer. The Hugelkultur layering helped provide the right amount of nutrients and water the plants need via wicking. The humus wood layer also worked as a water bank or a giant nutrient dense sponge holding water from snow or rainfall as well as catching nutrients that drain downward. For my climate in Northern NV this is incredibly important. . Building a really healthy soil takes a long time at least a few years. By using the Hugelkultur method I mentioned above as well as several different layers of organic matter on top of that....the difference in plant health moisture retention and efficiency and a reduction in blights and molds was astounding. . You should NOT till your soil. This is easier to control for raised garden bed methods vs in ground. Tilling breaks up the soil structure which causes the soil to not retain moisture like it should. It also causes the organic matter to breakdown improperly and it does not support the biodiversity healthy soil needs decomposers organisms aerobic bacteria.By using different layers of organic matter and soils throughout the year and only digging where you plant or when you turn in the top layer of mulch....this helps retain the best nutrients and moisture levels as well as fostering strong biodiversity. . Growing cover crops that fix nitrogen into the soil as well as build up soil structure really helps reduce how much organic matter you need to outsource for your garden. The key to a notill covercrops is to chop most of the plants down then pull the plants up roots included and lay it all down where they grew. Wait a day for it to cook then cover it all with a layer of compost then manure then spent alfalfa straw mulch then more compost then a blanket of fresh straw to overwinter. . Using dry but green alfalfa straw as a mulch layer was crucial in helping keep the watering low. At least  inches of noncompacted alfalfa straw ontop of the micro emitters. When the garden needs to be put to bed simply start a cover crop or gently fold in the spent mulch into the top few inches then later as I listed above. . Trellis or train squashmeloncucumber vines up and away from the mulch later. This helps prevent powdery mildew as well as support fruits. For pumpkin vines simply try and keep the straw dry and away from direct contact of the vine. . All plants need good air flow specifically squashmeloncucumber vines lush herbs like basil and corn. This prevents blight molds and root crowding. . Remove the lowest leavesbranches as soon as they start to yellow. Provide at least  inches of space between the bottom most leaves and the mulch layer. Add thicker mulch layers as the plants grow taller. . Allow the ground to dry out for at least a day but only under the protection of a good mulch layer. This is important for the microorganisms the soil gassing and root growth. . Plan  crop periods. This helps so you can remove tired plants or vines and already have a new crop starting elsewhere. . Learn how to preserve starter bulbsclovesseeds.. Learn how to preserve heirloom and target crop seeds by hand pollinating and closing off blooms. Then learn how to select the best harvest allow maximum fruit maturation and then learn how to collect and preserve seeds for the next year. It really sucks when you have that ultimate plant with the best tomato or squash and you forget to collect seeds. Then you never experience that flavor or that plants vigor and hardiness again. . Designing and planting specific garden bed boxes to only grow a pollinator flower bed is incredibly important.  Pick perennial plants that bloom from very early to very late in the season. Also select annual plants that reseed easily and bloom from the very beginning to the very end of the growing season. Also using some native plants helps attract and support native species of biodiversity. Design the flower bed locations to start on the perimeter of the garden area and then locate a new flower bed further and further in to draw the pollinators further and further in.. Plant your sacrificial crops within your pollinator garden beds. I plant sacrificial tomatoes dill native milkweeds squash vines brassica carrots and herbs throughout the flowerbeds so when I come across hornworms or other various caterpillars or insects I simply toss them into the pollinator gardens. I treasure hummingbird moths other moths flower longhorn beetles even the funny inchworm. I am also painfully aware of the lack of insect activity in the world compared to when I was a child and it scares me. . I never use pesticides except for Terro for when I have relentless house ants or harvester red ants that sting my daughter. I have since learned that the best insect control is a few natural predator species as well as a few nonchemical traps. My best pest control for the bane of my existence earwigs is the Almighty Toad. I have a large Toad Sanctuary where I collect toads that are doomed to be squished in the road they are patrolling...and I transplant them into my garden beds and toad ponds. My main garden is  raised garden beds that are ft long  ft wide  or  ft deep. It is a lot of garden.Each garden bed has at least  breeding toads or  juvenile toadlings. The toads are insatiable and will eat anything that movesfits in their mouth between dusk and dawn. They live from  years if you take care of them they hibernate and are avoided by most other animals. Toads will control earwigs snails and slugs rolly pollies and sow bugs weevils katydids MayJune beetles and any other insect that moves at night. I often collect my pest insects and save them for dusk when my toads are waking up. Lacewing flies will not only control aphidthripwhitefly infestations they will also lay eggs around aphid populations for as long as aphids are around that area. This means that you will have generations of lacewings year after year with no need to buy more like with ladybugs or mantis. Beneficial nematodes help eradicate root weevils June Bug or pest beetle larva soil dwelling pests even gnats and midges. Leaving soysaucecorn oilbeer traps around infested plants helps trap pest species that work at night. . Designing your garden to be watered by drip irrigation which is set up on the same system as your landscaping sprinklers or irrigation....eliminates forgetting to water or worrying about leaving for any length of time. . Using microemmiter tubing that slowly and deeply waters the root circle of each plant or crop area is by far the best method of irrigation followed by underground watering. Drip watering allows you to slowly water the plants only in the soil area that needs it. It also allows the water to seep down deeply causing the plants to grow deeper roots for better growth. You have to use this method with  inches of loose mulch covering your drip lines. This helps protect the tubing from the sun which causes premature cracking. The mulch also prevents the soil from drying out quickly as well as providing much needed shade to the roots of the plants on the hottest days. . In my region you need to design your garden to accommodate hoop covers or something similar. This helps extend your growing season by allowing you to plant earlier or grow later in the Fall. The  other mostimportant reasons are because monsoon season brings apocalypselevel hail wind storms microbursts and macrobursts and sudden flooding.  summer temps can reach  for several days and by providing some shade this helps prevent blossoms from dropping or plants from being stressed from the heat. Hoop covers or coverframes that are already installed can easily be pulled over to cover gardens from hailmonsoonal rainwind that can destroy every single plant. The key is to design the hoopcovers to be low and sturdy enough to not be blown away and easy to open via velco traps holding the plastic already secure on the frame. Covering your garden before you leave on days of potential thunderstorms can help prevent coming home to a garden decimated by hail.. Squirrels are evil furbags that will take a bite from every single fruit or veggie regardless if they are ripe...just to spite you. The Squirrinator trap works well. Or a . pellet rifle. Or a Border Collie that is trained to stalk and kill them. Finches love Sunflowers...and not just the seeds. They will eat the whole plant tear apart leaves or kill young plants. Birds also can destroy a good majority of your orchard crops....birdnetting over fruit trees and sunflowers is worth it. . You will never stop learning how to be a better Gardener. It is a infinite evolution in regards to knowledge wisdom and love. Take your failures as lessons and share your successes generously. ,gardening,d4xjkd1,3,t5_2qhkh

You have two options with the affected fruit... You can cut it off the plant so the plant can focus on producing new fruit or you can leave it on and let it finish. Sometimes the first fruit or two will have a touch of end rot  on my plants because its easy to over water with all the rain we got. I just picked the first ripe ones and theres a bad spot on the bottom but I will just cut it off and the rest of the softballsized tomato is good eats. ,gardening,d5a6lhg,3,t5_2qhkh

If theres more to it Id like to know.  does the water always comes out as fast as I saw it do in the video on the kickstarter. Thats not ideal for a lot of plants.  I says indoors but can it be used for outdoor plants? If you keep the box in a rain freee area can the hoses be run to outdoor pots like on a patio. Can the box be kept outside at all? can the hoses be outside at all?  it says it comes with  presets for the begining gardener. What does that mean? Do you set it to Aloe or Stepmothers tongue or Ivy and it just does it or does that mean you only have  possible settings you can use and the consumer needs to figure out the volume of water on their own.. or is it by time... thats neccessary info. It wasnt clear how much you can adjust the water intake or output.If Im just using it for  plants or if I have a shitload of plants that need a bunch of attention why wouldnt I just use methods like a bubble or an upside down water bottle with holes in it or just watering it every... whenever I remember my indoor plants are so abused but ALIVE and then I wouldnt have to have these hoses snaking around my house like a creepy vascular systemI realize some of these might sound harsh but youre asking for a lot of money for an item that frankly already has competing solutions. What makes yours BETTER than any of the other options that could be used for less money? What problem will it fix for me without creating new ones? Its a nifty box for your personal use but why should we give you money? EDIT Read your previous Indigogo stuff. Its the exact same thing. No one gave you money you didnt improve it at all and here you are again... Why? God I hate this crowd fund culture shit. Occasionally good things get ignored.

8774624,0,t1_d72akul,If the grass layer is comprised of the turfgrass species that youre going to reseed the lawn with then removing it is  counterproductive. Its roughly four times as fast to fill in a bare spot in the lawn by encouraging the surrounding grass to expand into the bare spot than it is to scatter some grass seed on the bare spot and wait for it to grow up.  Grass is a weed remember. People are always have to pull it out of their flowerbeds because it has runners and stolons that aggressively colonize in all directions.  If you have existing turfgrass in your lawn with a little encouragement it will rapidly begin to aggressively colonize in all directions.But it cant do that if you used a pickaxe to dig it all up and discard it.  It can take  to  months depending on climate and time of year for a bare spot in the lawn to be fully filledin with mature grass if you start from seed but only a month or so if you remove the weedy competition topdress with rich compost or other organic matter add a sprinkling of fertilizer and keep the patch moist.  You encourage the grass plants to colonize the nice moist rich soil next to them which they will do in a heartbeat.If the grass layer is comprised of crabgrass goose grass foxtail and other weedy grass species then digging up the layer is pointless as these are all annual grasses that grow from seed in spring scatter more seed over the summer and then die in fall. I.e. now.  Theyre finished for the year theyve done their damage and filled up your soil with thousands more seeds. Digging them up now does nothing to remove the weed problem and it actively brings to the soils surface even more numbers of deeply buried weed seeds from previous years even from previous decades. Its normal when digging around in your yard such as to build a retaining wall or excavate a trench for a drain to find the next year that you have weeds youve never even seen before especially agricultural weeds like like bull thistle burdock and field bindweed. Those seeds were all down in the soil waiting left over from when your suburban lot was farmland. If you have a yard that is literally full of crabgrass and no turfgrass is left at alland Im talking from the standpoint of an actual scientific observation and census Im not talking about a seatofthepants eyeball estimate speaking in broad terms Yeah this lawn is all crabgrass Im talking about where you get down on your hands and knees and actually crawl around your yard checking and identifying all the grassy stuff thats growing therethen you proceed differently. You ignore all the weedy stuff simply killing it off with Roundup and then pulling and raking it out of the way and you go ahead and plant your grass seed this fall with all the concomitant preparations and then next spring you embark upon a rigorous and uncompromising program of preemergents laid down in late winter or whenever your extension office says that its time to do that. All those weedy grasses grow from seed every spring but a preemergent laid down in a timely manner will stop them or at least slow them down some.  Youll have to keep doing it every spring for a while. Its like I said renovating a lawn isnt a quick project.,gardening,d72htrh,2,t5_2qhkh

I hammered some scrap xs in the ground then wrapped the wire around it and stapled along the way. I left the top of the wire uncovered so its very uncomfortable for animals to stick their neck in it and little ones cant crawl through. As for a gate I would make a rectangle or square out of wood for mine its as high as the chicken wire and .ft wide then staple the wire onto it and screw more wood to the back of it. Like a sandwich. Attach two or three hinges and make sure it opens the way you want. All of this depends on how long you want it to last.

Cherry tomatoes varieties are also good halved.  So together you could probably have a pretty good drying tomato.  You can make sundried tomatoes either semidry or alltheway dry I completely dry them for shelflife.  If you completely dry them you can grind them and make tomato powder then mix that with water for paste or use the powder for other tomato powder applications.  The thin slices are also a pretty good snack.

8939011,0,t1_d7lwes7,gtfor now its their responsibility to contain their chickens since free ranging isnt legal here.That is  true but you said in your OP...gtIm about to buy a pellet gun and start shooting any chicken on my property on sight. Ive thought about leaving out chicken feed with rat poison in it but I dont want to hurt any neighborhood wildlife. At this point I have literally had dreams about massacring chickens with feathers and blood going everywhere. I woke up smiling.... that you were angry enough to start shooting and poisoning chickens and that you cant sleep at night and that you have nightly fantasies of blood everywhere. So in that case it seems to me that its better to simply quietly fence them out with a couple rolls of chicken wire and some cheap slats just for your peace of mind and to keep yourself from turning up on my Facebook Trending Now news feed sidebar.It will look ugly as sin yes and be awkward as hell to live withbut if the alternative is guns and poison and dreams of bloody massacres Id consider it worth it.  It might also make an obviously visible point to your neighbor.gtThe vegetable garden has a . foot high chicken fence I dont raise chickens and even I know that a . foot high fence isnt a chicken fence. Ive personally witnessed chickens in petting zoos and on historic farm sites fly over higher fences than that. According to the Interwebs a  foot high fence is the norm for backyard chickens although if motivated they can fly higher.A  foot roll of  poultry netting is about . A  foot roll is even less. An  foot tall coated metal garden stake a bean pole is about . The netting doesnt have to be professionally installed it just has to deter chickens.Bottom line its only been a month. Touch base with the compliance person see how its going.You might also talk to other neighbors and see if theyre having chicken problems too. A consortium of neighbors all inundating Neighborhood Services with phone calls is a lot more effective at goosing slowmoving bureaucrats into action. If everyone on the block calls in to complain about the same thing that gets faster action.gttheyre a cute family and I dont want to get them in trouble.Theyre already in trouble now.

I fixed your OP without the weird formatting hth.gtI woke up depressed this morning having no reason to go outside to sit in the morning sun with a cup of Joe to look at the garden.  Its all gone!  Even my regular birdy visitors have flown. gtIve got carrots in the fridge to process in a mock brown sugar glaze using my dial gauge pressure cooker in mason jars we pulled carrots after moved all the covering straw to the compost bin along with any potting soil from the now empty container garden to let the straw decompose on its own. Even the worms have not ben eating much of the vegetable scraps Im giving them theyve migrated to the bottom of the binthough they are still producing babies like crazy.gtWeve only got three kinds of tomato left including a few Romas a green Japanese a few rows of green onion kale and one birds nest gourd left growing  even though were weeks away from the first front.  The yard looks so depressingly empty I cant stand it.   Ive put away all of the gardening tools.  We harvested the last of the herbs and I have herbs drying upside down from the overhead.  I gathered up a dozen cups of Basil and washed the leaves last night  strained and checked them then popped them  into the dehydrator so this morning they are brittle and ready to be ground down into powder for  use in the kitchen.  I froze a few leaves for cooking purposes.   Ive got all of the cucumbers sitting in my grandmas old german fermenting crocks in a salty kosher brine  Im making sour and dill pickles todays job was to removed a thin layer of bubbly foam off the top  this is the only sign I have that they are fermenting nicely.  I will be removing a few for canning this evening. gtIm so  depressed about having little to nothing to do.  I wandered into the garden looking for my resident praying mantis in the Marigolds bin.  George lives in that beautiful flower bed with the dozen or so earth snakes who also took up residence this spring.  those are  long brown snakes who eat bugs....  I just came back inside depressed got my second cup and I am here in front of this  computer instead of getting my sunlight.gtWe turned over the beds last night after harvesting and this morning Im on my own.  Damn!  Every year this happens I enjoy the growing season in the garden and now that the season is over for  of the garden and the rest is beginning to die back Im going to have to emotionally deal with getting thru a depressing winter once again.    I plan to spend my time reading seed catalogs dreaming about what changes I want to make tools I  want to buy techniques I want to try  and learn new ways to process food for long term storage along with rotating stock in the pantry.  After the first frost I will replan my garden approach once again  using elevated beds and Bartholomews square meter system.gtThere are only so many times one can turn over compost before being bored out of ones mind. Im Back to cooking and canning instead! Ive picked up a bunch of books thru Amazon for Kindle for PC that I will read on cold long winter days.I really hate when season is over and there is little to nothing to do in the yard. I guess Im stuck just sitting in a chair in the sunlight dreaming of warmer days to come once again. I am already missing my garden.Pics are the same.  I see lots of green green grass. Next year do some fallwinter crops theyll keep you busy until January and time to start ordering spring seeds.Fall crops get planted at the end of August for harvest during the fall and winter.

I grew butternuts this year and they were great!  Still Ive been thinking about trying to grow them vertically to reduce their footprint in the garden.  Thats the only way I think I can justify them in place of other summer crops.  Semigood tomatoes are  bucks a pound.  Butternuts go on sale for  cents a pound at kroger in the fall.

9747682,0,t1_daek92f, Good well drained soil. Potting mix compost mixing manure and sand into an existing clay bed whatever. It just needs to be fertile and not become rock hard when it dries. Like most vegetables and fruits theyre supposed to be full sun. However mine are between a metal ramp and a glass window in  Virginia August heat so I have them mostly in full sun except when the sun is at its peak in the sky then the edge of the shadow from a nearby oak tree covers them for a few hours. Extreme intensity of light and heat can evaporate water from the plant faster than its roots can absorb more which makes it wilt and die or sunburn the pepper itself which causes the side of the fruit facing the sun to become brown and leathery. The humidity is hell too but thats a problem for me not the plants. If you have a climate like this put the nightshade side of your garden peppers tomatoes eggplant in part sun. No frost or cold. They wont immediately crumble to dust if you plant them outside before nighttime lows rise above  like tomatoes do but they like to make and ripen fruit in peak summer heat and a hard frost will end them. Mulch with wood or fallen leaves to hold water in and water whenever the leaves droop or x per week whichever comes first. I just have a sprinkler for my entire vegetableherb garden that I turn on whenever anything there looks like it needs water so the peppers probably get more than they need. Also if you live in a hot climate like me only water in the mornings and evenings otherwise it will be evaporated. When I pull weeds in  heat with  humidity my water bottle keeps my cold drink from evaporating and my hat protects me from sunburns hopefully someone breeds food plants with something similar someday. Plants with opposable thumbs would be so cool. Theyre susceptible to lots of bugs and fungi just about anything that exists likes to eat them. Their...I dont know...plant immune systems protect them well I can go years without a single infestation of anything. But in the rare event they do get something it takes them quickly without treatment. You can get a spray bottle of neem oil for about  if they start to look splotchy or chewed. Growing in raised beds or containers makes the roots less susceptible to eating by voles and nutrient sucking by tree roots and allows you to better control the soil makeup. This does mean theyll need more frequent fertilizing though unless you use a quickly decomposing mulch like leaves or hay. Some peppers are pickier than others my bell peppers DGAF in ground level clay as long as they get regular water and leaf mulch and the thin layer of topsoil several years of decomposed mulch creates while my banana peppers and jalapeos like a raised bed with potting soil or compost. Actually jalapeos dont have to be babied but the more stress you put them under without killing them the spicier they get and that could make them unsuitable for jalapeo poppers or chiles rellenos.I dont know what problem youre having but that covers everything I can think of.,gardening,daem4b8,4,t5_2qhkh

Its size says that it has been happy wherever it has been growing so leave it there. It is unhappy because it is overwatered.  The spaces between the soil particles are normally filled with air. The fine root hairs whose job it is to uptake water and nutrients need oxygen to live. When you water these spaces become filled with water but then gravity pulls the excess down and out of the pot through the bottom drainage hole leaving a thin film of water molecules coating the soil particles. The fine root hairs thus have both the water and the oxygen they need.But if you water too often or if the soil is dense and slowdraining the air spaces are continually filled with water and deprived of oxygen the fine root hairs begin to die. Anaerobic rot bacteria begin to proliferate. Since the fine root hairs are dead and dying and can no longer uptake water the plant wilts. The classic symptom of overwatering is a wilted plant with wet soil. Why is it wilted? The soil is wet!Take it out of the pot and check the roots for rootbound and repot it in some new potting soil that is one part ordinary houseplant potting soil one part peat moss or coco peat and one part perlite or vermiculite.The pot must have a hole in the bottom for drainage. This is mandatory and nonnegotiable. The plant must stand above a tray or saucer so that the excess water has somewhere to go and will not wick back up into the pot.That saucer there is acceptable IF every time you water you remove the saucer immediately and dump out the excess water.Give it some ordinary houseplant fertilizer every  months or so.If when you take it out of the pot its a solid mass of roots consider either dividing it into two plants or repotting it into a larger pot.  When you repot it clear away all the dead leaves and stems.In future water it only when you stick your finger into the soil and feel it and its dry about  to  down.  This will not be on a calendar or human schedule so you need to check it daily until you get a sense of how often it needs to be watered.,gardening,db94s3p,4,t5_2qhkh

I got my Baker Creek Heirloom catalog in the mail the other day and would love to start planning. My cucumbers exploded and I was drowning in them and my tomatoes did great for a little while but ended up with blossom end rot towards the end of the season. I also had an overabundance of jalapeo peppers bell peppers and eggplant  Japanese and whatever the normal larger eggplant is called lol. I had planted cabbage but couldnt keep whatever was eating them away and ended up pulling them. They were riddled with holes. I also planted zucchini and while the plants were huge and seemed to be doing great I only harvested  rhe entire season. I would LOVE for someone to offer any suggestions they have to keep my garden looking beautiful this coming Spring and Summer. And if you have planting suggestions of things that do well in this area that would be greatly appreciated!  I am all ears for learning!  Also.

10105837,0,t3_5jx07i,Any recommendations on green bean varieties? Looking forward to the coming season. Seeds I have used so far are from Burpee. Zone baMy first year I did Garden Bean provider and holy hell did it produce a ton of beans. I was out picking every other day just to keep up and it wouldnt stop. However they became bland to eat as the year went on. It could have been I was getting tired of them or the flavor of the beans reduced as the season went on. Maybe both?This past year my second year I did Bush Lake  and I was extremely disappointed. While the flavor was slightly better then beans were a bit tough no matter the age I picked the bean. Only roughly  of the plants grew any beans... I had a lot of just big leafy plants. Also they mostly produced their beans all at once and I didnt get much more out of them after the first couple pickings.What I would like is a bush variety bean like the providers I had that will continue to spurt out beans quickly but with a better flavor.

10547575,0,t3_5r0h9n,I see no mention of the fact that the plastic buckets require holes in the bottom for drainage. This is nonnegotiable. Usually with that kind of plastic this means drilling holes.  The holes from the buckets need to be lined up with the bottom supporting slats to allow the drainage water to drip freely onto the ground. If the holes are on a slat A it blocks the drainage and B it rots the slat because the water will seep out eventually.Does remember to put your containers in BEFORE you attach the trim mean that the buckets are permanently installed and are not removable? If so this considerably lessens the actual utility of the box as a planter. In larger planters you expect to have to excavate them in order to remove soil and plants. In smaller buckets the default is to remove the bucket so any gardener working with one of these Look what I made for you! is eventually going to encounter puzzlement and frustration.Those are  liter buckets which is about  gallons. Soil weighs about  lbs per cubic foot so  gallons of soil is about  cubic feet of soil so the soil alone will weigh about  lbs. Add in the  weight of the lumber and you have something that once placed in position on the patio will be immovable without several strong backs and possibly a dolly.So this is why large wooden planters are frequently put on casters not feet. The casters allow you to move it from place to place as the suns light and heat change during the year and then to put the whole thing in the garage for the winter. Or else you put the planter on a plant dolly with casters ditto.,gardening,dd3ooup,3,t5_2qhkh

It can be built up on legs or just raised by putting it on something that will support it.  Keep in mind the weight the soil and water will add to it  your bed will need support.  And you dont need to use expensive wood.  You can use untreated yellow pine if thats cheapest.

Like in the orange groves of years gone by they would flood the orchard down channels and the swale would fill. I guess they did this about once a week and more during dry spells. Cut out suckers and internal crossing branches and dead wood. Fertilize with citrus specific products mulch under the tree weed. Throw down some gypsum epsom salts and build a swale basically a ring around the tree. Dont over water but give it a nice thorough drink as mentioned above. The suckers are the straight vertical shoots rising from the roots sometimes originating in the original root stock below the graft of the commercial tree. Branches with particularly gnarly covered in thorns are an abomination that will never fruit cut those out as well.If you have black tar like exudate and aphids mix a bag of pipe tobacco Dr. Bronners and water to make your own spray filter and pump spray particularly under the leaves.

Scalp it down to the ground with a lawn mower or weed whacker then cover it up hold the covering down at the edges with bricks.  After  months in darkness it will all be dead.  Dont allow it to poke tendrils or stems out into the light theyre the life support system.Or you can kill it and some of the seeds too with solarization. For maximum effect scalp it all down to the ground with a mower or weedwhacker then cover it all with ml clear landscaping plastic comes on big rolls at the garden center or Big Box DIY. Hold it down tight to the soil all the way around with bricks or stones you dont want tendrils escaping out from under.  Wait  months. This works best during the height of summer and my understanding of AUS climate is that you have lethally hot summers anyway so covering it with clear plastic to cook in the sun is basically nuking it from orbit. The heat will kill seeds about  to  down here in the U.S. Midwest and probably deeper where you are. So then as long as you dont till or spade it up which brings new seeds from deeper you basically have a blank slate.For use in existing flowerbeds lay down cardboard cut to fit around your shrubs or perennials then put  to  of mulch on top shredded bark wood chips whatever. ,gardening,dg23z6s,1,t5_2qhkh

11581840,0,t3_65arb2,I have made a sub for my American friends after somebody asked me whether one existed.I have received many questions and comments from people who are concerned about state customs and quarantine regulation the spreading of pests and diseases illegal and noxious plants. So I have many it abundantly clear on the subreddit that is important for people to research their states and their trading partners customs and quarantine regulation regarding the plants they want to trade if they want to trade interstate.I have also made a wiki page for people to put in links and info about their states regulation.  Feel free to add links and info if you feel so inclined. I have also made relevant subreddits including this one easily accessible for people who want to ask questions about their states customs regulation by placing the links in the FAQ page.In addition to this I will be adding automoderator messages to people who post from states which have quarantine zones to notify them that they need to research their states regulations even when trading within the state. If you know whether your state has quarantine zones please tell me here Please include some extra info if you can e.g. which plants and pests what areas links etc.Posts in the subreddit should be flaired with the stateterritory of the poster. So if somebody wants to trade within their state and avoid these risks they can filter the sub for their states flair type in search bar flairState Postal Abbreviation and tick limit to sub e.g. flairTX and find all posts with plants from their state.,gardening,dg8t42f,2,t5_2qhkh

11613212,0,t1_dgcbvg0,Haha yes love the new word cachepot! Very useful gtgtI suppose if its a really blazing sunny southfacing windowsill there is a small chance it might get a bit too hot and fierce for a newlytransplanted seedling thats struggling a bit.... probably an east or northfacing windowsill might be better if thats the case but in Europe in April Id be surprised unless you are having a heatwave over there?! This is my southfacing bathroom windowsill here in Ireland  the sunniest windowsill in the house and the tomatoes and courgettes are doing great although the weather here is mostly overcast so I take all the sun I can get!My kitchen windowsill faces north and is dark as fuck so my kitchen herbs get quite tall and leggy too as they dont get enough sun.... Something you could try with the basil is to turn the long stems into cuttings and reroot themUsing a very sharp clean knife cut the stem to about the length of your finger measuring from the growing tip of the plant cutting just below a leaf node and pull off the lowest leaves.Cuttings will root happily in a glass of water  put a piece of foil over the top and poke holes in it for the stems to go through so that the cut end of the stem is in the water but the leaves are sitting on top of the foil if that makes sense... After a few weeks you should see roots starting to form at the cut end of the stems at which point you can pot them up into small pots to grow on as a nowmuchshorter basil plant!When the plant starts growing again and has put on a few sets of leaves pinching out the main growthtip can encourage the plant to grow more sidebranches and remain shorter and more bushy gtgtHope that helps!Woody gtgt,gardening,dgcd8np,2,t5_2qhkh

Also close  of the tarp outside the hatch cut a little slit right where the latch catches so you can latch your trunk over the tarp. This will minimize the dirt getting into the crack between the bumper and the trunk.

Though their smallest size with plant suggestions is a square meter  x .If Austin werent a climate famed for heat and droughts I would be tempted to get a container myself just for the topsyturvy nature of how you do it according to that article.  Avoid pots with drainage holes if the pot has one plug it.  The best soil is a nice heavy clay garden soil not potting soil and never use compost or shudder manure.  If Maryland is anything like Virginia God knows youll never run out of clay.  You definitely want gravel in your pot.
