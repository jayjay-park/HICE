PS If possible I would like it to be female and its name to be the original one Vivillon. I am not so fond of nicknames Im afraid. XDEDIT I will have to leave for personal matters tomorrow and will be occupied until Wednesday. I wont be able to interact much so that means that I may not catch you online. But from Wednesday onwards I WILL be on so we can trade by then provided that my offer interests you. I will contact you then hopefully. ,VivillonExchange,ck4wls8,1,t5_2yr1t
