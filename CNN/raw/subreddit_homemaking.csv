6663556,0,t3_46wwq9,Im also not a fulltime homemaker although I have been and just work less than my husband so take responsibility for more of the household tasks. My tips come from my days as fulltime homemaker and are things Ive carried on have a schedule eg a room or task for each day. You might have regular activities which shape this eg friendsfamily who visit regularly or work schedules. Let your husband know what the schedule is especially when laundry is going to get done  this has been an important one for us also knowing the schedule helps him know what he can do to help when he has more time! give yourself manageable tasks to do each time so you dont get overwhelmed but do feel like youre getting something meaningful done eg if you dont have a lot of time break a room up into sections and dust one day and vacuum the next. when cleaning a room go from top to bottom ie after tidying away clutter dust the things that are highest first working your way down to vacuuming last. for areas you dont like to clean for me its the bathroom! set a timer. Youll be amazed at how much you get done in as little as  minutes and wont have to spend lots of time on something you dont like! make a meal plan each week. Itll help you know what to buy and will mean that you dont have to think about what to cook each day  you can just look at the plan when you get home from work and cook whatever youve planned for that day. It can also help with budgeting  I dont have a budget for food shopping at the moment but I put the meal plan in place when I did.Did your husband already have any of this in place when he was doing the homemaking? There may be things particular to your home and lifestyle that he can pass on to you.Sorry that was more than one tip! Hope theres something helpful for you in all that!!,homemaking,d08khro,4,t5_2tbln
6905359,0,t3_4a7b8l,So my family had a similar problem with our downstairs when I was much younger. I remember my parents mixed ground cinnamon with paint when they redid the cabinets. I was really young so thats all I remember but it might be worth a try? Maybe first try washing the walls with vinegar and keeping a box of baking soda in there? ,homemaking,d0z1isp,1,t5_2tbln

7203392,0,t3_4ddims,I dont use gloves to clean because Im zero waste so no disposables. I have used rags and towels to pick up icky stuff in lieu of using gloves but for everyday stuff I dont use harsh chemical cleaners so I dont need gloves anyway. ,homemaking,d1wyv8o,1,t5_2tbln
7797320,0,t3_4er0if,A little late but Ive had this problem with white shirts. One option do a vinegar soak in cold water. Second option  part dawn dish washing soap  parts  hydrogen peroxide enough baking soda to create a paste. Ex for underarms in shirts I use  Tablespoon dish washing soap  tablespoons hydrogen peroxide enough baking soda to make a paste. Stir it all up and apply to the stain. To take it a step further get a laundry brush and scrub it in. Then let it sit for  hours. Wash in a cold cycle. Before drying it pull it out and make sure the stain is gone. If it isnt reapply. If its an old stain it may take a few times. ,homemaking,d3sh8em,1,t5_2tbln

10112020,0,t3_5kmlpp,Okay instead of arguing over what to clean with what about the sterilization? Your question was about the brushes. You can soak the brushes in a  bleach solution and then put them in the dishwasher to get the max sanitization possible. As for the using bleach to clean aspect I personally learned in my babysitting class taught by a nursing school that soaking baby toys bottles even pacifiers and bottle nipples in a  solution is the best way to sanitize. Like a capful in a bucket of water. Eucalyptus oil is fantastic as an inhalant I use it myself when I feel stuffy. But Im more scared to touch the stuff than I am to touch bleach. I would do a little more research on its cleaning ability before I continue use. Finally if you like natural cleaning vinegar is a GREAT disinfectant. It stinks but the stink goes away once it dries and if you like the smell of Eucalyptus you can always get a diffuser to spread the nice smell around. ,homemaking,dbpltd7,2,t5_2tbln

11706762,0,t3_66x6fh,Tips that may be helpful depending on your personality and situation  If you live with others make sure everyone is helping in some way.  Consider decreasing the amount of things you own so you have less to clean and care for.  rdeclutter is a useful subreddit for this.  Identify what is taking up the majority of your time or what seems like the worst part of cleaning and ask this subreddit specific questions about that.  Find a home for everything.  It is easier to maintain a clean home if things are put back in their home after each use.  When an object is left out you dont have to make a decision on where to put it  you already know where its home is.  This can reduce decision fatigue.,homemaking,dgmznpq,4,t5_2tbln
