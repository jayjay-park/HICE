133608,0,t3_1vksbz,Greek Life. Not a group of friends a band of brothers. I grew up in a small Southern college town. When I started college a couple years after high school I never considered going greek. About a year after I started college I realized that my friends from high school who went there and I were going in way different directions and having time for each other was really tough to find. After going to an after party at the house I ended up joining I realized that maybe greek life would be good for me. The greatest thing is that I have not only a great group of friends now but an expansive alumni base that is always willing to help a brother out. My fraternity compared to campus average is small but what that does is foster better brotherhood within the house. In the words of nearly every older alumni who has been out for even fifty years these are the guys that will marry you and bury you. We go to each others families during holidays and breaks or long weekends. Hunt fish go to games bars parties and church together and meet some of the sweetest and prettiest girls on campus. Greek life isnt necessarily for everyone because you have to be willing to give up time to get what needs to be done done or participate in mandatory events but you get out what you put in. Some people equate it to buying friends well I know what my money goes to rent my meal plan parties brotherhood trips and fixing minor things around the house. The people who equate it to buying friends in almost all cases have never been greek and until you go greek it is hard to understand. If your campus has greek life you should look into it. Yes I stated earlier it might not be for everybody but youd be surprised. There is almost always a house for everyone on campus but you have to take the initiative to discover that for yourself.,college,cetnboi,-1,t5_2qh3z

Im looking to transfer to a full art school so I can immerse myself  in a creative environment and dedicate myself full time to learning animation. I went in to Vanderbilt as a premed student because I kinda had an idealized vision of medicine after I had neurosurgery in th grade. Also its just not the school for me Im. It really into sports nor am I into fraternities and the school culture is very consuming and isnt as diverse as I want from a school.. In any other field the right move would be to stay at Vanderbilt but it doesnt have connections to the animation industry. Also at an art school I have a greater chance to make connections with other students going into the same industry. While I do miss Nashville its a great city for college kids I wont miss Vanderbilt at all it just wasnt the right school for me.Oh and its transferring because Im still enrolled at Vanderbilt as a student just they give you the option to take a year off and come back like nothing happened.I just sent in my last transfer application so Im pretty nervous but my fall back would be to finish up my  remaining years at Vanderbilt as an art student and figure it out from there.Im applying to Pratt Parsons Carnegie Mellon SVA SCAD Ringling OTIS and cal arts.,college,cf3ely3,1,t5_2qh3z

380945,0,t1_cfk4ky8,I think it is very common to not know what you want out of life or even college when you are in college. Unfortunately there are no shortcuts to personal exploration of your dreams and ambitions.One thing I suggest you do is explore your ideas as soon as possible. If it is a certain industry or job go have coffee with professionals in that area and see what they say about it. Join student groups in that area or set up a project to do for a local company very easy to do if you are confident and say youll do it for free or low wages. If it is a certain major go find upperclassmen or professors and talk to them or take an intro class in that area. The idea is to jump in quickly now so you dont commit to something you realize you hate three years down the road.Finally never choose your major or even classes because of expectations or commands from others even your parents. It doesnt work out well. I know many people that blindly followed society or their parents expectations for their major andor for their job and they hate their life.It is perfectly fine that you dont know what you want to do but it is not fine if you continue to hesitate or dither. Go try a few things. If you dont like it or if you fail all it means is that it isnt for you. The US economy is worth  trillion.

If you want to get a PhD in economics then where you go for undergrad isnt that significant and the money would probably be better off saved for grad school which will also be very expensive. McGill does offer an Honors Economics program which is more mathbased and is adequate for grad school. McGills networking opportunities arent nearly as bad as you make them sound they are ranked stnd in Canada after all.If you want to go into businessbanking etc. then Penn would definitely be the better choice you could try transferring into Wharton. While youre networking abilities might be slightly overshadowed by Wharton with a solid enough GPA youll still be competitive for the same positions. If you would rather stay in Canada then McGill wouldnt be that much worse of a choice either since the big Canadian investment banks recruit a plenty there.No matter where you go your education isnt being compromised both Penn and McGill are world renown institutions and if you put in the effort youll be successful no matter what you do.And just a footnote economics isnt really the best program at Penn Wharton is the best by far.

1750152,0,t1_cjzrema,Ah I didnt realize you werent asking as a firsttimer.  Sorry.  I missed the second time part of your intro.Yeah.  In my experience the best way to make a difference for your class is to dedicate yourself to the cause of actually caring about your students not only as learners but as human beings who can benefit from your knowledge and grow as people not just scholars.Of course that can be harder as a lab TA but its still very doable.  The one thing it took me a long time to grasp is that theres no shame in wanting to be the fun TA.  Having fun is a great way to learn and a great way to teach.  Im a constant joker in the classroom.  I find it gives the added benefit that when my students see me stop joking and really knuckle down on something either really focusing on the content or really tearing into them for fucking up they quickly realize that they need to be taking it seriously.If I dont find myself using some variant of the phrase Im really disappointed in you guys at least once a semester I think Im doing something wrong.  If telling my students that Im disappointed in them doesnt shock them into performing to the absolute peak of their abilities I know Ive really done something wrong because I havent connected with them.Thats one thing I learned that theyll never tell you because its not professional advice.  The greatest tool a charismatic teacher has at their disposal the one thing that can bring problem students back from the brink and decent students to academic excellence is a look of wounded shameful disappointment.Sometimes when I know Im going to need it the next day say after a night of grading really shoddy papers Ill practice it in the mirror a few times to get just the right tinge of dejected melancholy in my eyes.If you have rapport and they feel like youve been treating them as social and intellectual equals up to that point it can be a great silver bullet.But dont tell anybody I said so.,college,cjzrk75,1,t5_2qh3z

I didnt because of reasons that again I can explain but Im trying to make this short. My parents forced me to apply here in my country as they see skipping a year to get my shit together as failing and I will have no future if I do so.In order to appease my parents I applied and Im now enrolled as a freshman here. Now I called UPenn and they told me that I can apply as a freshman if I withdraw from my school  before the withdrawal deadline Nov . So Im going to have a huge fight with my parents to withdraw this semester on the hopes of being accepted into one of these two schools. If I dont Ill continue here but Ill repeat the semester. Now if I apply to UPenn ED and I more likely than not I dont get accepted I will have to wait for UMiamis Early Action... I cant do that. If by the spring semester in my school I dont reapply I cant go back. So if for some reason I dont get into UMiami either Im left with nowhere to go.My only out is reapplying in my school in spring waiting for UMiamis decision and then dropping out again. But I cant waste my parents money like that. its close to k and my parents are putting all of their savings. It would be completely selfish of me.So if UPenn finds out I applied to UMiami ED as well my application is automatically withdrawn? SHIT. But how do they know??,college,ckvomad,1,t5_2qh3z

For example here is UCIs transfer admissions statistics  of admitted transfer students were from California community colleges.All of the schools are listed on the side of the page I linked but all of their Transfer Admission Profiles are pretty similar in that most students come from community colleges. Community college students get preferential treatment because they actually need a place to go and they have not yet had all the benefits yet of attending a fouryear. They are at a disadvantage in some ways. They actually need a place to go whereas students who are already attending a fouryear already have a place to go to school.Your chances will highly increase if you go to community college. Most UCs have a TAG Transfer Admission Guarantee agreement with CCCs except for UCLA UCB and UCSD. I dont know what the specific statistics are for students who transferred from CSUs. I suppose they have very high GPAs. You should check on College Confidential Edit You should just call their admissions office and ask about what students get in.

With that said there are classes that are just not worth going to. I hesitate to suggest this to a freshmansophomore as this is typically something that is learned through years of experience. But  every college student will learn a Ph.D does not indicate someone is good at teaching. I skipped a third of a semester of my international i finance class because the prof was fucking crazy. Tests didnt follow study guides books or lecture. So just really no reason to go. Still got a B in the class dont know how lol. Literally skipped half of an upper division anthropology class because all that prof did was show movies. In the first  weeks she showed  movies. And were not talking documentaries here legit blockbuster films. And her tests were always bullshit. Passed with an A. Passing the class should be your main goal. If you can do that without attending class and you feel like attending class truly will not help your grade dont. Use that time to go to the math lab high a math tutor get a study group etc. Most people blow off class to go fuck around but you really dont have that option in this case.

Hey there student we are ranked as one of the best colleges in the country but that doesnt matter because we are accredited and are ranked and that is the only thing that matters I think what you are trying to say is that you shouldnt be discouraged about not getting into a grad school if you dont attend a high ranking undergraduate school. You still have a chance in a state school as long as you do well. You still have a better chance at getting into grad school if you go to a better undergraduate school. ,college,clmf31m,1,t5_2qh3z

2301281,0,t3_2ljmmf,Who told you that companies dont like to hire accounting majors?  Every medium and large company has accountants and an accounting finance department and the Big Four accounting firms hire thousands of new hires from accounting and finance each year for audit tax and consulting roles.  Accounting majors typically do quite well when looking for internships and then jobs out of college.  This Georgetown report on college majors salaries and unemployment rates says that the median accounting major earns a starting salary of k and that accounting majors overall have an unemployment rate that is about average for all majors.  On a related noteI wouldnt go into business expecting a  job.  Most jobs expect you to be in the office from  and depending on the company and the role it isnt that unusual to be working before or after those hours.  There really arent that many private sector jobs where you can make good money without also putting in more than a  hour work week.  With greater pay generally comes greater job responsibilities.  You might not be busy all the time but youll almost certainly have the occasional week where you hit  or  hours because of a major project or deadline.  ,college,clw5l4p,2,t5_2qh3z

2306854,0,t3_2ljhxe,If you havent already check with your schools financial aid office regarding the Federal Satisfactory Academic Progress SAP rules.  All schools that offer federal aid must publish and adhere to these policies.  The SAP policy contains two parts and you need to meet both standards to maintain eligibility theres also a third part but I dont think that applies to you.Part  Maintain a minimum GPA.  Generally you must keep an overall C average . to maintain federal eligibility. Your school could set a higher standard if they choose or they may allow first year students to have a lower gpa and then ramp it up over a few semesters. Part  Maintain a minimum Pace ratio.  Pace is defined as the percentage of credits you successfully complete out of all those you attempt.  At my school students must successfully complete twothirds of all the credits they attempt. Again a school could say new freshmen only have to complete  their first semester and then ramp it up.  If you withdraw and this is your first semester your pace would be .In your case if you fail the course it will reduce your GPA and your pace while withdrawing will just hurt your pace Ws dont typically affect a GPA.  However be sure to check if remedial courses are included in your schools SAP calculations.  They are excluded from the calculation at the college I work at since the student does not earn college credit for them anyway.  If you receive state or institutional money be sure to review the rules for maintaining eligibility as they are likely different than the federal rules.  If you speak to the financial aid office about withdrawing make sure you understand the impacts to the current semester and future semesters for federal state and institutional financial aid.  If you lose eligibility for federal aid that includes federal loans too.Good luck!,college,clwudu5,1,t5_2qh3z

2420377,0,t3_2n439a,Internships are key especially for CS. In interviews for full time positions they will always ask about any internships you have done and what you did during them. Therefore I would recommend getting an internship for the summer or as soon as possible.The good thing about internships is that they are internships. This means that people know that you do not know much. Dont worry about feeling under qualified because you should feel that way otherwise why would you be looking for an internship in the first place? You would be better off getting a full time position.Internship learning will probably vary on the internship. From my previous experience I learned a lot from my internships. Some of the things I learned from my internships I was able to use later on in my classes so that is also a big plus from having internships.Doing programming projects in your spare time will certainly boost your chances of getting a good internship but I would say that they are not required. Same idea for class material.Knowing only java is fine. As long as you know all the core concepts i.e memory accessing recursion loops OO concepts etc..As for working another year in food services I am not sure how that will impact your resume. It is defiantly good to show that you are at least doing some work but maybe they will ask themselves why you didnt get a CS internship with the plethora of them currently out that.,college,cmav8lz,1,t5_2qh3z

2509056,0,t3_2ocd3u,I dont think you are wrong at all. With social science you usually have to plan on going to grad school. And only a small percentage of students get admitted. I know it might not feel like this but you still have time to change your major. Sure you might of lost a semester but thats OK. As someone who graduated last Spring who was also very good in math I wish I picked a different major too. Although I like my job right now I wish I was a computer science major or focused more on going to grad school for healthcare. You dont know how valuable being good at math and science is. What helped me get into my career field was doing a lot of research selfstudying while I was in college and getting internships. My major isnt the best in the world but its also not the worst so my internships meant more than my degree. So if you feel like you need to take a semester off to research careers get experience to see what you enjoy and what your skills are then you should try and do that. With social sciences you usually need to plan on going to grad school or you need to network a lot and have various internships in different fields while you are in college to get a good job. Focus on a career field that you enjoy and will also give you a good return on investment then pick your major accordingly. You probably just didnt do enough research beforehand. My school even allowed their students to check books out see career counselors and be members of student organizations during a semester off. Its fine to take time off of school and to change your path. Its scary when you cant get a job. I definitely know some people from high school that graduated from college but they only have minimum wage jobs because they didnt research their major or careers enough. And they didnt research  how important internships research experience networking or volunteer work is. Edit I think Berkeley has a really great Career Center Website You can use it even if you are not a student there. And the U.S. Department of Labor has a really great Occupational Handbook that can help open your mind to various careers. Also research the qualifications you need to get into grad school if you havent done that already. Schools will often list the average admitted GPA GRE score and volunteerresearch hours on their departments websites. ,college,cmm2lgw,5,t5_2qh3z

3093070,0,t1_coia3yi,Thats not necessarily true and while it hasnt been for  years its less likely to be true now than ever before.Why? Because on average state legislatures have cut funding for public universities by  since . Meanwhile most private colleges engage in a practice called tuition discounting that far too many families just dont understand. What it means in essence is that the published price tag for a private school is the price only for a very wealthy kid with no merit scholarships at all.In practice the discount rate at a typical private college is close to  today. So a school with a K price tag will only cost K for an average student once you combine merit and needbased aid. That same student might receive no aid at all from the public university making the effective price much closer than youd think. Some students specifically highachievers from lowincome families will likely pay far less at a private school than a public one.So how do we get to cheaper from an average that is about the same or a bit higher? Graduation rates. As budgets have been slashed public schools have reduced faculty and course offerings. As a result many students are taking more than four years to finish because they cant get all the courses they need when they need them. At one state university near me the six year graduation rate is barely  while the nearby private college boasts a four year rate of .A cheaper school isnt cheaper it you have to go five years. Or more.Ultimately OP is right public schools are much more expensive than they once were and due to competition for good students many private schools are effectively cheaper than they once were even when their price tags keep going up. ,college,coilfwx,6,t5_2qh3z

In general they love classes like statics fluid mechanics circuits... those sick sick bastards. Physicists and engineers have a very different view of physics just as mathematicians and physicists have a very different view of mathematics. If OP is passionate about decomposing vectors or finding the net torque on a moment arm or other things at a high school physics level then theyd probably enjoy mechanical engineering. This is not to say that mechanical engineering is at the same difficulty level as high school physics hah you and every ME major out there wish far from it. However the problems you address in mechanical engineering compared to those you would address in physics  are more similar to those that you might encounter in a high school physics class just in much more depth and rigor. If on the other hand OP is passionate about things like dark matter dark energy inflation baryon asymmetry or any of these big problems you might hear about on TV then they would probably enjoy physics. These are topics that you get to in your upperlevel coursework as a physics major so I think it is important to be explicit with prospective students that these sort of things will not even be touched in their classes as an engineer.  In fact engineers at my school arent even required to take basic quantum mechanics at least not from the physics department I understand why but it still is a shame.TLDR if you are fascinated by things like dark matter dark energy the universe etc. you ought to major in physics but if you loved the physics you did in high school and couldnt care less about these ME is probably for you,college,cpnr038,3,t5_2qh3z

3601291,0,t3_31lqof,One really important thing that needs to be asked in order to properly help youHow committed are you to going to graduate school? And do you plan on pursuing a Masters or a PhD?If youre deadset on going to graduate school whatever university you choose to attend for your undergrad should set you up well lots of opportunities somewhere you can do very well relative to your peers etc. for graduate school. Prestige is much less important here because the degree that will matter is your masters or doctorate and the university granting that degree.If youre considering finishing with just a B.S. then you ought to give serious thought to the prestige of your undergrad institution. If youre not pursuing further degrees then your undergrad will be the university you list so name value is something to seriously consider. As if you didnt have enough things to mull over let me clue you in on why I asked the second question above about MS vs PhD. If you pursue a Masters youll almost always be required to pay for this. A PhD however will almost always be funded meaning you pay absolutely nothing. The Dean of my universitys Graduate Division explains it like this if you get into a PhD program in the sciences or social sciences and they dont fully fund you they dont want you go elsewhere. Please note that this shouldnt be confused with professional schools that grant degrees like MD or JD these are very different degrees than the PhD andyoull be asked to pay outtheass almost anywhere you would go for these.TLDR if you want just a bachelors think seriously about the prestige of the university you choose if you want a bachelors AND a masters the prestige of your undergrad matters less but youll have to pay for that masters program if you want a bachelors AND a PhD the prestige of your undergrad really doesnt matter so long as itll get you into your desired PhD program and your PhD will be paid for by the university,college,cq2rtym,3,t5_2qh3z

Advanced Composition.I was a math loving computer science student but I needed to take this advanced English class in community college to be equivelant to a  year english  program. This stupid requirement meant that CC students were taking a much more difficult class than is needed.I hated . The teacher acted as if we were not writing giant  paragraph essays but we were just break up the  middle paragraphs into several paragraphs a piece. Write your claim support it with evidence transition into next idea etc. It sounds great and easy in hindsight but it was hard having my writing be so micromanaged. Still I wanted an A. I did what I was told. Some of the worst papers I have ever written and yet I aced things. And then came English .Advanced Comp was unlike anything I had done before. We were told to write creative nonfiction for a popular audience. The teacher spent one class teaching logical fallacies. Another class was a three hour lecture on comma usage. We rearranged thr desks and discussed our essays in round table discussions. We were forced to read quite a bit for homework either from the essay book or from peer papers we took home. Most importantly we were allowed to break from a five paragraph formula and experiment with our own structures. For the first time in my writing life I felt free. We had essays due every week and honestly I love writing now. Research citations etc. Good stuff.I am confident I could now ace a GRE essay section as well as turn in an historical research paper that would blow a teacher out of the water. I am actually considering writing a book at one point possibly a nonfiction about computers or some science. The teacher was that good for me. The class had us write around  pages of material. Looking back that is a good amount and like any CSmath guy I learned by doing. I understand that communication skills can be an inherent gift but fine tuning them is key to unlocking that potential.After that  hour comma lesson the teacher said that there are no further excuses. For every comma that is missing or unnecessary in our final  page paper one point off.The internet social media and especially Reddit looks like horror to me. When you consider sentence fragments and comma usage you realize who the other trained writers are. I can spot a good writer on Reddit instantly because of that.It was a great class!,college,crrpjwx,2,t5_2qh3z

She is constantly annoyed that her grades dont reflect her hard work but rather the easy grades handed out by harmfully generous  instructors.While I think she is being overly critical of a community college environment she makes a good point. And in my experience its a matter of being excited for free points or being irritated at more busy work. For you I would suggest not doing it as class participation will be based on authentic student effort and interest in your class.

4356568,0,t1_csgnk4w,I think this is really great advice. Often I hear people complaining that they study insert ridiculous number hours per week and still get unsatisfactory grades and my advice in response is always that theyre overworking themselves and need to relax a bit. People need to understand that if youve pushed yourself to the brink forcing yourself to study more will often be ineffective especially if were talking about studying vs. sleeping for a test the next day.But also as you point out it has a lot to do with each persons ability to retain information. Someone might spend  to  hours per week on a class that their friend spends only  or  hours probably because of differing ability to retain the material and that is totally fine. But I worry very seriously for the person who tries to spend  or  hours per week on the same class.,college,csgpveo,3,t5_2qh3z

4380774,0,t3_3b6j4d,It really depends on what you want to do with the degree. If Im not mistaken applied math is essentially the math teacher degree. thats the way I interpreted the description for the UW degree I was reading at least The stats is well stats. Specialising is always good so if you want to do something statistics related thats probably the the you want and you can take all the electives you want. Math is a relatively small major as much as I can tell credit wise. Im doing the standard degree myself. My first major is psychology so Ill have all the stats classes Ill need. The standard option seems to be what I want because the psychology degree will give me my teaching credentials for the high school level. So I mean really you need to figure put what it is you want to do after college. Math is definitely a good subject to learn but the way the system is set up its a way into a career path. The different degrees will get you different career paths. I would advocate taking another subject as a minordouble major. Something like computer science or something or another subject that uses math like psychology. That way you have all of the math skills but know an area of study that has more direct application for of those skills. ,college,csjg5ou,4,t5_2qh3z

The point of having a breadth of classes is to get you to think about things differently. Those are the skills you should be taking away. When you ask yourself what did I learn the answer should not be a vomiting of bulletpointed facts. You cant build new things by rehashing the old. You have to figure out how to tie these seemingly disparate ideas and ways of thinking  together. Now for the facts you need to know for a skill or specialty practice. The only way to get something to stick in your longterm memory is to make it important to you. One way to do that is by using it in every way you can.

For example if you all plan on cooking and eating at home as often as possible you can assume that the total cost will be approx.  per week. But if youll just be eating all your meals out and just want snacks for home buy the snacks you want for a week and their cost will be your budget for snacks.As for brands once you have the list go to the store as a group and see what brands the store has and decide as a group what one you want to get and make sure to write it down. If you dont write it down someone is going to forget.If youre really organized and you all can decide on a set list of stuff to get you could type it up get a cheap laminating kit and laminate the list and then use a whiteboard marker or paperclips to mark the things you need when you run out so that what the person whos turn it is goes shopping they dont have to waste time looking to see if you really need everything on the list or not so you dont end up with five jars of peanut better because it was on the list even though the jar you had was still half full.And as for money once you have that list have a budget for the shopping every week and have an order for whos going shopping when you can decide if everyone is going to give a set amount to the person doing the shopping that week or if theyll just pay the full amount when they go shopping if that makes sense.Hope this helped!,college,cudsmlo,2,t5_2qh3z

But here is the limited info I haveI dont know what your financial situation is but Id say apply for financial aid anyway.  I didnt think I would get any aid for my current college but I ended up getting quite a bit.  I also know that if you have a decent ACT score which if you could get it up in the s like you said they have a scholarshipa where UT will give you a decent amount of money so long as you work something like  hours a week during the year.  During my visit there I talked with a student who was on this scholarship.  It was specifically for out of state students I believe.  Unfortunately I dont remember the name of the scholarship.  Id recommend applying to UT filling out their scholarship form making sure you mark every one you qualify for and seeing what they offer you.  Then you can see if you will be able to make it happen.  I am really sorry I couldnt be more helpful.  I was in the exact same situation two years ago as an outofstate student but then I decided to go to a different school and never finished figuring out how to pay for UT.

They will be staffed by students who have passed these courses and done well who can give you honest advice about how to do so. It is NOT SHAMEFUL to do so. It does not mean you have failed. It does not mean you are stupid. I ran a writing center for four years at two different schools and our smartest students hung out in there! Eventually we hired some of them too. Organic is HARD yo. And thats okay. Lots of people learn it by making little models all the time so if you dont have one of those kits yet you should get one. When I took Calc II I had a hell of a time because the tests were given to all sections at once and the same test was given to all sections. Why was this a problem? It turns out my teacher was sort of weak in some areas so while I could follow him and the homework just fine when another prof wrote the exam I was screwed. The learning center saved me by filling in the blanks. Its also okay to reduce your load take five years or anything else you need to do to preserve your sanity. Have you joined clubs? Are you still doing hobbies? Sanity time that is not partying is often under valued in college. As a prof I have two activities a week choir and Zumbatapjazz that NOBODY is allowed to screw with.

You need to practice over and over and over all the problems until its second nature and you can explain it to someone like a Khan Academy video.   Take practice problems from the homework the textbook class exercises class examples online problems etc. Just do them over and over! Memorize formulas with flash cards and such a good method is to look them over every night or so. Make sure you can explain the whys of the formulas as well so its not just a random combination of variables.   Pretty much how I do every math class so far have gotten all As and Bs in classes like Calc I amp II Discrete Math Linear Algebra Differential Equations Statistics and now working on my last class Numerical Analysis for the math minor.

5678257,0,t3_3st8sc,Sorry for the copy paste from another post of mine but Im lazy I just started going back to college in Fall of . Im . I work full time and am going to school full time. Its hard but manageable. It will be different for everyone though. I dont need to study much yet. Im pretty good at taking lecture notes and taking the tests that way. I also do any and all extra credit that might be offered. Every little bit helps. So far after  credits Im rocking a . GPA.My work is very labor intensive and there would be no time to study at work.My advice...ease into it. Full time school and part time work if you can and gradually work up your hours at your job. Everyone learns differently. Some people need more study time than other people do.Minimize your time on campus if you can. Try to take some courses online. Itll allow yourself to be more flexible with your work requirements. Try to schedule all your classes on just a couple days. This past summer I was on campus  days a week. Im taking  classes in both of my universities summer terms.  and Noon time slots on Mondays and Wednesdays. Each summer semester Im taking an elective online as well. Right now Im on campus  days a week with  classes. One of them is online and is already finished for the semester. I have  evening classes on Monday and a pair of classes back to back on TuesdayThursday. Get a solid schedule and really try to optimize it to minimize unnecessary commuting or breaks in your day.If you are going to a larger school where multiple teachersprofessors teach the same class use sites like RateMyProfessor.com or koofers.com to find out which teachers are most liked by their students give lots of extra credit or base most of the class grade off of tests if you are a solid test taker...I am. These sites shine the brightest when you are picking your electives. Find electives not in your major that dont require much work. Here is a review for a course Im taking online this summer.gt Great online class easy...easy...easy.  homework assignments.  quizzes which are open book because its an online class. and  discussions. thats it. easy gen ed.Another course Im taking in the fall...gt Easiest class ive taken at ....... If you can read follow directions and manage your time you will get an A with absolutely zero time spent outside of class. You follow a book of directions to do everything in SAP and take a few quizzes and tests. ....... is amazing and know his stuff inside and out. Great Professor.Prioritize your study time but if you really dont feel like studying...dont force it. I dont believe that forcing yourself to study when you really arent in the mood is good for learning. Take a break play a game go to a movie or go on a date. All work and no play will cause burn out quickly I feel that Im rambling...its almost  am and I really should be in bed but this is my week off between spring and summer semesters!Good luck!,college,cx0xzkn,2,t5_2qh3z

One thing in some institutions is to take an incomplete. This means you can postpone the deadlines for your work until you get through this immediate crisis. Or a professor might be able to stream line some of the processes. We do after all know the answers to the tests and the essays. We have an idea of what you have to write. By leaning on your instructors in a time of crisis you can get immediate help that lets you skate through the work much more easily. If there was serious family trauma you might be able to do a late withdraw which will let you drop the classes youre still out the money but you save your GPA so you can take the winter break to get your head on straight. Basically email everyone. Tell everyone. Not the details but the bare bones. Tell them you are falling apart. There are  escape hatches built into college because this happens ALL the fucking time. We dont want students breaking. We want to give them options and support and a way out. But we cant do anything unless we know whats going on.

6022910,0,t3_3xywjv,Eastern Michigan grad school alum here!! I graduated in May and I had a wonderful experience working and learning at EMU.  The people I worked with and studied with are great my professors were awesome and knowledgeable and Ypsi is truly a neat little community!  The connections that I made at EMU I will carry with me for a lifetime and I wouldnt trade my experience for anything!That being said there are a couple things you should be aware of EMU is a political minefield.  Faculty are stuck in their ways and rigid disciples of union regulations.  The administration is riddled with high turnover lack of experience and selfish decision making. Literally every decision made serves some sort of selfinterest. Student interests are always going to come at a second to that. This isnt because they are bad people but thats the culture that has developed in the wake of highturnover among university officials.  As a student you can still expect to be supported and receive a decent experience but dont expect favors for the sake of favors.  The caveat to that is that it provides a really unique and beneficial realworld experience particularly for graduate students and graduate assistants because those are the issues that crop up in actual businesses and organizations.  I learned how to navigate that type of environment through my experience at EMU and Im better off because of it. The governing structure is currently in a period of complete turmoil. At the end of last semester President Susan Martin resigned and took a job at San Jose state.  Last month the Interim President Kim Schatzel resigned and took a job at Towson. This semester there have been several admin departments that have lost their directors to resignation. Finally this semester the faculty announced a vote of no confidence in the board of regents because of their involvement with EAA just google it.  Basically EMUs governing body is a total shitshow right now. Finally crime in Ypsi and on campus has seen a significant increase within the past semester.  There have been several armed robberies and attempted muggings on and around campus so things are a little spooky.  That said it probably wouldnt affect you so much if youre commuting from Canada each day.  These things are happening at am type hours.Thats all I have time to type out right now but if you want to PM me Id be happy to share more about the ups and downs of life at EMU! Good luck in your decision making process! ,college,cy94k3h,3,t5_2qh3z

I actually did A LOT of practice problems went to my teachers office hours for help etc. Sometimes all you need is a better approach. I learned to prioritize my studies versus skipping class and binge watching shows on netflix which i still do just not as much. Throughout my entire semester of Calc  my second time around I was doing somewhat decent in the class and because I studied my ass off for the final i ended up doing so good that it boosted me up a whole letter grade.

I dont think your issue is living at home so much as it just your personality no offense. Without knowing how your family structure is disciplinary levels etc. its hard to give sound advice on how often you should go out with friends and come home late or not at all. If they understand you though and realize that socializing is a big part of college Im sure theyd understand why youre coming home after midnight. Try talking to them. One of the biggest red flags Im seeing in this post is that youre willing to get rid of that free ride in return of being able to live in a dorm of some sort to talk to more people. But did you know you can do the same exact thing while still living at home? All you have to do is put yourself out there. Try not to go right home after class. Go sit in the commons area the library and do homework read magazines and start trying to talk to people you see around you. If theres another area with a pool table or something go hangout around there. Ask if you can play the winner and theres a good in to learning names and meeting new people. Check out some of the clubs your school has as I know not all of them are private and youre more than welcome to drop in on certain days. One last thing go out with your friends when they invite you.

Profs can grade however they want really. Students who should fail end up passing. Students that should pass might fail. Students who have done Clevel work will get an A. Students who work hard to get an A might end up with a B. AND the most important lesson in all this to me is if you genuinely focus on your own learning and demonstrating that learning on assignments and tests and intentionally drive out of your mind how others are performing you will get what you need out of the class. If you put energy into thinking about how others are doing you will be distracted and unhappy in nearly all situations. It doesnt matter if youre doing better or worse than somebody else.And really this is a lesson on the rest of life.

This was a really pleasant experience especially for many of the introductory level science courses I took. Instead of a  person general chemistry class I only had  other students and the professor knew everybodys names. We also had no curves which was in my opinion very nice. You got what you deserved but the tests werent made ungodly difficult so that a certain number of people would get destroyed or so class averages would be . I hear that this can be the case at Northwestern which doesnt make sense to me. At a school with so many hard working people as was the case with my last school if the test average is an F uncurved then there is either something wrong with the instruction or the test. It was really nice to go to a class and know that you didnt have to worry about being on the good side of a curve. You just had to prepare and try your best. Although it did make low grades especially crushing. That D you just got on your math exam? Its still going to be a D at the end of the semester. As far as larger classes go my  person class was one of those lecture classes that seemed like a myth to me. I probably looked as clueless as a freshman on my first day there. It felt completely unnatural and was very weird coming from such a small environment. Luckily the class material was fun and the class was easy. I knew itd be a nice introduction to a large lecture class so thats why I took it. In the future I intend to avoid such classes. Although for the most part thats not a problem. All of my major classes are  or less depending on what level of course you take. I think my classes next quarter starts late March are    and . As a journalism social sciences humanities student you shouldnt have much of a problem getting small class sizes. The only courses with really big class sizes are in economics and STEM from what I understand. Although as a journalism student I think you need to take quite a few courses as in  out of the  courses you need to graduate   in psychology which might be on the larger end. Overall the student faculty ratios were the same . This means that both schools had the potential of providing very very small classes but Northwestern definitely has a higher bound in class size since class limits vary so much and arent universally capped at . My grades so far are actually marginally better at Northwestern but its really splitting hairs. If you want to get straight As at a LAC or Northwestern its definitely possible at either. They just require some navigating a lot of hard work and quickly understanding what class sizes and types you perform best in. ,college,d0g34yt,2,t5_2qh3z

6883139,0,t3_4a0q81,Im an environmental science student but I spend a lot of time around wildlife bio majors as well as some zoology majors. First of all these two fields are closely related so I wouldnt stress out too much about it. Either one could lead you into careers in working with animals but they will differ slightly depending on what school you decide on.My understanding is that wildlife biology is focused more on conservation ecology which involves studying the ecological functions and behaviors of organisms in the wild as well as population dynamics and genetics. This major would likely lead you into a career in research. Zoology is more handson in that it is more organismoriented which means you would be spending more time studying animal form and function on the individual level rather than with regard to populations in the wild. If you want to go into animal care and rehabilitationzookeeping zoology might be a better fitMost importantly I would recommend that you apply to schools with strong biologyecology departments. Whichever major you decide you will start to get a better idea of what you really want to do after youve started taking more classes in this field. Since these two majors are so closely related it wont be a big deal if you change your mind and want to switch. You seem to know generally what you want to do which will help you a lot in deciding where to apply and will also make it easier to narrow down your path of study once you start college. ,college,d0wiq1u,3,t5_2qh3z

The CS specific classes of course. And there are some links between the fields where it can help. Lets take computer science and the  core classes from high school Englishliterature sure the connection is weak but strong English and literature skills helps with writing documentation and being able to follow grammatical rules and structures which in concept are similar to learning different languages and their unique syntaxes.  Mathematics informatics and software development are very strong mathematics studies. Youll often need to apply knowledge from calculus and the various formulas and equations youve learned about in creating a program. This part varies a great deal on the application of the software you design. Aerospace game engine work and electrical systems applications require lots of math whereas business solutions might not need so much.  Science the scientific process and learning about how things work help prepare you for learning the creative process and how things can be solved.  History no application here. So while the applications are weak please consider how being educated in various fields can make you more educated outside of your career. In terms of voting political issues and making informed decisions when needed. ,college,d1b65dh,2,t5_2qh3z

Turn off your phone when in class or studying.  Check your messages twice a day and respond then.  But basically be really busy studying and making friends so you dont have to listen to your parents crap.You dont mention your school choices or cost but if you get offered a good school that would let you be NOT reliant on much money from your parents consider taking that offer.  Because I could picture a scenario where you empty your pockets to pay for two years and your parents leave you high and dry.  Try to avoid putting yourself at their mercy.As for Physics... Its not the easiest major to get a job with only a Bachelors.  Same thing with Biology and Chemistry.  Funnily enough its easier to get a job with a bachelors in anything if its got engineering added on.... So Chemical Engineering has better job prospects than Chemistry.

The majority of UAs ties are in the south and especially the tuscaloosabirmingham area which makes sense but if youre from the north like me finding an internship near your house in the summer could be difficult. They push coop harder than internships and there are good reasons for that easier to get because many start in the fall companies are likely to hire or refer you elsewhere after graduation if you work at a large company you can get placed in different departments each coop term and see what you like the most etc. Theres an office that helps you through the whole process from resume making to interview tips and they hold coop and job fairs for engineering every semester.

7277348,0,t3_4ei3cj,University of Southern California k vs NYUStern k I am from New York and I am interested in business. At USC I applied and got into the Dornsife College of Letters Arts and Sciences with EconomicsMathematics as my major. However if I were to end up at USC I would definitely look into transferring into their Marshall School of Business. At Stern I would be pursuing a Business degree with concentrations in Finance and Global Business. One of the biggest dilemmas I am having is choosing between undertaking a true college experience at USC or being a commuter student at NYU where many seem to joke about their lack of community. Also I would ideally like to work on the East Coast following my undergraduate years and so I was wondering what implications attending USC would have on my job opportunities. Lastly the financial aid package NYU provided me with is mostly made up of loans whereas I received more Gift AidGrant money at USC adding on at USC there are a variety of inschool scholarships that students can apply to yearly in order to bring down the cost whereas at NYU no such type of extra help seems to exist.

They had a lot of required bull shit classes about how to do research in kinesiology the social aspects of sports etc. Outside the required lab sciences and biomechanicsexs phys the interesting classes were all electives. Classes on movement clinical experience technology were not required which I disagree with. One of my biggest regrets of college is not enrolling in a  year DPT program. Because now Im graduated with a  year degree have to take a year off for GRE CSCS and apply to  year DPT programs. I got into a few year programs as a senior in high school but they were too expensive. Exercise science degree requires some sort of graduate level course work to get a good job. The main point that I would emphasize looking at an Exercise Science degree is the clinical hours. My school did not require any clinical hours to graduate. The class was an elective. Most kids got hours on their own over the summersemester but its tough. Make sure your program requires clinical hours in both outpatientinpatient settings. Its a pain to set up and do during the semester but it should be an easy A in a credit course. I still plan on going to PT school after a year off working in a PT office.

Anything you learn in an online class you could probably learn without taking the class. That said its probably gonna be best for you to take the online class. I recommend not doing it over the summer. I took Spanish  over the summer  days per week  hours per day and it was super fast paced. There was a chapter test and a quiz every week and also online homework every week that probably took about an hour a day. I just got really behind on the online homework and got knocked down from an A to a B totally reasonable and I didnt deserve higher for doing all the homework in the last week when it was way past due. The teacher was amazing though and it was a good experience. If it were all online I would have regretted taking the class. But thats just me. Despite being somewhat antisocial I much prefer learning in person to online. Another option would be doing something like rduolingo to learn on your own time then taking a proficiency test with the school.

7942061,0,t3_4nvkx9,. Go to class. Some classes have attendance requirementsrarely because the instructor enjoys taking attendance. Its because going to class greatly increases your odds of doing well.. Take notes by hand. research has shown that people retain info much better when writing than typing. Ive permitted students computers in the class and then gave them a questionnaire at the semesters endevery single student said they distracted themselves and preferred banned computers.. Create a schedule. As a full time student youre taking at least  classes. Like many students youll probably have a second job as well. You may also want to join clubs. Map out your weekly schedule so you know when to be where. Make sure to have approximately  hours of study or class work time  days a weekstudying every day for smaller amounts of time retains SO MUCH more info than a  hour session in one day.. Put all your major projects and tests into your phone calendar at the beginning of the semester. Shit happens and we all forget due dates. Have them in your calendar with alarms to help you spend enough time prepping and then showing up on time.. If you live on campus have snack bars in your room to eat in the morning. Then eat your meals at off times on campus. Will save you so much time from having to stand in line.. Take a tour of your library. Besides books and electronic journal articles which you should know how to access college libraries have so many resources. Big schools especially. But some small schools have agreements with the larger university in town so make sure you know how yours works.. Bathe regularly do laundry and clean your place. Itll make you physically feel better and also keep you healthy. So many students get sick from living in close quarters eating crappy diets and not taking care of themselves.. Treat your college classes like a jobshow up and do the work on time. . Have fun and try different classes. Most of your professors and instructors are smart people who enjoy learning.

8039375,0,t3_4p9w92,You know what you need to do you need to study. Ok but how?Set aside time everyday for studying. Mathematics is all about doing the homework problems sometimes multiple times and figuring it out. Talk with your instructors. Go to their office hours and go over some problems you are having trouble on. Make some friends in the class and try to get into or start a study group. It is very helpful to explain to others or have someone explain something to you as opposed to just working on it silently on your own. To help from feeling overwhelmed just focus on the one problem you need to do. If you think about an assignment like I have to do all  of these problems tonight you are going to feel overwhelmed and disinclined to start. If you instead think of it like I am just going to start the first problem and see where I go from there that is much more manageable. Go see your counselors at your college for further help and guidance if you need someone else to help you out. Sometimes negative thinking patterns can get in your way. Therapy is good. ,college,d4jp8z7,3,t5_2qh3z

Richmond and Boston College are both quite well regarded particularly at the undergraduate level. Georgia Tech might have the best scienceengineering programs out of all of these but I wouldnt go there if STEM isnt your thing. Tulane is quite well regarded especially in the south.Tulane is a pretty decent party school but the main draw might be that its in New Orleans which is basically a party city. Itll be quite hot and humid perhaps uncomfortably so but idk what Brisbane weather is like while youre there. But still a lot of fun.ASU is in Phoenix which is a large cool if somewhat uncultured city. Its basically dropped in the middle of the southwestern deserts. ASU itself is a huge university and famous as a party school. The weather in Phoenix will probably be FC while youre there a very dry heat.Otherwise you might want to look at the big universities in big cities. Theyll probably have a decent party scene and if not at least therell be stuff to do. Examples of this include the University of Washington Seattle Washington University St. Louis University of Texas Austin obv. Austin etc. You might also consider Stony Brook or Rutgers. Probably not what youre looking for in terms of party schools but they are at least the closest to New York City.

From there I narrowed my list down to some of the top big schools and a few other smaller reach schools i.e. Ivy League. Once I didnt get into any Ivy League schools... In fact once I didnt get into  out of the  schools I applied to I began to weigh pros and cons. My school University of Wisconsin is a perfect balance between great academics and an incredible atmosphere. Some schools I got into were slightly higher ranked all within the top  range so not a huge gap really but I just couldnt pass up the benefits UW offered outside of the classroom. The  college football town in America and a beautiful city of K people surprise surprise feverish school spirit and an incredible history made my decision for me. I dont regret anything  I love it. ,college,d5jv1bm,4,t5_2qh3z

Get involved with some clubs form a study group go out drinking every now and again and before too long you will have new friends.

First off you can take the test again if you do fail. Knowing that can help with the stress. But overall the test really isnt hard and once the nervousness passes its okay. Second Check and see what classes you cant take until you pass. I was allowed to take everything but math until I could pass. But in the end youll probably pass its a really simple test.

Cut the corners every week so I can flip to my section. Google Drive copy of my PDF textbooks any projects Im working on and the syllabus. Mostly cause I use the school computer lab for projects. Its about  a month for  GB if you ran out of free space. Before school add in Google Calendar all the school events as all day things ie Reading Week. If its a timed event its still listed as all day but like Free Pancake day  am   pm at gym Once registered do the same with class times as reoccurring events. Add in  hour blocks of study time when my work schedule is posted. I have all my school stuff on a single calender but you can use a colour for class. I also check and schedule the physics colloquium at my school and another every  months or so because theirs often cool ones.  I also have a grey calendar for cool stuff to do I have not yet committed to. This is great for adding concerts or events and everything you are mildly interested in that way when you call friends you can be like hey wanna see that thing next week. First week of class scan all syllabuses and type up all the assignments and readings and make a master checklist. Its tapped on my door. I just like seeing it crossed off.This year Im using Cal and Any.do for to dos and planning to enter all the assignments into it. Basically break up all major projects into steps and book time for them. Last year I just used Google calendar and put all day events with what I was doing but it was messy.I also have a plastic folder for hand outs. College has very little actual hand outs.I made shortcuts to my textbooks on my tablet and used a syncing program to back up certain important drive folders to the SD card too. Mostly ebooks. Theres also citation apps that are awesome. Try to find one while starting and essay. Youll love it. Anki Droid does flashcards but I never did well with flash cards as a study trickHave doubles of everything important and fairly cheap.

8801498,0,t1_d75l0ps,Sounds like you just have a very particularly hard semester. Those are tough classes so dont get to worried...it wont always be like this. One option in the future is to try and balance out your semesters a little bit more. It wont always work out but sometimes you can sneak in a few easy classes. I had one semester  science courses  labs and a tutorial plus my undergraduate thesis study and I was very tired and overworked by the end. But its only  months...not too long in the grand scheme of things. Came out of it with As so it is possible to work hard have a difficult semester and get a good GPA  you might just have to make some sacrifices for a short while  emphasis on the short. As others have said another option is to prioritize. Focus in on the classes that mean the most to your major and really try to excel there. I know you are aiming for scholarships so you have to keep a high GPA. Prioritizing doesnt mean sacrificing grades but it means knowing when and where to put effort into a class. Dont spend  hours doing an assignment worth . Put in the right amount of effort for grade percentage. So here are my followup recommendations Prioritize your work so that you focus on what really matters in each class. Assignments and tests that are worth more should take more of your time. Dont waste time studying or working for hours on assignments worth less than  of your grade. Learn to study more efficiently  think about trying to speed read the chapters or skim to get the main points in history. In calculusengineering just focus on the diversity of problems once you have mastered one move on to the next type. Dont spend all day reworking problems. Take advantage of a writing center your professor or TA or study group to help you get through those essays more quickly. Sometimes talking through something with a friendprofessor can really get your mind working and give you great ideas to write on.  Try and look at your next semester and see if you can lighten the load or rearrange some classes to give yourself a well deserved break. ,college,d75tjnr,3,t5_2qh3z

8834940,0,t3_516irx,HiIm currently a student in the Johns Hopkins program for medical and biological illustration. Medical illustration is a valid field that is growing every day with the use of new technology and new scientific discoveries. Those that say why not use old art or use pictures maybe dont realize that there is an actual person or team of persons creating those medical animations illustrations in textbooks or exhibitions for museums.If you are seriously interested in the field go check out ami.org and browse through all the information. Breaking into the field without graduate school training is tough but doable. If you take that route I highly recommend becoming a certified medical illustrator CMI. This certification requires portfolios and tests and shows potential clients that you know your stuff. Anyone can copy old medical illustrations but employers are looking for scientists who are also artists. They need illustrators that can innovate. Another option is to consider biological illustration without the medical component. Its much easier to get clients this way and to freelance because you usually dont need a degree. If youre set on medical art I personally would recommend a graduate program just so you can learn the conventions and standard practices for doing medical illustrations. Graduate school of any type is pricey and the programs in North America are extremely competitive but I do think that its worth it. They also do their very best to get you a job in the field after graduating with almost a  percent success rate. If you have any more questions feel free to ask! I love this field and I think its the perfect mix of science and art. And as for those disgusting dissections those are the most fun to draw ,college,d79u35h,29,t5_2qh3z

8862741,0,t3_51lavr,Definitely apply to scholarships. Im a  year old woman who went back to school at  and I had  of my  years at CC paid by scholarships and just got a full ride to university. Having a child and being a nontraditional student can help you a great deal. I dont have kids myself but I have received every scholarship Ive applied for so far and I think it has a lot to do with me stressing my financial need in my essay. Personally I had to work fulltime for my first year at school and the only reason I was able to stop is that I got scholarships so I make sure to mention that in my essays. Scholarship boards seem to understand that and have empathy in my experience. Maintaining a high GPA while working and raising a child is impressive and looks great on scholarship applications. A lot of older students I meet seem to think that scholarships arent an option for them and while some are definitely geared more toward people fresh out of high school there are many that just want to help a student in need. Most of the scholarships Ive received have been through my school so see if you can check in with the financial aid office or something to see what may be available. Most schools have a scholarship section on their webpage too. Another thing to consider is that your financial aid may go way up once you quit working fulltime. When I was making slightly less than you working fulltime I got next to nothing in grants but as soon as I cut down to parttime work I ended up getting most of my tuition covered. This let me use my scholarship money to cover living expenses and save for my summer class tuition. ,college,d7d6dil,4,t5_2qh3z

However the classes only get more difficult at the university level. By having the skills to work through a difficult course and end up with a solid B or even an A.

8985225,0,t1_d7rbdhl,Awesome! Its a very quick read I read it in one weekend. I think youll like it. A tip you could start using right now is to only spend time studying the things you dont understand. Right now I am studying for a music history exam coming up this week. I looked at the study guide she put online and attempted to explain all the conceptsfacts out loud to myself. Whenever I got to a piece of info I stumbled over or could not explainremember I wrote it down. Then with those things I made my own study guide writing down definitions or other information that helped me learn the concepts. The main thing is that I didnt waste time studying things I already knew.For example my list of things I knew included stuff like Latin vs. vernacular Gregorian chant and plainchant Renaissance instrument classification bas vs. haut and the Council of Trent recommendations for sacred music. I was able to explain all of those to myself easily and with little or no struggle to recall. However stuff I needed to work on was neumes and early musical notation the musical Ars Nova the motet the French chanson and the composer Josquin. And a few other things. So those are the things I worked on. So instead of rereading all of the chapters and reviewing all of the slides and all of my notes from class I only looked at the material relevant to the things I needed help on. I googled a few things as well and looked up YouTube examples of the motet and the chanson. All of those resources were available to me to help me study not just rereading notes and the textbook. I took a break and then went back to the study guide and was able to easily explain all the concepts. I will do the explain out loud process again tonight and tomorrow just in case. Now heres the thing that entire studying session took maybe  minutes including breaks for reddit and facebook. Thats it!Granted part of it is learning concepts the first time around and using study time only to review and refresh and not actually learn material for the first time but the book I told you about will talk more about that.  ,college,d7rvwrh,2,t5_2qh3z

Im still her facebook friend but she only ever posts things pertaining to her sorority her Greek letters are all over her page and she only posts pictures of her sisters and the occasional frat party. She was a really talented allstate trumpet player but she quit band for Greek life which I found to be a huge shame. I know its reductive too compare sororitiesfrats to cults but I do think that a certain kind of person can get unhealthily caught up in them. I also have friends who are the types who get drunk every weekend. The transition from high school to college can be really fucking hard on people especially if theyre far from home.

According to that article. Further more they recommend you just get the best scores you can in a major you enjoy.A History degree has huge benefits to a potential law school graduate. Experience in writing strong papers research a fundamental understanding of the significance of eventsall things that would benefit a potential law student and someone who uses a law degree.I think youd be fine getting your history major and using it to catapult you into law school get your law degree and the pursue that federal agent career if you want. Who knows maybe something else excites you on the way maybe you find a passion for trial law or paralegal research. Either way those are all very marketable skills.I think you just need to find the right way to apply your passions rather than being like  of the kids in your college and wishing you could major in art and paint for a living. ,college,d8h646h,0,t5_2qh3z

For example if youre told that a gas behaves as a perfect gas then you know you can use the perfect gas law which is very important information to have. Then you list the things youre being asked to find out. Depending on what topic the question is centred on youll know which equations are available for you to use. Then you need a bit of creativity.

9762426,0,t1_dagcdp0,Thats exactly how being a land lord works. You own the housing and provide it to others at a mark up.  You can argue ethics if you want but its been a mainstream business model for literally centuries back when families with large estates might lease out their unused summer homes during the winter.In answer to your question the benefit is autonomy. In your scenario if the other  students leave the last student is still on the hook for month. In a perfect world where everyone pay and obeys their lease this is fine. In a world of college students this doesnt usually work out so cleanly.Offering individual ownership of a  section of the house through lease agreements allows people to burden their own responsibility with less dependency on others. ,college,dagfq2u,1,t5_2qh3z

Many of them are dealing with switching careers a year or two after university because theyre unhappy which ends up making a lot of the time and effort they put into major A for naught.  So basically many of them are just pushing breaking the news to their parents later in life that they will not be doing what their parents had hoped.Its difficult to tell him what to do because his parents probably have put a lot of consideration into planning for his college education and probably wouldnt think twice paying for his education.

If you find you dont like programming but still like computers you should maybe think about a major in Computer Information Systems instead of Computer Science. It has less math less programming but deals with the interconnectivity of computers through networking and servers and operating systems.

10333215,0,t1_dcf3qr9,Ill try to keep it short but fair warning I tend to be wordy lolI went to the  year with the intention to never leave DC. Struggled a LOT my first year massive reality check for me. I was miserable broke depressed and failed out of college. I petitioned for my loans back and spent my third semester Fall  on academic probation. Struggled a LOT but made it through. The following spring I only took  classes and did amazingly well. But I found out I was behind and would have to take an overload semester to make up and I wasnt keen on it. Parents suggested I transfer but stubborn me wasnt going to throw in the towel. Found out that I wasnt offered housing for the following year and my parents again suggested I come home. I was so stubborn I was looking at vans to buy and live in. In the last weeks of the semester I admitted defeat cried a whole lot and decided I would have to transfer. I really avoided the topic until it was too late to transfer to any other  year so the local community college was my best option. There was a lot of debate on whether I should do a semester or a year but we settled on a year just for simplicity. There was debate on whether to go for my associates or just take classes that would transfer. I found out that if I had my Associates of Arts all of my GenEds at my new  year would be waived saving a lot of time. I know that works for a handful of schools in my state so check before you assume anything lol. So here I am  classes away from my AA in May and then off to college again in the fall. Finances played a big part too. My family is white average middle class so we didnt qualify for much aid that I really needed. My first college was  K a year and I had a  a year merit scholarship. Weve been slowly paying one of my loans as we go so I have K in loans from that school. At the community college we paid out of pocket for my first semester maybe K and change. We did payments but it was a big strain. This spring we took out a loan for K and change to cover it. The college Im looking at comes to about K a year on the price tag. A massive difference than my first. Ill be there for about . years  if I decide to tack on a minor. Its a massive amount of money but drops in the bucket compared to previous. Were also banking on some merit scholarships from them a little aid outside of that and getting not awful loans. Wow OK that still ended up massively long. There was a few other factors that really weighed my choices and decisions but those are the biggies. Let me know if you have any questions though Id love to help! ,college,dcfbsra,2,t5_2qh3z

10384041,0,t3_5odgwb,Can confirm. In my personal experience advisors are generally useless. In the past I have had to know the curriculum and chosen path in all of its entirety before the appointment. Which might be a given to some but others not so much. My impression was that your designated advisor should know your curriculum too along with various paths of that curriculum you can take. Maybe it was naive of me to think that but low and behold they dont know curriculums very well. I was a transfer student going for Dietetics I had already taken the Chemistry needed at CC. My advisor just kind of overlooked the fact that my credits did in fact transfer thus having me enroll in Chemistry at IU being a transfer I thought I knew how to use amp read my universitys online portal but I didnt. The last advisor I had showed me incorrect information!! Science is much more difficult at University and I didnt do as well. So I was forced to switch majors. Then when I went to meet with her to switch ...Me So Im going to pursue Community Health since yall kind of fkd me over. Advisor That would be your best betMe I know. Thanks for that clarification. Do you have any other suggestions to bring to the table? No? Okay cool! The good thing is that a lot of the Dietetics curriculum overlaps with the Community Health thus giving me an extra minor.Advisor Oh really? Thats great!... My thought was.. shouldnt she be telling me this info that Im telling her? Every advisor meeting I have gone through I have led our discussion. I thought these experiences would become more tolerable when going to University... They werent. Dare I say they have become worse maybe due to the higher volume of students at Uni than CC. Sometimes I need you guys to clarify school stuff for me. Thanks Reddit. Edit USE YOUR PROFESSORS!!,college,dcl3fxc,1,t5_2qh3z

10705041,0,t3_5sul4l,The best advice I can give you because you are committed to and love your major is to work on your time management in specific ways so that you dont end up feeling like you are caught floating in a sea of obligations with no way out. This may seem like an obvious idea heck maybe you already do something similar but I would suggest keeping a notebook and writing down each day what you absolutely need to do that day along with some things that you could work on but maybe arent as urgent. Mine usually end up looking something like Go to x class  eat  work on y  work on z Go to b class etc. And work in breaks and such as needed. Since lots of homework can be centered around huge amounts of reading if you werent taught how to tackle a huge amount o pages in a short time in order to get the info you need in high school this bit can be killer. College is a huge storm of things being thrown at you especially your first year you can do it you just have to figure out what works for you and what your hinderances are. ,college,ddk58ow,2,t5_2qh3z

I had the receipt and everything to prove it too. To top it all off she had a kid in the passanger seat as she was yelling profanities through the window and holding up the long ass line of orders I had to take and when its dealing with shitty customers its dealing with shitty superiors. I had another job at the local library and I enjoyed it for the most part but I had this asian woman who was always on my ass saying you show no enthusiasm for your job or whatever that means even though I did the job fairly well and assisted everyone who came up and asked me a question or whatever else they asked of me.

I dont know you or the conversations youre having but unfortunately a lot of people are turned off by those who dont drink and are vocal about it. The only advice I can give is to not bring it up unless you have to. If they invite you to a party  go to the party etc. You dont need to bring up sobriety until they offer you a drink. Feel free to say you dont do it and opt for a soda or whatever. If theyre jerks about it move on and find better people. gtIve considered rushing  but Ive been told the fact that I dont drink really kills my chances of getting a bidDepends on the school depends on the fraternity.

11200034,0,t3_5znwcp,As someone who studied Anthropology Im looking through Chicos program availability. Anthropology would be a great start but youd have to choose the right classes. Here are the major requirements for an Anthropology degree so when choosing classes Id try to and go for the archaeology and physical anthropology classes. Youll have to take some cultural and theory classes eventually but thats okay. So looking at that link for example youd take those  major core courses. When youre ready for your major courses Id go with Anth first so that when youre done with a couple of those you can take Anth Human Identification the next term. You know plan out your schedule and choose classes that would help you out the most so that when youre job searching you can put BA in Anthropology specialization in forensic and biological anthropology. Anthropology is a broad field so youll have to be specific and tell your hiring managers what exactly you studied and were interested in. The certificate in forensic identification is something that you should definitely utilize. Im not sure how much a minor in Psychology will help you out but looking at the certificate requirements that should already be enough to fill out your schedule. You dont want to overdo it as Anthropology classes tend to have a lot of reading and essays. The certificate itself requires an extra  units at least. Some of those units will carry over from your major requirements but it looks like youll have to take some classes outside of your major for the certificate Biology Chemistry Political Science Sociology etc. and that is already a big undertaking.

Think hard about whether not taking those painful premed classes is worth giving up your dream. I guess with all the experiences Ive had in between coming into college as a premed and ending up as a CS student I know where my strengths are and I know that telling myself I just wasnt cut out for chemistry and physics was also kind of cheating myself out of opportunities.

11564081,0,t3_64w53x,You should find a third alternative.  No time like now to get on the right track but it shouldnt take you a full three years.  You might want to consider a bootcamp for coding  CodeFellows or otherwise.  These arent cheap but they can be the perfect addition to a BA when you want to get on the coding track. And even K for  months is better than K for  years.  Happy to advise further if you think I can be helpful.,college,dg6sl1w,1,t5_2qh3z
11564447,0,t1_dg6pvo9,Chapel Hill offers what they call an executive MHA program that is almost all online with  days of in person training spread out through the  year program. Are you saying the advantages of Chapel Hills MHA over Charlottes are lost when you do the Executive MHA? Moving to Chapel Hill to attend the in person MHA program is not an option for me at this time. Hope that clarifies and I appreciate your insight!,college,dg6u2uk,1,t5_2qh3z

Honestly all I learned in my majors program that really came into play in my job was some jargon and basic building principles definitely not enough to do my job right out of the gate.
