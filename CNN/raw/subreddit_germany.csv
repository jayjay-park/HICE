But what youre seeing is just people not being informed or ignorant.  Due to lobbyism and slow learning people are used to PDFs as a replacement for paper If only.... And thats whats burned into their brains.  Made worse by firms that are Adobe Partners and proud of it for whatever reason.  Almost everything there generates a PDF. Word the screenshot program installed by IT. You cant get an office worker to learn how to printscreen open a new program and... she already lost you there.    Same goes for webspace. Putting info there is nice and dandy but Maria from accounting needs her documents piled up nicely. And if she cant have it as an actual pile of paper she better have those documents on her desktop hiding that background image of her last vacationyoungest kidgrandkidwedding.    What Im trying to say is loving PDF is not a German thing but a thing of people not used to how a PC can work.  And those tablets will not help!

It took me a second or so after a few sentences to then respond...in English...before he switched to English as well.  It was unintentional on my part and a bit embarrassing in hindsight that I couldnt think quickly enough to try.

Simply because of the fact that food service businesses often fail in Germany and the government would be wary of allowing someone to enter knowing the likelihood of failure is historically high? Because the idea of the food trucks havent really taken foot in the German market as they have in the US so it would be a new business concept that they might not know how to process? Or maybe you know that a business model like a food truck simply is not something in which the German government grants the right to establish to foreign individuals?  I understand the concern about food service and failure but that is something that is true no matter where one would try to establish themselves. Starting your own business seems like you really have to go in understanding there is a good chance this idea you have will fail. I am willing to accept that risk. All in all I am not saying I am  gungho for a food truck. I am trying to look at an ideabusiness that has shown itself to be successful in one market and bring it over to another market.

But it differs from programm to programm you might participate eg Erasmus LMUExchange or if you come on your own which isnt a bad idea at all if they offer you germancourses to learn the language and what not.There is a huge community of foreign students in Munich from all over the world and there are lot of oppurtunities to get to know the city and the area.

The first German missionary to go to India was a man by the name of Ziegenbalg around  there are reports of merchants up to  years earlier. He wrote back about his experience and then later brought a young indian man back with him. Seeing that the Taj Mahal was such a huge project requiring building materials from more than two dozen countries one can only assume that Ziegenbalg or his companion wouldve at least heard some tales about it.As for exact references in German documents thats going to be hard to find out. The closest thing I could find was a letter from Christian Friedrich Pressier from  in which he is talking about Agra. He is saying that it is a  month journey away though and that he does not have much information about that region.Maybe someone has asked that question before and the information is out there but a quick search didnt leave me much hope. Youd really have to dig or ask experts in the field.

There are no pipes that can freeze in winter and your home gets warm faster when you return home after work or from a vacation.Downsides are that the air can get really dry opposite of the problem that German homes tend to have to the point that you may have to install a humidifier that it can be noisy that you do have to install air ducts connecting all rooms that it can be drafty can stir up dust and distribute allergens and that forcedair heating systems have a propensity to heat the part of the room near the ceiling and are prone to air leakage. They also obviously wont work for underfloor heating.,germany,cl3w4aw,1,t5_2qi4z

Where I live Leipzig there are a ton of small restaurants including  terrible terrible Mexican restaurants and in some parts of the city the rent can be relatively cheap. Considering many small restaurants are opened by people who obviously dont know what they are doing and which go out of business quickly it cant be THAT impossible to at least open one. You will absolutely have to be fluent in German though and youre not going to get there unless you live here a few years.If this is truly your dream then make plans to move here to learn the language and start with smaller plans. Try to find someone who has done something similar and learn from them. There is a small hot dog shop here in Leipzig that is run by an American expat a redditor even but I cant remember their username. Maybe you should try to contact them to get some real life experience.In any case your dream is certainly possible and I also firmly believe that once more Germans experience real Mexican food they will get addicted too. It will be incredibly hard though and you should definitely seek more expert advice than reddit and not assume you can just buy a one way ticket and start business when you get off the plane. Best of luck and I would absolutely travel across country to eat at your restaurant ,germany,co06hnr,5,t5_2qi4z

Franconians do that far less frequently in my experience.

The work permit for getting freelance work is one of the easier ones to get so this is a good thing. gtis to move Germany teach English as a second language while learning German myselfTeaching English also falls under Freiberuf or freelance work but too many people have cottoned on to this avenue by now. Depending on where you move to there might be far too many native English speakers working as freelance English teachers already. In this case the Auslnderbehrde will not give you a workpermit for freelance work. After all Brits and Irish are native speakers too and as EU citizens they get priority over citizens from other countries.  There is also the stipulation that your stay in Germany has to benefit German society read economy this is usually assumed if you have a STEM degree and got a job offer from a German company lined up already. gtget whatever other job I can I dont really care what it is I can assure you the German government will care. You wont get a work permit for working at McDonalds or cleaning toilets at the train station.gtThat said what the hell are the logistics of moving to Germany?Two ways One sit in the US and apply for jobs in Germany hoping to find a company who will sponser your work permitTwo come over apply for a residency and work permit for freelance work after arrival at the local Auslnderbehrde and pray you find freelance work pretty quickly.

For most of Germans in Hamburg WG  also means something more than just a flat share its to cook together hang out together etc. I was messaging people offering free rooms and only about  of my messages were answered. Demand really exceeds supply here and that also means that the people are really picky when choosing flatmates.For a room in a WG you would normally pay between  could be more or less for extra bigsmall rooms or very goodbad location. For a flat  from  up but most commonly the price you will pay wont include electricity. Flats are often unfurnished.Also get a bike Hamburg is really bike friendly.

It may have spread throughout Germany while it was under Prussian hegemony but to me the Pickelhaube is still a Prussian thing.I think time is also a factor. Grenadier units were first established in the late th century and were later continued as elite units in some countries until today and the bearskin hat was kept as part of the dress uniforms since the beginnings. The Pickelhaube was a general purpose hat that was first developed in the mid th century and phased out early in WW because of how extraordinarily shitty it was. All preWW headgear turned out to be shitty for trench warfare but at least other countries helmets didnt come with a target marker on top.

3198552,0,t3_2wrq3h,Ooh one of my favourite subjects. But one that Germans can sometimes get very defensive about  they start talking about their love of British comedy by which they mean Mr Bean Benny Hill and Little Britain.Okay so first off its important to understand humour as an aspect of culture. German humour is not bad it is German and and as such it is simply different from American or British humour. Asking why German comedy is so bad is like asking why the German language is so bad  it isnt bad but if you dont understand it it wont make any sense to you.The best way to understand where Germans are coming from is to remember that Germans like a sense of order  thats a crass generalization of course but it does underpin a lot of German culture. Things are sorted into categories and given labels so dont for example describe Urban Priol as a Komiker  he is a Kabarettist and what he does is Kabarett not Komdie and never the twain shall meet. You wont see many Germanmade TV comedy dramas. Monty Python is known in Germany mainly because Alfred Biolek  a producer as well as a TV cook  was surprised an impressed to witness a comedy troupe who were also accomplished actors.There is a time and a place for everything and that includes humour. Although on an individual level many Germans are not above a certain amount of wit and banter in their everyday lives on a more general institutional level life is divided in lighthearted and serious. I would quite like to take a middleaged German to a British funeral just to see their reaction.And that informs comedy. The gimmicks and the ridiculous accents and speech patterns you refer to are essential as signals to indicate that this is the funny bit.And now let us consider the role of the comedy hero. This is all by the way generalization there are always exceptions to the rule sometimes quite a large number. We can compare the American British and German comedy heroes.The American comedy hero is a wisecrack. He demonstrates his intellectual superiority over everyone else with his lightning wit and clever wordplay. His humour is a weapon and so he comes out on top or at least successfully navigates lifes slings and arrows by dint of humour and the audience is encouraged to look up to him as an inspiring example.The British comedy hero is a loser. He is not at all quickwitted or funny in himself but his observations on life are recognisable to us all. He usually recognises his own faults and points out the absurdities of everyday life. He rarely wins out but his dark sense of humour allows him to cope. The audience is encouraged to recognise themselves in him and laugh in the face of lifes essential unfairness. If you doubt this assessment try comparing the original British version of the sitcom Dear John in which John remains forever stuck in his dingy little bedsit and its American remake in which from episode one John is living in a spacious and tastefully furnished apartment.The German comedy hero is a clown. His role essentially is to take the audience out of their humdrum existence and transport them to a place where absurdity rules. From this vantage point he points back to the real world and explains to us why the real world is actually just as dumb and clownish as this fantasy land.This is why Germans do biting political satire which achieves its most sublime heights during the season of Karneval. People take to the stage dressed in the most ridiculous fashion affecting the most ridiculous accents and basically behaving like stupid idiots. They do this as an insult to authority because thats what theyre usually talking about. Even a stupid clownish idiot can see how stupid clownish and idiotic our politicians are.,germany,cotj2pt,198,t5_2qi4z

The german law provides the possibility to make a copy of a medium for private use only e.g. taping a film on VCR back in the day. So you are allowed to stream a movie but not safe it to your hard disk. Some argue that buffering a video is already saving it somewhere but while it is in the temp folder it is not avaivable to the normal user. Besides the costs to bring a person who watched a stream to justiceagain streaming is not illegal and there are judgements to proof it are way higher than the damage done.

That said Middle Eastern Stores will often have fresh Koriander Coriandrum sativum which can be a halfdecent alternative. Many of the common flavour combination in Mexican dishes have their roots in Arabic cuisine so there are some similarities. When the first migrants from Spain ran out of the spices they were used to they sought to replace them with local dishes.

Thats widely believed but I live in a hotspot for engineering and half the people we know who are graduating from one of the most competitive engineering schools in the country are having a hard time finding jobs in their fields and not for lack of good grades. Law school graduates are settling for paralegal jobs  if they can find those  and barely making their loan payments. Believe me before most people here get out of college they think the same thing and its true that some fields are doing better than others but things are tight all around and not just at entry levels either. Things are slowly improving over about the last year but not enough to make nearly everyones ends meet.Ninja edit Youre entirely right though that a lot of people expect any degree at all to land them a living wage for no reason.

4249785,0,t3_39mgau,Ive been teaching German as a foreign language and English as a foreign language for almost  years.  The odds of you learning a language exclusively from a book or app are close to zero.  You need to sign up for a language class especially when youre first starting out.  If you just work on your own you wont get feedback to find out if you are doing things right.  Also a major component of language learning is speaking yep even with dead languages like Latin there has a huge push towards spoken Latin in the past   years.  There is no one to speak with if you learn on your own.  In order to supplement your language class I would recommend checking out   there are lots of rote exercises and most people need them.  Hammers  is also good but Schaums is a lot cheaper and almost as good as Hammers.  You may also want one of these The web site  has a lot of excellent material as well.Elsewhere Bessy mentioned a Langenscheidt dictionary depending on what country youre in this may be sold as Harper Collins or Collins.  Other big names are Pons and Oxford.  Whats the best dictionary?  Well the basic info in all of them is roughly the same.  Go to the book store and try them out to see which one you happen to like the best.  I prefer the Langenscheidt Collins Harper Collins myself but that doesnt mean that its better than Pons or Oxford.In your free time start listening to German music and start watching German movies.  Even if you dont know the words you will pick up the intonation.  As you learn more start writing down vocabulary.  It often helps to have a small notebook where you can write down vocabulary.  That way you can write down and look up stuff you dont know.  If you need vocabulary for the day you can write it in your notebook before you go.  If youre just sitting on the bus or something you can also flip through your vocabulary notebook and study.,germany,cs4nxnv,2,t5_2qi4z

4797258,0,t1_ctxc0er,gt Wars have to end economies have to get stronger.Dont you think it is a bit assumptive of you to say that firstly African countries are going to get better and secondly that improvements in African countries would lead to a decline of emigration? From what we can currently see about the projections in Africa alone we can understand that the situation there will not get much better. Rather even if the economies improve life will remain mediocre. The population alone is enough to warrant this conclusion. By  Africas population will double to .b meaning that their economies will only be under greater strain. Meaning that many Africans those in poverty and middle class will still migrate to Europe for the social spendingeducation health welfare etc.Why a richer Africa means more migrantsYoung Men in Senegal Join Migrant Wave Despite Growing Prosperity at HomeThe Middle East is a different story but even here we can notice some bad trends. For example Egypt whos population over the last  years has doubled from m to m while  of the population lives at around less that  per day. While elSisi is making some great changes to Egypts economy Egypt will not be a stable country for some time and with the current population trend migration will continue happening.Anyway my argument is twofold firstly European countries need to enforce their borders to prevent illegal immigration as it seems illegal immigration will continue to occur for the foreseeable future. And peoples and governments in countries subject to mass emigration need to create policies that will make their countries desirable to live in. We cannot obviously depend on them to do this however but what we can do is give them incentive to do this.Edit missing words,germany,ctz8eq9,2,t5_2qi4z

It is a very good theme park but without the magic of Disney and as such its comparable to Busch Gardens though there are more rides and no animals.There are a good number of big rides and some of the smaller ones are fun too. There are water rides and different rides for all ages. My personal favourite is Blue Fire which has a really fast start and then lots of loops and turns but is nice and smooth.A big factor for your enjoyment is how busy it is. The weather doesnt change how busy it is that much but avoid when any of the nearby German or French states have holidays and its quieter during the week. Ive been several times when you can get off a big ride and run around and go on again. When its busy there can be  minute queues for the bigger rides.They dont I think do a FastPass type system which is a shame because there are lots of smaller rides to do while waiting for bigger ones.There are good food options from fast food to proper restaurants.Have fun!,germany,cuuapd0,2,t5_2qi4z

5057261,0,t3_3k47ed,There is a difference to be made here. Asylum seekers would be those who go back to their countries. They do have the right to be sheltered from political danger in their homeland granted by international law to which germany agreed.Refugees have the right to be sheltered and if the state is throwing them back out again it would be violating international Law.Germany and all the other countries agreed to a law which forces them all to take in political refugees and protect them until the crisis in their home country is over.Migrants are a different story. Countries can choose to not take in migrants. Refugees could choose to want to stay in a new country after their home country is deemed safe enough but at that point theyd be migrants and the country that granted refuge can then choose to throw the freshly baked migrant out.One might think that a migrant might declare himself a refugee to fool a country into granting him the rights which is why we take a rather long time to check up on that costing quite a bit of money.We as in all of the UN need to put together some new international laws about that.As of now many people die on the way to other countries and anyone who has a rusty old boat is making loads of money on the worlds inability to get its Laws sorted out.We are made to slurp a soup of our own making. We ignored the crisis that was going on in syria for years and now half the countrys population is either dead or fleeing. There where  million people in syria now there are ..Most of those are classified as refugees and if your country doesnt take them in it would be violating a law it agreed to follow and enforce.,germany,cuvla58,2,t5_2qi4z

I should hope so! Its still thousands of percentages higher than usual statistics in Germany and any of these are abbhorable. Some nutjobs act like its a dystopian nightmare of rape in the streets but its only that way for the women in the camps only about  are women as if you go to the train stations its just endless floods of men and the occassional hijabwearing female. although I just saw a group of a hundred or so Serbians this week where the few women didnt have hijabs. But the camps are very dangerous for women almost all say they dont feel safe at night.But I just keep hearing excuses and downplaying and trying to discredit as if every single one of the real acts is not something to be outraged over more like oh well yknow cramped area rape happens little riots happen whatcha gonna do.You dont have to think the sky is falling to be pissed off at the behaviour thats being tolerated by people flooding in for handouts after illegal migration across countless safe countries.

We should have a pointbased immigration scheme that considers our interests but we should also take up refugees from war regions.The refugees we took seem to be peaceful overall  like our Muslim population.

Probably good to introduce yourself to a company. However there is a quit good demand of Food Scientists on lots of fields if you dont care the place you live. A lot of my fellow students not all dont really specialize too much at one field because its not really necessary. They get a job anyway. The question is where. You either have to be flexible or you have to be lucky. If you want to live at one specific cityarea it can get a little bit disappointing. For example Berlin you dont have a too big chance getting the job you want. There are to many Students and only a few big Companys which are paying really bad money. There are a lot of Startups in Berlin. Maybe that could something for you?!In other CitiesAreas there is a quit good chance getting a job. Depends on the region. In the South you have a lot of Companies which are processing Milk. They pay pretty good but on the downside you have to life mostly in rural areas.It could be a possibility if you hire at a company in the US and try to go to Germany with there help. There are a lot big US Companies on the German Food Market. With your knowledge of languages you could be some kind of connecting piece. Guess you already thought in that kind of direction .

You can be glad to be a German sure but proud?What did you ever do to be proud of that?The famous philosopher Schopenhauer actually hit it on the head even back in the sgt Die wohlfeilste Art des Stolzes hingegen ist der Nationalstolz. Denn er verrt in dem damit Behafteten den Mangel an individuellen Eigenschaften auf die er stolz sein knnte indem er sonst nicht zu dem greifen wrde was er mit so vielen Millionen teilt. Wer bedeutende persnliche Vorzge besitzt wird vielmehr die Fehler seiner eigenen Nation da er sie bestndig vor Augen hat am deutlichsten erkennen. Aber jeder erbrmliche Tropf der nichts in der Welt hat darauf er stolz sein knnte ergreift das letzte Mittel auf die Nation der er gerade angehrt stolz zu sein.

When I came back from a six month trip through Asia the first thing I did back home was going to a thermal bath. And boy was I insulted by how rude the woman at the counter was. I could not believe it. A few months later I got reaccustomed to it.I also understand the food cravings. I would have killed for my favorite German dishes on my trip through Asia. Luckily I found a German restaurant in a Chinese tourist city that was amazing.And dont get me started about the language thing. When I am with my girlfriends family in Spain they speak Spanish at the table. Suddenly everything that comes out of my mouth feels super basic and silly.

6782799,0,t1_d0kordq,gt i remember a story about a guy called florida rolf He was for real. I was around doing an internship at Sozialamt when things changed and part of my training was to learn the laws. There was a specific passus that allowed German citizens to get Sozialhilfe while being abroad if the circumstances where exceptional. Originally it was meant as a shortterm help something that got a person in a desperate situation a leg up. Say you get robbed or become the victim of theft and all your cash your plastic money your passport and all your tickets got stolen. Now you need money to get to the next German embassy to apply for a new passport as well as get a plane ticket home. In  paper plane tickets and travellers cheques were still a thing! One way to get that money would be to apply for Sozialhilfe in your hometown. The phrase was intentionally kept vague to cover even the most outlandish emergencies. FloridaRolf abused that.  ,germany,d0l46gw,2,t5_2qi4z

Applying for a freelance visa while she works for only one employer  that is illegal. Look up Scheinselbststndigkeit. A few years back a lot of companies pushed their employees into contracts that made them selfemployed saving the companies in question substantial costs in social insurance fees. German government drafted up a law that prohibits exactly that. Anybody who is selfemployed needs to have more than one client their workload cannot come from only one company. That is probably one of the more important reasons why your gf wont get a work permit.   The proper way to handle your gfs situation would be to have your gfs employer establish a branch in Germany with only your gf as employee.

Keep the time and the costs to travel to these intercontinental hubs in mind though. Additionally airline pricing is complicated so sometimes you can get the connecting flight for free or almost free if you are lucky.  It also helps to be aware of codeshares.

7300430,0,t1_d27yz6p,If you look at it from a solely financial perspective sure its a slam dunk. But its a more complicated issue than that and I think your perspective is too limited if money is your only determining factor. Heres a few thoughts. German bureaucracy is a bitch and life in Germany is not easy. If you choose to enroll in a German university as a fulltime student you wont get the benefit of an established exchange program that takes care of a lot of the annoying details for you. Youll be navigating a foreign university system largely on your own as well as the bureaucracy of moving to Germany finding housing getting a visa etc. Absolutely none of that is impossible but it is an inconvenience  sometimes a massive one  that you do not currently have in your life.  German public universities are very very different from U.S. universities. It sounds like you are attending a small private liberal arts college. Chances are you have small class sizes very accessible professors friendly and helpful administrators etc. Do not bank on any of that in a German university. You get what you pay for and compared to the U.S. German universities are more of a fendforyourself environment. You will have to run around to different offices to collect critical paperwork but they are only open  hours a week at irregular times or maybe you have to nag a professor over the course of two months to finally get a paper grade back.Again not insurmountable challenges but presumably something youre not dealing with now and that would prove a shock to you. German degrees are generally not very transferrable to the U.S. market. University name recognition counts for a lot more in the U.S. than it does in Germany. If you abandon your U.S. bachelors for a German one you will save money in the shortterm but could lose it in the longterm if you goals are to return to the U.S. and work there. Everyones experiences will vary and maybe that wont be the case there but I think youd be naive to expect most U.S. employers to consider a random European universitys degree as equivalent to that from a university that they know personally or through friends previous hires etc.  Between B and B is not close to meeting the language requirement to me. I just looked at Uni Freiburg and for their bachelors programs you need C. The gap between B and C is quite big in my opinion and it takes time to bridge that. Your semester abroad will be an excellent opportunity for that however. If youre deadset on this dont argue with us just do it. But I think you are not looking at the whole picture if you are thinking solely from a financial perspective. ,germany,d280cac,1,t5_2qi4z

It needs seven members but nobody said they would need to be in Germany one would be enough for that. Im not sure if those seven would need to meet at least once in person anywhere but I dont think so. Most can leave after it was founded but it needs at least three members at any time. Cost should be well below  . A UG haftungsbeschrnkt. Expect to pay at least   even more paperwork and few people knowing how to help with the option.Edit Apparently even a nonregistered Verein can be taxexempt nowadays. That would be an option as it only takes two people. Expect a few road blocks and legal uncertainties for example are the members liable with their own wealth for anything the nonregistered Verein does? Nobody knows for certain.You might also want to look into just operating as the UK charity within Germany. That is possible in principle and you can even get regular German taxexempt status as long as you fulfill some basic criteria in your charter.

Many people who dont have the money to go to university might enlist in the military so they can afford university or to find a career in the military. Its not that they actually want to fight for America but at the same time Im not saying those patriotic MURICA soldiers dont exist either instead in many cases these people want a career that pays relatively well for having only a high school diploma has LOTS of benefits health care travelling the world GI Bill etc and is easy to get in to.

Just had to laugh about this because its well true to some extent at least for us since I actually believe shaving is way overrated and got my girlfriend convinced as well. Shes never been too much into it to begin with so it wasnt hard. I guess the difference here is that many social clues are different and mean different things that shes used to. For example aside from the shaving bit women have a lot more short haircuts here than in the states and it took her a long time to get past the short hair is just for old women thing. Now shes got hers short too and contemplates getting it dyed purple. I guess the thing is that women here get judged less on their looks and are a little more comfortable being how they want to be regardless what others are saying hairy or not.Dont get me wrong theres still enough judgement in germany to go around but its somewhat less in your face than in the US. Like every time we visit the states I get a lot of weird stares but they let me get away with it because Im obviously foreign i.e. I talk and dress funny whereas my partner has a little bit of a harder time people strangers and acquaintances keep judging her for divorcing her husband living in sin all that jazz.

8104895,0,t3_4q7ik2,Okay lets clarify a few things.First even sections of the autobahn that do not have a posted speed limit have an advisory speed limit of  kph about  mph. The law also requires you to drive defensively and to never exceed a safe speed.Because it is advisory you will not be fined for going over it as long as it doesnt constitute reckless driving. However it will be prima facie evidence of partial liability should you get in an accident and you may also risk your insurance coverage as a result.There are reasons for that. Driving too fast is the most common reason for accidents on German motorways driving above  kph for an extended period of time is mentally exhausting saps your concentration and the risk of an accident  especially if you have no experience with the car or driving at such speeds  goes up fast as your speed goes up. Braking distance goes up quadratically with speed and your ability to react in a timely fashion diminishes accordingly should you come up on the tail end of a traffic jam or somebody changes lanes just ahead of you.,germany,d4r29qn,2,t5_2qi4z

Well I hope you are paying taxes also in America cause you are expected to pay taxes in both countries  regardless if you are just in Germany.

8404787,0,t3_4uqq6p,Eh honest answer it depends. Are private insurance as bad as many people say? No they arent. They are the modern horror stories that either happened years ago or always someone they know but never to someone who tells them. About that thing when you said you visited their office did you go to the guys who actually sold you the insurance or just an office which has the sign of your insurer. Because in the huge majority of cases these offices arent from the insurance company themselves but contracted sales people. Because of privacy laws these offices only know what kind of options you have IF you bought from them. Otherwise they have to work it out with the company itself. So it would make sense that they cant give you an answer if you didnt buy directly from them because they cant know how you are insured.

Were not religious and we dont have kids so those social aspects were no big deal for us. Every year I packed a big picnic hamper enough for two wards of nurses both the gyn postop and delivery wards which my wife had to oversee on the night shifts.Vegetable and cheese plates tuna salad chips and dips cheese wurst and my own potato salad and I always made certain there were Halal portions of everything for the Turkish nurses who were also expected to take the Christmas shifts because of course thats not a part of their tradition.That basket came back empty every year. A few weeks before my wife was due to retire the head nurses came to her with a special request a big bowl of that potato salad for each ward. No problem it just meant I had to cook a bit.Among her retirement gifts were gift certificates for new shoes including a pair for me. We dance tango. The lesson is be good to the nurses and theyll be good to you.As for the work that is available so long as you speak German fluently youll be wanted just about everywhere and will receive further training if you have a desire for a particular specialty but its still nursing work.If your German is not fluent youll be invited to studywork programs where a big part of your day will be language classes where youll meet a lot of other international nurses who will at least have your level of qualification.You are more than welcome to message me privately if you have more specific questions. ,germany,d71wgy8,7,t5_2qi4z

That being said I dont think the language thing is total deal breaker since Ive now rented  apartments in Berlin with what can best be described as complete dog shit level German ok maybe not that bad but like a. or something which is miles away from conversational. The bigger deal breaker IMO is often the lack of documents since this will rule you out from the outset. Always have the standard documents ready AT THE VIEWING schufa proof of income freedom from rent arrears passport copy etc.. Never assume these will be asked for later. Ultimately the more money you have available the easier it gets to find an apartment which is just shit for most people since having more money isnt a problem thats easy to solve. Other options including looking in areas that have less demand. e.g. in berlin outside the ring there are far more apartments available with fewer applicants than Kreuzberg for example.

Since this may be an issue for some relatives involved it might be worth including this in your considerations as any funeral home will tell you.Since in case of an unexpected early departure of the deceased there is very little time for research by law the burial or cremation has to take place within days after the event it does make sense to think about special wishes concerning ones own funeral service early and have them put in writing.There are situations where it does make sense to contact a funeral home of your choice beforehand and ask them for further information concerning your ideas for the burial. So that in case of an unexpected early departure you will have the funeral home you trust to handle the necessary steps on shortdial.

She says she never personally renounced her citizenship because her parents got citizenship when she was  or  and she didnt go to any sort of ceremony or in front of a judge or other immigration official at a consulate etc herself. What we dont particularly know is if  my grandparents renounced their citizenship or retained dual citizenship and moreover even if they did does that mean they renounced hers for her if she was a minor if that was even allowed?Otherwise extremely helpful with your whole post. Thanks and have an upvote.EDIT I found this quote which is with regards to US citizenship  and in  rather than German citizenship circa  but its interestingCitizenship is a status that is personal to the U.S. citizen.  Therefore parents may not renounce the citizenship of their minor children.  Similarly parentslegal guardians may not renounce the citizenship of individuals who lack sufficient capacity to do so.  Minors seeking to renounce their U.S. citizenship must demonstrate to a consular officer that they are acting voluntarily without undue influence from parents and that they fully understand the implicationsconsequences attendant to the renunciation of U.S. citizenship.  Children under  are presumed not to have the requisite maturity and knowing intent to relinquish citizenship children under  are provided additional safeguards during the renunciation process and their cases are afforded very careful consideration by post and the Department to assess their voluntariness and informed intent.  Unless there are emergent circumstances minors may wish to wait until age  to renounce citizenship.,germany,d9veuxg,1,t5_2qi4z

9728085,0,t1_dac6owu,I guess it depends on context there were cases of white actresses in Germany blacking up to play black characters suggesting exclusion to black actresses. It was quite a big deal at the time.I guess the major problem is that when white people black up they tend to act and conform to a stereotype of black people that has more in common with white prejudice than it does with actual black culture if we can say that a black culture exists. That would be what makes it racist. There are examples of Germans and Austrian comedians blacking up such as Oliver Pocher and Chris Stephan which exhibit all of the problems I mentioned above.We also have Heilige Drei Knige which often includes a white child in blackface. My wife and I argue over this all the time but I argue that it might not be easy to describe it as racist no negative stereotypes are observable but it normalises the concept of blackface.Speaking to people one point I hear all the time is that it is ok to do it because Germany didnt have colonies which is untrue or that Germany doesnt have many black residents which is rubbish. Ignorance is not an argument. Just because I dont know the confederate flag is a symbol of racism it doesnt suddenly make it ok to wear it on a tshirt.  ,germany,dac76wl,8,t5_2qi4z

9750045,0,t1_daew1uv,cc uberlinpriezIve had a conversation about this before but the TLDR version is that central station is very nearly always a good translation for Hauptbahnhof. In fact in Kassel it would be the only possible translation because the main station is Wilhelmshhe.Stadtmitte is not a train station but a metro station and so would not ever be described as the central station. Its moreorless centrally located but its not a particularly important station.If Berlin were in say the UK the Hauptbahnhof would very likely be called Berlin Central and Stadtmitte might have a name like City or Gendarmes Place. Underground stations in Londons central district have names like Bank Monument and St Pauls.Similarly Amsterdam Centraal station is located very near to Amsterdams central district but not in the middle of it its on an artificial island to the north.

Thats the point where the relationship begins for them.The other kind meet approximately  times for drinks at some bar then one of them invites the other to see their place and if they agree theyre going to have sex. Then they meet some more times all the while having sex to decide whether they actually like each other enough to make a commitment or if that whole thing is just going to be casual. Theyll talk it over and if both agree theyre in a committed relationship. Thats where the relationship begins for these people.What kind of person you are or want to be and more importantly your partner is you need to decide yourself and act accordingly.Edit as for what is expected in an actual relationship I think the basic things are the same everywhere. Dont fuck other people dont kiss other people dont flirt with other people if your partner might get wind of it. Apart from that it really depends on the person and you should talk about it.

10046105,0,t3_5jdq26,Ok I assume you are not trolling and its a genuine question.    The reason why you fail to understand it is because modern German governance and US governance are based on two completely different philosophies. For the American voter it is paramount that their government guarantees and expands their personal freedoms. The conservatives understand this mostly as economic freedoms while the liberals see it as social liberalism.     For the German citizen however it is paramount that their government makes morally sound decisions. Even if this is at the expense of personal freedom and security of the citizens. Thats why the first sentence of article  of our basic law is Human dignity is inviolable. While the second article already addresses human rights.      Of course this is a direct consequence of the lessons learned from Nazi Germany which is the only example of modern history where a society suffered a total collapse of morality.

Stopping random people for no other reason than that they look North African and everyone knows that North Africans are rapists is racial profiling.Its a fine distinction but a crucial one racial profiling is by definition a racist act because you are targeting somebody based on a stereotype about their race as such it is a violation of human rights.Using the analogy of Nazis and Germans That guys speaking German so he must be a Nazi is a stereotype. That guys speaking German has a swastika tattooed on the back of his bald head and is yelling rather aggressively in the general direction of that Rabbi I think we might need to find out who exactly he is is pretty obviously a sane reaction.gt many AFD voters to impress.That shouldnt be the concern of the police but what the AfD voters need to be convinced of is not that the police are great at racial profiling but that we didnt get a repeat of last NYE.,germany,dbx5kia,2,t5_2qi4z

There is just no way you can spontanously hop on a night train to Italy because all hostels in Munich were full or race through Berlin in two days.

10480265,0,t3_5pv2vx,Thanks everyone!So Im waiting for an update but actual heating technicians and plumbers were sent to our building today. They had previously drained the system and let all the air out and it fixed it temporarily but it still constantly fills with air.We sent the photos to the Hausverwaltung  our building is owned by a company but it seems to have worked  once we sent the photos then the technicians have become involved.Would anyone think that we would still have a case for decreasing our rent? Although they have provided us with small electrical fan heaters theyre not safe to leave on all day while we are at work which means when we get home the apartment is  degrees again and then we have to wait while the heaters heat up the place a lot. Theyre also super loud and we cant leave them on overnight because they cause too much noise  this is ok for us sleeping because we prefer it to be colder but then we repeat the whole cycle when we wake up again.And just for good measure every few weeks the buildings hot water breaks and we have to wait for the Hausmeister to come and fix it. It broke on Saturday and because of the length of time the work took and how long it took for the boiler to heat back up we had no hot water for almost  hours. I of course found this out after going for a run and coming home to be informed I could not shower. In an apartment that was already freezing ,germany,dcw1ofb,2,t5_2qi4z

10552445,0,t3_5r3vno,Not sure what Hausverwaltung protocol you are referring to but you should not sublet a place without the landlords permission. The landlord usually has to give that permission if he doesnt have valid reasons against it. And being caught subletting without permission can end in the landlord cancelling your contract which he normally can do under very few circumstances.And absolutely do a written contract. Not doing so is just asking for trouble as soon as you disagree about something. You also need a protocol of the state the place was in. If youre not allowed to sublet doing a verbal contract doesnt make it any less forbidden. The landlord wont see a written contract you make so its not any more risky than a verbal one. However a person living in the place that shouldnt be there will easily get noticed even if you had a verbal contract.,germany,dd48lab,12,t5_2qi4z

It sounds like youre trying to say that only people who had ancestors from Germany or Ireland a very long time ago can only properly be German or Irish. And if theyre from somewhere else than theyre pretenders. Which is ironic as you are a mixedancestry American trying yourself to lay claim to another nationality on the basis of distant parentage. It not only diminishes people who were born and raised in Germany and speak German like a native while being say of Turkish descent it also ignores the complex  history of these countries. Ireland in particular is a good case study on being its own melting pot. You ask in another thread if youre Black Irish and also say that Ireland was AngoCelt with some recent Iberian. Thats actually misinformation. The Black Irish for all we know might have been the indigenous population at the time with the Celt a more recent migration. I know this isnt an Irish thread but this link may prove useful to you  Americans get very confused about Germany in particular. Half the time they think they have an ancestor who is Polish who as actually German and vice versa. The borders have changed on that one so many times. Germany was for so long a collection of independent states and had its own dark outcome from ethnonationalist mythmaking based on its own very shaky understanding of human history at the time.

Freedom of speech isnt even the first thing mentioned in the first amendment.That is true. But labbeduddels point that its not the first thing in many countries constitutions was misunderstood by cultishalibi to mean that he was dismissing the idea of free speech as something only dumb Americans are concerned about. Many Americans though do seem to think the the First literally means that and that free speech always trumps everything else.gt Do you see how abuseable this maxim is?Literally anything can be abused but the idea that you are solely responsible for the consequences of your own actions is surely a nobrainer.And heres the thing while the example of shouting fire in a crowded theatre does indeed no longer strictly apply if I do that and people die as a result and this has literally happened on a couple of occasions not always in a theatre  the Shiloh Baptist Church disaster claimed  lives for example how can it be that I can escape responsibility simply because I have free speech?Its as if Americans  and it does tend to be Americans  are so scared of what they think is going to be government censorship that they will fight tooth and nail against anything that smacks of... well decent and civilized behaviour.

Its not uncommon to get your bachelors degree without the professor ever learning your name and if you wash out  which happens quite often  its understood you just werent good enough and nobody except you loses a nights sleep over it.When I did an academic exchange year in the US I was quite astounded by the degree of handholding guidance and support you get from your universities  but then in the US you are the customer.

11599493,0,t1_dgasxjc,If they want a deterrent against Russia theyd station troops in the baltics or Poland as they recently did. Those states act as nice buffer zone for Germany. The fact that Germany is currently very safe and stable is the reason why they have the logistics and communication centers here. No need to have combat ready troops in Germany other than for training purposes. ,germany,dgat7od,30,t5_2qi4z

11621383,0,t3_65uby4,To add to what the others said the attitude towards the military as whole is very different in Germany when compared to many other countries. The majority of people in Germany see soldiers much like garbage men are regarded elsewhere. If you need to clean up a mess its great to have them and most people recognize that theyre doing a necessary job but if someone actually wants to do that job theyre probably not that bright and bit weird.This lack of veteran culture or military heroism is sometimes a bit sad for the soldiers themselves but as a Bundeswehr reservist myself I like it better than the absurd glorification that seems to be the alternative. ,germany,dgdam97,27,t5_2qi4z

Also gay rights dont matter if they create isolated communities were they can freely discriminate against them lol.Or maybe the ones voting are actually the ones who dont give a shit about Turkey anymore and see themselves as Germans first and only.

11680166,0,t1_dgjxlz3,You do realize that one bombing of Cologne is hardly representative for the whole of the bombings?They did destroy and damage to a greater or lesser degree  buildings of which only  were  industrial or commercial buildings just .They did however destroy completely  hospitals  churches  schools  university buildingsAnd Cologne was neither the city with the most destruction nor the the city with the most victims.ampnbspLets take a look at Pforzheim. The largest attack was flown on February  . Almost at the end of the war.In the center of the city  of the houses were destroyed.  citizens were killed. The town burned for  days. This is a map of the destruction of Pforzheim. Black marked buildings are gone. Red marked buildings survived.In Pforzheim there wasnt any larger industry that was important for the war. But I guess the destroyed administrative buildings really hit them hard...,germany,dgjyp1z,1,t5_2qi4z
11694175,0,t1_dgljrer,gtIn terms of iconic landmarks Berlin wins hands down the TV Tower the Brandenburg Gate the Reichstag and the Victory Column are instantly recognizable. Hamburg has some great sights including some quite bizarre ones such as the road tunnel that has elevators instead of access ramps where youre unsure whether youre supposed to be in awe of the amazing feat of engineering or shaking your head at the sheer stupidity of the idea but nothing I can think of that really says Hamburg in the same way that the Brandenburg Gate says Berlin.What about Speicherstadt and Elbphilharmonie?,germany,dgljx10,2,t5_2qi4z

Got my own garden and I can improvise BBQ with a couple of bricks and a metal grate.I will for the moment go off the recoredI seriously have never said this but even Ludwigshafen has a couple of nice spots. Not so nice you have to travel there but if they are nearby then go for it.I dont know many cities which would favorably compare to the nice spots of Bad Drkheim Heidelberg Neustadt Ladenburgyou missed that one or Speyerwhich also is nearby. Mannheim achieves being interesting. And Ludwigshafen achieved existence.Whats really interesting is how far you can travel by tram. The RNV connects Heidelberg Weinheim Mannheim and Bad Drkheim by tram. You could go from Heidelberg to Bad Drkheim and change trains only once. The whole area has so many interesting cities and natural areas it boggles the mind. Mannheim is in between the Odenwald Palatinate and the Rhine valley to the south. The sheer diversity within a km radius is astounding.I lived there for  years and I liked it a lot.,germany,dgqbzp8,1,t5_2qi4z

11768507,0,t1_dgtzdus,gt So... a few months ago when the BND warned that actual terrorists might come to Germany under false identities posing as refugees it was dismissed as paranoia and depending on the publication xenophobia islamophobia etc.Most of the dismissals and what I personally wrongly believed was because smuggling refugees is pretty risky. Thousands die on the voyage. There are easier routes for a terrorist organization with the kind of resources ISIS had.As for why this obvious fake wasnt discovered He registered in December  when the crisi was at its height. Of course thats not an excuse lots of fuckups had to come together so it has to be systematic.These days there are more checks and less people needing them so Id hope this wouldnt be possible today.,germany,dgtzort,22,t5_2qi4z
