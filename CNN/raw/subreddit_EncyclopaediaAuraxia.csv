To quote a classic song    Hes the one who gives his body    As a weapon of the war    And without him all this killing cant go on.    Hes the Universal Soldier and he really is to blame    His orders come from far away no more    They come from here and there and you and me    And brothers cant you see    This is not the way we put the end to war.Which is to say the end of the war comes when people do the thing that people as a general case have never been able to do  simply stop fighting. ,EncyclopaediaAuraxia,d2urzhm,3,t5_3egwj

9426368,0,t3_59nut6,I doubt PMCs would be doing much standardization theyll probably use whatever the company or the mercs themselves can afford. There will likely be some similarity in smaller groups but overall itll be the best equipment money can buy.I see organization taking up more specialized fields tank crews sniper teams counterspec ops etc while the main grunt work is left for the irregulars.Tactics wise similar to outfits being generally objective focused mercenaries would be hired to complete objectives Taking out sunderers capturing bases blowing up convoys etc. The majority of the NC would be irregulars and would be left to be farmed and to cause a big mess for the enemy.,EncyclopaediaAuraxia,d9auv4k,1,t5_3egwj

9443495,0,t1_d9d0gtf,So the implications are The Commissariat is practically the KGB  a political entity as much as a military entity A Commissar albeit not a senior one is present at the company andor Battalion level with senior Commissars present at regimental and armycorps level. Some Commissars for example Commissar Misha Azanov hold significant sway over even Generals Senators Field Marshalls and perhaps the President of Auraxis. Commissars do not have ranks per se but do have designations according to the size of the unit they are assigned to i.e. Company Commissar Battalion Commissar Regimental Commissar and so on and so forth. Commissars exist in airborne and TRSF forces but do not fight amongst them they do however hold the power to enforce their will via orbital weaponry artillery AA emplacements and bombers.Now we need to determine the following Would there be a Head Commissar for lack of a better term to coordinate the Commissariat? Would a Commissar at a subregimental level be trained as a soldierexecutioner as well as political and strategic officer? If so would an officer be able to be removed from the Republican Army to retrain as a Commissar? Would a Commissar have a staff to aid them i.e. via educating underlings on the reason they fight brainwashing soldiers with propaganda and generally maintaining morale opening letter before handing them to soldiers and so on? If so what would be the status of said staff?Anything Ive missed throw a brick at me. uxSPYXEx uParagonRenegade.,EncyclopaediaAuraxia,d9d13de,2,t5_3egwj
