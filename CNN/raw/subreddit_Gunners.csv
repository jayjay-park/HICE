In the US a lot of fairweather fans of basketball teams that dont perform well stopped supporting their hometown teams to support the Heat because this was a team built specifically to win championships which theyve done  years theyve been together reaching the finals the one year they lost.

The lad hasnt even had a whiff of senior first team football let alone played a single minute yet there are already articles introducing him with labels like superstar. Its a ridiculous label. I wouldnt even call half of our established squad superstars and theyre good enough to walk into any team in the world.It just raises unrealistic expectations from fans amp press and this puts players under pressure needlessly.  Heres a couple of  reasons why thats a problem. Some players arent affected by the pressure attention... But some players are. The assumption that theyve made it has stunted countless budding careers. Developing players are almost always inconsistent thats how development works. Fans amp press are always eager to over analyse bad performances and slate writeoff players they feel are overhyped.  Its literally the most crucial point of a career. You need focus.

You may ask. Were becoming a wealthy club just splash the cash. Well you underlined the problem yourself in the process were becoming a wealthy club. Were by no means in a position yet to abandon the footballing worlds most virtuous economic model. Especially not for a striker whos merely competent. The success of this club is being built upon sound economic principles and itd be ridiculous to consider breaking them now.This team has proven over the past calendar year that its truly good enough to compete with the very best so have faith that it can continue to do so for another  months without the addition of a mediocre striker.Then in the summer we can truly use the transfer window to our benefit.EDIT Im more than okay with being downvoted this is not a problem.

Do you even know what youre saying? Do you? How would he not have added anything to our attack? Hes absolutely a better backup than Bendtner was offered to us for cheap by Fulham AND we couldve taken him on loan.

Overall I think we did actually play pretty well considering the team we put out. Jenkinson was shit and Monreal took a long time to get into stride although when he finally did he did do some important stops. Kosceilny was an absolute god and kept Suarez in his pocket the whole time. Ox was man of the match deservedly with Fabianski trailing very closely. We should play Podolski more often and Ozil gets way too much stick and does quite a lot of important moves that constantly go unnoticed because it isnt a bicycle kick goal from the half way line. If it wasnt for him that ball would have never got to Ox for him to set up the second goal. Sanogo needs to sort out his nerves and he will be class! The way he was controlling the balls that came to him and had the confidence to try finish although he actually missed the ball a few times showed a lot of potential.

The action itself isnt especially cardworthy IMO outside of the last man rule. If it happened elsewhere on the pitch Id be surprised to see a yellow Sz pulled out and tried to avoid him caught him in the slide taking him down. Fair enough prevented goalscoring opportunity give a penalty.But why the need for a red card as well? Im not saying why did the ref give one the refs a dick im a bad loser etc im saying why is that in the rules at all?Im not sure if you understand that thats what ive got a problem with. Not the application of the rule in this game the rule itself.gt If you drive too fast with your car while drunkThis is two offences. A keeper accidentally clipping the striker when going for the ball is one offence that falls foul of two rules the last man rule and the foul in penalty area rule.The Suarez one is similar but a slightly different rulegt denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity by deliberately handling the ball this does not apply to a goalkeeper within his own penalty areagt denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity to an opponent moving towards the players goal by an offence punishable by a free kick or a penalty kickIn the Suarez case its an action eligible for a yellow which happens in the box therefore gives the opposing team a penalty. So why add the rules saying it has to be a red?

455631,0,t3_1zaqvj, A strikerI was more than willing to give Giroud a second season. But im sorry he isnt good enough at this level. I would love to be proven wrong but im done with transition. We need a world class finisher not someone who is inconsistent at best Right Back if Sagna goesJenkinson isnt ready to step up just yet. A defensive midfielderClearly Wilshire doesnt want to play there. Arteta it hurts me to say it is fading and its shown this season. Flamini will always end up getting  reds in a season and isnt exactly going to be around forever. A Center BackRealistically Vermalen is going. Great servant to the club but if Im honest Im a bit relieved. His positioning was terrible. TacticsYes we get it we can pass the ball left and right. But please oh please can we actually have more than one route to goal for once? Yes against a poor side we can get an amazing goal and look good but against anyone that knows how to tactically setup their team we are boring. Look how many times weve been either lucky or completely shut up by the opposition. Its far too easy for a team to do that to us. And we dont have a game changing player Our closest right now is Oxlade Chamberlain. Ozil is a support player which is perfectly fine. But playing our entire midfield and forward as all support is easy to setup against.From now until the end of the season play Podolski up front until the end of the season with Ox and Gnabry on the wings.

Yeah.Oh scoring against lower table sides is useless? How the fuck would be in fourth without those points? Points are points and math is math.

789625,0,t3_236dsx,FabianskiSagnaKoscielnyVermaelenGibbs RamseyFlaminiGnabryzilChamberlainWalcott Hopefully Ive not upset anyone seeing this is just an exchange of opinions. Ive liked the possession based game weve played this season at its best of course and the fluidity of the midfield behind Giroud as the fulcrum epitomized by the Napoli home game. But in my opinion the game is more about speed power and aggression. You see City Chelsea and Liverpool with those qualities in abundance and it is not a surprise that they have scored the most goals    respectively. I said in another thread that I feel that our game against Spurs in the FA cup was the best combination of pace directness and power this season. Walcott player at striker there and although he bungled all of his chances he looked very dangerous when we broke forward. Gnabry providing in the game what weve lacked for most of the season with Ox out pace trickery creativity and aggression from the wide players. zil would make great use of this mobile front line and make more practical use of his talents. Ramsey and flamini in behind to compensate for zils poor work rate similar to what Mourinho did at Madrid. Back line their is probably a question about Verm over Mert. I have no answer it is just a personal preference.

Perhaps he might opt for a different style of player that would compliment him and bring a balance to the midfield. I feel Flamini despite his decent return and great passion is merely a stopgap for what Wenger plans this summer. Ginter sounds like a good signing. Ive not watched him but a young player that could potentially take over from Mertesacker goes down well in my books. I think Pedro is unrealistic given his form and Barcas transfer trouble recently. Benzema would only leave if a big name came in which I think is unlikely given the limited options this window the same inhibiting us.  ,Gunners,ch0yepn,2,t5_2qhqt

The clause itself eliminates a bidding war for the transfer fee and there would already be a bidding war in terms of his wages due to the fact that hes soughtafter talent. It would be purely up to Reus.gtFor noteable chunks of the season he has had a mediocre midfield behind himOur midfield has only truly been mediocre since Jack and Ozil got injured so a little over month. Ill even grant that theyd underperformed for a month and a half prior to those injuries occurring. However until January Giroud had the most clear cut chances of any striker in the league and also the most clear cut chances missed. So are you really saying that even when our midfield was still stacked Giroud was clinical enough?gt adequate rotation a functioning midfield and actual wingers on the teamAgain weve had a functioning midfield for a majority of the season. Yes having legitimate wingers could help him score more. However his finishing even under optimal conditions and lack of pace to get behind defenses shows that its overlyoptimistic to expect him to score  goals in a season. Regarding adequate rotation that would decrease Girouds appearances and most likely decrease his scoring chances even when hes fit given his scoring record.gtShould we ask his compadres to make the chances a bit harder to put perhaps?If our best striker can only semireliably score from tapins then our attack is incredibly limited. It makes it much harder for the players to create chances for him. Youve completely missed the point of that statement.What I regard to be more important for his future at Arsenal is for him to be more clinical against equalbetter opposition or at more meaningful times in a game tied or losing. Youll notice that many of his goals have either come against lesser teams or were already adding on to a lead. Its great that he puts those chances away but he really needs to contribute more in key situations. Even  goals with lets say  them coming against top  clubs in the league would be a good improvement.,Gunners,ch1bfs6,0,t5_2qhqt

875103,0,t3_244wyx,Its an interesting discussion. is the best for us at the moment. We will miss zil in the  formation. We need to get him involved. Ive always dreamt of Walcott on the LW we dont need Reus. He can definately smash it in from that position weve seen it many times. Then we can just go for Ox on the right. Walcotts workrate is a bit better than Podolskis when it comes to backtrack. Same for Ox. With their pace and zils vision and weight in his passes yeah its a wet dream.We miss two kinds of players. First of all a worldclass striker. Giroud isnt a genuine consistent goal scorer hes a good player but not enough to win the league. Hes a great backup enough to win the league in that aspect. I dont think Walcott or Podolski can play alone they have to play together but Id go for PodolskiGiroud instead. Giroud is a great player to use as a wall his strenght length combined with his great flicks is a threat if you have a second striker ready to shoot. A central midfielder who can do great passescrosses win duels in the air control the ball well like Schneiderlin. I really like his playstyle. fits our system well but we just need other charachters.

As Sagna defends less than Aurier and therefore attacks more with our possession sytle wouldnt the larger amount of time Sagna spends attacking thereby presenting him with more opportunities to contribute offensively act to even out the offensive stats in light of Auriers more involved yet less often adventures forward?I hope that makes sense.

Lukaku hasnt been that good either Evertonians have said he is too inconsistent and cant get his marker off and he isnt even first choice for Belgium Benteke is. Chelsea will never collapse because they have too much money a great manager and their players are content to sit on the bench and receive their money enjoying the trophies.

He was tired of being a squad player. With Wenger he saw that opportunity and took it. You dont get to be a professional footballer with his type of reputation by being someone who quits. You said it yourself its been a massive change of scenery for him. I dont think theres many players who have gone from being a squad player in spain to being the centrepiece of a top teams midfield Especially a club like ours which relies on our midfield for goals as well as creation in England in one season seamlessly. That as well is something Ozil did fairly fantastically for a good portion of the season. At the moment Ozil would be suited better at a club like Bayern purely because of the space that midfield has to operate in and the runners that that team has. However Pep relies on his midfield as much as Wenger does something that Ozil would face even if he was at Bayern. If we get a tricky pacy forward in in the summer defenses will think twice before playing a higher line thus giving our midfield maestros a bit more space. Hell be great with more pace and subsequently more space to work in. If theres anyone to get the best out of him its Wenger. ,Gunners,ci9n2mt,6,t5_2qhqt

He was taunted with racists chants since his debut at age  in Serie C  He has had to deal with a lot of racism growing up in Italy. Just as a matter of fact he is a naturalised Italian from Ghana. He does have adoration for his adopted family and he does have many charity projects in Sudan and other places.This is a reliable interview that conveys similar things Although he does not seem to care for his biological parents who gave him up independent of their reasons. ,Gunners,ci9r6bl,2,t5_2qhqt

They have a lot of templates that are tight fit and others that are not. If anything they have more tight kits than usual this year because the new templates theyve used for the world cup and up coming kits it seems have been relatively tight and then you have the African team Puma kits that are just extremely body hugging.I dont think theyll go away therell just be variation.,Gunners,cibobxy,1,t5_2qhqt

He is already very good going forward even though the fact that Toulouse plays with wingbacks allows him to shine more often than a traditional rightback.

He may create many chances in a match but none of them lead to goals he gets stick for it even though he had done his job and someone else had missed the opportunity. He is a very selfless player you rarely see him run past a few players and score. He would pass it around a few times then create a goal for someone else.

1391509,0,t1_ciqodr3,Obertan Diouf and Buttner cost about  million each and Buttner and Obertan were both sold for profits. Diouf was a good enough player just not good enough to play for the best team in england at the time. He scored  in  in Germany so its not like he was shite. Owen was a free transfer and only got paid when he played.Anderson and Nani were both expensive but both wereare clearly talented. Anderson won the golden boy award but just happened to be fat and lazy so could never show his talent.Young and zaha were overpriced but young was bought for his crossing and assists and at the time of the purchase he had one of the best assist records in the league.Pique and pogba are different stories though. Pogba was obviously talented but had a bad attitude and was shit for the reserves but wanted to start for the first team. Pique couldnt get into the team over Rio and Vidic in their primes and asked Fergie to sell him back as a favour. None of them were particularly embarrassing apart from Bebe which was likely to do with Jorge Mendes and De Gea.

What he said was roughly the same thing that the article says that a significant part of zils finesse is his ability to work under the radar and because of this it is easy to underestimate his game. For Germany you and OP seeminngly ignore that his role for the team has changed drastically since the period you are referring to. In  zil was used as a central playmaker and the team was buildt more or less around him and his skills. Later and particularly in this WC he has generally been applied on the flanks as a winger looking to exploitcreate room and stretch opponents. Something he does well. The midfield has instead been buildt around the BM core which is totally understandable. But it puts him less in the centre of the action and secondly Germany has not profited as much as they could on it. Ive lost count of the times where he has found acres of space in this WC only to see his teammates pick another option. It hardly spells the downfall of zil in any way.,Gunners,cisfkar,-4,t5_2qhqt

Liverpool just doesnt have that draw anymore. If you had kept hold of Suarez MAYBE you would be able to attract worldclass players. That being said Its going to be a very tough season. Adding depth is a good way to tackle a congested fixture list and losing your star player.edit Just to add Ive been following Liverpools transfer progress.

1534857,0,t1_cj8mrp2,Ive played football all of my life at decent levels. The truth is the goalkeeper and central defenders have the best view of the pitch looking vertically but have little impact on most situations outside of set pieces in regards to the positioning of outfield players restricting shooting opportunities. Firstly players cant hear them properly. Secondly the one thing most teams train more than anything even ball work is team shape and at the top level are drilled into knowing their positioning on every part of the pitch in relation to the ball. Edit It is absolutely ridiculous to think that a goalkeeper could effectively stop shots happening against him by commanding players. The impact goalkeepers have on team shape in the defensive structure is minimal. ,Gunners,cj8o51v,0,t5_2qhqt

1553772,0,t1_cjaxdqr,This is a great monologue and all but its disingenious to act as if Wenger definitely rates Jenko. YOU rate Jenko and youve spinning Arsenes moves as being proof that Arsene believes in Jenko when its just as possible that hes sending Jenko on loan in order to generate enough value for him for a midtable side to buy him next summer. IIRC you were spouting off last week about how sure you were that Jenko wasnt going anywhere now a loan makes perfect sense? This is not about what Arsene believes this is what you believe. And the idea that saying a player isnt Arsenal quality means that hes the next Gibbs or Ramsey is utter nonsense. People also said that Denilson Santos Bendtner and Squillaci werent Arsenal quality did that mean that they all of a sudden became better players? If I say that Benik Afobe isnt Arsenal quality does that mean hes the next Henry? Of course not. Just because some players break through it doesnt mean all of them do. Comparing Jenko to Ramsey or Gibbs is completely useless and it distracts from an actual evaluation of Jenko as a player hes become this mascot at this point that most fans cant talk objectively about. ,Gunners,cjb1ep1,2,t5_2qhqt

ENG wins. v   With surprise addition of Flamini for RoE they surprise the French with offensive and defensive balance. Szcz keeps a clean sheet in a  victory for the RoE. However Flamini picks up a late red card and is suspended for the next match. RoE wins. v   Well matched against each other the game proceeds to penalty kicks. Ozil knocks the winner past Arteta after BFG uses his head to block Bellerins pen. GER wins.Round   ENG RoE and GER with  win. AME FRA SPA with one loss.Round  v   English pace matched against Spanish flair. Despite Cazorlas efforts the Spanish team lacked the offensive drive and technique to push the English defensively. Bellerin sends a beauty of a cross in in the final minute but Chamberlain knocks it away...or was it Gibbs? Well never know. England wins and the Spanish are the first to fall in double elimination. v   The French pick up a win here quite easily with the depleted RoE squad handing them their first loss of the tournament.   v   A severe lack in communication abilities leaves Zelalem feeling alienated. The Germans fix the match by offering the young possible Germany national a spot in the next WC is he throws the match.  own goals by Zelalem in the first  minutes ended the game and the tournament early for the Americas.Moving On  ENG GER  losses RoE FRA  lossRound  ENG v RoE  FlimFlam returns from suspension and Szcz performs valiantly in goal but the RoE squad is unable to handle the pace of Ox and Theo. Ramsey and Wilshere exchange kits prompting a storm of WILSHERERAMSEY PIVOT?! across rgunners.

The French begin well but the game is called after Podolski blasts a goal home through Yaya Sanogo. Through him. France eliminated.FINAL ROUND seed vs  seed England v Germany. As expected Wilshere takes a knock going into a tackle he shouldnt.  Ozil seems clairvoyant on the pitch and Poldi hungrily smashes home two early goals.

We won a match against United in  when we were out of the title race but United werent so no pressure and in the absence of Fabregas a midfield of Wilshere Ramsey and Song completely dominated Uniteds midfield. We can recreate that with Arteta and it would be a system Wilshere would thrive in but that would come at the cost of giving Ozil less freedom. ,Gunners,cjq9qfn,7,t5_2qhqt

1684947,0,t1_cjrjg6x,For the sake of playing devils advocate Im going to use Podolski as an example with this.  Podolski is a seasoned player in both club and national levels while he was a particular playstyle as with any player if a coach tells you when you go on the field I want you to do this the player does it especially if Wenger is the one telling him to.  Podolski is a superior player to Nacho in every aspect of the attacking game and easily can provide crosses equal to or better than those from Nacho if that was his instruction.  It is very likely that Wenger does not ask his players to run down the sideline and whip crosses into Giroud that hasnt been a mainstay of Arsenals playstyle since Wenger took over we have played an expansive passing game and use crosses as another option rather than the go to move.  This is why I feel like its a bit outlandish to say Nacho would be preferred to Podolski.  If we wanted crosses we would have crosses from Poldi hes a smart and talented player if he was explicitly told to cross every time he would.  By doing this we would also still be one dimensional as you suggest just in a different way resorting to constant crosses as opposed to passing.Giroud is also far better with his feet than people give him credit for and Arsenal have yet to see the best of him see his Montpellier playing days as reference to this.  While he is great with his head it is by no means all he is good for and I feel as though saying that he is best used to connect solely with crosses is just as much of a demotion as you say it is for him to be used in his current role.  In fact I believe he is far superior as a hold up player for Arsenal because it allows him to make late runs into the box and connect with some crosses put hard and fast across on the ground the  yard box which he has an impeccable knack for scoring from as well as still make late runs to connect with crosses in the air.  His hold up play also allows space for Walcott to run in behind him meaning that he doesnt have to beat  players as you suggest.  I also have issues with playing Theo as a striker I dont think he has the physicality for it yet though hes getting there.  Im much more in favor of having someone such as Sanchez in that position as he has the pace physicality vision and touch to become a player in a very similar mould as Suarez minus the being a cunt part.Again I dont want to attack you personally but I feel as though the tactics you have in mind are very inflexible rudimentary and very much not not how Arsenal has played or should play. ,Gunners,cjrjut2,1,t5_2qhqt

1716612,0,t3_2e2n4f,I have lots of these! At least judging fro the discussions with their guys who sit near me. Also... some people dont seem to get what an unpopular opinion is. I might sound pissed off in the following tirade but Im really not... this is the unpopular opinions thread after all.. I like Giroud I think hes been one of the teams best players over the past  months.This is a perpetual debate with Arsenal fans who spend all their time looking at his goal statistics. Yet even those are not that bad. The guy scored  goals in his second season with the club in the league. Thats one fewer than Wayne Rooney and one more than Lukaku who everyone collectively jacks off to all the time. Granted hes not at Rooneys level but thats not the point. We were not five goals away from being title challengers. Nor are we this year. The fact is that we do not score enough goals collectively. Wenger sees that and has taken steps to address it by buying Sanchez and giving Campbell an opportunity to show what he can do.He also had  assists. That is a good contribution for a striker. Frankly it could have been more. In all the teams Ive seen come to the Emirates Ive not seen many if any strikers who link up the play as well as Giroud. His hold up play is vital to our transitional play and his first time flicks through the defence are outstanding. As an all round footballer he contributes a lot to our team football.Another quality that is surprisingly vital is his ability to defend set plays especially corners. I would say he is the third most important player in that area. An area we have conceded many goals from over the years. At Arsenal that kind of shit matters.The bottom line is that Arsenal need more goals. If we bench Giroud for New striker A we might potentially gain  goals Im sure there are lots of  goal scorers just waiting to be signed  . But we lose his contribution in other aspects of our game. The creation defense holdup play. Wenger did exactly the right thing. He added Sanchez. A player we can use through the middle when we have the right tactical circumstances but who will add not replace to the goals Giroud scored last season.Is Giroud perfect? Of course not. His finishing should be better we all know that. He has moments like last night where he plays into the hands of those who are looking to conform their own ideas. But overall his contribution is better than the majority of the team.Can he be improved upon? Sure. But pretty much everyone can. There are players that need to do more before Giroud comes under scrutiny... and people who need to score more goals. Walcott Cazorla Ozil Wilshere... all need to add more goals. Good teams score goals as a team. Those players need to score more goals. Do we need a striker? Maybe. But as an alternativebackup. Depending on the long term plan with Sanchez. But Giroud is so often the scapegoat for collective failings.. Podolski is not very good.Moreover he never does anything against good opposition and basically scores powerful good to watch goals against bad teams. Hes made a career for Germany doing just that. Hes cumbersome in possession and slows our build up play down too much.Really good for the dressing room though.. We do not need a DMF and Flamini should only be used to close out matches. He does not help the team to the extent many suggest.Arsenal play a double pivot in midfield. Arteta and Ramsey play it very well albeit using different qualities. Ramsey is just epic because he can cover so much ground and is a really really good tackler. Arteta is super smart in terms of identifying the danger. Its just a shame he lacks the physical skills to cover the ground at times.The issue is when either is out. Wilshere looks like hes tired all the time and the play just bypasses him. Flamini wins the ball but his passing and decision making are worse than any of our defenders.I have a few more. regarding Wilshere never being a good player and our warped ideas on what Campbell offers the team... but Ill leave it at that for now Ive rambled on enough.That was cathartic though.EDITMy numbering system went to shit.... why ???

1725965,0,t1_cjwezc4,gtPlease explain exactly why Balotelli is so much better than Giroud. His ability to do it alone. Thats it he can break out with a long shot and is relentless in attack can beat defenders off the dribble wins headers despite being fouled and is calm and collected in front of goal. Giroud bottles easy chances and has shown some of the weakest chances from the top of the box that I have ever seen at this level.Other than that Giroud is actually better IMO the famous hold up play tracking back etc. But in terms of taking a pass and blasting it on frame he might as well be playing badminton for how he compares to Balotelli.That said I dont want Balotelli but that answers your questions.,Gunners,cjwq0sh,3,t5_2qhqt

The majority of us have seen the need and been calling for a new striker for almost  seasons now. With Giroud out for a large chunk of the season on top of that it is crazy to think that PodolskiSanogo can be cover for such a long period! Alexis also needs more time to adjust both to PL and possibly the striker role if thats where Wenger sees him and will only feel the pressure more without a proven target man knocking goals in and relieving that expectation.  Things dont look good being so close to the transfer deadline and Wengers stubbornness never changing.

1812199,0,t1_ck7j5cb,It depends on your point of view on how the players play in the formations rather than the formation strengths I guess. With  we dont have the midfield numbers advantage and naturally less possession which will invite teams forward giving more opportunities for counter attack. This formation will coax defensive teams to attack more. stacks the midfield and we will hold the ball a lot more. Against less technical sides this mean they will fall back to defend a lot more. Against top level sides with better technical players even with  we will likely have less possession and more chances to counter. It really depends on the level of the opposition. Ball possession can also be perceived as a  defensive trait in itself.  If the opposition dont have the ball they cant score!  maximises our ball retention so against less technical sides who cant compete with or challenge our ball possession we are effectively forcing them to play defensively whilst we are playing defensively as well!  If we had absolute top tier finishers like a lewandolski or a van nistelroy who can score with just one opportunity then we can play like this when teams park the bus but we dont. We have good finishers in the squad but not at that level. Our strikers have different strengths we dont have world class poachers.,Gunners,ck7jq0s,3,t5_2qhqt

He is the ultimate glue guy for our midfield. Makes everything flow and creates by far the most scoring opportunities on the team.

1816418,0,t1_ck81ik4,Yeah in general happy with our business during the overall transfer period.. But still think were taking a major and unnecessary gamble without another CB. I think Girouds injury messed up Wengers planning. Instead of focusing primarily on filling a defensive need he had to balance  major needs striker and CB... I think getting a CDM was always a bit of a stretch since I think Wenger really does prefer boxtobox holding types rather than classic defensively minded CDMs... Carvalho was only tempting because he has the rare combination of being a physical DM with the technical passing skills Wenger values... But with this complicated Third Party Ownership scenario and Jorge Mendes as his agent it was always going to be a difficult deal.

Wilshere got wound up and was trying too hard to make things happen credit to Dortmunds midfield for closing down our midfielders so quickly. Far too prone to counter attacks. Arteta cannot be played as a holding mid infront of the defence too slow and no physical presence. Welbeck was left chasing lost causes.

1975666,0,t3_2hbkwi,Well i dont know about others but Dont let Wenger pick his successor. Thats where Man Utd fucked up by letting Sir Alex head hunt Moyes himself. The truth is that Moyes is nothing like Sir Alex and whilst he might have some potential as a manager he isnt suited to a big role like Man Utd. When the time comes Wenger MUST delegate the selection of his successor. Keep the backroom staff relatively intact. Most new managers bring in staff with them but we must insist on keeping our backroom staff together. Neil Banfield and Steve Bould are obvious candidates but i would like to see Boro Primorac aka Wengers best mate stay on too if only to offer insight into the ways of the old boss and how to transition for a new manager. Supporting the new manager financially. Man Utd for me failed with that in Moyes tenure at the club and are only now bothering with LVG. If you want big things to happen you need to accept that a new manager is going to want to bring in new players and ship out old ones. If we brought in a new boss in  i could see a few players heading out the door and new ones coming in. If we dont support the manager and their choices what is the point? Sure the board have had a fruitful financial relationship with Wenger over the years but that cannot last. A new manager will have to be given significant funds to do his job.,Gunners,ckr9n4u,4,t5_2qhqt

2014691,0,t3_2htu7b,Hes made mistakes but I think this criticism goes a bit overboard. Cant expect him to clear out close to half our squad in one summer.HOWEVER theres no excuse for our depth on the backline  despite selling Vermalen and seeing Koscielny develop an Achilles issue with several weeks to go in the transfer window our only centerback cover was a  year old also being counted on to be our cover at right back. Ludicrously poor planning on that front.Its also quite sad to see them elevate Arteta on his last legs to captain rather than bringing in someone who can actually influence and boss the game in the midfield at that holding midfield spot against more than just relegationfodder teams. Arsene just seems to have let sentimentality get in the way at critical junctures  from the insistent reliance on Arteta to refusing to drop one of Wilshere or Ramsey in order to field Ozil in the role that makes this team go. I think whats so frustrating right now is that theres so much to like about the team right now and yet theres mismanagement around the margins that is holding us back. Im not particularly happy with the job Arsene has done so far this season however Im not going to act as if failing to get rid of the likes of Cazorla and even Rosicky however overrated he is by certain fanboys hes still a useful squad player was among his errors. ,Gunners,ckvytm5,3,t5_2qhqt

2060104,0,t3_2idq9k,Thank you for articulating this!I agree with you and felt that our biggest problem was playing with a front three that relied on getting behind the opposition which rarely happens if our opponent is smart enough to sit back and hit us only on the counter. From such a scenario our only real offensive threat would be setpieces which is something else we need work on.Welback is a good front man but only if he is facing a team that plays high and gives him the space to get behind. Against a Chelsea side that is so compact he is taken nearly out of the game as we can see. Giroud on the other hand is nearly the polar opposite that rarely gets behind the defence but fares better in holding up play and winning balls in the box. Yes the ideal number  would be a combination of both of themas we can sickeningly see in Costa but til then we have to make do with playing each of them in the right situations. ,Gunners,cl1on5s,1,t5_2qhqt

2093729,0,t3_2ive1l, Its not RB. A lot of you guys say DM but any of us havent really seen him there bit he does seem like he has the attributes. I see him as a CB but I hope hell be able to move between both. Longterm CB though! Yup he dives into tackles and gets booked way too often. Poor decision making both in defense and in possession hes got decent ball control for sure but spreads his passes too much and is a bit naive. I think Hayden is a bit more physical hes stronger and quicker is better in duels I was really impressed with him against Southampton. He might be more of a DM. Id say Chambers is a better marker and better when it comes to defensive positioning. Hayden is stronger and better in ons and duels. Might be wrong havent seen to much but thats my feeling.,Gunners,cl5yjgh,1,t5_2qhqt

2128483,0,t3_2jc00a,First of all no team allows their players to get bullied or kicked around like Arsenal does. Barcelona for all their great football have players like Busquets and Alves who will exaggerate contact surround and let the referee know and give back as good as they get. If you make it a battle against those guys they are more than capable of fighting back.Our players. on the other hand get kicked far too much and we never manage to get the ref on our side. How many times have we seen one of our players get brutally tackled and the opposition get away with nothing or a yellow card only for one of our own to get booked in the next five minutes for something innocuous like a body check. The naivety of our team is staggering.Secondly Wenger is still talking about coincidences. One moment he says a player damaging his ligament making a pass is unbelievable and then he just moves on calling it an accident. It makes no sense. By my reckoning we have had at least  surveys of our medical team over the past few years and there is still not one person who has lost his job in the coaching team. There is zero accountability there.Finally the last bit about how the result was because of small margins. Wenger has failed to beat Mourinho on  separate occasions now. That is a fairly large sample size. If there was nothing between the sides by the law of averages Arsene should have won atleast one.The truth is there is a chasm of difference between how the two sides are setup. One has a gameplan and is ready for battle. The other shows up expecting to improvise their way to victory and gets beat most times. It is fairly obvious now.,Gunners,cladkwj,27,t5_2qhqt

2224316,0,t3_2kktql,Great post mate very thorough. Ive been using PrenierLeaguePass since the start of the season and it truly is wonderful. The ability to stream up to  game simultaneously play on my tablet or phone or smart TV if I had one really makes it worth the money. Tip while signing up use Hola for the sign up process and enter using the Taiwan site and choose the monthly option in case your account gets banned in which case you wont get a refund so sign up to monthly using the Taiwan site you can sign up for  a month. Only you cant use Hola to stream the games on PLP just to sign up. To stream youll need a DNS service. I use Getflix because its the cheapest lol and has servers in Australia. Good luck! Also note that a lot of people have had their accounts cancelled by PLP no one really knows how they know whether its your credit card address or what no one knows. I havent had mine kicked yet. But I recommend only signing up on the monthly to cut your losses in case it does happen to you. Also in the billing address field find a Taiwanese address and phone number and put it if youre signing up from the Taiwan site. You can use your normal credit card I did. ,Gunners,clmkbhz,2,t5_2qhqt

By that I mean generalising a group of fans in a dismissive disdainful manner.  Of course Ive just done the same just one paragraph above ... so be itNothing wrong with that of course weve all got opinions  but one day you might find yourself to be the grumpy disenfranchised one!As for the waiting list  I think what the guy is getting at is precisely what you point out.  To give up your seat means to effectively lose it for perhaps a decade or more.  That puts people in difficult positions and makes people hoard season tickets even if they cant make half the games.Anyway thats a bit of a side issue though.  The idea of entry being free after halftime while it will probably never happen in the topflight again barring some kind of dystopian future or something would actually do wonders for the atmosphere  Ive long thought there should be a standby system to let people in if its obvious some seats despite being sold are going to be empty.,Gunners,clp8stq,3,t5_2qhqt

2312818,0,t1_clxkpkv,I remember five individuals on this sub pointed out that Montero would have a field day on Chambers in the past few days and many called for Monreal to be moved or Bellerin to start at RB and Chambers at CB. Unbelievable that a few blokes on the internet realized a problem before the manager of top club. How come Wilshere did not come on earlier? Why not have Chambers move inside and put another defender on? I am simply baffled by some deicisons we are away to a very inform side. The key difference this year from last year early on was that we could take the lead at  late on and easily hold it. Now we cannot even achieve a similar level of defense. Regardless of missing personal the system should have stayed the same and the players we have are top quality.,Gunners,clxkvlg,63,t5_2qhqt

2315295,0,t1_clxvhm4,True I just wanted to give an example where a team was basically crowned extremely prematurely yet ended us losing. Also it included Arsenal beating out ManU so that was nice.I also believe Wenger could lead us out of this poor form  and bounce back if someone from the board stopped only worrying about getting money and grew a set by telling him to get his shit straight or pack his bags. Also want Bould to be more proactive since it seems Wenger often supersedes him and does not let him delegate tasks during games. I have seen the Chelsea and West Ham assistants be given the license to bark orders to their respective defenses. I think this direct communication allows players to be more organised and leads to better performances especially since Bould has more defensive duties and we often need someone to yell at the team to get back and defend properly.,Gunners,clxvw2h,2,t5_2qhqt
2315345,0,t1_clxpzxe,I dont agree with the whole Wenger out thing. But...gt were four points off CityWere also  points off of the top spot. Southampton is  points ahead of us too. For a team of our calibre we should be comparing ourselves with the best not with whoever is nd or rd best.gt one point higher than United who spent an enormous amount of moneyTheres also  other teams higher than United and us who have spent less than them this past transfer window.gt Im surprised you pick out transfers as Wengers worst area by far when Alexis is arguably the only thing keeping us from joining Liverpool and Spurs. I think hes the best signing in the league and Wenger was more than instrumental in his capture.I agree. Wenger has not done that bad with the players he has bought. Welbeck Alexis and Chambers are all improvements on what we had. The issue is that we still did not fix up our weaknesses at DM and CB.gt Wenger was open in admitting that we were looking for a DM and a CB but who was there available? I cant think of anyone.We have a multimillion dollar scouting network. If we cant find a DM better than Arteta Flamini and a competent CB as a back up were doing something wrong. That being said just for the sake of the argument Christoph Kramer is definitely better than Arteta Flamini and Doria now at Marseille would be a more than competent back up. Both were available  in the previous transfer window for reasonable prices.gt I think its also important to note weve got a lot of the first team out. Debuchy Kos Theo Ozil and Giroud  thats not insignificant.This happens every season. We need to compensate for it if we really want to challenge for the big titles.gt Im so disappointed with Arsenal this season but to change managers eleven games into a season when youre four points off second is unreasonable.Agree.,Gunners,clxw42s,9,t5_2qhqt

Hindsight is  but its hard to believe Wenger didnt already know this.  I will say that prior to last nights match Chambers had been very impressive so far this season for me.  I guess AW had too much belief in Chambers at RB for last nights match?  Also to play devils advocate here  what more would Bellerin offer other than pace?  Perhaps having all subs come on prior to their first goal would have been the best option?  One of which Bellerin for Chambers.

Whether its Flamini or Arteta the deepest player doesnt have much creative freedom or positional freedom.Arsenal doesnt really have players like Milner Downing Henderson Vidal Pogba etc. who cover for the defensive duties of the playmaker.  Maybe Ramsey could do it but its not the way he played last year when he was one of the best players at Arsenal.Also when you play with a deep playmaker and two boxtobox players theres no real spot for a .  Since Ozil is the best player Arsenal has the deep playmaker  isnt a good formation when hes available.With the current personnel it might be interesting to try Alexis Welbeck and Walcott as forwards with Ramsey and Flamini as bodyguards on either side of Wilshere but theyd both have to be defensively sound enough to drop deep if Wilshere gets forward.,Gunners,cm7u6wz,6,t5_2qhqt

2504344,0,t3_2oaglx, gt I am  sure we will bring in a new DM in either January hopefully or the summerWell I think the club and both players were just as confident last summer not to mention the previous one. At this point Ill simply believe it when its finally officialgt could Arsenal be putting themselves at risk by requiring Arteta to stay fit as one of our  DMs?Absolutely. However theres always someone around who could provide shortterm cover whether thats Hayden Chambers Ramsey Rosicky some suggest Wilshere I believe Debuchy was once interested in being a holder...gt Did Arteta officially sign an extension?Yes according to presumably reliable sources although never announced on .com. Its a year extension.gt If you were to pick between Flamini and Arteta to serve as the second choice CM who would you select?Wenger chooses Arteta every time doesnt matter to me much. I would keep both around anyway whether each ends up   or  holder because both bring other things to the squad and can cover other positions too.gt I think its conceivable that we bring back Flamini in addition to Arteta as well as sign a new CM. Do you consider that to be the minimum depth we should carry going forward?Agree very doubtful to sign two at once. As I said I would keep both but it may be worth pointing out that I have doubts about whether either really want to stay. Arteta did sign an extension but hes really looking for a multiyear deal somewhere I thought he might leave last summer amp if Arsenal bought a new starter I could see him taking the opportunity to move on. Hard to say about him he was convinced last summer that he had several years left in him but if this season changes his mind he could revise his future plans which could mean staying at Arsenal in a more background role and maybe getting into coaching. As for Flamini we fans dont actually know if his contract is up this season next or if theres an option. We also dont know if he wants to stay or intends to return to FranceItaly or even just retire. But as with Arteta I believe that if the club needed him for coverage he would be willing to stay another year. So Im certain that one of them will be here next season but assuming a new player is signed wouldnt bet on both.gt Or is a new CM  one of ArtetaFlamini sufficient?Well it is considering all of the other people that can provide additional cover but its very shortterm. For various reasons I assume that the first holder the club would buy would be an experienced starter who would bump the current players. Thats great but given that neither Arteta and Flamini are long for this club whether due to age retirement transfer an apprentice for the position needs to be acquired or designated soon. It sounds like Wenger sees Chambers at CB rather than holding and I get the same impression re Hayden so there really isnt anyone obvious in the squad right now.,Gunners,cmlgfdw,2,t5_2qhqt

2659853,0,t3_2qg42y,lack of set piece training. it was obvious in the skrtel goal.  men in the box. Gibbs left the first post in order to come out halfway to cover Welbceks man. in the end he abandoned the post and didnt cover the man. he literally did nothing and the ball passed where he should have been. next  four defenders crashed into each other and none jumped for the ball. this allowed skrtel to get his head on the ball free of pressure. nobody put their body on him or impeded him in any way. only Chambers jumped but he was jumping from a further back position than him and coming from far away. he was the only one that did not make a mistake but he wasnt close enough or positioned at a point in which he could get his body on the man or get his head to the ball. Mertesacker then moved out of the way which I still dont understand. these are errors that I would get angry about in my sunday league team. especially gibbs. the first thing every defender knows about corners is that if you get assigned a post you dont leave the post for any reason until the ball is cleared or the goalie shouts to leave the box. and no it is not difficult to replicate corners but it requires practice and players. Arsenal players arent the best in the air and it seems like they are not practiced.  Alexis corners are all horrible. they go to the first post and  times there is nobody to flick it on.

In half of the matches in Man Utds amazing run of games their manager was blatantly telling the media that his team was not performing well.  If they can get scrappy points and their win at the Emirates is the very definition of a scrappy win why cant we?Ultimately my point is that believing fourth is the best we can do is seriously overselling every other squad in this league relative to Arsenal.

2710964,0,t3_2r3y7r,Why are we loaning out Podolski? It makes absolutely no sense besides that Podolski is not happy with his game time. If we are also getting Sanogo to go out to a PL team for loan then we have no clear back up strikers.Giroud and Welbeck are the true strikers on our team now since Sanchez is much better operating as attacker on the wing or behind the striker. Also right now Welbeck has injuries and in no way should we assume any of our attackers are going to stay healthy over the course of the rest of the season.Does wenger now randomly decide to give Campbell a go at striker? Is Walcott even ready to play up top yet I mean he barely looked like he knew due to lack of prior game time what he was doing against Southampton when he was subbed on?Maybe Akpom will start making the bench but he will not offer the same qualtiies that at least Sanogo a viable option. At least with Sanogo we could establish possession by having him win long balls and had a decent holdup ability. I am baffled by loaning out Podolski at this moment when we actually need him to start games for us during this stretch of upcoming games. All I can hope is that Walcott gets back into the first XI seamlessly and all our attackers stay healthy which is probably not gonna happen. ,Gunners,cnc84uw,28,t5_2qhqt

2929485,0,t3_2tp6sn,I doubt Wenger hyping him up would make that much of a difference tbh. He always said he would avoid talking about potential targets because he didnt want the player to attract more attention from other clubs. Kind of like the opposite of what some agents do by linking a player to a big club like arsenal the player gains more attentiongtother clubs start looking at himgthis price goes up due to more competition.I think he was just confident the deal would be done so he wasnt as cautious when talking about it in public.Edit Also a club as big as arsenal paying such a high price for Gabriel is probably enough to qualify him as having exceptional talent,Gunners,co13ebq,3,t5_2qhqt

Arteta is a fantastic reader of the game which allows him to get little nicks on the ball and make tackles without throwing himself into challenge constantly turning possession over. Our most troublesome period as a team this season came with Flamini at DM and he was very responsible for that Gary Neville spoke about his struggles and was spot on  minutes in he doesnt do what a defensive midfielder is supposed to do. Id call him maybe a defensive minded box to box player. But relying on him as a sole DM will never work.

His work rate going back is excellent and personally Id stick him in the middle next to Le Coq.  People may disagree but my opinion is hes a better tackler than striker he has amazing pace to be able to keep up with  players has a lot of passion Danny Rose will testify and can win headers with ease at his height.If his first touch was better better decision making and could hit the ball cleanly without falling over Id have him upfront infront of Giroud.  But I feel his best role would to use him in the middle the same way Rooney is used for Utd.  Slightly controversial opinion but with his attacking mind and defensive work rate he could become a club legend as a midfielder.   ,Gunners,cotnkmh,2,t5_2qhqt

3241100,0,t3_2x8707,I dont know if many people here are into soccer analytics but theres a very good writer Michael Caley unfortunately a spurs fan who models expected goals which compiles the shots taken along with weighting the likelihood of those shots becoming goals based on distance out from goal super important and other variables. He puts our expected goals at . to Monacos .. Even though we played like shit Giroud and Welbeck managed to miss a lot of shots from the Danger Zone. Furthermore a lot of days Kondogbias shot doesnt take that particular deflection and its from so far out that the likelihood of it going in isnt very good. Im trying to say that the scoreline is not necessarily reflective of the chances we created and especially the quality of the chances we created giroud was . Now considering the new Premier League deal as more and more money comes in Arsenal is bound to have enough money to buy a world class striker at some point even a world class striker that can facilitate in the same style of Giroud I hope and in that glorious ideal future such chances that the rest of the team creates get put away. Now of course as more money comes into the premier league other PL teams will also have the opportunity to snag those guys but whatever...My analysis is that we have no answer to being pressed high up the pitch even with Cazorla dropping back to try to make the transition. Ozil disappeared in this regard and didnt seem to be doing anything to connect defense and attack. Its this kind of stuff that makes you wish your midfield was taller and capable of winning more headers so that wed have an easier time bypassing the press. It seems like Arsenal always have problems being harassed on the ball especially our backline see Spurs game. In addition we really couldnt do anything in the second half against Monaco parking the bus which ultimately led to the number of counters which I dont need to describe here. A lot of our counters in the first half seemed to break down because our players got too close together and Monaco was playing extremely narrow anyways we played right into their hands. On a different day the scoreline is more even based on the number of chances we did create and our defense doesnt start panicking leading to unnecessary errors but thats not what happened. Better luck next time Gunners. ,Gunners,coxy3xl,2,t5_2qhqt

Identifying common tropes is not some sort of feminist propaganda it is one of the foundational pillars of cultural criticism. Sarkeesian is not saying games are inherently bad or that men are sexist pigs and this common representation of her is the easiest strawman people who oppose her create in their heads to avoid actually addressing the issues she brings up. Im not saying you are required to agree with her but it is important to engage with what SHE is saying about video games not with what other people are saying about her.

Edit The government cracking down on these things was mostly about tweets that do break the law.

My concern about Szczesny is just complacency. I dont think its a matter of getting better or worse  I think the problem is that hes had a consistently high level of talent and varying form.

Its gone beyond opinion its simply fact.edit got to say Im surprised at the reaction to this!

Having said that I wouldnt be unhappy if we got another striker in.I do appreciate you defending me here and on the other posts but its only internet karma at the end of the day. If people downvote me Im not going to lose sleep over it. Ive given my opinion and its obviously a bit controversial! But some of my favourite pub discussions have happened between either me and other gooners or me and spud fans where we debate massively and passionately for hours before coming to the conclusion that we both have fairly valid points and the one thing we can agree on is that everyone fucking hates the chavs.Dont worry about getting PMs over your opinions it does happen especially in a game of football that encourages high emotions. Like I said I disagree with you over Giroud but I do get your stance  I actually would have said the same a year ago but hes done enough to convince me otherwise.The fact is we as fans can do very little to aid our team. Debating opinions and statistics are part of our mantra. Were all going to think were right at the end of the day.

3723751,0,t3_331wl9,Giroud over Welbeck for me all day until our team balance is just perfect enough to fit them both.Theo for Coq was nice and ballsy but Theo didnt utilize his biggest asset until like we saw for the final freekick. Pace to run at defenders Theo of old was so in sync with everyone else he either found them at the last second or slotted it home. That will come back in time. I wanted Ramsey off for Theo but I was not opposed to giving him another chance in ET.Cazorla on the right and Ramsey middle is how it should have been though play to both of their strengths why not??Debuchy and Gibbs are not up to scratch just yet. Szcz deserves to start the final and Im confident in his abilities tbh.News flash although Szcz could have saved the goal similarly to one of the boys could have attemped a bicycle kick from half field the entire backline fell asleep letting a runner that far into the box on his own and classic Gibbs to fall asleep on the back post.

They spend a fuckton of their owners money just to win the league by acting like some kind of underdog League  side.  They have all the tools to play beautiful football but instead they spend a ton of cash to play uglyass football.City I dont mind as much they bought their way to the top kind of like Chelsea but they know this.  If you actually manage to find a City fan they are aware that they bought their way to the top and they try to play some nice football so I dont mind City too much.United I cant say I care too much for.  SAF was clearly great for you lot and you have been big basically forever but Id be lying if I said I particularly cared for United.  They do their thing alright they play pretty decent football but I was happy as hell last season.  A lot of this probably has to do with the United fans I know in real life.Liverpool is a bit of a laugh.  As a club itself theyre fine.  Rodgers has been ... interesting for them theyve done much worse than Arsenal has for quite some time even though they have in fact won the CL before where we havent.  But their fans are grade A fuckos.  First off a lot of them seemed to pop up part way through last season and then with their talk of how they were going to take on the world with Suarez by their side or some shit.

Going by our track record injury crisis is bound to hit them. ATM there is no one good enough to replace Coq.

3847714,0,t3_34i30w,As much as I understand that the going from the FA Cup into the World Cup and quickly back into the league again can be draining. These guys are professional footballers and should be used to it really. Chelsea havent really struggled neither has Man City. Not to take anything away from our boys theyve once again been unlucky with injuries but when you get paid what they do to do a job as a supporter you kind of expect the performance to warrant the wage.And I understand fully that many factors can slow a team down including personal issues and injuries and fatigue but my argument remains that its a job youre paid for.Were all human I know that. I realise that unforeseen instances can happen and Im not disputing that. What I am disputing is that we cant use the world Cup as an excuse when other teams have not been affected. England were out early so that gave us back at least  or  players. France only took Giroud Kos and Sanogo I think you can all feel free to correct me here. Regardless lets not dwell on that were doing fantastically well considering our poor start and we look on point to finish with a guaranteed CL spot and a backtoback FA Cup trophy so we can give ourselves a big pat on the bag in that respect.The team is gelling marvellously now and as long as the form carries over into next season and the right positions are reinforced theres no stopping us.

E.g. personally a quality DM that improves on or give us the flexibility to play alongside Coquelin is many times more important and would be around that m mark.When you dont have Chelseas cheque book then youre going to have to settle at some point so you cant discount people prioritising.

You have people claiming that zil has lived up to the hype that Giroud is word class and that we shouldnt pursue a new first choice midfielder because of Coquelin.

The hostility toward Arsenal supporters on rsoccer is frustrating but when you see the way people here act its not really surprising. ,Gunners,cqy1ni6,-6,t5_2qhqt
3875748,0,t3_34tzri,Itd be the minimum level of acceptability maybe along with a young striker with real world class potential.We absolutely need another DM hopefully better than Coquelin but someone so that if he is injured we arent relying on Arteta whos just not physically there anymore.I dont think we really need another Defender Fullbacks were almost over stocked and CB weve just brought in Gabriel who will compete with Mertesacker to play alongside Kos and weve got Chambers in reserve anymore defenders would be unrealistic. Goalkeeper is a position we should be trying to get people as and when they come available but Im not convinced on breaking the bank given our strength there and in other positions. Ospina has been very solid since hes come in and I think Szczesny has world class potential hopefully hell come back from the summer driven to win his place back. Obviously I wouldnt say no to the likes of Cech or Lloris if the rumours about his release clause were true.I dont think we need another winger the way we play right now doesnt suit them Walcott isnt really playing right now and Welbeck is playing occasionally. Unless someone incredible is available dont see us spending loads of money on someone we then have to shoe horn into the side.I wouldnt say no to another player who can play the Cazorla Wilshere Ramsey role alongside the proper DM. Cazorla is getting older Wilshere has injury issues and Ramsey has good and bad spells. Someone like Schneiderlin would be fantastic here since he could play the DM role or alongside Coquelin. Wed be sacrificing attacking ability a bit but it would kill  birds with  stone and were not in desperate need of a player here.Attacking mid we have zil Cazorla Wilshere Chamberlain who could all play that position were absolutely sorted.Buying a new striker is a tricky one right now. If we want to buy in someone better than what weve already got its going to cost a lot. Someone that can bring everything Giroud can and more will be tough to find. If were going to splash the cash Id wouldnt mind more of a poacher of a striker a plan B when we need goals who can play as a lone striker better than Walcott. Welbeck right now looks good but you worry about how many goals he would bring as a striker if Giroud.,Gunners,cqy2hdk,2,t5_2qhqt

3971320,0,t1_cr8se96,Id say both of our current keepers are better.Theyre both younger and have more experience at the top level. Opsina plays for Colombia and Woij has been at Arsenal for quite a while with more than  games in the PL.Quality wise they might be the same but overall Schmeichel is below what we already have.,Gunners,cr8ypaa,9,t5_2qhqt
3971659,0,t1_cr8t24h,Yeah. Arsenal are buying everyone! If even half the headlines are true. Well end up buying a guy or two that will play serious minutes and we might buy a guy or two that is more of a prospect that could be good some day. ,Gunners,cr903cn,1,t5_2qhqt
3971670,0,t1_cr8rxdk,Only reason I can think of is AW decided he is gonna let Wojciech go and get Schmeichel as no. .

3973435,0,t1_cr96wk0,Also Ill say in terms of realisticish dream signings Id want us to go for one of either Marco Rues or Bale.  A Bale signing sure would piss of the Spuds haha.  Also both of them are tall enough extremely fast and can shoot from close or from range. They both also have the ability to create a goal out of nowhere all by themselves. Bale is definitely big enough.  Marco isnt quite as physically imposing but his technical skill would make up for it in my opinion plus ole Shad could work on that... look how much bigger Walcott and Ozil have gotten during Shads stay.  Given Wengers track record of taking fast tall wide forwards with technical skill Henry and RVP and converting them into World Class Center forwards I see no reason why Rues or Bale wouldnt work as a stand alone center forward.  I think itd be exciting as hell.,Gunners,cr97duo,1,t5_2qhqt

4390356,0,t3_3bajly,Weve been having this discussion a million times. Im gonna throw out my Colombia bias and be objective. Ive been watching OSPINA play for Colombia for  years now almost. He nailed down a spot on a top  team in the world at . His kicking goes past halfway line Ive seen it tons of times. His precision on goal kicks to get it right to giroud at times has been great. Not sure if anyone else has noticed or doesnt care. Of course szczs potential CAN be higher but from the roller coaster hes had with us so far its hard to tell if that potential isnt dropping by every season. OSPINA tries harder in every game because he has to make up for his height. You can see it in his decision making and reactions. At times he can be a bit slow I definitely see that. Maybe if he worked on his physique we could see improvement. When OSPINA comes out of his area he is far more decisive at least on what he wants to do. I.e Everton at home Argentina yesterday Chelsea at home I know he knocked out Oscar but still decisive  hes more intelligent in my opinion. Szcz when he feels like it is an absolute monster in goal. I used to love szc called him top  keepers in the league in . I went back and watched those games the main problem was his consistency some of our games he looked like he wanted to lay on a beach instead of winning us games. Other games he was cech like. These are things that make each of them good. OSPINA intelligence positioning placement reactions maturity consistentSzcz Height Potential reactions passing most of the time winning balls in the airIn my personal opinion we could loan ospina for first team football or scz and see how our season ends with cech and decide then. That makes sense time and I hope people can stop with all this non sense.Edit just saw their stats from this year. Almost the same amount of games and minutes szcz with the worse defense but made far less saves catches and half the saves per goal. Stats are just numbers but it shows the difference between them THIS season. Szcz  was far greater. ,Gunners,cskj265,3,t5_2qhqt

Im excited for both of these guys especially Ox if he can stay healthy and Welbeck is such a likable dude with loads of pace and strength that Im very eager to see him get some game time as well. The amount of options in the team will only help Theo not limit him. He has more competition so he will be pushing himself even harder. And he clearly hasnt lost any paceor much of it based on the tail end of last season. Not to mention he has put on a considerable amount of muscle in his time out. In addition he has so many service options now between Ozil Cazorla Wilshere and Alexis hell even giroud provides alot of assists for those playing off him. The added service plus the attention players like Alexis and Ozil will draw from the opposition will only provide more space for Walcott to do his thing.Oh and hes the kind of guy who could rather casually pick up several hattricks against lesser opposition that make hitting that  mark very feasible.

We play with two midfielders in  Flamini is more defensive and Ramsey supports the two strikers. Chamberlain is practically a winger and Cazorla plays as a playmaker. He shares the left side with Sanchez. When we have the ball Cazorla plays more on the center while Sanchez goes to the left side he can also switch with Wellbeck.

4553974,0,t1_ct4mhjp,gt Im using an S FFS! The lighting was just too dim. gtThey have left. Nothing interesting at all. They talked very very little about transfers at all. They spent the entire  minutes talking about what happened over the past  days and analyzing every players performance in training and also the match. I will try to summarise the important bits or any other that I can remember. It was quite difficult sometimes to understand because they used personal names for the players. gtBould was impressed with Iwobi which Primorac disagreed. Boro thinks Iwobi is not suited to playing on the wings and his one footedness makes him very predictable to defend against. Wenger added that Iwobi is better centrally but can be effective on the wings when you analysed his movement using their data prediction and stats analysis. gtLewin mentioned Wilshere complained about discomfort after the match but on further checks was okaygtLewin said Zelalem is struggling with fitness and cant last a match for  minutes yet. gtBould said Gabriel is ready for the first team and Wenger agreed with that. Very impressive in his anticipation. Primorac added that he clocked good times for the sprint training earlier.gtWenger said Toral and Crowley might need to find a loan deal this summer. Gazidis Yep will do.gtCant remember who said Willock has no future here for now.gtThey talked about Coquelins performance and training progress for a great deal. But basically they agreed he is the first choice for midfield. Found it interesting that Gazidis mentioned I will tell them to hold on for now.gtGiroud fitness not up to standards yet according to data. Primorac advised Wenger to not give him the full match for Saturday.gtWenger asked Gazidis about this guy called Alex. Gazidis said Yep hes still in Berlin. Its will continue. Do we still go on the second one? As long as it has met the requirements we have previously agreed on. They are not easy. We have time.gtBoro said Vic told him the first training kits has been sent back to London first along with the other items that is needed for next weekend.gtGazidis then talked about some marketing and commercial stuffs which is pretty boring.gtWenger then mentioned that some players need more close monitoring and is going out of schedule. Boro replied I will tell Lawrence to settle this. He knows about it already.gtThe rest is all about flight schedule timings itinerary fitness logistics and upcoming programmes which Wenger kept emphasizing to Boro to ask Olivier to inform the players. ,Gunners,ct4neg2,4,t5_2qhqt

The way I see it they have adequate depth at CB and DM and my understanding is the powers that be at Bayern want Pep to play the youth players regularly which shouldnt be an issue with how tight of a grip they have on the league. I doubt it will happen but its a possibility and I hope Wenger is at least giving it a thought Martinez would give us a huge boost in our pursuit of the league. ,Gunners,ct5sa8v,1,t5_2qhqt

4572035,0,t3_3dnou8,First let me say that this is a good problem to have. As far as replacing Santi I think Jack will be a better choice however shit happens. For example last season with Coq coming in to the team and injuries. So overall I just think it is too early to tell what wenger is going to do and whats the best thing for the team.,Gunners,ct6wygx,16,t5_2qhqt
4572348,0,t3_3dnou8,I believe itll be Ramsey. As you said hes more reliable defensively and positionally than Jack is. His approach is a bit different from the other two but hes a good passer who can consistently get the ball between the lines and gradually join the play and that dynamism is important. Jack is the better dribbler and that can be useful too but Id like to see how his decision making progresses with regards to opting to dribble versus passing.Wilsheres the better option wide imo. Wengers mentioned him playing out there again and he did rather well on the right during . He isnt as good as Ramsey at the traits you mentioned but his skillset can be quite useful in that area particularily when hes isolated against fullbacks.

4632003,0,t1_ctef2g3,They both want  apps and  goals this season to cement the national team position. In the fantasy that they he signed you would assume they were expected to forge some kind of strike partnership as you cant have them playing likeforlike replacement of eachother but Giroud is unable to play anywhere but up top moving Benzema into another position wouldnt make sense to buy one of the best strikers in the world and convert him into something else.  Heres my own conspiracy theory  Wenger wont have two players in the team that cant play together in the current formation with the obvious exception of goalkeeper  Besides goalkeepers there are no two senior players in the squad that cant play alongside eachother in our current formation everyone can play at least two positions with the exceptions of Giroud Gibbs and Bellerin.  Gibbs and Bellerins alternate players are Monreal and Debuchy both of which can play CB. GibbsMonrealDebuchyBellerin back  is possible.  The  main CBs can all play CB and partner eachother in any combination  Chambers can play CB and Koscielny is a very rusty LB but he has played there.  KoscielnyGabrielMertChambers back  is possible.  For our base  of midfield any combination of ArtetaFlaminiCoquelinSantiRosickyRamseyWilshereOx is plausible against the right opposition even the unlikely double attacking option of any two of SantiRosickyWilshereRamseyOx can play together with either of them able to fill in on either wing or CAM.  Ozil is the main CAM but he can play on either wing.  WelbeckWalcottSanchez can all play wide or upfront.  There is no possible way for Giroud and Benzema to be on the pitch at the same time unless Benzema is stuck on a wing which would be a huge waste of his ability.  Anyway thats why I think were not actually signing a striker that can only play ST.  What actually makes most sense in my head for squad balance is a player that can play LWRW and ST and is left footed.,Gunners,ctefmcx,2,t5_2qhqt
4632155,0,t3_3efm8d,Bellerin can play left back hes pretty  footed.I dont think Wenger minds playing  strikers at once like he did in the FA cup final with Sanogo and Giroud so he could play Giroud and Benzema at the same time.I think that it is a preference for his players to be able to play multiple positions but I dont think hell pass up on someone world class if they dont have that attribute.

4691055,0,t3_3f6wgi,Im curious how we go in the future.  During the cheap years we were one of the youngest but as we keep buying guys in their mids instead of buying teenagers and expecting them to start right away we keep getting older.  But were also loading up our academy with worldclass talents so guys like Crowley and Jeff.  Is it going to balance out and we average mids as a squad for years to come?

4794228,0,t3_3gjoyn,Thats what Ive been thinking too. Hes been having us play essentially a  in defense Ozil and WalcottGiroud up top closing down which becomes more of an attacking  or  depending on where our attacking midfielder jammed on the wings goes at times against Wolfsburg and Chelsea it looked more like a  when our left midfielder would drop back into central midfield and Ozil would move out wide.This in addition to Wengers comments about expecting  or so goals from Ozil this year lead me towards agreement. Obviously Ozil will never really be a striker like Bergkamp but in terms of offering him the space to run the channels and have free reign over the attacking third it seems an interesting idea. Maybe Walcott or Welbeck I think stats bomb ran an interesting piece that discussed Welbeck in our side would work better with thisstrikers who are a little more mobile than Giroud. ,Gunners,ctyuo2m,1,t5_2qhqt

We need a CF to be able to provide some sense of physicality link play and provide a platform for Ozil and Co. Yes he spurns a lot of chances but without him on the pitch we really struggle to create those. Walcott should only really be an option off the bench whatever position because hes so limited. And Alexis needs to rest unless you want to see him die on the pitch even him coming off the bench seems too early.Point   while I feel were underperforming under Wenger calling him a senile old man is a but harsh considering all hes done. Yes he got it wrong but all managers do at some point. Yes we still dont really know how to chase a game without throwing all caution to the wind and forgoing balance.

4806414,0,t1_cu0dpx3,You need players who can control the match from deep and make the initial pass of the first phase of attacks. At Arsenal Ramsey is the future of CM and he needs a DM with good passing attributes for the best balance at Arsenal. At Arsenal ArtetaRamsey was a better and more successful pivot than any one with Coquelin. Fact. As a pivot they lost one game and that was Bayern H . Arsenal have no fullbacks who can build and Mertesacker is the only centre back who initiates attacks. If a side plays deep and compact and pressesmarks Mertesacker and Cazorla then its easy everyone should see this. Were unable to be effective in the first phase. Its been the reason we have failed recently. Im not saying we need someone who rushes forward ala Alex Song at all. Just because youre a good passer doesnt mean you have poor positioning. Just because youre a good passer doesnt mean you arent a true DM. Were not going to replace any of our fullbacks so it makes sense to buy an upgraded Arteta type defensive midfielder to partner Ramsey. Thats the best balance for Arsenal and would bring us the most success. ,Gunners,cu0dzcm,8,t5_2qhqt

With print media dying publications make their real money by traffic through their websites.As to why American companies dont fabricate stuff first of all I dont really know if thats accurate or not seems like a dubious claim but if I were to guess its probably because football is a much much bigger sport than the ones that Americans are interested in and football in America hasnt really entered the world stage like all the European leagues are on.

4972386,0,t1_cuk57wx,I think both Giroud and Walcott have intelligent movement. The problem in the last few games has been that we have faced very deep defences and there just hasnt been enough space. But weve still created a lot of good chances. These games where the teams sit back deep are always frustrating because it seems like we have all the possession all the time and space in the world yet we arent doing anything with it. But its all about probing and staying patient and eventually you get a good chance or two.For me our problem with our strikers for me is that Walcotts ball control isnt good enough in tight spaces so you can never play the ball to his feet and expect him to hold onto it or lay it off to someone. You either find him in space or with a through ball or ignore him. With Giroud he is always available for that pass to feet and hes very good at laying it off and playing onetwos off our midfielders but he is never one to turn the defender and shoot.,Gunners,culb176,1,t5_2qhqt

It just feels like another year of CL First roundQF and a top  finish. I hate to sound spoilt but we just havent pushed on and I think everyone just gets bored. This was meant to be the year push on as was last year... and we just havent seen it. Its September and I already feel jaded. I get the feeling that the atmosphere in Emirates will be the same when people are sitting on insanely expensive season tickets. Im just deflated and I think thats the main feeling most people have now. Its a shame. Even if we pulled off Zlatan or infact anyone even Icardi or some random Russian lad.

Given that Real is in flux Rafa decided against the deal midway through August  as a result the infamous Benzema tweet. Arsene switched targets to Cavani but given PSGs inability to find a suitable replacement within the tight timeframe and the lack of strikers in the market his price would be heavily inflated  something Arsene wasnt willing to match.

5004053,0,t3_3jh1re,Here. This is a brilliant article. Source Arsenal TruthArsene Wenger loves his job. Even Real Madrid couldnt tempt him apparently. They could offer him the cold hard cash but not an environment where no matter how dismally he performed hed still keep his job. Only one club can promise Wenger that and its been making his bed and plumping up the cushions for over a decade.The transfer deadline has been and gone and Arsenal are the only club in the whole of Europe to not have signed an outfield player despite only being able to field one semiconvincing striker and having a reported m sitting in the bank.Where do you think that spare cash is going folks? Reinvested in the team? Evidently not. Used to lower ticket prices? No chance.After a terrible start to the season where Arsenal have been lucky to earn three points in any of their opening four games all hope of a title challenging has almost certainly dissolved and you can bet that Arsene Wengers appalling record in the Champions League will only end in more tears of frustration  your frustration.Many pundits have cited Wengers refusal to strengthen the squad as bizarre but some have also aimed their target at the Arsenal board for not overruling the manager and ensuring that players were signed above his head irrespective of his complete and under indifference.However one person will be very happy  Stan Kroenke. As Arsenals owner he doesnt give a monkeys about whether the club challenge for trophies. Sure hed prefer it but hes not going to go out of his way to get rid of a manager that earns him the sort of Champions League income that enables him to stuff his pockets with cash for strategic and advisory services  under any other name a dividend.And Arsene Wenger knows that which is why making money  hence protecting himself  will always come above whats best for Arsenal as a footballing institution. After all what has Arsene Wenger to fear? Year after year hes underachieved and whats become of it? Nothing. He gets to keep his job and enjoy the fruits of a lavish wage packet that is almost unrivalled among his managerial peers.Life carries on for Wenger regardless. His dream of creating an uber team of small technically gifted players remains unchecked and untainted no matter how repetitive and obvious the shortcomings.When it goes tits up the fans scream and shout a couple of times a season then get back into bed whenever theres a winning streak. For the most disgruntled of supporters the club has learned its lesson and disabled questions from the floor at AGM and AST meetings protecting the manager from public criticism.The media are afraid to push any Wenger Out agenda too far for fear of getting thrown out of their comfy press conference hot seat. When questions are asked theyre deflected with ease as Wenger resorts to clichs or a sudden inability to master the English language.CEO Ivan Gazidis  employed by Wenger is clueless and spineless  dont expect him to ever change the narrative hes too well paid and knows where his bread is buttered.The big Arsenal websites could feasibly sway opinion by admitting the obvious and sustaining pressure on the manager but prefer not to upset the apple cart  or their Google AdSense income. Only if there was a huge uprising would they jump on the bandwagon.So Wenger is protected from every angle. He can fail as often as he wants to fail and will never be held accountable. A few wins and the fans the only people that can truly make a difference pipe down and suck the Wenger comfort blanket they always return to for fear of admitting their beloved manager has made them look like plonkers.Arsenal is a mirror image of UK inc. A huge moneymaking machine where the political establishment is untouchable and the ruling elite bankers plunder all the wealth and leave everybody else to suffer their tomfoolery.Gazidis Kroenke and Wenger have rigged the game  they all protect each others backs then pay each other off while the Plebeians fight amongst themselves on ArsenalFan TV.Im out of it.

5095622,0,t3_3ksus5,One of the problems with chance conversion as a stat is in a sport where theres no penalty for taking a shot it doesnt actually matter. That is whether you take  shots per match to score  goal or  shots to score  goal the team still gets one goal. The conversion rate only matters if shots were scarce. In other words its only an issue where one players shot prevents anothers. That doesnt often happen. The interesting thing is that virtually all good strikers conversion rates hover around  percent. This is true of almost everyone except Messi who clusters around  percent. If you take for instance Suarez he did improve his conversion rate in his great season of . But the big thing was he took  plus shots. Thus he scored ish goals in the league at a  percent ish rate. In a world where almost all strikers of a certain skill level have the same conversion rate the issue becomes how many shots can the player take. That is essentially the difference between strikers and becomes the most important thing. Thus the difference between a striker who scores at a  percent clip and scores  a season Theo and a striker who scores at a  percent clip and scores  a season Thierryalso a different era BTW is the number of shots taken. The crucial realization is that taking more shots is a skill.  Thus part of Agueros superiority to Theo is that he takes more shots on a yearly basis. Whether that difference is due to fitness or shear shot creating ability is irrelevant. ,Gunners,cv07ol5,55,t5_2qhqt

5167613,0,t3_3lrtc3,I think a lot of our fans need to take a massive step back and accept some realities that have been collectively ignored to feed the rage.Yes the officiating was terrible. Dean and his assistants failed to observe the trouble spots made a series of egregious errors and lost control of the game.Yes Diego Costa and some of his team mates are pricks and Im hoping the FA do the right thing and hand out a punishment.That all being said some of the conventional truths that have emerged out of the aftermath of this game are just false and feed into the sense of injustice that were all clinging to. The first issue is the one where we were somehow bossing the game. Some have come down from that to simply say it was even. The reality is neither us nor Chelsea had created much in terms of chances but at certain points in the first half they were enjoying over  of the possession! If all officiating had been correct Chelsea may have been  up at the break. Gabby fouled in the box. Attackers defenders and former referees alike watching the replay agreed it was a penalty. Theo wasnt called offside erroneously. This is one pushed pretty hard by Arsenalist.com but no matter how narrow the margin he was ahead of the last defender when the ball was played maybe by only an arm but those are the rules. Zouma grabbed Gabriels throat...after Gabriel grabbed his! This one has definitely been lost out there but its true Watch Zoumas face as the commentator says the word possibly and youll see the fingers coming up from Gabbys hand. Ramsey fouled Cesc for the free kick. This one again is being pushed by Arsenalist Ask yourself this as an Arsenal fan whos watched Cesc for years does he usually sky kick at a ball in front of him missing it entirely? Why isnt Ramsey complaining that he didnt touch Cesc? Ive already explained what I see happening in the video on a post where many of the upvoted comments simply claim there was no foul at all. Cescs foot is clipped by Ramsey before he can kick the ball back to his defenders. Its soft but its a foul. Chelsea players were not committing similar fouls to Cazorlas second and getting away with it. The only example of a foul like that where the studs of the players foot made contact with any part of an Arsenal players leg was Oscar on Koscielny and he was rightly booked for it. The notion that there were others is just false. Go watch the game...it didnt happen. The officials didnt see every incident. This is the main and possibly biggest point of contention. People have created this narrative where every slap poke scratch and eye gouge was seen clearly by the officials and ignored. Thats just simply not true. They saw the chest bump the assistant saw the little backwards kick. That was about it. Theres simply no evidence to back up the notion that they witnessed Costa scratching and slapping at Koscielnys face and simply shrugged it off or his subsequent kick at Ox that made even Mourinho pull the plug on him.We have a right to be pissed but lets have some perspective and not let bias take us down illogical roads. We were hard done by but a better showing by our team would have mitigated those situations. By dwelling on these injustices many completely fabricated by our own sense of moral rage were ignoring the shortcomings of this team.,Gunners,cv8vz12,9,t5_2qhqt

5346330,0,t3_3o8w6p,I think some people have the wrong idea of what makes a good captain for Arsenal or any other sports captain for that matter. Technical skills flair or popularity among fans shouldnt be themselves prerequisites for the captaincy.The ability to read the game knowing how and when to adapt to changes on the pitch and strong work ethic should be some things to consider and easily so given theyre more overt qualities that we can easily spot. But leadership involves much more subtle qualities that may not be as easy to identify from only watching games and seeing snippets of whats going on behind the scenes. Things such as emotional maturity influence within the team the ability to motivate others and effective communication are just as important and should be considered as well for the role.  ,Gunners,cvv1y9s,8,t5_2qhqt

5400056,0,t1_cw14ws0,gt  Its not like we had to save up to buy Ozil or Sanchez.But it is.  Our actual transfer funds arent the full total of what we have in the bank.  The vast majority of those funds are set aside as reserves to cover current operating expenses and longterm financial liabilities.  The Swiss Ramble has the best recent coverage of Arsenals financial position and reports that Arsenal claims that of the m in the bank m is unspoken for and otherwise available to fund transfers  Lets conservatively assume it is going to take m to pry top talent away from a seller.  That money is simply not there if we participated in auctions for Kondogbia Falcao Casillas Cabaye Cavani Willian or god forbid a  yearold Zlatan  all players this sub has called for Arsenal to chase over the past couple of years.  And we would be no better off and in fact quite a bit poorer if wed spent that money on Falcao Casillas and Cabaye.Arsenals transfer policy has remained the same  buy young and cheap.  Develop talent internally.  The new funds and reduced financial burden of the Emirates has opened up an opportunity to augment that policy with high value acquisitions but it hasnt changed Wengers policy to never overpay.  Its not nobility  its simply good management of a footballing resource.gt I also refuse to believe that there wasnt a single DM in the entire world that we could purchased at a reasonable price that would be an improvement over arteta or flamini.But Wenger has to have both  quality on the field and reasonable price.  Wenger claimed that it was exceptionally difficult to get the latter.  As soon as an EPL team came knocking the price would go up.But after all this Ive got to admit I agree with you on Kondogbia at least.  Transfer fee aside Schneiderlins wage demands were going to be a problem as it would have skewed Arsenals wage structure How can you pay him that when you only pay me this?!  Repeat that conversation  times across the squad.Kondogbias wages on transfermarkt look affordable.  Hes young.  He would have been a player we could have used to complement Coq.  Overpaying to get him would have been justifiable as an insurance premium to tie off the risk of Coq regressing or getting injured.  But it would have spelled the end of Arteta andor Flamini.  In the end Wenger judged that Arteta and Flamini still have enough to give and Kondogbia and Schneiderlins contributions were sufficiently speculative and expensive to take a pass on the latter pair in favour of the former.I think it will be extremely interesting to see how Wenger approaches the next  or  transfer windows.  Aresenals cash balance is projected to grow to over m in the next couple of years.  That would conservatively make over a quarter of a billion pounds available for player acquisitions.  Unless player value inflation chews that up we should see significant turnover in the squad in that time.,Gunners,cw1x0o9,1,t5_2qhqt
5400252,0,t1_cw1romr,I would say that the Tesla Model S is a fantastic car. The two key features I use to evaluate cars are safety and environmental impact. It has proven in numerous occasions to be a very safe car with no risk of lithium fires. As electric motors are more efficient than their combustion counterparts the impact is reduced as well especially if you charge with solar panels.Some people are also interested in other things and I think the car meets expectations there as well. It has a real kick and can accelerate very quickly. It optimized routes in its navigation system to maximize the distance you can cover. It looks quite sleek and has excellent storage space as both the front and back are usable for storage. The seating is also quite comfortable and suitable for long drives. So yea I think its an awesome car.,Gunners,cw1xx9q,3,t5_2qhqt

Blame it to injuries to attitude to the tooth fairy for all I care but he has been poor. We are talking about  minutes or so of competitive soccer over a  year stretch. . . hes either been injured or in poor form for most of that. He has the talent to be much better and at times hes shown that talent to the world. he was VERY good in  for City But now? Sorry as an Arsenal fan I hope to God they play him over Sterling. If you took his  to present numbers and compared them with Sterlings it would be a damned joke. Sterling the last three years has  goals and  assists in that time frame as an   and  year old Dont go to a thread where people might be underrating Nasri and then underrate Sterling in the process.

It takes a while to get back from such a long absence and as it stands he does not really have many opportunities to improve it either. This was a loss waiting to happen. SW fielding more or less their best XI high on confidence and with everything to win. Arsenal with a team that has no cohesion match fitness or hunger. Many of the youngsters clearly more afraid of messing up than desire to show what theyve got. My biggest worry apart from injuries about these games is not losing them but the mental impact it has on players that might already lack confidence. The youngsters must feel that the st team is further away than ever and maybe even that theyve lost face to the seniors. And for the more experienced players like Debuchy Campbell Gibbs or Chambers whom are already probably struggling mentally it can not exactly be a vitamin injection either.,Gunners,cwf4rwu,34,t5_2qhqt

5589879,1,t1_cwpww9j,It is a well known fact for people who have followed Arsenal for a while that Wenger almost signed Di Maria years ago. TSF says that Wenger said recently as if this was the first time the information has been revealed. In truth it is well known for years. Pretty much seems that this guy is basically writing from general news he reads in the papers and just by generally following the club instead of actual inside info as the moniker TSF would suggest. You can google the names Botelho Di Maria Arsenal and you will see posts and articles going back to  and  regarding this. Certainly not a recent revelation just because TSF may have heard it for the first time recently and decided to put it in his book. In  Arsenal were close to deals to sign youngsters Pedro Botelho and Angel Di Maria from Figueirense and Rosario Central respectively. At the last moment Di Maria decided not to complete the move because Arsenal wanted to send him out on loan elsewhere due to the UK work permit stipulation for non  EU nations. So the move basically fell through. Botelho was signed and never made a single appearance for Arsenal being loaned from club to club until he was sold in . Di Maria ended up joining Benfica a few weeks later in July  and his story since is pretty well known. ,Gunners,cwpz6hb,2,t5_2qhqt

By all means suggest that we should have better backup players than Rosicky Flamini and Arteta but dont say that the reason they should go is that they are injury prone as by that logic Walcott and Ramsey should definitely be forced out of the club. Also why would you want to replace Wilshere with a number ? We already have Ozil Ramsey Cazorla and even Rosicky who are more than capable of filling that position.

5612804,0,t3_3rx0vt,Our academy setup is different to some of the other clubs you mentioned with the exception of Liverpool. Our  year olds train at a different site to the first team Hale End which is in Essex. Once a player is awarded a scholarship they then move up to London Colney which has a dedicated space for the scholars and young professionals e.g. separate changing rooms and classrooms.Most clubs now have consolidated their academy and first team operations onto the same site  Chelsea Manchester City Manchester United and Tottenham. This is the ideal situation as it helps in terms of recruitment and basic logistics. However I dont think its feasible for London Colney to accomodate our trainees as well as our scholars young professionals and first team. Instead the board well Gazidis decided to redevelop Hale End constructing two new stateoftheart facilities buildings and demolishing the old pavillion. This is a process that is still ongoing and will most likely be completed before the start of next season.We used to have the best academy in London but standards slipped and we fell well behind the likes of Chelsea who arguably have the best academy in the country in terms of the talent they have and their infrastructure. At the moment were playing catchup and Jonkers appointment was to oversee an overhaul of our setup particularly at Hale End.Were now investing a lot more money and resources into our academy afters years of running it on a relative shoestring budget.

People are entitled to have different opinions than you without being a fanboy. So no this sub is not dominated by fanboys. And no.   of this sub is not brainwashed zombies who has yet to see the light from your divine insight.I read your five latest comment and this popped up.gt How I am curious where do u get the feeling of Mr. Wenger actually care about winning. Do you have any evidence to back this counterintuitive thought?Its simply amazing what you read from some people on this sub after a bad result. If you want another manager to take over  fine you are entitled to desire David Moyes Owen Coyle or Eva Longoria. People can have different opinions.But sometimes you are just plain out wrong. And suggesting the manager does not care about winning seems more like a case of being clouded by dissatisfaction by anything and everything he does.

People were saying they could get th but its just very hard to keep key players fit and the christmas games are a massive test too. I dont think you can rule them out though if you can beat the weaker teams it doesnt matter as much losing to the big teams. For example we beat Leicester but they beat Norwich away... so it kinda cancels out the game since we didnt beat Norwich. ,Gunners,cxov1oe,5,t5_2qhqt

But yes I think you are correct continuity is very important particularly for the Wengerballstyle of play where we need to move the ball quickly to unlock defences etc and also of course for defensive stability and understanding  something Wenger was perhaps fortunate to have inherited from Grahams team although he was also able to rebuild just as formidable a defence in .Having said that there are many other pieces to the puzzle  keeping a squad small enough to foster these partnerships while maintaining one big enough to handle at least  competitions  Graham basically gave up on the league his last couple seasons we were a cup team back then if were being honest  knowing when to move a player on or when to promote a youngster  knowing when to forge a siege mentality and when to let players relax.Weve had enforced disruption many times player departures injury crises and it has shattered this continuity with predictable effects on our form.  This season we seem to be handling this better but who can say how it will play out  there are lots of other ways we can fail Im most worried now about how the team will deal with being favourites should the press start talking us up.,Gunners,cy8uimj,2,t5_2qhqt

6055928,0,t3_3ygug4,I think its about the type of game we play very technical and inviting a lot more challenges. PL refs dont protect players like in La Liga since some can be bias some doesnt consider certain challenges as bookable offense.That plus PL is yet to have video refs and even so the video refs can have the same thought process as I mentioned above.Also some of our players have certain play style that will make them susceptible to injury. E.g. Wilshere use his ankles a lot to change directions in a quick and sharp manner. Any tackles can make his ankles roll or even broken if malicious. I believe there is a lot more that contribute to a players injury but to change a players style or somehow make refs consider more type of challenges as bookable offense is nearly impossible. Which means they need to consider the one the main ref cant see gt the video ref has to evaluate on the fly nonbiased gt halting the game numerous times can be a hassle and the TV companies wont like it. gt if really enforced the game becomes noncontact and for other fans except us they will oppose etc.If the player changes his style it would mean he would not be able to play to his strength. I havent seen a player that can switch from being very technical to being very physical ingame without losing out to somebody whos wellbuilt to dominate the physical game. E.g back to Wilshere to play his game he has to lower his center of weight and put pressure on his ankles without that he will be easy to be knocked off the ball by bigger players with the smallest of contact. Playing to the physical game means Wilshere will limit his game to distributing the ball or somehow get taller and play like Diaby  who can just use his size and long legs to get past people,Gunners,cydfi0v,0,t5_2qhqt

Incredibly fast  the fastest at the club allegedly  Bellerin has benefitted from the defensive balance in Arsenals midfield all year which allows him to attack down the wings and provide widthampnbsp  Per Mertesacker ArsenalMertesacker was excellent in the second half of  after struggling a bit with postWorld Cup Winners syndrome which as we all know is difficult to deal with. The BFG as he is known to Gunners fans and Roald Dahls lawyers provides the cover to Koscielnys all action defending style and has kept  clean sheets. His job is not to intercept but rather organise and get rid of danger  two things he has done very well all year.ampnbsp  Nacho Monreal ArsenalMonreal has upped his game year on year at Arsenal and is now probably the best left back in the Premier League. Going forwards he is a real threat and contributes to Arsenals attacking play constantly. The balance that Arsene Wenger has brought to his team in  shows with Monreal having kept  clean sheets  joint third highest  despite the time he spends in opposition ampnbsp  Laurent Koscielny ArsenalHas made the most interceptions of any Premier League defender all year and kept  clean sheets as well as winning the third highest number of aerial battles. Quite simply Laurent Koscielny has been immense for Arsenal for some time now and is comfortably the best defender in the league.ampnbsptop . Koscielny. Chris Smalling. Toby Alderweireld. Fonte.

Cazorla is also way more disciplined though to be fair thats something Ramsey can improve on.Also Ramsey is a lot better on the right side than Campbell.

Whilst the games wont have been back to back Im fairly sure I have heard that in times in the past teams played many many times before a winner was finally decided.  If anyone wants to do the research I would much appreciate it.EDIT Did the reseach here  Arsenal played against Liverpool  times in the semifinal before a winner was decided Number  on the list.

6225087,0,t1_cyx5h2l,Cant blame Ox too much though imo. Every time he would get the ball forward nobody would be there with him. Maybe Giroud sometimes Ozil. Because of this multiple defenders would collapse on him and he couldnt pass back because of the number of the red shirts there and he didnt have anywhere to go forward. Tough to ask an offensive minded winger to do anything in a situation like that where we are up  at Anfield with park the bus defending. If theres one thing he should have done better is that he should hold the ball wait until teammates push up so he can pass forward. But I remember one instance where he did that  defenders collapsed on him and by the time Ramsey or Giroud came close to him the ball was taken away. Again hard to ask Ox to do anything well there.But I agree should have brought on Chambers. Ox cant do anything defensively so it was a waste of a substitution.,Gunners,cyx83h5,1,t5_2qhqt

Compare shit like the United fans bringing Mou masks and chants at Old Trafford and maybe youd have a more valid point.Speaking of United they talk so much shit about the manager who helped recover them from the disaster of Moyes.

6310555,0,t1_cz6xczn,Which is not exactly ideal because we dont want to play a . Either it means lose the link between defence and attack if one of the deep midfielders comes forward or we get overrun in the midfield if they both stay behind. Either we revert to a traditional  and our play stagnates and becomes predictable or we morph into a weird  with one wide player and our shape gets wonky and dictates that we can attack only on one side and basically get overrun. There is only room for one striker in the way we play and if we have winger who thinks he is a striker thats not good. Its much more productive and fluid if we actually have proper wingers like Campbell and pick between Giroud and Walcott for the striker position.Edit I think our best combination against teams we know are going to attack will be Walcott as striker and Sanchez and Campbell on wings. We know Sanchez and Campbell can dribble and shoot so if Walcott keeps their defenders terrified of his pace it gives Sanchez and Campbell a lot of space to work with and Ozil can fuck shit up.,Gunners,cz6xu05,2,t5_2qhqt

I agree that Wenger also gives him license to roam though hes also been on the record saying that Ramsey needs to take care of the basics first and work hard for the team and the goals will come. I think the biggest issue over the past month and a half is RamseyFlam combo. Neither is particularly disciplined and they havent quite gelled as a unit.

This is exactly why I would love to have a different striker in the team Giroud is cool and all but he just does not fit us well I feel the team would have much more attacking potential with a different striker.

If we dont win this year then I dont know what defence there is left. With Chelsea Liverpool and United having their worst premiership seasons pretty much ever city massively off form we have no excuse to not win it. The facilitiestalent we have available to us massively outweighs that of Leicester and Spurs probably even City this year. Wenger might be some sort of financial wizard but when it comes to performance in terms of getting results there are plenty better than him. ,Gunners,d03siar,0,t5_2qhqt

6622886,0,t1_d04aqoa,I dont agree with this. You have point in Alexis hurting our possession game but I think the benefit of having another dimension in attack outweighs that. If he finds a little bit of form he will start making a difference. Weve been relying on crosses a lot because we struggle to penetrate the middle without Cazorla completing offensive triangles. Cazorla is also Ozils number one provider and without his help in the middle Ozils been getting dragged towards wider areas to find space. Arguing that Ozil just crosses and our exceptional finishing does the job doesnt make any sense to me. Because we dont have any exceptionally clinical strikers. I remember RvPs finishing made Song look like Xavi but I cant see a similar situation here. I mean look at that ball at Leicester game. It didnt look fortuitous to me at all. ,Gunners,d04d375,3,t5_2qhqt

Also he was out for  months after WC amp  season.If Gabriel doesnt show up in this season I think we need some decent type player for us.

The philosophy he represents seems to be well It would surprise me if the board made a  in terms of philosophy the day he is replaced.gt In essence citys plan is probably more solid than ours as arsenal owners have been very lucky with getting Wenger and keeping himIm not so sure about that. I agree we are vulnerable when it comes to Wenger. But it is probably decremental in the years to come compared to the years that have passed.Theres a lot of whatifs in this equation but City have a long way to go before they can run their current scheme independant of a cash cow. One thing is the dependancy on Mansour. Another is FFP. Even if it probably will be far from faultless it will to some extent hamper the effect of having a sugar daddy. Whenif the day comes that they struggle to punch above their weight in the transfermarket the way they currently can their growth might stagnate very fast.Im not saying youre wrong. Just pointing out that their plan is very much based on the ability to take a ot of risk. Ours not so much. We are currently looking at a situation where City probably will be forced to take less risk while we can afford to take more. It bodes well for our ability to keep up with them.,Gunners,d05qtn8,1,t5_2qhqt

6721440,0,t3_47khk5,I was speaking to my manager about this and saying this shit can be bred of the game and should be. Look at Sanchez for example I bet there were times when he played for Barca when hed cry about getting taken out and do the same. But you see him now often refuses to go down and when he does just shakes his head walks away. Same with Ozil unless youre a proper cunt then hell tell you haha. But my manager thinks thats all a part of European football and England wont catch up until they start playing the same way. Im sorry but football gets enough bad press for people acting like absolute vaginas and this shit would not help.Personally I think there should be a team which review games and incidents of proclaimed diving and play acting and if they are seen to be doing so e.g Alba throwing himself to the floor after the air from Girouds hand brushed his face and he pretended he got shot and they should be given bans accordingly. Thatd soon sort it out. And his goes for our players too I dont wanna ever see any of that shit quite frankly. Ruins the flow of the game and makes you look like a cunt.,Gunners,d0ejzia,1,t5_2qhqt

6745140,0,t1_d0gyaxi,He actually can be effective when dropping down and being a bit more of a playmaker.  He plays that way sometimes with Chile who didnt play with a traditional  while Sampaoli was there.  One of the biggest issues right now is the lack of movement after passes and nobody in the center to receive a pass and distribute. Multiple times today and in other games as well Kos or Gabriel had nobody to pass the ball to centrally.  Ramsey has the instincts to run away instead of coming to get the ball and when he does get it he cant it out of his feet quickly enough.  Having said that Alexis has been shit for a while now and Im not sure what the issues are.  Maybe its fitness or lack of options when he gets the ball but something needs to change with him. ,Gunners,d0h060n,1,t5_2qhqt

We havent seen much of Elneny but by what I have seen so far he does a good job of playing with the DM and having discipline when or when not to push forward. Having Elneny is going to work out much better especially since Ozil and Walcott are the not the best defenders.

If you dont have a good business then you cant really afford to go out and get the best players unless you just want to rely on other sources of income.I was always interested in Moneyball said Kroenke. Billy Beane one of his heroes happened to be our manager at Arsenal Arsene Wenger. Arsene has an undergraduate degree in economics and has always had that analytical thing going on.When we acquired a controlling interest in Arsenal in  after that we started pushing pretty hard because it seemed to me that there were some people who were a bit more advanced in that area and so we were fortunate in that we acquired StatDNA. They gave us a big lift in the soccer business.On what hed learned from the Premier League in particular Kroenke talked about the power of a clubs brand to hold customer loyalty and generate revenue  something which could irk Arsenal fans charged with the most expensive season tickets in Europe.What did I learn specifically from England? You learn very quickly what that brand means said Kroenke.We have a gentleman who comes to Arsenal games he flies his helicopter from South Africa Cape Town to London quite often to watch Arsenal. Its just an example of what a brand can mean and what we can do in sports.Were all working on that and thats the big opportunity. Michael Jordan showed it  you can get paid a whole lot more if you can extend your brand. Manchester United showed it.

Lerner spent a crapload of money when he first got there. Not his fault the money was spent woefully.  million on Darren Bent?

It may not change a lot but I feel like this is the main issue with the club at the moment.I also think a new manager would benefit Wenger. If he signs a new contract for another  years beyond the one left in his current deal and he doesnt win the PL his legacy and reputation will be significantly damaged.

It would be nothing short of a miracle if Arsene buys both a top striker Benzema Higuain Morata Lukaku AND another very good attacking player on top of that.Given the Xhaka rumors and our obvious need for alternatives and I would argue improvements to Coquelin in the middle of the pitch I have a hard time believing that Wenger will splash  million for three  different players striker winger and DM.I really think the best we can hope for is two big signings and then maybe one player to improve the back  that would cost a fair bit less.,Gunners,d1jhe7x,41,t5_2qhqt

7133630,0,t3_4d8rm3,Ramsey is  a starter but the issue is the team make up around him. Coquelin is not the proper partner to him which is why honestly he should be playing on the wing again. When we have Ramsey on the wing we have someone who tucks inside and overloads the midfield. This is why Ramsey Ozil becomes so strong. He moves into spaces hes not supposed to be in which is a nightmare for defenders. What is a full back supposed to do follow him inside? Then you leave space for Bellerin to run into. That is why we were winning back in october because the combination of cazorla ozil ramsey  Coq to sweep up the boy can pick a pass too was too much for defenders to handle.Now Ramsey in the middle has its benefits too just not with our current make up. Ramsey is an outstanding box to box midfielder as well but the problem is ramseys key ability is creating and finding space. So when you have coquelin or flamini who are not as good at picking a pass or moving the ball quickly you basically get a disconnected spine because Ramsey doesnt want to drop as deep and when he does all you have to do is mark ozil and you have effectively shut us down. Put him with Arteta or coz who are more deep lying playmakers and you have the ramsey we saw in . The problem is coq elneny do not maintain possession as well and neither does Ramsey and what I mean by that is they have trouble with picking the pass to connect midfield to final third so you need more short passes in the middle or more passes out on the wing Elneny is fantastic with his interplay on the wing to get the ball in the final third. This is also why coq zorla works out so well because coquelin can sweep up pass it  to coz and he will find someone  making a move lhes like a deeper ozil and then when ozil gets marked Ramsey tucks in to provide another outlet for cazorla and coq to pass to.His main attributes are his touch dribbling and passing range again why hes better at teh muller space invader role vs a true CAM like ozil. His vision is not necessarily insane not bad just not ozil or coz and his defensive positioning can be lacking due to his ability to find spaces makes him in the wrong place to defend. He does have a crazy engine though and is not bad in the tackle. Oh and him and ozil play filthy together its disgusting.,Gunners,d1p0jdr,5,t5_2qhqt

He has had a setback for a month and if I remember correctly Wenger said that Cazorla was usually quick to recover maybe Wenger thinks Cazorla has reached his peak and will only be kept as a squad rotation playerfor the experience or will be offloaded like Arteta Flamini and Rocisky. Although Cazorla is talent he is  years old and the position he plays in now CM is quite physically taxing.

Our defence is not at all welldrilled they are very disorganized and they dont seem too bothered by it. Its like the team thinks its good enough to score enough goals to win any game so they take it easy on defence. We defend much better against a seemingly superior team and there lies the problem.

Add to that the collapse of the traditional top  teams and it becomes even more galling.No its not as drastic a failure as Chelsea who really had no excuses but we cant keep looking outward for reasons to hand wave our failures.This season was on a plate for us and we blew it.

Theyre the biggest club in one of the worlds most famous cities playing the worlds most popular game. The idea that they need to be cautious about spending or not take risks financially is laughable. The club is at zero risk of becoming Aston Villa or QPR or Parma.Its a conscious model they choose to implement in order to maximize profit above everything else. Above history tradition community football and ambition.

You can tell by the way the commentators are speaking and players are reacting there is not much awareness of the seriousness of his injury and that the staff were not really prepared to deal with it. I mean  he literally had to crawl off the pitch by himself  he had a fractured skull! It was after this injury that the PLs medical pitch side standards were reviewed and improved. As a result this improvement in standards probably saved the life of Fabrice Muamba a former PL player who had an on pitch cardiac arrest. Hopefully there will be such an improvement at football grounds around the world following this current tragedy. RIP Patrick Ekeng.,Gunners,d2w6629,21,t5_2qhqt

7761713,0,t3_4lm6ck,An attempt to rationally answer a totally irrational OP. m  addons for Xhaka already a better version of the best we ever saw from Arteta and still only  plus yes captain of a club that made the Champions League is not exorbitant.  If anything in todays absurd market it is a good price.. Not to discount Kroos who is a worldclass player in his own right but he is not a DM.  Bayern tried to make him into one and couldnt do it.  Thus he does not fit what we need as a team.  Hed be an upgrade on other positions sure but doesnt fill a hole the way Xhaka does.. Kroos would cost FAR more than Xhaka and command far higher wages.  Thus given this and the two points above Xhaka made far more sense as a purchase for Arsenal than Kroos.  Again Id still take Kroos but not if were working with a limited budget which we are.. Blind may be an underrated player but Ricardo Rodriguez is a worldclass player.  If the transfer fees are reasonably close as I expect they would be given Blind would be coming in from a rival club Ill take worldclass every time.. Monreal is a bit of an exception to the rule at Arsenal where our fullbacks are generally asked to participate in the attack just as much as they are asked to defend.  Bellerin is an excellent example of this.  Rodriguez is young and yes his defending can improve but that sort of weakness can be hidden on a side like Arsenal more than it could on say a Mourinho side that defends first and foremost in order to counterattack.For all of the above reasons I think you should change your view.,Gunners,d3og2v7,2,t5_2qhqt

Unlike the match thread which is bombarded with constant comments the megathread gives the opportunity for people to discuss  if they want to.Whilst catering for those who want to discuss it also allows people to quickly see what rumours are currently in motion and allows people to see what people think of such rumours.The fact is that transfer rumours and discussions outside of the megathread are allowed. However some articles and discussions which have either little to no focus on Arsenal little to no substance andor effort or are simply reposted many times have no need to be made. In many ways this is just an assertion of an old rule.If you see an article regarding an advancement in a rumour or a substantiated comment that a player has made of course that can be given its new thread. If you have a discussion point which has been neglected before of course a thread can be posted. Its important to note that were not suppressing discussion here which some are quick to point to nor is the megathread dead. Usually those who make such claims give little attention to discussion in the first place. ,Gunners,d3po1rh,-23,t5_2qhqt

Vardy and Leicester were very reliant on long balls over the top and unless were completely changing how we play and somehow get teams to defend against us differently this is a bad signing. We need some clinical finishers in our squad weve got speed and Xhaka adds some much needed mean streak. Im starting to get more concerned with who we are keeping rather than whos coming in Walcott Giroud and Ramsey should move on already. In the case of Giroud I just feel that he scores when you dont need to and disappears when you you need him. As far as Walcott and Ramsey go if they havent nailed down the starters jobs by now they never will and shuffling them around the pitch isnt helping the squad. All Wenger is doing with those  is trying to prove he was right. Xhaka was a great start but this would be a bad move on all fronts. ,Gunners,d42if3f,-9,t5_2qhqt

8030344,0,t3_4p7hta,I dont think people hate on him per se though judging by some of the other comments on here maybe Im wrong....  I think the main issue is that people see a young player with incredible talent who cant seem to marshal it in a manner that allows him to operate at his best within a team structure.Ramsey is at his best when he is given the most freedom.  Thats well and good but our tactics dont always allow him that freedom often for good reasons and he frequently fails to cope with those limitations leading to lapses in judgment and defensive responsibility.  If all he had to do was bomb up the field and into the opponents box hed be one of the best attacking midfielders in the world.  But this is a team game and he sometimes struggles with the requirements that naturally imposes on him.I like Ramsey.  I think if he can learn to adapt his game to those around him rather than trying to force them to adapt to him he can be truly special.  The only impediment in his way is himself.,Gunners,d4ioplw,29,t5_2qhqt

Hes outperforming the best players in the world in goal ratio. And its not like he just poaches for goals some of his goals have been increadible. Club side is another thing though obviously.La Roja have experimented with Sanchez as a striker but have always abandoned the exercise swiftly.No. Thats wrong. We played like this during the entirety of last years Copa in a  variant. Only reason its not used is because Pizzi deploys a  formation. Sampaoli was all over this though and it worked pretty good too. That said Chile do not exactly possess a Mesut zil or even a Santi Cazorla to provide the bullets.Well Valdivia and Matias Fernandez are there. Their roles are very similar and they have more than enough quality if thats what youre after.Arturo Vidal often carries the greatest goal threat in the Chile side.Not really true either.

You have to remember that Henry and RVP who are the major examples that always get brought up actually played striker as a young player  you can see in this article announcing his signing that BBC and Wenger introduce him as a striker from the start. Same story with RVP. But Draxler to my knowledge has never played a first team game as a striker  you can see here that hes played on both wings and as a  but never as a striker. For Germany pretty much everyone is preferred to him up front  Ive seen Muller Ozil Gotze Podolski and even Sane played second striker in a friendly but Ive never seen Draxler play up front in that team.

Its a business that will continue to make money and penny pinch as much as possible before it starts hurting their overall value. So far their value hasnt been hurt much by all our complaining over the last decade. Edit I think youve essentially made my point. If their budget is m as suggested by Swissramble theyve already spent about a third of it on Xhaka. Its very likely Mustafis cost is having an effect on our ability to purchase an expensive striker.

We are asking Arsenal to spend what is needed to reinforce positions in which we are short  striker being the most pressing concern.We know what a Higuain costs we know what a Benteke costs.

But there are problems with the way many here approach it for my view.   When I see videos of chants in the stands for Wegner to resign  Im absolutely embarrassed on behalf of the  fan base.   My main point here is that many seem to see Arsene as some faltering coach way past his time...but from my view  hes been a coach who had kept his class  and produced some of the most beautiful football in the world for going on  years.   Im extremely grateful to have one of the top  mangers of the sport in the world.   And unlike many  I dont see every season as passfail wholly dependent on winning the league.   Invincibles   FA Cups  and entry in to the greatest up tournament every single year is a pretty amazing thing to be able to sit and watch.  Down year?   Could very well be.   But I would never ask him to step down.   I will let him do it the way he thinks is best  because when it comes down to it Im just a guy on the internet.   Want disappointment?  A joke of an organization?  Try being a Washington Redskins fan.   Fuck  we could be Villa fans. I love the passion and love my fellow gooners.   Even if we happen to be snide assholes much of the time. ,Gunners,d6th3ug,1,t5_2qhqt
8704540,0,t3_4z6lss,Theres been a number of problems. Injury rate imo selection bias is part of the problem here but it also goes with the style of football and weather and EPL also to add.. Lack of versatility in winning games is definitely an issue eg some of the cricket score losses.That all said an indepth look at the stats reveals that Arsenal are very EFFICIENT in almost all the measures...... with the EXCEPTION of Conversion Rate and Number of Goals Scored.Even defence is surprisingly a high stat of success.Its goalsstrikerswinger that are the big issue with Arsenal at present.

8708573,0,t3_4z99ea,For sure. The big if is that when a new manager comes in they generally want to bring their own players in. Weve seen lately that the transfer budget barely even covers the needs of an established team. Whats going to happen with a new manager? Are they really going to give him  million to create his squad? Or bust the wage structure? Or even get a manager who is content with the same top  stability? Or are they going to get an unknown rather like they did with Wenger and tell him dont worry about immediate success we need you to build for the long term. Frankly if the board had a successful manager eg Simeone Guardiola etc. and he said I can give you success but I need  million and to clear out your players and an unknown who says I can get you top  without any extra money from you but Ill rebuild the squad gradually over the next few years Im pretty sure theyd pick the latter. ,Gunners,d6u7h56,1,t5_2qhqt

8730984,0,t1_d6wvuh0,To be fair he just started playing striker full time last year. Prior to that he played left wing quite a bit if not full time. Valencias defense was horrible last year. No question. My only pushback to that would be...look at who Mustafi played with. His discipline and sense of positioning would never be rewarded in that defense like it will in ours. Gabriel would fit into that defense for the same reasons he doesnt fit into ours Mustafi didnt fit into that defense for the same reasons he does fit into ours. Xhaka only averages a red card a season. Thats a little high but its bound to happen with such a dominant physical player.

I agree with on the rest to be honest. I think a young wilshere had legit talent to be great but injuries and mismanagement has hampered his progress. I think Wenger is too soft on most of these players. Its good to have a freeflowing style but none of them Ox Ramsey Wilshere Walcott Gibbs look intelligentaware enough to adapt fluidly both on defense and in attack. They all have one huge weakness which has not improved much over the years for any of them Composure and decisionmaking. Ox and Walcott are also not very intelligent players at all just athleticism.I think Wenger and his staff have really failed in developing these players properly even the ones that are not that talented naturally Gibbs Chambers should at least show improvement in footballing intelligence decisionmaking and take more responsibility.

I may overrate Campbell in comparison with Ox or I may do it because the first thing I think of is the assist he gave Giroud against Olympiakos. I hope the best for each player but Ox just seems like the kind of guy who practices only cool tricks and rarely if ever gets it right in a game.

8940033,0,t1_d7mf3f8,Well its difficult to close down crosses when you also have to worry about the initial ball carrier walking through on goal. You step toward him the ball is laid wide to the overlapper and you look like a fool. Happened with Aurier multiple times. When you are facing a fullback running at full speed and you are flatfooted due to the fact that you are marking the rightwinger not the fullback nobody is marking the fullback is that Monreals fault? He shouldnt be closing down Aurier unless there was a communicated switch with his winger. And unless Ox had a cell phone I dont think hes passing Aurier off to Monreal in a legitimate manner. Also does the fullback get any credit for being worn out due to facing multiple vs so when hes in an actual v against his man the RW it gets more difficult? If the poor tackles and mistimings are happening later in the match like when Monreal had to be subbed vs. Watford due to being gassed do we blame that on the fullback?    Ill go ahead and stand by Monreal and Bellerin I think they are getting flack that is mostly due to the negligence of the wingers and midfielders. They were arguably the best fullback duo in the league last year and unless your name is Ivanovic you dont just turn into a pumpkin overnight. Maybe Monreal is losing a step due to age and you are more correct than I but I dont believe that to be the case. I think once the midfield gets sorted all this talk about the fullbacks will fade away. ,Gunners,d7mgkmg,3,t5_2qhqt

Its really a good way because Sanchez runs to the left drawing defenders away and leaving a gap for Walcott to run from the right to the left while Bellerin starts running up to be a de facto winger.If you look at the passing map it looks like theres a lot of space to exploit but its not because these players are so quick that gap of space is pretty much an illusion.The real way to attack Arsenal is through Monreal.

I find the English media likes to attribute problems to mental causes way too often. Ozil is a good passer if the team around is good he will make everyone looks even better.

But it seems he is no longer able to complete a full season.  For someone who we rely on so heavily he should be able to play a full season or we need to spend time developing or finding another player who can make our team flow like he does.

9556844,0,t1_d9r2k2l,Well Im a well known Giroud fanboy but that is because my first option isnt pace. My ideal striker is a Target man. But looking past that just analyzing this season. Alexis has done well BUT not against teams that park the bus against us those are the games we need Giroud for. I have no idea why you think we should have scored  more goals against Tottenham. Our only chances were Iwobis shit shot Walcotts cracker and a Giroud header late on other than that...nothing at all. Tottenham should have routed us we had so many last ditch tackles to stop tapins. Main issue I see is Alexis against teams that sit deep and compact makes him useless. They push us out wide and we have a keebler elf in the box if he even gets in the box drops far too deep and no one to cross to. Against teams that actually try to play against us or against teams that will have more possession Barcelona Manchester City Alexis should start so we can counter attack. Basically each have teams they should play against. ,Gunners,d9r2sq2,2,t5_2qhqt
9557004,0,t1_d9r1xck,Probably he didnt find any of the candidates even outside those  worthy of his vote.

9557217,0,t1_d9r3qmy,The thing about our front  thats made it so effective so far in the season is that interchangeability. When Alexis drops deep Walcott makes a run through the middle and Ozil takes his place on the right. Iwobi comes in centrally Alexis moves wide. With Giroud in the side that changes. Ozil wont make as many overlapping runs when a winger cuts inside theres nobody to aid that flank if the opposition win the ball and counter. Hes good as a plan B if the tactics not the players arent working. If any of the front line are out of form or injured or suspended Id rather see a like for like switch like Lucas for Alexis Welbz for Iwobi Ox for Walcott unless again its the tactics that are the problem rather than the players.,Gunners,d9r4g7k,1,t5_2qhqt

9615296,0,t1_d9xy4t8,Where do people get this from. I apreciate counter views and discussion by the way. I just do not get where people get these kind of arguements. Ramsey has not played in his natural position in some time and the reason why I thought was really obvious......Santi does not play in the middle because he is better than Ramsey not making a claim either way but played in the middle because Ramsey is better than Santi on the wing. We have been playing a lopsided inverted winger since like  and santi lost his place in the squad due to his inability to play that position as well as our alternatives. Then in a string of injuries it was discovered that Santi is best if not second best option in the middle. This is not to say Santi is bad he is absolutley an elite player and one of the stars on our team its just at the time Ramsey was bagging goals and such in the middle and Ozil is out wide did not work as well as ozil in the middle pushing santi wide and then irrelevant.Ramsey is incredible in the middle there is no amount of positional awareness that can make up for playing next to players who can not keep up physically Arteta Flam Santi so to say he lacks mentality is a rash judgement. Ramsey is not the sitting midfielder but a box to box guy so he needs someone on the level of El Neny Coq Xhaka not to make up for his defensive instability but to be able to keep up with his physical ability and rotation. To use him to just win the ball is a waste and he is not holding metronome. He is a box to box player who injects vertical rotation with advanced players from deep and creates overloads third man runs breaking the lines etc.TLDR  Ramsey is incredible in the middle he and santi just do not pair well. Santi is not chosen not because he is better in the middle not making a claim for Ramsey being better but because Ramsey is better than Santi out wide and this is the best arrangement to fit RamseySantiOzil on the pitch at the same time.,Gunners,d9ya77t,5,t5_2qhqt

9658353,0,t1_da3fpm3,It was meant to be a punishment by Wenger for the Swiss red against Swansea. If you let him start that CL game it sends positive message to Xhaka subconsciously. Note that even when we were winning with a huge margin Wenger put Iwobi on as the last sub instead of Xhaka. The part I dont agree is that is never a red and Wenger should have defended Xhaka and appealed. Instead he wanted to teach a lesson and set the standard and boundary for Xhaka to follow. Once Wenger made that decision I believe it was a legit managerial move not to play Xhaka against the Bulgarian. ,Gunners,da3le72,2,t5_2qhqt

Not sure if it will be enough to keep a place in the team though.Xhaka was really good today improved in the secondhalf and his passes from deep into attack were very important in catching Bournemough on the back foot when they lost the ball.

We played really well today particularly going forward with the vertical passing from Xhaka into advanced areas where Ozil and Alexis could hurt the opposition. We were very fluid in our offensive play and the buildup to a few of our goals was absolutely extraordinary.Gibbs Xhaka Ramsey Ozil Alexis and Lucas all had great performances. Alexis was crucial in the buildup to  of the  goals. Gibbs was great going forward. Ramsey and Xhaka did well together in midfield. Ozil was magical today and his assist to Iwobi was something else. Lucas with a hattrick which will give him a lot of confidence now.On top of that of course PSG drew  with Ludogorets which means weve won our group. Couldnt have gone any better for us today.

9950916,0,t1_db4byy6,Ok Ill try to explain as a Chilean who opposed this tournament.The official Copa America was held in  four years after the previous one held in Argentina. The next official Copa America will be in .The  Centennial was just a way for Conmebol to get some cash. It was supposed to be played as a ceremonial tournament with the winner being considered just a winner of but the perception changed as the tournament went on. Most of the Conmebol officials who planned the tournament have either resigned or been charged with fraud. As a Chilean my issues with the  cup were that it would be unfair to the previous winners because it was now when the tournament began being considered as an official Copa America and would end up deligitimize Chiles  win just after one year. In the tournament draw Chile were not even seeded despite being the current winners and being ranked higher than two seeded teams USA was rightly seeded because they were hosting the tournament. There were rumours that the winner would take Chiles title as official champions Chile would have to stop using the winners badge in the shirt and even take their place in the Confederations Cup. That was talked a lot previous to the final mostly because everyone thought Argentina would win it. Conmebol had to make things clear because there was a lot of confusion which was mostly created by the Conmebol itself.At the end it didnt really matter because Chile won it too. It was also a big Fuck You to Conmebol.TlDr Copa America  was a cash grab a product of greedy and corrupt officials and unfair to previous winner who still won it anyway.,Gunners,db4mp14,4,t5_2qhqt

Wonderful player but these sorts of games pass him far too often  happy to dicuss that notion with anyone who thinks different.Back four were playing a different game to midfield second half as well.  Far too deep.  Way too much emphasis on defencehitting Citeh in the break.  Buck stops with Arsene on that one.When we get hassled in midfield we go to shit.  See Spurs at home United and Everton away and now Citeh away as well.  Weve had the same problem against weaker sides but have papered over the cracks with late goals and good spells of play leading to us putting ourselves back in the driving seat.

What about making some really nice saves when we were under pressure throughout pretty much the entire second half? When your team cant get the ball out of its own half and youre under constant pressure youre probably going to let in one or two goals at least. He made an incredible save on one shot that took a deflection I think it was from KDB where he had to hold his dive to take another step so he could reach the shot. Also on Sterlings goal his view was blocked by Silva.

Giroud is free to do whatever he wants but he will then be judged accordingly. This celebration reveals his mentality. He has done far more than Alexis in this game but is still heavily crucified. People do this for a reason. . This celebration talk actually shields him from the true problem. Whenever he starts we play like shit in the first hour of the game and have to beg a goal in the final minutes. There are no comfortable wins. The offensive play is very static and everybody around him looks shit especially Alexis Sanchez. Retrospectively starting a slow striker in an open battle against Bournemouth cost us the game even more so than the terrible defence.  ,Gunners,dbz1rk2,3,t5_2qhqt

10219657,0,t1_dc2dfo7,Oh I agree totally that Arsene has an annoying habit of gambling on player fitness and almost invariably losing but those arent generally responsible for the long term injuries and especially with Ramsey Wilshere and Debuchy the root causes were ridiculous tackles by teams rough housing us. Wenger is not blameless all the time but he gets far more stick than he deserves.This last game for instance we had no backup for Monreal as Gibbs is injured no backup for Bellerin as both our other right backs are injuredreading what our fans post about them. I think its clear there is something severely wrong with Jenkinson now and Maitland Niles was on the bench but you cant throw him in against an attacking side like Bournemouth. I understand the frustration with Kos but you must also see that getting Mustafi back into action probably then meant that Kos had to play to cover for any rustiness. In the end Gab was actually rather good but we all know the utter toxicity that would spew out here if Kos hadnt played and Gab had had one of his little moments.You can argue until the cows come home about squad rotation but the less you rotate the better your team gels especially the way we set up. You only have to look at Chelsea Liverpool this season and Spurs and Leicester last season to see what a relatively settled side can do.

10480829,0,t1_dcw35ox,Karanka at Real Madrid is a perfect example of tactically sound manager that can fill in if needed and can offer great tactical advice. And ... whats his face from Chelsea that actually lead them better. Wenger won everything when tactics in football were less important than today. Or are you going to argue that managers like Mourinho Pep Klopp dont put their mark on each game they manage? If you watch how many times they try to change their formations their total approach to the game  how many times do we change anything to chase the result? Yes we have a great capable squad that is rather self sufficient. But we would be CL title contenders with one of the names mentioned above. ,Gunners,dcw3z9m,1,t5_2qhqt

Tactics have always been important what changed was money. But thats not the narrative. Neither is the fact that we more than anyone in the league have saved and gained points from substitutions which rather suggests he knows how to change things in game.Then of course theres the fact that from his first game playing  through    and our current  hes used successfully well okay we didnt win anything with  but it was the banter years more formations than any of the current supercoaches below us in the league. Two of whom are still trying to shoehorn their ideas from other teams and leagues into this one.Ill give you that its not part of his philosophy to tailor his teams to the opposition but then neither do most of the top coaches Maureen being a notable exception and he has actually changed that for big games against City and Bayern in the past.

I honestly dont doubt the desire of any of these players or the manager Im sure they all want to win badly. Nevertheless I didnt have much faith in the starting  when the teams were announced. Has a ramsey coq duo ever worked? Can Ramsey play in a  man midfield with anyone other than the likes of Xhaka or arteta   a ball distributor type? I doubt it. Iwobi and Gabriel starting on the right hand side? Neither of them are particularly quickcapable of taking on the opposing fullback and Iwobi is unable to cut in from the right. Just seemed like a disjointed mess of a starting  cobbled together because those are the players he likes and that have performed well in the past. There should be more of a cohesive plan to it than that. Why does Lucas never get a run out in the prem? Or the ox seeing as he would have been brimming with confidence after his cup performance  and he would probably have done a better job than ramsey with coq or iwobi on the right. Not starting again after showing good signs and out of form players getting picked ahead of them would probably just demotivate those .

Wengers problem is that he keeps going back to this tired team selection even though hes seen it fail over previous seasons. Why cant he just stick with the kind of fluid players he was using in the beginning of the season.

10632820,0,t3_5s603f,The gripe with Wenger cannot be pinned down to mistakes in one match. Its his whole system the defensive shape how we attack how we defend training buying the right players and playing them according to their strengths. You mention that he cannot do any better than the lineup he fielded yesterday but what about the under performing players that he has kept at the club for years and years and some players that has the birthright to start every game no matter their form because they cost moreis his favorite. He constantly tries to skimp on buying REAL replacements and always tries to get on with makeshift players that arent necessarily playing in their best positions. No he doesnt have to spend m on every position to satisfy the fans but are you telling me theres no better keeper than Manuel fucking Almunia or maybe try buying a CDM earlier than making do with Flamini for a nd time after hes gone downhill?He couldve made small strides that couldve won us the league like buying a real striker last season when the usual league contenders were in disarray and all this monkey business would have been off his back but he didnt.

Back four Cech and Ozil have all been first choice options throughout the season.That leaves OxladeChamberlain Coquelin as the two positions potentially impacted by missing players.  But Xhaka missing due to stupidity not injury and El Neny is at the African Cup.  Coquelin may or may not have been a first team selection even if everyone was available.So I would say injuries cannot be seriously blamed for Arsenals poor performances right now.

10795785,0,t3_5ueldb,I saw both matches. While Barca did get blown out they were not as thoroughly dismantled as we were. PSG v Barca StatsBayern v Arsenal stats Barca had  possession amp  passes completed.Arsenal had  possession and  passes completed.We actually looked good for the first  minutes. We pressed high and made Bayern scramble in their own half and forced a few turnovers. I was concerned that when we did get the ball we had a hard time moving it down the field but thats to be expected given the circumstances. It made out to be a good match.  But then.... Bayern got a little bit too comfortable in our half. We sat back more and more instead of closing them down. Not sure if it was intimidation understandable or fatigue not excusable in the first half but eventually the high press decreased in intensity. Our defense wasnt terrible at this point but we have to admit  Bayerns first goal was pure world class. Far post just outside the box top left corner. I think it was so good that the players got totally demoralized. Coupled with our struggles with moving the ball that I mentioned earlier the first goal I think decided the match. The scrappy Alexis goal awarded on a very debatable penalty call was our last chance at salvaging anything.,Gunners,ddtib65,1,t5_2qhqt

10849887,0,t3_5v46qa,Since we always get overrun in midfield buying a technically good left back Bernat hopefully and a backtracking left mid Lemar? would enable us to have  players in central midfield areas allowing us to control games much easier.This formation would also enable us to play Alexis and Ozil as  creative midfielders and they can both drop deep as with Welbeck on they would no longer have to worry about forward prescence.Additionally we dont lose a lot of width since the two players accompanying Xhaka  Ox and Bernat are originally wide players so they can make overlapping runs with BellerinLemar. Defending would be done with a  formation with Xhaka and ox in the double pivot and Ozil Sanchez and Lemar in the attacking midfield. Ox would position himself towards the wing Ozil is located inI prefer to have Sanchez in the middle if were defending.,Gunners,ddz37u7,-20,t5_2qhqt

10851564,0,t3_5v3n25,It really depends on if we get a new manager in the summer or not whichever manager we get will want different players to replace certain positionsHowever on a general scaleGK  Cechs not good enough for the PL week inweek out any more. Szczesny needs to come back and take his first team place definitely our best keeper right now unless we can get a world class one or even Butland or Pickford who look like they might become greatFullbacks  If we continue to play  at the back we need backup for Bellerin. However if we get Allegri I can see us playing  at the back in which case we dont need one in my opinion. Potentially a new LB too Rodriguez potentiallyMidfield is fine. Ox Ramsey Cazorla Xhaka Wilshere Coquelin Elneny is enough. If we can find a Viera or Kante type player go for him if not fine. Definitely convert Ox to CM though his best positionWings  Upgrade needed here. Iwobi and Walcott are our starting wingers right now Iwobi is out of position and Walcott is good in my opinion but potentially not good enough to warrant a starting spot. Weve also got Lucas and Welbeck but both havent played enough this season to rely on them in the future.Sanchez and Ozil  If both go we need to replace them direly. Isco is the best replacement for Ozil by far wants to move for playing time and we can easily give that to him. Would love to get Lukaku up front if Sanchez goes probably wont happen but he would be deadly for us.Players to be sold If we sell Ozil and Sanchez we cant get rid of any others if we convince them to stay though Wilshere if he wants playing time we cant reliably give it to him.Ramsey Wenger will never sell him but other managers might not see a future in him I dont want him to go but he needs to show he can replicate his form for WalesWalcott Potentially high wages and not a guaranteed starter. Cant see anyone paying us enough thoughDebuchy and Jenkinson Both need to go offload them cheaply neither are good enoughMertesacker Probably wont play this season dont think hell get a game here again in the League either. Love the guy but dont see him here againOspina  Cech I like the guys attitude but I dont think Ospina has a future of being our  Szczesny is better than him and whilst he does put in good performances PSG away I dont think hes consistent enough to be our  nor is content being our cup keeper forever.

Yet these are the teams you are demanding that we compete with and be better than. We are just entering the age when Arsenal can spend a lot again. We are just at the beginning. But we are not there yet.  Besides its  thing to be happy with top . Its another to be unhappy with top  yet see the reasons for why its happening. Im not an idiot who thinks we can swing punch for punch with the big boys like United City Barca and Bayern.

11031815,0,t1_deiesd5,Tell that to the people posting stats of kante vs coq last season and even earlier this season... there isnt a comparison i know but i honestly dont understand why people rate Coquelin so highly when weve had central midfielders who clearly reflected the quality AFC are capable of having... players like Petit Edu Vieira and heck even Alex Song. I still remember during the whole Schneiderlin transfer saga I personally wouldve preferred having him over Coquelin simply because hes able to be physically imposing whereas coquelin has the physique of an athletic winger and pace hes fast too. Do you see the amount of times he gets bossed off the ball by other players in his position barring Hazard? Dembele Wanyama Matic.. all these guys have physicality. Coquelin just lacks that physical presence to be a dominating enforcer in the centre. Hopefully Xhaka will fill that role once he fully acclimatises to the premier league demands. P.s. I know it sounds like im shitting on Coquelin i sort of am but im not advocating for us to sell him.

Hes gotten us to where we are but the Emirates top flight of English football  doesnt seem that way though lol but he doesnt seem capable of advancing us any further CL being the biggest issue. Obviously we can get sentimental but i personally feel its time we part ways and try something completely different. Wenger just doesnt seem to want change in his philosophy over many things so its just getting repetitive. Also appreciate your honesty and actually sticking to your beliefs.

Lets not forget that we brought in great players like zil and Cazorla afterwards. For many years he was exactly the type of player we missed to win the league.  Van Persie was also misled by United because he wasnt aware of Fergusons intentions to retire and yet he stuck by them when they brought in the likes of Moyes and Fellaini.

In offense you have the goal and assist and maybe even the preassist. You can even throw in key passes and so forth. But with defense it is goals conceded. Bellerin could be conceded against as there was a counter down the opponents right flank where Monreal and Kosc are burned for pace. Nothing Bellerin could do about it but nonetheless accredited with a goal against him. As you know from reading the book you cited Im close to finishing it myself   soccer is a game of making your opponents make mistakes and then capitalizing on them. I believe mistakes is a metric followed by some data collection companies. It might be worth pooling mistakes and goals conceded together so yes Bellerin has a goal conceded but no mistake whereas Monreal and Kosc have both. ,Gunners,den56ho,4,t5_2qhqt

At Arsenal if its the clubs fault its Wengers fault.  The club have given him complete control over how everything runs so whether its the way the squad trains the way they play or the players that are bought and brought through the youth system no matter how you slice it its Wengers fault.Dont forget this is the same man who came in and revolutionised the diet and training of the players.  But that was  years ago.  Has he kept up with the latest in training methods?  Has his complete control over everything at the club prevented someone else from implementing the same changes as other clubs?gt Financial constraints.They were a factor  years ago  years is an entire football generation.  It took less than  years for Chelsea and Man City to buy the titles after dumping in loads of money and Arsenal already had a better starting position.Look who the top players by appearances were  years ago. Robin van Persie Wojciech Szczesny Theo Walcott Aaron Ramsey Alex Song Laurent Koscielny Mikel Arteta Thomas Vermaelen Gervinho Tomas RosickyOnly  of the  are still at Arsenal.If Arsenal had spent well why couldnt the club have had results similar to Chelsea or Man City?  If Arsenal had used the famous war chest earlier and more effectively what might have happened?The club is still carrying a massive amount of cash on hand.  Even when the club had money positions like DM went unfilled for ages.  This year the need for a CB was obvious but because of injuries and vacations the season opener vs. Liverpool used the th and th string CBs.The evidence is pretty damning that the reason Arsenal hasnt bought well has nothing to do with financial constraints and everything to do with an inability to assess the needs of the squad and go and buy the right players.gt Pretty terrible home support.Is it the stadium?  If so guess who gets the credit for the new stadium... Wenger.Is it the way the team plays?  If so guess who is responsible for how the team plays... Wenger.Is it the lack of superstar talent?  Again who makes the transfers?gt Very bad atmosphere amongst fans and poor attitude towards the manager which has been for about ten years not just the last two.If you want to know why see the above.,Gunners,deqei73,6,t5_2qhqt

Theres still a season to be played and a trophy to be won anyone not on board with that can GTFO this summer or sit on the bench until they are. Particularly Ozil and Alexis. Wherever their heads are we pay their very premium wages still and the season is ongoingMustafi needs to be dropped for Mert or even Holding based on his passed few performances. Id say the same for Bellerin but the drop off there is just too risky hence keeping him in the squad. I really do believe we need to start picking lineups based on form and attitude and not wages or stature. At the moment this is the line up Id roll out with and continue with until Ozil Alexis Monreal or Mustafi give me a reason to believe theyre ready to fight.    ,Gunners,deruglt,3,t5_2qhqt

However the nouveau riche and Man Utd are not immune to transition years where they are weaker and thus not putting up a strong a title challenge as other years we had two golden opportunities in  and .

11253089,0,t3_60m63b,I think our team has become reactionary. We do not fight or atleast pretend to play football until we are attacked by the opposition or concede to one of their goals such as a set piece. Even when we take the lead the growing arsenal one two attacks of the past where we would score back to back goals has decreased. And this I feel is largely due to the lack of attacking presence from the right hand side like Walcott and especially Bellerin. If you notice all our drive even Sanchez retards by the start of the D. When we do win a one on one is when we actually generate chances. This is largely the case when Ozil is absent. Unfortunately the only one daring enough to do is Alexis and Walcott may seem apt to do the same but his pace his only good without the ball and in the case of snapshots. If you notice we generally dominate the game only when the opposition doesnt sit back for the first twenty minutes. Our prowess of passing the ball quickly and piercing their defense is largely absent in the remainder of the half and slowly regresses into the sideways passing we used to identify LVGs United with. Commentators may call it probing and the usual way of walking it in but that isnt by choice its by circumstance. By creativity many of us identify it with Ozil but unfortunately it hasnt been consistent with only Alexis doing the work of running parallelly to the goal and dinking a pass over to Walcott and Iwobi. His real forte against big opponents lies only in persistence and perseverance. The OX centre mid performances the flurry of goals Ozil scored and the solid performances by Mustafi are all temporary and set in by circumstance and not actually driven by skill and tactic. Ox was dreadful against West Brom I know its one game but its games against Buses that counts Ozil ended his goalscoring after a slight injury Mustafi became predictable in heading the ball from the opponents goal kicks because Coq didnt take charge because hes forced to provide creative balls and runs in the absence of Santi.Excuse this long read but in TLDR terms we have become formulaic and predictable even with the likes of the twisting and turning Alexis.    ,Gunners,df7iri0,3,t5_2qhqt

11546937,0,t1_dg4s1sp,David Dein the former Arsenal vicechairman has held talks with American tycoon Stan Kroenke over selling his . per cent stake in the club The Daily Telegraph has learned.Kroenke according to sources close to the billionaire is still determined to buy the north London club despite the fact that the directors and major shareholders have made a pact not to sell to him for a year.The decision led to the controversial ousting of Dein last week ending  years at the club after his fellow directors accused him of misleading them over Kroenkes intentions.Dein who introduced the American sports tycoon to Arsenal last year as part of a marketing agreement with his Colorado Rapids Major League Soccer team believed Kroenkes financial backing could help the club compete with Chelsea and Manchester United.Arsenals statement explained that irreconcilable differences between Mr Dein and the rest of the board have necessitated a parting of the ways.Put simply Dein apparently supported a takeover by American billionnaire Stan Kroenke while the rest of the board were against it  at least for now.Two days ago there was a very secret board meeting at Arsenal where it was made clear to Dein that he had to go explains BBC Sport editor Mihir Bose.Dein has always wanted Arsenal to float on the stock exchange like Manchester United did but the rest of the board members including chairman Peter HillWood and major shareholder Danny Fiszman dont want that.Fault lines have developed within the Arsenal board over the last few years and clearly the intervention of Kroenke created a flashpoint.,Gunners,dg4uj24,6,t5_2qhqt

11557914,0,t1_dg55h3i,Exactly.  Individually none of the players is doing too much thats wrong but as a collective what theyre doing makes no sense.It makes perfect sense for a CB to go up to challenge for a header when the opposing team has a goal kick thats headed towards an opposing player who is a good header of the ball and is in a midfield position.  You dont just want to give away posession cheaply in that area and none of the central midfielders seem like theyd be able to win an aerial duel against an opposing striker.  When an Arsenal CB goes to challenge for a header in that position the rest of the team needs to adjust.If the opposing team is playing conservatively and has nobody else forward aside from that striker then maybe its fine for one fullback and one CB to stay back while the other CB challenges for the ball and the other FB pushes up.  That way theres a bit of safety but also a chance to quickly move the ball forward.On the other hand when the other team has a bunch of people ahead of the striker challenging for the goal kick the way it happened in every scenario here there need to be more Arsenal players dropping at least as deep as that CB challenging for the ball if not deeper to cover that position.This is something that you cant really organize on the pitch while things are in progress this needs to be something covered in training.It has often seemed to me like Arsenal doesnt actually do any situational training between matches.  The team doesnt seem to show up with a plan to handle specific threats the opposing side poses.  The set pieces seem to be generic ones that might have been practiced a few times in the summer before the season started.,Gunners,dg63dub,3,t5_2qhqt

Attacking patterns defensive patterns possession patterns pressing patterns free kicks taking patterns etc.. just replace pattern by tactics here.. but the thing is I dont recognize any! because . they dont exist . they exist but the players dont follow . they exist the players follow them but not all the time. I think its  and I think Wenger doesnt insist a lotdoesnt make the players follow  of the tactics  of the times.Knowing the tacticspatterns doesnt mean the overall gameplan can be found out and nullified.

In my mind we need to go for an under the radar commodity such as Hoffenheims Kevin Volland or Schalkes Donald Embolo. Both of those players have immense potential but are unlikely to warrant the same fees as an Aubamayang Morata Lacazette et all. A player like Volland would as well consider Arsenal a step up.   Im certain we can find the value in the market if we are able to identify it.

Spurs continue their growth under Poch and come excruciatingly close to winning the league in  before being foiled by Chelsea giving Leicester the league. Chelsea have a new manager and are running away with the league however SPurs continue to grow and are now legit contenders.

11805780,0,t3_68fykx,Ive had to mute the stream cos I cant stand these commentators wanking off spurs any longer. What did they say about the goal something about Alli being the future and he has a sixth sense or some absolute horseshit?,Gunners,dgy8573,13,t5_2qhqt
11805786,0,t3_68fykx,Might as well bring he subs in now ,Gunners,dgy862p,1,t5_2qhqt

11805949,0,t3_68fykx,Ramsey is an embarrassment to this club.  Daft flicks every time hes asked to control a ball and I genuinely dont see what his strengths are shooting? passing? its certainly not defending.,Gunners,dgy8u06,6,t5_2qhqt
11806071,0,t1_dgy98vz,I genuinely wouldnt be surprised if a  year old Vieira could play better than any of our midfielders,Gunners,dgy9bxx,1,t5_2qhqt
11806222,0,t3_68gm63,Incredible how a side with Denilson in midfield played better football than what weve witnessed today... ,Gunners,dgy9y34,4,t5_2qhqt
11806236,0,t3_68gm63,Wengers substitutions make me the most upset. Welbeck at right fucking wing back? What was bellerin doing once he replaced Gabriel? Didnt see any kind of formation for  minutes in the second half. Absolutely shocking management in a vital away game. ,Gunners,dgya056,9,t5_2qhqt

11806308,0,t1_dgya1iq,Our first half was good for a relegation side looking to delay the inevitable. I get we arent playing silky football anymore but at no point did Arsenal look good in the first half. Spurs were all over us the entire game. ,Gunners,dgyaape,9,t5_2qhqt
11806592,0,t1_dgyb7a2,Sadly papering over the cracks of the underperforming defense by throwing in extra bodies has exposed the cracks in the underperforming attack. ,Gunners,dgybgdn,30,t5_2qhqt

11807323,0,t1_dgycl4d,He doesnt owe it to me to give journalists stuff to report on. Youre only told that by the media because thats what they want.They demonise managers that refuse to play their games because they want stuff to report on thats why they love mourinho because he always gives them stuff. All this shows is how little he appreciates the media. So the media tell you that he doesnt appreciate you as well. ,Gunners,dgyefym,-2,t5_2qhqt
