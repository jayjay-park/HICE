3248451,0,t1_coydmxy,Hey thank you for doing this for me I really appreciate this. I just reread the chapter myself and I have to agree with you. Those first three chapters do drag on for a bit I always seem to want to open up with descriptions like that. Im trying to find the typos myself but I guess I have a very forgiving eye yet another sign that I need a beta reader.Im glad you enjoyed it though and were willing to take some time to leave a critique like this! Thank you so much!,FanFicCrits,coyplca,1,t5_2zqq8
