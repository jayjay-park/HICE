1035905,0,t1_chm1cgh,ampampamp Active Denial System sfw gtThe Active Denial System ADS is a nonlethal directedenergy weapon developed by the U.S. military  designed for area denial perimeter security and crowd control.  Informally the weapon is also called the heat ray  since it works by heating the surface of targets such as the skin of targeted human subjects. Raytheon is currently marketing a reducedrange version of this technology.  The ADS was deployed in  with the United States military in the Afghanistan War but was withdrawn without seeing combat.  On August   the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department announced its intent to use this technology on prisoners in the Pitchess Detention Center in Los Angeles stating its intent to use it in operational evaluation in situations such as breaking up prisoner fights.  The ADS is currently only a vehiclemounted weapon though U.S. Marines and police are both working on portable versions.  ADS was developed under the sponsorship of the DoD NonLethal Weapons Program with the Air Force Research Laboratory as the lead agency.   There are reports that Russia is developing its own version of the Active Denial System. gtgtImage i  Humvee with ADS mountedInteresting Nonlethal weapon | Directedenergy weapon | Air Force Research Laboratory | Nerve induction Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwchmcon oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletechmcon.

If were just basing it on that Russ might have had  although I suppose the value might have declined during the lawsuit but after the lawsuit ended the value of the company would have probably increased over that  million because of all the work they had put in since that time so I cant imagine Russ had more than  or so if he took his repayment in equity.,SiliconValleyHBO,cs71s1l,13,t5_311cs

You can customize it to highlight syntax keywords of many different programming languages you can write macros to insert functions or snippets of code you use it as a basic word processor like MS Word or you can get more fancy and plug in the LaTex work environment into it which is a very strong codebased document preparation system that allows you to have a high degree of control over how your document looks like most commonly used by people writing scientific papers or theses.If that was too complicated think of Emacs as MSWord but with a ton of functionality which you can really only unlock using codebased commands as opposed to buttons in a ribbon.

8080566,0,t3_4pu780,I cant say that I agree all that much. I mean i like the character in that he is entertaining and good for the show. But i wouldnt want to work for him or be related to him.  I also find the connective tissue that link them fairly threadbare. Theres debate and potential for Richard to find great success and wealth in Silicon Valley and become a power player to be firmly placed in Gavin Belsonlike shoes. But to turn out exactly like him? To me its a stretch.  Richard is passionate about his tech and is driven by it... all consumed by it.. but even when he believes that his version of the platform is better than people perceive it to be... thats still light years from the narcissism that Gavin displays. And that narcissism compounded with his penchant for the pattern of emotional abuser mean as a snake until he realizes hes totally fucked upgone too far and then hes totally honey lipped and faux compassionate is what made that first pitch so congenial complimentary to Richard but at the same time highly manipulative and full of lies.   The things that stick to me about Gavin are how he repeatedly lies to his own board. The way he treated the Nucleus team and the impossible expectations he put on them before FIRING them but turning that into a martyr act.  ...Using the intel from the Hooli security officer that was illegal yet treating him like shit just to commit corporate espionage. The whole situation where he bought Endframe who was by then spearheded by the exNucleus heads who had been Hooli employees  before that... not recognizing them at all and again throwing irrationally impossible expectations on them once they saw PPs platform looking to have everything PP had AND beating them to market. Hes also doctoring Hoolis own search engine scrubbing the web of negative press and possibly reading any Hooli employees email he wants inferred in that episode. Perhaps Im tainted because Ibe worked for some very self important out of touch irrational bosses in my time that have been very manipulative and morally bankrupt people both in their personal lives and in business practices...but he strikes me as a terrible person and while I enjoy him in the show... the chaos he creates the antics he has and their ripple effect... I dont root for his character. And i certainly dont see it as a foregone conclusion that Richard for all his faults has to become just like him. ,SiliconValleyHBO,d4obx6y,2,t5_311cs

And the field in comedy is pretty strong. Idk who was nominated but shows like IASIP Broad City South Park Atlanta Better Things Vice Principals Veep Love and Im sure Im leaving out a bunch that are just slipping my mind since not many comedies that I watch are in season rn but point is theres a bunch of shows that could have won. Seems that the critics just love the writing or Mike Judge or the cast  or all three. Not to mention the fact that theyve anointed TJ Miller as the new Ricky Gervais a smart comedic outsider who doesnt shy away from taking risks and making the audience uncomfortable.

I run my own business and there is a strong desire to create or be a part of something awesome something others will know you by.I remember watching The Martian and thinking this was based on a book and how amazing it must have been for the author see his work turn into something like that.

11723006,0,t1_dgoteyl,But thats what I dont understand. It wasnt Richards algorithm to trade away it belongs to the company. PiperChat just sold off their most valuable asset to someone they fired. Why do this at all? As you said now PiperChat cant pivot unless Richard approves it. They just fucked themselves!Although I have to remember this is TV and Bachman has no other way to claw his way to majority control otherwise. Seems weird that hed fuck over his own company for all this but he smokes about as much pot as I do so I guess I can rationalize why this is all so unorthodox.,SiliconValleyHBO,dgotzud,5,t5_311cs
