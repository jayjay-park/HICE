9343374,0,t3_57p0p6,Thanks for the replies guys! I have been doing some research and looking at what my employer is saying. Looks like they have to prove I wasnt trying my hardest or giving my best. Which obviously being  months pregnant I am trying very hard to keep my job! This is reassuring to hear from others at any rate. ,EmploymentLaw,d90c8ds,1,t5_3c1sl
