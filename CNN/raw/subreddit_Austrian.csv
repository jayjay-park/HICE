1093735,0,t1_chslb7g,gt I have read many published regressions that are grounded in crap theory but they get published anyway. Well just because you dont agree with the specific theory that its grounded in doesnt exactly invalidate the methodology. Ive also seen many regressions grounded in theory I didnt agree with. As for this central planing vs. free market stuff well Im a financial economist. I work at a bureau which advises institutional investors. On one hand we would care more about the bottom line than about any ideology here but on the other hand we dont suppose that theres no such thing as a complex model or that complex models do not represent the free market. Complex models usually mean markets where endogenity heteroskeasticity or other concrete technical issues need to be dealt with in order to advise our clients well given that that they expect to be executing largescale ie potentially pricemaking diversified investments and investment stategies into a highly complex marketplace. The math is complex because the market is complex. ,Austrian,chsm10x,2,t5_2vj5n
