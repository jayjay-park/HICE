2429959,0,t1_cmbrtgo,I have an IPV  right now but was looking into getting a rDNA  from vaporshark. I never break gt  and casually drip at . ohms and  watts but thanks for the insight. Should I just put my money into a better dripper than my igow? ,vapehardware,cmc1t1o,1,t5_352vl
7259304,0,t3_41fywi,Honestly I think you may have a defective unit. Ive had the w iStick for a little while and its been beautiful. However it is my fourth iStick product. I had the w mini which my dad commandeered and which still works fine which I then replaced with the w mini. The threading in the w stripped in no time and the thing is now useless. After that I got the w which worked fantastically and still does. But the fire button is noticeably worn out and compacted into the body after less than  months. I now rock the w at home and an iStick basic on the go. I think iStick and eleaf is a great brand but theyre also a budget brand. If you get a good iStick itll treat you well but they definitely have some quality control issues to be aware of.,vapehardware,d23by2j,1,t5_352vl
