10287110,0,t3_5nagjp,There are SO many things so Im just gonna summarize some minor thingsAside from excellent horse mechanics Im really hoping that this game rewards thorough exploration with meaningful upgrades not just items. We already know that the bombs and stamina meter can be upgraded and Im hoping that Nintendo really went all out with that i.e. upgrading stamina to the point where together with foodpotions you could go a LONG time without worrying. Weve also seen items that increase movement speed so Im quite hopeful that they did !Also REALLY looking forward to the desert death mountain and ESPECIALLY the gorgeous and giant Lake Hylia. Cant wait to explore those areas and Im hoping for many surprises!Im just generally hyped for this game and nothing even if my hopes arent fulfilled will change the fact that this will be a game of great quality and hours of fun! Edit I dont think theyve shown us every rune yet. There must be more and the slots can be switched out. And if not those we got are AWESOME and I personally dont really wantneed more.,Breathofthewild,dca3m9e,3,t5_3f1pg
