In high school this includes any crossing of the neutral zone by the defense whether contact is made or not. It is a violation of the games code. It is similar to offside except when it occurs the play is not allowed to begin.

824812,0,t3_22loh8,Really like this video. It raises a few things.. As one that thinks Alaska should have been apart of Canada not USA yeah yeah unamerican but cmon guys look at the map tell me Im wrong and heck Canada wants to give USA oil as it is and for less as well as the rest of the world I love how he has that as an example. Shame thought its Russia what Alaska was bought by the USA Russia wanted to have a bid war with UK but British didnt want it thanks... from and not Canada.. That in the s it will be interesting to see what happens but I doubt it will be big thing as China would just make em into another capitalist zone and leave as is as much as possible likely government systems gone olympics gone for HK etc but keeps economy as is. Heck it might be a whole new free and open non communist china federation or confederation still intact unlike USSR and Yugoslavia that still gives them a level of self government looking to take back in Taiwan and maybe more.. big one. This whole idea of one country two systems. It makes me wonder why its not being used in other such disputes by Europe and others minus the  year limit in most cases. There are many cases where it could be used like Gibraltar Las Maldeinas Argentina should make a similar offer to UK for them Mayotte American Samoa united with Samoa as one divided by systems and it goes on and on.

1012683,0,t1_chj8o6l,To answer that argument have two points Accelerating data traffic from certain sources is still biased in that the ISP has the ability to accelerate all data equally but chooses not to which is in effect slowing down the other traffic relative to the fast lane. They would have to explicitly block other traffic from going through the fast lane and assuming that no extra infrastructure is built this is precisely the same as artificially slowing down selected traffic. If they in fact did have the capability to create a fast lane by the above it would necessitate new infrastructure. Yet if the ISPs were willing to build that new infrastructure in order to create a fast lane for trafficheavy sources this wouldnt even be a discussion. If they wanted to build new infrastructure for a fast lane or not then theyve already acknowledged that the profits from the traffic would outweigh the costs to build the infrastructure. But at that point if the benefit is simply more cable to combat network congestion the traffic source still isnt important meanwhile if the benefit is better cables with higher bandwidth then interested customers would simply pay for use of that service as we already do once again regardless of the data being sent.,CGPGrey,chjedqy,1,t5_2u93l

1156528,0,t3_27a9yn,in Greek its a far more complicated mess.        First off we use different unrelated words for grandparents instead of adding a presuffix to the words for the parentsso you have  mitera for mother and  pateras for father but  yaya for grandmother and  pappous for grandfather. And then you just add the prefix  pro which also happens to be the root of pre every time you go back a generation. so your  is your greatgreatgrandfather.    and then theres a whole other set of words to describe the inlaws instead of just using a prefix.       So your parentsinlaw are your  pethera your motherinlaw and your  petheros  your fatherinlaw. These two are also collectively reffered to as your  petherika which is a plural neutral noun.        Then for your siblingsinlaw you have your  kouniada your sisterinlaw and your  kouniados your brotherinlaw.From that point and on we stop using new words it was about time for that wasnt it? and instead add the phrase   ex anhistias which means by marital connection at the end of the normal word. So your grandfatherinlaw is your    and so on for every other inlaw relation.        Oh and i almost forgot to mention the words for children and grandchildren are also unrelated. Your children are your  pedia which is in an interesting etymological twist is the root of the pedia in enclyclopedia but your grandchildren are your  engonia. But instead of using the same prefix as for great grandparents we say  thisengonathe th pronounced like in the not like in theory meaning twice grandchildren for great grandchildren and  trisengona meaning thrice grandchildren for great great grandchildren.        And such are the upsanddowns of speaking such an ancient language thats probably too complicated for its own good but also kinda beautiful.,CGPGrey,chzq53v,0,t5_2u93l

This is where every citizen of a country receives a cheque for x amount from the government irrespective of their situation.This would have the advantage that we would not see any unemployed people starving on the streets yet it would also avoid the biggest pitfall of unemployment insurance  benefits  the issue of the incentive to work.Under the current system in the UK the more you earn the less benefits you can get. This means that for someone who has been on unemployment benefits their effective marginal tax rate is very high as high as a  rate of taxation. Whilst how much marginal tax rates can affect work ethic can be disputed they undoubtedly do reduce the incentive to work an extra hour a week.Basic income solves this main problem as since it is unconditional it is not withdrawn under any circumstances. This means that people will always be better off working than not working which in theory means that peoples work ethic in unchanged by it.,CGPGrey,cjp0mia,19,t5_2u93l

1665161,0,t3_2dc31k,My trouble with Monkey Copyright ends up pivoting on art installations.  At least thats what lead me to this.  What if someone made a photobooth that kept pictures.  According to a friend of mine when it comes to copyright of photographs the person who takes the photo that is presses the shutter release owns the photo.  So when something that cant own copyright triggers a camera to take a picture who owns the picture?  I can think of several situations where this might be the case.  First dropping the camera?  Well that seems pretty cut and dry.  Its your camera you get to keep the picture.  Claim it was performance art and its really yours.  Second Game and Wildlife cameras.  Theyre triggered by movement.  You own the camera and set up its trigger to be movement.  Most things that set it off will not be able to retain copyright.  So.. You own the picture of the Raccoon.  Now what if a PERSON sets off that camera?  Do they own copyright since they triggered the camera?  Does intent matter which leads to the next question.Imagine someone knows theres a security camera.  And then they intentionally get into the picture.  They triggered the shot.  Do they get to keep that image as their own?  How about if theres someone in the field of view when that dropped camera takes a picture?  Now for giggles Id love that monkey to own the copyright.  And have wikimedia send some poor intern out to get the monkeys consent or pay the monkey for it.  But I think in the end the camera operator should get the copyright.  It was his camera he brought it there and he put the monkeys in the situation where they could take the picture.  He was most responsable for the image.  ,CGPGrey,cjp1zyw,2,t5_2u93l

1753309,0,t3_2dwl6s,I think there are a few problems with your solutions to the whole automation thing. First I should say that I agree that in a civilized society there is a certain threshold we should maintain all members of that society. That said it almost sounded like what you were suggesting would deviate into an unpalatable situation where the vast swaths of the unemployable would be relegated to remaining forever in that class. The result of which would be a very unAmerican like strict division of classes where no one who is in the underclass could ever break free from the chains of it. While it is true even now that it is the exceptional person who breaks free from the chains of poverty to become something objectively viewed as financially successful it is indeed possible and one of the American dreams that remain central to the heart of every American. I would hate to live in a society where  of the people were unemployable and were supported... by whom? The problem is one that you and Brady were touching on....even if McDonalds automated everything if we eliminate jobs for most kinds of work we get to a point where we also eliminate customers and then no one is making any money even wealthy corporations and CEOs.There is a role for government to play here and I do not believe it requires being anti technology or creating a larger welfare state than we have ever had before with implications we cannot even imagine right now. Changes in the tax code would create different incentives for companies to make money. For instance increasing the capital gains tax could provide more incentive to invest human labors and devaluing investment income. The barrier to possible tax code solutions is political. We dont have the political will to do so because of course politicians get more money from people who like the tax code the way it is. Im still personally optimistic. Because to not be is just too depressing!Anyway I love your new podcast and have enjoyed watching your youtube videos. I even joined reddit on your suggestion lol.

1858952,0,t3_2ftuby,Badly written unimportant rant about me not liking the first ep of Black MirrorI paused the podcast just to watch Black Mirror and Im extremely disappointing with the quality of the script. The prime minister would never ever do that. YouTube would take down the video globally. After weve been told the YT video was taken down we see a guy watching it. Yes it could be a recording of the whole YouTube website but that seems unlikely. I think the entire thing was rather in your face.The guy just conveniently standing at the door next to all the police taking a picture of the guy. How would they allow or miss that? They excuse the whole sex with a pig thing with some bs about it becoming illegal to have the video of it afterwards. Well if its that easy to take down a video how did this thing start in the first place?The finger part is also really dumb. The news station would never show a cut off finger that would just not happen. If he uploaded it to YouTube it would be taken down in minutes as they dont allow that stuff. The only way you can spread videos like that is though torrents and that would significantly reduce the amount of eyeballs on it. Even then the government can just block the website sharing the torrent link. Yes there are ways around that but most people dont understand torrents more than that magnet icon on the pirate bay.The raid was also really dumb. She wouldnt be able to run away because theyd have the building surrounded.I could go on but there are just so many details that are completely wrong and lazily done.

2217591,0,t1_cllnszc,It varies country by country. The most common way is to take all the votes and county all the nd preferences and divide them proportionally. So say for simplicity sake you had  surplus votes thats what they call the extra votes if a candidate has reached the thresholdquota. Also for simplicity the election threshold was  votes. You count the nd preferences and find that  people wanted candidate A  wanted B  wanted C and  wanted D. Those votes are then represented as a percentage i.e. in this case A  B  C  and D . You then divide the surplus votes by this percentage so out of the  surplus votes A gets  B gets  C gets  and D gets . Although as Grey explains in his video some votes may be nontransferable which I didnt take into account for simplicitys sake.In some STV systems like in Ireland a less scientific system is used. They literally take the extra votes and redistribute only them. So say the candidate have  votes and when they counted the last box he got  votes. The last  votes that were counted are considered his surplus and are assumed to be representative of the whole population.

One thing to add as a second piece to this is that other people are often only meaning to argue we should move this way and what theyre saying is the extreme on that side is better than the other.So if you see someone advocating radical socialism it might actually be that their ideal is to tweak their county slightly more to the left and they think the best way to argue this is by arguing very forcefully for something more extreme.Second thought Its perfectly possible for two people to live in slightly different contexts that makes both of them quite reasonable in wanting to move the equilibrium in opposite directions. I live in a centreleft country so I advocate rightwing policies you live in a centreright contry so you advocate left wing policies. It seems like were disagreeing but we both want the same centrist policies.Scott Alexander has an awesome post on this,CGPGrey,co8m0y4,2,t5_2u93l

3653852,0,t1_cq8r5e9,I realise that if every youtuber had to pay a compulsory subscription it would be very lucrative.

So ads are probably more lucrative as barely anyone will subscribe.,CGPGrey,cq8rk3y,1,t5_2u93l
3656318,0,t3_324law,I dont underestimate the value of ad free content. Ads are annoying to me in large part because the traditional response to declining ad revenue has always been then show more of em. This cramming in more commercials to compensate for lower revenue once motivated me to drop cable television years before it became common enough that the media decided the phenomenon needed a name. Before that it stopped me listening to the local radio. Depending on the show it can sometimes motivate me to buy a season pass for a TV series though not always since Im the sort of person who typically watches an episode once so the idea of owning a series provides little value to me and it really is the adfree nature of purchased content that motivates me and not any sense of collectable value. I even passed when Hulu Plus came out as soon as I heard that the content still had ads even if you paid. Having said all that youd think Id give this a glowing recommendation but I do worry somewhat about individual service providers each charging separate subscriptions for ad free content. I understand why theyre doing it. I actually do wish them the best. I hope not too many people share my reservations so they can find an alternative business model to the hypercommercialization hell things inevitably tend to degenerate into but if it works and if every competing content delivery service wants to do the same do we get to a point where too many hands are asking for a piece of pie? That seems like it will be just as bad as boring us with more ads than the amount of content merits.What Id love to see happen and of course what Im sure never will happen is some universal ad opt out that you pay a single subscription and all content providers verify your account and credit you a certain amount of ad free content for a cut of the subscription. Im curious though how YouTube would feel though if the deal they offer their content creators split your part of the profits based on how much people access your content were suddenly turned on them split your portion of the subcription fees based on how much time people spend at your website versus competing websites also honoring this system. I suspect theyd far rather get the guaranteed full  if people will pay it. And so would every other service provider which is where it all falls down of course. Ah well. Big mean old reality cant stop me from dreaming. ,CGPGrey,cq91nys,1,t5_2u93l

Cognitive threshold. Grey sees things a certain way and no matter what Brady says hes almost physically unable to see them the other way. I imagine it works like an optical illusion. Brady sees two faces while Grey sees a chalice and theres no way around it.But on this episode. This particular episode when Grey started talking about how The Martian amazing descriptions on science and tech felt like Star Trek technobabble to him. Ugh! I lost it. For me theres no possible WORST analogy than comparing the Martian to Star Trek. If theres any sort of spectrum on scifi hardness with Star Trek on one end the Martian would be so freaking far on the other end it would blow the window off.And whats tragic is that I can see why would Grey feel this way and also how theres nothing we can do to make him see the two faces rather than the chalice.Sorry Grey.

5453543,0,t1_cw542l4,I was speaking about the ad topic with a friend who has a problem wherein they can only pay for Internet on their mobile devices and not a dedicated home access point. We are students if it provides context.The problem is this person only has gigs of data. His usage is relatively low email Wikipedia research scholarly research current events research but his data consumption seems to be rather high. After getting it investigated by a mutual friend of ours it seems that not only have the ads followed him and in fact subscribed him to themselves without his agency but they are now HD videos in so and so seconds. That causes a problem where the data is loaded in its entirety as part of the page he is visiting without his choosing to summon and see the video ad. Without the distraction factor this has now intruded upon him as a person who is underpaid as a fellow teachers assistant.How do morals factor into this if one is to have a moralethical argument? I find it much of an imperative to ask this because while Myke is trying to attribute morality into the issue he did later added that he doesnt care for right or wrong and that the issue at hand for him has his only solution due to his conflict of interest as a creator so is reliant on ads for a living. P.S. I also use an adblocker I make it an exception to enable nonintrusive ads on the creators personal website like CinemaSins if I am able to get their content away from the main YouTube hub. Podcast ads arent intrusive because they are generally short and sweet and occasionally charismatic and actually serve the function of a sort of chapter marker. Them not stalking me like some Doctor Who alien creature and trying to shove unneeded products or services into my brain is a plus. ,CGPGrey,cw8qq9p,1,t5_2u93l

Youtube actually has an algorithm that detects silence in videos and will place an ad there if possible rather than interrupting the video midsentence like it sometimes does.Or at least it used to have such an algorithm. A few times when I was watching the SciShow Quiz show Michael Aranda would say something like Well be back after the commercial break after which they put a silent title card for a couple of seconds and that was always precisely where YouTube would put a video ad. I remember seeing things like this in videos from other channels too though I dont remember any specific one.EDIT yep YouTube still does that. I just opened a random SciShow Quiz Show video and skipped to a few seconds before the yellow line that YouTube puts to let people know when the ad will play and granted it was right after Michael announced the commercial break.

Ive used the service quite heavily for the passed week or so and have to say it is convenient but would not be worth the price tag if I did not also use GPMAA so heavily. The background playing of videos is a nice addition so I can listen to more word heavy videos during work or if I need to respond to a text message. Ive used the offline setback feature twice and only played one of the videos offline. I could see the appeal if you spend most of your day away from a WiFi connection but I dont see many people using this function. The music side is fairly good. From what I can tell its basically Spotify but with a few add ons. They have these mood stations that rotate throughout the day and seasons so you can play some music for getting pumped up at work or some romantic music on fridaysaturday nights if you are having dinner with your spouse. You can also upload your own audio files to the player and access them from the webpageapp. I would not buy YouTube red unless you would heavily use the offline playback or heavily use the music subscription.

5768101,0,t1_cxbe36r,But human agency is decidedly not random. If humans were random the population distribution would be equal over the entire globe. Most people like to live near food and water and make conscious decisions to move about in a nonrandom manner to assure those two resources. The Syrian refugee crises is a modern example of a large group making a conscious choice to attempt to move somewhere else would you say they are moving at random? Agency is not random though agency may be unknowable. When dealing with other cultures there are tons of decisions that youll find that appear nonsensical yet were considered common sense within certain groups. And consciously or not those ideas were chosen to be accepted and acted on or in some cases rejected Christopher Columbus is a good example of rejecting common sense.The goal behind accepting human agency is to reject the idea of inevitability. In a sense it is randomness but its the randomness of the individual sometimes acting in massive numbers. There wasnt a super genius who said lets settle here though in some cases there was although the genius part is always questioned but that doesnt mean that there was no direction. A mass of individuals each making their own decision has moved history history is not the exclusive playground of the elite. Those random choices add up to very large effects.,CGPGrey,cxc3471,2,t5_2u93l

6393291,0,t1_cykdbww,I dont think Grey rereads the reddits after the first few days but I thought your question was worth responding to so Ill jump in as anyone else here.I would say the differences in technology are because AfroEurasia has always been at least  of the population of the world.  Most sources Ive found say AfroEurasia was at least  of the population of the world until the th century.  Most of the populations of AfroEurasia were interconnected and there was always some exchange of ideas.  Europeans didnt develop metallurgy writing or the sail on their own those ideas entered Europe from the Middle East.  Gunpowder and the compass came from China.  Some technologies also flowed out of Europe and thats the point there was a free exchange of technologies.  There were also crops being freely exchanged on the AfroEurasian landmass wheat was first domesticated the Fertile Crescent rice in China as well as domesticated animals horses were domesticated in the Eurasian steppes chickens in India pigs in what is now Iraq.From the time the Bering Land Bridge became impassible until the Columbian exchange the peoples of the Americas were isolated. The couldnt take part in the exchange of technologies crops animals or diseases occurring in AfroEuroasia.  Any idea or technology or good they developed had to be developed on their own without help from the other  of humanity.  Start a moon colony of  people and keep them isolated from Earth for a few thousand years then let them meet up.  While have a starting population of  billion people developing new ideas and technologies theyll have .  Theyll probably come up with some impressive new technologies on their own but theyre on their own.  Theyre missing out on all the developments were creating.Its a little silly for Grey to say what if we move the domesticable animals across the sea?  The Americas are only  of the landmass of the world.  If you randomly assign domesticable animals to points on the map  of them are going to be in Afro Eurasia.,CGPGrey,czgcn2o,1,t5_2u93l

6522573,0,t3_438ib1,So theres this anecdote I hear from Geography professors Harvard no longer has a geography or geography exclusive department because Geographic Determinism does not hold water. Geography is an important aspect of human historical development but humans also effect their environment. So in the way our environments shape our development so too does our development shape our places. Geographic Determinism was born partially out of a desire to prove the superiority of Europe and the inferiority of cultures that were deemed to be inferior in the late th and early th century way of thinking. Geographic Determinism was a simple onesizefitsall theory that also happened to prove that Europe was the font of all that is superb and Africa because its warm was a hearth for laziness that did not require ingenuity to overcome.While Diamond doesnt approach this level of Determinism some of his arguments are sneered at as an artefact of the derision felt for the lack of nuance presented in the more prominently accepted deterministic theories in the th century.,CGPGrey,cztzhu4,1,t5_2u93l

Hence lots of paperwork There are obvious reasons for this of course  tax evasion  and no obvious solutions to rationalize it. Unless you simply say you dont care about individuals with means exploiting the resulting loophole.Current social commentary  particularly in regards to a specific subset of individuals i.e. corporations  says people would care.

You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murrays case physics. In mine show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backwardreversing cause and effect. I call these the wet streets cause rain stories. Papers full of them.In any case you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story and then turn the page to national or international affairs and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read.

This would be the ideal outcome for international business and collaboration though Ive also heard EU will likely be punitive to dissuade other Eurosceptics thus making it difficult.

8286752,0,t1_d5d6kt2,. This is a good point but UKIP were definitely the driving force to put the idea of a referendum in the public eye. The petition got more signatures than UKIP did votes in the  election and .x more than the SNP had to get  seats so Id say that it cant be discounted. Cant comment on this without a legal background but umilomidnight has a good point below. I dont think there is a need to go into specifics about the nature of the deal I interpreted it as a no precedent idea. The cabinet was generally for in though. Just to note that Business for Britain are leave campaigners. Id say that the current prime minister having campaigned to stay is fairly relevant at least as an indicator of her personal preference for the future relationship between the UK and the EU. Anecdotally I know a fair few people who voted leave and regretted it and none the other way. I doubt any of the campaigners regret it though. . He was a major player in this whole game I think his resignation is somewhat relevant although not very admittedly. Cant really guess what the actually thoughts of the upper echelons of the conservative party are but I think that prime minister became at least a slightly less desirable job after the referendum. Still true though the point is that nothing happens until we say it. Yeah democratic suicide to formally deny it though.. Yes but uncertainty about the UKs economic future is pretty high now as a direct result of the referendum and associated lack of a cohesive public plan for exiting. I think  is too high but I wouldnt be very surprised if it did happen especially if we do go full brexit and become entirely independent which I think is unlikely. Dont know not too familiar with the associated politics and public opinion but in a full brexit situation I think there will be a pretty good chance.. They are a little bit stalling for negotiation time. I dont think that it is very possible that it will continue indefinitely especially with the new department. Depends what you mean by brexiteers I think that a good chunk of the leavevoting populace especially those convinced by the migration arguments would be unsatisfied with that as a result.. Maybe a tiny bit true but yeah really a misrepresentation of the situations. Again I think a significant chunk of those who voted for brexit rather than those who campaigned for it would be unsatisfiedAs you may have guessed I am fairly strongly on the remain side. I dont think that the vote was catastrophic but I have yet to be convinced that it will be a net positive for most people  although I dont think it is much of a net negative either. ,CGPGrey,d5deidf,2,t5_2u93l

So assuming that ftl travel is impossible that rules out interplanetary civilizations.Okay so what about evidence of singleplanet civilizations? Well sure given the age of the universe there has been time for civilizations to develop but Im not convinced it would be easy to see them. We can only see exoplanets from gravity or light changes from transits. The only way we could possible detect a civilization would be from unnatural radio signals. Now thats assuming that the civilization evolved to use radio communication which is pretty reasonable. However as we can see from our own development that we only leaked powerful radio signals into space for a short amount of time. Its very energy wasteful to just broadcast signals out in all directions. So we would have to be very lucky to be just the right distance away from a civilization to pick up when they were being in efficient at the beginning of their use of radio communications. Not to mention the inverse square law would make any such signal super super faint compared to the already very faint signals from normal astronomical objects. Even a civilization that is a billion years more advanced than us that was trapped on their own planet because theres no ftl travel might know that we are here and be able to observe us with their magic technology but we just have no way of seeing them. Even if they wanted to communicate with us they might be so different and so advanced that they literally couldnt fathom a way to communicate with us and even if they did it would be through a beamed radio signal that would take literally yearsdecadescenturiesMillenia for a oneway communication. In conclusion the solution to the Fermi Paradox is that space is just really really big and contact between even plentiful civilizations is simply super unlikely. ,CGPGrey,d763bkl,2,t5_2u93l

How many folks from NJ NY CA or TX stayed home or voted for a rd party with no prayer of winning because they new their state was already a foregone conclusion?All the players candidates and voters knew the rules going in and played the game that way. Clinton amp Trump would have hardly spent much time or money in North Carolina had the rule been popular vote and would have instead chosen to pile on extra voters in whatever areas were their strongholds.

10885514,0,t3_5vc6vh,uMindofMetalAndWheels Just on using scrum on a team of one. I am a software developer and I lead a team using scrum everyday.The benefits I feel for an individual is first all planning is done up front at the start of the working cycle sprintiteration. We take a story we want to complete and break it down to individual tasks we need to complete to finish the work. So after day  we no longer have to think about how to complete the story and concentrating on the discreet tasks instead.Second benefit is all the tasks are in a list in the order they should be completed. So its very easy to know what to work on next. When you are finished a task you just take the next one off the top queue. Again no thinking.Next benefit is in figuring out how long it will take you complete certain tasks and how much work you can get done in your iteration. Part of planning is putting an estimate on how long you think a thing will take. You then correct this number when the task is finished.It is important to a have a reviewretrospective at the end of every iteration. With the review you can check that you actually completed the work as you planned and check your estimates vs the actual time to help you with future planning. With the retrospective you can examine your processes and self correct where you see problems.If you can get these benefits out of your own process then the overhead of scrum might not be worth it to an individual. But as a team it can work really well.,CGPGrey,de2rhmb,2,t5_2u93l
