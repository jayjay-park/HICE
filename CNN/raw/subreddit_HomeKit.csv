8878747,0,t3_4s316s,I just found this using google cache seems the updatefirmware is about to drop any day now ,HomeKit,d7f3mj6,1,t5_3218m
8933891,0,t1_d7lfxis,awesome thanks. It was just coincidence that I opened the app today after installing iOS  and it offered me ... Ill chill out and wait for a firmware update. And Ill remember to open the Schlage app more often. ,HomeKit,d7lpzmt,1,t5_3218m
9112606,0,t1_d831fyr,Yeah its definitely odd. My Sense magically reappeared for a couple days but now its gone again. I hope Schlage at least acknowledges the issue. ,HomeKit,d876rlf,1,t5_3218m

9853920,0,t1_darykdu,The way these homemade accessories work is by having the device run code that publishes or subscribes to an MQTT topic and then HAPNode just acts as the link between MQTT and your iOS device.I dont have a thermostat at home we live in relatively subtropical climate and whole home heating or cooling arent really a thing so its difficult for me to try to figure out what the problem is. Is there. I way to get the device registered with the app?I am looking into changing the thermometer accessories into thermostats and Id like to try to use them to control air condition the rooms that have them. Ill post something if I find a way to do that ,HomeKit,darzlf8,1,t5_3218m
9922692,0,t3_5hkn32,Try removing the word light from the names of the plugs.I know that sounds insane but I had an iHome plug named Jills Nightlight that totally refused to work until I renamed it something without nightlight in the name. ,HomeKit,db0y9rk,3,t5_3218m
10031659,0,t1_dbe9pws,Ok I think that based on what I need I should focus on another type of solution. I thought that apple tv could work as a better hub.Thanks,HomeKit,dbf5hd4,1,t5_3218m
10151506,0,t1_dbumx44,Thanks. The problem with those are that it has to be set to a time or locationetc. Im wanting to say something like Siri good night and have the lights downstairs start fading out as I walk up the stairs. I do this now using my Echo with Yonomi but Id like to do the same thing with Siri but Im not sure its possible. ,HomeKit,dbuq91z,1,t5_3218m
10203397,0,t3_5lzqeg,I avoided buying the existing products because I didnt believe what they were saying it was clearly impossible  but Im definitely in for the Homekit system when it launches.,HomeKit,dc0m1q7,3,t5_3218m
10230336,0,t1_dc3j9kl,I recommend using a Raspberry Pi or Mac running Homebridge in order to make those third party bulbs accessible via Siri.,HomeKit,dc3nzbz,3,t5_3218m
10433773,0,t3_5o35me,Are Apple TVs supposed to show up in the Home app?Mine th generation has never been there. Just wondering if I didnt set it up properly. ,HomeKit,dcqqklp,1,t5_3218m
10466185,0,t1_dcua3lr,Only problem I foresee here is depending on the length of the driveway people in his house may not connect to wifi for homebridgepeople to trigger lights.A third option might be Life...,HomeKit,dcug5vu,1,t5_3218m
10536553,0,t3_5qqgcn,I received this response from idevices Thanks for contacting the iDevices Customer Experience Team! The Wall Switch is designed to work with any standard wall plates with its standard rocker design. Once the Wall Switch becomes available for shipment this February more information on Wall Plates that can be purchased with it will become available. As of now we do not sell wall plates.,HomeKit,dd2fnss,1,t5_3218m
10634458,0,t3_5s75mp,I made a scene called Living Room Lights which includes one Hue bulb and one light plugged into a Kookgeek outlet. I can turn on the two things at once by touching the scene in the Home app but Siri cant seem to turn them both on or off. What gives?,HomeKit,ddcv37m,1,t5_3218m
10639762,0,t1_ddcv6zo,In this case I dont think its because living room lights already exists. Its because hes trying to turn off a scene. Scenes are supposed to be Do this and it doesnt seem like Siri knows how to undo it. To create a grouping of lights that you can turn onoff use service groups.,HomeKit,dddernr,2,t5_3218m

10917837,0,t1_de62sps,Sounds a lot like my setup! My Mac Mini is a  though I beefed it up with some RAM and an SSD to act as a server for a few other things. Even on the base hardware you should be fine it really doesnt take much to run HomeBridge.Just moving is the perfect time to do this makes the transition that much easier as you can just adapt to it being part of the new house. Good luck with everything!,HomeKit,de63j68,1,t5_3218m
11016261,0,t1_degn4ya,So the main issue is your Sunset based scene isnt working then? ,HomeKit,degnurr,1,t5_3218m
11098167,0,t1_demiu9h,Not too sure how to fix it but with regards to the ecobee remote sensor I dont think it is appropriate for your use case.It is not a motion dectector it will take longer to let ecobee and homekit know that someone is in the room. It wont happen right away but it should eventually not sure on how much time needs to pass for it to work.,HomeKit,depyuds,2,t5_3218m
11315259,0,t3_61hlzq,Not at a time relative to sunset but a fixed time like pm is no problem.,HomeKit,dfekekb,1,t5_3218m
11322025,0,t1_dffb0w9,No there hasnt but that doesnt mean that its not possible. They probably already have the necessary hardware but Apple needs to give the OK first after testing the product checking the Software etc... Id hold back on buying it tho until its officially supported incase it doesnt go through. ,HomeKit,dffbz3t,2,t5_3218m
11432449,0,t3_6378d1,I just bought the iSS yesterday and it has a temp sensor but I cant really attest to its functionality  I am having the damnedest time getting the motion sensor to turn on hue lights for an automation.,HomeKit,dfruu91,1,t5_3218m

11778618,0,t1_dgtzooz,I dont think HomeKit will be dead in the water because of this. As long as products keep coming down the pipeline the system will mature. With MFI and Apple being able to control things they are attempting to ensure integrity and security. That is the Apple way. It shouldnt be surprising and I think in the end it will be better for customers.,HomeKit,dgv56qm,1,t5_3218m
