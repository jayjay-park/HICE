1027293,0,t3_22sgn4,I have some news regarding Golden plates for the USA. I found out why it isnt listed on the Official USA game site. gtThe Golden Plates program works only for some European countries. You should still be able to unlock some rewards such as some artworks and screens but nothing related to the game. gtWe wouldve loved to have this event open to all unfortunately the rules are different from one country to another and on the US side we werent able to get it the same deals.Dont be surprised if it doesnt work because the promo was never put on the USA site. Who knows we may get a different promo here. At least we know for sure were getting the Muscle edition which can be pro ordered at your local Gamestop.,The_Crew,chl25ag,2,t5_2xiux

Like all of the cars in the game the DLC cars will probably excel in some areas and lack performance in other areas. IF the cars are superb though I would  agree with you but from what Ive heard considering your car is your avatar and your ability to customize your car you should be able to race at the top level with any car you tune up there. They might not all perform at the same level in certain areas but it should balance out.,The_Crew,cmk47e7,1,t5_2xiux

It would be ridiculous to expect  cars racing one another to finish within  seconds of each over in an hour long race in traffic.However I think there should be benchmark cars and rewards should be based on how you fare against those cars not the rubber band cars.,The_Crew,cmkkv02,5,t5_2xiux

The other is a R with Accel x  Speed x  Grip x . The Focus is ridiculously fast accelerating out of corners and slides just enough that you can take corners faster than any other car while still maintaining forward momentum the Skyline is similar but takes a hit in the acceleration for a gain in top end speed for this big long straights it also drifts less. ,The_Crew,cnq84wq,-1,t5_2xiux

5155659,0,t3_3lm0vr,Street really does feel superfluous once you get Perf.  In my opinion the upcoming Drift spec shouldnt exist and street should just be retooled into the drifting spec.  Street does do a lot better on dirt roads than Perf does but very few missions faction story or PVP take advantage of this and force you into mixed track types as Street so its rare that you get to see and feel that distinction between S and P.The difference between Raid and Dirt is obvious if you know what youre looking for.  Dirt can hit its maximum speed on tarmac or dirtsnowy roads and that maximum speed is faster than Raid.  Raid just doesnt slow down on any terrain type even full offroad at the cost of having a lower top speed and acceleration.  Dirts also corner far better than Raid and handle better offroad than Street Perf and Circuit.,The_Crew,cv7g6ha,6,t5_2xiux

In auto it doesnt even get to third gear! okay that isnt normal. if you would hold the accelerator all the way in you should go through all the gears. are you perhaps using a playstation controller? i believe there was a small mistake in how that reacted to the throttle. try going into your settings and put the slider for throttle linearity all the way to the right. do this even if you dont have a playstation controller just try it out.as for pvp your car is not max level and im afraid pretty much everyone in pvp uses maxed out cars.and for the skills if you do a skill of a certain level you earn a part for that level until you get platinum but you will see. so doing low level skills will result in low level parts. ,The_Crew,cycqll3,3,t5_2xiux
6060307,0,t3_3yjlfh,i quote  SuggestionWith how bikes currently perform compare to cars this can only go  ways to improve the game. We start of with the first suggestion.  Separating bikes from carsThis method can go  ways and has been suggested a few times.Allow players to vote whether bikes are allowed in a similar way whether collision or traffic is either on or off. If there is a player in the lobby that doesnt have Wild Run then the box cant be ticked in a similar way an low level player joins a lobby where he doesnt have Perf Raid or Circuit unlocked.  Have a completely separate lobby where bikes are only allowed. These suggestions sounds pretty straight forward but then it would be a bit boring dont you think? Cars vs bike action will make the game much more interesting as players take full advantage of both strength and weakness of their vehicles and battle out.

You can buy all the perk points you want some CC exclusive cars that are available in Season pass and probably to screw around a bit more.Making a Twitter account wont hurt and if you dont want twitter to be attached to your email just make a dummy gmail account.

I tried with a Fullstock Mini and didnt get it so it may just be the reward but I have had success with other rewards and Fullstock cars.For example I managed to get the Tokyo Drift reward by changing the colour of my Fullstock Z to black and drifting around with it so I guess some rewards are just that picky on how theyre earned.,The_Crew,d8p6f76,1,t5_2xiux

9537397,0,t3_5bcpgo,.mbit download doesnt sound like much but it should actually be fine for most online games.  kbit upload I can definitely see causing a lot of lag issues if one of you is hosting the session or a pvp lobby.Generally in online games when you encounter lag it is because of high ping response times or interrupted transfers. Wifi does this a lot generally a bad solution for online games.In your case though I think it is the upload speed causing problems since your ping times should be acceptable or even very good to both your cousin being very close geographically and to the crew servers in France if Im not mistaken also decently close geographically.I wish I had better advice to give than get better internets I really do but i think that kbit is pushing it a bit in some games it varies.  I have for example played ultra street fighter iv online on a g usb dongle thing with exceeded data cap I was at something ridiculous like kbit updown but it was still perfectly fine in that game.  I still had excellent ping response time the game just didnt need to send large amounts of data,The_Crew,d9oolg0,2,t5_2xiux
