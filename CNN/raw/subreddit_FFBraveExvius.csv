Me and my japanese buddies who play are under the impression it raises M.Def as well as healing potency if this is the case or not has yet to proven by science but weve all noticed a decrease in magic damage dealt to characters with a high SPR stat. Yes the Magic stat increases the damage of black magic spells.If you have anymore questions feel free to shoot em at me i work all hours of the day so might take some time but you caught me while i was browsing so you got lucky this time hehe.,FFBraveExvius,cwjd7lb,2,t5_34n2x

6861781,0,t1_d0tyhlu,Im sure you already figured it out as well but you didnt mention that the main attraction with that weapon is not the damage but the defense stat on it. Youll be hard pressed to find another weapon that has that much defense. Perfect for tanking.EDIT Theres going to be at least one brawler in each FF so the list will grow. Plus you also have other units like Firion who can use everything. It wont be THAT niche .,FFBraveExvius,d0u3ccu,0,t5_34n2x
6870313,0,t1_d0nprbj,Sorry about the late reply  I didnt get to really look into this until yesterday. I ran a few tests using fire katana chains and gaebolg weakness on brachiosaurus.Im not entirely sure how things used to work due to a lack of dual wield before the change you discuss but currentlyAny weapons effect or element fire ice dragon slayer human slayer etc is simply applied to the character meaning that you can just think of it as a passive buff. For example during my Gaebolg test  I had Gungnir in one hand and Gaebolg in the other. Using barrage every hit procd weakness effect from dragon slayer. Another example using elemental weapons is chaining two lightnings with one fire katana each. Every hit does an element chain meaning that the each of the units attacks is fire element. Thus weapon effects and element are just applied to the character not each weapon.As for the question of having a weak and strong element my guess is that the weaknessresist text shows up determined by the total sum of all your elements and slayer effects. So if you attack a holyresist human type enemy with Excalibur and Human Slayer I believe itll show up without any text and just neutral.      Ill be writing something up on the wiki in more depth about how elemental weakness and resistances are displayed after some more testing once I get Lightnings  debuff skill but hopefully these initial findings are enough to answer any questions you have.,FFBraveExvius,d0v27tg,1,t5_34n2x

7974696,0,t1_d4bx3hi,uhh... im not sure if i understand which part youre referring to but just to be sure i cover all grounds. Stealing and then overkilling gives you two chances of getting awakening mats. This list was initially meant to help GL players to understand that there are what i thought to be specific monsters that you could stealkill from to get certain awakening mats e.g. the elusive heavens ash etc.so thanks to the input of yourself and several others and i believe Nazta mentioned this in another thread somewhere else the nd continent is chock full of monsters that have awakening mats.the next step as mentioned in my edit about altema is to find out if i can extract and provide a translated list of possible awakening mats that can be farmed from the different monsters. Hopefully i can add it to the wiki so we dont have to use crappy autotranslate to find things...in the meantime i added the statement in bold to let everyone know that theyre missing out if they dont steal before overkilling.hope this helps to clear up your confusion! ,FFBraveExvius,d4cfjnu,1,t5_34n2x

Sure your level resets but you are given so many cactuars it is a breeze to get back to max level. I have only been playing FFBE for about  weeks and in that time Ive gotten six  characters to lvl. In GBF starting from when I unlocked the last limit break for Cagliostro so she can go from  to  it took me about  months to get her to lvl.

8065763,0,t3_4pokht,Ill try to answer  your questions to my best ability and may not answer everything. Your team is solid but bear in mind that a different fight may require you to bring a different char.  Theres no onesizefitsall team set up.  For example if a boss is weak to physical attack you probably will not bring a mage or vice versa.  I think your roster can support you in most aspects and you just need to pick and choose your team on harder fights.  Personally I set up my healer with Siren with Silence and Blind so my healer can help with CC while Healing.  I usually bring up a back up healer who can do damage as well.  On harder fights you may want to have Rain pair with Shiva so he can MagicPower break to mitigate damage and bring a Paralyzer with you.  Chaining crowd control effects is the name of the game in order to win..  As for farming it looks like you should do some adv EXP vortex and Awakening Vortex to get your chars up to max level.  After thats done Id start farming WolfPeak  Desert exploration for Megacrysta Ice and Fire to craft hero ring  a receipe you get from Trophies which gives  atk and mag.  .  Gear will come as you run through town chests  Keys so I wouldnt stress too much in buying with gil unless theres a chat thats under geared Id buy some NPC gear..  Silence Blade is a good craft from lock chest you can look it up from exviuswiki.com .  Focus your team leveling on RainLassFinaPremium units.

Plus youll never be able to face the fun challenging content. Or level up to prepare for the future tough stuff.And we have no idea if global will EVER get rate ups. And even if they do when. Japan took months. Global could take even longer. Plus the first rate ups could well be for a unit you dont care for. Meanwhile many which are very viable even  ahead where japan is are available right now.And vortex is absolutely critical and awesome way better then FFRK dailies because you pick what you do today. No super annoying only can xp  day a week sunday.. Namely awakening  int for sacred crystals and other mats to awaken you units and xp  adv to level them up. Its horribly boring and INSANELY time consuming to try to only do explorers for xp. Only crazy insane FF fanatical nerds would do that for a full team of  lvls all the way thru. Not to mention the most efficient way to xp once youve got a solid core team is to just run  or  units at a time along with a strong guest something that would severely slowdown your progress in the later explorers.,FFBraveExvius,d4t7jyd,1,t5_34n2x

8136252,0,t1_d4ukbkt,Enhancing duplicate characters boosts their Trust Mastery TM by a base of  on top of whatever Trust  they already have. Ex   Vaan . TM and a Vaan . TM would give some exp based on level of added Vaan and a total of . Trust on the Enhanced Vaan. Using any character that isnt the same as the character youre enhancing just gives experience based on level of the unit being added.Theres a few of the standard summons that have some pretty decent TMs. If you dont need gil or elemental crysts I would set your daily friend gift to Friend Points FP so you can accumulate FP and use them to do standard FP summons. Over time youll rack up quite a few units some of them are actually pretty decent and youll eventually get enough to master a few TMs. If you dont have a full set of premium summons at this point in the game majority of the standard FP summons will suffice just as good for the current content.Materials are used for multiple things. Crafting weaponsarmor spells potions and status effect curing items but just as important Awakening max level units that can be awakened. If you go to the Awaken Units page the ones that arent darked out can be upgraded to the next star tier. Even if they arent max level you can tap on them to see what materials you need to awaken them when you do get to max level so you can plan ahead.I know this isnt super indepth but hopefully it helped somewhat. The wiki sidebar on the right side of the subreddit should be able to provide more info if you have anymore inquiries. I still use a lot of that myself. This is the FFBE wiki page thats still being added to but theres plenty of information for new players that it should help you with whatever you need.

8139236,0,t3_4qihun,Hi id like to get your opinion on the pulls i got so far ive got both of them locked on a facebook account but i dont know which to keep playing on coz time starved. anyways on one account i got a  Cecil and a Exdeath as the best pulls. on the other account ive got Tera Kuja  Bartz CoD. would appreciate your input. thanks!,FFBraveExvius,d4uy7ou,1,t5_34n2x

Your argument is based on nonsense.  Not to mention that TMR are actually AVAILABLE for FP players theyre not locked behind a paywall. Sure you can fuse  dupes into your character and get it immediately. Or you could be patient and farm it yourself slowly get Trust Moogles for free and obtain them.  gt The amount of times people got absolute shit in their  free rerolls is much much higher than a  in FFRK  I do not care which game has better rates as it is all chancebased anyway. But the reason people reroll so bloody often is because they want a really specific team composition. Theres pretty much ALWAYS something useful in those  rolls the same way an pull in FFRK always has something useful.

Keep in mind that enemies get built up resistances towards status effects gets harder and harder to reapply the same status aliment.

Rain tells Lasswell to consume the flower because hes sick and exhausted the most. Lasswell recovers thanks and apologizes to Fina.

8514876,0,t3_4wc8ot,Its the simple nature of power creep newer units need to be better so that people will always want to pull for them and thus spend  which means that obviously the older the character gets the more devalued she becomes. That doesnt mean that Lightning is by any means a bad unit shell still be extremely powerful its just that shes no longer the overall strongest character in the game hasnt been for a while. And guess what those new characters that are now at the top and that you might be considering going after instead of Lightning their days at the top are numbered as well because I guarantee you that by the time they reach GL well have heard of other insanely more powerful characters released in JP.Another  things to consider is that rankings are a very subjective business and will vary quite a bit and  base units are extremely hard to pull and I wouldnt chase a specific one unless they come in a very nice banner because realistically those other accompanying characters are what youre going to get unless youre a very large whale and then youd still need some RNG luck.,FFBraveExvius,d65x2c8,2,t5_34n2x

8553527,0,t3_4wxukp,Its a sort of pseudo PvP where the AI controls the opposing team. Each round both teams get to act once and each round first attack is determined by chance.I dont have the most extensive experience with Arena since I just started fighting there recently. Damage is capped at  per attack so double cast AoE spells seem pretty useful. AoE MP drain is very strong since unlike PvE the characters actually need their MP to use spells. So AoE draining the entire opposing team will render their healers and mages pretty much useless. And AoE debuffs are also great obviously.Theres also changing rules every week certain kinds of abilities being banned and characters from specific games of the franchise getting buffed.By grinding Arena you collect points which determine your standing. Based on you rank you receive rewards at the end of the period. You also get small prizes now and then after battles plus medals which you can spend on an Esperlike grid for items. Arena tickets are used in a special summoning gate to summon more stuff to buff your characters like pots that increase specific stats.Its definitely more interesting than the colosseum so Im really looking forward to Arena in GL.,FFBraveExvius,d6arjm7,12,t5_34n2x

Id put more hope in the base  characters that started off with a  form like Lena Tina Roselia etc... but many of those still havent gotten a  upgrade.Refia  with dualcast Trust Mastery is still the best dedicated healer because of Arise and because shes immune to a lot of status effectsits really a nuisance when Rem gets confused or falls asleep. The upside for Rem is her versatility and giant mana pool that regenerates. I was dualcasting Curaga all day and it didnt seem like her MP was ever decreasing whereas you eventually start getting into MP trouble dualcasting Curaga with Refia. Because of her strong base magik she can also fill in on damage when needed whereas Refia is more one dimensional.Who knows Tilith might make both obsolete but I have a feeling Tiliths downside will be her being more prone to going dry on MP.,FFBraveExvius,d6b8pdg,2,t5_34n2x

The bundles in particular were very predatory as they took advantage of players new to the game.  The rod on the other hand just wasnt worth the effort but I dont really mind since it was something only offered to the global community and if you didnt want it you could skip it with no real loss.BTW expect most of the Global Only events to be mediocre at best apparently thats Gumis M.O.,FFBraveExvius,d6dwiq7,3,t5_34n2x

8582890,0,t1_d6edku6,Well working in support I imagine that youre aware of the fact that one of the things support teams use to prioritize tickets is the number of tickets opened for an issue and one user spamming the ticketing system throws off the metrics for that. Yes some people are having this issue others are not. Mine works exactly as intended and so I imagine do many others. There are people who are having issues with an item sync bug that has made it completely impossible to continue playing the game as well. If youre spamming the ticket queue with your relatively minor complaint you can force people who are working on other issues to deal with your complaints instead through automatic thresholds for ticket queue depth etc. If they determine youre abusing the system I wouldnt really fault them for banning you especially if youre paying nothing and costing them money and time.,FFBraveExvius,d6eg3qi,2,t5_34n2x

8595822,0,t1_d6fxp4r,We debate  things. I still stand FFRK gacha trap is better. The chance to get usable relic in FFRK is bigger than the chance to get usable characters in FFBE. After you have your main A team in FFBE only better characters or characters that broad your gameplay or TM characters can be considered usable. And the chance to get main feature relics is still higher than the chance to get main featured characters. Personally I consider chasing  base character is FFBE is equal to chase for a single relic in FFRK which both is never suggested.The reason why I said Lightning is slowly being forgotten in FFBE is you only have  slots in here and admit in Japanese account trading no one looking for Lightning anymore see lots of Tidus Eileen Gilgamesh. I admit it may create a mistake that Lightning is useless she still has use AoE elemental as you saidIn next example Friends unit can be any rule so we dont consider it. You will want at least  White Mage so there is  slot left which Lightning need to compete and right now there is  better characters on that position Tidus Orlandu Gilgamesh and Eileen. On the other hand FFRK has  weapon slots  armor slots times there is  Realms so there is  slot if you dont differ magic and physical relic it is  as I dont differ Mage and Physical Damage Dealer in FFBE so it is  slot.In other example we just draw Roselia as best white mage comparable to Fina but just in few banners Lenna beat her as white mage pick and next banner will have Garnet who beat Lenna and next Refia will beat Garnet. Refia will stay for a longer time but there is Rem and after that Tilith? upgraded. They compete for that  slot in your team. There is little place for Roselia if you have Lenna in example and what happen if you happen to have Rem. On the other hand SG is still number  relic in Japanese FFRK it is a SB a  that even better when being compared to OSB  if you called it  and lots of BSSB are better than OSB. Can you imagine Lightning  base compared to CloudSephiroth perhaps FFBE future ? While Lightning is great for Gilgamesh Trial but how about future trial. I still believe SG will still be that strong for future boss.The problem is because there is this much slot for FFBE characters  it is come from the game design so the powercreep is hit the player harder every currency you invest in characters will be less shiny faster.Second is about orb.You dont need her weapon to use her in top fight in example. You can use  star ability which come from honing. Her combo is ProtectgaShellga easy  star ability and Saint Cross R  ability which is required lots of time perhaps comparable to farming for TM I admit but long time players will have enough for it so do TM. If you have those two she can go with any realm synergy and she can deal damage comparable to her  relic.I agree with age of games but FFRK has been friendly since  Mythril per Day I think it is few bannersmonths going in before it was worst. Its orbs also have been fine after Heroic mode which open  for mass people and current  and  daily open  orbs. But the problem only Trust Pot is the alternative to orbs in FFBE and by game design it will never be as easily available as orbs in FFRK. There is this much grind you can do in FFBE for increasing power so orbs is actually better implementation if you can stand TM orbs is fine.Joining FFRK now will be the same as people who will be joining during Lightning event or even Tidus event. They can roll for better characters their Lapis from island completion can be used on better characters but their TM wont be as complete as us first month players. The same in FFRK the story Mythril can be used on better relic and it is easier to get  later on but their orbsability wont be as great as long time players people expect  months for new player to be able to defeat  of contents. Right now is not the right time actually because guaranteed  is the biggest powercreep. The same on FFBE the best time will be when daily half price pull given.I am not bashing either FFBE or FFRK too. I play both of them but even from Japanese players no one praise FFBE gacha there is even horror story to prepare  to have a chance for Lightning on the other hand FFRK player like their gacha there is a thread few days ago praising FFRK gacha.,FFBraveExvius,d6g2i0w,1,t5_34n2x

However if you look at the current released staffs in JP its still easily in the top  and the only reason I put it as  is due to Dream Watcher having a  MP passive on it as well as the fact that Im unsure of how much the  extra SPR would affect healingres. In addition to that running double healers wouldnt be a terrible idea if your team takes a while to clear a fight. Cheer is a significant mana sink mp cost and sometimes you have to choose between putting Cheer back up or healing your party so with two Lennas that will never be an issue. ,FFBraveExvius,d6idttv,2,t5_34n2x

I went into a streak. And I got  Lanis and generally nothing good. Lani is the new most useless character  even her TM is the lowest tier equip axe. Drawing her instead of anything else is like drawing a Shadow Penelo etc. Vivi is far from what most people want. Polluting featured banner with  useless characters  if I remember?

Yes it might dissuade some from pulling for a major boost that is actually  but it would give us nothing to bitch about in that regard when we dont get the unit were chasing. It would also play out better for Gumi I believe in the long run. I dropped  on day one to get WoL and he never popped. Im still a little salty about it but if I knew how low my odds were thered be no salt ALONG with me being willing to give Gumis next app a shot if it interested me.

8784135,0,t1_d73oll3,Of course I think more will get upgraded eventually.  But not for a very very long time as you said.  They are clearly starting with a pattern of one protagonist and one antagonist.  And for FFVI we already know the first upgrades are Terra and Kefka.  We are currently in the context of discussing how useful these characters are for the sake of pulling on THIS banner.  So if you want to pull for Celes right now because youre convinced shell get six stars in  years be my guest but I cant understand why people expect that to be taken into consideration in this banner review.  The protagonistantagonist expectation is to determine who is not currently certain to be future proof in Japan but can be expected to be in a slightly more reasonable time frame and so far the theory is working perfectly.,FFBraveExvius,d73otvi,1,t5_34n2x

Youll still get the same yield by doing the  hour or even  hour one.

If I want a physical team I roll with ChizuruCoDArtemios x barrage Vaan Full Break Fina Cheer which wrecks pretty much any single target boss. If I want a mage team I roll with Vaan Focus ExdeathKefka   filler since I currently dont have lenna or tellah or any other magey types. But the elemental chain from Exdeath and Kefka is enough to wipe out any group.Kefka is extremely useful when decked out with  MAG   hero rings Fire Staff MAG  better than pestle for him and easy to get though Dwarves Forge exploration Mages Hat  Black Robe and RamuhShiva. His MAG can go over  at this point which clears any trash units with blizzarathundarafira using weakness. Hes a solid investment and you wont regret spending time maxing him.You already have Artemios at  and Barrage is an amazing ability that gets even more mileage after a Full Break from Vaan.

8901162,0,t3_523w2y,Honestly after  DWs its more of a luxury because of the future line ups for Trial bosses. Right now you would go with mostly physical damage dealers or mages and just blow things up which doesnt work too well in later trials. Its more about endurance one of the reasons for a tank in the future. So your lineup should look likeTank Physical Damage DealerMageSupportHealerSo ideally you would want dual wield on Mage Physical Damage Dealer and possibly Support. Healer you would want as much mana as possible and if they dont have a native dual cast you would want to add that into it anyways which already takes up a slot. Then there is healers like Tilith who cant use weapons. As well youll be healing pretty much every turn so taking longer to burn through mana Tank obviously you would want as much health and use a shield whenever possible. You may be able to get away with Dual wield on units like Amarant but ideally you would want them to take as much punishment as possible. So that leaves about  of them with Support possibly not even needing the Dual Wield as they would be mostly spending the  turn rotations buffing whatever they need to. As far as weapons go I usually say to farm up as much of them as possible. You never know what units youll pull so having a wide range of them to be able to dual wield is always a plus. For things like Barrage other then just one of them I think its pretty much a waste to try and farm up multiples as many units get better multiplier attacks then Barrage at  stars with the notable exception of Firion. ,FFBraveExvius,d7hsiqh,1,t5_34n2x

So you only need to get them both to a combined total of . The other  comes from fusion bonus. So if you had two Zidane at . then you would only need to get them both to . which is  total.

8979251,0,t1_d7r1yuu,Its not that complicated to be honest.  You want to stack as much ATK or MAG on ONE character as you possibly can dont distribute your gear go all in on one character and give the rest to the others.  Whoever can get the highest ATK or MAG gets the gear.  You may need to play around with different builds as some characters can equip certain weapons and armor that others cant while others get ATK bonuses as well.  For instance I had all my gear on my CoD until I maxed out my Fencer.CoD has barrage which is a great ability but Fencer gets ATK  when shes wielding a sword and Intangir drops a  ATK sword! so my CoD at max ATK is  but my Fencer gets all the way up to !  The  extra attack more than makes up for the fact that Fencer doesnt have Barrage so all the attack goes to her and CoD is left to pick up the pieces which drops her to .Beyond that its pretty basic its not like certain gear needs to go on certain characters just stack one character or two if you have both MAG and ATK characters.  This is why people often dont like copies of characters because so many weapons and equipment are unique it makes it hard to gear more than one  for instance you only get one Murasame so if youve equipped that on one Chizuru another one will be far behind however Chizuru and CoD can coexist quite well because one equips macesthrowing while the other equips katanasdaggers.,FFBraveExvius,d7r63lg,2,t5_34n2x

8990661,0,t1_d7rnn38,Im running a very similar comp although I do have everyone maxed out. You absolutely fuckin must max Lenna. Curaja you will need to use after the magnitude  and Destroy abilities. I use Garland Artemios Exdeath Tellah Lenna and always bring a Kefka friend. Escape is wonderful to avoid all the battles. And hyperdrive hits the bosses hardest by far. They are all resistant to magic but dont be deceived its still pretty good. You want raging fist on Garland and start the fights by cheering. Fencer and Cod are better damage dealers than Artemios who suffers from not being able to equip a good weapon right now. I wouldnt recommend an all magic team simply because the first boss depletes MP very fast.  When cheer wears off remember Golems ability reduces damage taken and is moderately useful. Last remember to use a tent before the third boss. Edit Id run Lenna Exdeath Kefka Fencer Tellah and you can bring a WOL friend who can tank shit for you. If your Fencer doesnt have  atk then use Garland. Alternative team comp would be Amarant Lenna Fencer Exdeath Kefka and bring a Vaan or a Chizuru friend who can really fuck shit up. ,FFBraveExvius,d7sjezz,2,t5_34n2x

All banner since ff  if you count them as  were  week banner. ff  and face book are filler and gd came earlier. There are not many banner they can do earlier like gd which made sense to release earlier so that leaves bf another filler or even global exclusive units. I also believe that they want to get out the game title events soon. I would say bf for  week is a good next option. They could do ligthning next so they can follow up with the tactics event.

And even in a longer fight Cheer comes out on top for a pure physical team. Two Cheers lasts  turns. Most physical DPS units can only Barrage lt times  MP.  turns of  ATK is better than  turns of unbuffed Barrage assuming your other  DPS are about even.

9095507,0,t3_54ujsy,I tried my ATeam and got really close three times in a row.  Kefka Chizuru Leo Vaan and Lenna.  I got frustrated and swapped to a Blizzaga chain team and failed.  I switched to a BarrageCheer team and failed.  Went back to my ATeam and finally got a round where he didnt Snort in the third round.  After that it was easy.  He snorted Lenna late but I finished him before it mattered.  Long story short use your best team.  The meta strategies work fantastic if you have a lot of TMRs but are more difficult to pull off with less gear and less TMRs.  If you lose someone thats not expendable to an early Snort just restart.

9099943,0,t1_d85mi6c,Appreciate the discussion.  I am not arguing that the Lenna  VannCeles shell isnt a great buff. But overall Im not a huge fan of the lines of play for this shell and I used it for a long time. It normally opens up something like this...  Lenna Cheer gt Vaan Focus gt WoL Full Break lt Mage HyperdriveMeteorUltima gt Attacker BarrageIts a fine opener and sets up all the buffs you need right away. My problem is the impact of those units afterwards. I like Dualcast on my Healer and if Im using Cheer with Lenna Im unable to sustain that as well as I would if I had a dedicated support unit. The situation you describe about having to choose a buff isnt high impact enough to win over long term MP sustainability. Brach doesnt Ultima turn one. Vaan is a mediocre attacker as well afterwards.  For now Im convinced that Id rather replace Lenna with Garnet and Vaan for Gilbert. So my optimal team with Gilbert is...  Lightning Kefka WoL Gilbert Garnet.  And my turns look something like...  Garnet Dualcast gt Faith Kefka gt Imperil Boss gt Gilbert Cheer gt WoL Full Break gt Lightning Crushing Blow gt Kefka Thundaga Chain  Then the following turns all of my units are still strong. Garnet can Dualcast healing for a long time Gilbert can be his tanky Chanting self WoL can Barrage Provoke  Brave Presence when he gets  star and Lighting  Kefka can pour on the DPS. The survivability of having already tanky units plus turn one Full Break on a boss gives me the confidence to be able to delay my defensive buffs for a single turn. Im in the boss battle for the long term Im not trying to set up all my buffs in one turn and kill him with an alpha strike. This strategy just works a lot better for that in my experience.  Anyway its cool youve started to evaluate him. I think he deserves to be higher but I wont argue where you have him since my heart isnt in this debate or anything and I dont actually use his limit break as anything more than a finisher after his main role comes to a close.,FFBraveExvius,d85nzps,1,t5_34n2x

I have my core group for harder content maxed and no new characters id like to level lightning etc..If anyone else is in this position would you farm for cactuars to level say additional Kefkas or someone continue to rank farm or back to TM farm?

Unless the enemies defense is so high that the  defense makes up for the gap Luneths AoE would be far better from hitting for more than twice Chizs AoE.

But the revenue potential of each is miles apart.In product development you evaluate an effortvalue or revenue score and determine what to work on next.  If creating each unit costs the same amount of effort but one will yield significantly more value then you pursue the latter as a means of using your resources artists developers etc. in an optimal way.,FFBraveExvius,d8m0786,2,t5_34n2x

You will get less LB crystals without the th party member but you will also have one less hero for the crystals to randomly get assigned to.  You should give it a shot as it can significantly speed up the LB process while TMR farming.

This group is what youre looking at for nowRamzaExdeathKrileRydiaFreya is a solid comp to go with for a while. ExdeathKrileRydia can chain Thunder spells. Ramza can healbuffdebuffDPS if needed and Freya can DPS in the mean time. All of these have stars RamzaEx have stars and Krile has access to DualCast with Curaja upon receiving her star. Your main issue is that you lack an immediate Full Break unit which becomes progressively more important about as important as a dedicated Tank.

9306450,0,t1_d8vdjmt,I went Leo CoD Vaan Tellah Lenna and a friend Lightning. Probably isnt even worth trying without a  Lightning using a nonfire weapon. Vaan was designated support. Bar spells and focus and emergency healing or ether provider. CoD for man eater barrage. Tellah for blizzaga and raise first boss. Lightning ice blitz the fire and water dude. Crushing blow the wind lady and golbez. Leo had mirage vest and just miraged and provoked all fight. Dont be afraid to use turbo ethers as needed. I also needed a couple Phoenix downs on golbez. Shellga from charlotte is great. Otherwise youll need focus for the spr boost. Boss  raiseBoss  barfira and shellga asap. Tank provokes.  I used mirage too but I had Leo not charlotte. Lightning and Tellah go ham with ice while cod barrages. Dispel buff. Boss  Shellga no need to bar. Otherwise same strategy. Dispel buff. Cast an elemental spell if you cant kill him that turn. Boss  baraerora and shellga. Gold needles as needed. Switch to crushing blow. Golbez shellga first. Then barfira and barthundara as you can. Same strategy as before. Tank provokes. Cos barrage. Lightning crushing blow. Tellah ga spells. Cure paralysis with unicorn horns. Raise and Phoenix downs when he casts his death spell. Each boss should take around  turns.  Golbez took me more like . If you know you will kill a boss that turn dont be afraid to use ethers for whoever needs it during the boss stretch. And tent before Golbez. I would suggest leveling charlotte and replace chiz. Charlotte will be your tank and spr buffer. Someone needs to use green magic for bar spells. Celes might be squishy but if thats your best green caster then so be it. Then damage comes from lightning tellah and cod. Mostly lightning. ,FFBraveExvius,d8vnre4,1,t5_34n2x

9337200,0,t3_58cpkq,atm we are at a strange spot where we dont know when and if our star units will get a star upgrade.So i guess a safe bet would be to get equips quartz and tickets first.Then focus on mats till you get all star chars up to  star if you have any like a lot of people now got Cecil for example.Maybe grind mats for  extra if you are expecting some of your units to get star in the next month CoD maybe? speculation or you are willing to pull a bit harder for a unit people speculating a possible Tilith within a month dont take this as a trustworthy information. However you look at it fp will always have a tight management for NRG until you get an uber team setup both physical and magic and then something new will come out Best hint i can give you is try to leech of the whales their strong units to carry your units that arent maxed while doing farming events that give lots of exp. Farming for cactuars moogle king events that give exp while getting exp from the events is also a faster way for leveling units up and you need to do them less timesless energy that way.Worst case when you get to higher ranks refills become more optimal for TMR farming getting  energy on rank  is much more optimal then getting  energy at rank  for the same amount of lapis.At high ranks  with  energy per  lapis even most hc fp people will think about throwing some cash for energy refills for TM farm only. ,FFBraveExvius,d8zk48c,1,t5_34n2x

Theres also a random multiplier being applied to final damage according to the weapon used  for Katana and  for Spears.

His fullbreak is one of the most sought after skills out there. The team I mentioned is pretty decent for most content but you might have a problem with healing and tanking since WW Fina doesnt have Curaja and WoL has a pretty low chance of guarding someone unless you have Provoke on Golem. Krile can help with her Cura and smidgen of Magic DPS but should be your no  priority to replace. You can run Rydia in her place if you feel that you dont need as much healing.Shantotto is decent as Magic DPS thanks to good coverage but her stats are lacking Rydia will deal more for now. Her  is months and months away JP just got it recently.Rain for now isnt good but his  is pretty darn good. As for Maria.... just no.For now focus on levelling Lightning and WoL theyll make most of the content super easy. Try to do the Halloween event if you can just run up to wherever you can you should be able to do the Pumpkin Rider INT with a decent ally. The Corn you get should go to Cactuars and Awakening mats for lightning. ,FFBraveExvius,d95huuf,2,t5_34n2x

Use ara spells instead of aga spells to conserve MP for those that dont have enough. Use LBs when available to conserve more MP. If you get the Madehva boss you can raise it for a one hit kill.  On tougher waves dont be afraid to cast faith on KefkaExDeath. This is the worst case scenario as Kefka doesnt have fire spells the mobs are weak to fire.

9396461,0,t3_59b0oo,ppl think of suport in a wrong way. not always a unit alone is the groups suporter. atm in a normal party cheer and a break are the common suport skills used but it doesnt mean ur taking a suport unit.in the suport role in global atm only Cerius is a pure suport provide only suport stuff being very useless in any other role he wont deal dmg or heal he only provides suport habilitys and hes very good at that but when u dont need the baragas he provide then he is useless as hell!then there are half suports like wol vaan lenna... etc. who provide breaksbuffs while doing other stuff like tanking dmg or heal. this is the meta suports we use because the content doesnt require a specific suport in a certain specific thing most of it at least cerius rly good in tower of babel P  down the line more pure suports will be available but atm dont think about using ramza to sing ramza song is only good AFTER the upgrade. so until then hes a dmg dealer with some suport skills for your party.,FFBraveExvius,d972fou,0,t5_34n2x

But more importantly his Heros Rhyme gives  turns that increases ATKDEFMAGSPR by  while healing their HP and MP every turn. The healing amount isnt any less than Curaja. Theoretically after he does the  breaks and does the singing... now you have  or  other attackers that get their base ATK essentially DOUBLED. Thats almost like bringing a bigger party to the battle and no worries of dying or running out of mp during those  turns due to the the hpmp heal from the singing.Exdeath is still great due to him being able to Dualcast Meteor but thats all the power he brings to the table. Due to his mp and lack of certain mag increasing equips... he does less damage than some other mages that can dualcast meteor or others.Cecil is still great its just that his enhancements arent game changers so he gets outshone by others. ,FFBraveExvius,d99iqqu,6,t5_34n2x

For boss fight generally you are better off to equip elemental weapon since crushing blow does more damage and chain much higher but even then it is not going to be always the case.

Before Lightning rerolling for Exdeath was the best you could do.Once he gets his  he will be the best mage available on GL no question. Just like Lightning was miles ahead of any  ATK there wont be any Mage even close to him.In JP for Altema they moved him for  reasons    the Meta doesnt favor Mage character. They dont chain well and cant match  OrlandoEileenTidus.  They consider best in slot TM for rating so Exdeath having Dual Cast AND Meteor doesnt do much and the inability to wear top tier TM like Majin Fina  MAG with RodRobe hurts him.  They consider Enhancements and characters like Majin Fina got a lot better. Keep in mind DKC and Ramza were almost the lowest  and are now  respectively.Exdeath is still the best  base Mage even in JP and youll have to get  base Mage to start getting something better.,FFBraveExvius,d9dt1k0,3,t5_34n2x

9475246,0,t1_d9gxer1,. If you have Gungnir or other good TMs I would try Kain. If not just keep you BCL for some months since Garland will become better than her when he gets . Also Agrias is a BreakerSupport not a good damage dealer.. The Auras from this event are really great for buffing BCL ATK but keep in my that next month well get the nd part of Ordelion and the recipe for ATK  so you should consider if the x is worth all the grind.. Regarding to your last question Bartz and Exdeath will become  in the next months so you should really consider levelling them. Exdeath learns Dualcast and some killer passives that make him better than Kefka so you should swap them in the near future. About your DPS I would only keep CoD in this job if you have Rising Sun equipped on her otherwise I would replace her with  Garland.. You have really good future proof chars Garland  as DPS Agrias  as BreakerSupport Cecil  as Tank Exdeath  as MAGger and you probably have any good White MageHealer.

9490642,0,t1_d9ivtlg,Im beginning to understand a little better. By my understanding on what you propose I see problems with only asking how many  pulls they did. The first problem if we were to do this is I would have to already know what the rates were based on rarity for  pulls. Otherwise how would I know how many  pulls to remove and how many ? The point of this separation is twofold to know the rates for  and normal summoning. I have neither and if I were to apply this method I require one of them.The second is I have already stated and it is already well known that  summons are more favorable than normal summons. Im not sure why you would assume that the distribution is equivalent between normal and  because that would be against the entire point of checking for it. What is this other question that you would ask now knowing that there is not equal rarity distribution between  and  for  and normal summons? If you have to keep adding more questions to control from this well eventually end up to what Im already doing.,FFBraveExvius,d9ixakn,1,t5_34n2x

9492558,0,t3_5athbv,Kefka is currently the strongest mage in the game right now due to his reasonably diverse kit and high single target damage spell Hyperdrive.You are probably seeing more Vivi thank Kefka because people around your level are playing without regards to their characters future strengths and are just using who they likehave at he moment.If you want Ill add you and make Kefka my leader and you can use him and see how strong he becomes. Id actually advise you to use him on Earth Shrine  Exit and use Hyperdrive on the Belmodar that is the dungeons boss.

Should I sell them or fuse them in to units I want to keep? I dont have many units right now and Im focused on completing the story for the free lapis. Should I keep my squad below level cap so they get the end of battle exp? What is the best way to level characters I want to keep? It seems to be cactuars but they also seem hard to come by. Is kain as worthless as he seems? I leveled him based on the wiki ratings as my best breaker but his best move doesnt chain and he loses a turn because of it? Im about to awaken to  star but wondering if I should waste the mats. My mage is a level  vivi. Lets say I pull Kefka tomorrow. Can I fuse vivi in to Kefka and get bonus exp from him being ? Or is there no point to that? Im trying to stay as close to ftpctp as possible so Im not going full collector mode on this game. Where can I farm magicite? Seems getting my espers to  should be a priority. Is exploration best? What about that  lapis deal? Seems like a waste but not sure. Thanks for the help i know these are a ton of questions.

9519398,0,t1_d9mgf17,Well! These exploration runs are pretty cheap NRG wise I think.  So if you fail you are only missing about an hours worth of NRG.I have a pretty okay team Ive not pulled any Star Bases... and I only leveled up Garnet as a healer  so I do not even have Cheer p  And I have not yet awakened any units to stars.I had a friend with a Lv. Cloud of Darkness already equipped with two Rising Suns and Dragon Killer and some other assorted items.  And it practically carried me through ELT single handedly.If you have any Lv. CoD friends I think theyll be your best bet for a carry.I Librad and killed most enemies the first time I encountered them but then used Kefkas Escape to flee all battles except the Dragons.With my team Cecil Stars Chizuru x Excalibur... Light is resisted by all the dragons was little use! Celes I thought Sealing Blade would catch Xandes Meteor... Didnt.  Focus is good though Kefka Escape and Hyperdrive and Garnet heals and Raise I was able to turn the Yellow and Green dragons but not red for some reason.My team didnt contribute nearly as much damage as the friend CoD did and it only had like  ATK  was not pushing  like some of my Lightning friends have.But since this event is going to be around for two weeks you may want to take the time to finish maxing out your units if you have a hard time.Find a unit with Escape Kefka Locke Zidane or Thief  Or FP Unit TMR Paul to get you through the trash and run straight to the boss unlike in the FF event theres only one boss!.Kill dragons along the way if you are able and use a tent before fighting Xande.,FFBraveExvius,d9mgvnc,2,t5_34n2x

9552012,0,t1_d9qen4i,Disclaimer Im still a noob at JP and most of this comes from videos and things ive read in the past Depends on a lot of things. WoL and Refia both have Embolden making it a bit of a waste to have it twice. It seems like a lot of people do run WoL and Cecil for some content with Tilith as their main healer but I imagine Refia will do just fine. For most content you probably wont need  tanks and especially if youre running mages the aoe defspr breaks can really come in handy though the lack of Focus kinda sucks. Probably WoL Refia for most content with all  for the hard stuff. ,FFBraveExvius,d9qhe3i,2,t5_34n2x

If you dont want to reroll. If you are doing Chamber of Experience Adv it is  NRG for only exp or if you do the Stage  BF event with atleast one bonus unit you can you will get enough Karma to buy one Metal Gigantaur which you can fuse to a unit for exp. I personally cannot farm Stage  so I been doing Stage  with  BF units  of mine and  from companion and get roughly  Karma a run but you could get lucky and get a Metal God for a couple of thousand of Karma. ,FFBraveExvius,d9ybddf,2,t5_34n2x

Do you have anyone who has a strong Cover or Provoke presence to draw attacks away from Xande? Cecil Charlotte and Warrior of Light are good examples of Cover tanks they all have a move that gives them a chance of standing in front of an ally and taking reduced damage from the blow. Amarant is an example of a Draw tank he has a  chance of being targetted by an attack which becomes practically  when you combine it with Golems Provoke ability.

For subscriptionbuy to play at least I know there is only one fee for everyone and as long as that is due I will be able to enjoy the game to its fullest.

9680422,0,t1_da6aibp,In the playthrough that I screenshotted I used Diablos.In my experience by not having enough people on your team to deal damage you wont earn enough LB or Esper crystals. The longer you play the more likely you are to be punished by the RNG. But my team had a slight handicap by not using Cecil.

I think the biggest issue with taking a friend Cecil is that it become on you to have enough DPS capabilities to do maybe k per turn at minimum.Normally Id say replace the Edgar with maybe another healer or tank to ease off some of the pressure but looks like most of yours are still . Rosa is nice but having  of your team on  units would concern me unless you have a lot of gear to make them survivable. The HP buffer provided by s really helps.I feel really bad championing Cecil so hard but I think hes one of the biggest impacts to the fight possible.

9700415,0,t1_da8qpy5,Id imagine that your units unbuffed SPR might be an issue. I know Chizuru has terrible SPR so shes likely the one taking the most damage on Rune but even otherwise normally tanky units have pretty poor SPR.If you cant get HP abilities and have a silver key or two maybe consider getting SPR  if you have the cryst to craft it on hand  wind cryst per one. Muscle belt as well if you have Earth Megacrysts  per one. And sub out Chizuru for some unit who has other utilityhigher SPR. Even then itll be close.A better friend would help too. By forcing Maxwell into lower health you trigger her scripted attacks which will prioritize them over RuneSacred Song. Youd need a unit which can get your bar up quickly and do damage though which is pretty limited to Elza I believe.,FFBraveExvius,da8s7br,1,t5_34n2x

Cloud of Darkness is pretty good too but I would say pull on the Brave Frontier one for Elza and Tilith because they have a higher value later on compared to DKC and CoD in my opinion.

9715116,0,t1_daaf8h0,Oh my... how can someone have such a thick skull?Im not saying that it is not gambling. There is something called RISK X REWARDS. The whole point of this topic is very simple the risk doesnt match the rewards for those not investing tons of money. Just read the thread title This game is good for whales and fp folks its kinda terrible for anyone in between though.This is where I am and a lot of other people are. Im not free to play but Im far from whale. I could simply not spend a penny and have close to everything I have right now..RNG is RNG but many games gives incentive for people to take the risks the bonus rare item on big pulls. its still a gamble you can still get the worse rare item but you are sure to get something rare not the worse common! The problem is that on FFBE the rates are FAVORED to result in bad prizes. On JP they solved this issue by normalizing the drop rates characters from the same star level have the same chance higher level crystal dont drop lower level characters this still a gamble this still rng but this is not annoying as pulling half shaldowsbedilessabins on gold crystals.Not only the prices are high but the rates are bad. This makes things bad for those not investing tons of money. Something so simple is so hard for you to understand?.BTW. my pulls are actually nice. Except by the  bases Ive pulled several excelent characters. The only notable  base im missing is Cecil and the only notable base  is WoL. Except by those I have all  and  bases I wanted to have. Refia Tilith CoD Agrias  Firion Exdeath Chizuru Arc. Because of that I dont feel willing to spend more money because I can get nice characters without spending money and the ones I want that would require money arent reachable because of how the rates are. There is a huge gap between FP and Whale there is not much difference from being cp or completely fp. except that you has less money being cp,FFBraveExvius,daalk4x,1,t5_34n2x

I only levelled my golem to  today so didnt have provoke at the time and instead just prayed to RNGesus. I beat maxwell twice once for diabolos and the LB finish didnt count since I used it before the finishing blow rather than after and again this time with LB finish. Both times Refia died to Meteor. Poor poor Refia.The multiple healers in my case Lenna and Cecil were integral to finishing it. I just phoenix down and carried on with double curaja topping refia off.

9717674,0,t1_daauoxj,I think you have too much tankheal and you lack DPS. Unless the CoD you are using has like  ATK with Dual Wield you are going to have a hard time even completing the Trial.    Anyway have Golem on your Cecil and try to keep provokecheerfocus up all the time on your team. Full Break is must against Maxwell and whenever she uses Sacred song which boost her ATK you need to dispel and recast FB.     Provoke on Cecil will dimish the damage your other squishes take.   Cheer will make you dish more damage and rise a little bit your survivability   Focus helps with both Genesis and Endless magic damage.    There are several threads with tricks and tips RN on our subreddit but I think that you need a strong DPS unit to carry you.  Look for one in the friend code megathread     GL D,FFBraveExvius,daawx58,1,t5_34n2x
9717814,0,t3_5eahqk,Its more or less the norm for games like these to be honest. New content keeps people interested and keeps people spending. Its one of the reasons I stopped playing FFRK content overload. As a tryhard guppy I was burning out.  At least I started playing Exvius at launch so I can keep up for now  but if events like the infamous mogcake farming becomes the norm Ill have to stop eventually. Right now Im coping by just not playing optimally  every now and then Ill burn my NRG on Chamber of Experience or Awakening so that I can be done with it quickly and the NRG isnt completely wasted. ,FFBraveExvius,daaxji5,1,t5_34n2x

9788705,0,t3_5fc6a0,The actually discussion surrounding TMRs and rankings is misleading.  This isnt about all TMRs really this is basically about a very small handful of TMRs that are essentially gamebreaking.  This is about Dual Wield Dual Cast and then DH just for parity with DW.Generally speaking it seems like its easy enough to just provide noTMR ratings current and then provide either a a note or b a second rating column for DWDCDH rating.The reality is that most TMRs are simply incremental power improvements and affect most units roughly similarly.  Sure Exdeath gets a little more juice out of LaA stacking and most mages would use MAG.  Great.  Maybe a note in the comments.  But either approach does not make a fundamental difference to Exdeaths power level.  What does however is Dual Cast.  He gets it innately but how much stronger is Exdeath versus another mage with a DC materia?  Etc.  All mages who lack dual cast are on another level below automatically.  Give them DC and all of a sudden they are now on par with Exdeath plus or minus.  Massive power difference with  TMR slot.  So have a rating for both.,FFBraveExvius,dajo5pj,1,t5_34n2x

But these Green Tickets will be as Difficult as Trial ! And if somehow you manage to three Star all of the Stages in the Ticket Tower you will unlock a st Stage in the Ticket Tower. This Ticket Is so rare and so powerful that the power of a God wont even be able to slightly damage it. This Ticket is known as The Rainbow Ticket. If you complete this Stage you will get a Rainbow Ticket as the first Clear Reward!

9842020,0,t1_daqe4rl,Dude...I even...I do understand the math haha. It takes on average  NRG to get  skillup for a single character but youre running  characters at once so on average youre spending  NRG per .This makes the assumption you are running  identical units intending to fuse them. Otherwise you are still averaging NRGskillup. In other words it takes NRG which is how we have to compare it to a  Trust Moogle since Moogles can only be applied to a single unit.Starting next week I will be running ELT at an assumed total rate of  assuming Lightning as  base  friend unit LightningVanillex Snow LightningxNow watch this neat stuff As Im writing this given the numbers from the survey of Gearsrun assuming an expected  Metal Gigantuar rate and Gearsrun no Metal Gigantuars we have xx. or NRG  runs so really NRG for a  Trust Moogle. Even if I dont encounter any Metal Gigantuars I will have xx. or NRG  runs so really NRG for a  Trust Moogle.On to the k moogles! Same concepts With Metal Gigantuarsxx. or NRG  runs so really NRG. Without Metal Gigantuars xx. or NRG  runs so really NRG.Note Unit conversion for the equation is GearsGearsRunNRGRunGearsRunGearsNRGRunRunNRGRunNRG.So in summary the k Moogle will take me between NRG and the k will take me between NRG to obtain. Plus on top of that it will take me far less time to grind out k gears while working no less than to wait  days grinding Earth Shrine which I cant do while working for a single unit. Add to that I can just fuse  of these guys to a single unit in about a minute instead of grinding  days when I do get a unit I will use them on like Gilgamesh.As it is right now Im in Earth Shrine grinding away. Next week I will be grinding the event until I have what I want then back to Earth Shrine.Now tell me whats more efficient?,FFBraveExvius,daqfse5,7,t5_34n2x

9859802,0,t1_daskeov,gt Strictly better means that it is better in every single situationAlso you use optmized defense on your case about the gloves. but on Hammer example you use sub optimal setup.With the following equips wich are arguably the best setup for WoL without TM  WoL maxed with pots get DEF and  HPForce Shield Survivor Helm  Force Armor DEFSPR Muscle Belt DEFHP Muscle Belt Destroyers Authority Destroyers Authority HP   HPNow using actual optmized value of  HP and  DEF the hammer adds  survival and the gloves adds  survival. People might argue that a  difference is small but still a difference and at worse means that both are equivalent.

9873781,0,t1_dau2ktl,Honestly due to how repetitive running these events are... even a new TMR farming alternative will get boring fast. Maybe a better alternative is to just have a  chance for a Moogle to appear in dungeons or explorations. Killing that moogle will drop a  Trust Moogle for you to enhance on any one character. This is similar to those random Gigantaurs you can find in explorations... the ones that drop either Star Quartz or Screamroots. Make a new Moogle monster... give it a rare chance of appearing in dungeons and explorations... this way you can still keep doing a daily routine and be TMR farming at the same time. For dungeons Im imagining something more like the BF Events where if a Metal God appears the amount of stages in the dungeon will increase by . Of course like yours this is just a personal preference for an alternative to the Devs vision of obtaining TMRs.,FFBraveExvius,daukscb,2,t5_34n2x

This might be a struggle with  Cecil.TLDR Maxwells LB on  enemies generates enough crystals for both Cecil and Maxwell to spam their LBs most of the time maybe  of the time or so. Milking Maranda Coast for maximum LBs takes a while maybe  minutes? but you can get over  LB uses for  energy.There are a lot of little things you can do to maximize this strategy Equip Cecil with poison immunity Star Pendant and regen Angel Ring. Maximize Cecils health pool Muscle Belts etc. so that regen heals for more. Equip Cecil with minimal ATK. No weapon works nicely. Dual wield Excalipoors might help LB crystal generation I havent tried it. Dont use Maxwell to generate LB crystals  she kills stuff too fast. Minimize Maxwells MAG stat to limit the damage done by her LB. Unequip her Esper. Make sure Maxwell is otherwise reasonably tough so you dont wipe on the shark boss at the end.The first zone has fights that are mostly  enemies and its kind of slow going but still decent.

While you will eventually want them both leveled up I would actually use the fact that you have them both to give Refia priority. No matter what tank you want to use at any given time you always want a good healer.Bartz is a solid unit you will eventually want to level up even if only for Human Elixir fights. But it is a lower priority.Youre in a similar spot as I am I pulled a Vaan recently but theres very little reason to have a  Vaan when you have WoL. Level him up but the priority is Low.My suggestion is to focus on Refia where possible she gets your cactuars for instance. Then level up either WoL or Cecil.

9915220,0,t1_dazyg37,Educating myself on future units and banners helped me to curb my need to spend the tickets that were burning a hole in my pocket.If you are FP many of the units coming out are only slight upgrades from the existing ones. Ace is better than ExDeath when you have him decked out in TMRs but without TMRs you are just as well off with Ex. That helps kill my desire to pull hard for Ace when his banner eventually comes.I also looked at toptier  units and banners they are on. Rikku is wellknown as an amazeballs  unit for instance. And JP got a second Tidus banner like the current second lightning banner that has both Tidus and Rikku on one banner! If I pull hard for Tidus and dont get him theres a good chance Ill grab a Rikku and still have a significant upgrade to my team. Similarly Balthiers banner has Ashe another supersolid  base unit.Knowing that Gilg isnt that great without TMRs and knowing whats coming down the pipeline... thats what stays my ticket pulling hand.,FFBraveExvius,dazz6u1,1,t5_34n2x

Even if you stuck with the Lightning account you would have to look for a healer potentially a mage progress and regear all of these characters. If you are about rank  or so after  months I dont think there will be too much motivation to level these characters all up again get the event currency for the awakening materials and such will be too appeal to your play time.,FFBraveExvius,db2fkli,1,t5_34n2x

9946143,0,t1_db3z47v,Counterpoint Most healers have massive SPR anyway. Because of the way defenses work they have diminishing returns the more you get which is the opposite of how attacking stats work as they have an exponential function so you get even more benefit as you stack more. As an example  a unit with  SPR like Refia will see maybe  less damage by going up to  SPR. Meanwhile a Cecil with  SPR perhaps would see a  damage reduction going to  SPR. The percentages arent correct its just as example to illustrate but generally a tank with relatively low SPR will be getting much more out of the protective aspect than a healer. At the same time a healer like Refia would get much more out of DEF than a tank for much the same reason.Also important to note that while much magic damage cannot be blocked by a tank Cecils Saintly Wall only reduces damage from physical damage anyway. With relatively low SPR he can be a bit of a damage sponge when it comes to strong magic attacks. Beefing him up with SPR which tanking gear is generally somewhat light on is a pretty good use of the pots IMO.,FFBraveExvius,db40a5s,1,t5_34n2x

9955824,0,t1_db570b4,However there is a point to be made with unojikomaru statement.Given that there are more units in the pool would lend credence to RNG simply having more to draw from when doing a pull.  Have we thought about what this means in hindsight however?  I assume most of us have been doing summons since the early days of the GL release.  At that time before all the units we have now were added in we had an incredibly small pool of units to draw from.  Between the influx of newer units and our own memories of Shadow showing up  times in a pull  months ago isnt it somewhat possible that our own observation bias is affecting how we view pulls with the diluted pool we now have?Im not saying its a culprit I think in some ways it could be a combination of both but I dont think we can dismiss the additional units that have been added over the months.,FFBraveExvius,db59otw,0,t5_34n2x

10017727,0,t1_dbdbvi8,Gilgamesh Elza Lightning Cecil Refia as team. You dont need DKCecil because using him is a bit more hassle than the others due to you needing to take care of him not killing himself. WoL isnt needed for a tank because Cecil is a better tank as of right now. Hes only good for FullBreak but Elza can break more DEF than him. Switch him in only against a boss that needs it. Gilgamesh and Lightning are pure attackers on the team. Elza is your breaker and attacker. Note that she can break  DEFSPR and her Enfeebling Slash can inflict Disease which lowers  more. Cecil is your tank and side healer. Refia is your primary healer Embolden girl Esuna and Raiser. For DW stick it on Gilgamesh because Gilgamesh has Weapon Collector so you can increase his ATK further by equipping a combination of Katana Sword and Greatsword. Lightning already has innate DW and Elzas Dark Reaper doesnt stack with two weapons. For weapons... beat the Trials get TMR and wait for events.,FFBraveExvius,dbdc6qo,2,t5_34n2x

Since I view this as a long term investment in the hours of enjoyment Im overall happy especially compared to getting screwed on my purchases in a few other games.

10025241,1,t1_dbe4h13,I was referring to what happens whenever they change the half price daily pull banner.When Faris banner was changed she still showed up way too much even on the new banner. Then Fang same thing was still lingering way above average pull rate after the banner. This is the feeling I have and Ive read about others having the same experience mainly when pulling as soon as the new banner is out.I wouldnt be surprised if people get a lot of Charlotte even after they change this current banner. For every duplicate pull you dont want they make more money as you have to pull again. And even  from a duplicate pull towards a TM is a loss compared to using  lapis on Earth shrine so theres nothing positive with getting duplicates in that sense other than time.As with everything its always speculation and people here on Reddit like to downvote and call people tin foil hats when people question things.

Granted this is coming from someone who is willing to spend a considerable amount of money on a game like this to get a good team. I didnt mind dropping   pulls on the Halloween banner because I was just pulling for anything at the time and had I gotten either Rain or Lasswell it would have been a temporary boost to my team. Even now that Ive taken a more FP route due to  pulls worth of trash Im still overflowing with multiple stacks of all the awakening materials so Im not really conservative about dropping some on filler units and leveling them up because even though it might feel bad seeing those stacks fall below  I know that with the next currency event I can just grind them back over  again.Anyways I just got my Medius to  so now Im hyped.

Of the top  dps released to GL right now only Noct benefits from using Great Swords over other weapons an edge case can be made for Lightning to use them but I even then you only need two.When Orlandu gets released that will be a different story as he greatly benefits from two Excaliburs.

Murasame from White Dragon Trial   Force Armor from Devil Chimera   White Tiger mask from recipe one from quest   Black Belt Gi from recipe Hyper Wrist from recipe these can be used temporarily in place of Hero Rings Hero Rings from quest trophies  TMs are going to be the elusive ones for the time being youll eventually want the following Im including base rarity to give you some expectation on rarity.

10084084,0,t1_dbljakz,To the story? You go to Burmecia after Cleyra.After Burmecia the storys major focus to Freya is finished.But i wouldnt say that she becomes irrelevant. That is just wrong. She would become irrelevant if she was somehow extremely weak in comparison to the party or didnt care about the main storyvillain and took off.I would say Freyas story arc is mostly completed after the Queen Brahne last fight but then you find out that the Queen is just a pawntool.Even later you also learn that Kuja is also a pawn.So Freya still has reasons to fight to uncover the big mastermind behind the actions of Brahne.And also she fights with her friends.

When your Edgars are leveled you can grind Marsh. The boss is annoying but with leveled Edgars you can check the effectiveness of chaining electric attacks since the boss is weak against that.N.b.

What people are asking for is entire tiers of items added on top of the announced ones which is pretty different from turning on a stage that already had its clear reward set from the start and didnt change.,FFBraveExvius,dbp5cc2,1,t5_34n2x

10116431,0,t1_dbq2n9j,Yes.  TMs are either equippable items or equippable abilities that can go on any character that can use them e.g. you cant equip Moon Blade on Chizuru because she cant equip swords you also cant equip green magic for instance on a character without green magic affinity.When I first started I thought a Characters TM was applied to them specifically e.g. Chizuru would get an extra ability called Blade Mastery but thats not the case at all.,FFBraveExvius,dbq6g1r,2,t5_34n2x

Warp break is an effective .x mod as is currently which doubles on two hits to .x damage.Now if we got JP Noctis the LB instead does x.x as a range much larger of a chunk. On top of the  stat buff. And enabling his strongest combo skill which does an effective .x damage mod. Even comparing to JP Warp Break which does an effective x mod it seems good damage even with DW.,FFBraveExvius,dbtjrja,2,t5_34n2x

10143652,0,t1_dbtoh0p,Not really Noct is definitely a single target all his aoe damage is hybrid damage. Now between the two Elzas skill is definitely geared more towards single target but as a whole both of them are geared toward a single damage. Why is that well thats because both of them have a basically a . multiplier on a single target with Elza actually losing out on single target as her Madness Rush is random and Nocts is a more focused . effective multiplier on a single target. However what really seals the deal is that his LB is a . multiplier on a single target at LB rank  and  multiplier at  LB rank. But as support role Noctis does take the lead due to the fact that his flasks are all aoe damage and they as a whole can effect multiple units. Elza on the other hand can only do one unit. However for the most part the times you would really care about max potential damage outcome would be on bosses which are for the most part single target. ,FFBraveExvius,dbtpzy1,2,t5_34n2x

10145154,0,t1_dbtw71g, Its best to prioritize TMR that you can put to strengthen your best unit. Of course its also great if that TMR is a universal plugin. From your list ordered by importance . Power of Creation   ATKMAG.  star units have high base ATK which is brought higher by pots. Outside of weapons this will give the biggest boost. . Bracers   ATK is equivalent to around  ATK for a  unit averaging around  ATK. The  HP is also a very great bonus.. Brave Suit  Currently the best ATK clothes is Black Belt Gi which gives  ATK. Brave Suits  ATK will give around  ATK to a unit with around  ATK. Thats a  ATK upgrade.. Black Cowl  Currently the best ATK hat is a Tiger Mask that is craftable. Since thats  ATK this is only a  ATK upgrade which is the same as Brave Suit. However Brave Suit is  so depending on the unit and the use of stat pots it will provide a bigger boost. I should also mention since you have a Gilgamesh how come youre not farming his Genji Glove? Thats your most valuable TMR. Nope not a good idea. Ribbon is a very useful TMR thats great on multiple characters. Its good to keep duplicates of these around. Since you have  of him if you use this method youll be left with  copies only. In a way its more beneficial to save up more. You can just have Refia cast Esuna on Noctis for now.  Yep you should prioritize physical gear over magical gear. Personal preference but I say no for Mercedes and possibly for Exdeath.,FFBraveExvius,dbtx130,3,t5_34n2x

Dont bother with esuna leave that shit to CoDsomeone else via items Refia is most useful when she shits out curajas or embolden.Agrias cycle break the ivy first as you are killing it first break flower next cycle through with the breaks returning to refresh the break on ivy if needed.Cecil I believe you can get away with no using provoke but probably provoke tank until you kill a piece. I believe provoke curaja X  after the th curaja to cover the healing while Refia refreshes the embolden you can probably provoke again. I think? Alternate move is the more mana hungry focus buff. I had my BCL cover focus since her hex strike wasnt getting paralyzes on the flower at least half a dozen tries inbetween focus usage. LB when you can to conserve mp from refia. Level  cecil LB gives more than embolden.Damage friend unit Ideal is lightninglunethnoctis due to mana regen being super important  Unload hard for the first piece you want to lower anetollahs damage output asap. So its alright to use your big attacks at the start. You want an ifrit user plant killer passive and they also get access to raging fist which is useful on LunethLightning as you use raging fist and their passive mp regen to build up mana over the turns to use a better attacking move. Right now all the whales are rolling with diabolos and fire weapons for the event demon killer and fire elemental. Hopefully after they revert to the normal higher attack via ifrit and more neutral elemental loadouts.I personally did Ivy gt Leaves gt Roots gt Flower. This is wrong. Once you kill Ivy the damage potential isnt that bad and also you stop getting randomly paralyzed. I recommend killing roots after unless you have a strong noctis as the mp sap is just disgusting and forces you to use elixirs. The fight is hella long and you will be spamming heals regardless.Once any  pieces are down the fight gets a lot easier a lot more breathing room until you bring the solo flower down to . Remember to guard that turn on everyone but Cecil  the attacking friend who drops the flower down. Cecil uses heal to bump up health to safer threshholds and is tanky enough to live through it. Attacking friends DPS is needed to reliably bring the health down past threshhold. Do it for  and . Its pretty simple once the pieces start dropping albeit slow.With my line up I used  elixirs  turbo ethers  ethers  p downs a bunch of those status item fixers BCL usually using them. So yeah keep that in mind when I said I finished it. It was still long grueling hard and took probably  turns. I did finish it on my first attempt so I guess technically its easier than the maxwell diabolos challenge which took me  tries,FFBraveExvius,dbv8iy9,1,t5_34n2x

10216617,0,t3_5m54m3,I disagree a little bit regarding Elles TM.  I always see that you rate defensive TMs poorly and I think in some cases it is undeserved.  While Elles TM isnt amazing it is definitely good for healers who need an HP boost to get through high damage fights.  It could also be used on any of your tanks or DPS to get them that little bit extra they might need to survive a boss fight.  The TM alone doesnt make him a good unit... but if you were going to pull his TM is at least worthwhile for someone who isnt stacked full of  units or have a fully TMd team.  Particularly if youre pulling for D.Fina or Luka or both... because you NEED them... youll likely end up with enough Elles to get a few of his TM and realistically if youre pulling for Luka as your main healer upgrade or you really need the mage power that D.Fina would provide... youll likely also need that little bit of extra health and resistance that Elles TM will provide as well.  This still isnt enough to say Yes you should pull... but I know my Tilith I dont have Refia would greatly appreciate a few of Elles TMs to help keep her alive during long fights.  Honestly I will probably pull a few on this banner just because another good healer could be useful and hey  Shades of Fina... but ending up with a handful of Elles TMs wouldnt be a bad thing for my life either.  Then again Im not FP... so Im not worried about hoarding lapis or pulling ONLY on great banners.  As always  pulls are almost never worth it so keep that in mind too.,FFBraveExvius,dc240dq,2,t5_34n2x

10223062,0,t3_5mbg21,Hey guys.  Im really new and starting to read more about the game via wiki and such but Im feeling a bit at a loss for what to do.  I have a lvl  rydia that I recently woke up from  to  star.  Now I just used several summon tickets to try and get some better units.  I now have a bartz cecil terra at level one.  I before trying to get better units I poured quite a bit into rydia along with agrias who is also a  star at level .  Shes probably my best character at the moment.  Also have a santa roselia at level   star.  So the advice Im hoping for is for one a recommendation on who to be my dedicated friend character.  Was thinking rydia but agrias seems to be stronger all around.  I remember reading somewhere that rydia was a bit of a glass cannon but was capable of doing good dps later on.  Second question is whether I should stop using kuja and rain... and potentially rydia in favor of leveling up those level  characters i mentioned above which seem to rank much higher in the wiki associated with this subreddit.  TLDR  Should I slowly bring along my better summons or just cut my losses and pour resources into them.  fusing  star level  kuja?  fusing  star level  vanille?  Stuff like that.Hope thats readable and not a total lazyassed question.  I really want to make the most of my time on the game since progress is slow with RPGS and Id like to make the most of it.   Thanks all!,FFBraveExvius,dc2uaew,2,t5_34n2x

If I understand you correctly on banner  star base is . and off banner is the other half. So while the off banner crystals wouldnt change the rate of obtaining on banner  star base the chances of pulling an actual  star base would increase due to removing the plethora of units that pollute  star access.So the only real change is the off banner  star pull would be less likely to be trash whereas the on banner stays the same.Is that correct? ,FFBraveExvius,dc3u7sx,14,t5_34n2x

10248601,0,t1_dc5owe6,Disagree. Pulling is one of the things people actually find most fun in the game thats why people pay for it and play around on simulators. We like doing a little lottery. Even better if theres no cost which there isnt in rerolling just your time in going through the tutorial which you can macro so you dont even have to do it.Playing this game with garbage units quickly becomes far more grindy and unfun than any amount of grinding spent at the start to get a great carry unit. And that unit will make the rest of the game more accessible so many people end up quitting because they havent pulled a single good one.People starting today are at a disadvantage. Theyve missed good banners that for FPers especially were critical to getting good units for roles like Cecil and Refia. Theyve missed limited time event gear. One of the only ways to mitigate these losses is to take advantage of the only advantage they get which is ability to restart until they have a better unit.,FFBraveExvius,dc5qhjz,43,t5_34n2x

10289443,0,t3_5ncb3w,The reason I dont pay Gumi for this game isnt out of a lack of support. Its out of a condemnation for their business model and gaming practices. I am entirely open the the idea of supporting games that deserve it but with this games monetization set up as it is thats not the case right now.The problem with what you say throwing a little money will get you absolutely nothing in this game. You can throw hundreds of dollars and because its pure RNG with no guarantees you will never have any guarantee of getting what you want. This is in contrast to other games where you can buy specific characters for as little as .The only people who can be truely happy with how much theyve paid in this game and what they got out of it  of the time are the people who pay zero and the people who pay any amount necessary to get what they want. Anyone just offering up tokens of  or  here and there may get a few small luxuries but nowhere near enough to impact the game in a manner worth the money to me.The simple matter that you have to be prepared to spend hundreds if not thousands to get any sort of real bonus out of the game is the reason that I wont pay for it until it changes. That sort of money could buy you entire consoles and slews of other games which would offer you thousands of hours of more return in enjoyment than whatever RNG pixels you get in this one.If it altered systems to have pity timers rates to guarantee certain units etc Id possibly reconsider. Especially if the price was reduced to something anywhere near in line with DLC costs of other games. But being a gatcha game it likely wont so Im content being FP.

One is a current team to clear everything I possibly can and the second is a futureproof team so I know who to give potsgigantuars for the future.My overall roster is  Luneth   has enhancerexcal tiger mask black belt gi hyper wrist and power wrist. I know I need better armoraccy but Im not sure where to get these.  Dark Fina   has Empress Birch Red Cap Sages Robe and shitty defensive rings.  Cecil   Just waiting on awakening materials for him. Murasame Golden Shield Mythril Helm Mythril Armor Water Gods amulet Shining Bracer.   Lightning   Betelgeuse Flame Shield Green Beret Power Vest Hyper Wrist Power Wrist  Refia   Fire Rod Festival Cap Mages Habit Silver Armlet Earringsand my bench is  Rain  CoD  Firion  Chizurux  WoL  Agrias  Santa Roselia  Exdeathx  Bartz  Snow  Zidane x  Ludmillex  Hayate x  Miyuki x  Hope  Vanille  Arc.I have a lot of TMs worth farming for and the only ones I have atm are  Excal and Equip H Shield. I guess Im trying to figure out who my future team should be as well as where I should get gear thats not TM focused atm. The only trial I have done is Intangir and the first event I was able to complete was the Frosty one and only made it to the hat before it ended. I have Enhancer and Murasame as one time obtained weapons and thats about it. Im trying to get some progress in Coloseum but its taking a fair while.In addition Im trying to get the right Espers on the right characters right now my only maxed is on Luneth and thats Ifrit.Any tips?,FFBraveExvius,dcaqjve,1,t5_34n2x

Ive always had the same experience since bonus units were introduced feels grindy and impossible at first and an absolute breeze by the end of it.

10322305,0,t1_dce2scc,Of the units you listed here ExDeath and Santa Roselia can be upgraded to   . Cactuar and gil snapper events are limited time and will limited later. Right now your only source of   materials is Moogle King so buy those before the event ends. Gigantuars will level your units fast but make sure you have money to use them before buying large quantities.

10334662,0,t1_dcffo74,I think youre a very rare case.  The cost of running a computer with a macro going is not something that will every factor into anyones decision about whether the mechanics of the game are in favor of farming via macro or going to Moogles.  Its literally a nonissue to most people.

10336422,0,t3_5nzj3v,Your comment falls on totally deaf ears from everywhere.. Alim is probably not reading any of this.. All content especially that in JP is currently balanced against Dual Wield working as it is now.. This adjustment is NOT MINOR. ALL GAME CONTENT must be readjusted to compensate for this change.. Gumi could nerf Dual Wield in global. However based on ALL our player experience with them this means they must now tune test and readjustredesign  of all content past and future just to account for a change to how Dual Wield functions. Do you really think theyre going to do that?. Wheres there any benefit in tuning Dual Wield? Its not like there are real Player vs. Player interactions that depend on Dual Wield.. Are they killing their own design space? ABSOLUTELY. Do you think they care? Maybe. Next game might be better. . Proof of this? Mitigators in Brave Frontier. Pretty much centralised the entire game around their existence. ,FFBraveExvius,dcfowjj,4,t5_34n2x

10348949,0,t1_dcgtxi0,MP is already literally a joke and will become even more of one as we get more healers and supports that refresh MP like Tilith who refreshes so much MP the MP she spends on the ability is less than what she recovers. Tack on regeneration from Noctis Ramza plus natural base  autorefresh and it becomes almost a nonissue.And if it ever becomes one even after all of that you have  Full ethers and  Elixirs available in any given fight on top of that. If you are having any MP issues in any fight regardless of the duration you need to adjust your tactics or your team. MP is basically a nonlimiting factor already and its just going to become easier.But if you have a serious issue with the numbers thats why I said to simply adjust their HPMP values. Example. Esper has  HP and  MP. Instead of increasing it to  increase the esper to something like say  HP and  MP. Now you get  instead of  so not a x difference. Theres plenty of ways to better balance it so that they are not basically irrelevant stats on the esper.,FFBraveExvius,dch435t,1,t5_34n2x

10377484,0,t1_dckbf5e,I would still run Refia over Luka. Full raise is huge and  buff is enough to get through most fights. Even if you have to buff  times thats like  turns of healing in a  turn fight or  mp less than healing  times with Luka. Mp shouldnt be a big issue though. People put DC on Refia all the time and do just fine with it. Not to mention that having a buff available is way better than having no buff even if you opt not to use it. Also what else is your healer doing turn  any way? Until you start taking damage they just sit there. Might as well have your healer help dish out more damage while theyre just standing around. ,FFBraveExvius,dckcnyv,2,t5_34n2x

Then doing the event there. because events tend to use large or wonky texture files compared to the rest of the game. and given how new they are they rarely get tested and fixed quickly. and continue playing the game elsewhere on their phone.I had to do that with the Memories event.,FFBraveExvius,dcpgvs5,1,t5_34n2x

10474079,0,t3_5py2eh,I started with only  and  units for my game didnt really know much about the whole rerolling scene or doing that when I started playing. And I consider myself to be doing alright with that. Though I did pull an Ace from the Type banner right when it started which was my first . If you wanted to just reroll for Orlandu you would be waiting for awhile potentially. Unless we end up with a dual banner next week then you would be waiting another two weeks to start playing. Type banner ends on the th then the Lunar banner which the units might be exclusive on it starts and runs for two weeks. Also Ariana ends next Thursday which is a free  that uses just her event materials to get to  so its like getting a free . Ariana is a decent magic caster and support. Her exclusive gear you can farm pretty easily in the event gives her a nice boost along with you can craft two of her microphones for if you do get extra Dual Wield stuff can give it to her. Her Trust Master RewardTMR boosts Atk and Mag when equipped with an instrument by . Her microphone is the only one handed instrument in the game at the moment but is exclusive to her. Rerolling  unless you are lucky or if it is the banner probably its very time consumingat least to me. I had decided last week to try it out on the Nox program to see what I could get from rerolling. Doing it a few hours a day over the past week while Im doing other things on the PC I have gotten   Base and that was yesterday. Which was an Ace. I had received one  before last Friday through rerolling but was a Terra who currently caps at  currently getting a  later. I started playing at the very end of December when was over at a friends place in another city for New Years since they play as well. They had started in October and Im mostly caught up to them with a few of my units in terms of stats. But of course they have more diversity and team comps they can put together. But you would be able to get that as well over time. So I would say this game is very beginner friendly yes I miss not having some of the event items there was some decent ones. But eventually there will be even better things. So gives you time to get your party up to be able to farm those things when they come out.

So shes meant to attack since she has  DMG to humans and  Crit to go along with all her self buffing Atk from steps. Like step step step stab P ,FFBraveExvius,dcvpd24,2,t5_34n2x

10479133,0,t3_5q1omb,So assuming you put DW on him it looks like normal attacks with Yun will hit  times.  If you use his  power up every other turn that averages out to about the same as a dual wielded  attack per turn but with no chaining ability.assuming the bonus applies to all  normal attacks in the following turn not just the first Granted this costs very little mana.  Does anyone know if a  atk bonus will do more than a normal  damage multiplier since its upping the atk stat itself and not just the damage?  I know every atk point scales quadratically so yun may actually do more than this  multiplier it appears to be.  Furthermore would aurora scarf double his number of attacks yet again?  If so I think he would dethrone Orlandu just for his raw damage increase.  Really depends on the details of how his skills workstack.  He could also be very underwhelming.,FFBraveExvius,dcvx25t,2,t5_34n2x

10480008,0,t3_5q14lz,Ive been playing since last Saturday and have been running almost exclusively the maze since it appeared since it seemed to be the thing to do at the moment. My question is what do I do with all the mini cactuars Im getting? I know about getting friend point units to level and sell but right now I have about  more mini cactuars than friend point units I can summon. They dont seem to be worth the gil to infuse.

10485889,0,t1_dcwk9yi,You can awaken units to different rarities so generally you just focus on units that reach  star as their stats and abilities generally outshine other units of similar roles. These would beCecil Xiao Dangerous Ariana DA Ace Refia Exdeath Cloud of DarknessCoD Cerius Medius and Rain.Youll want Cecil and Refia in almost everything to keep your team alive no better tank or healer on the list. Since you dont have any stellar DPS e.g. Luneth Lightning etc. I would put Exdeath in for damage ideally but you need to max him out first. Xiao getting  star will make her good too and I would give Rain the last seat though you have a long way to max him out since he has buffs and debuff on all stats.For an immediate team to use now I would say Cecil Refia Xiao Ace DA for Buffs. Levelling Exdeath and Rain on the side to replace Ace and DA respectively is a good goal for the future. Now thats going to make a good general team but you may also want to sub CoD for more options in trials and stuff so leveling her is worthwhile too.,FFBraveExvius,dcwonoy,1,t5_34n2x

We should avoid Orlandus banner like a plague and seize good  base units such as WoL Rikku Tilith etc. Ling falls into this category IMO at least until we get Tiliths upgrade and Rikku.

Be sure to equip them with a nice weapon andor run them through Chamber of Experience once. Im not sure when the last time you updated was but this has also been fixed in the latest build of Ultimate TM. It has an auto click added every  minutes.

A unit keeps all of its limit burst levels when it is awoken so the cheapest most efficient way to have a maxed out limit break on a char is to level it up as far as possible at a lower rarity.That being said your Cecil or whatever isnt useless and honestly if you only have  it is worth raising to  right away imo and then whenif you roll another one to raise it up as a side project with burst pots or macroing to eventually replace your current cecil.,FFBraveExvius,dd9d2wj,2,t5_34n2x

Support units Those can be your healersupport units get their HP and spirit up for survivability and stronger heals dual cast is very helpfully. Tanks Tanks usually can survive with FTP materials getting TMRs is just a qol thing so I worry about them the least. Since you already have a strong DD unit you could work on another DD unit as well as your support unit you can farm  TMs at the same time so spread them between your second DD unit and a support unit.

10726676,0,t1_ddmccuw,gt Now a couple of things DK Cecil unless you have barrage is not going to cut it as a damage dealer.It definitely feels this way. Leading up to the boss hes great. I can control aggro and damage mitigation enough to use Soul Eater without fear and since most of my friend Noctii have Excalibur Ive always got the right element to nuke the boss quickly and his damage actually does a nice job of keeping up with Noctis during this section. Unfortunately Abraxas does not offer that kind of luxury. Reveling in his AoE I cant afford to toss  of my health away even though Krile can outheal that its not enough to also mend the damage inflicted by Abraxas. Unfortunately Im stuck with him. Hes the only truly strong DPS Ive got.I have Rain leveled up but that MP cost is steep and I dont even know what he even could do in the turns between using Leadership. Ramza can survive and will AutoRefresh the cost allowing my Dualcast Ling to focus on just about everything else besides being an MP battery at least thats why I chose him over Rain.As for Snow should I be Provoking or letting his innate Draw Attacks carry that burden? I Provoke on the first turn but then he eats a whole lot of free damage that brings him insanely close to death. I guard after that but its never pretty all the way up until he gets Swallowed. Once hes gone the rest of my team gets nuked by chains of Double Break Breath. It really feels like he does  attacks each turn outside of his WindupRelease turns of course.Thanks for the offer though. Ill definitely try adding you. And I think Ill stop trying to play around supposed triggers as well.EDIT Im actually going to bed here for now its  am for me and even insomniacs have to pass out at some point so would it be okay if I added you when I woke up?

10746509,0,t3_5tqtoc,TM priority question for a FPer. Feel free to critique any aspect of my methodologyplans.I have but one dual wield Im currently working on  more dws dualcast and two blade masteries.My planned squad is Pecil ChizChiz Luka and one other. That one other can be Bartz CoD ExD or DKCecil. I know theyre probably situational but if I want to do the most damage especially single target would chaining my Chizs into Bartzs Wind Shear be the way to go until I get a solid DPS or DKCecil gets his enhancements? Im working as if thats the case hence two blade masteries and letting Bartz go with Enhancer and Wizard Rod and just working crazy chains. My next TM Farms would be Miyuki for Chiz Omnirod for BartzExD and Rising Sun BartzCoD along w one more dw and dc though Im open to input on order here or to swapping one of these for oneboth of the BMs on my current slate. I also have Excalibur and Deathbringer floating around  but I dont have the units to utilize them atm I dont think the benefit to throwing them on Bartz and losing his damage boost from wielding a sword outweighs  more dmg on each chiz. Also Im rank  right now and will probably TM farm w lapis once I hit  until I get those first  dw dw dc bm bm and definitely would more if I pulled a unit that would utilize deathbringer and excalibur.

10759181,0,t3_5twiy6, of the way into OPs post I was really hoping there would be a mathbased conclusion on a FPs breakeven point. Something along the lines of If you have spent  Daily pulls or  tickets on this banner and still dont have a bonus unit stop pulling. Youll end up with less overall lapis  tickets if you continue to pull past this point.Since that wasnt the conclusion made maybe I should take a crappy stab at it. You can get up to  tickets on a King Mog event and at  lapis a pop thats  lapis worth of tickets that you can get. I will assume that the goal of a FP or minnow player is to come out ahead on a King Mog event you want to get the musthave rewards if you can but still end up with more lapis  tickets than you started with. Saving up those  tickets for a good future banner is pretty important to a lean spender.Instead of doing all the math myself lets start with the wonderful table made by uLedgeEndDairy. Averaging  friend unit bonuses for ELT or  for PRO can get you pretty much everything you need from an average King Mog event as long as you can stay dedicated for the entire  weeks. If your friends are pulling good enough bonus units and you dont mind the grind you need not spend on any on a King Mog event.If you decide to use tickets obviously dont spend more than  chasing event units thats the hard breakeven point. If you spend  on day  hoping to get that bonus and end up with  event units stop there. You can still get the tickets and the main equipment item or skip the equipment and get gigantuars   awakening materials without your own bonus unit. But since RNG didnt favor you this time you might not get the materia the Magicite SQ etc. Better luck next time.If you do Daily pulls all  pulls is the break even point for  tickets. As long as you get the tickets you can Daily every day and not end up behind in lapis  tickets. However each successive pull leaves you with less time left to take advantage of the units bonus. After  days of Daily pulls the bonus from a pulled unit is half as effective since you have half the time with which to use it. The effective bonus of a unit as applied to the table goes down every day and is only at half value for a Day  pull.  Any Daily pull is not likely to be worth it after day  for a FPstyle player simply due to the decreased time with which to use that bonus. Again if you didnt manage to pull a bonus unit make do without the extra rewards and just focus on the core items this time.So I guess a tldr for my long rambling rant is this if you are FP and determined to come out ahead spend less than  tickets on day  or do Daily pulls and stop at or before Day .,FFBraveExvius,ddpqala,8,t5_34n2x

10773181,0,t1_ddqp4dw,Increasing elemental resistances is always good but if you have to choose between increasing DEFSPR vs. HP Id still go with HP if youre talking about same  increase because normally the  increase applies to BASE attributes only.  Heres a post I did a few weeks back when debating about HP vs DEFCorrect but that assumes that  will have same effects  in reality the effect of base DEF increase will be smaller than effect on base HP increase. So for the most part HP would be more attractive especially as equipment selection has a greater effect on DEF.Lets take your example  say I have random character with HP and DEF naked.  HP or  DEF will have same effect.    HP  HP  AxA  ATK hit    DEF  HP  AxA  ATK hitNow lets put some armor on him for simplicitys sake say a DEF helmet    HP  HP  AxA  ATK hit    DEF  HP  AxA  ATK hitThe one with DEF now has a lower threshold before going kaput. Now compound this with multiple materias and the higher effect of HP and youll see a widening gap.Note that this also doesnt take in to account arena where damage is capped at  or n where n is chained hit  in this case DEF increase is even less effective than HP ,FFBraveExvius,ddr6bjn,7,t5_34n2x

You can also level them up and awaken them for the achievement. At this point I just sell the ones I dont need. Sure you could feed them to your units but Id rather save the gil.      Yes. LBs are a long and slow grind but you can make it a bit more bearable by LB farming prior to awakening since once a unit is awakened to a higher rarity it will require much more LB to reach the same level. Other thing to note about LBs is that they dont transfer or sum if you fuse two of the same units together. ,FFBraveExvius,ddvvzcj,2,t5_34n2x

Thats a joke by the way Ah I see what you mean... well if youre speaking to someone in English the article rules are still based on phonetics and I cant imagine any other way to pronounce a word beginning with ex so I think were safe DMore seriously though the etymology for both ex ex and vius have roots in Latin although vius itself is a rarelyused conjugated form of via  Theres some room for interpretation since its a dead language and all but I would imagine exvius means from the way or of this method.  Which could be taken either literally or figuratively when adding English brave before it.  Perhaps they were going for Brave Journey or even less inventive Brave Frontier as the game is literally adapted from.This has been discussed before here and here and one person follows the same thoughts I had about the etymology but I dont think theres been any official definition released.,FFBraveExvius,ddwsaht,1,t5_34n2x

10835456,0,t1_ddxgxnp,Err saving if you want to be able to grind a ton when you actually have time to play the game makes sense. Saving if youre going for every single reward in a farm event makes sense. But saving your energy so you can just get back to farming TMRs makes absolutely no sense unless youre otherwise never running out of energy.You realize that saving up  energy to use and blitz an event so you can go back to TMR farming is literally the same as if you just used that  energy to TMR farm before the event. No matter what in a week or two week period you have the same amount of energy to use. Saving it up to burst at one moment isnt any different than using it more dispersed throughout the weeks.The reasons to save all basically come down to not having time to spend it and that you dont want to waste time generating more.,FFBraveExvius,ddxln3o,1,t5_34n2x

10838323,0,t1_ddxh5lf,Are your benched units fully leveled? Id suggest to use Cecil and Ling instead of your tank Noctis and CoD. Cecil with Mirage Vest can take the hits and cover very well and Lings Dance of Rebirth is invaluable if the boss kills several units with his sweep.You can use your team like this Noctis Cover Thunder Flask and Comeback. Luka spamming Priestess Miracle Cecil mostly Mirage Provoke Limit Break Ling Jack of all trades with her various dance skills. Exdeath Thundaga chaining with another Exdeath and Noctis Thunder Flask or DC Meteor friend Exdeath Thundaga chaining with another Exdeath and Noctis Thunder Flask or DC MeteorFor the normal enemy encounters you can use Pauls Escape TMR Smoke Bombs or DC GravigaOsmose with your Exdeath and FirageOsmose with friend mage. Build up your LBs on the way.When the boss fight starts buff yourself chain  Thundagas or more just make sure the Mines dont drop below  and blindsleep with Ling.Kill them in turn  heal up and cast Mirage with Cecil.Once the Sergeants are summoned you want to kill them as fast as possible with DC Meteors or Thundaga chains. Blind them with Ling or Noctis to mitigate the dmg.If you can survive the Sergeants its a cakewalk after that.

I dont do anything with the other party members unless I need to e.g. reviving removing debuffs finishing off a target.  As it stands arena is just something I casually farm to reach a threshold for my monthly trust moogle and the occasional stat potsitems.Until we can save unique setups for gear and espers I honestly have no desire to take a more creative approach to arena.  I dont have the patience to reequip everything when going between different game modes.  Its even worse when I get unfavorable bans and need to swap gear.  I am more than happy to do it for Trials and tough boss fights though because I dont need to repeat it after Im done.

I pulled a few trollthe first  were before  base units anyways rainbowsGilbert Fencer Edge Rydia but also got some good rainbows as well Noctis Lightning D.Fina. My first  rainbows were on averageabout every  pulls after that I got bombarded with  rainbows in  months. Basically I did my only  pullIm a FP for the noct banner and actually got him. Shortly after that I dumped about  tickets into the D.Fina banner just hoping for a Luka and got D.Fina. Pulled the Lightning from daily pullsover time my Lightning was pulled during the FF Type  event. Then pulled a troll Rydia during SoM event.On the positive side at least if a rainbow comes now it cant be a troll rainbow.

It seems elemental coverage needs to be handled each round so any unit providing coverage is now a dedicated attacker and all roles must be filled by remaining party members. If thats the case then maybe Rain  Lightning or Snow for my elemental coverage and then some combination of Cecil Luka Refia Ling for tanksupporthealing and then my Noctis friend providing the DPS?I was also considering gearing Rain with ExcaliburCoral Sword instead of Survival Edges so hes now covering Earth Fire Light and Lightning and then giving Survival Edges to Snow so hes covering Water and Air.

11022220,0,t3_5x89vd,A question about gearing Gilgamesh.I recently pulled him and am currently working on his TM. At this point Im not really sure on the weapons I should use for him though.Right now Im working on DKC for Deathbringer. The best katana I have available is Murasame with  ATK but I already have this equipped on Chizuru. I dont have Miyuki for Sakurafubuki but I do have Agrias and Cecil available for TM farming. I also have a second Chizuru and Leon for their TMs. Should I use Save the QueenExcalibur? Would I benefit more from a sword like Phantasmal Blade combined with Leons TM? Should I pray to RNGesus to bless me with my first Miyuki?,FFBraveExvius,dehc70i,1,t5_34n2x

Your strongest weapon for Chizuru would be Murasama and it wont be easy gearing for her she could chain quite well using phantom shadow with another Chizuru. Getting a good weapon wont be easy for Nine as well since the strongest FP spear for him would be Holy lance and that is located at the latest map Zoldaad and you need  Star Quartz to trade for it.,FFBraveExvius,dei1u6g,1,t5_34n2x

I personally prefer luka but am still trying to make refia work by farming the autorefresh from c lunaI think if youre using a ling id probably go with luka....if you dont have DC its definitely luka and with a DC maaaaaybe refia?That being said I have DC and refia but im not feeling her too much.  ,FFBraveExvius,deik1wf,4,t5_34n2x

Now you have a lot more good common units. Exdeath Firion Xiao even Rain are really good and can carry you through the whole game. Thats not mentioning the plethora of  base that awaken to  like Snow Shine or Primm. They may not be the absolute best in their categories but theyre definitely strong enough to carry you through all the content.I dont recommend putting too much expectation on these upcoming units unless you absolutely need to have the top  unit in order to enjoy this game.

It has no effect when the tank has to cover from single target attacks though.,FFBraveExvius,deo0nv7,1,t5_34n2x

My first  are going to be Dual Wield Blade Mastery x Quick Assault x. Depending on what Im doing I use a mix of Cecil Luneth Olive Chizuru Dark Fina and Luka. Ill be raising another Chizuru eventually but have no more gigantuars. What should be my next set of ? Other than the ones I use in my team I have of note x Shine Bartz Kefka x Shantotto Snow Vanille x Sheraone at  Agrias x LeonNot sure if his TMR is useful maybe on Cecil but that takes away tank stats.Think Im leaning toward Cecil Olive Bartz and x Shine but Im not sure.

11104670,0,t1_deqn5us,LB farming will hopefully get easier and easier on GL if they follow JP progression.  This is because between Arena Medal exchanges which have LB pots Arena weekly awards which on JP are generally LB pots and weekend Enchanted Mazes ... I hope this comes soon to GL...  LB farm becomes a breeze.That being said  since these options are not yet available consistently for GL players it really depends on which you find more tedious... or less tedious. If you are aiming for the LB trophy then single target  repeat is better than fullauto.  If you are just running the same thing over and over again and dont really want to have to pay attention autobattle.Remember  this is a game.

11141309,0,t1_deunfho,Id argue your interpretation of relevant is incorrect. Its widely accepted that theres multiple tiers of units. GodprestigeStier HighmainAtier Everything else below Im too lazy to listLuka easily falls into the highmainAtier category. She ranks  on Altema. After enhancements shes situationally better than Refia the baseline for healers. Youre equating relevant to godprestigeStier. I consider Atier units relevant to the meta. Are they the absolute best? No. But by that standard neither is Tilith since in the longer term Ayaka is significantly better and isnt a limited unit.As for Lightning...thats a very poor example. To be perfectly honest Lightning is now actually a BAD unit assuming access to DWGenji Gloves. She has lowtoaverage  base stats low damage modifiers mediocre chaining and no weapon passives. Thats BAD. Just about every  base is better than Lightning with a few TMs not even full BIS. So in Lightnings case shes not relevant to the meta because shes bad not because shes not nearly as good.,FFBraveExvius,deuutwa,1,t5_34n2x

11155546,0,t1_dewfn8z,Well for story content you dont even need TMs to clear it. Until recently it was possible to complete all story quests and all achievements attached to them with just story units.For trials though its a huge difference which is where well always see the difficulty level. The difference between a  HP Refia with  HP Dualcast Curajas and an  HP Refia with  HP Dualcast Curajas could save you from a wipe. For every  turns I actually save an action with my healer which means I can possibly actually utilize Embolden in lengthy fights whereas if Im running it with no defensive TMs whatsoever Im probably gonna be living turn to turn and just barely being able to top off my HP. Personally I found Gilgamesh to be the easiest trial yet in relativity to current BiS units anyway. I was expecting it to be this impossible feat that I had no hope of completing for quite some time because I have no  bases. Well I went in there and nearly got all  achievements on my first attempt. I actually would have but just before the  Threshold I autoattacked with Bartz instead of using him to refill Refias mana. I ended up having to waste Primms turn to Elixir Refia back to full instead so the noitems one went away.I couldnt say the same thing if I had gone in without a TMd Refia. She was truly the MVP of the fight. ,FFBraveExvius,dewgwqk,2,t5_34n2x

Its usually mass stopsstatusdeaths or in some unlucky cases enough dwing hits to do over k AOE damage and the fight ends there before my turn. Ling healing up isnt a wasted turn.

11166726,0,t1_dewwj8u,I hope this helps you make a choice to prioritize your farm. Remember that the  factor should be how much fun a unit feels. If you enjoy a particular playstyle its okay to go with it even if its not the strongest.Cheap unitsCheap units are the units that can have a lot of impact with very little farm. Theyre extremely useful when starting out because they allow you to clear content very early. They may not still be your main team in a few months but in the immediate future theyll give you the best return on investment. Xiao can do a ton of damage after you max her out and gets stronger when unequipped unless you unlock some TMs. This means you dont have to farm a good weapon for her and can put your best weapon on a secondary damage dealer. Max her to level  add ATK pots on her add a couple of Hero Rings and ATK and you get yourself a unit that can reach  ATK easy. She has a self buff in game that gives her a  ATK bonus turning her into a physical damage hitting machine. Firion Firions damage comes more from his passive than his innate stats. He gets so many bonuses that he duplicates the power of your equipment.  Hes great to equip your nd or rd best weapon and will completely destroy plants insects birds demons beasts and dragon. Unlike Xiao Firion can be enhanced even further with TMRs since more weapons will proc more passive bonuses. Cerius is a defensive support unit which means she doesnt rely on stats as much. So save your pots for someone else. Shes not always useful but when she is youll be so glad you have her. Shes incredibly good at boosting your teams elemental resistance which can effectively incapacitate some bosses. Bonus Cerius might be very useful for the upcoming raid event. Just something to keep in mind. Rain is also potentially the best support in the game. Hes got amazing buff spells debuff spells and he can elemental chain fire and earth. Again as a support you really only need to raise them to level . No need to worry too much about equipment or pots. You mainly need these units so they cast their amazing spells. Support units should not be your main damage dealer anyway. Cupid Artemios can be built as a damage dealer with very decent damage potential but this will require getting good equipment and pots. On the other hand you can build him as a support to take advantage of Amp Up the strongest ATKMAG buff in the game right now its just absolutely insane. Its a bit cheesy but incredibly effective. On the other hand you can always build him as a damage unit but it will require a good bow as well as other stats items. Bartz can bring a lot of utility to the table. At  he unlocks a powerful support spell that can transform the way you fight note your Primm can learn Life Giver to combo very well with him. Bartz is also really good at enabling units that depend on their LB like Cecil. Its possible to build him for high damage but he wont go as high as some other damage units. Long term unitsEven without farming TMRs these units will require more farm to be effective. On the plus side their ceiling is much higher meaning they can ultimately become very powerful. Exdeath needs a good rod Wizards Rod from the Surging Menace and a couple of earrings to be good. With Letters and Arms can he really unleash crazy magic. Hes got Dual Black Magic and good elemental coverage so he can chain really well. You can also build a team around his LB for great AoE ailment attacks. Primm is a support unit with strong offensive potential. However it requires a lot of farm to reach her high potential. She does a lot of hybrid damage which relies on stats. Finding good equipment that boosts both ATK and MAG can be difficult however if you manage to do it you can have a support unit with damage potential comparable to a solid damage unit. Shine does a ton of single target damage. She has a weird playstyle where she wastes a turn marking her target with Surprise Attack to come back with insane damage on the following turn. Its pretty interesting and works very well with buffer supports. She severely lacks AoE options though so it may limit you. Its definitely possible to give her AoE options by playing around her LB. This will require specially crafted team and only really works in multiround fights. I consider her late game because on top of requiring stats and equipment she requires your team to be built around her or even better she requires a better damage unit that her.VerdictMy order of priority would be. one of XiaoFirion Get one strong unit asap. You can rely on it to clear events and seasonal content you dont want to miss out on.. one of RainCupid ArtemiosCerius Get a very strong support up and running as early as possible.. Exdeath Because some fights need magic damage.. Pick your all star At this stage you have enough damage to clear most of the content at least at a PRO level. Pick one unit and groom it to the max. Take its damage to the highest possible stat. Farm whatever Rulers rings you need just get this unit as high as possible.. Pick one TM to focus on. Pick a good one. Start forming a TM team ideally with  duplicates of the same unit. Farm at your own pace some people will go more aggressively than others but its essential you have this party ready. ,FFBraveExvius,dexqj4j,2,t5_34n2x

The units in this game just kinda... flop about.With FFBE I knew I was going to love it the moment I played my first battle.

I have multiple redundancies and I only lose to ELT if one of two things happen  either I fail to break his Atk or he gets one of his lucky nuke rounds which fortunately hasnt happened in awhile.Coverage  I have Dualcast Curaja Esuna on Refia and Cecil.  Ramza has Esuna.  So no matter what if Gilgamesh or my friend becomes paralyzed I can remove it and heal.  I have MAGSPR from Cecil ATKDEF from Refia and Ramza so even when I have to heal I can always keep my buffs up.  In emergencies I can Rime if need be.   Ramza also has really good MAG and ATK breaks if I cant get a Noc friend or Warp Break fails to break ATK in that first round.Elemental Weapons  For the life of me I dont know why I dont see people using elemental weapons to chain.  I have a lot of Olivia and Yun friends both of which reduce Ifrits fire resist.

11260148,0,t1_df85m9f,Exactly. People forget how important current unit composition is. Orlandeau fits people that already have a lot of good units and need to upgrade those into something even better for FP with less unit availability Noctis is arguably the best unit they can get because he fits so many roles AND does crap ton of damage at the same time. You cannot lose with Noctis but having only Orlandeau will still make you struggle with harder content. I think imo theres a good reason Gumi put this banner running so shortly after the PC banner its a very smart economic decision. They give people a banner that gives them everything they want and people WILL pull because if you dont youre just stupid AF only exception would be if you absolutely do not need any unit because you already have all of them AND their TMs in sufficient amounts and then they pull the most hyped characters banner directly after. It will force people to spend more lapis and thus money. The smart thing is to of course save your stuff for later on. If you also already have a decent team you dont need Orlandeau. Thats another thing people forget. ,FFBraveExvius,df8bkfk,7,t5_34n2x

Im talking about the set that has a good team setup strategy and are more than capable of clearing it or at least getting his life below  every run with the right friend but cant because of RnG break resist. There is a difference between making it hard and not properly balancing it. TMRs or massive chaining damage are the only two starts that work consistently the slow and steady have too much RnG. ELT should be for the elite but in this case ELT means you were lucky enough to pull good chaining units or have TMRs like ribbon goddess protection etc  or RnGesus smiles upon and make him ST hit often and dont use a crap ton AoE moves or paralyze the units you couldnt equip with paralyze resist and your breaks dont get resisted each one of these strategies requires RnG,FFBraveExvius,dfbcg3v,1,t5_34n2x

11297894,0,t3_617eji,Haha this might honestly be me in a few hours but not because of salt.I have been saving for about  months. I also have already decided that I cant afford spending on FFBE anymore. Orlandeau is the first unit in awhile that Ive wanted which means Im gonna blow my reserves  lapis  tickets on Orlandeau.Ive also noticed that Ive become beholden to the time constraints of the game. It kinda feels like a child or a second pet. Getting a couple of Orlandeaus will justify that timesink but if it doesnt happen going forward it doesnt really make sense. So...Drumroll please...EDIT I am doing my pulls live on my twitch stream if anyone is interested in watching me battle RNGsus!EDIT   tickes and   pulls  rainbows no Orlandeau  I got a second and third Lightning though.

11301972,0,t3_61autt,I personally think Orlandeaus myth was mostly a consequence of his extremely early release in JP. There when the Thunder God came out the other best physical damage dealers were... Luneth and Gilgamesh. That was all unless you want to count units like Lightning DK Cecil and Queen into the mix.When he came out in JP Orlandeau DESTROYED the entire meta. He was insanely overpowered compared to everyone else and he alone defined the future of the game and the following  bases just look at Aileen and Tidus.But in GL Gumi did an excellent job diluting the power creep leading to a perfect nonbroken release for Orlandeau. Olive is just as strong as him in terms of physical damage albeit in a different role as shes a finisher and we have received exclusive units and buffs to existing units that now make the Thunder God seem just... Right. Very strong but not gamebreaking like he was in JP.,FFBraveExvius,dfd28hg,29,t5_34n2x

If youre comparing s then its a bit better you need a bit more than  ATK so were right at that range now in global. So Poach would only be good for Firion when hes not your primary damage dealer and you have all your good TMs on someone else.  But it might be best in those cases to give him the raw ATK TMs and give the others poach. ,FFBraveExvius,dfdqqsf,1,t5_34n2x

11311236,0,t3_61dcce,Claic is actually one of the luckiest guys ever to pull on live stream Im the first to admit he got unlucky this time but for the past big banners gilga luneth noctis yun dk fina etc. He got every single one of those units in less then  multis and even before the gacha change I only saw him being trolled once and it was dark knight cecil hardly a troll. In fact this created the rumor Gumi was seeding his pulls to make people believe the rates were better and the he works for Gumi pun. Now if we consider this episode he pulled a rainbow for roughly each  pulls below average but hardly abismal. Ziss has had it worse time and time again and personally so have I and many other people that support the game. But RNG is RNG this time I got  Orlandus in less than  multis it was about time.

11335133,0,t1_dfgt0wr,Dualcast and Dualwield are kind of defining features for a DPS unit. Anything that can attack twice in one turn is clearly at an advantage over something that can only attack once unless youre Olive and youve made Doublehand viable.Lacking real power is not a big loss so long as youve got the sustainability to last as many turns as you need. Ifrit was a great example of this where I eschewed all damage in favor of sustainability. The fights took up to  minutes in my early runs but I had a team that could last the entire  minutes. That is the role Halve MP would fill. Dualwield gives a unit both damage and sustainability so Dualcast controls the damage portion for mages and Halve MP would focus exclusively on providing sustainability something most mages dont really have even with Osmose. If you want to use one the other or both then you can adjust your team accordingly.,FFBraveExvius,dfgtfx3,2,t5_34n2x

11361430,0,t3_623tb5,They both have their pros it all boils down to what your fighting really. as refia cant buff spr so shes basically only good against physical damage. so in the upcoming esper trial she wont be that good with all the AOE magical damage in terms of support buffing.overall unequipped yshtola is better due to innate MP regen and camouflage healer staying alive easier and able to heal longer is always nice and versitiliy. youd need to give refia  TMs DC soluna ring or similar and camouflage to make her equally as good. Where as yshtola only requires  ribbon to be even better then refia as refia could still be put to sleep or a few items.Embolden is nice for atk but all that amounts to is less time fighting which is nice sure but if your not able to survive a few extra turns with yshtola you more then likely wont be winning with refia either. refia is better at stabilizing a losing battle with full life if your characters can take the hits in the following turn. so she pulls ahead in that department slightly but if your not able to take the hits in the next turn it basically becomes mute.TMs obvious change things as does equipment Refia basically requires a TM to be on par with yshtola where as ysh only requires a few easy to get items to win if you give her a tm as well she becomes better with the only thing refia really bring to the table is stabilization when things go bad and quicker battle with embolden. ,FFBraveExvius,dfjsp8d,1,t5_34n2x

If you mean exclusive ones i dont know any specific ones but that didnt matter anyway because there were simply too much content.Similar for FF Mobius although it didnt need collabs so much since it had many unique explorations and battle tower events ie enough content of its own.FFRK and FF Mobius having a collab with each other was the icing on the cake. I only wish FFBE would do something like that.The point of gacha is to maximize profits therefore making sure that the whales pay for content. Just that Mobius way to do that was to make the exclusive classes unique since these are the eyecandies. You can still easily clear content with the base classes. You never needed Cloud or Tidus or we.Whereas in FFRK or FFBE the eyecandies are the weapons for FFRK and the  star units for FFBE.We are talking semantics here while Mobius is indeed the worst pw game FFRK or FFBE are really not that far behind  the curve.But we were talking about collabs not who has the best fp system and to my knowledge FFRK and Mobius had their fair share of them.

Most people who have been around for a while here know me and know how much thought and effort I put into the game.  I mean fuck Im the guy who wrote maybe the subreddits longest single post and it was on selling FP units.  What I posted above was not in any way shape or form a brag.  But the fact that we have people in this subreddit who react so poorly at anything they even think is the slightest form of pride they downvote it or try to say shit about it twisting the meaning is one of the bad things we do still have in this subreddit. The user uPMMeYoTitsGrrl and quite a lot of others are under the impression theres nothing you can do against the higher opponents. This is just plain false and my narrative was antidotal evidence to show that its not true there was a point to me saying it that wasnt to brag  Its an excuse people who dont put much thought into the arena use to make themselves feel better when what they need are some nice HPs.

This was when both espers alive no change oddly enough after.   They barely dropped me any summon orbs.  Through the entire fight I gained enough to summon once.

11579426,0,t3_656nej,uJackMikeson Thanks for the effort to bring up the Meta Ranking page on the FFBE Wiki. It definitely helps. However since you mentioned that you are FP it would probably help if you could invite some reputed dolphinswhales that are already doing unit reviews for the community to the Meta Ranking committee. These people have firsthand experience playing with advanced builds and have committed time and resources to do unit reviews anyway in addition to building up their own assets in the game. So they have aligned interest in making the Meta Ranking right for the community as well as for themselves. Examples of such people especially those that are already giving out examples of both newbie and advanced build recommendations for each unit they are reviewing areCraig Yuzolt  guidegamersdotcom Their insights should be helpful in making the Meta ranking and classification as useful as possible for the FFBE community ,FFBraveExvius,dg8j904,1,t5_34n2x

11598598,0,t3_64xhy9,Just thought I would give my  cents here who knows it may be helpful.My setup was Minfilia  with Siren her gear and materia from the event HP materia. Cecil  with Golem the helm that prevents confuse flamse shield HP materia Yshtola  with Diabolos her gear from the event Black Bandana to prevent Sleep Barfira and Barwatera materias. Noctis  with Ifrit Black Bandana to prevent Sleep Black choker to prevent confuse dont want him messing your units Bushido freedom. Friend Orlandeau  with Ifrit sleep and confusion imunitty a plus.The MVP here is Minfilia because of the essential elemental resistance. I used Yshtola instead of my Dualcast Refia because I needed Barfira and Barwatera for the very first turn and Refia was unable to help here.If you dont have Noctis a Ling takes his place just fine since most of the time Noctis will be breaking and restoring MP anyway. Noctis is just better because when his support is not required he can unleash hell along wih Orlandeau.Bring lots of items specially MP sleep and confuse recover. You want Osmose and Confuse to hit only Cecil but some of them will hit the party some times.Now there are just some essential things to remember for the fight. Do these and it will be actually easy. Surviving the very first tun is actually the hardest part of the battle. The bosses will rub the floor with your face if you are not careful. Follow these steps Minfilia cast Shadow Guard Cecil casts Focus Yshtola dual casts Barfira and Barwatera Noctis uses Bushido Freedom to dispel bot bosses Orlandeau breaks ATK from Ifrit. IMPORTANT never break Def from Ifrit. Do that and you wipe simple as that. Never use Noctis Warp Break in ifrit breaking Siren is fine. Survived the first turn with all alive? Good! Focus on killing Ifrit first. Now Minfilia will cycle Shadow Fire and Water guards for the rest of the fight. Always make sure you use the right Guard. Cecil now keeps Provoke up you dont want Sirens Osmose and Confuse to keep out of check. Yshtola is free to heal freely and use Protectga and Shellga as needed. Noctis and Orlandeau can do damage. Keep Noctiss Cover up to help with MP usage. NEVER EVER push more than a threshold at once. When you pass a threshold first use Cecil to Dispel the boss AND then use Noctis to break Ifrit ATK. Dont do damage at all unless it is the last threshold Defend with Orlandeau if you have to. After Ifrit dies the fight becomes much easier. Siren can be broken at will meaning she will go down faster. Dont lose the pace and you win!,FFBraveExvius,dgapk3s,2,t5_34n2x
11598651,0,t1_dganoz3,Do you even know what is the problem here? It is that you and me and everybody is forced to use a feature to play this game if you dont want to lose your progress when exchanging devices JP has a perfect way to deal with this and Gumi decided to reinvent the wheel on a way most of us find stupid. Im not the only one going through this and will now be the last one and a big part of the community that play this game has made a fb account just to play this game most of us I do believe you too play this game because of nostalgia not because its an awesome game if this game didnt had what it has no need to be too specific with this part certainly would not last long enough to Gumi truly profit on it mostly because I hear left and right this game looks an plays way too much like Brave Frontier even though I dont know the game so go to a new game when theres another that you already know thats pretty much the same and maybe you have a better account on the older one?,FFBraveExvius,dgaprw9,1,t5_34n2x

11600420,0,t3_64xhy9,Dint get greatsword mastery but i finally cleared after  tries. Minfilia  diabolos hp equip. Main job was rotating barga spellsCecil  golem . keep provoke up so siren only osmose Cecil and as mp item userRefia  siren dc healer you can swap her for yshtola Ling  ifrit atk break mp rec and revive Friend bis olivemade the job much easier  true shot ifrit to death. On siren break def n lighting resist then continue to true shot. Olive died the most but thts fine bec he shot a new mortar everytime he revived. Many people talk about bringing xon but for me he was a wasted slot and ling did way better. Xon is for otko. He was pretty useless for a long run. Yshtola would help surviving the st rounddont hv her so i used Refia but once minfilia got her barga set up it was safe sailing. dont bring carbuncle for the bar spells. Yes i did and i died Cecil should always hv his provoke up to avoid osmose on other characters. Ling mp rec helped a lot there. For a friend id say bring a strong single target dps olive is great there. Concentrate on killing ifrit st then siren. Remember to dispel when needed.

11685629,0,t1_dgk9irv,While sure some things do come earlier it doesnt automatically make it better. Enhancements were quite shit tbh nothing worth actually enhancing.    The gacha change I guess was inevitable. How much sooner did we even get it? Also dont forget that they screwed us over with the Zidane banner just to milk people on money.    Summon change Im not that into. Its basically nothing they lose money over so its not something they needed to hold back. It changes very little. You might have a slightly easier time to complete some missions but thats it.    GL exclusives are well met true but its also built on a lot of hype and then dies down once the release actually happens. Few GL exclusives stay relevant like Ling for example.    Now sure we might be getting stuff earlier again I have no idea how much earlier but I feel like its just to cover for the bad stuff.,FFBraveExvius,dgkl0nm,0,t5_34n2x

It may not be much excitement but it helps me at least.  Increasing the spawn rate would be great though because itd give more hope to the playerbase even at the cost of slightly lowering the currency drop rate of the bonus monsters.Maybe have the monster appear after  runs without it.  Keeps the RNG factor that makes Gumi money but doesnt alienate the playerbase by having them chase a carrot that they may not ever get for no reason other than randomness rainbows are another topic.

11691821,0,t3_66s8iw,My only gripe is that I wish the bonus spawns dropped stuff other than event currency enhancement mats stat pots  trust mooglesteam or specific  lapis etc...From their side of things it makes it much easier to balance event currency in a way that is perceived fairly by the playerbase.  One of the hardest things about being on the business side of the videogame industry is providing benefits that are seen by the playerbase.

11692708,0,t3_66tixq,gt Even at lower ranks macroing is still a much better value then pulling for units. It is a safebet to spend your lapis on refills. The refill macro is  safe to use. It has never and most likely will never eat yours or anyone elses lapis.  this is what people should take away from this post.  the common thread on this sub is to hoard all the lapis you can to pull for a specific banner.  even if you get the unit youre looking for they arent much use without the right equipment and materia.  theres new units and TMRs to get every  weeks.  if it takes you over a month to farm them you are never really going to get anywhere.  if you are really interested in using your resources to their maximum efficiency your would use at least some of your lapis on refilling on TMR farming.,FFBraveExvius,dgldxji,1,t5_34n2x

11728718,0,t1_dgpa0pu,Where did I say literally impossible in there? My point is closer to noticeably suboptimal or rarely practical if you want to sum it up.Simply put I just think WoL is better off stacking HP or SPR than he is using a slot for Curaja or DW in any particular situation. The majority of high end healers either can Dualcast Curaja or have abilities that already heal sufficiently like Tilith.Indiscriminate in my usage was referring to rolling several Breaks into one which Full Break does more than his Erasers obviously.Break Resist has been added for Global fights but the only fight in which breaking is important and it was added was Ifrit raid. Thats more an unpopular anomaly than any indicator of a trend. There has been exactly one time where DW would be helpful to stick a break and no forthcoming fights in which that would be worth considering if we reasonably assume Break resist is staying out of breaksusceptible trials. DW might have use for Staves to tank Magic heavy trials but the appeal is not for landing breaks as I can see.As for Curaja it stems from his AoE Cover.  mitigation while covering the full party means he essentially takes  the net damage for everyone. The thing is if hes covering Magic in that turn he heals a significant portion of that off already with his counter and having higher HP means he heals off more since thats a  of his max. For WoL to use Curaja your team would need to barely survive the attacks go through the Healers turn and still be missing a  HP apiece which between Ramza Ayaka Tilith and Rikku as restoreReraise options is an extremely uncommon scenario one way or another.,FFBraveExvius,dgphbga,3,t5_34n2x
