4262374,0,t1_cs62fds,Odd Im a mod and can clearly see mod messages older than  months.  I was able to see back  years before I stopped scrolling.One of the admins you mentioned is no longer an admin and the other has clearly stated even recently that they dont get involved in the direction or leadership of subs.,videos_discussion,cs636dq,-1,t5_33bzd
5064645,0,t1_cuw1xe0,Then well be accused of being in it for the karma however ridiculous that may be especially on a shared mod account. Its also a lot of maintenance  work to do that and theres no guarantee that it would get attention not necessarily a con but not a plus either.,videos_discussion,cuwhcox,2,t5_33bzd
5254625,0,t1_cuvpnr8,gtDelete the bad video link and put up one for the originalA bot could do this. Call it Not stolen bot. Links to the original video posts a screencap of the original thread. It also reaps all the stolen karma.,videos_discussion,cvjdchq,1,t5_33bzd

5685296,0,t3_3swu4c,You know whats funny? Its rvideos not ranythingbutpolitics. The fact that the mods of the sub take a dumb video forum so seriously that they have to ban content they personally disagree with is laughable.,videos_discussion,cx1tdvu,42,t5_33bzd

5711117,0,t1_cx4y5jw,gtPeople shouldnt have to articulately defend themselves in order to prevent mods from pushing through unpopular changes.I agree I dont expect everyone to argue articulately or produce massive essays to shoot down every facet of what Im saying but I do expect them to make some salient points which take into consideration that moderators have a necessarily different more objective view of the subreddit than they do. Simply inasmuch as having far more data at our disposal about whats being posted whats being removed whats causing issues etc.gtInstead of you saying oh the userbase are a bunch of idiots we dont listen to them you should instead say wow it looks like we have really hit a nerve here.Mmm but we knew this would be unpopular because we have seen a good year or so of socialpolitics hitting the frontpage. Most notably the antiblack stuff during the race riots a few months ago that would be on the frontpage every day then loads of antifeminism stuff then some profeminism stuff in return both of which lead to the same kind of flamewars in comments and most recently the Southparkinspired safe spaces conversation.We know these are popular and we also knew that they were spirit of the rule violations of Rule . That meant that the rule needed addressing or it was pointless to have in place at all.gtYou keep referring to this secret information... why not describe that information or better yet make it public?Theres no one document I have which constitutes a casefile of all the reasons R should exist. It comes from being a moderator getting to know the community and seeing the content which is submitted which is removed which causes the most problems and which best aligns with whatever the vision for rvideos happens to be. As a very genericallytitled subreddit our vision is fairly straightforward variety and quality. Rule  absolutely empirically and positively impacts both of those things.,videos_discussion,cx50pxq,-5,t5_33bzd
5796392,0,t3_3suljz,If reddit worked backwards. You could have this subreddit be the hub for many subreddits that link together as the main one not just rvideosrpoliticalvideos because thats annoying. Then say that someone whos not logged in wouldnt see some of the more risque subsubreddits of the mods choice and others who are logged in could select or deselect the subsubreddits they didnt want in their main subreddit. Then you wouldnt have to do all this extra work. there would be rpoliciticalvideos rfunnyvideos rworldstarvideos whatever that would be an option to see in the main sub under rvideos. Some would be defaults and some could be turned off or on as the individual user saw fit.,videos_discussion,cxfli26,1,t5_33bzd

11528946,0,t1_dg2sq0v,They implemented the rules because people starting doxxing and tracking down the personal information of police officers. Do you honestly think the reddit hivemind isnt currently trying to do the exact same thing to the air marshal involved?,videos_discussion,dg2t3it,60,t5_33bzd
11529271,0,t3_64jkp0,Yeah Id like to know this as well.The only thing that rule does is help keep important events hdden from the public eye.It causes outrage which is one of the only tools at the publics disposal to get actual change through. Outrage fuels commitment.,videos_discussion,dg2ufak,2,t5_33bzd
11531886,0,t3_64jgcy,So than why does CNN and every other major news source feel OK showing the video? And why am I yet again forced to go somewhere else to learn about one of the biggest stories of today? Ban users that DOXX or threaten or support DOXXing. Crushing a video that reddit thinks is important right as it might reach top posts and youre saying its silly they would think someone got paid to remove it? This seems to happen regularly. If it is the top post change the title put a sticky but dont completely remove it and cut off all the steam. Because dont act like it wouldnt be one of the top posts of all time of you hadnt done that. And lookin at the  other videos that dont fully explain the situation is annoying as fuck. If a real alternative to reddit comes along shit like this is going to make people leave.,videos_discussion,dg353l6,6,t5_33bzd
