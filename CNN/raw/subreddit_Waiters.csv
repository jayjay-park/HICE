5495272,0,t1_cwdyraw,While appreciate the movement as a former waiter and current owner I do have some questions about your stated goalsa All employees will be compensated with ONE FAIR WAGE.    What is a fair wage?  Should BOH and FOH be paid the same amount? For the record I believe BOH is severely underpaid in most establishments.  Should FOH employees receive tips?  Should BOH get a share of those tips?b All shall receive regular and dignified raises.    What designates a raise as being dignified?   an hour to full time employees means a raise of over K a year.  Is a dollarhour raise dignified? c All shall have paid sick time noone will be forced for economic reasons to work sick.    How will sick time be determined?  I agree that employees should be able to earn paid sick leave and have that in my restaurant.  Should it be based on hours worked?  Pay periods?d If the company asks that we spend time away from our families on holidays that sacrifice will be recognized and compensated with double time pay.    Federal guidelines declare that extra pay for working holidays is not required.  I m not saying I agree with this policy but that is federal law.  On top of that what do you consider holidays?  Obviously things like Christmas and Thanksgiving come to mind but are you also talking about Valentines Day?  Memorial Day?  Labor Day?e All who want full time work shall have it.  Hours will be given to those seeking more hours before hiring new staff.    I agree with this one wholeheartedly.  A multinational company should put the needs of their moredevoted staff ahead of those who see it just another paycheck.f Employer will provide health insurance to all workers.    Employers the size of Darden have the legal right to provide health insurance to every employee or pay a penalty for not doing so.  I am not saying that this is the right way to go about it but it IS their right to do as they see fitg Benefit incentive programs are not just for management but for all workers.    The phrasing here is incredibly unclear.  What are benefit incentive programs?Now before you start sharpening your pitchforks I want to make it clear that I have spent over a decade in the industry working both tipped and untipped positions and I have held these same beliefs.  I just want to make it clear that there are more aspects to this scenario than might meet the eye.If everything in a restaurant is running perfectly no waste theft unforeseen loss and cost percentages are at the industry average then restaurants make an average profit of five cents on the dollar for everything sold.  This is assuming that the restaurant is paying the industry standard tipcredit wage for FOH employees.So if a restaurant like Chilis which is part of the Darden family and a place where I have worked has an average gross revenue of  million per year per site that means that there is an average profit per site of K.  The restaurant I worked at had about  employees both FOH and BOH which would mean a redistribution of K per employee per year.  If everyone working there was at fulltime this would equate to roughly a .hr raise.  Does this meet your demands?Like I stated above I have worked in the positions you listed at the heading of your site and am now in the position where I can offer some but not all of the benefits that you have asked for.  I believe that things can and should be done to make it so employees dont have to worry about what the weather is going to be like in regard to the money they will make.  I just want you to know about the many different layers that have to be considered when making demands like this.,Waiters,cwe2n1n,1,t5_2sq42
