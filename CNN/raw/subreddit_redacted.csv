10602781,0,t1_dd9f13v,The left is people like Obama who refuses to denounce this kind of behavior. The left is people like George Soros who bankrolls these protests and pays people to protest. Have you heard one peep out of Hillary saying something along the lines of Hey quit it the election is over.? The left loves this kind of stuff because they all went to Woodstock and had their day in the sun with protesting only now the peaceful demonstrations arent working so they have to double down and get violence into the equation. ,redacted,dd9lgso,9,t5_2rgii

10680297,0,t1_ddhd4wa,gt Please give me anyone with real credentials denying the fact. Dr John Bates A lead NOAA scientist.gtWhat is C? Are you saying Carbon Dioxide? Yes it is a problem but it is not THE problem. See you saying  of scientists disagree with you is exactly what Im talking about. Because they do not Carbon dioxide is not the only factor.Yes carbon dioxide. Most global warming indicates its carbon dioxide. Per your own cause...  of warming is due to carbon dioxide  THE MAIN CAUSE.gtThere are far more reasons things are bigger in prehistoric times specifically insects not dinosaurs and the popular theory is that there was MORE OXYGEN in the atmosphere.Maybe is Oxygen  I have seen some studies say Carbon Dioxide plants get big  herbivores eat plants  carnivores eat herbivores  everything gets huge. I have seen one study say Oxygen  that only relates to insects first result in Google  prob same one you searched for. Can you explain a bit how Oxygen works in the process of large growth? I cant find many popular studies out there. Just one.gtDoes he now? Because it looks like you completely made that up. And are you telling me a day and a half is a substantial amount of time to fully understand a large subject? Or are you people actually arrogant enough to pretend its that easy.If looking at NOAA curated data takes longer than a day or two  you have a slow brain. It probably took years of hard work to compile analyze and plan the data sets harder even to get the hardware into the field. Expensive too. However NOAA compiled that data for us to see. It took me about  hours to review the data  read the research and to know the data was wrong. Hell everyone does now.gtBecause I think he himself even admitted I may have been inaccurate and has since backpedaled.Prove that statement.gtSo how come no professionals in the subject agree with you? Or do you scoff at the fact there are actually people out there that hold more knowledge to subjects you do?I believe most do. Can you substantiate the studyclaim that concluded  of scientists think global warming is happening? You seem to cling to this belief  hence why no one agrees with me. How do you know nobody agrees with me? Or if they all agree with you? Who have you asked?gtYes this is what happens when you warm warmer air. Good god. High school science called they want you back.They want your insults back too gtTo explain warming and cooling periods happen over hundreds of years not a month so no El Nino means nothing because its just a blip.Ok... but drastic spikes etc... gtTo put it in really simple terms lets say every cycle of about  years it gets warmer. So for example over the course of  years every  years it gets cooler and every other  years gets warmer. But that changes every cycle. So now where every cycle its increasing slowly with the population boom every warm cycle is much warmer than its supposed to be. You saying But its so cold in January doesnt mean its not occuring thats just being really goddamn short sighted.Huh? You seem to put words in my mouth and make a bad analogy.gt...What? Everywhere? Exactly what specific piece of data are you trying to contradict? Give me one otherwise you cant say where is it because apparently none of the papers count? Congrats you decided to cherry pick ONE man though that has zero credibility on the subject I bet youre real proud of that.Links above.I am happy to have a thoughtful discussion. But your wit and data is bad. I am beginning to think the thing that analyzes the data your brain is fried too.There are three kinds of people in the world. Those can create meaning from nothing. Those that can understand meaning when taught. And those who cannot understand meaning when taught.... where do you lay on that spectrum?,redacted,ddhlb88,1,t5_2rgii

10844275,0,t1_ddyh3t9,Oh yeah thatll do the trick. Maybe what we need is a public school system which does something other than drill standardized tests into kids heads until they graduate. And maybe we could reduce hours kids spend in class and emphasize doing actual work outside of class so they arent sitting in class  hoursday understimulated and not paying attention.And maybe just maybe we could offer public school teachers an attractive salary so our pupils are being taught by the best and brightest in the country.Countries like Japan and Norway have very different education systems from each other yet both put up much higher test scores than us. The thing that they have and we dont is respect for public school teachers. Too bad Betsy DeVos master plan is to defund public schools.,redacted,ddyie9x,8,t5_2rgii
10888777,0,t1_de2huf0,Heres the thing even with federal funding parents in lowincome or even mediumincome households still cant afford to send their children to private schools. The average tuition for a private elementary school is  while a private high school is . Parents who cant afford to shovel away  per kid over a  year time span are thrown under the bus.And we cant just throw every public school student into a charter school for the logistical reasons I mentioned above. Your opening statement is a hell of a claim and is full of errors even if it did hold true. Charter schools have admissions offices which are picky about what kids to take in. Even if it was proven that charter schools produce better students this would not hold if charter schools were forced to cater to every student in the country.gtThis incentivizes people to provide quality education for profits.I dont believe so. Look to other forprofit industries and you see that the  priority for these institutions is unsurprisingly profit. With publiclyfunded industries the bottom line is performance because better performance gets you better funding.Heres what I imagine your free market utopia looking like the best and brightest kids probably not my kids and probably not your kids go to private schools and the most elitist and selective charter schools. The middleground fight to get into any decent school and this school prioritizes profit over education so theyre even worse off than the public schools you attended. The rejects those with learning disabilities mental health issues behavioral issues bad families poor socioeconomic backgrounds heavy exposure to drugs and alcohol and so on either dont qualify into a school or get thrown into a child mill which doesnt give them the resources they need to thrive. ,redacted,de33ltp,2,t5_2rgii
