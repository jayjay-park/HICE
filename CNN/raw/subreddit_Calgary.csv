No matter how good a server is there will always be dine and dashes if someone comes into the restaurantbar with the intent to eat for free they will do it no amount of effort from any staff will prevent this entirely except possibly having a large amount of door staff something outside the servers control that would no doubt cost the restaurant more money then they would save.You seem very concerned about the well being of the business financially and are against government involvement why? If the owner were to demand his managers start stealing milk from Safeway so that he could save money on costs would you support that as well? Its the exact same thing the owner performing illegal actions in order to save money why is it ok for him to steal from me when I doubt you would be fine with him stealing from other businesses.Finally you act as if Im pathetic for worrying about loosing a no skilled job?

But the people I were with had blinders on for the big taste menu and the price and great deal didnt even really consider the rest of the menu.I ordered whatever I wanted not big taste menu and paid a few bucks more and enjoyed my meal more than the people who were disappointed with their big taste meal.My philosophy is that you go to a good restaurant for the FOOD not for the DEAL.

Right now its this little stub that is only useful to people coming off the bow pathway into downtown.

Slow down for sure and keep an eye on your surroundings but DONT STOP! If youre out of the way then thats all we need. If you stop then some yahoo is going to rearend you or even if that doesnt happen once Im passed youre now on the deerfoot at kph and surrounded by other vehicles zooming passed you  not fun.While Im at it dont pull over and keep driving on the right shoulder as youre now throwing up dust and stones from that unused lane.  amp  A tricky one that I had just the other day was driving hot southbound on a busy deerfoot but I needed to take the next exit. Im in the left lane but its all busy to my right. So rather than cause panic I killed my flashing lights and indicated right.

There was vocal opposition to the Alberta Childrens Hospital over traffic when it was being built and people who complained over the colours they chose too...sheesh! and honestly thats not turned out to be a problem either. The school has a capacity of  students so even if each child has their own assistant youre still only looking at  plus maybe  staff. School hours for Christine Meikle are  to  daily  The worst of rush hour around here seems to be earlier in the morning its already pretty busy by  and around  in the afternoon with people commuting to downtown. You get another small rush around  and  as hospital staff come off shift but traffic in the area has been steady for years without major problems. It gets awful just before Christmas with the mall but even then its not like youre stuff for thirty minutes at the lights.

They believe that by using graphic and what should be private medical images along with emotional appeals and inaccurate information they will provoke disgust and terror in children at a young age who will then subliminally retain that initial fearful reaction even into adulthood when their comprehension and reasoning skills have improved. And as a parent they know you will do your best to avoid discussing it and answering questions thus creating an even greater mystique of fear around the subject. I dont know what the best way to respond is I dont have kids if I did and they saw this though I would probably just tell them that these are bad people trying to scare them into thinking a certain way about an adult issue that is very complicated and that when they grow up they will be able to learn more and make their own decisions about it...i guess it depends what your personal beliefs are though.,Calgary,cjbdvki,10,t5_2qn40

1719281,0,t3_2e4407,In theory if they are paying market rates for a unit that should be generating a decent return for Cgy Housing to then turn around and build more units ... in theory. Reality doesnt work that way however as CH probably doesnt keep the money itself. And the article does not say what rate they are paying. I suspect less than the true market. units isnt many but the optics are horrible. Yet these people are there based on an old policy so its not like they are breaking the rules  the rules changed on them.Personally I have no problem with this. I dont think the government should really be in the housing business at all. I much prefer the model the Mustard Seed and the Drop In and others use where they get some cash to help out and then work with the poor the homeless to find them a market place get in and start to get their lives in order. Rarely does giving a unit to someone with no other support in place work. That is why many are chronically at risk.Granted if I was a landlord I would probably be wary of this. But that is why homelessness is such a pervasive problem with no easy solutions.And of course Dear Leader Jack Happy Ending Layton lived in exactly this arrangement in Toronto when he was a councilor there.

2775015,0,t3_2rttrb,Jason Van Rassel should spend an evening rush hour observing pedestrians in an intersection like st Avenue and st St SW by Chinook station then tell me its not the pedestrians.The simple fact is it is both.  One might quibble over the exact percentages but neither side owns a clear majority of the fault imnsho.Both sides suffer from the same problem  tunnel vision.  Too many drivers zone out and fail to see the pedestrians in their peripheral vision because they have completely forgotten the concept of active scanning.  Same reason why it took well over a year for people to start realizing that the old yield from the Deerfoot exit to Heritage is now a free flow.  They assumed it was a yield failed to see and understand the sign and stopped unnecessarily.Pedestrians are just as foolish in this regard.  Especially as others have noted with the idea that they can simply rush through a crosswalk because it is a crosswalk.  Smartphones make this problem so much worse too.  The number of times I have seen someone cross without even glancing up from their phones is crazy.  Sometimes even pushing baby strollers.  Both sides are just as impatient too.  Drivers need to both learn to stop at the stop line  getting those extra four feet by stopping in the crosswalk wont save you time  and they need to see the pedestrians who have the right of way when turning right.    But pedestrians need to realize that the greenyellowred lights mean absolutely nothing to them.  You dont start to cross because the light is green.  You start to cross when the pedestrian signal says walk.  If it says dont cross dont cross.,Calgary,cnjibld,13,t5_2qn40

3134749,0,t3_2w21kq,My favourite view within the city limits is in the northwest go to Nose Hill Park park at any of its many parking lots and walk up one of the trails for a bit. I love Nose Hill its a real gem in the city.There are some other good options within the southwest though. Go to the end of the west LRT at th St and go to the top of the Park and ride parkade. Or just south of there go to Signal HillBatallion Park. There are stairs from the residential neighborhood at the top of the hill to the Westhills shopping mall at the bottom. Or head up to the top of the slopes at COP I guess thats technically northwest? Not sure you can get there from Cougar RidgeJust a few suggestions. Not sure why youd need to go all the way to Barlow to see them. That seems like the opposite direction from where youd want to be. Theyre actually much closer to the southwest side of the city. On second though I suppose that could actually be the problem the further west you get the bigger the foothills become and the easier it is to get into a valley where you cant see much of the mountains at all. But when you know the right places to go the southwest corner of the city is where you want to be for mountain views.You have to kind of avoid pure residential areas for the most part  basically if a house can be built with a view you better goddamn believe they are going to build a house with a view. You arent going to see any mountains just walls of houses. Parks are generally your best bet but even those are typically placed in the least view places possible in order to maximize the number of houses with a view.Honestly if youre willing to drive even a few minutes past city limits youll usually get much better views. Yes its technically outside the city but if you head west for a bit along any of the semimajor routes like Glenmore th Ave or Old Banff CoachSpringbank Rd suddenly most of the tightly packed walls of houses disappear and its much easier to find a sideroad to pull off onto to enjoy the view. As the saying goes Go west young man go west.,Calgary,comwwus,13,t5_2qn40

3164058,0,t1_copxh5u,Having friends who have done this although not with kids so that case isnt quite the same but for them its the price. If you look at a similar home close to downtown the price isnt even close to a first time homeowners price. So they buy way south or west bowtrail but the city cant keep up with infrastructure like schools and public transit Calgary has needed a couple high schools more since I graduated  or  years ago this isnt recent. Then they decide to have families and realize that the elementary that was promised by  isnt even started yet. As someone who works and continues to study in the construction industry I can tell you there are a ton of open promises that are never kept. Unless you sign a contract with specific wording in it dont expect it with obvious exceptions for those of you who also work in the industry. Fortunately non of my friends in that situation have started families yet because of grad school or other reasons but I could have definitely seen them making that mistake in their younger first homebuyer years. Everyone makes mistakes and unfortunately a lot of real estate agents try and secure the sale instead of helping the first time buyer.

Im not going to compare to Mexico or New York or Honk Kong those cities are different enough from here that the comparison doesnt work. But Ive driven in Vancouver Toronto Seattle and Portland as well as Calgary. The thing that strikes me here is that people are much more aggressive and more likely to forget traffic rules when it suits them  and theyre more likely to take a stance of exceptionalism about it if you ask them about it. I needed to make that exit and there isnt a lot of traffic its fine to cut across three lanes if Im safe about it. Oh but look at this idiot he didnt signal! What a moron if he tries to change into my lane Im going to cut him off to teach him a lesson you cant just drive like that!One thing I never understand As a pedestrian Ive been nearly bit by cars dozens of times and then had that driver stop their car to yell at me for crossing the road. Ive had drivers speed up to get by me in a marked crosswalk and then flip me off as they go by or honk at me for not walking across fast enough for them.Last night I was crossing at a way stop. When I was in the middle of the road a driver went straight through the stop sign and veered onto the sidewalk to miss me then rolled down his window to inform me that I was a stupid bitch. At a residential intersection. At a stop sign.A few years back a driver got into her car in an empty parking lot. She immediately gunned it backwards and pulled a hard  degree turn without looking behind her. She backed straight into me and my friend. When we yelled and put our hands up to block the car she got out and tried to pick a fight with us. What a couple of retards we were not looking where we were going and walking in the middle of the road. We were lucky she didnt call the police for hitting her car. sighI dont know what it is about this place.,Calgary,corkrq1,3,t5_2qn40

3373307,0,t3_2ysfwe,There seems to be two kinds of people. The kind that buy a house cause they want to live in it and love it and people that are obsessed with the value of their house.  My girlfriend works in new home sales for a local builder and has gone through quite a few peaks and lows in the market. Everyone considers themselves an expert in real estate for some reason. The fact of the matter is there hasnt been a complete crater in the housing market since the s nor will there be. If you love the house and plan on living in it for the foreseeable future then you have very low risk of losing money. Yes a lot of people made a lot of equity in their homes over the last year or few years some people havent. Its called a market for a reason.  Theres a certain level of unpredictability as evidenced by the people that keep saying were doomed and values havent gone down much. Some homes gain equity quicker than others there are many many things that dictate this. If your primary concern is your house gaining in value quickly then your realtor should be able to direct you to areas and communities that have higher values. You will also pay more to get into those.  I speak as someone that has both lost on properties and gained equity and you simply cannot guarantee that your house will gain value at a certain rate. So you should go with a house you love. If you would like help or to speak with someone that can help explain market fluctuations and trends better than I can suggest some great Realtors and my girlfriend is considered one of the best sales persons for new home sales in the business. Im not trying to brag its a simple fact. Ive gone through builds and ive gone through Realtors and she is simply one of the best Ive seen. ,Calgary,cpcs5mf,2,t5_2qn40

Some of those numbers can be legitimate local phone numbers that have nothing to do with the scam call.The telephone company does know the real source of the call to you although it may not be able to determine the actual source of the call if it was relayed through a compromised PBX.

I would take a bus from my house to SomerestBridlewood station take the train downtown transfer downtown and then take a bus from the station at Sunridge to my actual place of work  unless I just missed it in which case I would walk the  minutes in lieu of waiting half an hour for the next one.  When it was below  degrees I hated my life.  I bought a car as soon as I could and neither the North Center or SE lines would have helped me.  Im jealous of cities that have the population to sustain real subway systems where you can be heated because in Calgary freezing your ass off and your half hour car journey taking  hours are two good reasons not to want to take transit.  It really pisses me off when people say well you chose to live there .  You are right I did because I was a student living off next to nothing and its what I could afford.  I took the job I could get when I graduated  sue me for not holding out for something closer to home or not up and moving when I didnt know how the job would pan out.  Now I work by the airport and sorry but transit sucks up there too and I dont want to live in the NE.  I dont really care if they choose to invest in transit rather than roads but the amount of improvement needed for a lot of people to decide this is a reasonable choice is grossly underestimated.

My dentist tried sending me to a sleep clinic in the SE off of Mcleod Trail and they want  up front just for the overnight sleep test. My dentist who clearly isnt a sleep specialist also recommended that I get a snoring appliance so I got the Somnomed. What a waste of money that was... It made my sleeping worse cause I had to sleep all night grinding the top and bottom of my teeth and it didnt even stop the snoring. Another option too was surgery where the break the jaw and move the bottom jaw forward. The thing about that is there was no guarantee that it would stop my snoring.

3647563,0,t1_cq81ri8,ampampamp Celebrity worship syndrome sfw gtgtCelebrity worship syndrome is an obsessiveaddictive disorder in which a person becomes overly involved with the details of a celebritys personal life. Psychologists have indicated that though many people obsess over glamorous film television sport and pop stars the only common factor between them is that they are all figures in the public eye. The term Celebrity Worship Syndrome is in fact a misnomer.gtThe term celebrity worship syndrome CWS first appeared in an article Do you worship the celebs? by James Chapman in the Daily Mail in  Chapman .   James Chapman was basing his article on the journal paper Maltby et al. . James Chapman refers to CWS but in fact this is a misunderstanding of a term used in the academic article to which he refers Maltby et al.  CWS which stood for Celebrity Worship Scale. Nonetheless Chapman may be generally correct. A syndrome refers to a set of abnormal or unusual set of symptoms indicating the existence of an undesirable condition or quality. Indeed many attitudes and behaviours covered in this research indicate such states. gtPsychologists in the United States and United Kingdom created a celebrity worship scale to rate the problems. In  United States psychologists Lynn McCutcheon Rense Lange and James Houran introduced the Celebrity Attitude Scale a  item scale administered to  persons living in central Florida.  McCutcheon et al. suggested that celebrity worship comprised one dimension in which lower scores on the scale involved individualistic behavior such as watching listening to reading and learning about celebrities whilst the higher levels of worship are characterized by empathy overidentification and obsession with the celebrity.gtInteresting Celebrity | Fan person | Teen idol Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqsec oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecqsec.

Crowchild rush hour haunts me and sure lots of times I get a nice driver who gives me a gap to go inspeeds up to let me go behind them but a large majority of the time even if i match highway speed at the end merging into traffic is so scary because the driver behind me doesnt give me a big enough gap or the car in front goes too slow. I feel like I just need more practice but obviously not at the expense of my car safety the car of someone else or their safety. So I guess Im looking for a low traffic merge area so practice on every day or something until I get more comfortable with higher traffic areas. I get really scared on places like Crowchild and stuff.Thanks!!,Calgary,cqgyuxi,2,t5_2qn40

Youre going to teach me about Keynesian economics?Since youre such an expert you do understand that under a true Keynesian system spending is supposed to be REDUCED when the economy supposedly improves after the government stimulus program ends correct?  Not reduced in the sense that were just not going to increase spending this year or were going to cut the rate at which we increase spending but an actual legitimate DECREASE IN SPENDING EQUIVALENT TO THE AMOUNT THAT SPENDING WAS INCREASED.You cant just spend a lot more than you have for a few years and than a little bit more than you have forever.

3807159,0,t1_cqpx9ki,I get what you are saying however I feel like its important to have both a responsive site and an app.  For one as utrymeonforsighs points out you cant push messages to users on a site once it closed.  Sure you hate push notifications but for some they might like them and know how to adjust the settings so they dont clog up screens etc.  The other benefit I can see to having a native app would be to keep it on the users phone.  Very few people know how to bookmark a site as an app icon therefore if Im a company Im going to provide a product so my user sees my company as much as possible.If responsive websites were the answer to native app design then Facebook and Google wouldnt have native apps.

Thus most people will forget some of them and not make it an issue. A few people will speak up but it wont create enough noise to make anything happen.Also some may argue that some of these things arent officially known as taxes so when they say taxes they may really mean just the income tax plus the health levy since its so prominent. With the drop in oil revenue its a given that new revenue has to come from somewhere along with spending cuts coming from somewhere. Taking tax increases of all kinds out of the picture means the balance will come from spending cuts probably in places that most of us dont like.

3937311,1,t1_cr52rhe,As should be clear from all of my previous posts to this thread I have no intention of politicizing this issue nor do I want to draw and quarter the NDP. As I clearly stated I voted for the NDP  for change and against the mismanagement of the PC. Do your homework before you throw around attack the man logic.Put up? I can offer the followingFirstly private sector employment is on the decline in Alberta under our shrinking economy brought about largely by the ripple effects of declining oil prices. In such times where unprotected private sector workers are being laid off without recourse it is reasonable to either rationalize some public sector workers or to impose compensation reductions or at least freezes. Any organization can find  cost reductions through efficiency and prioritization this would result in up to . billion in savings via health and education alone.Second this is not a onceinageneration oil price collapse it has occurred twice in the last  years. Last change will only be achieved by reducing our reliance on nonrenewable resource revenues  which the NDP proposes. Given this their multiyear budget should not account for this unpredictable source of revenue  yet it relies upon the same forcasts used by the PCs.Third there is no evidence that balancing a budget  by whatever combination of reduced expenditure and increased revenue tax  would be a disaster. Many jurisdictions in Canada and worldwide have balancedbudget laws  yet boast sustainable flexible economies.Fourth intelligent factbased criticism of government platformspolicy be it the PCs or the NDPs or whomever is not poisonous. It is our obligation as participants in a democracy.I dont accept that severe gt deficit spending is an unavoidable reality  as you do. I think that responsible government can do better.,Calgary,cr536gh,3,t5_2qn40

4036361,0,t1_crg4kdb,So lets see now. Your citation is from an opinion piece from a newspaper which quotes an economist who was hired by the chamber of commerce. I cant see any reason to take this opinion piece with a grain of salt.Now the chamber of commerce is always against increases to minimum wage because of course they hate the idea of having to pay higher wages and the idea that they will have to accept lower profits in order that their employees can eat without the food bank. So that kind of calls this piece of fluff sorry but citation is just not really the right word into pretty serious question.Then you come out with some paragraphs implying that somehow despite all those huge numbers of new secondary suites new rental apartment buildings new investment condos and new homes being built in our city the fact that rents have been dropping for over a nine months Ive been considering a move and keeping an eye on them that somehow competitive pressures will fail utterly and all the thousands of landlords in the city will collude to fix prices higher. That seems a little far fetched to me.Then you close with the Seattle thing another fluff piece written by a hack in which it is proposed that minimum wage will go up because people will be migrating to Seattle because they can earn more money at minimum wage. The journalist writing the hit piece quotes the economist a fellow at UW by cherry picking a single quote from this paperThe paper is actually extremely supportive of minimum wage increase as you will find when you read the  pages of context surrounding the single cherrypicked quote taken grievously out of context. But then the fact is that since the paper investigates the imposition of a civic minimum wage to a small urban area swimming in a vast sea of lower waged suburbs with cheaper rent rather than a provincewide minimum wage in an economic region characterized by high cost of living across the majority of the area. One can compare apples to oranges as you are trying to do here but the results are not useful.In addition one should note that in study after study after study all of which have been cited in various threads in the Calgary and Alberta subreddits findings are that while increases to the minimum wage can cause increases in the price of goods and services these increases are invariably much much smaller than the accompanying rise in purchasing power for those at lower incomes. One should further note that all of seminal work in this field shows that increases to unemployment are small and that they affect mainly part time workers and high school kids. Now while I have a certain amount of sympathy for a  year old who will take longer to buy a pair of  sneakers or some weed I have much more concern for the families of the working poor who benefit from living wages in pretty much every single study.So in short your objections to minimum wage boil down to these You think it will cause inflation in the price of goods and services but its been repeatedly shown that the benefit to low income earners and therefore to all of society are far greater than the increases in costs. You think its going to bankrupt businesses but in fact all of the best regarded studies Card and kreuger etc found that instead what happens is businesses raise prices a bit and carry on as usual. You think its going to cause huge unemployment but instead studies show it has mild effects on unemployment usually below the level of statistical significance and when it does it affects the most marginal of employees who according to things you have written elsewhere on this site are too useless to have jobs anyway.There also seems to be an implication that government has no business telling employers anything about how to run a business on purely moral grounds but I think we can dismiss that outright as soon as we note that government and by extension the taxpayer has the standing to do so because we are subsidizing businesses every time we have to give their underpaid employees social assistance to keep them off the streets.,Calgary,crgdj70,0,t5_2qn40

4041246,0,t3_36sczu,gtAfter years of lamenting the severe skills shortage in Canadas oilpatch the possibility of extreme oil price volatility in an historically volatile industry was apparently beyond comprehension only two years ago for the organization that addresses human resources issues in the oil and gas industry.The bane of the OampG industry.Everyone shouts Severe skilled labour shortage! Severe skilled labour shortage! Severe skilled labour shortage! bright driven people get difficult time consuming degrees andor work long hard hours to gain those skills.Oil shits the bed and you have unemployed people who could have been doctors or professors on the STEM side and people who could have been plant operators construction managers or firemen on the labourer side rueing the day that they decided to listen to the severe skilled labour shortage chants.Im not sure what the solution is its kind of the nature of the beast but dont ever feel too bad for energy companies when they bemoan their labour shortages in the good times because they should know by now that they do it to themselves.This was interestinggtInvestment bank AltaCorp Capital questioned Wednesday if the election result could be linked to a decline to  drilling rigs active in Alberta  even though its the traditionally slow Spring quarter  given uncertainty over a royalty review and corporate tax hike promised by the NDP during the election campaign.gtWe have been told by numerous oil service companies that the phones were slowly starting to ring again in the leadup to summer i.e. for new wells to be drilled etc. but that the phones literally went quiet again after the election result AltaCorp said in the note to clients.I said something similar yesterday,Calgary,crgxl5o,2,t5_2qn40

Ignoring that fact will not make it go away.In Calgary were at  in the winter. I dont think  is likely since we are a much larger city with greater distances to travel but given that  of Calgarians have already said they would like to ride more and given that other large North American cities with better cycling infrastructure have winter ridership rates higher than ours it is obvious that we can do better in Calgary. Go read up on Minneapolis. I found a  article estimating  winter cyclists out of  population  and a  article estimating  winter cyclists . and the numbers continue to rise as they improve their cycling infrastructure. And no Minneapolis is not a small City the metro area has . million people and a climate comparable to our own but the numbers I found are specific to Minneapolis think of it as like North Calgary.

4112514,0,t1_crp17lu,When equality is achieved there will be no more machine.Unfortunately there will always be hate and bigotry so the machine needs to be there. For me its like black rights or womens rights. There will always be people who dont like black people or women and they dont have to support things they dont believe in.But imagine if an American politician refused to go to a black rights march because he didnt like the black community. He should be criticized but if his constituents agreed with his stance he would be elected regardless of minority criticism. If mciver didnt want to go he should have said so and why instead he has blurred his stance on the issue so no one really knows how he will represent his constituency on the topic.For the record I dont think LGBT have a right to be married by a church that doesnt want to marry them. But as far as same sex marriages or civil unions go I think denying anyone those rights is as unacceptable as saying black people or Irish people cant marry.,Calgary,crp1vv2,1,t5_2qn40

4116701,0,t1_crpa16q,Housing is a lagging indicator partly because of the stickiness you mentioned.First commodity prices drop.Then contractors and a few jobs are shed.Then theres a holding pattern to see if there is a rebound.Then capital is shifted to other places.Then job growth stalls and more layoffs happen.Then disposable income is slashed restaurants bars snowmobile dealers etc suffer.Then savings accounts and EI dries up and the hard decisions come.Cars are sold first.Then second properties look for high number of listings in places like Kelowna etcThen finally primary residences.So it can take awhile. Which is good because it gives an economy awhile to recover before you have a housing drop.Anyone that thinks it wont happen is kidding themselves. Supply is up demand is down.

Weve looked under their boy and I live with his rents vehicles the neighbors vehicles in the bushes shed under anything she could have crawled under she is a tad chunky so her hiding spots are a little limited. Due to her weight she cant jump too high so she wouldnt have gotten up on the fence in the back and over it. I dont know.  I just hope shes okay. Im sure if she did end uo venturing out that she comes back.

4740181,0,t3_3fu9nl,From the commentsgtThe protesters have demonstrated that the best way that bicyclists legal compliance with stop signs will significantly impact traffic flow for others is if they assemble single file in an artificially high concentration at locations that were designed for much lower traffic volumes. If those locations handled such volume and suffered such low levels of service daily they would meet MUTCD warrants for signalization or engineers would install alternative designs such as roundabouts and level of service would improve due to smoother flow. This protest is no more a realistic demonstration of everyday bicycle traffic operations than a Critical Mass ride.Seriously they had a ridiculous number of cyclists all arrive at a small road to demonstrate congestion. If a similar number of cars arrived there all at once the line would have been even longer but its still not a genuine example of traffic flow.  What does this prove other than many cyclists arent interested in following the rules and will use dishonest means to try to prove their point. This reminds me of the friend who used to tell me when driving his car he has to speed because hes not used to driving so slow.,Calgary,cts1ls4,6,t5_2qn40

When Calgary loses a show to Edmonton its a lazy cop out to blame something truthy like snow or weak roof as if other cities dont have snow or as if other places like Lethbridge have superior stadiums.  Of course Ian wants a bidding war between Calgary and Edmonton.  Live Nation is built on monopolistic practices and inflated pricing.  But in a million years hes not going to book a show in Calgary that cannibalizes sales of an Edmonton show.  Anyone who doesnt know this pretty much disqualifies themselves from the topic.So if we ignore the highly conflicted excuse makers and opinion pieces whats left are FACT.  Fact Maroon  did play Calgary.  Fact ACDC did play domeless Regina.  Twice.   Fact the concerts youre whining about have played many many many lesser venues than the Saddledome.  Hell most of them play cities that dont have even have a miniSaddledome.  The real reasons are about economics and the relative abilities of a venue in bidding and landing shows.But hey if you prefer to believe the facesaving bullshit excuses and swallow any kind of truthiness that feeds a false narrative who am I to offer education and facts to disrupt the pity party?,Calgary,cu9n1zt,0,t5_2qn40

4881578,0,t1_cu9ugrh,If you look at the reasoning behind why Edmonton started enforcing school zones then its a no brainer. Children aged  to  years have the highest incidence of pedestrianrelated injuries. Children aged  to  years are at the greatest risk for pedestrianrelated deaths. The most common child pedestrian action that results in injury or death is crossing at an intersection followed by running onto the road. When children are struck by vehicles their injuries often result in life threatening or permanent damage. The faster a vehicle is moving the greater the impact and the more devastating the results. Under ideal conditions a vehicle travelling at  kmh needs    meters to come to a complete stop while a vehicle travelling at  kmhr only needs    meters to stop. When the roads are wet or icy you need  extra meters at  kmh and  extra meters at  kmh in order to stop safely.,Calgary,cu9uzs0,11,t5_2qn40

Also why was the nonemerg line telling her that they never remove items from the stolen cars in between all of this? Did she call from the lot?The story is shit and isnt worth the time we all took to read. A reasonable person would have checked out THEIR OWN PROPERTY thoroughly before receiving custody of it.

Think of it heavy traffic entering on position  but youre trying to get out the other direction on position  . You think youre going to make a big enough gap when three cars signal right at the end of exit? Good luck with that. But in a world where everybody used it right you could see the gap as soon as everybody gets on two exits away. Were so spoiled in Calgary with comparatively low traffic that we have all kinds of these bad habits that cost other drivers time. My other favorite is the dont signal in the turn lane. Trust me a driver going the other direction can see your blinker a hell of a lot easier then an arrow painted under your car. Seriously people act like signalling is a big imposition.

5783417,0,t1_cxdy1nb,You are correct.  That is exactly how they work.  The rich do everything they can to get all the wealth monopolies and cartels and the less rich have the choice to starve slow or starve quicker see s London the poor tend to like to draw out the process as long as possible because the alternative isnt a desirable outcome.  Not many wants to keel over and die to stop the labor surplus they all want to wait for everyone else to do so instead this means there is almost always a labour surplus.  We have discovered that a truly free market doesnt really work short of situations where expansion outstrips population growth.  It functions but it isnt pretty.  Free market theory traditionally doesnt really handle the idea of currency devaluation.  The best way to describe current debt is there is a surplus of money floating around so it is over valued.  The choice we have is to agree there is to much money and destroy the wealth popping the bubble or to just agree the currency isnt worth what it used to be and raise other prices to match tanking the currency.  Both do have their issues but they are both part of the free market.,Calgary,cxdzkuz,1,t5_2qn40

Longstory short they screwed me around and were unable to figure out what broken parts they sold me had me send in a video card for warranty that was not brokenI lost my extended manufacturer warrantylost the tax on that cardhad to pay money out of pocket to buy a new card because they screwed me over. It ended up taking over  months before my PC could run without freezing or locking up took about  phone calls to them trips there and even though my PC was there for a month the last time when I went to pick it up. my usb  connectors on my brand new case that I told them were screwed up were still loose and hanging out of my case  months after the date of initial purchase  days after the whole system was in their possession while I was out of the country I come back to pick up the system first thing I check was the usb ports and see they are still falling out of the case.The exact same useless lady that knows nothing about computers that I told a month prior asks me if I want to wait in the store while they switch everything to a new case.over  laterover  months after I bought the system and was UNABLE to use it the whole time.I will never buy another system from them ever in my life.I cannot recall the name but there is a some company online that sells badass systems with prevetted parts and everything to make sure it works perfect together prestress tested system. Basically you pick what you want order it they do a lot of hard and useful work making sure all you need to do is press the power button and have no issues. I assume someone might jump in with the name of the company or maybe you can find it by googling around. I think I found out about that company from one of the big Tech youtubers a few years back.I recall looking up pricing my own system and these prebuilt prestress tested warrantied systems and the price was around  difference.If you include just the extra expenses I had fucking around with memex it actually cost me more.If you include the time delay from when I initially purchased all the parts to the time when MemEx gave me a system that would work I paid around  in the markup on the parts because by the time I could use the system all those parts went from being almost top end to mid level at best.I paid over  by the time they managed to figure out what parts were messed up I could have bought that whole system again for around  or less.Never again MemoryExpress,Calgary,cy90y90,0,t5_2qn40

6244840,0,t1_cyzg13o,Lets go with your numbers and make some assumptions. Oil currently sits at bb. In order to double your money you would need oil at bb. Lets give this a  year horizon to be realistic. Adjusted for inflation assuming  youd need oil at a price of bb.Doubling your initial investment over  years is roughly a  return per year. Historical stock index returns have averaged around . Oil is a single commodity investment meaning zero diversification and tons of risk. Balanced index investments are much less risky with just as much return historically.If you have a high risk tolerance go ahead and bank on oil going up but its pure speculation. It is entirely reasonable to assume oil will go up but to what amount and at what rate is just guesswork. If you dont need the money and wont miss it go ahead and take the gamble. But if you do need the money you might have to pull it at a loss. Just know that the risk is many times higher than diversified investing and it is likely the return wont even beat the market.,Calgary,cyzgy53,1,t5_2qn40

Im saying we could be as well but it would cost us and that cost might not be palatable giving up being a major player as an energy center as their is very little reason for tech especially the computer technology that google works on to come here if energy is coming back.  It would also take much more then  billion dollars to be anywhere near the level Waterloo is. Edmonton is a world leader in nanobot technology.  They have a pretty good shot of becoming a major tech center as that becomes more viable.We have lots of energy companies investing in figuring out how to get more efficient sources of energy Calgary all ready competes for that tech.  If wind or solar end up winning we will have experts on that technology all ready living here.Investing in becoming softwarehardware giants at the level you want would take a major overhaul of our local economy and Im just not sure people are ready to give up on energy just yet and that would be the commitment required before companies would look here to do that kind of work.,Calgary,cz5kxai,1,t5_2qn40

Even then I was able to get to class on time albeit by the skin of my nose.I now attend MRU and I use BRT most of the time. So far the transit service is good. It only gets slow when theres rush hour traffic on Crowchild.In short  from my experience using transit  any problems Ive experienced are because some guy was not being careful enough and caused an accident that got in the way of transit services.

6437964,0,t3_43u23r,I feel like Im on the side of the parents with this one because it sounds like theres been a history of complaints. I think the difficulty with something like verbal abuse is that its really easy to brush off. If your kid comes home crying most nights and fakes sick so they dont have to go to school because their teacher was mean to them how far do you go as a parent? Parents may not always discuss things amongst themselves and  or  complaints to administration can be easily brushed aside. I think the Facebook post brought a bunch of parents out of the woodwork who may have been feeling uneasy but didnt know that others were feeling the same way and it wasnt just their overprotectiveness talking. And unless theres another forum for parents to talk like that I think Facebook is filling a real need.Also I think overall this could have been avoided if administration had acted on previous complaints more openly. Once is an accident twice is a coincidence but three times is a pattern. A teacher with a history of parent complaints needs to be held accountable for them although I get that its a fine line between holding teachers accountable and holding them hostage to the whims of a few helicopter busybodies.,Calgary,czl82nc,3,t5_2qn40

6519183,0,t1_cztjsc3,There are many facets to their business model some are sketchier then others and some are very good and a huge improvement.  They can raise rates for quicker service.  This is something cabs cant do but could change soon.  This is something Uber can and should profit off of.They have a dispatch system that works really well for picking up people in the suburbs.  Their ability to handle this situation is somthing they can and do profit off of.They have a belief that their drivers are part time and shouldnt be held to the same standards as professional drivers...who might also be part time even though they are doing the same thing.  They then pass the savings of not having commercial level liability on to the customer giving them the lowest price.  This is something they shouldnt be able to profit from. Lots of the discussion is around settling this issueThey also offload liabilityresponsibility to the drivers.  This allows them to avoid stuff like minimum wage or to be held accountable for people acting in their name they just network two random people together and assist in one paying the other but if something goes wrong it wasnt the app that picked either of them.  This hasnt been a huge issue in Canada but other Jurisdictions have begun treating Uber like the employer of the driver when it comes to how incidents are treated Im not sure any have been resolved yet and even if they were Im not sure if they have any standing in Canada.

Is there a list somewhere youre reading from with witty knowledge tidbits to thrill others with?

Were starting to pay serious attention to the market though starter homescondos may not have dropped in price much but there do seem to be more of them on the market than there were a year ago likely due to people leaving town who were really only here for one specific job and then left when said job evaporated theres also lots of townhomeshouses in our neighbourhood that are relatively newlybuilt or are brand new and that are up for sale  far more than when we arrived last year. Those places are out of our price range  to  range but their prevalence is notable  so many for sale signs in the area a good one in the SW. Ultimately more selection is never a bad thing and can eventually put enough pressure on the market to result in people taking somewhat less than their asking price. Give it another six months in late summerearly fall and I imagine things will be even more affordable. I hate the idea of profiting off of someone elses misfortune but for a relatively young couple from Vancouver I hope people can understand that Calgary gives us an opportunity we would have never had back home.

One of the NDPs worst policy mistakes is getting even worse.They implemented the new emissions targets for the Specific Gas Emitters Regulation SGER with basically no notice to anyone. The result of this was that ENMAX and ATCO and now Capital Power have handed back control of their Power Purchase Arrangements to the Balancing Pool funded by taxpayers on coal plants because they were now uneconomic to hold as is allowed under a very specific and obvious clause thats well known throughout the power industry. This move could potentially cost taxpayers M in excess fees on their power bills. Now the NDP is looking into it which pretty much translates as we had no idea this would happen.

7324955,0,t1_d2arnze,Thanks for the lesson. They should factor it into the price like they do with coffee otherwise its like going for a cup of coffee and being told that the barista is off on holiday so you cant actually have coffee but you still have to pay for one anyway simply because you are a regular customer. You cant expect anyone to be happy at that even their annual coffee expenditure would be the same. I suppose my issue is that I only have my daughter in for  days a week Thursdays and Fridays and statutory holidays often fall on a Friday. Others have their kids in for  days a week. If they factored the cost of staff holiday pay into the daily rate then this extra cost to the customer would be prorated depending on how many days a week you have your kid in.

Took my car to them for the rd time various reasons picked up my car and the dash was cracked and my car smelled like glue. I talked to the manager who talked to the tech who quickly told me that it was broken when I brought it in.   Me being a  year old kid with a luxury sedan I knew that car inside and out. There was no way I had a cracked dashboard right where the ignition switch is. I wrote them a letter included pictures and was very polite about the misunderstanding . The owner then phoned me a lady I do not remember her name she explained to me that my Dashboard was broken and that they were not going to be pressured by me to fix my mistakes. I have not supported them since I have not Stopped sharing my experience either. This was  years ago. It was a  Acura legend and I miss it.

7743667,0,t1_d3lut7i,People move where they do for many reasons very few people can logistically afford to live exactly where they want to and no area is perfect.Since Im new to Caglary having come by way of Vancouver and Europe I wanted to live near downtown without being right in it. I needed space for my dogs and covered parking because I love my car and dont want it to get pounded to dust by hail or frozen solid on  nights. I wanted to be nearish to shopping and a decent coffee shop and gym. Where I moved to Marda Loop area has all of that. The only real protest I have is that I think the area is out of touch with the true value of the area I feel this opinion is supportable because housescondos sell here very very slowly  few people think a sharedwall townhome is worth nearly seven figures.To more broadly answer your question I didnt know Calgary well enough when I moved here though I did substantial reading and research on the various areas before coming and am fairly pleased that I managed to get an accurate picture of where I ended up before I even visited for initial rentalbrowsing.

These wells most certainly cannot be unscrewed and produce oil right away. Well completions are  of the total cost of AFE which means that a considerable amount of investment is still required for that well to produce oil. Thats one well and most companies have multiple pads of wells drilled and uncompleted which would require a lot of money. This would take months. Couple this with the fact that money is hard to come by means you definitely will not see a rush of US oil back online when oil gets above the  mark.

My fence isnt high enough on one side live in a duplex and there is a ft fence around both yards but only a ft fence between the two so I was disqualified from one agency during the home visit. Other agencies would likely deny me because I dont agree with their preferred training methods or rather I agree  but also incorporate other methods. If I were to be looking for another dog I would probably find one though BARCS as they seem fairly reasonable.My dogs came from Kijiji. They were all in need of rehoming cost  not from puppymills or backyard breeders. One was only a year old her owner had committed suicide and left her with his friends who couldnt care for her. Another was an old dog  yo who liked to wander off the acreage he lived on and onto the highway and needed a city home and I think the previous owners didnt want a senior dog  but I love old dogs!. My new dog is just a puppy but has special needs. He was born on a farm up north and was likely going to be put down issues with pawleg  no good for a working dog but the sister of the original owner fostered him in Calgary and until she could find a new owner. I think Im a pretty good dog mom  all my dogs see the vet regularly my little guy even goes to rehab twice a week Im able to be home midday to spend time with them they go to training classes regularly and daycare for socialization I feed them premium food and they have more toys than they need... so its pretty discouraging when a rescue organization looks at my fence and say NOPE.

These type of accounts have extremely broad administrative purposes. Although it isnt necessary to use this type of account to do work on the server it is common practice in many IT shops.Then he decides to open up Internet Explorer  on the server  and check his email so so bad  but I have seen this happen. He opens up an attachment. The attachment is ransomware and immediately encrypts the entire hard drives of the Exchange server which holds all UofC staffs email mailboxes. Server is now useless.Typically a backup from a previous day or hours depending on their policy could resolve. Could be many reasons why the backup failed or was not available. Im sure UofC will have some discussions on their backup policy and testing of their backups after this.,Calgary,d40clok,2,t5_2qn40

I said gtThere are currently only  people who use any form of public transit to get to work downtown each morning rush hour down by  due to the mass layoffs of  downtown oil company workers.The citys  downtown cordon activity data shows we did see a pretty significant use in transit over the last  to  years said Ekke Kok manager of transportation data for the city. It used to be in  about half the people were coming downtown by car and now it is only  per cent.During the morning rush hour  Calgarians head into the core with . per cent using transit . per cent driving . per cent walking and . per cent riding a bicycle.The numbers which are rounded up to the nearest  are collected each May by city staff at  key points  typically one spot per day  into downtown over a threeweek period.gtSo the City said their own data showed a peak premass oil layoffs of  commuting to work downtown each morning.  Now post layoffs in a downtown with half the office towers nearly empty of workers a  number would probably be an overstatement. The truth probably is an even smaller number.,Calgary,d5sn6aj,-3,t5_2qn40

We price match as much as possible with COOP and Sobeys but people inherently think were more expensive because were a smaller independent store. There are several items we are intentionally the cheapest place in the city for. Kicking Horse coffee is just one of them. We use pricing guidelines from a Neilsen its a company that goes around and checks pricing at stores in your region and provides the data to retailers upstairs that makes it so we should cheaper than a competitive Shoppers store. Were going to try and do more instore sales downstairs to see if that helps perception among people who are new to the area. If anyone has any ideas on what else we should be doing differently please let us know. ,Calgary,d6lfn7j,2,t5_2qn40

I find the front line staff have more authority with Westjet compared to AC especially in the last few years. This was even told to me by a really nice ac agent that was trying to help me when I was stranded in Edmonton. She said  years ago she would have this fixed in  minutes have me in a room with a meal and a flight out the next day. She had been working for them her whole working career and had to have been coming on to her sixties. Just recently I flew Westjet with my family and they lost the car seat. They gave us a brand new convertible seat to keep which ac would do as well but also gave us a  travel voucher all within maybe  minutes.  They delivered our seat for next day. I travelled the next month with AC and checked a play pen and one lb bag. The first agent told me I was going to have to pay the overweight fee on the second bag. I get two free bags with AC. I put up a fuss and had to speak to too many people to skip the fee. The average weight between the two bags was  pounds. They lost the playpen and the only thing I got was a story about how someone stole the agents phone. Air Canada initially jacked flights out of Fort McMurray during the wild fires. Westjet? We all know what Westjet did. Ive had more cancellations flight changes delays and lost bags with AC than Westjet but Westjet seems to handle them as a whole with more grace.

8856196,0,t3_51h1el,Its interesting to watch both the highly ignorant articles and comments along with brewers in other provinces piss and moan about whats happening here. I brew professionally. I have worked for several craft breweries in Alberta. Ive also been involved in the production limit reduction planning by the AGLC. The long short here is that nobody was bitching while Alberta stimulated the craft brewing industry by setting up the new west partnership. That was to create consumer demand. Now there needs to be a reason to start a brewery in a very expensive province to operate in compared to contract brewing and importing under the NWP. Steamwhistle wasnt bitching when consumer demand was ramped up. They werent complaining as our private liquor stores stocked up and promoted craft beer to an essentially non existent craft market. But now that the segment is growing rapidly they have the balls to start a lawsuit. Funny how that works.,Calgary,d7ce18k,9,t5_2qn40

8971999,0,t1_d7pwet8,Sounds to me like you need a strong diversity of volunteer experiences e.g. youth homeless minorities.... BBampS might be a good start but you need to be thinking long term. Pick  volunteer positions and stick with them for one year before moving on. This will help show commitment to an experience while diversifying your resume. You should be looking for volunteer opportunities now through your current school. Where can you volunteer in Lethbridge?Also take up some extracurricular activities. Join a few clubs where you can demonstrate that you were in a governing role. You dont have to be president but you should be an active participating member. Finally IIRC BBampS is no longer accepting volunteers because they are lacking donations They have put a freeze on training.EDIT BBampS is a great volunteer organization but deals with a very specific group of people. While it is important to get experience working with children I think you would be better served looking into volunteering with organizations that specifically work with minorities and vulnerable people e.g. homeless halfway houses womens shelters.... Even consider thinking outside the box like volunteering at a seniors home or with seniors groups. For better or for worse these are going to be a lot of the people that you are going to be working with on a daily basis.Here is what I would do. Realize that you arent going to get hired by CPS in the next few years you are too young. . Call CPS recruiting or attend a recruiting event so that you can get your questions answered directly.. Finish your degree either in Lethbridge or Calgary and during that time volunteer and commit to extracurricular activities.. Keep up with your physical fitness its an important part of the recruiting process.. Apply for CPS but dont get discouraged when they reject you the first time thats very normal.

9166387,0,t1_d8du0rq,No one is saying costs wont go up they will.  In both those industries though labour accounts for about  of the cost so even a  wage hike means a  cost increase.  We see this increase in costs when beef goes up in price or if we see a real estate spike.  The customer always eats the increaseThe manager will who makes  an hour will get a raise because there is no reason to be a manager making the same amount as a basic laborer.  If I can be paid  an hour to not have the responsibilities or  to have the extra responsibilities it is a pretty easy choice.The good news is this is one of the major ways to stimulate the local economy.  Minimum wage earners dont invest and dont save they spend everything they earn and most of it is spent locally.  That pub burger that went from  to  dollars sucks but the fact that low income earners can do a couple extra pub nights a month even with the burger cost increases and that will do a pretty good number for business.  The movie might cost more but if I dont need  minimum wage jobs to make ends meet the chances of me having time and money to go see a movie a few times a year goes up a pile.The people who are hurt by this the most are business owners whose low income employees have no chance of ever being able to use the services the business offers.

I was led back to the work area and lo and behold the technician was able to remove the wheel nut while the service advisor and I watched.

Why would you take our shitty transit system when you do have the option to drive? Yes you are correct in that public transit is for everyone not just the poor but the fact of the matter is that placing a lrt line in a wealthy area leads to lower utilization as opposed to if we had placed the line in an area where people dont have the option to drive. Placing the line where people with lower incomes can access it means you improve their ability to work and contribute to the economy by giving them transportation. If you build it in a wealthy area it doesnt change the economic participation of the wealthy at all if theyre already driving to work. ,Calgary,d9lrzyf,4,t5_2qn40

9767311,0,t1_dagx2kn,Well the term sulfa drugs means it contains a sulfonamide group in its chemical structure. There are antibiotic sulfa drugs and nonantibiotic sulfa drugs. I dont know much about nonantibiotic sulfa drugs except that they do a lot of different things and are less likely to cause the really interesting side effects that antibiotic sulfa drugs can cause.Sulfonamides were one of the first widely used antibiotics. They were a modern miracle but they had a high rate of side effects compared to more modern antibiotics. And there were some horrific side effects. Some people would have their skin go necrotic and fall off. And their mucous membranes too I think. Extremely painful often fatal. Still better than your chances of surviving some streptococcus infections.Sulfa antibiotics are still used just not when there are other reasonable options. Theyre also getting some interest because people improperly use antibiotics around the world both for personal use and in agriculture and so antibiotic resistance is on the rise. Theres a really interesting study of Russian medicine cabinets that is worth looking up on PubMed I believe. Pretty much all Russian medicine cabinets have numerous halffinished antibiotic bottles in them and patients expect physicians to prescribe them for everything even things that theyre utterly useless against.

9875910,0,t1_dauihq3,Thats really terrible sorry you had to go through that. It sucks so much that the system put in place to help sometimes fails and people get hurt. Do you know how many people the creep catchers have placed behind bars? Zero. The police said they cant ever take their evidence because of the methods they use to get it. Theyre actually making things worse more than helping. When they convince a possible pedophille to meet up with them and expose them what do you think theyre going to do? As soon as they get home theyre going to destroy all of the evidence go deeper underground and maybe even alert other pedos about whats happening. This puts legitimate investigations at risk because someone theyve been chasing for possibly years could just disappear ruining leads and that sort of thing. Will they stop being pedos? Unlikely. Theyll just do it again maybe harming other kids in the future or who knows what. I used to think the creep catchers did what they do out of a desire to make the world a better place which some of them still do of course but after watching the videos and looking through their website and stuff to me it looks like theyre mainly doing it for money now. The videos all have ads they promote them heavily they even sell merchandise on their website. From the Edmonton ICE team Creep Catchers vigilante efforts against child predators hinders investigations police officer saysAndAs we can see from analyzing their website theyre a forprofit organization Camp said. Theyre in it for a number of reasonsandone of them is commercial enterprise.

If you however do the ol Calgary merge speeding to pass as many vehicles as possible  and maybe juuuust that extra one too  and then whip into the next lane then it does not. What people fail to understand and where they usually get it wrong is that if you are going to merge with another lane it is YOUR responsibility to NOT or at least minimally disrupt the flow of that lane. You cannot just force your way into another lane thinking you have the right of way. You dont! This applies to onramps as well for heavens sake match the speed of the next lane it makes things so much easier.edit for wording,Calgary,dcbdwz8,3,t5_2qn40

10421979,0,t3_5p8ss1,Before a bunch of you consider hopping on a vigilante bandwagon consider that you werent there and that whatever the witness believes they saw may not have actually happened the way they saw it.Years ago one of my grandfathers was accused of having hit a little girl crossing a street and having driven away afterward. Some concerned bystander remembered his licence plate and filed a report with the police. My grandfather who was in his s at the time was detained and brought to a police station later that day and eventually charged with a hit and run. They came to believe a flustered old man had inadvertently run into a little girl although they found no physical evidence on his car that he had ever made contact.There was no physical evidence he hit her because he didnt. In reality the little girl and her older sister had crossed the street my grandfather had properly yielded to them and just as he was passing the little girl tripped over her own feet and fell off the curb back into the roadway behind his car. The bystanders view was obscured they were across the street when it all allegedly happened. What they saw was a little girl fall off the curb after my grandfathers car had passed. The girl had bumps and bruises from having fallen. They never witnessed any contact they just imagined a scenario where it happened they just assumed shed been hit. Nobody trusted the fouryearold who told the bystander and the police that she tripped and fell.Fortunately for him the charges were dropped but not until after hed spent some money on a lawyer and fretted a lot about what had happened. He was more worried about having actually done it without realizing it than about whatever fine they wanted to mete out for a hit and run he was terrified that dementia was setting in eventually it did it killed him years later.So you know whatever you think you might do to help in this case is probably not very helpful at all. Personally I believe this post ought to be deleted lest it fester into a bunch of stupid gossip.,Calgary,dcpefgv,22,t5_2qn40

10582345,0,t1_dd76suu,No I wont down vote you because you are correct. When people first came to North America they brought disease and war with them. Not that it wasnt here before but they brought it on a level that the original people couldnt handle and it nearly wiped them out. And then what happened? They ended up on reserves. But that isnt anything to do with what I said originally so im not going to bother speaking about it any farther. It was a very different time from what we have now and the comparisons arent really that relevant.   I said that we should take care of our own problems because at the current time they are so big that I think we should focus on getting Alberta and Canada back into a strong economic position before we try and bring more people in. I just found a job after being unemployed for nearly  months. There are a lot of people out there who havent been able to find a job and their EI has run out. These people people who are here right now need our help. They are already a part of our communities and deserve our help. Canada has literally zero obligation to help anyone from an outside country. Is it good of us to help other countries? sure.   But that doesnt mean that that we do it at the cost of letting our own people fall down so far that they cant recover. What kind of a country do we want to bring people into? One that is strong or one that is failing. Currently we are failing. Failing to help our own people. Failing to feed our own people. And I think that should be our focus before we start taking on problems that the rest of the world has. It kills me every time I see someone saying that the plight of syrians makes them upset. Im glad that you have sympathy. But maybe turn off the TV and look out the window. The people across the road are starving. Open your heart up to them... And you are right about one thing. Bringing in people who have been checked and vetted wont have a large impact on Canadians in general. But there will be impact. And not one that should happen. If you feel up to it look up the incidents at a Fredericton New Brunswick highschool. There are syrian refugees who are attending the school. The refugees are in their s. Young men. One particular incident involved a  year old girl. At a highschool dance a group of these refugees surrounded her groped her breasts and put their hands down her pants and molested her. The result of this? A week suspension for the man who put his hands down her pants. And the young girl? Months of missed school due to psychological issues that she has developed since. Oh and a lecture that if she hadnt dressed like thatthe articles dont describe what she was wearing that it wouldnt have happened. That maybe she should see the point of view from the young man who wasnt used to seeing women dressed in what I can only assume was tight clothing. Isnt that like blaming a rape victim for getting raped? I wonder what would happen if I went to a highschool dance and sexually assaulted a  year old girl... So yeah maybe Canadians arent being rounded up and put onto reserves like what happened before when North America was being colonized. But there is still an impact. So please dont try and make a comparison to what happened many many years ago. It was a different time and different situation. There are problems now simply saying hey your ancestors werent from here doesnt make anything any better at all. And it doesnt excuse anything at all. ,Calgary,dd7hjud,2,t5_2qn40

10596275,0,t3_5rly1l,Hi there. Im sorry youre going through this! Its NOT fun to constantly get sick and miss out on so much stuff. Im  and I had my tonsils removed when I was . I used to get sick with upper respiratory infections and inflamed tonsils ALL the time. I had problems with getting colds and flus my whole life and finally a friend suggested to me Why dont you go see an ENT doc? Heres the name of one that I saw and he was fantastic I realized that it might not just be my shitty immune system it might be my tonsils that are prone to infection causing all this. There were many GPs that brushed me off through the years and this time my GP suggested that its probably in my head even after seeing me three times in one season with a fever and tonsils that even she said looked like huge cherries. I immediately found a new family doctor that would put in a referral to an ENT specialist and I took it into my own hands to push that forward.I went to bookingmd.com to find Dr Ian Huang and booked an appt online and got a confirmation email... then when I showed up at his office the morning of the appt the receptionist said she didnt have any record of me but I showed her my confirmation email and they said theyd squeeze me in. When I got in to see the doctor he told me that I can keep treating each infection as it comes or I can remove the tonsils. He had an opening in the ER two months down the road which I happily booked. I found Dr Ian Huang to be prompt straight forward and his work on my throat left zero complications. I would recommend him to anyone!I wont sugar coat the recovery. The reason its easy for kids to get a tonsillectomy is because their bodies are still developing and the tonsils arent as embedded as they are in an adult. At your age all the veins and muscle are so integrated that the procedure is not as easy and the recovery is very difficult. You will absolutely need someone to be your full time caretaker for at least three weeks post op. You will be in a lot of pain you will have to relearn how to swallow you will throw up a lot and the worst part for me is that you wont be able to talk for about a month. I had a little whiteboard and marker to communicate with my husband if i wasnt texting him. You also wont be able to eat any hot food or solid food for a couple of weeks. You have to really put your foot down and be very stern with people sometimes if you want something done. Im a  female with a squeaky voice and I was never taken seriously until I learned to be extremely assertive and be stern when I have to be. Good luck with this and message me any time if you have any questions or help!,Calgary,dd8xa5l,5,t5_2qn40

South of th or off of Skytrain lines when you cross water and things suddenly change. The lifestyle becomes like any other suburban part of North America. If not worse because the road system cant handle the volume and there are horrible choke points. The morning commute is an absolute clusterfuck and offpeak hours in Vancouver feel like rush hour in Calgary.Dont run your mouth like other people dont understand or dont know what its really like there.Maybe you should pick better neighbourhoods to live in in Calgary. I easily went several days to weeks without ever using a car in Calgary as well. Yes I could easily walk to get groceries and public transit to and from work was a daily thing.Keep on talking in hyperboles and making the same bullshit Best Place On Earth claims I heard from Vancouverites. The level of selfdelusion in that city is as bad as the shit right wing petrodollar conservatards tell themselves in Calgary. Both groups are full of shit.Vancouver does have a better transit system. I would expect it to be for a metro area that hit a million people in the early s compared to Calgary that hit that number some time in the late s to early s. Even then rail transit between high density areas and the universities doesnt exist there for some reason and only recently was it possible to rapidly go from downtown to Richmond.

10782923,0,t3_5u8g5x,Congrats on getting a local clothing company going. I am a big fan of Naked and Famous denim and it will be nice to have another Canadian option.I gotta say though I am not a fan of the pocket embroidery design either. It is too ornate. A lot of denim heads will have a problem with that. I am not a fan of Nudie jeans because of this see this thread for how polarizing that can be I imagine you want to differentiate your product and that can be a challenge in the raw denim market but I am not sure this is the way to go. If you can make an affordable well made well fitting product the rest will take care of itself. I think a better option is to have fun with the leather patch if you do one pocket bags or the rivets. Small details that the owner of the product and denim heads will know. Let me know when you get this going would like to take a pair for a test drive. I didnt touch raw denim until about  years ago now it is all I wear. Hands down more comfortable and durable and in the long run more affordable.,Calgary,dds6hn7,3,t5_2qn40

10838857,0,t1_ddxxeal,I think that you are in the same boat that im in. There is so much demand for these courses... I assumed that I would get in. I had decent marks in high school. But I didnt make the cut. Which doesnt mean that you wont get in... So go for it apply. Worst that can happen is you wont get in but at least you tried. If you dont try you are guaranteed not to get in. And it does make sense... that if you are already a lab assistant that you would stand a better chance of getting into the lab tech program. I dont know that they take that into consideration though at SAIT. In the testing session the questions were geared towards organizationfor example. One of the things we had to do was listen to a prerecorded tape of instructions. As we were listening to the instructions we had to write them down in bullet point form. It was hard because it was a full page of writing. If you fall behind you wont be able to hear the instruction and keep up. If you rush to keep up it means that you have to take shortcuts. Hard to explain even harder to do. But not something that you would learn in school it was more about your ability to understand instruction keep up with it and write things down in a manner that still made sense. Which are all kind of life skills... Anyway point is that at no time in the testing session did I think that it would have helped me if I already had experience in the field. I think that because its a publically funded school they have to give a fair chance to everyone. Based on your life and basic education skills not anything you may have picked up in any kind of advanced education like what you would learn in the med lab assistant course. So if you did get into the assistant course great you can pass that and get a job. But I dont think that its going to help you get into the technologist course. ,Calgary,ddxy96v,2,t5_2qn40

Samsung Canada does not honor the warranty of Samsung USA phones and Samsung USA will not repair phones for Canadians.  US Shipping address is required.     Some of these sellers might take a faulty product back when the issue is found on receipt but if you have an issue down the road you will not have any warranty coverage.Almost all of these phones including the ones from London Drugs are refurbished US carrier phones.  Even if they say Rogers Fido Bell etc. on the adds thats just a claim that it will work with these services which it will it is not a claim that the phone itself is Canadian in origin.  London Drugs probably would be a bit safer from the warranty front as they are more likely to exchange out the phone for another one in stock after it has been used. ,Calgary,def8pup,1,t5_2qn40

Just a bunch of crap they pulled out of their ass and hoped wed pay for.  It was insulting.I want details evidence and well thought out arguments that are informed by basic city planning principles  and how the arena fits in to that.  If they had presented that as an investment plan to attract private capital asking for the amount they were asking they would have been laughed out of every office they went to.I dont care where they end up building it if they want money from the city theyd better show something better than last time.Do your goddamn homework Flames. ,Calgary,dezdi1h,6,t5_2qn40
