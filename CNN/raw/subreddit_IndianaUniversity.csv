278043,0,t1_cf9k81h,Thanks your comments actually provide tremendous insight into a system that affects a lot of people but the details of which very few really understand including me.I understand why IU wants to employ as many students as possible its a worthy goal and it makes logistical sense. That said if theres a true recruitment problem then Campus Bus should be open to hiring additional nonstudent drivers.By the way in case you arent aware theres a very widespread perception that only students are employed to drive campus buses. And no wonder the sidebar item on the website says student employment. The recruitment poster says Recruiting Student Bus Operators. Perhaps technically speaking nonstudents can be hired but for all practical purposes they arent since no one knows its even possible.,IndianaUniversity,cf9kyat,1,t5_2sfjy

459579,0,t3_1zaw6n,If you can afford it youre accepted. The credits are nice but they force a meal plan on you and after IFS ends there are a couple days before the semester begins. The dorms make you pay extra to live there during this time and you have to forage for food yourself because RPS isnt open. Plus you run out of your mealpoints pretty quickly. And if you have a car theyll assure you its okay to bring it however they screwed me over by not providing parking amp got slapped with a couple  parking tickets.

If your SAT is awesome but your GPA sucked or vice versa you are on the fence. If both are decent you are probably in. That is if you have not committed any crimes or been caught cheating in a major way.I think what many people dont know is that for undergraduate applicants the extra things extracurricular activities even reference letters only matter if your scores and GPA fall on the fence or below standard. If your scores and GPA are in the green you get admitted based on that no one even looks at anything else. If your scores and GPA are not so hot you get scrutinized more closely to see if theres justification to admit you.,IndianaUniversity,cnhyy1y,6,t5_2sfjy

5047761,0,t3_3k1u07,I lived at The Village a few years ago and Ive gotta say that I do miss it. The place is only college students and a couple of livein police officers. It is quite expensive at  per person for the cheap  bedroom townhouse but it does include nice Internet satellite TV and furniture. The downside the shuttle system can be packed for some hours of the day so be prepared to stand or catch the next one. Luckily theyve recently installed a GPS tracker and an app that will help. Another con the pool is like x and is only  foot deep. Its embarrassing to say the least but they do let you drink at it. As for parties this place is so large that it really is tough meeting just the right people who party. For the entire year we lived here we maybe went to a handful of parties but smaller gatherings were more normal and less likely to be broken up by the cops that drive through every half hour. Upsides the place is really nice but its plagued with the same thin walls as any other new college apartment. The shuttles that take you to class turn into the party shuttle on weekend nights and they will take you and pick you up from the bars. If there is a good consensus on the bus which is usual theyll take you to get fast food. ,IndianaUniversity,cuug2sv,1,t5_2sfjy

5295568,0,t3_3n585t,. Youll find anything if youre willing to look.. Yep libraries and private rooms. I know a ton. Four separate groups of friends have opened a restaurant and one started an app. Im Chinese though and Chinese students seem to be more into this kind of stuff.. On campus is decently safe. Off campus gets a bit sketchy. International students seem to get robbed at gun or knifepoint all the time but I havent heard too much happening with American natives.. It might be tough getting a single as a freshman. Dorm life really isnt all that crazy though.. Business school is extremely easy here. Compared to other universities the workload is really light and youll definitely breeze through the first two years if youre decently intelligent. Take advantage of those easy classes to work more on networking and clubs. If you didnt test out of it youll be taking finite math which is more or less a review of junior year of high school. Oh and dont let Chinese students rope you into cheating. I know its bad to stereotype but once again Im Chinese myself and this is very true even among students that could get straight As without doing so.
