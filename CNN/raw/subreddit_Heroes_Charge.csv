2718053,0,t1_cnd0l6c,So far I have  tokens for old curse. Definitely working on him next. Just beefed up lightning masters skills to so he can interrupt up to current level. Seems anyone with a war chief or an old curse dominates me still through. Even brute destroys my team. Ill switch out chaplain and try lightning for the extra dps.

I dont think you need the vanguard warrior and silencer probably doesnt have the dmg output you need.Id replace VW and silencer with high single target dmg people and go ham.MAKE SURE to save your supers for as long as possible.  When you use your super it gives him energy.,Heroes_Charge,cnxinxp,1,t5_342t6

2953285,0,t1_co3smpg,It really depends on what type of fighting you like. I have a guildmate using panda bear savage one shadow and psychic sword because he loves physical attackers. They get stunned less and with that combo he has two people whose th skill boosts physical damage. Savage one reduces physical armor and bear and drunken panda have super strong physical ultimates. Since I dont have all of those heroes Im going more magic based and using sapper mystic warchief shadow and trying to decide my best th but currently using succubus. What is your goal? Doing well in the arena? What heroes do you have? Commando is great for attack speed boost and is essential in a lot of parties but not all. I keep her leveled for crusades. ,Heroes_Charge,co3swep,1,t5_342t6
3008504,0,t1_co9g7ud,He is right about Commando is a standard in every team till  when people get more creative. About leveling up many heroes... if you can afford it keep on that but i can make some advise on what you should level up and what you shouldnt.   Imperial Executioner Not very usefull unless you make a team around him so i wouldnt level him untill much later on probably   Admiral You need another tank ASAP she is really useless untill  when she gets the orange skill that gives her more HP.  Emberstar A good single target nuke but so squishy better look for other one even when she is usefull for female trial and  portals unlocks at lv i think  Lightning Master Its ok untill you get some better heroes keep in mind every hero has a spot at lv  but its a long way to get there. For Magic Trials could work while you get better heroes.  Cleric Not a really good tank used in  healers team comp a lot of fun Chaplain  Shadow Shaman  Cleric  Death Knight  Death Mage for example. If you can get another tank it would be great as you wont really use this one too much.  Tusked Storm A GREAT hero for guild raids he does insane amount of damage at Chapters  and  also being kinda usefull on the others. If you use him with Rifleman and Shadow Leaves i guarantee you that you will get top dmg dealer if they are geared and max skilled  Commando A MUST for almost every team comp till . Use her just use her.  Sniper I dont know really much about how well he does in the late game but for sure before s you wont need him. Maybe it has some uses for you on physical trial.  Phoenix A really good hero for trials and  portals unlocks at lv  i think but i dont know how it works on arena or crusade though.  Silencer Great hero very usefull if used with the right comp.  Psychopath A really good tank at  but the thing is that early on is not very usefull because of the difficult to get him more stars you need to beat elite   Death Knight Is a must for crusade before purple keep leveling him.  Iron Hoof The best tank you have and a really good one War Chief is better until  when at that point it depends on team comp.  Lightning Elemental A great hero before purple i got him and was my best hero till i reached purple when he became a hero that i only use for magic trial till i level up Frost Mage  Frost Mage A great hero for crusade after purple female trial and  or  portals. Good in a magic team comp such us Mystic  Death Mage  Old Curse  Frost Mage  Machinist  Shadowleaf So underrated is great because of her purple skill wich gives bonus ad dmg to the team. Level her trust me.  Chaplain Just a must for crusade throughout the entire game.   I would recomend you to go with the Cookie Cutter team War Chief  Commando  Shadow Leaves  Old Curse  Lunar GuardianSuccubusWind Master so if i were you i would try to get these heroes cause they are just so powerfull until . But as you asked a team comp with your actual heroes i would say  For Arena Iron Hoof  Shadow Leaves  Lightning Elemental  Frost Mage  Commando. Maybe replace Shadow Leaves with Phoenix you should try it.  For Crusade Death Knight  Chaplain  Commando  Lightning Elemental  Any DPS Shadow Leaves would work.  For Guild Raids Depends on what chapter but i would say for the first one Iron Hoof  Tusked Storm  Shadow Leaves  Commando  Any Dps try different heroes and see wich one does more dmg.FYI i would suggest you to get War Chief ASAP and get him  stars because is such a great tank the most powerfull until  and the easiest to farm because he has  early maps to farm him. In Arena get Old Curse and work on him until  and then see if you want to keep working on him to  or change to Panda when you get there you will know. In Guild Shop get Arcabe Sapper to  ASAP is a beast at  before he kinda sucks but at that point onwards he is so powerfull that people do team comps just to counter him. In Crusade Shop work on Commando and get her  then Mystic until at least  then depending on how hard is for you crusade get Frost Mage to  or work on him to  maybe you want Mystic gtFrost Mage gt Mystic .Edit Format,Heroes_Charge,co9tut7,1,t5_342t6

Im going to try and create something for you but keep in mind what i suggest is things related to how i would run them and im at a higher level.Strongest team physical setupWC  VS  Tusked storm  Rifleman  Commando  You could use drow in here as well for her aura when she is purple  If WC isnt purple then he will not work here but this type of line up would do well if they are purpleMagic lineupBrute  EB  OC  Phoenix  Mystic  If i recall brute is good at mid level and should be alright for surviving decently long here giving your phoenix time to use her ultimate  EB here could be switched out for another person perhaps but i hear he is quite amazing at mid levelThird team Random left overs thrown togetherDK  VWAdmiral  Master mageLightning master  machinist  emberstar  Kinda just random wouldnt count on this defeating anything...I havnt used AS because from my understanding until level  he dies instantly. I didnt want to list machinist because before purple he doesnt do that well needs his red button Psychopath could be useful not to sure how he would do at your level but definitely is useful later on Dont know that much about VW teams but he could probably be utilized better lightning master and master mage are basically never used in higher levels same with sniperFeel free to chime in on anything else but thought id take a stab.,Heroes_Charge,cp69e8o,1,t5_342t6

3472026,0,t3_300tcu,IF you are just starting i might recommend taking your initial burst of gems and putting it towards the x gold chests. You guaranteed at least  star hero and you usually can pick up  or  more from it. It IS a pretty big risk though but it can pay off big. I received War chief cloudwalker and a rifleman from the x chests which was a huge help.Stamina is probably your best bet. doing  stam resets a day can give your a huge boost towards leveling up and item collection. Even if you need money do not spend gems on Midas aside from the daily quest.Elite resets are good as well but i wouldnt go overboard. as long as you do the proper elites daily you should have the correct heroes by the time you need them.,Heroes_Charge,cpo1b97,3,t5_342t6

4711038,0,t3_3fdx4b,Hello fellow Soul HunterI also quit this game and went back to Heroes Charge.I was VIP still is at Soul Hunters and was onit  trying to maintain a good arena top rank. This became insanely difficult when the game is entirely PAYWIN literally it is PAY to WIN because the cost of gemsdiamonds is needed for every aspect of their game including temple and trials. I also like to reiterate the very difficult fact about their Crusade Crucible of Fire is that no matter how much effort you put into a team that can counter the next batch of heroes you face will be insanely difficult. In my entire soul hunters career Ive only successfully finished CrusadeCrucible of Fire  ONCE.For me it was ALWAYS against the top  of server  and they are all VIP and within the same Guild Mirage. Worst of all one of the members is an ADMIN opening day of server he had Hidden Needle at  star. The rest of the members spends thousands if not tenthousands to keep their ranks top. It is impossible to dethrone and the worst part is Ive always faced them at my last crusade making it impossible to complete.Even my guild mates who were VIP found it insanely difficult to keep up and finish Crucible.Who knew that Liliths game would be so difficult and paywin?Anyway I was able to quit within days level s of my purchase and got a full refund. ,Heroes_Charge,ctod598,2,t5_342t6

Northern Dragon Iron Hoof  P i hired this oneGriffin  POC  P Poisoned One  P Again hired Leaves  PJust an auto attacking one nothing to note here. I also was able to do this by swapping griffin for pilot and using his ult while he was behind the dragon so the dragon couldnt attack him. But who uses pilot these days. .  Phoenix PortalWizard Doctor  P Machinist  PDM  PChaplain  PWar Chief  PThis is my easiest portal you just need to survive until . when phoenix goes into egg once you see wizard doctor curse the egg release all ults simultaneously and itll be done.Lord of Caves Imperial Executioner  PMachinist  PFrost Mage  PSoul Hunter  P Only thing he does is heal his ult minimal dmgDeath Mage  P Key is to do the freeze animation with death mage first followed by IE Mach FM and finally Soul Hunter. Mach should then use his laser to finish the boss before he goes underground again.Raged Blood  Iron Hoof  P hired Soul Hunter  PDeath Knight  P hiredDisease Bringer  P hired Chaplain  P This one is straight forwards really just survive until the end.

I am also recently TL and every time I see FD I bust out my horseriding halberdequipped heroine. Her ult cannot miss or be dodged as well as having the unique quality of ignoring clones.

6111602,0,t3_3z6ett,On my server most people run FD IE and TF as  core members. Many run VS and NA aswell as QoC. DB is also used a lot because he can steal FDs clone and make himself stronger also he deals alot of damage if you have a sturdy frontline like TF. Ive rarely seen AS maybe in some GA comps. HN sure has its uses but NA comps usually takes her down before she can ult. This is information from my sever TL and Im rank  in arena rank  in GA.,Heroes_Charge,cykbrfm,1,t5_342t6

7120335,0,t1_d1ngr6l,Well your only options are  which I assume are all either dead or filled with top level players.You can choose Switch Servers to take a look at any other server as a brand new player. This will let you scope out the arena leaders see the guild activity find out about the players etc. Then if you like it you can pay to Server Migrate. My guess is that if youre on  the first  servers are going to be very similar to what youre experiencing there.,Heroes_Charge,d1nhvzr,1,t5_342t6
8093143,0,t1_d4og1a8,Im TL. Havent seen her used on my server since early s where people got her Legendary but she still felt lackluster. Look at the other tank options TF DW CK DK Griff Com DV. Why would you invest into her when other tanks do more damage as well as being more tanky? Her legendary gives HP bonus to the original heroes which you also never use. So its pretty garbage.

8617796,0,t3_4xvpzr,Just use what youve got until you get replacements. Sniper sucks horribly so dump him as soon as possible. Similarly Wind Master and Succubus are nothing to write home about so ifwhen you start pulling heroes from gold chests or Crusade you can probably replace them. Commander is good though and Chaplain.PK is straight garbage but he starts off at  so hes useable for the time being. Id rather have literally any other hero at  though.
