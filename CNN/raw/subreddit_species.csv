173988,0,t1_cey1bqq,These are not species they are hybrid phalaenopsis that are many generations separated from their wild ancestors. They are massproduced in Asian tissue culture labs grown up for a year or two shipped to the US where they are induced to flower and dumped into big box stores. These ones were simply established on a suitable tree.Once theyve lost their tag theres no way to tell what these complex hybrids are. Some are popular for a few months or so but they come and go and many are very similar. There are  hybrid orchids with tens of thousands of hybrid phalaenopsis out there.The tree could be a banyan not all of them are full of aerial roots but pictures of the overall morphology and a closeup of the leaves would be useful.,species,cey90rm,3,t5_2s5s1

1284039,0,t3_28slws,I would say a caddisfly larvae. They actually build a protective hermit crab like housing that they carry with them so it very well could be a stick one made into a home. ,species,cie2keg,3,t5_2s5s1

5560731,0,t3_3r8lyo,these are pretty rare these days. a lot more common back in pioneer days. it could make a snack of your pit bull. the next step up from a fisher would be a wolverine.,species,cwmcyfs,5,t5_2s5s1
6154082,0,t1_cyoviyr,I doubt it. Cetacean teeth are curved at the top almost hooked. And the root doesnt end up blunt but hollow. In the OPs case we can clearly see that there is no opening and the general shape is almost oval and smooth. ,species,cyp5l8w,1,t5_2s5s1

7871153,0,t3_4n4tzr,To add to this. I made this photo today somewhere off the coast of Spain in the Mediterranean sea. I go paddle boarding nearly daily there and have seen pretty much everything there is to see in this area but Ive never seen anything like this weird red thing.There were  as you can see.

9895641,0,t3_5h2n9l,Pretty sure its either the Plate limpet Lottia scutum or the Shield limpet Lottia pelta  the two are really hard to tell apart with a live limpet since you cant see the inside of the shell.,species,daxfc57,1,t5_2s5s1
10334461,0,t1_dcf9u4e,Do you live with anyone? Parents or grandparents? If so theyre moving them. These are indeed operculums also known as cat eye seashells and they are not alive. Someone thinks its funny to fool you with a silly story. ,species,dcfgw13,6,t5_2s5s1
