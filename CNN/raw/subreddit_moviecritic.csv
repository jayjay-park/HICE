454057,0,t3_1z9gbv,I thought the movie started out great but at the  minute mark or so. I think it kinda fell down hard and went from being a nice satire based movie to hitting on too many standard tropes that you would get in a standard animated movie.,moviecritic,cfrvigr,0,t5_2qwz7

If youre looking for a debate on this sort of thing maybe make a post on rTiADiscussion with a link to your thing and maybe explaining your argument a bit more in the text post and let the good folks there do the debatin. Theyve got the same position as I do on this sort of thing so their arguments are as good as mine. ,moviecritic,cjo990f,5,t5_2qwz7

2706828,0,t1_cn8fiiw,I admire the simplicity of films like Blade. What annoys me about The Raid is how little it offers. Yes the action is well done but it is just action. People are flung at Rama endlessly just for him to dispatch them rinse and repeat. I just couldnt deal with how little it had to offer for the entire run time what especially upset me was how good the start was.In my opinion watch the sequel. It is far better.,moviecritic,cnbr89i,2,t5_2qwz7

3134851,0,t3_2v8yq2,I saw this today and was trying to describe it to a friend. It had been a long time since Id watched SpongeBob nor am I sure I analyzed it quite to the degree that the video reviewer did. I was disappointed that the movie was misrepresented and out of water was only a small part of the movie. It was also kind of weird in that SpongeBob came out not really having any true friends despite being loyal to his friends the only one to attempt to come to the rescue and eventually save the day. Even Patrick in a dramatic apocalyptic episode turned on him. I guess as someone whod spent a large period of time away from the cartoon I was disappointed that the characters hadnt matured or developed. As cartoons go though it is a bit of a dash amp dine.  ,moviecritic,comxah7,1,t5_2qwz7
