7169047,0,t1_d1r2fql,Hi there! I also have a newish baby  months and if I could go back to my  week PP self I would say . stop eating sugar super easy way to not hold onto weight . drink more water . walk a few minutes every day. It took me until about  months for my body to feel fully recovered my joints were still hypermobile and walking too much and too fast made my sacrum back and groin hurt. Anyway thats the advice I would give myself hope it helps you some.,TeamPollen,d1t1xln,1,t5_3dws9

7705202,0,t3_4kv65b,I fit into some nice jeans lucky brand! on the first try! When I went to the store I was convinced I am about a size  waist and the sales woman was like I dont think so I think the  would fit you and it sure as hell does! But that was  weeks ago. Now those  jeans are starting to feel a little bit looser! I m so excited,TeamPollen,d3i13ih,2,t5_3dws9
