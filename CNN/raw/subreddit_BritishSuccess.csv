The police literally know every single gun I have  there is no option but to hand them in and as such comply with the law and not increase gun crime. If handguns are illegal then it is also normally illegal to carry around an imitation handgun And I didnt mean legal owners I meant people who after the ban acquire guns which were once legal illegally. gtThe people who will own a handgun illegally would criminals would have owned them illegally before Without licence But when guns are illegal it is more difficult to acquire black market guns. gtThis shows we can have both legal and lower gun crime than now does it not?Ah right yes I agree with that. I just dont think its a sensible route to go at the moment with the state the countries in.The only downside as far as Im concerened is the impact it has on hobbyists and sportsmen. As far as Im aware people who need guns for their line of work excluding hitmen etc obviously lol can acquire guns.

His concern was that he didnt know if the British pasteurization was good enough so if we didnt have any American cheese theyd leave it.  Not Monteray Jack.  Not Stinking Bishop.  American Cheese.  Only missing the word product before it has all the character of a construction material.Sadly I watched those hungry children walk away from their induction into the rich exciting world of cheese with more personality than the generic block of curdled fats they were so excited about inventing they named it after the continent it was on and went back to sharpening pencils.,BritishSuccess,cjaxvc0,15,t5_2vlyo

2188198,0,t1_clhvrbb,I remember one time I worked the kiosk and store policy at the time was that no items could be taken at the kiosk. One day when it was quite busy I noticed a lady in the queue with a basket of shopping so told her that I was unable to take the items and that she would need to go to a checkout with her still queueing I thought it was best to tell her before she got to the counter.But Ive a train to catch in ten minutes says she. So I reiterated that it was store policy plus I noticed that she also had some items that wouldve needed weighing so told her that even if I could take the items I wouldnt be able to weigh those items. BY this time shes reached the counter  I was still serving people and only speaking to her when waiting for either the till or the lottery machine to catch up with what I was doing.So she then decides to give up and just leave the store. Dont worry she didnt steal anything that I was aware of  quite the opposite. She put the basket on the side of the counter that wasnt used emptied the basket item by item onto the counter top then puts the basket on the floor and walks out.Both me and the remaining few customers in line just stared blankly at the items on the counter for a moment or two before the next customer said What was her problem then? If she had a train to catch in ten minutes what was she doing here anyway?... the nearest station being a parkway station about  miles away from the town it was named after and in which the supermarket I worked was in.,BritishSuccess,clhz1nb,3,t5_2vlyo

You raise an important issue which is the need to protect minorities from majority oppression. But that is exactly what we risk when we provide mechanisms for suppressing ideas by force by people being able to declare things as hate speech.The Brazilian politician in your example was absolutely within his rights to express his stupid views.. and people are within their rights to judge him for them or to support him on that. What the right to free speech doesnt grant him however is the right to use that speech to manifest those views. He shouldnt have been convicted of hate speech for saying hateful things he should have been convicted of abuse of power once he tried to use his authority to suppress the rights of others.Can you see the distinction? .. the liberal position is that people need to have the right to express ideas but they do not have the right to execute those ideas and especially not to impose those views on others. If we decide that we are going to be able to tell each other what we can and cant say we end up in a very dangerous situation.

For example if they have run out of regular Spaghetti Bolognese ready meals they might substitute a Finest or Select or whatever one instead or if they run out of value soap they might send regular etc. The good news is you only pay the cost of what you originally bought. Sometimes the substitution staff make wild substitutions like this or the occasional rude one where when someone ordered condoms they got a cucumber or lube instead. ,BritishSuccess,dg136d8,46,t5_2vlyo
