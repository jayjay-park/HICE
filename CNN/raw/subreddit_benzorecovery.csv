9194440,0,t1_d8hfdne,i wouldnt expect much from  days other than return of symptoms and possibly amplification of them for a few days or week or two maybe. if anything does come up or start to come up if it was me i would sporadically take . less and less frequently until you stop max maybe two weeks?,benzorecovery,d8hgoi1,1,t5_31r5h
9412869,0,t1_d98ytvg,Yeah I heard B vitamins get depleted during withdrawl from a naturalpath told me this  so a B complex I take but still nothing.   I feel like Im sleep walking and legs are going to collapse if I walk too long.   Theirs a cortisol test that I can take  but I kind of already know im fucked so why spend hundreds of bucks to get confirmed. Wondering when these windows will start showing like everyone talks about..tired of waiting. ,benzorecovery,d995aud,1,t5_31r5h
9973428,0,t3_5hktaj,Start with mg. Thats where I started and Im now at .mg after taking off .mg every  days. If you still feel really anxious on mg try adding .mg until you feel baseline. Thats your starting point.,benzorecovery,db7kcgz,1,t5_31r5h
