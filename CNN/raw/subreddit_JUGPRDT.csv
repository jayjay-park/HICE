11256118,0,t1_df7uscm,Ah I see. I read in control as in a control deck. So yeah obviously this is a control card a card for control decks it specifically helps control against aggro and control decks dont chose who trades into their taunt since they usually dont have board control.

11262129,0,t3_60qr67,Out of the options revealed I cant really see a time when youd pick Invocation of Earth unless youre needing the spawns to which why not use Onyxia instead doubt the  mana and  reduction matters too much for you.Which leaves Air Water and Fire Air  to all enemy minions is a nice option in general highroll Lightning Storm is always nice to have at a whim. Good choice if face damage isnt an issue or youre relatively healthy. Water  health for your hero can help save you in a pinch with that facetargeted Greater Healing Potion. Could see play in MidrangeControl Shaman for this effect alone. Fire  to enemy hero is an okay catchall. Its like when you casually play Ragnaros on an empty board only more balanced since it only targets face.Considering Shamans abundant Elemental presence already I dont see how this card wouldnt be played as the top end of a deck that needs a top end.

11265547,0,t3_60sa4a,I actually really love this new Elemental mechanic as it allows for so much more interactivity in the game. A  mana  taunt with divine shield is strong but having to broadcast the intent of playing it to your opponent a turn beforehand and the fact that it is weak as a reaction card creates a much more dynamic play experience hopefully.,JUGPRDT,df8xm1g,2,t5_3jah4

11294939,0,t3_6174ih,So what I get from this is that to guess what card was in the deck at the start of the game. So this makes it important to remember what cards your opponent plays at what turn so you have a higher chance of guessing the right card.,JUGPRDT,dfc9jun,2,t5_3jah4

11298330,0,t1_dfclxln,Why wouldnt you play a good weapon without rng then?  Warrior already has access to Fiery War Axe Arcanite Reaper and Gorehowl.  In the case of the Doomhammer  upgrade example keep in mind that Doomhammer  upgrade deals  damage over  turns and so does Arcanite Reaper  upgrade although you can stretch out the damage more with Doomhammer.  Also youd probably have to choose to play this card over other weapons because else you could end up with a lot of weapon redundancy in your deck.  For control warrior this doesnt offer enough value to choose over Gorehowl and the Fiery War Axes for the earlier stages of the game.  gt and if you get one you dont like you just have to wait a turn.    This is a double sided coin though you HAVE to play a good weapon the turn you get it which might collide with your other plays else it might be Cursed Blade next turn.,JUGPRDT,dfcnd30,9,t5_3jah4
11300265,0,t3_618tvl,As a FP btw player I hate that this is an epic considering its probably going to be a tech card that youd play quite a bit in an aggro meta which seems like itll live on.,JUGPRDT,dfcv9oa,2,t5_3jah4
11302914,0,t1_dfcldj7,Id argue its better than Shifter since theres way fewer weapons than minions most are at least ok and most weapons are cheap Gorehowl and Gladiators Longbow are the only two standard weapons that cost more than Id also say its better than Blingtron as you get to decide what weapon you get when you play it never get a cursed blade and it doesnt give your opponent a weapon so you dont run the risk of Gorehowl druids. Also Pirate warriors would run more Firey War Axes and Arcanite Reapers if they could and Molten Blade gives them a chance to do so. Pirate Warriors also would probably run Hammer of Twilight Doomhammer TrueSilver Champion and maybe Posioned Blade Perdition Blade Stormforged Axe and maybe a few others Im not thinking of. Also if it works like Shifter it makes cards like Hobart Grapplehammer and Grimestreet Pawnbroker slightly more consistent. Id be surprised if this isnt played.,JUGPRDT,dfd62ul,2,t5_3jah4
11304198,0,t1_dfcz07c,Miracle wont look the same anymore either. Dont forget that. They lose Cold Blood Azure Drake and Tomb Pillager. All are pretty important staples in Miracle. Also why cant Rogue capitalize on a minion? And I was going to comment on your thought that if Assassinate is too slow why would they run this but I think you might have figured that out while typing your response.  Mana removal vs  mana removal  dude isnt really a fair comparison. If its the same spell with a significant body attached its not the same at all. You more or less maintain tempo with Assasinate. With Vilespine you actually gain tempo. Thats a huge difference because Rogue is a class based on tempo plays.,JUGPRDT,dfdbbbg,1,t5_3jah4

11309567,0,t1_dfcnuzq,I feel like the paladin quest will probably have something to do with adapting or summoning larger minions rather than tokens. I get the feeling that they want the two class legendaries to fit into different archetypes for most classes although warlock has been an exception and the paladin legendary minion seems more geared towards summoning a lot of silverhand recruits. ,JUGPRDT,dfdx7lf,1,t5_3jah4
