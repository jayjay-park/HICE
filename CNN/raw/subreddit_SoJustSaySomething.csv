260772,0,t3_1x23s8,Just get over it having a facebook account isnt a big deal its like refusing to get an email account or a phone. Just because you have one doesnt mean you have to friend everyone youve ever said hi to include all your personal info or that you have to participate with any of the bullshit that goes on with facebook or even post anything. I only signed up to be able to better communicate with some people and it works out great. I only have people i actually care about on my page and have no issues ignoring or blocking their stupid post if necessary. It doesnt have to be a source of exciting or a way to water down socializing  its just another way to communicate with people in your life. Also if you really dont want to have one then dont have one your friends will get over it.,SoJustSaySomething,cf7sdoa,1,t5_2whrj
266598,0,t3_1x5mpz,Please dont waste your time on a douchebag girl. Something great is for you to have a GOAL ... This will get your mind off her and will make you better and take you out of this slump youre in. Take a course or lift weights get out there. Also always give off positive energy... Eventually people get tired of trying to cheer up a person whos always negative. So spend time alone and figure yourself out and make yourself better  before trying to always hang out with others. My point is  no one wants to be around someone whos always negative or sad. ..So get yourself a goal and focus only on that! Forget her ! Send me a message if youd like,SoJustSaySomething,cf8e5bs,3,t5_2whrj

906361,0,t3_24hm21,Professional sports organizations seem to be exempt from the rules that all other businesses have to follow. Im pretty sure that in California you have to have consent to record and share someones private conversation. Which means that his girlfriend illegally recorded and shared what he said in private and reasonably expected to stay private. Hes absolutely free to be racist in his own home and in private. If the NBA can force him out for being privately racist could they force someone out for being Jewish? Or for being gay? Just because its not a popular opinion doesnt mean he doesnt have the right to have his own opinion in private. Hes never done or said anything racist in an official capacity as owner. Shit most of his players are black. ,SoJustSaySomething,ch7b4qi,6,t5_2whrj
