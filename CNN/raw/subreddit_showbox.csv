7443649,0,t3_4h8ir1,Yeah same with me. Download wait for a few seconds took approx an hour. luckily a friend told me about cinema box so Im on that now. Not as sophisticated as showbox but good enough. Im sure showbox will sort it out eventually. ,showbox,d2oandj,2,t5_34c06

7514617,0,t3_4i993v,Im pretty sure its VLC Player. Theres a VlcPlayerActivity and other VLC stuff in the smali code. I doubt if the standalone version has this ip sharing functionality..If you want to watch a D movie from for instance MegaBox HD on your TV you can share the streamurl in MX Player by pressing the menu button and then Tools and then Share. The url will be too long to type in manually but you could use an url shortener app to fix that. Just a thought.. ,showbox,d2wdht5,1,t5_34c06

8551773,0,t3_4ws4bd,Adjusting timing only works if the subtitles are offset with the video but they play at same speed. If they arent at the same speed then it wont work. My app can cast and change timing however I dont know if it works with showbox any more. If you want to give it a try and you still have the same issue then I would gladly look at the subtitle file and tell you what the issue might be. ,showbox,d6ajm8q,1,t5_34c06

9777644,0,t1_dahobl8,If I understand correctly you would like to have Show Box with the interface of FSHD VideoBox. Im sorry but I cant do that. Im not a developer I cant even modify FSHD VideoBox because somehow Im not able to recompile it. Sorry man but I cant help you. I also have an Android box but Im using a mouse to control it.
