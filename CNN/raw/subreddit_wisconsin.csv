247342,0,t3_1wxjhl,Its funny because high property taxes are exactly why my parents retired to Wyoming.   The interesting thing is that if the workplace pay was higher with a more robust economy they wouldnt have retired early and left. In fact if there were better jobs with better pay then general tax would cover them better because more money would have been coming in to the state coffers. My father had an interesting take on it all though.   When he was a Council Member of a small town here in Wisconsin he would tell me that when the national level cuts spending the bill goes to the states to make up the shortfall.   When the state cuts spending the bill falls to the counties to make up the shortfall. Make no mistake about it we will pay.  The only difference is we get the bill while the politicians slap each other on the back telling everyone what a great job they have done.

572021,0,t1_cg4xdez,I know it was a smarmy answer but let me at this one....My wife and I worked as Sunday School teachers for the Catholic Church and went through some amazing seminars on how to protect kids and what to watch for with warning signs. As a parent now I am really fortunate to have seen them. That being said predators often try to put themselves close to children.   That could be a teacher a coach or a dance instructor. Just being around kids with little oversight from another adult was a modus operandi. The thing with priests were a few fold.   First you were put into priesthood young historically.  You were there for life. You were in a brotherhood which could lead to covering up evidence.   But the biggest issue is the the church believed in policing itself.  If a priest was caught fondling a child having sex with a woman or engaging in sex with another man it was delt with by moving the priest to more scholarly duties dont let him near people in general.,wisconsin,cg5akzn,3,t5_2qrc2

1361926,0,t1_cimzho3,Emergency vehicles have sirens and lights because they require a clear path as they are responding to an emergency.  You on the other hand are just a person on a motorcycle so theres no exigent reason for being louder than a standard exhaust.You can just as easily be noticed by wearing a kit with higher visibility colors and having your lights on.  Or does that also infringe on something somehow?Ambulance sirens are dB.  Maximum level for stock motorcycle is dB.  The decibel scale is logarithmic and Im not a mathematician but the db rating difference actually means the ambulance siren is considerably louder practically exponentially so than a motorcycle with the normal exhaust and muffler.The cabin noise in a passenger car with the windows up and no radio at  mph is around  dB plus or minus a few depending on the makemodel.  So it stands to reason that the  dB rating difference between cabin noise in a passenger vehicle and that of a nearby motorcycle is plenty sufficient to be heard.  Add a radio to that noise and theres a different calculation to determine noise level from combined sources even so that radio would have to be very loud to overcome the  dB permitted on a motorcycle.  The person in that car with a radio that loud is not an attentive driver  but weve already addressed that there are inattentive operators of all kinds.  Adding more noise only results in escalating the situation.Above  dB you can get lasting hearing damage from less than  hours of exposure.  Above  is considered painful and falls into the Deafening category  prolonged exposure for more than a minute can cause hearing loss.Added  Explain precisely why your bike should be allowed to be nearly as as or louder than an emergency vehicle.,wisconsin,cin09i2,0,t5_2qrc2

When Johnson joined Congress he was facing a long term projection for decreasing federal debt ratios even if the various trust funds were exhausted and the programs continued to pay out in full regardless.

2192359,0,t3_2k73p9,gt Just over  percent of the  students who entered the statewide program this year attended a public school last year the data showed. Over the two years of the program just under  percent of those receiving a voucher came from a public school. ampgt To qualify for a voucher a single parent with three children can earn up to  per year. For a married couple with two children the cutoff is  annually. Once in the program families no longer need to meet the income requirements.I just dont understand how someone can support this blatant attempt to privatize the education system. The data shows that this program already isnt working in the way it was suppose to help students escape poorly performing public schools.

2270928,0,t1_clrpzln,Im not sure that I agree with hurting our most economically distressed citizens to make a statement to the federal government.  I think that is an argument that sounds great until you are actually impacted.  As for rejecting HSR money California and Ohio are thanking us.  They have the added benefit to jobs created construction and permanent and a piece of infrastructure that will last for many generations.  Think of if we would have rejected the interstate system...Further rejecting the HSR money caused us to get sued by Talgo.  The cost of the suit would have paid for the HSR to run and be  maintained for  years.  And we lost the trainsets that we already paid for.Speaking of money Walker threw away the state had begun working on a local healthcare exchange before Walker took office.  This included the procurement of servers employment of IT staff and set up of the site.  Everything was nearly in place before Walker rejected the money.  What did this mean for us?  We had to pay for this rather than being reimbursed from the feds.  And we didnt get our own exchange and had to suffer through Healthcare.gov.  All of this to make a political point.Im quite frankly tired of the political grandstanding.

2449826,0,t1_cme2phk,I think we all agree on the camera principle. I think most officers would agree as well as it protects them. In this case if Wilson truly was justified in the shooting Ill bet hes wishing somebody got it on film in order to clear his name. And its pretty clear we all wish we had the full story.As far as the case itself Ive been hearing a different side of that. Ive been hearing that cases similar to this often dont even go to Grand Jury and that Eric Holder insisted that it go to grand jury. If thats the case then I would not be surprised that it didnt go to trial. Under normal circumstances meaning without the racial overtones the evidence is pretty clear and a grand jury would not even be needed.From what Ive been hearing many more eye witness accounts the DNA evidence in the vehicle and the autopsy reports all confirm that Brown had an altercation with officer Wilson through the window. That alone is not OK. Thats an attempt to assault a police officer. Then he began to walk away but upon officer Wilson exiting the car to pursue him he charged back at Officer Wilson and was not cooperating. He came after him in a violent manner and Wilson was afraid he was not going to be able to contain him properly. After a few warning shots Brown continued to pursue officer Wilson.Based on that evidence this seems like a slam dunk case to me. Even if it went to trial does anybody really believe wed get sufficient evidence to charge Officer Wilson of anything? I dont. The evidence to the contrary was pretty convincing.,wisconsin,cmei36m,6,t5_2qrc2

2546297,0,t1_cmqsddo,The biggest practical difference  the Medicaid expansion yea or nay  isnt a part of Obamacare.  That was opened up by the SCOTUS ruling that the Obamacare requirement that states accept expansion in order to keep existing Federal Medicaid monies was unconstitutionally coercive since the states would have to start paying for a part of the expansion from  up to  in  and beyond.The whole thing was set up that Medicaid expansion would cover everyone in the country up to  of the federal poverty level and those with incomes above that without insurance from other sources could use the exchanges.  When the SCOTUS ruled that states be given the option on Medicaid expansion it actually revealed a drafting error in the law in early versions a bone thrown to Blue Dogs was to have those from  of the FPL be given the choice of Medicaid or to go to the exchanges for private insurance.  That was abandoned but the part where exchange subsidies were available from  of the FPL was not updated.  That item was moot in the final passage since the  bracket were to have Medicaid or nothing but it was revealed again by the SCOTUS ruling.  That drafting error is why the  bracket can get subsidies at all in nonexpansion states.,wisconsin,cmqxrvh,4,t5_2qrc2

Basically it means that Unions cant force you to join. This gives the Unions less money and ideally eventually starves them out of existence making for a more globally competitive workplace. It also has a nice side effect politically in that it lowers the amount of money Democrats get since Unions have less money when people arent forced to pay them while giving Republicans more money since owners are able to save money in things like mandatory raises and paying to deal with the Unions on other fronts.I should note that Im all for public funding for elections so this can turn into a nonissue. Until that happens though it would be silly to not take every chance possible to weaken your enemy. Democrats are doing it with attempts to overturn Citizens United.

3352552,0,t1_cpae3l7,gtIt is the officers job to be a hero for the law abiding public not for the violent criminals that attack the officers and the law abiding public. If youre going to be a hero and Im using it as shorthand for the virtuous person then youre a hero in all situations. Now what being a hero requires varies depending on the context but bravery in the face of danger is one such element. Further protecting criminals from themselves and the byproducts of the crimes is a component of the police officers duty morally at the least. They can survive but they also must fulfill their duty. As such the One must survive comes as a last consideration. Further unless the criminal is actively pursuing the cop most survival claims fail as fleeing would also allow for survival. Just surviving includes retreat in most situations. As such any claim of they must kill to survive would be false if they could survive and flee. Now if there is another consideration at work which overrides the survival then that is the dutytask of officer and not survival.gtBy the reasoning it is never permissible for police officers to us lethal force. Do you also think they shouldnt respond to active shooters? It is permissible for all other options would be hopeless. That is its morally permissible and hopefully legally when the officer has no recourse but to kill the person. That said its still a failure to maintain the peace so the officer or probably more aptly the department failed to perform their duties.  gtThey are called lesslethal responses. It is not the moral duty of a police officer to be a pacifist their purpose is to maintain law and order.     But Im not claiming that they must be a pacifist. So your particular challenge is confused at best.    But to clarify their job is to maintain law and order. Part of maintaining law and order is preservation of the life of moral persons i.e. beings who have such capacities as that being qualifies as moral considerations moral persons here does not make value judgments of that beings actions. The killing of a person for any reason is a failure to maintain law and order. Hence law and order is not maintained and the police officers duty is unfulfilled should that officer kill a person.     Of course they may be reasons not to blame the officer for the failing. They may have failed their duty but only because of a countervailing duty mitigates the former but there still is a failing.,wisconsin,cpaez2s,-2,t5_2qrc2

Rural WI is dying and if Im a betting man at an increased rate year over year.  The towns that should really be worried are the exurbs.  Towns in those weird areas between the larger cities that live of the economic engines of those larger urban areas.  Towns like Oconomowoc Port Washington Portage West Bend Burlington Watertown etc... maybe not those specific towns but hopefully you get what I mean.  Those towns are not viable without very inexpensive transportation fuel costs which can be fleeting.  You have an entire generation that doesnt view cars as anything other than a burden and they simply wont live in those areas if they can avoid it.There will always be a need to support agricultural operations so there will always be a network of smaller towns rooted in Ag but if trends continue the way they are Millennials want nothing to do with the suburbs and exurbs those exurban towns are going to have a really hard time sustaining themselves.Long term this is bad news for WI conservatives.  Their power base is rural and suburban old and white.  Demographically those are all things in decline.  They really cant gerrymander any more extremely than they did in  so they need to figure out how theyre going to deal with that demographic shift.Its sad to see this State in an accelerating decline especially since it doesnt have to be nearly as severe as it is but so it goes.

The perspective of the tax credit then is that the two events  the expansion of the MF facility and the closing of the Watertown PCB manufacturing facility  are unrelated and therefore the latter is not relevant in determining whether Eaton should have received the credit.  The tax credit perspective would be that were the credits not received not only would the PCB manufacturer would have been closed anyways but the MF facility wouldnt have expanded either.Is that a poorly constructed tax credit?

4389453,0,t1_cskeq5w,Yes it was the primary issue. What Im trying to say though is for many Confederate soldiers it was about more than that. It had to be. There is no way the south gets enough support to develop an army and put up a good fight for succession because of a power trip over slaves. Im just trying to demonstrate that it represented a resistance to the push for Central federal government need based geopolitical differences. And while they were obviously on the wrong side of history its interesting to think about what it meant to their economy. So when you take the morality of slavery out of the picture you realize that slaves were a major resource so to speak. Then its then not unlike rural counties in Wisconsin being upset by a larger city like Madison thinking they know what rural life is like. Especially if Madison were to rule that for example combines are dangerous and need to be banned. Rural Wisconsin would fight tooth and nail because their economy and their livelihoods are tightly knitted to that resource. Again obviously there are stark differences in morality and basic human rights.In other words Id be willing to bet that if you asked  Confederate soldiers what they were fighting for a few would say slavery  but the majority would say because life is different down here and the north doesnt understand our needs. That message while still influenced by slavery would resonate more with people. So they would say they are fighting because their state wants to run their own state.Obviously since slavery was the primary driver of the succession movement historians will use that explanation. But that doesnt mean it was that simple that black and white no pun intended.,wisconsin,cskfeiv,1,t5_2qrc2

4953055,0,t1_cuiuvql,Interesting. However I read the short drugabuse.gov link and the top saysgt Early exposure to cannabinoids in adolescent rodents decreases the reactivity of brain dopamine reward centers later in adulthood. To the extent that these findings generalize to humans this could help explain early marijuana initiates increased vulnerability for drug abuse and addiction to other substances of abuse later in life that has been reported by most epidemiological studies. ... These findings are consistent with the idea of marijuana as a gateway drug. So what Im getting is pretty much any any substance that has an influence on the brain nicotine alcohol drugs has the possibility to push people to do harder substances because they want to still feel that high. However the second part that you quoted pretty much says to me its still the human factor and its a wash because there are findings for both ways.,wisconsin,cuivfe9,-1,t5_2qrc2

But  this guy rants and raves about how they were only fined  billion dollars and its only a bump in the road because they make  billion in revenue. Bullshit right there. Thats  months worth of revenue for chase bank. About  months worth of what would have been net income. And for a publicly held company that really takes a hit over the longterm as well in terms of shareholder confidence.

6723891,0,t1_d0eqlg1,Actually no they arent.For the survey as a whole N   which is very normal for a Marquette poll.  For p  . questions then you would expect the percentage standard deviation to be about pqn  . so the  error  confidence level usually quoted in polls to be about ..What then happens for the headline here is that N is reduced to the  who say they plan to vote in the Democratic Primary.  That makes the  confidence level ..It is instead . because the  are not a random sample of Democratic Primary voters but rather they are taken from the X many white people plus Y black people plus Z others and P men and Q women etc etc of the original  surveyed whose proportions likely do not match those known to exist in the population as a whole from Census data etc.  The raw numbers are then weighted  raked the net effect of which is to increase the error bars slightly.For example say you sampled  people and know that the population is  menwomen and got results from  men and  women just as a matter of statistical happenstance.  You then have to weight the result so that those  men represent  men in the end result and those  women so that they represent  women bit more complicated than that when there are multiple demographics but this is the gist of it.  Cramming  results into  makes the result for a quoted  men more statistically accurate than it would at first appear for N   but this is more than offset by the inaccuracy produced by expanding  womens answers to represent those of .If you read the Marquette crosstabs you can see that the  Democratic Primary voters are in fact . Democratic Primary voters as a result of the demographic weighting that is done.,wisconsin,d0et4fu,8,t5_2qrc2

7073588,0,t1_d1i1c8v,TLDR it probably includes them.If you read the detailed survey results you can see that N reduces at each question so the N  for question  about Trump v Clinton is being answered by those who got through the previous  questions.For how they chose who to call they have . million Wisconsin Republicans in their voter file probably from getting the registered voter list and either matching it with lists that the Republican Party uses for GotV or other indicators of Republican leanings such as a model based on magazine subscription data demographics neighborhood etc modeling their turnout likelihood and picking the  their model says are the most likely to turn out they dont say what  chance of turning out this corresponds to taking the  of those who have landlines then based upon average interview response rates they pull up enough of these to get age amp sex demographics corresponding to  turnout and a  interview minimum for each congressional district.  I dont see anything about it excluding moderates from the sample.One interesting omission is that they dont show a screening question for whether the person actually plans to vote in the Republican Presidential Primary rather than confirming that their information and model are both good for this interviewee they just launch right into the TrumpKasichCruz question having established that theyre talking to its automated the person they expect.  Its possible that they just omitted that step from the reporting as being redundant but seeing how careful they are about recording N at each stage I would be somewhat surprised if they did.Another is that I dont see any indications that the TrumpKasichCruz question rotated the names.  You can see this polling best practice in Marquettes polling instrument ROTATE CANDIDATE NAMES  theres a small but noticeable effect of the ordering upon polling results presumably because the first name read can monopolize your brain into thinking about them and less about the subsequent names.So there are a couple of key assumptions in there notably that the demographics of the  turnout will be similar to those from  that their turnout model is good and that  will turn out.  That last one seems to be at odds with the GABs estimate of . million in total k seems to be a tad on the low side in that context especially given that  showed up in  and that GOP primary turnout has been significantly up so far in  vs ,wisconsin,d1i5kol,3,t5_2qrc2

From the second hyperlinked articlegtThe offer which involves some public funds is a tacit acknowledgment of agricultures role in polluted wells in the region. But experts have said that farms are not the sole source of contamination in a county where nearly  of the wells tested over a year period showed unsafe levels of bacteria and or nitrates.  gtThe key part of this program is that it kicks in whether it appears as if its from E. coli from agricultural practices or not said dairy farmer Don Niles who is also a veterinarian. It doesnt have to come from agriculture.  gtMark A. Borchardt a microbiologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture who has been conducting well studies in the county said there is evidence that contamination is coming from agricultural and nonagricultural sources such as septic systems.tldr The Farm Group did not admit to tainting drinking water but is going to help pay some of the costs of private water treatment systems even though a government expert says that some of the contamination is coming from nonagricultural sources.If the farmers are not  responsible for the contamination they should not have to pay  of the costs to treat the water.,wisconsin,d7zae8g,9,t5_2qrc2

9399654,0,t1_d97dtna,I guess I find it hard to understand why its unfair?Piece together the information we have. The UWGB polling location experienced heavy traffic and long lines on election day during the PRIMARY. Now Wisconsin did have one of the highest turnouts during the primary season this year. However its still significantly lower than Wisconsins turnout in presidential general elections somewhere around  again one of the highest in the country. Its easy to then conclude the UWGB polling location will again be dominated by long lines and waits. Students of all affiliations recognizing this as an issue request to make UWGB an early polling location for the general election. This will resolve some issues with wait times on election day and afford some students the opportunity to vote who otherwise wouldnt have it. Given that many students probably lack proper transportation or the available time to make it to city all during operating hours it makes sense to operate early voting hours at this polling location. If we saw similar issues at a predominately conservative polling location long lines and waits on election day making it an undue burden to vote then it wouldnt be unfair to place an early voting location there either.Madison has early voting locations at both the UW and Edgewood to alleviating student voting issues on election day and no one has batted an eye at that being unfair,wisconsin,d97h03j,5,t5_2qrc2

They state they are not like anything anyone has ever seen and claim to be digital specialists yet their best idea is to spend thousands to put up a billboard in a town that already has a history of voting against Ryan... and make vulgar buttons. Why not use the money to fund digital marketing or social media campaign with their self stated sophisticated digital expertise and massive experience with field operations. Why not use the money to help set up protests you could help transport people and market support with the money. Have they even ever set up a meeting with Ryan? Any official political discussion with himself or his office? Nothing on the site lends itself to any evidence of this. Remember this is the group that made Fuck Paul Ryan buttons and thought it was a good idea in efforts to effect change. Its not my job to decide how they spend money but I sure as hell have every right to vet and criticize any organization thats asking me for donations. I think the group wastes money hasnt done anything of significance and is fairly childish. You have every right to disagree and the beauty is that neither of us are right or wrong.Have a great day homie. ,wisconsin,deii8mr,10,t5_2qrc2

I choose pay about  more a year to buy eggs directly from a farmer so I know that the chickens are humanely raised. I know everyone does not have that luxury but this effort was designed to point out the bad eggs so everyone could make an informed choice in the grocery store. It would have almost certainly raised the bar on chicken care since no one wants to have their brand connected to abused chickens. ,wisconsin,demdle2,8,t5_2qrc2

11164530,0,t3_5zcu1g,Seletion Committee wants that Nova v Wisconsin Matchup in Second. Money runs the NCAA. They know us Wisco people will travel plus in my opinion we could beat Nova base on Matchups problems. Wouldnt the NCAA get a lot of talk about that upset? So these are the type of matchups the NCAA want because they drive the money. This same logic of Big Schools playing each other can be spotted. A potential UCLA vs Kentucky in the round of  will be the most talked about game untill the championship. They want this matchup so why shouldnt the commitee make it happen as soon as possible giving their restrictions on seeding.But on Wisconsin I think we are better than  but we definitely played like  seed the last couple of weeks in the Season so  is fine with me.

11576202,0,t1_dg7ykm5,American voters picked Hillary by about  votes. Not sure that means they wanted a political outsider.Whats the stat about Hillarys winning margin?  Its more votes than were cast in about  states? EDIT  Even leaving aside possible foreign interference on our elections by Russia Trump was handed the presidency by an antiquated institution created by our Founding Fathers the Electoral College.

When asked  as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was in her confirmation hearing  whether he believed in using standards of proficiency versus growth to measure student achievement he  like DeVos  was unable to differentiate between the two. gtYoure getting into some pretty esoteric educational pedagogy he told the student who asked the question.
