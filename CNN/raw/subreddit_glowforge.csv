5230237,0,t1_cvgeos6,gt The feedable bed would have been nice but since I dont have an explicit need for it at this time it didnt seem worth the extra price.Same here. I really want passthrough but the other Pro features will need to be much better explained before I can live with double the price. Better optics? OK what does that mean? How much to replace the mirrors and how often does that happen? Is the Pro better in this regard?More power? We had the employee post that the W unit can cut  faster. OK that is cool but not a musthave. In other lasers W tubes may last longer than W tubes. Is Glowforge like that? Dunno. How many hours will either tube last? Dunno. We got some unofficial assurances like about a year.The  filter also feels like a poor value. The way it is described I might believe a cost of  and thats being charitable. And so on. Nonetheless I am pretty excited. Give me more information and I may become radiatively coupled to the ground state...,glowforge,cvgfnrp,1,t5_39fje
5237341,0,t1_cvh9qtz,Im in the exact same situation with the addition of the fact that I live near a large University and students would probably pay a few bucks to have their phone or laptop engraved with whatever they want.  This would make it fairly simple to do and perhaps have the thing pay for itself someday.I also have small children who I would like to raise to be makers and the drawandcut feature is something that I think theyll think is pretty awesome.Im also planning to cancel my preorder if I dont see a steady stream of more information from them between now and December fulllength demo videos showing the endtoend process and UI setup process troubleshooting repair etc. people arent getting theirs by the DecemberJanuary timeframe I understand if mine isnt in the first batch since I backed after they had already sold about  preorders but I want to see progress. reviews from people who get theirs before me are bad I dont see more information about how long pieces like the tube mirrors etc. are supposed to last and how much it will cost to replace them since it appears they are custom there doesnt appear to be willingness from Glowforge to open it up further than the well GPL the firmware but if you modify it your warranty is void!Overall Im optimistic on all of these points except maybe the last one since they got  million in funding and claim to already have designed and tested the product and are just waiting to see how many they should have built.  I fully expect some snags with the cloud software at first but they should be able to rapidly fix those.,glowforge,cvhafra,2,t5_39fje

9836623,0,t1_daplcy2,Thanks for the info. Thats more than Ive found out in a week.  Its good to know its not a new startup.  weeks puts us out to late February. Im already waiting  weeks for my Prusa MK D printer I guess more waiting cant hurt...,glowforge,dapqgcm,1,t5_39fje
9870816,0,t3_5gp7sf,Ah I remember Aptera.Fortunately Glowforge is tackling a much simpler problem.  From a hardware standpoint theyre not doing anything terribly groundbreaking or unbelievable.  The software is probably  of the challenge.  As long as they ship the hardware the software can be continuously improved.  And they will be releasing the code for the firmware so if they do go under folks will have them hacked to accept Gcode in no time.,glowforge,dau6v2h,3,t5_39fje
