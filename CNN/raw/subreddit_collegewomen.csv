5375625,0,t1_cvymwwk,We dig trenches nearon the faults and study the past environment. We look at the soilssediments and try to figure out how far the ground on either side of the fault has moved since the last relevant earthquake. Its really fascinating stuff because you can look and see a river or stream on the surface but underneath is totally different and has so much history and information in it. This last time I was working with him we spent  weeks in the middle of the desert digging  meter trenches taking pictures of the trenches then marking the rock units on the pictures making models though I didnt get to do that much and then filling all the holes in again. I also love this field because there is still a lot of unknowns and its a humbling feeling when someone that is widely known like my professor says that he doesnt know why or how the environment looks the way it does. They always encourage younger generations to put in input and dont shame us for speaking our minds. ,collegewomen,cvysp9l,1,t5_3ab8z
