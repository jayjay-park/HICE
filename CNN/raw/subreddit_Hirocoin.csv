617964,0,t1_cgahhab,The bot is already Captcha free. Not sure I totally understand the tip bot redeem feature. I can see that you tried to use it but that there was not enough coins in the pot. I figured that the redeem feature would work on karma earned by the subreddits. When setting it up I removed a zero from the link and comment karma multiplier which I have restored now that I understand it a bit better. The maximum is currently set to HIC. Can you give it another try now?This must be a neat way to redeem coins from various tipbots using your karma D,Hirocoin,cgaihv6,1,t5_30z9y
