1959688,0,t1_ckpab5n,I plan on making a slightly shorter hopefully sort of sequel to this once I get Beyond Earth. Basically Ill replace all the IRLbased sponsors with the major civs from this game. Ive already got names for a few such as the Morrocan Peoples Caliphate and the Catholic Merchant Union Venetian nationalists and of course I shall play as the Holy Celtic Monarchy with one of them. Currently stuck between choosing the PanAsian Cooperative or the Slavic Federation to play the role as the Celtic Empire.Alternate world history will come!,civstories,ckpcewa,3,t5_2w2jx
