193514,0,t1_cf0fhnz,ill say this one again P read them if possible. much much better even though they did quite a good job with SAO in the anime. the anime of accel world which was also fantastic is only the first  volumes of an ongoing LN thats at volume  though so far i think. unfortunately theres only english for the first . and its slowly moving through but still. also SAO goes much much farther after the ALO arc... Damn all these good things to watchread. if only accel worldtechnology existed and i could read and watch things at super fast speeds...,toradora,cf0hcvh,1,t5_2uquc

1802828,0,t1_ck6e92t,Take either Clannad or Kanon . Both are good both are made by KyoAni and Key. If you want to not overdose on feels then The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a good choice.,toradora,ck6eb0g,3,t5_2uquc

7099338,0,t1_d1k4aew,You say the wobble is fairly normal but Ive never seen discs like that. Again the picture I put up might not be clear enough. Regarding returning it...Thats the thing. I asked before buying and the seller doesnt said he usually accept returns after somethings been opened. If I had a higher res camera I could take a better picture. That would bolster my case. But as it is Im not sure I can get a picture that really captures the problem. Im also afraid that even if he accepts it back Ill get charged for shipping.Blarg what to do...,toradora,d1l2xg9,1,t5_2uquc

9075743,0,t1_d82okgn,yea i enjoyed Amis growth the most and waited for more of her  and Ryuji interactions in front of the vending machines those were some of my favorite scenes in the beginning because she did not have much to hide once they knew what her real personality was like and she did not need to put on her persona i unlike others was not expecting them to end up together i was really hoping he would end up with Ami and even after all that happens and her straight up telling him she still helps them out in the end Ami best girl heres my list of recommendations copied and pasted from another threadKokoro ConnectWITH OVAs watch it just do it thank me laterPapa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!

9330844,0,t1_d8ygg7v,No that makes good sense and I do distinctly remember her blushingfidgeting when she was alone with Ryuuji that one morning at the villa.  And though I would agree that Kitamura was probably more of a crush some aspect of those feelings ran much deeper perhaps within a platonic vein as demonstrated by her empassioned attack against Sumire.,toradora,d8yr3t9,2,t5_2uquc
9805247,0,t1_dal760o,Ive watched Anohana after finishing Tora Dora and its really good. Nothing makes me cry the anime that really hit me hard is Plastic Memories lol Im still kinda depressed about it but it didnt made me cry. Thanks for the other suggestions!,toradora,dalphb7,2,t5_2uquc
