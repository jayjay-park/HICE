38014,0,t1_cein82j,I dont get what you mean by infantry play area. The maps you mention are all miles bigger than any of the little Close Qtr maps. If by play area you mean a few buildings then I guess youre right. I am assuming you are likely a conservative in nature and hate to see change?  I find this a poor attempt at trying to offend me. Youre way off base. BF games are as I described at least to veteran players like me. If new players want to treat it as COD Mk II they are welcome to.If I want to play small maps infi only ill play COD. I play BF for the bigger scale battles.Many COD converts enjoyed the CL QTR DLC. No veterans of the series I play with did. Were you not a fan of BC? Rush is only the linear grindfest you think it is on crappy maps like Metro. On most other maps theres wide areas to flank as an attacker. Defenders can legitimately camp the MCOMS or push up and try to force the attackers back. I do both depending on the situation. Getting that last bomb armeddefused with a handful of tickets left is still the most exciting part of BF for me even beating out those sweet  or  wins on Conquest where you pray nobody spawns in.I have more Tank Superiority wins than I do TDM! And x as many Rush wins as I do Conquest but thats because I used to play a lot of  Armoured Kill CQ.  rounds and id be done for the night. I have Rush matches won in  mins pretty often.BF has that much wrong with it im not even going to get started. n.b. Yes Op Firestorm blows on both Rush and Conquest. ,battlefield3,ceirc1x,1,t5_2rlua

But little tweaks makes it oh so much better.For instance Flood Zone usually turns into a rape if one team manages to hold the high roofs have air dominance with helis and hold B flag which denies enemy commander the cruise missile.But make the map infantry only no vehicles at all and suddenly its a fastpaced close quarters combat map where you dont need to worry about snipers from above.IMHO Flood Zone is the absolute worst map with vehicles but one of the best in infantry only.,battlefield3,cerrfh0,7,t5_2rlua

1216717,0,t3_281hfh,The most important thing is to pay attention to sounds and know the areas. Keep an eye on the minimap and flank the heat. Walking instead of sprinting is often enough to keep quiet and sneak up on someone but remember to check your back often. The spotting system makes it very hard to sneak around in the open areas where you can be spotted with the MAV or from a chopper. It works best on indoor settings. Never assume that youre invisible so keep moving at all times. Camping is a sure way to get taken out quickly.All the classes can be played stealthy. As assault you can heal yourself which is handy when you go flanking alone. As support you can bring C and take out tanks. As engineer I use the repair tool to take out tanks or tankmine the roads behind enemy lines. As recon you can setup a spawn point.Keep in mind that the overall purpose of the game is for your team to win the battle by conquering the objectives which you cant do alone because it will blow your stealth the moment you enter the zone. Running around and hiding isnt really helping the team unless you use it to setup a spawn point for your team or waiting for your squad to spawn on you at which point you should be ready to change your playing style into a somewhat more usefull function and go for the objectives.,battlefield3,ci6hz78,3,t5_2rlua

1311674,0,t3_293rxm,There are a few things you can do very easily if you want to have the most responsive game possible.SettingsI would recommend all LOW except Anisotropic filter which should be left at X. This will give you the highest possible FPS in game. You can actually leave most of the settings on High  Ultra and suffer no downsides other than lower FPS however I strongly recommend turning Motion Blur OFF not using any MSAA antialiasing deferred and making sure Ambient Occlusion is OFF. Ambient Occlusion and MSAA cause a very small amount of input lag in Frostbite .It is also a good idea to change Mesh Quality per map. Generally I use Ultra Mesh for any air map and Low Mesh for infantry based maps. Low Mesh improves FPS and frame rate consistency making for smoother gameplay. Anything above Low is pointless if you are not in an air vehicle.Run the game in Full Screen mode not windowed borderless. Make sure Raw Mouse Input is ON. Vsync must be OFF. Huge cause of input lag. This goes for any first person shooter.ConfigThere seems to be some confusion regarding what a config is in here. You can create a user.cfg file to automatically set parameters normally entered in the ingame console every time you launch BF.Follow this guide to make a user.cfg text file. Copy and paste these commands into itWorldRender.SpotLightShadowmapResolution RenderDevice.TrippleBufferingEnable RenderDevice.ForceRenderAheadLimit Gametime.Maxvariablefps  only if you have hz or hz monitor for Hz use  and for Hz use  instead of You need to place the user.cfg in the SAME folder as the bf.exe. This is usually Local disk C  Program Files x  Origin Games  Battlefield Now the commands will be set automatically whenever BF starts.,battlefield3,cih6hl7,5,t5_2rlua

1491242,0,t1_cj34t6z,gt As a pilot please for the love of god dont fly fast and low with the nose never pointing up.Hah! Im totally guilty of this sorry. Like I said I fly the chopper for fun so I do this often though Im trying to stop. I dunno it just feels faster and safer from stingers and lets just face it its a lot of fun. However I only did it when going from point A to B or to get away from stingers. I know its sorta pointless and annoying for gunners and Ive been trying to stop doing it as much and quit driving the helicopter around Ive died a lot from aggressive flying. Dont worry Im cutting down on it! Pgt Use whatever setup you feel the most comfortable with I usually run with guided rockets.It must just be my jetting rubbing off on me but I absolutely hate getting in the air without my radar. The equivalent of having no radar in the air for me is like you playing metro rush with no minimap. It just feels like Ive got one eye stabbed out and cataracts in the other. I honestly didnt even know what guided rockets did because I never swap out my air radar until a couple weeks ago when I watched a video on guided rockets. I thought it just gave the gunner increased range with his guided missiles or something and I almost have  hours in the heli. Anyways if you cant already tell Im an aggressive pilot so I almost never deal with vehicles at long ranges and Id rather just have my radar to watch my back.The main thing I have a problem with is engaging other choppers.You see with jets the better pilot wins the engagement every time. You simply outturn and outmaneuver the other pilot and youve either got enough angles on him to disable him or you just get on his tail and wreck him. Its not like that with choppers. Sometimes absolute noobs can kill the other much more experienced helicopter with a bit of luck and timing. I know Ive killed pilots who had over k heli kills before. The point is its not a rock paper scissor thing in the helicopter like it is in the jet.With helicopters Im always near the ground up in the enemys face. When I notice the other chopper is up theyre usually some noob miles up in the air. If I try to fly up and meet them they just spam me with heat seekers and we all know how fantastically good ECM is at deflecting missiles while youre at high altitudes. Usually I like to use my air radar get right under the chopper below radar and just make a circle around the other chopper. Sorta something like the rolling scissor maneuver in jets but on the vertical axis. They seem to try to pitch their helicopter down at you and shoot but they lose altitude while trying to follow my circle and you can usually get them down to your level. Still yet what then? I usually get absolutely raped by their gunner especially if its the havoc shooting at me and the bullets seem to keep knocking my chopper around. If I try heat seekers I have to angle my chopper up at the other heli while staying below radar and watching my altitude to make sure I dont crash. If I try rocket pods I have to fly up in their face above radar and usually the gunner kills me or my ECM fails to deflect the heat seekers. Dealing with the enemy Havoc is an absolute pain. What do you do if your gunner isnt good with the TV missile or just cant hit the other chopper with his main cannon? Even if the gunner can hit the chopper the Havocs gunner cannon does over twice as much damage in comparison to the Vipers cannon and most of the time if youre flying the Viper and the two choppers are up close and personal the havoc wins a lot more than the other. What can you do?There are plenty of videos on YouTube about defensive maneuvers when it comes to jets. There are spirals yoyos dillons scissors switches ETC. Not to mention there are hundreds of professional dogfighting videos where you can at least observe how good pilots react to different situations. I dont think Ive seen a single video on YouTube of chopper vs chopper dogfights or at least basic tutorials on how to engage and kill enemy helicopters. If there are tell me and Ill study them like I did the dogfighting videos for jets but I just dont see any out there.So anyways how do you go about engaging the other helicopter?,battlefield3,cj37a8o,3,t5_2rlua

1696826,0,t1_cjsvgjn,here is the difference between dogfighting and conquest flying. Dogfighting has become almost a game within a game because there are now servers dedicated for dogfighting. Servers like this usually have friendly fire turned on and both players use the same jet usually the hornet cuz its better. And if you didnt know we use ECM jammer because it hides your plane on Air Radar for a couple seconds giving you time to pull a maneuver. But flares are also kinda useless since most high level players can dodge lockon missles without using counter measures.Please understand that not all conquest pilots are assholes.

1736476,0,t1_cjy0caf,Good aim is most certainly not cheating and more importantly extremely high KD ratio is also not cheating.

Id then go over to check the battle report to see that that very player with an exceptional amp consistent accuracy would actually have an accuracy of around  for that round and for most of his weapons.Heres a prime example of such cheaters. gt And thats what most of the people youre hackusing are doing as well.Please dont make assumptions about what you dont know.

Theres no counter to an airstrike or a huge boost to armor like in Ghosts. It definitely encourages camping and spawn point exploits. Dont believe me? Go find some videos from MLG type players for CoD. Last one I saw was a domination match and the top player took maybe  or  objectives the entire round. The rest of the time he just ran up and down a set of stairs next to a spawn point and shot people a half second after they spawned. These people have no choice on where theyre spawned and this pussy ended the match with something like  kdr. Score streaks are just crappy kills strwak rewards and objectives should be the goal not who can get the most points. ,battlefield3,cp01pd6,8,t5_2rlua

6120730,0,t3_3zdsmj,Theres lots of stuff to learn and many different tactics depending on the game mode and your class.For starters it makes sense to start with assault medic and support ammo guy. Join a squad look at what class they need and spawn on them and give them medkits or ammo. Follow the squad around. Dont rush into the middle of a fight.Pay attention to the minimap. Everytime you shoot youll be visible here so hold your fire unless you need to shoot and move away shortly after. Audio is also important. Running can be heard easily but walking is silent. Use this to your advantage especially when clearing a building.Dont swap weapons everytime you spawn. Instead just start out with the first of the default weapons and get some of the gear for that. Youll need the scopes and other stuff. The kill count is higher in close combat maps so choose those if you need to grind out some gear.When a map loads theres a small text tip. Pay attention and learn all of the tips. Its about the only instructions youll get on the gameplay unless you look it up online yourself.,battlefield3,cyld3m4,2,t5_2rlua
