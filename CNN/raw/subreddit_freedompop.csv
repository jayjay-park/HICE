4817543,0,t1_cu0it2o,Kyocera did a smart move and didnt make too many changes to the core OS a move which I an grateful for. The only problems Im having with it are bluetooth related. My headphones unless they have a direct line of site with the deviceIE Im holding it in my hand or have it in a mount on my bike the playback stutters like crazy. Otherwise I love it,freedompop,cu1sh79,2,t5_2v80w
5270874,0,t1_cvleb4c,I shouldve mentioned that all FreedomPop devices are refurbs so if you can find a deal on them go for it as long as you make sure it fits your needs. I have multiple hotspots and phones. I have rarely paid anything for the services it works out great for me. Others not so much the longest Ive had to wait is  months and the shortest time was a week. ,freedompop,cvlew8q,2,t5_2v80w
5321902,0,t1_cvrvduf,Unfortunately this turned out to be a dud. Currently the only real way to fix the issue is to revert all of the Google apps to the factory versions. Unfortunately the version of hangouts that came with the phone doesnt do calls. Im out of ideas on how to fix this issue. ,freedompop,cvrxocr,1,t5_2v80w

11236879,0,t3_60dzo5,Occams Razor. FP might make mistakes?Ive had  accountsorders with them over  years and Ive never had a single unexpected charge. Actually zero charges at all beyond the orders themselves  I have never paid a dime for FP service.They are definitely set up to capitalize on peoples mistakesinattentiveness but I imagine they are also running on a pretty low operating budget. Having subpar systems and staffing probably explains most mistakeserrors rather than nefarious intent.,freedompop,df5onif,8,t5_2v80w
