314611,0,t3_1xp8u5,TW racial slursFor anyone that might not know the mod there umayonesa started out a few years ago as a racist reddit troll and has over time changed himself into a racist reddit conservative. He mods  subs almost all empty or squatted from rconservative which is like a more racist rLibertarian  to rrace which is a subreddit dedicated to race realism racism denialism and anything related to how multiculturalism is destroying the United States. When hes outside of his own subs hell pop into a thread say some racist shit then bait you to prove that hes racist. If youre not familiar with racist trolls you might get a little heated at his constant denials of his clearly racist rhetoric and then he looks like the reasonable one for being so calm with his racism.His history on reddit and the history of reactionaries on reddit in general is  like a microcosm  of this infamous Lee Atwater quotegtQuestioner But the fact is isnt it that Reagan does get to the Wallace voter and to the racist side of the Wallace voter by doing away with legal services by cutting down on food stamps?gtAtwater You start out in  by saying Nigger nigger nigger. By  you cant say nigger  that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing states rights and all that stuff. Youre getting so abstract now that youre talking about cutting taxes and all these things youre talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. Im not saying that. But Im saying that if it is getting that abstract and that coded that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me  because obviously sitting around saying We want to cut this is much more abstract than even the busing thing and a hell of a lot more abstract than Nigger nigger.He has taken the dogwhistle and really fleshed it out for  use on reddit.,racism,cfddn1w,1,t5_2qhgd

693460,0,t1_cgiiw6l,in this day and age of multimillion dollar think tanks and foundations that do nothing but lobby congress dream up the next days talking points for Fox or find ways to discredit liberalsmost of whom are funded in untraceable ways by cancerous people like the Koch brothers its extremely important to know exactly who is talking and who is paying them to do so.  Im suspicious of cancelcolbert because I dont know if the people who started it are Koch brothers think tank employees or genuinely concerned people. Remember how ACORN got discredited and ultimately defunded? that was the homebuyers assistance program that helped poor people make logical educated choices when buying a homesaved my ass! Some conservative college kids who worked for a conservative think tank dressed up as a pimp and ho and filmed themselves trying to get a mortgage on a pimps salary. the news touted it as a huge scandal as if this happened everywhere  but it was a hatchet job by conservatives to kill off an avenue for poor people to own a home. I digressed in order to illustrate what I feel the same people are trying to do to Colbert  I believe he dances on that line of is he serious? is that his character? so as to maintain his ability to get those cretinous types on his show thereby alerting the masses that yes those people really do still exist. gtIm just saying that I very much doubt that all the time everyone is ONLY laughing at how stupid Colberts character is and not at all at the fact that the accent he is doing is an outrageous exaggerated caricaturethats part of the service that this characterperson Colbert is providing......its absolutely true that some people take him at face value others laugh at how stupid his character is others still laugh unironically at the racial caricatures he portrays. This is how you can find the racist in the room! those that are laughing because hes doing his Asian character and not the irony well....theres your racists. ,racism,cgj3jzq,2,t5_2qhgd

2484406,0,t1_cmiu44i,That makes sense though I guess is it race fetishism to seek out pornographic images only of people with certain features which you find attractive? I dont really understand why its okay to compliment a persons eye or hair colour but not the colour of their skin? Could you elaborate? Of course I would never compliment anyone by putting someone else down but thank you thats good advice. Nobody should be criticized for their idea of beauty and the way they treat their body even if it doesnt fit your own ideals.I would of course never exclude anyone based on race alone but when its purely about sexual attraction pornographic circumstances I almost always stick to the same features as that is what I find most attractive from a purely physical standpoint. I definitely wouldnt choose friends or date people simply because of appearance nor would appearance stop me from dating someone if they were nice its just a preference and not a requirement.,racism,cmium1m,0,t5_2qhgd

There was an AMA from the librarians and other people in Ferguson chimed in saying something about how for the most part the town was pretty much the same except for a few blocks that the media was covering and trying to make it look like that was how the whole town was.  I believe herd mentality can be spread thru all sorts of media as well and thus all the rioting in other areas.

2901839,0,t1_cnxj0mt,You need to think about what race entails in America. To a large extent it depends on what society views you as. But it also has to do with the systemic effects that cannot be seen such as lack of generational wealth the effects of where you live due to racial steering redlining blockbusting culture passed down to you by parentsguardians language food speech and so much more.Jewish people are an ethnoreligious class so its really comparing apples and oranges. Honestly ask yourself where you stand on the axis of race. That white supremacists often engage in antiSemitism does not make Jewish people a race any more than their antihomosexuality makes homosexuals a race.Arab people and Hispanic people in America are conceptualized as a panethnicity which is different from race look up the Census form which separates HispanicNonHispanic from the race question. So yes there can be not just whitepassing but actually white Hispanics. There are many whitepassing Arab people such as some people of Lebanese descent. There can be white Arabs.That some POC are confused with each other and that some religions are conflated with some POC is a function of white supremacy. This should not be confused with the fact that presenting as an adherent to an ethnoreligion or a specific panethnicity as can be seen in porn which is a whole nother topic means you experience being a POC.As for POC vs. nonwhite yes there is a huge difference. The problem with terms like nonwhite and minority is that it puts the focus on white people and the terms consider them normative. By consequence POC are the odd ones. POC is a peoplefirst term much like the term white people is.With that said topics concerning antiSemitism are welcome here as it pertains to white supremacy and postcolonialism Jewish people have a history of being allies to black people and antiracists oppose antiSemitism so consider how a topic pertains to that.,racism,cnxy12y,3,t5_2qhgd

Robert De Niro for example.  And then there are some communities where it is very homogenous you cant imagine interracial datingmarriage etc.  And then people will just flat out say Hey I dont find X race attractive.  I think there are degrees of the level racism.  And then there is the Well I am white and only date black guys etc.  Which is worse? Are they all bad?...  These are my personal opinions and I dont think it is a crime or offensive.  At the very least I dont openly talk about say I find xxx race attractive or unattractive.   That in itself is offensive.   Internally I may find xx person and they may be of a different race and I might find that person attractive is it because of race?  Is there a pattern in who I find attractive?  Maybe.  I wont disqualify people because of race.

8213991,0,t3_4rr3eb,Thank you uyellowmix and uanansi.  Ive been going through this and its been very helpful.  So much to read amp learn.  This is exhausting.  My friend who lives in Dallas just gave birth to a little boy she is white and her husband is black.  Grateful they werent there last night heartbroken that her husband and child could ever be in danger because of the color of their skin.  This is entirely unacceptable and honestly I feel sick.  I know this has been happening for years and that the US has an enormous problem that many will not acknowledge. But we cant wait any longer for a solution  the fact that these killings are now being posted live is horrible but ultimately very helpful  its a noble thing to do that when youre under attack.  This is not the America I believed I lived in. Not at all. Did you guys see this bit of news out of Atlanta yesterday? I hadnt seen that news article before I posted about lynchings and was using lynchings as a more general term of black people being killed for being black but I assume those who killed them tried to couch the murders in he was dangerous it was selfdefense etc.  but yes also overt lynchings like the ones famous during Jim Crow.  Im beginning to see also that the mass incarceration of black men in our country is a direct descendant of Slavery and Jim Crow policies and just as much of a dark mark on our nations conscience as those were and it must be stopped now.  So much can be changed so quickly if we get our fucking politicians to stop playing politics and start leading the country through this. Love and Peace guys. ,racism,d54axk0,1,t5_2qhgd

Again people perpetrating hate and violent crimes can reform I am not denying that. I am saying that the scope of a hatebased mass shooting is beyond the possibilities of what an individual can impact. This has nothing to do with forgiveness or redemption on a personal level.I did some research and its difficult because most shooters either commit suicide are killed in the process were executed sit on death row or are otherwise incarcerated for life. There are a few mass shooters who have died in prison and are lost in time save for Wikipedia I will not link them here.If you go down this list put together by Mother Jones not a single mass shooter who is still alive is doing any work to address it.The best example I could find are Mitchell Johnson and Andrew Golden now Drew Douglas Grant. At the age of  they killed their middle school classmates in Jonesboro Arkansas. They were released at the age of . Johnson is back in prison for assault theft and drugs. Golden disappeared and was found when he applied for a concealed carry permit fingerprints linked his previous identity which was sealed under gag order. He is otherwise living life as if nothing happened.
