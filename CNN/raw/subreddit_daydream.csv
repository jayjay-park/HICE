The Daydream viewer has an NFC spot so that when you insert the phone in the viewer it automatically launches the Daydream app and gets ready for VR.The Daydream viewer can be used like a dumb Cardboard viewer for Cardboard apps but you must first disable NFC on your phone to prevent it from launching the Daydream app when you insert the phone into the viewer.,daydream,dajwwaa,1,t5_2ucfh

10012347,0,t1_dbcl624,It should be fixable in software in your predistortion pass do  different lookups for r g b with a different offset buffer calculated for each wavelength. This is enough because screens only actually emit light on  wavelengths i.e. red green blue so modelling the behaviour of your optics at these  wavelengths suffices.The cost is that you do  times as many texture lookups in your predistortion pass. There is also some loss of fidelity associated with spreading your colour components to noninteger pixel locations. But yes in principle with a. enough computing power and b. higher resolution screens you can compensate perfectly for chromatic aberration.,daydream,dbcmymx,2,t5_2ucfh

10362088,0,t1_dcikz5h,I absolutely disagree with that.When you have to project down a higher level dimension into a lower level dimension your projection gets distorted thus perspective in D to D.In D to D on a D screen you get huge distortion. However if you remove one level of perspective i.e. D to d you can remove some of the distortion.Having a D environment with D objects also allows the natural manipulation of the object and the ability to simulate D space.,daydream,dcilqx3,2,t5_2ucfh

10910148,0,t1_de4lbwo,Yep I agree. I understand when developers were developing for cardboard the look to aim option would have made the most sense but if they are developing for Daydream which comes with a controller we should be using our heads to look around and the controller to aim and shoot.
