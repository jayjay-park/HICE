804531,0,t3_22zwb4,T TourneyHmm.. So I havent really played in over a year so I cant comment about the new clans Frozn and Hurracan but when I played the best clans for tourney weremono SentinelUppersMontanamono UppersBangers also had a nice half deck which was sometimes put together with Uppers half deck.I have played a few tourneys more recently and it was pretty much the same except for Bangers half decks. Sometimes you see Berzerk half decks Spyke mainly and Hurracan decks. The mono Sentinel deck is not what it used to be newer cards are in it.Also I was mainly a DT player so I have seen pretty much all decks yo could see.TI didnt play T as much as I played T but the top tier clans were clasn with great  such us Bangers Junkz and All Stars.About ELO I really dont remember a specific clan being top tier it was more about single cards that were. When those cards were banned their clans were just not played that week.,UrbanRivals,cgvq8u6,1,t5_2s7ch
