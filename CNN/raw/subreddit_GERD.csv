4575012,0,t3_3dohfn,And the best of luck to you! Im currently dealing with what I believe to be silent reflux meaning no heartburn but my throat is constantly an issue. I also have a terrible taste in my mouth. Anyways so far I havent been diagnosed but I see where this is heading. I have heard that antacids can make the situation worse and thus Im going to try some home or overthecounter remedies along with a diet change I already took on to treat my acid reflux. Stay positive there was a time we lived without illness and therell be a time without it again.,GERD,ct7aegq,1,t5_2qlaa
5906227,0,t3_3r9z17,THIS. It is a vicious cycle. When Im extra stressed my GERD flares. When my GERD flares my throat gets tight which makes me panic. Ive had GERD my whole life so usually I can calm myself down but not always. Its also finals week for me so Im just constantly feeling like garbage. PPI in the morning ranitidine at night and a roll of tums I keep in my bag at school. I have to closely watch what I eat and my stomach burns between meals no ulcer just stress acid I guess.Ive definitely had very bad nights with little to no sleep because my stomach hurts and then I have a panic attack and that makes it hurt more.Heres a few tips that work for me. Fucking hoard whatever emergency medicine you have. I swear I have a stash of ranitidine in every bag backpack desk dresser and car I come in contact with. You never know when youll need it.. Water. Have it near you always.. If youre anxious and start feeling sick take your backup medicine as soon as possible and slowly sip the water when you start feeling better. Even if the backup medicine doesnt work quickly it might help calm you down just knowing that youve taken some sort of action.. Find something soothing. There used to be this documentary on netflix about sea turtles I would watch every time I had a panic attack. It was easy to pull up on my computer or phone. Some people like certain songs or have breathing routines or try to count objects in the room. You do whatever feels right and calms you down.. Since you have thrown up and you know its a possibility talk to your doctor. Mine gave me a prescription antinausea pill after I called her hysterical at am once embarrassing in retrospect. Its small and melts on your tongue makes you feel better almost immediately and works for  hours. I only use it as a last resort but it has definitely saved me some some sleep and helped me come down from an anxiety attack faster.. Remember that you know what your body is doing. Its unpleasant when everything comes together and makes you feel horrible but this isnt new and youre prepared. Im sorry youre going through this because I really know how much it sucks. Feel better soon lt,GERD,cxtu8n3,2,t5_2qlaa

7742006,0,t1_d3l8yv7,For me meditation yoga before and after bed and walks during the day with music helped.  I also drink tons of water.  Ive also been very strict with my diet started out with BRAT diet plus chicken breast and some fish usually raw never fried.  Talked with my doctor and switched to elimination diet which is basically riceveggiesmeat.  Seems to be helping out.  Im currently weaning myself off the ppis and other stuff because they cause nauseafoggy head and have potentially serious long term use effects.  Starting to feel sort of hungry now and then first time in months which is great.  I also started listening to some of those wellness podcasts which I always before thought were really cornycrazy.Overall I think managing your head is very important especially with gut stuff.  Theres even serious journal research documenting that.  For me focusing on the stuff that I can change diet meditation exercise lack of stress helped and ignoring things I couldnt doctor stuff stopped googling symptoms every  seconds helped even more.  That being said Im not out of the woods yet I still get nausea sometimes and havent got an endo yet who knows what that finds.  Anyways hope that helps good luck.,GERD,d3m7ker,1,t5_2qlaa
7782547,0,t1_d3qohhy,The rest of the  days were... okay. I had one or two good days but then the diarrhea and nausea got pretty bad for me at least. I found that yogurt really helped calm the nausea. I had a good appetite throughout which helped a lot. The emptier my stomach got the worse the nausea got. All in all Im glad the treatment is over waiting on results to see if the h pylori was eradicated. I did cut out caffeine dairy alcohol and most fatty foods. ,GERD,d3qt76o,2,t5_2qlaa

7838272,0,t3_4monr6,Absolutely. I have identified my main trigger is stress. I can eat and drink badly but if Im at a good point in life my reflux doesnt show. I know if I start getting it regularly its time to start meditating again. Do whatever you can to reduce your stress. Think of your reflux as a blessing though stress is really bad especially long term so thank your body its letting you know   Gaviscon and Ranitidine are OTC medicines you can use to help with the symptoms until you can control your stress levels. Good luck  any questions just shout!!,GERD,d3x38b9,5,t5_2qlaa
8081414,0,t1_d4oeb3o,I actually just went off my Prilosec and have lost about  pounds because I havent been eating as much.  As of right now I am still getting the heartburn.

8229408,0,t3_4g1z9q,I was on Prilosec amp Zantac and everything under the sun off and on for over a decade then it got to a point where it was getting really baduncomfortable so I made an appointment. Doctor ordered a Ultrasound because he thought maybe I had an ulcer and turns out my gallbladder wasnt in the best of shape. I then had to have some kind of test that is done to see how effective your gallbladder is working forget the name of said test and it was at . A month later I got it removed and my symptoms pretty much all went away for almost a year.And.. fast forward to now and theyre back and worse than before the surgery. Before the surgery it was more of a dull ache but now its more of a cramping and occasionally sharp pain.On top of that I stopped Prilosec because of the whole Kidney damage articles and went back to Zantac and it somewhat helps but not enough. I think Ill have to check out DLimonene as one person in this sub suggested.,GERD,d568dnw,1,t5_2qlaa

8638559,0,t1_d6koxz0,Point Usually people manage to lower the amount of PPI and are only required to take it from time to time if required after the first  to  months according to my surgeon. I personally did not reduce the amount yet because I had this huge burping issue which improved dramatically but it is not entirely gone. Also I can not feel heartburn so I am worried that I might not realize when I have another inflammation. However I am scheduled to go back to the hospital for  days for some tests ph measurement etc. and I will have to be totaly off PPI for that. I will see how it goes.Point Symptoms reduced after about  or  months. But the first months I felt very often bloated a common sideeffect as I have been told. Annoying and I had to lay down very often.Point Just one you have to get the battery recharged after  years but since it is directly in the belly fat that should be minor. Point The first studies that I read about Endostim were very promising and also that the probable sideeffects are  according to my information  nothing compared to nissen. It can also be relatively easily removed according to my surgoen again I feel like I write according to too often You are welcome. ,GERD,d6lffks,2,t5_2qlaa

10044058,0,t1_dbgq18p,Im not sure if that would be possible since Versed is also a benzo.

Im sure if I had asked they would have given me a bit of Versed while I waited. I decided to just tough it out. I felt reasonable until I was wheeled into the OR. I think it reminded me of my tonsil surgery when I was a kid which turned into a really horrible experience. Im not all that fond of benzos anyways.,GERD,dbgrlsr,1,t5_2qlaa
