381645,0,t3_1ycf26,I think I would have insisted that we stay onsite the night of our wedding. We rented a really lovely cabin as a honeymoon suite but it was about  minutes up the road and a lot of our guests stayed onsite the night of our wedding we had a campout!. I remember being SO tired and buzzed and just blissfully happy hanging out around the campfire with my best friends and family and it was a huge struggle to get us sent off to our cabin. We didnt get there till around midnight and it would have been a lot more satisfying for us both if we didnt have to worry about driving up a crazy dark road when we really wanted to stay and hang out with our pals. My husband had to wake me up I fell asleep in my chair by the fire!,weddings,cfkbmnq,4,t5_2qji6
