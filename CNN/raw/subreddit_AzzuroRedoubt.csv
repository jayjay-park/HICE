8443932,0,t1_d5x0ynt,Firstly Ive never had any such dream before to be clear.  And I couldnt see the symbol before because looking at your neck is a tough task without a mirror. Zane grins.  Anyway what answers from Eli are you looking for?,AzzuroRedoubt,d5x12z8,3,t5_3c4eg
8458831,0,t1_d5xyqt0,Elis hand flies swiftly to your throat locking it in a vicelike grip. The beast cackles as the world fades away...Blackness.Youre here.The Eli you know stands before you.I have failed you. It was my hatred for the Teal Snapper that weakened the seal and when I lost myself in bloodlust I succumbed to his possession.The young should not sacrifice for their elders. It is the other way round. I have walked the planes for an age. It is your time now. It is not seemly to throw away your freedom on my account! This dream is a failsafe I buried in the deepest reaches of my mind waiting to be triggered in the case that the Trickster attempted to possess another.A string of glowing runes flies toward you from my palm melting together to form a sword floating before you.This is all the help I can give you. When the Crown passes from me you must fight it with all your might.Remember what I have taught you.,AzzuroRedoubt,d5yvzte,3,t5_3c4eg
