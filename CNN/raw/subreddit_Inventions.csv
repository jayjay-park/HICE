Having invented and patented the intermittent windshield wiper mechanism which was useful in light rain or mist he tried to interest the Big Three auto makers in licensing the technology.

5964938,0,t3_3x06z5,This mindset seems kind of sad. How many great ideas do you think mankind has collectively come up with that never went anywhere because wouldbe inventors hoarded their ideas and then never did anything with them? How many innovations have never seen the light of day because of people thinking like this? I for one have lots of random inventions ideas and brainstorms that Im not seriously going to pursue. However Id love to see them live on if someone else is in a better place to make them happen.Besides the best ideas come from collaboration. Probably all of us could have our ideas tweaked improved and totally overhauled with the help of other smart creative people. Thats fun plus it makes you better at designing and brainstorming more ideas. Strength through diversity and iteration.,Inventions,cy1j91x,1,t5_2r2a5
6157478,0,t1_cypie9p,Good question.    If you kept screwing the first stage it would go deep into the cork then when the plastic is flush against the glass of the bottle it would just begin spinning the cork. it would require a lot of strength to do that min you  But with this method.  You first screw the metal screw into the cork pretty far then stop.  Then when you twist the other part it comes down when it reaches the glass mouth of the bottle it can no longer go down so it must force the screw and the cork up.  ,Inventions,cypjhqi,1,t5_2r2a5

I thought it was weird as a kid bc it was virtually only me and my posse of wastrels going outside every day. Rarely saw anyone from school. Im  so this is my obsevation. Kids arent going to sleepoversthey arent out selling lemonade anymore and I see why.Survivalist stuff would be more profitable.

9141384,0,t1_d87m7dl,Yea its kind of sad. My childhood kicked ass I was never home. I dont know maybe kids have it better today I dont know but if I had my choice I would choose my way of child hood every time. Climbing trees having adventures falling off bikes getting yelled at by my parents for coming home way too late because I was out adventuring. I once built a small roller coaster by myself in my back yard out of an old toy car and PVC piping. Damn I want to be a kid again. ,Inventions,d8aqifm,1,t5_2r2a5

If you can design a sensor that will do what you want it could  just connect  by replacing the button at the contacts. That simplifies the problem considerably.,Inventions,dfaj58l,1,t5_2r2a5
11595459,0,t1_dga0xqx,Hi CluelessCarter thanks for the reply.As far as I know it has all the relevant certifications as the specifics were designed by another company at a cost of around  if I remember correctly. The idea is to find a company to license it the development is already done we just need a company to mass produce it now.I thought about trade shows but were using that as a last effort as I think its unlikely anything will come from it.Theres an American company called Lambert amp Lambert they specifically deal with products at this stage they help get them licensed for a small fee do you know of any British version by any chance? Thanks again.,Inventions,dgacqrp,1,t5_2r2a5
