8582799,0,t1_d6ckzq1,I dont think it will unfold that way. Now UK has  options only  trigger A or announce that the referendum will be ignored. Any of those will have to happen before there is any negotiation done with EU.,brealism,d6efoxb,1,t5_3f9cs
8743785,0,t1_d6ymhr7,That would be the way to spin it. Also respecting the large minority. But what she cant fudge are the net migration figures for the following year or two.Perhaps that is another reason why shes delaying. She needs to be reelected before the public realise that it is roughly the same as before and that very little has changed.You can bet that UKIP will be campaigning heavily on it.,brealism,d6ymjws,3,t5_3f9cs
8837339,0,t3_518tet,ubritredditor and I were discussing elsewhere the stories today about May writing off a pointsbased system. Frustratingly though many article claimed this none of them provided quotes which backed up the claim. They all just quoted extracts from thisgt One of the issues is whether or not pointsbased systems do work. A lot of people talk about a pointsbased system as always being the answer in immigration. There is no single silver bullet that is the answer.Which doesnt actually say anything firm either way.Then BritRedditor found the above article which makes it abundantly cleargt Her spokesman went further saying The precise way in which the government will control the movement of EU nationals to Britain after Brexit is yet to be determined. However as the PM has said many times in the past a pointsbased system will not work and is not an option.Thanks mate ,brealism,d7a4gby,1,t5_3f9cs
9075432,0,t1_d7y4s01,Its stupid to expect an immediate change it takes time to put plans into action.  For example companies cant just move abroad in a week it takes months of planning.  Likewise salaries wont be cut immediately and prices wont rise in one day.  But over months these effects will be felt.,brealism,d82px53,1,t5_3f9cs
9493803,0,t3_5aqq2q,To put this article into perspective Neither tagesschau.de nor spiegel.de the two most important news outlets even mentioned it and focused more on the newly introduced minimum wage and the headline which appeals for more reforms. There was a minority vote by the way which calls for deeper integration and not for a strengthening of subsidiarity.,brealism,d9jbbvq,3,t5_3f9cs
9674040,0,t1_da5izdf,The government have pledged to reduce all migration. Actually they did this a few years ago down to tens of thousands. Obviously they missed that insane target but they have said theyll keep trying. They also just raised the minimum income to . NonEU migrants arent affected by Brexit but by other policies of the govt.,brealism,da5j1av,4,t5_3f9cs
10596243,0,t3_5ros5b,These analyses feel a bit idle though. The government just doesnt care anymore. This White Paper from today looks like it was drafted in Venezuela and not in the UK. The administration is collapsing.,brealism,dd8x5vb,1,t5_3f9cs
10895162,0,t1_de3bc9n,Seriously I am torn.At one level I think his buffoonery and lack of dignity is disgusting.At another I think he does show the world something fundamental about our ingrained amateurism. I dont know that this is worse for nonEuropeans than Europeans.I should say I am myself ethnically Chinese.,brealism,de3rbjz,1,t5_3f9cs

11583572,0,t1_dg8zk4a,I spent a fair amount of time in eastern Europe in the s but didnt see much of East Germany. I only added it in for the cultural reference. So unlike Paul Nuttall I wasnt in Berlin when the wall came down but I was in Warsaw when Wojciech Jaruzelski resigned. The TV interviews of the senior party members were interesting. They kept looking around as if to say Is he allowed to ask me that? Whats the official line on that? What were you doing in the DDR?,brealism,dg906mo,1,t5_3f9cs
11644920,0,t1_dgf3it7,They will do whatever gets them the most votes and into power to enrich themselves and those around them.You see the UK Conservative party dont actually have any core values. They will do whatever it takes to get the vote.Look at the past.Theyve privatised.Theyve nationalised.Theyve changed where taxes are charged.Theyve changed who pays taxes.Theyve increased welfare and decreased it.Theyve gone to war.Theyve declined from going to war.You can predict where they are aiming by what gets them and keeps them in power. So they are probably looking at the leave demographic and the caveats that certain sections in this demographic had. The ultra die hard leave at any cost ones cant be pleased either way. So theyll go after the Ill all for it as long as it doesnt affect my living standards types.,brealism,dgfyrke,2,t5_3f9cs
11718942,0,t3_677zsn,The increase in French imports is of the same order of magnitude as the additional imports the UK should have gotten. Seems reasonable to assume that Irish firms are starting to use monies earned from exports to UK to buy stuff from France.,brealism,dgodcx5,5,t5_3f9cs
