6700509,0,t3_47err5,Heres a photo album with explanations of my recent trip to The American School of French Marquetry I worked on two exciting marquetry panels a piece by piece music motif and a fleur clat. This is the first clat done in North America in over  years and one of only three that I know to exist here the other two were done by my teachers Patrice Lejeune and William Patrick Edwards It is a very complex technique that requires total control throughout the design planning the clat the placement of the design on the packet and the cutting.Here is a link to a video I took of the chevalet de marqueterie in action. Here Im cutting out a piece by piece leaf. Hope you enjoy the post and let me know if you have any questions!Luke,finecraftsmanship,d0ce2pd,3,t5_3crnj
