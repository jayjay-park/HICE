1259740,0,t1_cib2zoh,Blah blah blah. Misogyny means anything that demeans the female gender. Your word definitions are full of things that demean women. Im sorry. Thats what TRP does and thats what TRP is about. Male superiority female inferiority. Based on biotruths that are based on pseudoscience. Its pretty plain to see from the outside but I know it can get obfuscated when youre on the inside. Your cute frothing at the mouth wont change that. All Ive ever been when Ive dealt with you is amused at most slightly frustrated. Thats the difference between us bub. Youre angry Im not. Amused mastery? YES!As for your complaints about the article you know perfectly well I didnt speak of one cancer patient but rather an increasingly large group of women whore not allowed their reproductive rights for the sake of... I dont know. For the woman giving birth naturally would be better you know rather than a forced Csection. But keep trying little one.I would like to see men value themselves more but TRP isnt the way to doing that. It espouses the most toxic most mainstream form of masculinity that youll ever find. Mentally baggaging yourself with stuff like TRP isnt a good thing. Im sorry. Men have been fighting TRPs kind of masculinity for years. It doesnt let a man be himself it puts him in a restrictive box where he can only be a perverted caricature of himself. Thats not healthy.... Invoking Godwins law. Classy. Also you should totally stop lying to yourself. If you werent feeling threatened you wouldnt use such a threatening tone to try and silence me. Which is cute you know. Its not gonna work though.,Friendzone,cibc43j,4,t5_2suqk

5019408,0,t3_3bcn0b,Hes not friendzoned by her because she hates him and isnt shy to say it. Theres an episode where you find out that she allows him to stalk her in order to keep her out of trouble funnily enough he caused all the trouble to her to make her think she needs to be stalked aka protected. But I digress. ,Friendzone,cur12y8,1,t5_2suqk

5625136,0,t1_cwu8tri,Sounds like shes mentally impish and capricious with your feelings.  Not worth investing your emotions in someone who doesnt care what effect they have them.  That would be my advice if she hadnt already made it clear she just wants to be friends.  So you have your answer.,Friendzone,cwuco1r,2,t5_2suqk

8224574,0,t3_4pviu5,Women are intuitive. She knows already. Like another poster suggested just let her know with confidence. Put it out there. Youve been making it obvious for a while now and she probably got the impression that youre too afraid to do anything. Youre your own worst enemy. Youve made an impression on her that youre not confident not sure about what you want and you may never even give it a shot. If you cant tell if she is interested in you also she probably isnt. So right now you have nothing to lose. You will only gain experience and learn that in life you dont always get the girl. But it WILL make you do one thing  grow. You shouldnt look at this as being afraid of losing her look at it as a chance to make yourself proud by trying to go for it.  Put trust in yourself!  Youll get over this with time but you will never forgive yourself if you dont go for it.  ,Friendzone,d55mma1,2,t5_2suqk

9939269,0,t3_5cmnf0,You are a sidechick my friend. Tell him what tf is up or drop it. Tell him that you think his gf isnt good for him and that you have more to provide for him sex chill personality etc. But at the same time tell him that you dont want to be sexually active with hik while he is in a relationship. Yes he is the one cheating but you still know he has a gf so that you are still playing a part in cheating. This comment is a little late but how has it gone? ,Friendzone,db341f7,1,t5_2suqk

10903501,0,t3_5eb9bu,I suppose that depends on how strong your feelings are for her. You can go from I like you to Im in love with you and have no clue how you got there. If she were interested in a relationship with you she would go for it. I know thats not what you want to hear. Im in a similar situation myself. PUSH HER.  Dont let her keep you in orbit just to validate herself and boost her self esteem so she can find someone better. Seeing her with someone else will kill you. Dont let it go that far. Do something. ,Friendzone,de4ma2n,1,t5_2suqk
