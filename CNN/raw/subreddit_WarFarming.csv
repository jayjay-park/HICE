3948432,0,t3_35m5dg,This would be the old when two war farming clans meet the preference now is to get clanxp so maybe  draw to do this one needs tight control of ones clan members the first time you do this you learn which of your members are no good and boot them send a message for ALL members to  star or better their opposite  and number  and to complete all their attacks by  hour before war end.  the leader and  trusted cos or three cos hold back their attacks.  at half an hour to go all people except those three who haver not attacked yet get bootedwith invite to return after war in this final  mins the co leaders use their attacke to draw the score.  durinbg the war both clans must not let the star difference be greater than  stars at any time.  It may sound difficult I have done it and seen three other matches do it and one of them even said it was a good thing as you get to see which of your clan mates are selfish.,WarFarming,cr6cszp,2,t5_3843t
