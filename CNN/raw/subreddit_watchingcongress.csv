2403974,0,t1_cm87ds7,Yes that would indeed be the idea behind being consistent about it all. Im not entirely sure that itll work out for the best but it goes to reason what makes this idea succeed or fail at the NY fed should be reproducible. UNLESS...doing that undermines central bank independence Im not sure if that would be the case though. ,watchingcongress,cm8u8wx,1,t5_2u065

7778341,0,t3_4lux5g,I wonder how much would be needed if the military itself was asking for the budget not the congressman who need bases kept open for local support ect? I also wonder where they would recommend spending that would be at odds with both congress and vendors ?,watchingcongress,d3qc0b0,1,t5_2u065

11202602,0,t3_5zs9z5,I havent read the bill because I wouldnt know where to find it and if I found it what Im looking for would be buried and I havent had enough sleep or coffee...But Id be willing to bet the help individuals ... obtain rehabilitative services is more along the lines of require.  And if you dont try rehabilitation your benefits are denied  even if rehab wouldnt benefit you.  Or its some way of getting people thrown off disability.Or maybe Congressman Hill is one of the extremely rare Republicans who knows a person who needs help and this is why it was introduced.,watchingcongress,df1stuy,1,t5_2u065
11684334,0,t3_66ptt4,I have no idea how this would be enforced but this sounds like a really good step in the right direction.  ISO IEEE IETF and RFC codes National Academy of Science these are just a few organizations who maintain standardization and best practices in the ITIS tech fields.  The best cybersecurity is understanding how technology networking communications and software works on a fundamental level.,watchingcongress,dgkfq3r,1,t5_2u065
