2084522,0,t1_cl4old0,First off thanks a lot for the in depth response definitely helped me a lot. Ill definitely be very careful with what Im signing. Ill make sure I can get in the SF line as well. I agree with the fact even if I cant finish BRC Ill still work alongside marines which is fine by me. If you dont mind me asking what was it that made you drop from BRC? And what was the training schedule like in terms of weeks?  days on  days off? Again I really do appreciate the time youve taken to respond to my post. I could use as much information as possible haha ,CorpsmanUp,cl4se8x,2,t5_2ztc7
2085087,0,t1_cl4szyi,Damn well that answers my questions. Thanks for the honest response Fehnor. At least you can say that you had the tenacity to attempt BRC  times I really do respect that a lot. Do you have any words of wisdom or advice for me? I can use any edge I can get while I prepare myself for the hell of BRC haha.,CorpsmanUp,cl4uzap,2,t5_2ztc7

9869396,0,t3_5fn8dh,Well its actually possible although probably wont happen. If you go to fmf school and move to Florida and join th anglico and get them to like you think you have potential they MIGHT allocate their funding to send you to jump school. Again possible but wont happen. ,CorpsmanUp,dau071w,1,t5_2ztc7

10463918,0,t3_5own9n,Ive been in Quantico for the past  years its a pretty good place if youre into huntingfishinghiking. Base housing is actually really nice if you have a family and depending on which clinic youre assigned to the commute keeps you off of I. Otherwise a lot of people live further south in Stafford or Fredericksburg. My family and I took advantage of being so close to DC and have made the trip down to VA Beach a couple times as well. As most people will tell you each command is what you make of it. PM me if you want more specific info. ,CorpsmanUp,dcu6wlj,1,t5_2ztc7
