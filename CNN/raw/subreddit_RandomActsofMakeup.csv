4199,0,t3_1u5q6v,This is exactly what I need. Just a simple little desk. I dont have a whole lot of extra space. Where did you get this?,RandomActsofMakeup,ceewyvk,2,t5_2vigj
4628,0,t3_1u6hh6,Lets talk about monolidshooded lidsAsian eyes for a second theres nothing more frustrating than hunting down the perfect makeup tutorial slaving through each step and reaching the final look and realizing that its just not going to work out the way you want it to.  Sure youve done everything exactly the way that the friendly blogger has but theres one simple difference between them and youHeShe has two parts to their eyelid youve only got one.Why does this make a difference?  A wellexecuted eyeshadow look is heavily reliant on the existing structure of the eye where theres a crease theres a place to put a crease color where theres an existing slope to the outer v theres a place to lay down the outer v color. Those with a double movable lid are already halfway there since the natural shape of their eye gives them a little help and does some of the work for them but  Monolids tend to lack these structures to their lids so lets think of coloring up double lids as painting a sculpture whereas coloring up a single lid or a hooded one is more like painting a canvas.  Now the sculpture already has depth but you want to create the illusion of depth on the canvas  how can we accomplish this?By fiddling with dimension of course!Now the term dimension may seem a bit ambiguous so lets explore that for a second.  When discussing dimension as it relates to makeup we know that dark colors make features appear more sunken and light colors tend to make things appear as though they are popping out However there are some other facets of dimension that should be considered especially if you require additional shaping.  First and foremost gradient or the movement of color from dark to light or vice versa plays an important role in shaping the eye.  How quickly does the dark fade into light?  The speed at which the gradient changes shows how abruptly or smoothly the slope of the eye structure is changing.  If you will take a look at the picture Ive provided  The gradient changes abruptly where the movable lid meets the crease.  This is because on a natural double lid the movable lid tends to dive down rather quickly into the crease when the eyes are open.  The gradient between the crease and the brow highlight is much slower since the slope between those two areas again on a double lid is much less steep.  Setting up this basic shape is imperative to building the double lid look That is of course if thats what youre going for!The other facet of dimension that I keep in mind as a general rule of thumb is texture.  How is light going to react to this eyeshadow?   Eyeshadows that shimmer glimmer sparkle glitter etc. will reflect light more obviously whereas your shadows that tend to take a backseat in the shimmer arena tend to reflect light more subtly.  Keeping this in mind lets think back to the first basic rule of dimension colors that appear darker will seem more set in and colors that appear lighter will seem more popped out.  Remembering the second basic rule of dimension use these textures to your advantage.  Need to make an area of your lid appear more prominent?  No problem!  Pop some shimmer on it!  If you refer to the photo on this post youll see Ive used shades that shimmer on the highlight of the brow the center of the lid and on the tear duct.  Glitter if used sparsely can help generate this effect as well!Now heres the good news for all you hoodedasianmonolidded ladies and gents out there double lids are much harder to change the shape of considering that the natural structure of the eye tends to get in the way of creating a different crease shape to change the shape of the eye.  Need more lid space?  Draw a higher crease while you laugh tantalizingly at your less fortunate doublelidded counterparts.  Want to emulate your favorite celebritys eye shape?  Use the three facets of dimension to make a perfect copy of their eye on that beautiful blank canvas youve got on your eyeballs!  Your less fortunate doublelidded counterparts will be struggling through cancelling out their own pesky natural crease long after youve slicked on your last stroke of mascara.At the end of the day its going to take practice to get everything just right.  In the meantime embrace the way you are love yourself and regardless of whether youve got one two or eleven take care of those eyelids!,RandomActsofMakeup,ceeypwf,7,t5_2vigj

20155,0,t3_1uc8kv,I love my Wondervision palette! I think they just arent padded while in transit though. When I got mine in the mail the lid didnt sit flat so it wouldnt clasp closed and a couple of the shadows were crumbly. So I took it back to Ulta and exchanged it and checked out in the car and that one was worse than the first one! It was bored in the middle and both edges were lifted from the lid. I ended up opening the  boxes they had to find one that closed nearly all the way. It seems like they werent packaged with any padding and stuff just got stacked on top of them without a thought. ,RandomActsofMakeup,cegq7gr,1,t5_2vigj

32511,0,t3_1ugyys,Ill give you two different stories from the same experience.  One good one not so good.  A couple of years ago my mother was in a traumatic accident.  My entire family rushed to the hospital where we proceeded to wait for  hours or so but it felt longer.  So much longer.  No one came to speak with us no one updated us. Nothing.  For  hours.  The only reason we were at the hospital at all was because the police escorted my father and brother there.  They didnt have any information save the fact that she was in an automobile accident.When it was time for an update only immediate family members were let into the ICU for obvious reasons  I have a gigantic family and we overtook two halls and a waiting room. The doctor had such a flat affect like he really didnt care if he delivered the news that my mom had  hours to pull through or not.  He blandly stared at my father brother and myself as he rattled off her various and suspected injuries.  We had a million questions which he couldnt answer because there was too much blood or something.  All the terminology was highly technical so we really didnt know what he was talking about.  But we got the big picture  life or death for the next  hours and he did NOT want to get our hopes up.  Theyd been working on her for  or  hours and could not get her stable.  He shrugged a few times and mentioned something about time constraints and he had to go.  We stood in the hallway dazed and watched him fade into the ICU.That was the not so good experience. A few weeks later when my mom had finally been moved out of the ICU and onto a regular floor dont know what those are called we became familiar with several different nurses.  Two of which were so amazing.  Every time they came into the room they gave us very detailed updates on what had been done when the doctors had come in how my mom was progressing everything.  They answered our questions patiently and they always seemed to care.  Whether or not they were truly empathetic they sure seemed that way.  They complimented our family once for how diligently we came in and stood guard for Mom.  We saw how many other people they had on the floor and how busy and overworked they were but they still had a few moments to say something positive and joke with us about mundane things.  I feel like the nurses were the stars of that show at least from my perspective.  Maybe a year or so later once my mom was mentally emotionally and kinda physically ready we visited the hospital with a gift basket for that floor.  We all thanked that floor for their hard work and dedication.  That was the good experience good doctor.Thanks so much for hosting and congratulations on making it through med school!  My SO is in his second year so I see how tough it is. ,RandomActsofMakeup,cei4smw,2,t5_2vigj

41141,0,t3_1ukkm7,Dont spend a fortune if you try a brow gel. Start with a clear one and keep in mind that you can use a clear mascara on your brows as well. Saying that buy an inexpensive drugstore brand one first to try it out. Most brands should carry one.  And as already mentioned trimming helps a lot. You can use normal scissors to do this easily enough. Just brush your hair down and trim the hangings then brush up and trim the hangings. Regular or nose hair scissors work very well.Loreal Dream Lumi foundation is a fairly thin but medium coverage foundation and I find that it never clumps for me. It sort of soaks in like a BB cream but has great coverage. Really awesome formula.,RandomActsofMakeup,cej456t,1,t5_2vigj

They also have one with a more subtle bronzing effect but way more subtle than actual bronzer if youd prefer that undertone. Go swatch them in Sephora and you should be able to find your perfect one.

79552,0,t3_1v0gtb,I know you said you need to get your brows done but are you still currently filling them in? It looks like you may need to go lighter with the color separate from any shaping issues. Do you have a blending brush? That is the biggest thing about the eyeshadow that I notice. The easiest way to start practicing with blending that Ive found is to pick colors in the same color family. That way youll be able to see the gradient effect taking place that is much harder to achieve when theres a big difference in hue. ,RandomActsofMakeup,cenhhsw,1,t5_2vigj

119994,0,t3_1vgai8,Ive been going through a tough time as well. Ive been ill since November  and went from being an ambitious college student to almost completely housebound in the span of a few weeks. After undergoing extensive testing for almost a year I was given a diagnosis of CFS which is really more a collection of symptoms than a true disease since so little is understood about it. My doctors arent satisfied with CFS as an explanation for everything so Im still getting tests done frequently in the hopes of finding something more treatable.I spent a good year moping about how my life had changed and how unlucky I was woe is me etc. Ive recently had to accept that this is my life now and it may be this way for a good long while so I decided to make the best of it. I just joined this community recently but Ive been playing around with makeup and skincare for a couple of months and its really helped put me in a more positive mindset. I had to embrace the idea of doing my makeup just for myself since I dont get out most days. It was kind of freeing. Now if I want to wear fuchsia and turquoise eyeshadow around my apartment I damn well will. The point Im trying to make is that ultrashitty things happen to people all the time and its not logical or fair. Its perfectly rational to sit around and be sad about it but its not particularly productive. Use that energy to do something positive for yourself and try to remember that the SUNSHINE will come out again soon. ,RandomActsofMakeup,ces3f7d,1,t5_2vigj

141095,0,t3_1voqjq,I shop at both. It just depends on the brand that Im looking for also coupons. Ulta usually has pretty good sales and great coupons. I also like that they have drugstore products. Ultas rewards program is in my opinion better than Sephoras. At Ulta with the rewards program Im in you earn points to get money back. Right now I believe I have enough points saved up to get  back. I can use that money on any purchase. Sephoras  point point perks dont feel worth it to me. Id much rather have money back to pick a fullsized product that I want. I tend to like the employees better at Sephora but thats just the stores that Ive visted. I like the atmosphere at Sephora better Ulta can seem a bit cluttered to me. ,RandomActsofMakeup,ceui1c6,2,t5_2vigj

The sephoras in my area are both in the mall and are always so busy that the SAs never get to really spend any time with a customer. Every time I go into the Sephora I leave disappointed and feeling rushed. I went to Ulta recently and because of this and even though I had to wait a few minutes for someone to help me out she made sure she spent close to  minutes with just me showing me some stuff and matching me.

159887,0,t3_1vwvw6,Ok Im gonna give it to ya straight the Clarisonic works great for a lot of people....I just dont think Im one of them When I first got it I loved it. Used it once daily and I thought it made my skin so clean and fresh feeling. As the weeks went by though I started to notice that every time I used it my skin would have red and patchy spots and even start to flake off and be uneven. Its awful  To be fair I have mild rosacea but I was told the Clarisonic should help with that. Now that Ive done more research online its clear I need to use a non abrasive method of exfoliating...I even did a little experiment and on the days where I didnt use the Clarisonic my skin was much smoother and not as red. So pretty much I wont be using my Clarisonic anymore Im gonna return it and probably get some Philosophy skincare stuff. It makes me sad because I was so excited about it but that damn thing is tearing my face up literally and I just cant have that!For what its worth my skin is fairly sensitive and dry at times it can be oily in my Tzone. I dont have any issues with acne. I moisturize daily and try to take great care when it comes to my skin. Overall if you dont have rosacea or super sensitive skin I think you should go for it! Honestly though I would buy it from either Sephora or Nordstroms and make sure to keep the receipt and every single part that comes with it in case you want to return it. Source I work at Sephora and we will let you return it even if its opened and used,RandomActsofMakeup,cewn7e3,2,t5_2vigj

Black Magic is an awesome soap I was suffering from dull uneven skin and Black Magic began correcting that after only two or three uses  and despite being a soap bar its not drying for me at all some people do report needing to moisturize after using it in the winter I personally moisturize year round regardless. The Benton line is very moisturizing and gentle and seems to be gradually lightening my PIH acne scars. Honey also brightens my skin and may help with acne  it also rinses off very easily despite going on sticky and my skin feels sooo smooth after. I like to tap the honey on my face a bit when I put it on  seems to have a mild exfoliating effect when I do that.,RandomActsofMakeup,ceykq3x,1,t5_2vigj

259542,0,t1_cf7nmde,The brush is so great at multitasking I use it for brush and highlighter and in a pinch Ive used it for contouring. Its fantastic for gently applying really pigmented blush or a heavier application. And its just so pretty.   When you look at what you want a drug to do like bind to block a specific enzyme then look at the chemical structure of the enzyme and design a drug that will bind to it. The opposite is screening which is what normally happens where they just take tons of compounds and screen them for activity against anything and everything and hope that their lucky. ,RandomActsofMakeup,cf7nsbs,2,t5_2vigj

My bf and I decided to exchange gifts with a price limit of  and we each picked out gifts that we wanted which was great. Then he wanted me to take him out to dinner last night ok. I did even though I was a miserable sniffly sneezy mess and paid for our meals. Then today I feel even worse and he wants me to do all this shit or he wants to do stuff that is inconveniencing me but IM SICK MAN CAN I GET A BREAK PLEASE? Ughhhhh!! He was yelling for me from the kitchen and I texted him because my voice is hoarse and I didnt want to get out of bed just to see what he wanted. Is that unreasonable?! I texted him and then when he finally came in here I tried to explain how he can text me or call if he needs me but his rebuttal is that were in the same house!! So? I feel like he calls for me to come look at the cat doing something and expects me to drop whatever Im doing but then when I call for him it always takes him ten fucking minutes to finally see what I want. Geeeeez. He asks if Im going to be in bed for awhile even though he was BEGGING me to get into bed yesterday and rest because he wants to wash the sheets. Apparently I dont drink my liquids fast enough for him which fucking irritates me. Can I eat and drink at my own goddamn pace please?!!?!?!?!?!!? I AM SO NOT IN THE MOOD FOR THIS OH MY GOD LEAVE ME BE! Then he wants me to do my homework RIGHT NOW because he wants to help me and hes going home to visit his parents later but then wont even tell me when hes going to get his tux fitted for his cousins wedding. Apparently if Im in bed I need to be SLEEPING ONLY because itll piss him off if Im watching Netflix. Fuuuuuuucccckkkkk. I know most of this probably doesnt even make sense sorrry. T.T OH YEAH THEN!!! He asks me to change the tp roll when its used up WHICH I NORMALLY DO but for the record I always do it for my bathroom and he never does it for mine when he ends the roll. Then the one I used in his bathroom HAD ONE FUCKING SQUARE LEFT and he bitches that I dont put trashbags in the trashcans.

382463,0,t1_cfkdqsm,Aw thank you! Im just super excited that youre going to tough it out and go to the dermatologist. At my first visit I swear everyone in the waiting room had perfect skin and I was like jerks what do they even need to be here for... oh right.Okay questions The first month of treatment was definitely the worst. I wont sugarcoat it there certainly is a learning curve with retioids. But like I said before I still noticed crazy improvement. I suggest taking before pictures so that you can flip through them in a few months and be so happy. The downside my face was constantly red and the area around my eyes and mouth were even redder and peeled nonstop. I woke up one morning and it looked like I had rubbed sand paper on my cheek ew. But by the middle of the second month the peeling mostly stopped and now I can just exfoliate with my fingers when I wash my face at night.How did I cope? Most important thing is to start slow. My doctor had me start with the short contact method. Basically you apply the retinoid as directed then wash it off after  minutes. The goal is to slowly build up that time frame over a matter of weeks until you can tolerate it over night. I would skip my cheeks every other night and sometimes skip a whole night if my skin was too irritated. Oh! and find a good moisturizer maybe two. ,RandomActsofMakeup,cfkeoh7,2,t5_2vigj

When I swatched them they swatched pretty patchily and appeared very powdery.On the plus side they are very pigmented and seem to blend out easily. Im hoping that the patchy application will not translate to the face! Ill come back and update this once Ive tried them on my face.Of the lot Coral Cove and Love Potion are gorgeous colors and my favorite! Edit  After applying these to my face I can say that the powderyness and patchyness are not a problem! They applied easily blended out smoothly and in general were lovely to use.

The best trick Ive found is making sure I do my eyeshadow first and then when Im applying foundation I use a small eyeshadow brush and the foundation to tone down any of the shadow thats ended up a bit too high.  It also helps to blend with a dry brush that doesnt have any product on itthat way you dont end up inadvertently dumping more product in a spot that youre trying to tone down. Also I mentioned Glitter Glue somewhere farther down in this postits amazing! ,RandomActsofMakeup,cfr3wao,1,t5_2vigj

She wanted to be back in her room at the nursing home that was the only thing she wanted. Took four days to get her back there and two hours after she was home she was gone. Its been surreal. Shes the very first person Ive lost. So dealing with this has been very new.

498559,0,t3_1ztyxu,Hi there!Ipsy and Birchbox dont do onetime subscribes they only do monthly. However you could subscribe and then cancel when you get your first bagbox. Not the best option especially because Ipsy has a waitlist but if youre really interested in them specifically you could. I like Ipsy more because I get more makeup from them. Birchbox only gives me skincare and hair products but I still find it worth the  most months. Right now theyre doing an incentive promotion when you join where you can get a mini benefit product I think Wantable does onetime boxes but theyre more expensive than Ipsy and Birchbox. I dont know from personal experience about any others but you should head over to rBeautyBoxes and look around for more details about other boxes. ,RandomActsofMakeup,cfwxu49,1,t5_2vigj

Complimenting someone is completely different than giving advice. In your original post you ask how can you tell someone to fix something without sounding rude in the example you just gave you just gave a compliment not feedback. So thats not really the same thing. You arent telling anyone to fix anything.If you are going to just give a compliment and recommend something that should be fine.

He was just a scrawny annoying boy who was the brother of my friends. I left the church a couple years later and kept in touch with his oldest sister but never had more than a passing thought about him. I started dating my ex and naturally we hung out. Very quickly we developed a friendship and he has been the one I turn to when I need advice a shoulder or an ear. Whats awesome is I know it will always be platonic. Neither of us would hurt my ex like that. There was even an awesome drunken moment at a bar shortly after the break up. I was dancing with a random we all went out to smoke and cool off. I gave my buddy the little head nod to get lost and started talking to random dude who proceeded to kiss me. He went to get another round and I ran up to my friend saying OMG he kissed me. He misunderstood thinking I was asking him to kiss me to get dude to go away and gave me the sweetest kiss right under my eye. Its now something we laugh about.

630786,0,t3_21cxlk,Hi there  I think youre doing better than bare basics! Your face makeup looks great and the lipstick really suits you. If this is your everyday makeup my advice would be to try out using a light or lightER eyeshadow on your lid and keep the darker shades to your crease andor lashline. It really brightens up the eyes instead of weighing them down with dark colors on the whole lid. And dont forget mascara! It really pulls the whole look together.

725668,0,t3_21ro9u,ConfidentConfidence for me has come recently when I finally quit biting my nails. I was always so embarrassed about it but couldnt stop because it was my anxiety release. Its funny too that this confidence came with a quick blow to the face. Literally. I fell on the sidewalk and smashed my face breaking my front tooth. I couldnt bit my nails due to the pain and once I finally got a cap on my tooth which coincidentally was my crooked one and now my smile is straight I was able to stop. I hate the way it feels on my fake tooth and cant do it! Its wonderful to be able to show off my long nails and paint them fun colors. It is really what started my whole I need to take care of myself thing which included starting makeup. Breaking my tooth was humiliating but without that I would not be as confident as I am now.

732701,0,t3_22ith9,Which MUFE were you looking to get? I ask because the MUFE HD is the only foundation Ive ever tried where I actually  NEEDED a primer otherwise within  hours it would pool into lines I didnt even know I had. Good times. For the record I actually really didnt like the MUFE primer I had with the HD foundation at all although it worked great with the Mat Velvet. Weird.  I suspect youre going to get a lot of it depends answers because er well it does. Do certain ingredients break you out? Does foundation tend to slide off your face? Are you flaky? Does your skin hate everything? If you havent really seen a difference maybe you dont need it. I know that for me I see absolutely NO difference whatsoever between wearing primer under my foundation and not the one exception was the MUFE HD mentioned above but I saw a DRASTIC difference when I began to mix my foundations with primer. I have quite oily but flaky skin yeah its great so its very difficult for me to find something that doesnt melt off immediately but doesnt make me look like my skin is peeling off when I put it on either. For me mixing any siliconebased primer with any foundation whether water or silicone based will extend my wear time at least  hours and sure I get a bit less coverage but even normallycakey foundations are more agreeable to being layered on with primer so I just wait a few minutes and slather on another layer. The result for me is always a far more natural less flakecity finish and these days I cant imagine just putting foundation on without primer mixed in anymore.  I cant counsel you on whether cheap primers are ok or not because the only one Ive tried was Baby Skin and it broke me out into horrible zitties but maybe before discarding the idea of primer altogether try mixing it in with your foundation and see if it makes a bit of a difference for you? Oh and that Sephora SA was just trying to sell you stuff  Im sure in theory some primers are formulated to work with foundations from the same brand although Ive never found that to be the case tbh but your face isnt gonna fall off if you mix a drugstore primer with your MUFE!,RandomActsofMakeup,cgnk8oq,1,t5_2vigj

830708,0,t3_23nc8g,Welcome to RAOM! I second watching some YouTube tutorials. At the very least they can give you an idea of what products you might want to try and the order of application etc. If youre wondering what products to try first you should decide whether or not you want to wear foundation and then what coverage level youre comfortable with. BB creams offer sheerer coverage while there are some foundations that will give you very full coverage but wont look quite as natural in my opinion. Then Id decide on a mascara. Foundation and mascara are my two basics. Do you want natural looking lashes do you want length? Volume? Both? A lot of people myself included really like CoverGirl clump crusher but I also really like CoverGirl lash blast for an everyday mascara. You mentioned dark circles so youll want to find a good concealer. A lot of people like hard candy glamouflage though it didnt work for me. NYX makes some great concealers too. Before I buy any product I like to read a ton of reviews first. Makeup alley has reliable reviews and so do some retailer websites. Ill even go on YouTube and look up product name review and listen to a bunch of opinions before I make the plunge to buy a product. Id recommend first maybe asking your friend what products she used on you and start there. Then maybe head over to an ulta or sephora and ask for help finding a few basic products. Sephora will give you a sample of almost anything. Dont let them talk you into buying anything that you dont feel comfortable with! ,RandomActsofMakeup,cgypbvd,1,t5_2vigj

The way they mixed video game comic and film elements into the movie was awesome! The creator of the graphic novel Bryan Lee OMalley and the series is Canadian too Canada ftw! In the graphic novels the characters are obviously flawed which makes them easier to connect too because they seem more real despite the rest of the unreal content of the novels and movie This will be both of our first tattoos and so we wanted to get matching tattoos without them being the same thing so its partially a friendship thing too.Thats a lot of it its kind of hard to explain I guess?

I felt like I grew up while everything else stayed the same.  Your parents are happy for your company not because you are in town. So dont feel guilty. My advice is stay busy. I felt the worst sitting at home doing nothing. Help your parents out hang out with high school friends you are still in touch with maybe plan some weekend trips to visit college friends near by go swimming have picnics shopping hobbies ride bike try new recipes with your parents...whatever you like.

1085485,0,t1_chreazt,Mostly a natural look. Light brown eyeshadow clearish lip gloss. Foundation and concealer are big but super expensive cause Im really light skinned. I believe the excepted term is neon white. So I never know whether a foundation will work until I bring it home.

I mess mine up all the time and Ive been wearing cat eyes for almost  years. Kudos for the liner. Definitely good for your third time! My advice is to practice thinner toward the nose and thicker toward the corner which might save you from a prolonged period of panda eyes while you learn. You have lovely eyes so maybe play around with a gold pigment. That silver doesnt do the green hues justice!,RandomActsofMakeup,chrxv8n,1,t5_2vigj

1103963,0,t1_chtrqby,Their black eyeliner is decent has a bit of a weird smell but very affective. Similar to elf liner but has a felt like tip instead of the elf brush. The blush palettes are awesome but the shadows can be a little hit or miss especially without primer. The only exception to that rule the revealed palette is an amazing dupe for Naked one and two and very soft and pigmented. The brushes are awesome and have done amazing sets. The mystery box is beyond fun and comes with brushes often and you can buy it as much as you want but there runs a large risk to get multiple of the same thing. Their lip glosses are amazing and not sticky and their forever blushes are to die for. ,RandomActsofMakeup,chtrzkl,2,t5_2vigj

1125016,0,t1_chw5jzc,With your first post the tag of PSA wasnt correct and the mod spammed it for that reason. During the conversation she asked what you were looking to accomplish with the post. She then reached out to the mod team to see what would be the best fit for your post. During that time you posted again with a different tag. She did spam that one as well and the conversation continued. Your post wasnt really a PSA or a Discussion it was a vent about a bad experience you had at a store. Thats why as a team the vent thread was our suggestion. The purpose of the vent thread is pretty broad and not limited to nonmakeup related topics. Im not sure where the cliquey feeling is coming from in regards to being asked to post in the Vent thread. Of all the places on the sub the Vent and Share threads are probably the most welcoming threads to visit. Its everybody coming together in one area to support one another. They also serve the purpose of keeping the sub a little cleaner by having those type of posts in one place. I apologize that what happened struck a nerve with you. I promise that youre not the only one who has been asked to move their post to the Vent or Share threads. We want you to keep posting! We dont ever mind helping members with posts or guiding to the right spot.

I prefer to be hairless because I swear when I apply foundation the hair on my face is noticable. I either wax or thread threading is definitely the more painful method especially if you choose someone whos bad at it!

How can that be? you ask Well my moms side of the family decided a few years ago that Christmas itself was becoming unmanageable with cousins and grandchildren all living in different cities. Years would go by and one cousin or another would bail due to weatherother commitments and we just never seemed to all get together. Then Christmas in July happened. We all make it pretty much every year for BBQ and campfires and we all hang out longer than we would in winter. Its kinda awesome. So my favourite memory from this event was my little nieces arrival a few years ago. She showed up in an adorable new dress and just as all the aunts and uncles were rushing over to fawn over her she wailedannounced Im pooping!

Im thinking of branching into NYX or another brand but lipstick is probably what scares me the most! If youre into eye palettes Sleek makes really good ones!

1325157,0,t3_299e1i,I also have a work related story for this contest! When Im at school I work in my colleges game room quite the exciting job I know! as a desk attendant. The people who come in and out are extremely nice overall and are just there to pass timehang out with friends. The room is right down the hall from one of the computer labs in the building too. So one day last year a girl comes in to ask me for paper to refill one of the printers in the lab. I kindly explain to her that I do not have any paper that she could use in the printer and gave her an office to go up to to ask as well as the IT number so they could come down and refill it later in the day. She did not accept my help and began to get angry with me. This all ended up with her picking up one of the plastic sign holders that sits on top of my counterdesk thing and smashing it. Needless to say pieces flew everywhere and I was likely to spend the rest of my shift cleaning this up. I was so scared and was on the verge of tears throughout this whole thing. One of the guys who was in the game room got up and came over to help me clean up the pieces. He halfjokingly told me that the next time anything like that happened in here again hed be sure to beat anyone up for me. It was super sweet that he came over to help since they all usually keep to themselves. Although it was one of the scariest and most memorable days Ive had there it showed me that people really do care and are capable of doing nice things for people they dont knowdont know personally. Also my favorite drink from Starbucks is definitely the Passion Tea Lemonade. Their coffee is so good but that drink is just  amazing. Its an instant pickmeup every time I get it!Thanks for hosting this!!  EDIT adding in raffle word  Turkey. Gobble gobble everyone!  ,RandomActsofMakeup,ciip3uq,1,t5_2vigj

1335966,0,t3_29cs0x,Hey mellymel Im so sorry no one caught this earlier but I have to spam this discussion. There are parts of it which do constitute a great discussion  like which colors youve been wearing lately. However most of the comments are...well not about the question you asked. And Im sure right now you probably think Im a big ol bitch for spamming this but your announcement is better suited for the weekly share thread. Many of the women on our sub have suffered from fertility issues andor suffered through miscarriages and when the title says lets talk makeup they should feel confident that the discussion is gonna be about makeup. I have had members tell me its hard for them to see pregnancyrelated news outside of the Weekly Share Thread because it feels like everyone is getting pregnant except for them and we truly do want to make it a safe place for everyone. And while Im incredibly happy that you have successfully gotten pregnant I have to watch out for those who might be hurt by this discussion. Normally Id ask anyone with a rant or share in a discussion to edit it out but even if you did edit out the news about the baby most if not all of the comments are congratulatory so Id have to spam those as well.Again I am so so so sorry about having to spam this. Im in a really tough spot because your pregnancy and your feelings towards this pregnancy are definitely NOT spam worthy but the post doesnt fit the format for discussions on the sub. ,RandomActsofMakeup,cijwuzb,0,t5_2vigj

1366220,0,t1_cinjems,I actually disagree with some of this. Although to each their own!I own the Smashbox Full Exposure palette and I was extremely extremely disappointed in the eye shadow quality. Theyre not pigmented at all are incredibly difficult to pick up have to rub really hard to get anything at all for the shimmer shades and all of the different shades look really similar once theyre on your skin.

1544193,0,t1_cj9s3ad,I am not here to argue with you of course this is just a discussion. In the Asian beauty forums especially many girls feel that this subreddit is extremely hostile and closeminded and I also agree with this sentiment myself honestly because Ive seen a lot of ignorance regarding peoples attitudes toward the Asian beauty community. I mean this is makeupaddiction right? Not western makeup addiction. I think that a large part of it comes from the fact that western beauty really does have quite a few differences from Asian beauty. What the asianBeauty forums consider cool and trendy is often criticized or considered unkempt over here. I have seen people criticizing trends in the Asian beauty world for instance eyebrows is often brought up. A lot of people bash the straight eyebrow look for instance but for many Asian girls this is their natural shape it is also the prevalent and beautiful trend over there and there is also the social aspect that it is frowned upon to wear excessivefake looking makeup. Many girls dont realize that the straight eyebrow trend for instance comes out of necessity for school girls who want to wear makeup but will be told to take their makeup off if they attempt to wear the ultra shaped gradient eyebrow and makeup that western girls can easily wear without getting sent home. We hear a lot of misinformation about the Asian beauty community as well bb creams for instance and people dont seem to really be open to listening to alternative view points here. Its stuff like this I believe that makes people really cringe at makeupaddiction. I am not one of the people who shy away from this forum because of stuff like that but I know that many girls feel this way who are much shyer than I am and also girls who are already self conscious or afraid to post their face on the internet. I read quite frequently that girls join places like RandomActsofMakeup because theyre afraid of MA. Some girls fear posting different makeup looks because its not the western ideal some fear being criticized for not using the same techniques gradient eyebrows we like aegyosal etc they fear being criticized when they didnt even ask for CC and a lot of people are just scared of posting here because of the amount of hostility in comments downvoting and general snarkiness. I think if youre a seasoned veteran of this thread you may not even be phased by it anymore but for girls who are just beginning in makeup I can easily see why they would be so intimidated here. I dont get the same familycommunity vibe here that I get in smaller sub reddits. I do see a lot of negativity over positivity here. I dont think its right to kiss peoples ass when their makeup looks horrid of course but sometimes I feel like people here are so nitpicky about other peoples appearancemakeup I wonder whether they have any grasp on reality and what a person should really look like. Not everyone has the same skill level not everyone has the same tools and makeup I know CC is welcome by some but many people get scared away from here. When it comes down to it I think a lot of us girls who prefer our niche subs really just stay away from MA because it doesnt seem very different from the cliqueyness of Mean Girls. I probably wouldnt ever post my makeup here personally because I dont want to be told to do my eyebrows differently or to contour this part of my face or to use a different lip color than the one I like. Some people just want to share their joy with other people. I appreciate that about other subreddits. Anyway Im not trying to argue with you or whatever. Im just trying to offer some incite as to what I have heard and seen from many girls who were literally scared away from this community. ,RandomActsofMakeup,cj9u6sp,1,t5_2vigj

1560869,0,t1_cjbww5l,Oohh I love random questions! . What is your favorite quote?Someone shared this quote with me when I was going through a particularly trying time. It helped me stay strong and I continue to draw inspiration from it. In fact when I read the dedication on the art piece you made me it reminded me of this quote. ltThe most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat known suffering known struggle known loss and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation a sensitivity and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion gentleness and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen.  Elisabeth KblerRoss. If you could talk to your yo self what would you tell Lil Xtina? Dont work  focus on school.  Make healthy choices trust me its easier now then it will be down the road.  When youre something youre going to want to date someone you know dont do it. Everyone will be better off if you dont. . If you could eat one food everyday for the rest of your life without worry of diet restrictions what would it be? It can be the only food you eat or in addition to your regular diet.One of my absolute favorite dishes is this Asianinspired spicy popcorn chicken dish served at an Asian Fusion place here in my city. They serve it with fried rice and this yummmmy dipping sauce. Id have that every day if I could!! Such spicy! So flavor! Wow!,RandomActsofMakeup,cjbxeuz,2,t5_2vigj

1566192,0,t3_2c5vfz,Well overall I like to think in my next life I will be a cat because I have a lot of cat tendencies in my everyday life now. But if I had to choose what kind of cat I would be I would  be a Munchkin. Preferably in kitten form but adult form would be okay too  yknow since I have to grow up eventually.Here are my reasons why . They have little legs. I have little legs. Not much else to that one. I am roughly  depending on the day so I am much shorter than many of my friends family and my  foot tall boyfriend. My favorite thing to say when my boyfriend starts striding off ahead of me he cant help it the poor thing and his long legs is WAIT FOR ME I GOT LITTLE LEGS like Michelle Tanner. .  THEYRE SO FLUFFY!!!!!! Im fluffy. Theyre fluffy. Again not much else to say. . They have been known to talk a lot. Like the one in this video I talk all the time. Once you get me started on a topic its hard to get me to stop. This can also be considered crying. I cry a lot  and for no reason. I cry mainly while looking at Munchkins both the cat and the donut hole and catskittens in general. And Jake Gyllenhaal and John Krasinski... See what I mean? I cry and cant stop talking... For bonus cutes because I cant not share this video heres a Munchkin popping a water balloon Thanks for hosting!!,RandomActsofMakeup,cjclg9q,3,t5_2vigj

1606009,0,t1_cjg2rwp,I know how frustrating that can be. My BF responds the same way when he is upset. It took and still takes a lot of time and patience for me to be able to handle this when we are arguing. Im totally the lets talk about our feelings for hours until we love each other again type where hes like feelings? What feelings? People process things differently which if its not the same way as you do can be so infuriating and especially if what youre arguing over is something related to an insecurity or abandonment issue can be doubly shitty. My best advice is to pick a time when you are not fighting oddly sometimes this works best over the phone in my case and discuss how his responses make you feel and see if you can figure out a way where both your needs can be met you feel heard and acknowledged and hes able to internalize what he needs to to work out his issues alone. Maybe that will help its helped with me and my BF immensely. Though its tough in the moment sometimes to remember that ,RandomActsofMakeup,cjhlst6,1,t5_2vigj

I finally got the information for my training this week and its the hours I expected so everything will work out nicely. However I also learned that I need to provide some school supplies as a welcome gift for my  students on the first day of class. This is completely out of pocket and is mandatory  the choice of supplies is left up to us but we at least need to include a pen a pencil and a highlighter. Seriously? Why couldnt you have told me this earlier!? Im scrambling to buy my school supplies that I need for myself nevermind my peer mentor kids. So thats at least going to be  for them and likely another  for me. I have pencils for them as I was going to do a cute thing on Pinterest that I found but all of the extras I now have to provide arent going to be cheap. If they at least provided us with some stuff and told us to do something creative with it or add products at will Id be more okay with it! But this just irks me and stresses me out even more. I just dont know how Im going to pull this off. I dont want to disappoint anyone seeing as this is my first year and Id really like to do it again next year for my last semester in school. But I can barely afford my tuition and supplies nevermind buying school supplies for someone else who probably already has the stuff. Im panicking about this whole experience and it hasnt even started yet. I also have to buy my own supplies again out of pocket for the two events I have to put on during the semester too. Granted that is further down the road but it is another expense that isnt covered. I dont get paid enough to put up with this BS!!! The biggest stressor in my life right now hands down is my boyfriend. He has been getting on my nerves a lot lately  and its just driving me nuts. He has a lot of financial problems himself more than I do but he spends money more freely than I do. And by spending money I really mean it  like extensive amounts that he barely has. He does have a summer job that pays unlike mine but he also has to help pay the bills for his household  as his dad was unemployed for a while. Whatever thats fine be responsible and experience adult life. However he just bought a car today that he has NO plans on driving for at least TEN MORE MONTHS. He isnt planning on registering itgetting insuranceetc until next summer!! He got a really good deal on it and is going to maintain it and drive it next summer when he has money. LMFAO OKAY. So he means its going to sit in his driveway unused because it has no registration and nobody can drive it to keep it running. So despite his knowledge he just emptied his bank account for nothing. He just got his license last year and hasnt driven since then  and even then he barely passed and was told he shouldnt drive alone until he was more experienced. So again thanks for wasting your money on something thats not going to be used! He thinks Im mad because I dont have my own car because I cant afford the insurance on my own. No Im mad because hes so fucking frivolous with his money and doesnt realize that purchasing a car right now wasnt the best thing he could have done. Especially if he has no plans on driving it any time soon. Someone else could have benefitted from that car but no hes keeping it to rot in the driveway. I hate coming here and venting but with him refusing to talk to me civilly and with everyone else I know stuck in RA training all day I had no other option. Im just sick of the BS today. I hate being financially unstable. I hate when people get things that they dont deserve as selfish as that makes me sound. I am just so fing frustrated Im shaking. Ugghh!!!! Im done I promise. lol ,RandomActsofMakeup,cjn9bvb,1,t5_2vigj

1814012,0,t3_2fa4bk,Super cute hair! The only CC I might have is to blend the darker colors on your eyes just a bit more at the edges. The edges are a bit abrupt. I like your face makeup a lot. It looks nice and smooth but still light enough to look really natural and to let your freckles show through.,RandomActsofMakeup,ck7rp91,1,t5_2vigj

Another alternative is if you have an old nintendo or other gaming system bust that out and have a marathon day.  Work together to beat Castlevania or take turns playing levels on Donkey Kong Country!If you are in an area that stays warm into September and October they may still have snow cone stands working at that time.

1965535,0,t3_2h4zly,uzebratwat was the first to glam me and it was awesome! I had been around for a while and entered a billion contests even ones that I wasnt eligible for I did the challenges because they were fun and just excused myself from the actual competition and hadnt won anything. I entered her contest about designing a makeup collection based off an artist and I did mine on Billie Holiday. She ended up sending me the Balm Balm Jovi palette which was at the time the nicest piece of makeup I owed! As a brokeass grad student I felt so spoiled and I was amazed to see how much more I felt part of the community after that. Its kinda weird how glamming is so much more than giftgiving its like a symbol saying ONE OF US!!!! and acknowledge your acceptance to the group and showing appreciation. I cant wait until I have some extra funds I want to do a really big glam for someone!

1996993,0,t3_2fod5i,I made this lemon garlicthyme and mushroom pasta last night. It took about  minutes to make  Its technically a  panpot dish but....its quick and easy! And also incredibly delicious   I went back and had seconds. I altered Nigellas recipe a bit by opting to saute the mushrooms with the garlic thyme and olive oil simply because raw mushrooms dont appeal to me. I also threw in some cherry tomatoes in the pan and they ended up being great in this dish. I think pine nuts would also be a great addition to this recipe.,RandomActsofMakeup,cktu65v,1,t5_2vigj

2049266,0,t3_2i9wu7,So in my opinion I would stay away from those super huge palettes like with  color from ELF and BH cosmetics because they are generally very cheap but they  arent super pigmented and  have tons of fallout and dont last very long during the day. They are also difficult to blend. Like I said though thats just my opinion! I think that if youre going to splurge for yourself on a palette for sure go with the Lorac Pro or Too Faced Chocolate Bar  I own both of them and absolutely LOVE them. They both include a nice range of neutrals with some pops of color so theyre awesome for every day wear. Let me know if you have any other questions! ,RandomActsofMakeup,cl0b1rz,2,t5_2vigj

The Macarena had hit and it hit HARD and my  friends and I decided that we were going to form a girl band  i.e. dance and lipsync to the Macarena in front of the entire camp and whichever parents were around.So were decked out in the most ridiculous costumes just imagine what you as an  year old thought was sexy. We hit play on the boom box and were dancing on our makeshift stage which is just a grassy field behind the main building. On the nd round of HEEEEY MACARENA I skip jump twirl and fall straight on my ass. IN A PILE OF DOG SHIT. The adrenaline is running so high I dont even realize that my ass is literally covered in puppy feces and I just keep pop and locking to high heaven to the best of my  year old ability. They called me Poop Butt for weeks Obviously not the cleverest when it came to namecalling. And yes. My parents have photos.,RandomActsofMakeup,clab0zj,1,t5_2vigj

Sometimes I dont have time to try a look because its holiday madness where I live and I work  hours a week so my window to do those is sometimes horribly limited. Not that I dislike them mind you! Just not always able to find the time.In Australia we tend to mostly shop online and have it shipped over due to the limited brands so places like beautybay.com and so on have a special place in my heart.

2643972,0,t3_2pmw3b,. I am kinda glad  is going to be over because I learned a lot this year and a lot has happened so Im pretty stoked to see whats going to happen in the near future.. My New Years resolution is to not be spiteful. I hold grudges and it just makes me more angry and upset then anything else but its hard for me to stop.. The best thing My significant others family finally accepting me. Its been  years and they are old fashion religious folks who believe all women should be home makers and be subordinate to their husbands. They did not like the idea that Im going to college and I didnt want to get married at the age of  and have children right away like the other women did in their family. I want to settle down one day and have children but not yet. The worst thing My dad being diagnosed with lung cancer. He lost his parents at a young age escaped his home country and left his family behind during the war to have a better life in America. He has always been so strong and tough in my eyes and to see him in the hospital bed completely drugged up breaks a daddys girls heart. He just had his surgery and were still waiting for results. I dont know maybe  will actually be a bad year but heres hoping that it wont be.. Most cherished memory from this year I was sleeping over my significant others house and I had a nightmare. I remember waking up with a start like almost jumping and my significant others arms wrapped around me tightly and he kissed me on the head. It made me feel safer and my nightmare disappeared. . Biggest life lesson? Its okay to cry. A lot happened this year and I kinda just punched a wall and tree and then acted like nothing was wrong. After my dad was diagnosed I was driving to class and I just started bawling my eyes out. I pulled over the car and started to kick rocks and just tried making myself angry. At least with anger I can push myself to do more things. With sadness I feel completely incapable of doing anything at all. I called my s.o and he just told me its okay to cry hes your dad. and I just sat in my car and cried. I know I cant actually fight the battle for him but I can at least be strong and supportive around him. . Well duh Imma tackle the crap out of my s.o and smother him with kisses. His pale skin stands no chance against my dark lipstick kisses.. Probably not. We tried going to a huge club party last year and that sucked. Parking sucked. Music sucked. Too many drunk people. We were thinking of doing a small gathering but probably wont. my s.o thinks I want to go out because I do like dancing but I dont like drunk people so we might just watch netflix with each other like we usually do.. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO GRADUATING COLLEGE! Ive been in college since I was  and Ill be graduating at the age of . Its not like I took a break or anything I just had no idea what I was doing and if youre paying yourself through college its sucks so much more.. I think a lot of things are funny so I cant even choose. My room mate and I will randomly say the same thing in sync when other people around without thinking about it or trying. Im currently wearing a tank top my other best friend got me that says feed me and tell me im pretty. Just last week we went to a club event and a really drunk girl ran and jumped on my handicap friends legs and broke his wheel chair. We all started laughing while this girl is hysterically crying. We told her its okay thankfully his legs are already broken. She ended up crying harder because I guess she didnt understand our sense of humor. . I work at a gym. I have no excuse to why I cant lose those  pesky pounds besides I love food,RandomActsofMakeup,cn3p73o,2,t5_2vigj

2663953,0,t1_cn4qh81,Twas the night before Christmas and while all the Raomers were sleeping Grinchela and Skroogette were planning their attack! Grinchela put on her bronzer and Groot outfit and was looking Fuzzy! Skroogette squeezed into her Tiana costume slathered her trusty Lash Curler all over her armpit and they prepared to sneak into all the Raomers sticky houses. Egad! Said the pair as they put on their gooey disguises and collected their marbles to get ready for the heist.Grinchela and Skroogette got into their hoverboard to start traveling to gandalfdawhite house. It didnt matter if each member was naughty or skinny everyone was going to be a victim of the chalky pair!But wait letttuceB and ellewoods stumbled upon a post in a secret sub with details of the plot! Crapnuggets!! said LettuceB and  ellewoods we must save our friends from the evil duo! LettuceBput on her primer and ellewoods smeared liquid line all over and together they gathered their stocking to intercept the aggresive pair and save all of RaOM. They caught up with Grinchela and Skroogette at uirunondietcokes house and started singing Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle to confuse them and then tied them up with cheese. They were able to save Christmas and return all of the makeup and bricks to the kind Raom members and return Raom to its safe and damp state.Once Grinchela and Skroogette were successfully captured uBlanksy  and uroseatesg were ready to banish them forever from Raom! But first we must take off your oily disguises and reveal your true identity. uBlanksy and uroseatesg grabbed the pair by the wenis and removed the disguises to find that Grinchela and Skroogette were none other than AuntyM and lilpeedee! Aunty and Peedee begged to be forgiven and not banned. The mods agreed but only if they return all the handcuffs they stole and vow to never to do evil deeds again. The infected duo agreed with fingers crossed behind their backs and figured if they get banned they can just keep creating new accounts to fool everyone again.,RandomActsofMakeup,cn6azu2,2,t5_2vigj

5000159,0,t3_3jcsu3,I think a more natural color on the waterline would look a lot better the white is harsh.  Maybe Wonder Pencil from NYX or similar. Also I think your winged liner would look a lot cleaner if you used  fine pointed liner brush like Bdellium . I saw in your comments that you like a smaller wing and that will make it easier to make it small but still clean looking. you can get right in there for fine lines or do a bold wing. ,RandomActsofMakeup,cuopg1o,1,t5_2vigj

7657597,0,t3_4k6vvo,Alright so mini reviewI LOVE this stuff and will no longer put on lipstick without it! For me I have an intense tingling sensation for about  to  minutes. After that it simply feels like lip gloss. I lightly exfoliate my lips before applying the Lip Injection. I cannot stress the lightly part enough. It is also important to stay within the boundaries of your lips so that you dont cause redness the the surround skin. I have been told by others that this was NOT their experience and that the tingling was more painful for them. If you choose to try this and you have a strong reaction I urge you to stop using it. Its not worth the allergic reaction and potential damage you could do. However if you are as fortunate as I am to have a mild reaction then I highly recommend this! lt ,RandomActsofMakeup,d3cmjl9,3,t5_2vigj

10526351,0,t1_dd198x2,My glasses are all prescription.  I take the lenses out of them and then bring them into my optometrists office.  I dont have vision insurance so it cuts the costs way way down for me so that I can spend a bit extra on glare proofscratch resistant lenses and a one year warranty.  I sort of have a thing for glasses so getting them second hand makes it much easier for me to have multiple pairs as far as price goes too.  A lot of people dont realize that an optometrist will put your prescription into a frame even if you dont buy them there but they never seem to mind.  In fact the optician that adjusts them to my face enjoys seeing the vintage frames I find. Im excited for my match to get their package too.  shopping for them has been a lot of fun.,RandomActsofMakeup,dd19yqb,2,t5_2vigj
