4231075,0,t1_cs2ir5b,Been training for near  years I understand avoidance. I never said that Id stab someone and claim self defence. In the court of law its not how it works. Equal force  Self defence otherwise its generally not a good time. If someone attacks me with a knife I get it away from him and stick him in the process thats self defence. If I attack someone with a knife for punching me in the face thats assault with a deadly weapon. Either way I dont carry a knife for self defence I carry one as a tool. People who carry knives for self defence rarely understand that using a knife against someone isnt easy nor is it a good idea in particular. By escalating the situation youre inviting the other person to do the same. Never bring a knife to a gun fight type of thing. ,manprovement,cs2izrr,2,t5_2sdef
4270268,0,t1_cs6yy97,gt Getting ahead means a great many things. Ive noticed a certain lack of discussion in such areas as ecosustainability like homesteadingprepping discussions on what masculinity was is and could be like in rasianmasculinity  on spiritualiy and how that has an affect one ones life and implementation of certain goals like education.Two things. rAsianMasculinity has a very narrow definition of Asian that excludes most of the continent. I was chased out of there for reminding them that India is as part of Asia as China is for example. . I was using getting ahead as being seen as a part of larger society not anything else. I would like to reach the stage where Im not seen as the other in society and am making my best effort to ensure this isnt the case these efforts are labelled by some as selling out btw. Eventually I would like to be seen as just another person and not as a CATEGORY.gt Surely racism is a great issue in the lives of everyone. But the hyperfocus on it  this late in the game for humanity  is to me detrimental. It is one problem among many which can and should be solved in harmony with many many other issues.The problem arises if someone doesnt have anything else to define themselves as other than their race. As I said above my forefathers were Arab but I am also a boyfriend a university graduate a chess player and a football fan to name a few other identities I hold right now. If I were to  forget these and see myself as any one of the above when that identity gets attacked I will lash out.,manprovement,cs6z5x9,1,t5_2sdef

4879071,0,t3_3hppq5,I disagree on the used cars if only because my experience and Im pretty damned handy with a wrench has been that the cost of maintenance over the long term is roughly the same as the cost of a small loan for a new car. Im not talking about simple oil changes. Im talking timing belt changes complete brake jobs electrical issues suspension issues AC blowing out engine work and the always present threat of the damned thing finally just crapping out on you. I can spend k and get a car that will eventually blow up on me spending roughly  or  a month on maintenance and time spent fixing it or get a newer car from a dealership and pay around  a month on a loan. Just my two cents gained from nearly  years of dealing with shitty automobiles. edit For those of us who arent as good with a wrench the costs can easily double. Mechanics stay in business because people think that saving money in the short term on a used car is preferable to saving money in the long term on a dependable newer vehicle. Im not saying blow k on a brand new neondodge dart oops but taking a  to k loan on a car with monthly payments around  to  WITHOUT the need for hardcore maintenance is a pretty smart investment.,manprovement,cu9jm9b,2,t5_2sdef
