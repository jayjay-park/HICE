2850021,0,t3_2skbuv,Ive noticed this on most of the more popular female dominated subs. Its an odd trend to me. Im not sure what the cause is. I sometimes feel like I missed the memo on How to be a Girl on the Internet.I really appreciate subs like MUAcirclejerk because I can find likeminded people who are weirded out by the sugarysweetwereallbffs culture. Where we can crack jokes and be sarcastic without offending somebody. I understand being polite but the rules of some of these subs take it to a level beyond common courtesy. Dissenting opinions even when theyre sandwiched in between phony compliments are labeled rude or my personal favorite snarky and down voted immensely. Like someone in MUA mentioned if you cant handle other peoples opinions then maybe you lack the emotional maturity to post your face on the internet.I dont usually type out this much on a reddit post but this is something I have been thinking about lately. Is the culture of subs like MUA representative of our expectations of women? Like am I getting a view into the mindset of greater society where women are supposed to be pleasant at all times and blunt honesty and assertiveness are negative qualities?

3219686,0,t1_covp8od,I feel a little silly for not checking with Google before demanding answers from you!  A quick Google search revealed  Once key product characteristics have been determined shelflife or stability testing can be undertaken either in accelerated fashion or in realtime. Accelerated shelflife studies are done at elevated temperatures whereas realtime shelflife studies are done at room temperatures. Regardless of the test method chosen Cosmetic Test Labs tailors each shelflife study to each customer and product.Accelerated shelflife studies and realtime stability studies often yield similar data to companies. The obvious advantage of accelerated studies is the time saved in testing. The advantage of realtime shelflife studies is similarity to real product life. As a general rule  weeks of storage at  degrees C F is equivalent to about  year of shelf life.   However it doesnt really say much about stressing the product by testing it after leaving it in lessthanideal situations for the time frame that said product is meant to last for. ,muacjdiscussion,covq14p,1,t5_342em

3436758,0,t3_2ya0tr,I used to work at sephora and when sales were down they sent people home. There was almost never enough coverage. They have dailytohourly goals and they are always trying to spend less and make more than last year. Sometimes itd just be me and  other girl in color if that and wed get swamped out of nowhere. And the people who have to wait  minutes would get all up in my grill.  minutes is not an exaggeration either managers pressured us to help people and move on in  minutes. Most of the time it takes over  minutes for these flippin people to explain what they are looking for. I was a hard worker and I was never snotty but people would still get crazy complain about me and act like I was ignoring them or something. You try to mitigate the amount of time needy clients want you to spend with them but then they complain on surveysto managers about feeling rushed. Sorry bitch I am only one person.  Its a serious plate spinning project to help some people and the INCREDIBLE amount of handholding they need is baffling. Im sorry I cant be your personal stylist and psychiatrist right at this fuckin moment. I am a human being Im just trying to make it through the day just like you are. Of course Im going to put on my happy face and do the job Im here to do but I am not your slave and I dont live to serve you. Im doing this job to help you find what you need in an immediate sense what you need is probably some therapy but PLEASE stop projecting your own dissatisfaction with your own appearance on ME. It is makeup and it can be transformative but have reasonable expectations. Which brings me to another point. Youtubesocial media gurus have severely distorted what peoples expectations of a makeup product are. Ever filmed yourself with good natural sunlight thru a window on a digital camera? That shit eats up pores and blemishes and texture. Not to mention all the insane retouching that goes on. I am a shop girl with less than  minutes to spend on you Im sorry I cant make you look like your favorite guru by slathering on some magical dust in a jar. Lastly you spend ALL day asking people if they need help. Sometimes people get annoyed but thats what we are instructed to do. But sometimes the store gets full. I am speaking to probably  strangers in one day. I cant always remember faces did I ask that person already? Are they going to feel badgered or like Im profiling them for stealing if I ask them again? Sometimes people want to browse in peace but then they get a wild hair up their ass that they need help in that second and I am not reading their mind. Or worse they ask for help and I am running around grabbing things for other people and they feel ignored now. What about all those times I asked you if you needed help? Obviously some people are going to fall through the cracks its only natural so Im not saying Im NEVER at fault here. I often would get brain scrambled and space out for a minute after talking about foundation finishes and coverage for  hours straight. But retail workers deserve a little compassion. ,muacjdiscussion,cpk0kxi,1,t5_342em

4042157,0,t1_crgwe5l,My eyelids are hooded and oily so most shadows either crease or transfer on me. Fyrinnaes formula is semiloose because it has a lot more binding ingredients in them  this makes them more likely to adhere to the eyelid be more vibrant and stay put. Other shadows Ive tried can be a little powdery but perform well enough with a primer  but I shouldnt have to always rely on the primer to do all the work you know?A good formula for me is one that lasts more than a few hours without needing a primer. I try to look for swatch posts that show how shadows apply without a primer and make my purchasing decisions from there.Personally and YMMV on these my favourite formulas are Fyrinnae and Femme Fatale. Femme Fatale has a lovely velvety application that is close to Fyrinnaes HG application  both Fyrinnae and FF last on me. FF formula is not as good as Fyrinnaes but they are good at duochromes aka you dont have to use so much primer or glitter glue if at all to get the duochrome effect like you do with other shadows. Blackbirds matte formula is also A because you dont need a primer last all day and they are waterresistant to some extent.Hope that helps! ,muacjdiscussion,crh1c35,2,t5_342em

Its like people are trying to fix the problem and youre still complaining that the problem exists in the first place. Thats just not very productive in my opinion. Im not trying to invalidate your experiences just pointing out what I see as flaws in your logic. Obviously were not going to see eye to eye on this so why dont we just agree to disagree?,muacjdiscussion,crr1cjj,9,t5_342em

If someone can afford and has the desire and spaceetc to own every palette known to man then sure thing knock yourself out. Hell even if you dont have those things its not my place to dictate what people do. But as I said earlier I see so many stories on rMakeupRehab people who dont have the space who cant afford it it makes me sad to see them battling with this urge for completion to own every mainstream product to acquire more and more to either fill some void of keep up with the Jones.I feel very much the same way about gaming particularly through steam. I myself have a plethora of games Ive never even installed. Fortunately Ive never spent more than  on a single game and they obviously take up no physical space.

4511571,0,t3_3csjf1,Totally late to the party but thats okay. Im most excited lately that Ive lost  pounds since March! My normal weight hovers between  but Ive slowly gained about  pounds over the past  years. Went to the doctor in January and weighed in at . lb. Ouch that hurt to see. But I didnt make any changes until I weighed myself in March I dont have a scale at home and saw that I had gotten up to . Thats when it hit me that I had actually gained  fucking pounds and I was NOT happy about it. I felt bad I looked bad I felt bad because I looked bad. Soooo my boyfriend and I decided to kind of completely overhaul our diets. We cut down on portions junk food I could eat chips all day every day and sweets. We still treat ourselves and dont cut anything off completely so it really hasnt been so bad and weve kept up with it for months now.As far as exercising I cant recommend the ClubFitz channel on YouTube enough! I dont have a gym nearby so I knew I had to do something at home. I HATEHATEHATE running which is why Ive never been able to keep up with it not that its the best cardio anyway but its highly accessible and easy to start with. Then it hit me one day DANCE! ClubFitz has over  dancebased exercise videos and all the dances are great. I even look forward to doing my dance workouts which is something I never imagined I would do. As an added bonus my persistent back pain has pretty much disappeared since I started exercising regularly. So for anyone who has a hard time working out and likes dancing TRY THIS CHANNEL!!!! I use Chromecast to cast it on my TV from my phone but you could just as easily do it from a laptop. Im a little annoyed now that Im temporarily working  jobs totaling  hours a week so I havent been able to do my dances as often as Id like.

4820265,0,t1_cu1h33c,gt Maybe Im just picking out all the wrong products. Better luck nyx time I guess Haha!But honestly you may be onto something. NYX is hit or miss for me too mostly miss. Their eyeshadows are terrible. In fact most of their eye products are terrible for memascaras liners shadows primers etc. The lip creams you mentioned were a big disappointment for me and I dont see what people love about them though it may be a case of inconsistency between colors I have used and those being reviewed. Dont like their bbs primers or foundations. But when I find good products they become staples for me.I love their round case lipsticks to pieces. Also dig the matte lip colors stick not liquid. Their compact blushes are my goto well pigmented without coming on too strong last well lots of color options. The pigments Ultra Pearl Mania have a limited color range but go on strong and come in a reasonable form factor and price compared to other brands. Their studio finishing powder is nearly nearly! not quite a dupe for MUFE HD Finishing Powder for a lot less moolah.I agree the jumbo eye pencils are a bit dry if used straight from the pencil itself but I use the warmth of my hand or finger to emulsify it a bit then put on and it goes on great and stays well with limited creasingslipping. Really pops the colors and its so damn cheap.Other exceptions to my opinion that the eye stuff sucks with NYX Their retractable waterproof eyeliner pencils are actually pretty good and last most of the day and the Studio Liquid liner has been great for my dancers I am a dance performer and isntructor who perform and sweat a lotit really stays and comes in fun colors.Also their Wonder Pencil works great for me as a reverse lip liner and highlighter.

However the breakdown is such Eyeshadows palettes amp singles   Other eye products primers brow products mascaras   lip products lipsticks balms primers and liners   face products highlight foundation powder blushes contour setting spray concealer   tools brushes beauty blender  The main bit missing is eyeliners half of them are from various UD sets so I have to look them all up individually to figure out if I bought them at full price or they were a set exclusive so I havent quite got around to finishing that section. Without eyeliners though the total is . Im guessing the eyeliners will be something like ish so were looking at a total of .Im not too surprised by the total or by the breakdown. Eyeshadows were where I focused a lot of my attention in the beginning and my focus sort of switched to lips when I started to feel satisfied with the number of eyeshadows I had. I feel less of a need to experiment with face products besides blush although that collection feels pretty complete at this point too. My neutralolive undertones make finding a foundation a total bitch so Im happy with just one and I dont feel the need to experiment any further in regards to stuff like primers. I havent gotten around to delving into the world of highend brushes so that total is pretty much what Id expect for the amount of midrange brushes I have. Im trying to build a more cultivated collection of only products I love so I lurk in makeup rehab a fair bit. However Im not too fussed about sticking to a strict budget I generally dont have an issue not buying things when I dont have the money for them or limiting myself to certain numbers of products I have plenty of storage in my vanity. Regardless Ive destashed a fair bit to get to this point  not like halving my collection or anything but Ive been going category by category and trying to get rid of what I honestly dont use. Overall Im pretty happy with my collection and I only buy things sporadically now  sometimes there will be a month with several new releases I want other months I dont spend anything at all. ,muacjdiscussion,cunt5vt,2,t5_342em

I interpret contouring as a makeup application used to make ones face seem more feminine  you are accusing contouring of only being used to make your face to resemble white features.

Now there are complaints that theres too much CC. You cant please everyone so I just err on the side of caution.

Lately she keeps eyeing purple lipsticks though.I never really had a love of makeup from my mom. When I as a kid I was a serious tomboy. I think I vowed to myself at age  to never even get my ears pierced  years later I have  ear piercings total. The first time I wore makeup I think was to my eighth grade formal. My mom let me use hers but I had no idea what any product was for and her skin was a little darker than mine. I ended up with a slightly orangey hue which I proceeded to cover with blush all over the place. I dont remember it looking bad but I dont think I would have noticed. I got into makeup on my own a while later first to cover my acne but also for other general confidence issues. It was the first time in my life I ever felt pretty.

6307503,0,t3_420dhb,I think it depends on your skill level a bit too.When you get reasonably experienced you realize that a majority of eyeshadow techniques as an example use the same couple of basic skills and a lot of the same placement patterns. As for things like winged liner when youre experienced you most likely have your own method you like so yet another winged liner tutorial is useless to you and things like the tape trick may seem cumbersome. Theres the occasional technique that catches my eye and changes how I do things but that comes along a lot less frequently now that I have a lot of experience.So when I see someone post OMG tutorial plzzz it seems obvious how it was done and theres no need for a tutorial... But a few years ago when I had less experience with makeup and hadnt realized most things use the same basic skills maybe I would have wanted a tutorial.Semi related I think something similar happens with palette releases. When youve been in the makeupobsessed world for a couple of years and maybe hit Rouge a time or two most palettes seem really ho hum. I see a lot of sentiments like Why do companies think we need  neutral palettes in our arsenal? But the targeted consumer isnt always someone whos spent a cumulative  at Sephora over the past four years a lot of their sales probably come from people who have two or fewer eyeshadow palettes and a collection that is a small fraction of the collection the average MUA user has.,muacjdiscussion,cz6lbn8,100,t5_342em

6348430,0,t3_42lop6,From what I can tell the main difference is that on your wedding day everyone is looking at you and there will be picturesvideos galore which will last for eternity. Therefore its very important that your makeup looks good and lasts the entire day even if cryingsweatingrain occurs. I did my own makeup on my wedding day I had my nails and hair done because I suck at those and in the weeks before I played with a lot of different looks neutral and tested out the longevity of the look. My wedding day makeup turned out great and lasted all day. Although now that I look at my wedding pictures there arent any closeups at all and slight imperfections would not have been detected by the camera. ,muacjdiscussion,czb8usl,5,t5_342em
6350749,0,t1_cza9gtw,Hi!   I had the same exciting Stridex Red Box experience.   It was exactly a year ago this month and it royally fucked up my skin.   The worst thing is that once redness amp breakouts got worse I kept going because thats what purging looks like and SCA subreddit kept preaching to just get through it.   Worst idea of my life!   To be fair boyfriend told me not to use the Stridex and that it was way too harsh.   Anyway  the HG solution to all of this and the lingering redness which has taken  months to resolve no joke is quality Vitamin C serum.   Im using the Paulas Choice C Booster  because it contains a cocktail of Ascorbic Acid Ferulic Acid and Lactic Acids and it works incredibly well at fading redness amp healing PIH.   Apply at night to clean skin and let sit for at least min to work its magic.  And it did NOT break out my sensitive skin.   ,muacjdiscussion,czbicwn,2,t5_342em

6440880,0,t3_43du6o,New loves Innisfree NoSebum Powder LOOSE I have SUCH oily skin the only thing that prevents oil breakthrough is Estee Lauder Doublewear but the coverage is too flat and claylike so I tend to stick to other formulas that sadly get slippery by the end of the day. I have been using a powder from indie company Dreamworld Hermetica for almost a year now but even though I loved the color and finish it never seemed to mitigate oil breakthrough. The Innisfree is phenomenal truly the best powder Ive tried. It applies very sheerly and has a softfocus finish but I didnt even realize how great it was until I started taking selfies at lunch  hr after makeup application and realized that my chin which is usually creased and oily by noon was COMPLETELY matte and the foundation was intact. Mehdislikes I have gotten on a kick of revisiting old favorite formulas because I paid a LOT more attention to my makeup in high school than I did in the last few years of my early s. So I am going back to old favorites like UD  eyeliner in Rockstar still love it and stuff like lip stains. Yeah I discovered that lip stains suck now. Its either that my lips were smoother as a teenager or I was less picky about lipcolorfinish. Every single formula Ive tried is patchy and shitty and gives a terrible effect. I realize now that applying a cream or matte lipcolor with a lip brush and sheering the formula out gives me the right finish and longevity without the patchiness. But now I have a Vincent Longo Lip amp Cheek stain that I hate and my cheeks are a bit too brokenout to attempt anything but powder blush. Standbys MAC Pro Longwear Concealer Ive been using this for a few months now and it just keeps getting better the more I get to know the formula. Its dry stiff and highcoverage perfect for my acneic oily skin. I have the best results so far applying with my fingers and building in layers. Unfortunately I am between shades NC amp NC and I cant get away with applying one or the other without mixing. Combined with the pump which dispenses a LOT of product at once applicationcolormatch can be hit or miss depending on how much Im rushing that day.,muacjdiscussion,czlixzm,2,t5_342em

6518921,0,t3_44qpz3,Just my two cents   .   Many if not most western moisturizers contain fatty alcohols cetyl alcohol cetearyl alcohol and so on.   These break me out.   Badly.   Many people are completely unaffected by these ingredients but my skin responds with cystic acne without fail.   It took me until my late s to figure this out and find alternate products  for the decade of most of my s I used no moisturizer altogether.   Like you!  .  Most if not all cleansers are at a far too basic PH level to be healthy for your skin.   That could be one reason why youve struggled with acne for your entire life.   The natural PH of skin is slightly acidic.   Soap products and cleansing molecules are typically very basic.   Thats great for washing clothes but far too rough on skin.    Like you I struggled in my teens and then gained nearperfect skin in my earlymid s because I stopped cleansing with anything other than water.   I dont recommend this for anyone especially those of us who wear makeup!   What I do recommend is a PHbalanced cleanser such as the CosRX Good Morning Low PH Cleanser   Thats my two cents.   With those two changes you could be on your way to better skin!    Have you tried adjusting for these potential issues?,muacjdiscussion,cztlvkf,3,t5_342em

6772980,0,t1_d0jyqyz,I am saying that I find people watering down abuse worse than those joking about it.  I think the consequences of associating abuse with normal behavior is similar to people who dislike food saying they have an allergy. It makes those who are truly affected be taken less seriously. In contrast jokes about falling down stairs doesnt mean the topic is taken less seriously when someone claims they fell down stairs. Their humor might not be yours. It might be offensive or crude but it is just a joke. And while there are negative sides to it in some cases I think jokes like these are helpful because they establish and spread a language of abuse that abusees can use or learn from. Having both fallen down the stairs and fallen down stairs I can at least in my experience vouche that that phrase is taken very seriously in reality.I guess my point is that while this thread is demonizing these people I think that others within MUA FFA xx suggesting abuse for everything in a nonironic or humorous manner more detrimental and for me more offensive. ,muacjdiscussion,d0jzzvz,8,t5_342em
6773779,0,t3_48hbye,Personally I found them funny they made me giggle. But I have a pretty dark sense of humour. I have experienced abuse so I am not some ignorant sheltered little girl. I just find that poking fun at a situation makes it more bearable to me. Humor is my therapy of choice and while I understand it is not everyones cup of tea no one meant any harm. Edit Wanted to add that it has nothing to do with tearing other women down or being in denial I think some things just need to be taken at face value and not analysed to death. Like in English class at high school where the teacher would go on and on about the meaning of every little thing when more than likely there was no deeper meaning. This was just some word play and while it is a delicate subject matter I dont think they were commenting on excusing a partners abuse or victim blaming. ,muacjdiscussion,d0k39uy,14,t5_342em

Makeup shopping whatever other stereotypically girly thing you can think of is viewed of as immature simply because its feminine. Its an easy thing to pick out and attack simply because its so pervasively and invisibly ingrained in our society. So when someone feels threatened or that they need to prove themselves or anything like that  femininity is going to be the first thing they attack. And mothers come with a whole bunch of extra stuff that I dont fully understand but all of a sudden your body and your time isnt really your own anymore and youre dealing with trying to uphold your ideas of individuality at the same time as trying to raise some brand spankin new human beings. Everyones feeling insecure about their abilities and jealous of everyone else and that manifests as trying to bring others down to pull yourself up. Or prove that youre the Best Mom by showing that others are Bad Moms. Additionally for whatever reason motherhood seems to be not a private event but a public occasion. Everyone can offer any advice at any time and apparently advice includes passive aggressive comments in which you can practically feel the sideeye.And boy oh boy am I LOVING the dichotomy between advice for her and her husband. Mother? DROP FUCKING EVERYTHING YOU ARE NOW YOUR CHILD. Father? Oh sweet sugar loaf take a load off. Dont get me started on it.I hope you sent your friend a message letting her know that at least one person doesnt agree with those comments  you might not want to make a big thing out of it on her page but Im sure itll mean the world to her to let her know that theres someone on her side and that she shouldnt have an ounce of selfdoubt due to those careless and hurtful comments.Just realized that there was a real question for this post  I am not a mom so I have no frame of reference.

6852290,0,t3_49i5gk,Over the past few years because of several people moving out of state some relationships just naturally fading and some having been purposefully ended for being unhealthy my social group has gotten a lot stronger but a lot smaller. This is almost completely a very positive thing except for the friends who moved who I miss but am happy for but lately its presented a problem. My th birthday is on Sunday and I feel like I should make slightly a bigger deal of it than I normally do on a birthday which is usually just going out for dinner and drinks with a few friends. I was thinking of renting a party room at my favorite barrestaurant but to do so would require such a high minimum fooddrink purchase that it would necessitate  people to come to make it even remotely worth it. And Ive kind of found myself very sad to realize that Im not sure I can lock down that many people. I mean I can start inviting randos from work who Im fond of but not particularly close to but that seems so obviously desperate that theyll notice and think its pathetic. But my wise bigsistertype at work told me that as you get older you get fewer and fewer chances to celebrate and if I dont take this opportunity to do something nice for myself to celebrate Ill regret it more than Ill miss the money. So now Im so torn between doing something celebratory that may end up being ridiculously and unnecessarily extravagant and perhaps not doing that and then always regretting I didnt take the chance to live it up.I already feel pretty strongly that Ive largely wasted my s not enjoying my youth and living it up despite the fact that I probably wouldnt have enjoyed being what I would consider more exciting due to my general laziness and also anxiety about danger or risk. Now I feel like Im going to spend more time on my birthday worried about the fact that no matter how I celebrate Im doing it wrong rather than just enjoying it.

So sometimes I did draw some more on my face but again only when I had some already I had red hair too to complete the lookAnd for those who says they ALWAYS look fake  nope it can be very natural if you choose the right color and place.

I ran out and I just cant justify rebuying it right now. I have a feeling  of the fancy ingredients arent doing anything for me and its mostly just the type of silicone but its hard to find conditioners that have it that kind but no other silicones.

Id love if you could buy larger or smaller sizes of singles no matter what you put them in because I know Id run through a good base color in  months where I probably wouldnt be able to use up a black eyeshadow in  years. And sometimes colors are palette only exclusives so if youre out of something you love youd need to find a dupe in a company that sells singles or youd need to go out and buy a whole new one and have all that other unused stuff there.

7355561,0,t3_4g3doc,I had a minor breakout last week Im very blackhead prone and usually stridex keeps it at bay but Id run out and was being stubborn about rebuying it because I couldnt find it on sale and Im on a tight budget. I ended up buying this generic wash off  salcylic acid gel mask thingy from Big Lots for like  cents I think it was called Salic and it just seemed like your basic salicylic gel face wash nothing fancy you leave it on for  minutes then wash it off.Maybe it was a fluke but it cleared up my skin so fast the next day all my raised zits were gone and my blackheads came out when I oil cleansed. Im just going to try it once a week in lieu of Stridex to see if it keeps my pores clear. My skin isnt really too troubled anymore so I was kind of questioning whether I even needed to use a bha product but after going without for a few weeks I can see it definitely contributes to keeping me clog free so Im going to continue with it once or twice a week.Also this is only vaguely skincare related but ever since I started using high linoleic safflower oil to remove my eye makeup a few months ago Ive grown another row of eyelashes. Id heard people say using certain oils on your lashes could give you fuller lashes but I always thought it was bullshit and thats not why I was using it but I dont know what its all about but I have totally grown way more lashes since using it so it might be worth a try if you want fuller lashes. I wouldnt expect miracles but lashes aside it is a nice oil for skin and is relatively inexpensive.

Dior Overcurl is soooo nice if I get it right but I doubt they sell a travel size version so Im going to use it up and forget it ever existed. And one day I wont have so many freakin primer samples sitting around. I have a few more of them unlisted but theyre all foils so x use each max.Im reeeeally unhappy with my concealers right now its the only category I just go ugh every time I think about it. One is super old and was kind of gross to use the Fair Neutral is decidedly too pink even under foundation and a bit too pale and the darker shade I havent tested yet on my summer skin. I really hope it works out. Ive basically stopped using concealer at this point because none of them work.I want to expand my lipstick collection a little bit in the cream department but definitely no more liquids.

7459438,0,t3_4hifnw,I dont know why but the one that bothers me the most is Jessica Braun. Her husband has a travel channel and she constantly says that part two of something shes doing is on his channel. She also says that she gives him shameless plugs. I get it. She loves him and thinks hes the best. And when content is relevant to his channel whatever. BUT. Her subscriber base is made up of women who like makeup as well as a lot of younger girls. Its odd to me to try and push traffic of that subscriber base to a travel channel just so her husband can get views. Shes said multiple times she would like for both of them to be fulltime youtube personalities but thats an odd way to go about it in my opinion. She had a video recently that had HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT in the videos title and then she said they had to check out her husbands channel to see the announcement. Thats just click bait and shitty I think. I like the majority of Jessicas content by the way. I dont watch her sponsored videos but I like her quite a bit. Thats just something that bugs me. As far as Tati I like James.

Its directly and solely a criticism of using that specific product on my specific skintone.If I say that NARS universal orgasm looks bright orange on my cheeks Im not saying that people with a skintone different than mine are orange.   Im saying that I saw Orgasm do beautiful things for other women and mistakenly assumed that whats beautiful on many people is beautiful on all people.

7508070,0,t3_4i6dj1,Coloring NCSkin Type OilyProblem areas Pores Flaky dry areas acne rednessProduct Primer that provided an easy base for most types of foundation particularly one that minimized pores and provided some coverage for the flaky dry areas and maybe could help minimize redness. ConclusionReview Smashbox HydratingSmashbox Pore Minimizing Combo so far... I love Smashbox Hydrating primer. It goes on so smoothly it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and plump it helps to prolong my foundation quite a bit. It is not as good at making my pores appear smaller but so far I havent found a primer that is capable of really doing this without drying me out. I like to layer just a little bit of Smashbox Photo Finish Pore Minimizing primer in my tzone. It works perfectly without drying that area out and helps a lot to keep the oiliness away. The Pore Minimizing primer is a lot like the Becca Pore Minimizing primer but less tacky and difficult to use.Path to the HG PrimerLaura Mercier Foundation Primer Water based and slippery which I initially did not like but have since come to appreciate as its much easier to apply. However this primer does not really create a smooth enough base. Pores still too huge flaky parts still flaky. The price point was fair at  per . oz of primer.Hourglass Mineral Veil A really luxurious siliconey primer that was excellent for wear time and controlling oil but left my skin feeling somewhat dry by the middle of day. Also its hard to be completely okay with the price.  oz of primer at  is just... meh.Smashbox Iconic Photo Finish Old reliable for me for sure. I really always have a travel or deluxe sample size of this laying around because it is really pretty good for an additional layer of smoothness especially in the tzone but it feels slimy all over my face.  for .oz isnt so bad. Smashbox Green Color Correcting Primer Ugh I really wanted this to work but it was just as slimy feeling as the Iconic Photo Finish all over my face but it also pilled into little pieces the original photo finish primer could do this if I was not smart with the foundationmoisturizer I used but it was rare pretty much every time I used it. And it offered zero redness coverage on me. MUFE Smoothing This was so pasty I didnt even attempt to buy the full size product and just used the deluxe sample twice or so. I wanted to like it. Ive since experimented with samples of MUFE Redness correcting and I did not like that either. I think MUFE primers are too thick feeling for me.Marc Jacobs Undercover Coconut Primer I liked the way this felt after it applied but it was a little too sticky to apply easily. It also was too oily for my skin type which I kind of figured might be the case but was hoping my usual method of applying a setting powder would be enough but not with this primer.YSL Touche Eclat Blur Perfector I wish this had worked as well as everyone claims that it does. I havent found the best way to really make it work for me. Its pricey but thats designer cosmetics for ya. I occasionally will go back and try and dab this into my tzone to see if it will suddenly be fantastic like Ive read but to no avail it feels like applying a wax to my face and it doesnt really make it look better.,muacjdiscussion,d2vmo5o,6,t5_342em

And all the beauty vloggers the popular ones were so distinct from each other. I dont even watch YT regularly now because its so unsettling to see a few archetypes that EVERYONE conforms to the bubbly blonde Caligirl the bubblybutsarcastic Altgirl the bubblyartistic Artistgirl and so little REAL variance in what they have to offer.And ironically the sad part is that while acting Stepfordversiony will initially work for the masses the conformity will lead to backlash and eventually to the decline in someones popularity.The stars in any world whether its beauty vlogging or something entirely different are the ones who have enough integrity to stick to whats authentically theirs and what they do differently from other people.

But I sure as fuck am going to follow a lot of their beauty tips because regardless of my opinions upon them theyre culturally known for being beautiful and thats undeniable.  And while there wouldnt be this same fervour over Kardashian Beauty or whatever it is their drugstore brand was Kylie Lip Kits is explicitly priced not at drugstore.  After all the not Colourpop hype and it originally not being Colourpop even people who dont give a fuck about Kylie past her image which half of is stolen from Blac Chyna and Heather Sanders like sis you going to MLA cite that? were buying into this is the best lip product forever hype.  While the lipkits were complicated as fuck and a bit of a reach I mean last I saw resells were  for  at the cheapest I could buy a ton of Melteds for that price people all over were hyping up the Lip Kits swearing up and down it was the best ever people werent making explicit dupes of the Lip Kits until quite a bit later....I think people me included thought the Kardashian name was a lot more of a guarantee than it was.

For example I got a set of  makeup geek blush pans for a discount and one is a bit too shimmery for my tastes so I use a fan brush to apply it to the tops of my cheekbones just slightly lower than where Id normally highlight.I definitely wouldnt buy an individual product specifically to use as a blush topper though haha. ,muacjdiscussion,d3evwhe,26,t5_342em

And then it sprays so much it doesnt dry down well and I have to dab it off with a beauty blender. I just hate this crap. It does make my makeup last a bit longer if it doesnt make it all patch off immediately on first spray but not even that much longer. Generally if I have a product that I dislike but that is functional I can use it up. But this... I just caved. I bought the Wet N Wild setting spray and already its so much better. Another product that really disappointed me was CoverGirls Clump Crusher. MUA loves that mascara so much and I just really disliked it.

7911305,0,t3_4nkg98, My brows are so sparse. Theyre also very dark. I didnt do anything with them except plucking until after I grew out my bangs and looked at photographs of myself. Then I went to Bloomingdales and got an eyebrow pencil at the Lancome counter Lancome was giving out free gift w purchase and I wanted my fave mlbb for free. The guy gave me a taupe pencil. I have since moved around and now I use ABH brow wiz in Ebony. Today Glossiers Boy Brow in black arrived in the mail and Im crazy excited.  is the terrible and very old photograph of myself that made me realize I need to do something with my brows  I draw my eyebrows semi natural. My face is hella asymmetrical and if I went for a more precise insta brow it would look insane. Ive never had my eyebrows professionally done though so Ive been thinking about hitting up a Benefit Brow Bar or even the ABH in Beverly Hills next time Im in LA just to see what a professional would do.  is how my eyebrows normally look. Sorry for the straight up selfiekinda messy brow technique its the only pic I had on hand showing my eyebrows.  I use tinted brow gel! I was using ABHs and just got Boy Brow. even though I have sparse brows they tend to get a little unruly so I like to keep them in place and I use tinted brow gel when Im wearing glasses filling in my brows looks a little harsh next to the dark frame of my glasses but having nothing on my brows looks a little strange when I have a full face on. I like it since what little hair I have is so dark it mostly just amplifies what Ive already got while still looking really natural. I used to not care about my eyebrows! Well Ive never let anyone else pluck them but other than that I was very low maintenance about my eyebrows. Im still pretty low maintenance and really only fill them in because I feel like it completes the look plus I get compliments on my fab brows when I do. nope. I did get made fun of in middle school for not waxing my brows though which is seriously LOL. Granted I was in middle school when super thin eyebrows were all the rage.

Its the liquid to powder finish one which I was unsure of given my dry skin but Im liking it so far. Its giving me the coverage I want but somehow still lets my freckles show through which is important to me. I dont feel like my face is plastic when I wear it. Im still working out the best primermoisturizer to apply first though. The biggest thing is I found I dont have as much time to work with it as I did my MUFE HD that Im kinda meh on for coverage. Like I normally did foundation brows cream contour then eyes and I would go back over my skin with powder contourhighlight etc. No go with the hourglass so Im getting in the habit of doing my eyes first which is brand new to me. I recently purchased the KVD shade and light eye contour palette and though I love the pigmentation it has more fallout than the Too FacedMAC shadows I was using before so doing eyes first is probably better anyways.

Makeup is hard to find here especially good makeup. I saw a Maybelline booth today at a store I frequent and it was packed because that is a BIG DEAL! All the makeup I have I bought overseas and that is only because I can afford.In the same vain if you see a woman wearing makeup especially good quality well blended makeup she most likely has the means to do so.

Skip the mediocre lipgloss let the cosmetic company pay their due in taxes that help propel the nations growth and donate straight to the charity of your choice without commercial intermediaries.Try Kiva.org and be instantly gratified for empowering micro entrepreneurs who try to make a difference.

8133788,0,t1_d4tlvgw,Im a bigger girl and Ive really enjoyed learning pole. I tend to solve problems by trying harder and for the most part you cant do that on a pole.  of the time the answer is that theres a technique or balance thing that hasnt clicked yet. The best advice I can give you is to be really really aggressive about putting your weight into it anytime a move involves pushing into the pole. The thing that gets you off the ground is that balance between push and pull and it takes more work to lift yourself by pulling than it is to just leanbrace extra hard. Im not sure how to handle the Woo Girl. I was in a class for a while with a girl who was  skinny had lots of previous pole experience and once staged a troupe coup that left me a chubby burlesque ronin. Its hard as fuck trying to learn frustrating things when youre also feeling distracted and angry at someone in the room. What helped was having a buddy in the class who was also struggling a bit with things or felt like she was. Sometimes you just need to bond with someone who isnt all sunshine and rainbows so you feel like their support is real.Sorry to jump all over your post.

8378730,0,t3_4u6irf,Full disclosure I dislike Jeffree despise his horrible behavior dont have any of his products and will not be getting any in the future. Boycotting his company if you so desire is a totally valid and good thing to do. What isnt a valid and good thing to do is assuming things about people who dont want to boycott him or who find errors in your argumentation.I see a lot of people saying that they were smart enough not to be violent or say any racist things when they were ish and so Jeffree should never be forgiven or excused. And so this isnt about Jeffree because there are strong reasons to suspect he is still every bit as racist andor racistforshockvalue as he was years ago. The fact he hasnt apologized properly is a strong argument for that. But people in this thread have raised concerns and asked the question  just because we were smart enough does it mean that there arent people with the capacity to be very very stupid and awful at one time and then become better? And the answer was mostly no its too awful and all these white people are out there excusing Jeffree smh so typical. But the white people argument is an identity argument. I could go around saying oh so all these straight women couldnt wait for the first opportunity to pile on a flamboyant gay man and that still wouldnt be good because it doesnt include the truth about what Jeffree has done. Someone whos white should be allowed to believe that people can change and include it in their consistent worldview and defend their opinion even though this time the person in question is horribly racist and theyve never had anyone be racist to them. And to round out my argument even though no one has talked about Jeffrees upbringing as a factor that might have influenced him being horrible and racistforshockvalue straight people should be allowed to believe that being horribly bullied doesnt excuse bad behavior even though the person in question is gay and their kind was the one doing the bullying. And how presumptuous is it of me and you to assume that this subreddit is frequented by straight white women only and that those identities come with built in opinions? As we can see being a liberal gay man hasnt stopped Jeffree from being horribly misogynistic and racist so whos to say it goes the other way around.Theres also the question of voting with your dollar and I see a lot of people saying that its hard not to buy fast fashion and that its hard to be vegetarian and stop supporting Nestle and find out which CEOs are racist and sexist but since Jeffrees racism has been thrown in our face and his product is a luxury product its easy to boycott him and youre lowkey racist if you dont? Im sorry but if I have the right to eat meat and buy Zara and watch a Roman Polanski movie someone else has the right to go to Dollskill and put a lipstick in their cart for whatever reason. When you try to apply your own moral compass to other peoples shopping carts that can get really ugly really quick. You might believe every act of shopping excuses the lifestyle decisions and prejudices of every CEO and you try to act accordingly even though it might be difficult or you think that line of thinking would lead to living in the forest cut off from civilization. Im somewhere in the middle like most of us but I cant decide whats worse Jeffrees disgusting white supremacist public behavior or the fact were all going to die in floods and heat waves because we havent boycotted enough planetdestroying companies. And I cant fault people who dont believe in voting with your dollar for this reason.,muacjdiscussion,d5ow1xt,2,t5_342em

Shed compliment how I looked when I looked good and would let me know if something was majorly fucked up like I missed blending my foundation in one part or my lipstick smeared. If she was looking for a specific product she would and still does ask me for input on what to buy like if she wanted a sheer moisturizing lipstick or a matte cream eyeshadow. The actual amount of makeup I wore wasnt something she was ever really worried by and I was wearing full faces daily by  but like many moms if something was too bold like purple or green lipstick red eyeshadow etc she would just be like ok.. if thats what you want and maybe suggest that I try something else lol. ,muacjdiscussion,d5p1mij,16,t5_342em

Applies with a BB knock off and set with translucent powder. Good at oil controlthe finish isnt as natural as Hourglass but for a fraction of the price and ease of use worth it. COLORS Tartes Rainforest of the Night Palette I got this palette to travel with as it had a blush contour highlight and eye colors in one plus a fantastically large mirror. But I was almost immediately disappointed because Tartes eyeshadows basically become on big brown blob on my eye. Seriously this palette has gold and purple in it but  times out of  I look like I just smeared cocoa powder on my eyes. BUT. Its the perfect sizeshapeconvenience for travel so I was determined to make it work. It was fussier to work with but careful application actually garnered some decent nonmuddy looks. I kept the purple shade as a pop of color on the lower lashline and dabbed the gold in the center of my lid with my finger and that actually worked pretty okay. And using the light brown as a base its close to my actual lid color helped with the blending.

You know where this is going...I compared them to MAC lipsticks Ive bought at Nordstrominperson and yo...theyre fake. I looked back at the sellers pictures there is no way of knowing that theyre fake pictures seem to use an authentic box maybe even an authentic model. I learned my lesson and just wanted to share my fuckup from years ago so you guys dont have to experience it. DONT BUY MAKEUP OFF EBAY. Theres a nonzero chance its a fake sellers know that if they sell too cheap youll know its too good to be true so they sell at a few bucks less than the full price but its still a fake. IDK where this is going but Im just ranting and if anyone has ever been curious about buying makeup on ebay I can tell you firsthand that at least for MAC lipsticks dont do it. It is such a popular lipstick brand to sell fakes of just spend the few extra dollars to buy online or go physically to try them on and find your perfect one.

8781884,0,t3_50aqq6,I bought Bite Multistick in Almond I posted a more thorough review of this in MUA Overall Im very impressed with this product. I love it most as a lip color but it has value as all  products for me. Im kind of disappointed that none of the other shades are really calling for me as much as I initially thought. Oh well! Better for my checking account. Korres Wild Rose Vitamin C Brightening Oil This isnt makeup but thats okay right? I have dry skin and some acne scarring. In the  weeks that Ive added this into my nightly routine Ive already noticed some noticeable fading along my jawline. I love the rose scent as well and its such a nice light silky oil. Modern Renaissance I hate buying into the hype. I did that when I first started really getting into makeup and now I regret it and prefer my own curated collection even if the items I use are not MUST HAVES. That said I only own  eyeshadow palettes including MR so I dont feel like I have an excessive amount. I really love warm mattes golden ochre is my favorite shade. I only have dupes for tempera and somewhatish for raw sienna. What I like is that none of the shades are duds in my opinion and I have used all of them so far unlike the black from the shade and light palette that I have never touched and disappointing glittery purple from the chocolate bar. I used up my sample of too faced Hangover Rx primer and went ahead and purchased the full size. Its very similar to the Marc Jacobs primer I know and love and its significantly cheaper so Im just going to alternate the two to extend their lives lol. I bought a Fit Me blush in light rose. I hate it. I hate it so much I hate buying drugstore only because I hate not being able to swatch before purchasing Im currently falling in love with my sample of MUFE water blend probably will pull the trigger on that sometime in September after that Im going to hold off on cosmetic purchases for myself aside from replacing any necessary empties for the rest of the year but Im not going to hold myself to that too strictly.,muacjdiscussion,d73end7,7,t5_342em

For the UK its much harder since they dont have Sephora  Kat Von D said in an interview recently that launching her brand in the UK took a very long time because of the contracts and finding a good distributor.

Its very shimmery and gives your skin a lot of slip. Id recommend it for dry skin.This months basketRevlon Photoready primer  I love this and think its better than my high end primers. I dislike the packaging as the product dries up inside the pump but thats not enough to make me not repurchase.MUFE Face and Body foundation  I like this foundation for unfussy looks when my skin is looking decent. It doesnt look like foundation at all just like my skin is a little nicer. I would repurchase this if it werent discontinued.Rimmel Match Perfection concealer  Ivory I dont like this concealer it blends away to nothing and doesnt cover my dark circles. Its old and Ive almost used it up. I wont repurchase.Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder  Dim Light I adore this powder its fantastic. It makes my skin glow. I will repurchase.Coastal Scents Blush Too palette this is a palette of ten blushes I bought when I was first getting into makeup. I put it in the basket and am hoping to use up one of the shades. I love these blushes they are so pigmented and the colour variety is excellent.Maybelline Colour Tattoo  Painted Purple I love the colour tattoo range but this one is crap. Its patchy doesnt blend and is quite sheer. Its an ok base for other shadows though so I hang onto it.Kat Von D Chrysalis palette this was my first palette purchase. I use the same shades every time. Transition is one of my favourite eyeshadows ever. I get bored pretty quickly when I use this every day but I do love it. I would repurchase if it werent discontinued.Savvy clear brow gel this is ok it was really cheap. I just use it to comb my brows in place when I dont feel like putting product in them. I wont repurchase.Kat Von D Tattoo Liner  Trooper this is the best liquid liner Ive ever used. So easy to use so black. Ive had it forever and it hasnt dried out even with regular use. Will repurchase.Covergirl Lashblast Volume  BlackBrown this is a basic everyday mascara not my favourite but not bad either.

I dont want to spend half my day in line at Canada place when we also want to hit Nordstrom Ted Baker Anthropologie JCrew etc. Plus our ferry is at   I dont know maybe the lines and wait time will subside by Sunday but maybe thats what everybody else is planning too?

8865999,0,t3_51kyag,Ive got lightmedium very yellow but also kinda olive warm toned skin about NC. Today I did something a little unusual with my makeup because I needed some more coverage!Primer NYX Angel Veil Ive used it less than  times because I only got it  weeks ago but I do like how it seems to smooth my face without being to siliconey. Concealer I spot concealed under my foundation today because its a great coverage concealer but its way too light for me. I used Maybelline Better Skin in Light to cover my dark circles acne and scars. The coverage is good and natural but if youre looking for a super good coverage concealer this isnt the one. Wont repurchaseFoundationTinted Moisturizer  Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer in Nude and  Lancome Teint Idole foundation in  Bisque W. These make a great combo and make my finish more light and natural. The LM gives light coverage and the Lancome gives medium buildable to full. Both colors are good for me. However Ill say that on my oily spots this combo fades after a few hours. Even alone the Lancome teint idole ultra h will NOT last even  hours on my oily spots. Instead of repurchasing the two im probably gonna buy a BB cream with a combo of these coverages and finishesPowder Rimmel Stay Matte in Transparent Decent. Not that great at mattifying. Probably wont repurchase.Blush a Sephora baked blush in a nice mauvey purple shade sorry blanking on the name! USE A LIGHT HAND WITH THIS! A ton of product comes onto the brush when you hardly even touch it. But its a nice natural finish.Brows Loreal brow gel in mediumdark I really like this! Holds my messy full intense brows in place all day bless those middle eastern genes ammiright Mascara Maybelline Full nSoft wow I really like this! I opened the tube a crack and left it for a few hours and now that the formula has dried out a bit more its so much easier to use! Its not clumpy doesnt flake for at least  hours looks natural. Its more for volume then length. I love the way it defines my eyelashes and kinda fans them out.Lips Combo of Revlon Balm stain in Honey and Laura Mercier lipgloss in Nectar. Ok first about the Revlon a recent purchase but I love it so far! It applies looking like a balm. The color is a little purpley on my skin tone in flattering way. It wears for a pretty decent amount of time and I dont bother reapplying. Ok now Laura Mercier gloss in Nectar PERFECT COLOR FOR ME!!!!! The orangeypinky coral color complements my skin tone really well! I can wear it over any natural even somewhat MLBB or nude lip color. I can also wear it on its own although it looks a bit light for my skin tone when I do that. The formula is a bit sticky for me and the price is expensive  so Im probably gonna replace it with a similar shade in the ABH glosses. ,muacjdiscussion,d7dkhct,3,t5_342em

Its different than in the US though since its incredibly cheap. They treat it like getting a facial instead of getting stuff done. But I dont even get facials since theyre out of my budget and I dont  feel like Im missing much.I dont expect to feel any qualms about aging since my mom has aged fantastically and I look forward to following down her path. Im also quasi looking forward to grey hair so I can dye it more easily! right now its black and maintaining any sort of color other than brownpurple is a huge PITABut back to my mom even though I think she looks youthful she complains about her age spots and wrinkles. She started wearing makeup to cover them up. Its a shame since I dont think they detract from her look and I know she doesnt enjoy the process of makeup. Another thing she believes is the older you are the bigger your jewelry should be. She wears big cocktail rings on the daily.

Right now Im using this stuff from Sephora  but I think the MAC wash is the best Ive used. I just spray some on the brush wipe it on a piece of toilet paper then when Im done I dampen the toilet paper and wipe the brushes again to get the cleanser off. It only takes a minute and the brushes dont get totally wet so they dry quickly and are ready to be used again in the morning. Its not as thorough a cleaning as using soap and water but it keeps the brush usable for the week. I use the Sephora  brush for foundation too and I really like it but tbh I wouldnt want to use it without doing a light cleansing every day.

I definitely cannot use this in the eye area without that effect but on the cheeks its lovely. Im not  sure how it will play with your skintone. I am hesitantly going to say it will work the peach is not deep enough to read as orange on you IMO and the pink might be gentle enough to not be abrasive. UGH dense hair unite. My dad used to call my moms hair horse hair because its literally that texture. And I inherited that from her. Thats partly why I keep it short when its long it refuses to cooperate in any sort of societallyacceptable way  The Kiss Me Heroine Make Long amp Curl definitely holds my lashes in a curl better than any other mascara Ive tried highend or drugstore.

So now I dont apply any dark liner to my waterline. Sometimes I will use a light coat of mascara to define my lower lashes but that is it. But I always try again every couple of months thinking I can make it work lol,muacjdiscussion,d7zpdjn,5,t5_342em

9450330,0,t1_d9dutxv,Yep. I think over consumption is basically another term for participating in a capitalist economy and its by no means exclusive to the beauty community. This may be more of an issue in the US than other parts of the world not simply because there are relaxed return policies lower prices better rewards programs more advertising campaigns etc. but because all of those things are geared towards getting people to buy in a competitive market so that businesses can make money. The US is a bigger market than for example Australia or NZ so its consumers will receive more purchasing incentives because both the competition and the financial rewards are higher. In the next decade or so I would expect the opening up of China to more and more Western beauty companiesproducts will create a similar effect because the US market pales in comparison to the Chinese market more people  more purchasing power.

No. But we all notice things whether its strangeness in application or styles we likedont prefer. As long as we dont treat people poorly or make them feel bad and its not taking up so much of our thoughts that it becomes a personal problem I dont think its inherently a bad thing.

9577221,0,t3_5c3n1j,I blame Sephora and Ulta for initiating large campaigns that they werent prepared for. Recent upgrades to the Ulta app means that it doesnt work on older phones Ulta refuses to put more money into expanding the customer service department that would be required if the app were compatible with more peoples phones. Their website still isnt userfriendly. Sephoras app really should have a better product locator system if its going to have one at all and theres no excuse for corporate not telling staffers what the Play point cards are for.Both companies went along with huge LE palette launches even though they knew that their websites and stores couldnt handle the traffic. Sephora definitely has the power to tell brands that they need to stop with these crazy launches that arent staggered far enough apart.I would NEVER EVER blame an individual staffer for any of this but there are times when Ive said I know this isnt your fault but from the perspective of customer service feedback heres whats going on with the app or heres a tidbit I read about online that might make this whole whatever less confusing. Theyre usually glad to know why the Ulta app isnt working or that the Sephora app is continually sending people to stores for products that arent there.,muacjdiscussion,d9tl69x,39,t5_342em

Like the Drake one you cant look at that color and not picture Rihanna wearing it. Or Anderson being a cute pink like the pink triangle that symbolizes the gay movement. I see it as an injoke as to Anderson Coopers sexual orientation. Thats the kind of meaningwit Im thinking of. Or it could be like that NARS collection that had shades named after classic actresses. You could see that the person named would wear that shade. That kind of a connection between name and shade. After all dont we enjoy names in any line that relate to the shade? When you hear Cherries in Winter you know what you are getting.  Instead on his website its a huge collection of  shades and it seemed like the names were chosen out of a list of popular names for twentysomething men. It didnt feel personal to TF or authentic to his brand. And there wasnt an obvious connection between most names and colors  like Hunter or Forrest being green for a super simple example. It seemed poorly done in that way as well. So it made me feel that it was just a crass money grab without the style Id expect from TF.

So I decided to try this out instead of going with my usual foundation Revlon ColorstayI have oily fair neutral skin and got the shade   is darker for some reason. I am enjoying it thus far. Its incredibly high coverage with a satin finish. I use a setting powder so its more of a matte finish on me. Its long wearing I can get  hours of solid wear out of it. I would recommend this to people as a concealer for small spots or foundation if someone has problem skin like I do. The best thing about it imo is that its full coverage without feeling heavy and looking heavy. All bronzerblushect blends beautifully on it and as an added bonus I use way less undereye concealer as it does help with that it can crease pretty easily though if you are prone to that. ,muacjdiscussion,daxtsds,14,t5_342em

He makes jokes about how I have a target on my chest and he wants to throw something at it. Not a beanbag because thatd hurt but like a cotton ball or something. I was creeped out but I just told him uh no dont do that kthx a few times and then I went back to my host stand. Later he walks by to go out and smoke and makes more comments including something about a velcro dart or whatever. I tell him in my polite service industry voice to stop it and that if he throws something at my chest I will throw him through something. He laughs it off and walks away. I grit my teeth and keep going because fucking whatever creeps suck but hes hopefully gone. I mention it to one of my managers manager says to get him if the dude throws anything at me and to warn him that Ill get management if he says more creepy shit. Im like cool whatever back to work.THEN. LIKE. TWO HOURS LATER. Im talking to one of my coworkers and hes apparently still at the fucking bar because hes suddenly ten feet from me and miming dartthrowing. At my chest. I looked at him and told him he needed to stop before I got management and he didnt. He kept acting like it was a joke. So I went to find a manager and manager from earlier goes over and talks to the guy and escorts him out.Im glad its done and hopefully it never happens again but Im just so fucking angry. Who the fuck does that??? Especially considering I told him a LOT that it wasnt funny dont do that I do not appreciate the idea of someone throwing things at me! Fuck. That. I was about to punch him.

9995484,0,t3_5ir7n6,Theoretically this might be a decent deal but Im not sure that people are going to buy in.Lots of people dont like to spend money just to spend more money. It works for Costco and Sams Club but youre always going to need more instant coffee and rice theres only so much makeup you can try from a single brand and lipsticks are harder to finish off than food. The idea of a month makeup membership that doesnt actually give you anything for that first  is going to put some people off.Another thing thatll put people off  flat rate shipping. People hate paying for shipping. People hate paying for shipping so much that theyll often spend more than intended just to hit a free shipping threshold. I admit to being one of those people from time to time. Beauty Pie has committed to selling products at factory prices so any sort of free shipping would cut significantly into their month profit. From that perspective I get why they wont do itbut that doesnt rule out charging month upfront for a membership that includes free shipping. I dont know. Maybe people would balk at paying month even more than they balk at  flat rate shipping for orders that total  tops. Maybe month works better because its already been accepted as a standard price for Fun Makeup Stuff.Personally I wish theyd developed a more extensive foundation shade range and Id be more likely to subscribe if their color cosmetics came in more interesting colors. Their blushes all look the same. And only offering one bronzer seems like a glaring mistake. Hopefully its corrected as more products are rolled out next year.,muacjdiscussion,dbafu67,39,t5_342em

One of my coworkers dresses like this. Make up doesnt need to be about flattering yourself it can be about wearing colors that you love even if they dont suit the skin you were born with. It makes me really love the sub ratbge but I havent seen much make up there  although I suppose thats a good thing. This trumps everything Im going to post below but I do still have personal preferences for make up.I love intentionally unnatural looks  and I dont mean things like bright lips and eyes I mean things like bizarre blush colors and alternative eyebrows where theyve been drawn on in a thorny cursive style similar to tattoo swirls. Obviously the execution needs to be top notch though.Some people and looks suit dark eyeliner on the waterline.  techniqueproduct did not change my life. Unless one of those things burns my face off permanently it never ever will.Highlight tends to look like sweatoil especially when applied to the nose.This probably isnt a popular opinion but Ive never seen anyone else mention it  nose contours that join with your eyebrows look a bit off to me. ,muacjdiscussion,dbblo94,143,t5_342em

I like to use any powder that works well for me I dont really see a difference between the forms but that may be because I honestly havent tried that many.    Do you use both a setting and a finishing powder or just one? I just use a finishing powder Hourglass ALP.

I like the Besame loose powders to brighten up my undereye. They work REALLY well!    Which products and tools do you use? One fancy days I might use a damp beauty blender but daytoday I just reach for whatever brush is closest.    Whats your skin type? Normal.    Were there any mistakes you had to make before getting it right? Nope. I mean there better not be with the  big ones I put down for the Hourglass ALP.    Did any particular tutorials help you?

Shout out to the Houston Galleria the Los Angeles Grove and the th Avenue store in Manhattan associates because I never know what Im looking for but I know what I like and what I dont like. They always give me more samples than I can use and dont mind spending an extraordinary amount of time with me when I probably wont buy anything.Also special shout out to the Times Square Sephora because the associates are or were I havent been in years always polite and managed to look put together in that insanity. Having worked in retail it sucks when people think that youre giving them poor service when they wont come up and speak to you. They expect you to hear their blinking eyelids or thousand yard stares.

10384650,0,t3_5on3s8,I think lipstick dupes are generally effective and I appreciate the option to buy a particular color in a different formula  especially in a more comfortable formula  or at a lower price point if I know its not something Ill reach for often. There are staple shades that basically every lip product line has and its nice to be able to pick a lip product based on its other attributes finish longevity comfort etc rather than just gunning for the shade and sacrificing those other preferences.BUT my undertones are extremely cool so sometimes a shade thats a dupe on people with more neutral or warmleaning skin will have a tiny tiny shade difference that makes it into a completely different color on my face. So that can be frustrating.

I find they work best over eyeshadow and primer rather than solo. I have hooded eyes and typically dont notice transfer but if Im only wearing eyeliner then it will fade after a couple hours. Rockstar used to be my goto everyday color but Ive used it up and moved on to Whiskey. I think I would repurchase Rockstar but I want to use up my other purple eyeliner first. I tend to wear brown or grey on a daily basis and rarely wear black. I usually do simple eyeliner to compliment eyeshadow though recently Ive been doing very minimal eyeliner or just tightlining. My favorite way to tightline is with eyeshadow and I use a Smith Cosmetics tightlining brush which I can also use for delicate liner right along the lashline. When I want to do winged liner I use a KVD Tattoo Liner sample. I find winged liner too difficult to look nice if Im using anything but liquid liner but I have a good friend who only uses pencil liner for her wings and they always look crisp. ,muacjdiscussion,dcsn4ph,4,t5_342em

I sometimes see it on gurus too but no shade do what you want obviously.It works both ways too of course. Nikkietutorials foundation doesnt look like a match initially because of the red in her face but compared to her body its the right colour.I guess what I was saying is its hard to match full coverage because differences in undertone can be glaring.

These women are truly awful racist and misogynistic this seems like a beauty sub for women who dont really enjoy beauty. I read through the post about their routines and it seemed like most of them didnt know or care much about products or techniques more so just seeming like they dont use much because apparently thats off putting to men lol. If you compare that to the average routine thread here theres a discussion of techniques and the shade longevity and quality of the products we use. Its the difference between the vague I use a MAC blush currently which is entirely useless in a beauty discussion and I apply MACs Gingerly blush to the cheekbones and along the temples with a Zoeva angled blush brush its peachy but has enough brown to sculpt and warm up the face or something like that.It seems like the excitement about makeup goes away when youre only wearing it to please men.,muacjdiscussion,dd9s5dv,57,t5_342em

10727659,0,t1_ddma9jr,Hahaha no problem! Ive been baffled by plenty of products too. So basically yes I usually applied it after all my face makeup foundation blush highlight bronzer but mainly focused on the sides of my cheeks and center of the forehead which is where I have huge craterlike pores and where I usually get oily. I used to be combo to normal skin until I moved to a colder climate so now in the winter I see  what dry skin feels like. Unfortunately I have not used the product on my now dry skin type. I never felt that the face defender moved or interfered with the wear time for my blush or anything like that. The difference that it made for me was to mattify and softly blur pores right after doing my makeup and then when I felt I got oily during the day it would mattify again without having to add powder I hate that combo of oil on my skin and powder on top BLECH!.About the setting spray I dont use it very often and Im pretty sure I never combined both products so I really cant say. However I think that they could go well together especially if its a more matte finish spray as opposed to a very dewy one but I really dont know. As to why I never put it directly on my nose this is more something weird Ive noticed about myself but I dont know if it happens to a lot of people...no matter which product I put on top of it moisturizer primer concealer my nose starts to sweat   like huge drops of sweat start surfacing from beneath. If I put nothing on it not a drop. I have no idea why. I have also used it on its own without any other face makeup and I think it held up wellexcept when I added too much product then I got oily fast.

The Ulta brand highlighters are surprisingly good as well.Got any tips or tricks to make product application easier?Only apply highlight where the light would actually hit your face and go in with a light hand then build up intensity from there.Were there any mistakes you had to make before getting it right?Probably just finding the right shades to suit my skintone.

10985830,0,t3_5wvfz1,Heres my face today.  Maybelline MasterPrime in BlurIlluminateI like this primer as much as I like the Becca Backlight Priming Filter and although theyre both glowy primers and the Maybelline works just as well as the Becca for me theyre different tones so I wouldnt call the Maybelline a dupe for the Becca. The Maybelline is decidedly pink where the Becca is more of a neutral champagne. The Maybelline is also scented which doesnt bother me in the slightest but if youre sensitive to smells keep that in mind.  UD Primer PotionI dont think anyone needs a review of this. It works but only as well as not better than Milanis eye primer so when I finish this tube Ill probably just stick to the Milani because money.  Kat Von D InnerstellarI griped a couple months ago about not being able to make anything work with this damn thing and thats still largely true. I used it today for that pretty almost duochromey pinky purpley light shade. Im not gonna get rid of the palette and I have liked it more recently but its just really not the greatest.  LOreal Pro Glow in  Creamy NaturalIve been on a powder foundation kick lately but Ive also been watching RawBeautyKristi on YouTube and she uses this foundation all the time and it made me want to pull mine back out. Im glad I did. Ive really been loving it. The coverage is light to medium but it can be built up. It doesnt ever go cakey on me blends beautifully and the color match is good on me. I think? If you can see a problem with my foundation match please tell me. Im never sure.  Becca Undereye CorrectorI got this in a set with a mini poured highlight a blush and the Backlight Priming Filter. I assumed I wouldnt use it much but I actually use it every day. The finish is a bit shiny but I set my under eye with powder and you cant tell after powder. It does what its supposed to do without mucking up my concealer. I use the crap out of it and will repurchase when Im out.  Tarte Shape Tape in LightI finally figured out that this stuff dries quickly enough that I need to do one under eye at a time. That works well for me though. I didnt really like this stuff until I got my dry skin more to the normal side. But now I can use it without issue. As long as I take my time blending and set with powder it doesnt crease up on me and lasts all day.  NARS blush in Singood lord I love this stuff. Im a big fan of shimmery blushes and purpley blushes so this is riiiiiiiight up my alley.  Dior Nude AirSkin Whatever The Fuck highlight in the pink shadeDude. Dior and the long goddamned names. Anyway I just picked this up a couple of weeks ago and full disclosure I bought it based on packaging alone. The compact is just so gorgeous. But its also a really nice highlight! Its subtler than a Becca highlight for example and doesnt have any glitter like my MAC Trip the Light powder from the Star Trek collection. I tend to go on heavy with it because I cant control myself with highlight. If you like a subtle highlight this with a fan brush would be your jam. Is it drastically different than other more inexpensive highlights? Probably not. The same effect can certainly be accomplished for much less money. But like I said Im a packaging whore and I like luxury makeup.  Chanel Rouge Coco Glossin shade . Really pretty sparkly gloss non sticky fairly long lasting and hydrating but same situation as the Dior the effect can absolutely be replicated at a lower pricepoint.  Covergirl LashBlast VolumeHG mascara for real. I love the living shit out of this mascara and I have not been able to find one that performs like this one does. I get length and volume and it holds a curl all day. Basically it makes me look like I have way better lashes than I actually have which is exactly what mascara is supposed to do. Seriously cannot say enough good things about this mascara.  edit forgot the product Im most enthusiastic about. Mascara. ,muacjdiscussion,ded7j6x,9,t5_342em

11018722,0,t3_5xbgss,Ive tried a variety of cheaper sponges than my BB and found some that gave me the exact same finish  however they tore apart easily. If I was looking at the cost per year to achieve the finish the BB gave me then my official BB was actually cheaper because it was more durable. I never found another sponge that was as soft as my BB. I was actually really disappointed my RT and gave it away after a couple of tries because it was so dense and hard to blend. My arm actually got sore from having to hold it for so long. I do wish my BB had the RT flat side though. However I just threw my BB out last week and I have no plans to replace it for the eight months or so. Im working my way through my foundation collection and Ive found that most of mine Maybelline look way better when warmed and applied with fingers. My previous foundations Revlon Rimmel Elizabeth Arden looked better when applied with my BB. ,muacjdiscussion,degxwla,2,t5_342em

11030723,0,t1_dei7o9x,Yes or at least most of the time depending on what kind of look Im going for. If I want to do something really simple with just one shadow Ill pat on a bit of glitter glue on top of bare lids or skin toned eyeshadow then pat the shadow on top. It doesnt really work to blend over top of glitter glue so Ill usually blend out everything first then glitter glue then duochrome or sparkly eyeshadow. I usually use my fingers it just works better for those kind of shadows...applying with a fluffy brush or windshieldwiper type motions doesnt really work you wont get that color shift. You could also dampen a flat eye brush with water or some type of setting spray and pat on with that. ,muacjdiscussion,deib2oq,3,t5_342em

11051951,0,t3_5xtbw8,Ive tried every product from them. Makeup is excellent if you like minimal looks and their skincare products are probably best for normal skin.Makeup My Cloud Paint is en route and should be in when I get home from work. Ive noticed that their shipping has gotten a little bit slower as their popularity grows. But its still pretty fast and their customer service is amazing. Boy Brow is my HG brow product. I keep my brows big and natural so all I need is something to gently hold them in place and compensate for the few patches that repopulate after the s Sperm Brow Epidemic. But the tube is obnoxiously tiny and I usually have to restock every  months. Skin Tint and concealer give very very light coverage and a glowy finish. YMMV on whether this is absolutely amazing or pointless and terrible. Haloscopes dont give me tons of glitter but they do give me lots of gloss. I like using Topaz as some sort of strange bronzerblushhighlighter combo as it looks the most natural and nicest for my skin tone. Their lipsticks are very sheer on me except Jam and Zip. Leo is probably my favorite.Skincare Serums are nice but they dont list the percentages on the actives so who knows if theyre worth it? A shame because the Vitamin C formulation in Super Glow seemed really interesting and didnt feel awkward on my skin like many do. The Ordinary is said to have similar minimalist serums but with more details. I can also vouch for them. I have greasy skin and their moisturizer is decent. But it does include shea butter and honeysuckle which can aggravate a lot of folks skin. Their face cream is surprisingly not super greasy on me. Its very thick though so I prefer to use it at night and only on my notoriously dry places during the day. The lavender in it doesnt bother me. Cleanser is great. Its pH balanced and nice for a gentle cleanse. I love it in the morning for massaging off the sleepgunk on my face without scrubbing. If you wear a lot of makeup youre still going to want to remove it beforehand as it doesnt cut through everything. Ill also swap it sometimes for a gel cleanser in the evening if Im feeling extra greasy. Balm Dotcom contains lanolin which I can be sensitive too so Im not using it right now. A shame because I love the scent of the rose one. Soothing Face Mist ironically stings my eyes if I dont squeeze them tight when spraying. Apparently its probably the honeysuckle? Mega Greens Face Mask has a million dupes and DIY alternatives. Nothing special. Moon Mask is nice as an overnight mask.,muacjdiscussion,dekpwx4,48,t5_342em

I didnt need to go drape myself in a department store for that. I double checked it by pasting my face over various season palettes I fit in best with Soft Summer which is what the quiz suggested.I spent a couple moments to turn some of those long rectangular palettes on google images into something easier to compare to a face. Here they are i recommend taking the test and then checking the results against nearby seasons with a well lit cutout of your face it might provide a starting place for more diy draping stuff. Or you might just be like me shrug and say that explains why chartreuse eyeliner looks natural on me and not make any investigative excursions for this reason.

Bluetoned red reads older than warmtoned red. I think its mostly due to my moms influence. She never wore reds but loved lilacs frosty cooltoned pinks and browns she wore the most makeup in the s and early s. Red always makes me feel like Im underdressed and should probably style my hair or something.  Bright lilacs pinks and corals read as girly and ethereal to me.

Its one thing to do art I consider photography  to be an art form for the purpose of raising women objectification awareness and its another thing to do it for marketing. The thing is its strongly framed in such a way that the first thing you look is her genitalia and it takes you a while to look at anything else which screams problematic to me for marketing purposes.

I remember their previous palette in this packaging having questionable quality but Temptalia says this is an improvement on their recent palette formulations.I cant see it being too popular with the rmua crowd because  anyone who has at least one UD palette probably has these exact shades or close dupes and  the pans are tiny. If this were your main palette for an extended period of time youd burn through the top row in no time.  Each shadow is .oz. For reference Modern Renaissances pans are .oz and people are burning through their most used shades in that palette in a matter of months.

Almost a little too much for my taste but my skin looks amazing in less intense lighting aka fluorescent office lighting. Does a decent job with my pores and covering up my redness. Not so great with hyperpigmentation marks. So far so good. Evens out skintone with minimum application so it feels really lightweight.NARS SinCasino Duo Rediscovering this with a more critical eye. Sin comes off more rosy pink on my skin and I like the natural flush it gives. Casino has terrible pigmentation but warms up my skin without looking ruddy.Prestige Cosmetics Gentle Finish Mineral Powder Foundation in  A little too dark.

I did have a slightly tinted lip balm underneath Cover Girl Oh Sugar! In Candy which might help with the color but I didnt have to go over my lips several times.

Its not about duping things which is fine and obviously popular but its about taking the whole idea and disrespecting creative process behind it. Its a bit like with Zara using work of indenpendent artists. Its not always an EXACT copy but its so close that you know where it came from and you know that for sure. It just rubs me the wrong way I am definitely cheap when it comes to some things and Kat Von D products ARE up there in price but to me it doesnt justify stealing the design the idea and calling it a day.She has every right to be petty although I agree she went in too hard.

11355032,0,t1_dfil1yi,Agreed. Plus the foundation settles in the cracks of my fingers under my fingernails ends up getting on my steering wheel on the keys of my keyboard. Applying with a tool is the way to go especially for a dense long wearing formula. ,muacjdiscussion,dfj2lk5,5,t5_342em

11365690,0,t3_6260ow,This is my first FOTD review so I hope I am doing this right. I have normaltodry NC skin with no major problems except for mild hormonal acne on the chin and consequently some hyperpigmentation.Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz  Ebony This is my first and so far only brow product. Ive been using it since October  to fill in the sparse patches in my eyebrows and to add more definition. I am really enjoying it so far the pencil has great accuracy good but not overthetop pigmentation and glides easily across the skin. I like the convenience of the dual ends. It lasts the whole day on me. I see no reason to not repurchase this save for my curiosity about similar products in the market and how they would perform in comparison.Guerlain Meteorites Baby Glow   Clair DESCRIPTION  Described as sheer it is a lighttomedium coverage foundation on me covering most but not all of my scars and slightly lightening my undereye circles. It appears to have a satin finish on my normaltodry skin. The shade Clair is a touch too light and a smidgen too pink on me. It has a violet fragrance that disappears soon after application.CONS  The price around JPY  is horrifying for what is technically a BB cream. The name Baby Glow is atrocious. The shade range however is the most shocking thing about it it has a grand total of  shades and all of them have peachy undertones supposedly to brighten the complexion.PROS  This is an excellent choice for beginners with money to burn andor people who need a pickmeup on the quick it applies well with fingers is buildable and is very easy to blend. When used in conjunction with Les Voilettes it lasts more than  hours. My nose gets a smidgen shiny after  hours of wear. The part under my glasses breaks down faster than the rest of my face but it does so relatively gracefully without leaving nasty foundation streaks behind. My favourite thing about it is the finish it rids the skin of any hint of sallowness evens out the skin tone and imparts a luminosity while still allowing the flush on my cheeks to peek through. The effect is really apparent without resorting to heavy coverage.I would probably be on the lookout for something with a similar effect but with a lower price tag. If I dont manage to find a replacement by the time I finish my tube I will be resigned to purchasing Baby Glow again.Guerlain Les Voilettes   MediumDESCRIPTION  The SA recommended this to me as a setting powder for extending the longevity of my foundation and for touchups during the day. The powder is translucent. It gives a velvety but glowy finish.CONS  Again the price. It is also heavily perfumed and the fragrance doesnt dissipate for some time. I really like fragrance but Les Voilettes is simply too much  it has completely desensitized me to violets  which is why I am putting this as a con.PROS   Goodbye pores! Goodbye shine! Also although it has little coverage I find that it blurs out my hyperpigmentation. It sits beautifully on the skin and lasts about  hours on top of my foundation. I also find that it helps my foundation to withstand the assault from my glasses sitting on the bridge of my nose by a significant amount.Les Voilettes has outperformed all other setting powders I have had the luck and bad luck of trying by a large mile. It is simply so effective that it is almost magical. I am open to buying a cheaper alternative but if nothing pops out I will repurchase this without any complaint  it is just that good.,muacjdiscussion,dfka294,6,t5_342em

I live in Egypt and imported cosmetics here are either drugstore or luxury brands at huge markups and even then we dont get all the products from each brand.Bourjois Volume pushup mascara in Wonder Black I really like this minimal clumping right away rather than having to let the formula dry out a bit over a week or so good separation doesnt smudge. Also the smell is pleasant and not overpowering. I still prefer Great Lash but thats not available where I live.Bobbi Brown Mini Eye amp Lip Palette I couldnt believe I found this. This is the  iteration with neutral eyeshadows and lip colours as well as a lip gloss in Bare Sparkle. I know its kinda risky using something thats been stored for so long but everything smells and looks fine. This is going to be my Im a grownup I swear palette for use when I travel for conferences. I got it for about  and it was new and untouched.Bourjois little round pot blush in Cendre de rose brune I love this. I wasnt expecting much but colour me impressed! The colour is lovelya muted neutral rose its very pigmented and the texture is so soft. I love it. This is going to be my defaultwinter blush as I already have NARS Orgasm for summer.Maybelline Baby Skin Meh. Doesnt do much for my pores. It does help smooth skin for foundation but I wear foundation maybe twice a year. Also I hate the name. Planning to replace with The Porefessional on my next trip abroad.e.l.f brow comb and brush Nothing special but I will say Im glad I picked this one for its longer tines on the comb makes combing out mascara clumps much easier.Bdellium Tools concealer brush S Best concealer brush Ive used.

11456670,0,t3_63duoh,Ive been manager at my store for a month and boy is it a learning curve. I had someone transfer to another store so I had to hire someone new. Friday someone else turned in their notice because she got a better job except she keeps talking to everyone everywhere about how she isnt sure she wants to leave and shes unhappy with how things have been handled and she wants to move up but Im not doing enough for her. On my todo list the day she turned in her notice was to work with her on her development plan. People can bring pets to work. One girl has a young dog who has recently started resource guarding. No bueno. I have a background in dog training and Im pretty good at reading dogs and while I see her behavior it isnt so bad that it makes me uncomfortable. But shes making other people uncomfortable. And shes bitten two people. I saw that in that way because she doesnt leave scratches bruises and certainly not punctures but these two coworkers have zero threshold for dog mouth on person. But also dont pet her if she has a bone? And its been so badthe fearfor one girl that she has avoided tasks if the dog is nearby. But this didnt all come out to me until it was already at bitten. Because no one wants to hurt anyones feelings or confront anyone. So now I have to tell this girlwho is fantastic and doing a lot of training and work with her stubborn dog right nowthat she cant bring her dog to work anymore because the rule is  bite  gone. And I get it. I absolutely get it. People cant be uncomfortable at work. People cant be at risk. But omg if you had come to me earlier about this issue as it unfolded I could have put rules into place to prevent it all. Gaaaaahhhhhhhh. Im also trying to redo many things about the way things are done because it turns out things have just been running amok here for awhile.

So now I put blush in the contour area sometimes being careful to follow the guidelines. Right inside the cheek hollow but leaving white space on the sides of the face on the jawline and upper cheekbones and a bit of horizontal blending to kind of cut the face in half. I always make sure to make the corners of my jaw brighter to widen it.Today I used a sheer pink highlighting blush in the hollows of my cheeks which I think looked great because it has some light color while in the shadow but disappears when hit by light and it kind of helped look more natural instead of painted and hide the hollowness.

Foundation Revlon Colorstay and Frankie Rose Matte Perfection are the only foundations that dont slide off my face. Frankie Rose is sold online and at some boutique retailers. I got into it because this beauty boutique I go to uses it for bridal makeup since it photographs well and stays on. . Concealer Ulta Full Coverage concealer is a hidden gem. Stays on for a long time when set. . Eyeliner KVD Tattoo Liner Stila Stay All Day and Revlon Colorstay Skinny are the ones that last forever. . Cant live without Urban Decays Primer Potion.

Drunk Elephant Rise  Glow set  Really want to try their Vitamin C serum but dont want to commit to a full size of any skincare right now.On the fence Biossance Squalane Cleansing Oil  Im almost done with my Fancl oil so I do need a replacement...I could just get another DHC and be done with it and this just gets washed off so its not too important but the squalane intrigues me. On the other hand I read on Sephora that its formula is on the thin side which Im not into. IDK Clinique Fig Pop  I have this in my cart right now so Im leaning towards buying it but again I dont neeeeed it. I might go swatch again and see how I feel first.Not gonna buy Viseart Palette Petit Pro  I dont need any more eyeshadow especially when all I do on the daily is a wash of color on the lid  liner.

But that desire to own one was still there burning in the back of my head like a powerful itch. Stay strong to MUR I said. I have a powder blush I like just fine I said. I can just use lipstick I said. No. I could not. I did not. I bought it.And holy shit yall if you like cream blushes get yourself a sample of any of their fabulous colors. And even if you dont like cream blushes you just might be a convert.Oh but agentsmudge! I have oily skin! You might say. Well thats where youre wrong. My skin is incredibly oily but guess what? This. Shit. STAYS! Tap a little powder blush on top and my blush will last even when my face looks like I slathered it in vaseline. Also lets talk about the scent. The shade Watermelon smells like honest to God watermelon! Its amazing! Raspberry smells like actually raspberries and not shitty cough syrup raspberry either.

11620791,0,t3_65qr8r,I really appreciate customer comments on social media. I think that its actually much MUCH better to deal with customers on social media than on the ground because on the ground they tend to be very angry. Id rather deal with their passive aggression. Its also good from a customers standpoint because companies are forced to address your claims because they are there on the Internet for everyone to see. Furthermore commenting on social media also means youre going higher up the chain. Where the store manager may be tied to some restrictions commenting on social media means youve reached the corporate level. They are more likely to help you out and be able to help you out because theyre not worried about losing their jobs. I do find it concerning for the companies that people post complaints in hopes of obtaining free products. No. Thats not how its meant to be done. It makes me lose faith in humanity when people use it as a ploy to get free stuff. I definitely respect a company more for using unique responses because calling any company honestly sucks.

11804671,0,t3_68ccbi,I find that if I bring cooler colors blacks blues purples up above my crease I look scary and dead. If its a warmer color like a pink orange or red I can get away with it. If I want to use a cool color on my lid I definitely need a warm transition color in and just above my crease. I have hooded eyes and not a ton of lid space so itd be nice to be able to do more blown out looks with cool colors but I havent found a way yet. ,muacjdiscussion,dgy3mf6,1,t5_342em
11805277,0,t1_dgy5fkq,Purges depend on the person really. If you had a lot of stuff in your pores then they could be deep and it would be painful. Of course it could also be breaking you out too. Its really hard to tell the difference. The only sure fire way Ive seen is continued use. If your skin does stop breaking out and gets better then it was purging. If it doesnt and its continual for a period of time then its the product. ,muacjdiscussion,dgy63cl,5,t5_342em

11808017,0,t1_dgygvqg,Exactly. Like why would you design a line where everything looks so similar? To confuse us? Do I have GimmeGoofKaBROW already? I cant tell since the shine of this silver plating is giving me a headache. Guess Ill buy another one!,muacjdiscussion,dgyha11,9,t5_342em
