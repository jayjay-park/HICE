No one has a safe position.WHen asked a question about the QB for next season at the press conference earlier this week the coach replied that when a team goes  no ones position is set. We are going to evaluate the players in spring and see who works best. The starter in spring might not end up being the starter in fall also. it is all about who performs best and brings FLorida the best shot at winning.People think that Driskel will probably end up starting Grier redshirting and the second QB recruit will be backup but Grier will have an opportunity to win the starting jobedit articlegtHELP WANTED Expect the  spring practices to be allout battles as Muschamp has publicly opened up every position. Yes including QB. Freshman QB Will Grier is among nine early enrollees and will compete against Driskel and Skyler Mornhinweg. Every positions open Muschamp said. Every position.

243172,0,t3_1ww9um,My favorite thing about being a Gator? The sense of family. The sense of success. The knowledge that the university you support is on the cutting edge of the medical world along with many other fields. Knowing youre  in at least  sports every year. Knowing the feeling of relevancy. The orange and blue that is instantly recognizable. Most everything.Why am I a Gator Well you see I had a rough upbringing to say the least. An alcoholic mother multiple stepmothers severe poverty to the point of homelessness etc. I was living in Northern California. By the time I was in th grade I had severe depression. I was classified as what you might consider goth or emo all black clothing long hair dark music all of that. I had no interest in sports or anything at all really. I was in a very dark place. My father who was also broken possibly worse than me reconnected with his high school sweetheart whom he met while in the Navy stationed in Orlando. They were actually engaged but were forced to cut things off when my dad was restationed to Hawaii. Anyway they started talking again and decided God wanted them to get back together because they were supposed to get married anyway. The only obstacle was that she now lived in Knoxville TN AKA enemy territory. So we ended making the big decision to move all the way out here. We moved and come to find out my new stepmother was born and raised in Gainesville and is a huge Gator fan. I found sports as a refuge with the help of my stepmother. I decided on UF as my team of choice as a thanks to her. Sports helped me get over my depression and completely changed me. Now Im  and life is great thanks to the University of Florida.,FloridaGators,cf5ygfs,8,t5_2qv2r

1731651,0,t3_2e8806,To be fair the Office of Student Life and UAA have been doing this for all athletes for at least  years. As a three year letter winner in football I saw first hand many of these classes. While the intent is noble I felt they were somewhat lacking in how much really stuck with the guys.Its amazing what some fellow teammates education and life experiences completely left them unprepared for i.e. college or the real world. However you can make the guys sit in meetings nonstop but that doesnt necessarily mean they will listen. I sat right there and watched as guys goofed off and played on phones or ignored the speakers. Most guys had the mentality of whatever Im going pro but it never sunk in until they were standing there giving senior speeches to younger guys who also wouldnt listen about taking advantage of the chances they were given. I would rather see more support for the student athletes after football. Its the guys that were brought in that didnt go to the next level that need the most help. If we give them a scholarship to play a sport and destroy their bodies I believe the athletes also deserve the best assistance the school can provide to really make a difference after the sport. These athletes can be beacons of opportunity and examples in their often lower income communities after they play the sport but they truly need to be given the support after they are athletically viable. We would often joke about being in the meat grinder or part of the machine. If UF could have a greater impact on creating a better person for after football I would be the happiest guy on earth.There are so many fellow teammates who just fall off the map after football because they were already from very low socioeconomic backgrounds and were really attending school to play football. With counselors funneling them into sports and recreation degrees or other easy areas.I love my alma mater and bleed orange and blue but as some one who has gone on to pursue advanced degrees primarily in education and higher education I look back and have mixed emotions. Yes there will be people that say they already get too much but the college community at large has no concept of where most of my fellow teammates came from their home circumstances the dramatic differences between high school and college for these guys and the brutal toll on your body and your daily routine just to play a sport and HOPEFULLY get a worthwhile degree along the way. But when you were done with eligibility or playing I found that guys who did not go pro were often just released back to wherever they were from and hope that a UF alum would find them a job.Granted things may have changed under Muschamp but the administration of the UAA and The Office of Student Life has changed very little since I was there.I type this not as a cynical athlete who was slighted or mishandled or didnt get to play I type this as a scholarshipped athlete with three consecutive letters and multiple team honors who was lucky enough to be good at something and would have gone to college anyways. I was a fan that got to run out in the greatest stadium in the nation and enjoyed every minute of it but I can not forget that there wereare many guys that could have benefited more form the college experience to go back to their communities and truly  make a difference and realistically make a huge influence in recruiting. I just want UF to be the best all around and produce the caliber of indviduals that would make the school the best in the nation for years to come.TLDR I played I have opinions I ranted Go Gators Go Jesus,FloridaGators,cjxftlk,2,t5_2qv2r

1889424,0,t3_2g95wq,If the players are almost all adamantly against it what is the point of even doing the experiment? The only real advantage is its cheaper. It hurts more to play on and it causes more injuries.I mean someone had to be the guinea pig. FIFA doesnt care about any of the players men or women. The only reason they are doing it to the women is because the women make less money and less people watch the womens one. If the mens cup was less popular and made less than the womens one then theyd be the ones getting experimented on.Im not saying its right. Its just a soulless business decision rather than a sexist one.You have an option of group A and group BYou have to choose one for the experimentGroup A is more popular and gets much more visibility. If the experiment fails theyll take a bigger financial hit and piss off the fans moreGroup B is less popular. It gets less visibility. If the experiment fails then compared to group A FIFA would lose less money. Some people would still be pissed but itd be less than if it happened to group AIts the difference between Cristiano Ronaldo tears his ACL after losing his footing running in for a strike against Ghana. Are FIFAs new fields to blame? Is FIFA putting profits over player safety? and what would follow is every sports media outlet ripping FIFA a new asshole. Almost everyone would know FIFAs changes caused this injury. Shoot the big world news channels might even devote segments talking about FIFAs greedy change. Itd be yet another PR nightmare.Compared to US striker Alex Morgan tears ACL in competition today vs Canada. Morgan is expected to be out  months. and for the ESPN broadcast theyd immediately cut over to discussion of the consistency and size of Johnny Manziels morning shit. The only people thatll really get pissed are those that are fans of the womens game. The majority of the world wouldnt realize it happened or why it happened.It sucks but thats just how it is.FIFA is greedy corrupt and gives zero real shits about the players fans or communities they exploit to line their pockets. This is just a business decision. If there was a coed version of soccer that was even less popular and visible than the womens game theyd choose them to experiment on.They arent being treated different specifically because they are women and the heads of FIFA care about men more. Theyre being treated different because they are less popular.I hate artificial turf and I hate a decision like this that is only made because of greed but trying to assign the wrong intent to this helps nothing and just serves to distract people from the real point FIFA doesnt care about any players safety. Not just womens. If they could get by making the mens game more dangerous to make more money without stirring up as much media theyd do it in a heartbeat.This writer wants to make it like its FIFA vs women. No its FIFA vs players. They made a soulless business decision in order to experiment with players while causing the least controversy in the real media and taking less of a PR hit should the experiment fail.I bet they already have charts numbers and graphs lined up to see the  increase in injuries changing from grass to turf will cause in the cup and if it is below a certain number then itll be deemed acceptable to gradually transition the mens game over to that too. They probably have a value attached to players and how much of a financial hit theyd take should a certain number of players get injured for each player injured they lose a slight bit of money from the fans and they have slightly less interest. If the financial hit for losing  more players is more than the money saved from switching over to turf then theyd go back to grass if  or more get injured. If turf causes only an increase in  players then itd be acceptable losses and turf kept.They can extrapolate the experiment to the mens game. Say the mens game is twice as popular and makes twice as much. Now losing  players would be an equal financial hit as losing  womens players. If turf causes an increase of  injuries then its deemed not a good investment to transition the mens game to turf while it is a good one to transition the womens game to it.Its a lot more complicated than that but thats just a simplified example.Its a business decision in order to test the waters as safely for them to insulate themselves from controversy as possible so they can see the costbenefit analysis of if they should make this change.FIFA makes their decisions based solely on what can make them the most money. They dont care about the actual players or their gender. They just know that group B is a lot better for them to attempt the experiment on than group A because of the insane popularity of group Atldr this is a player issue not a gender issue. If it is deemed that screwing the men over in a similar way will make them more money theyd do it in a heartbeat. FIFA only cares about making money. Every decision they make should be looked at from the POV okay why did FIFA do this and how does it make them protect the  they already have. It sucks its not right but thats the nature of the beast. As long as the womens game is less popular and draws in less money theyll be the more likely candidate to do controversial experimental changes to compared to the mens game doing it to the women is cheaper and its safer from a PR standpoint.With these big organizations FIFA NFL NBA MLB its all about making money and insulating yourselves from controversy. These organizations do not actually care about the fans or players they make business decisions based on what helps their business the most. The NFL doesnt care about domestic violence they would make more money if they didnt have to suspend the players at all if they could just keep the best players always on the field but thats piss people off and theyd end up taking a hit in the media and thus a few  points loss of profits. The recent PR nightmare caused by public outrage threatened their profits and threatened the execs jobs so they changed the policy. Goodell was a dumbass so now its a bigger clusterfuck. The owners need to make a business decision and cut the dead weight that only serves to make them look worse in terms of PR. If goodell is forced to step down the owners arent doing it because its the right thing to do they are doing it because it best protects their investment.The NBA had turned a blind eye to Sterlings racism in the past. Only reason they didnt a few months ago was because of the public outrage. The commish and owners made a decision to get rid of the man that was dead weight devaluing their investments by making the fans hate the league.Despite what some people claim when these stories come up negative press and PR nightmares do cause a  drop in profits. No you wont get the majority of people to stop watching over one incident but fans will only deal with so much before they reach a breaking point and tune out. It was a better business decision to force Sterling out and allow him to get a fair billion payment for his team that he only paid mil forWe might love sports but lets be honest here. To the people running this shit thats the only thing that matters gt Its a business. Always look at this stuff as a business decision,FloridaGators,ckgv8mp,2,t5_2qv2r

Ranked  in the nation in passing D?We had Wright Haden Joiner Black Spikes Dustin Doe were all on there and we sucked. They were talented but young and inexperienced.It is incredibly rare for freshmen DBs to do what VH did last year. Most freshmen DBs arent good until theyve had time to adapt. We have so so many freshmen we are depending on in that secondary. Thats the one area I know we will improve on as time goes on.Young guys make mistakes with busted coverages they get beat by amazing upperclassmen receivers. Our guys with experience arent talented our guys with talent arent experienced. Only guy thats really doing well up to his potential is VH.We already have those players on the team it just takes time to get them good. TRob is a good DBs coach. I didnt expect them to make this many mistakes but theyre young. They suck now but besides VH I bet in yrs another of those DBs will be in the NFL too.Ive never seen a secondary have to go with so many young guys.

Another thing is that now at least recruits can rest easy that barring unforeseen circumstance such as nonfootball related firing or being hired by the NFL things that are possible anywhere re PetrinoChip Kelly respectively the coach that they sign with will be there at least until they are NFL eligible.

2466350,0,t3_2nstzn,At no point during the  weeks following last years game did I think we would be anywhere near competitive in this game. So I should be okay with a five point loss on the road. But dammit this last week... FSU looked so vulnerable to the few things this team does well. And then for all but about  minutes they fell into our trap.But playcalling and the usual illtimed penalties just killed any shot we had.Im not going to pile on Treon too much just yet. For a true freshman in this system I think hes overachieved. He made some mistakes tonight but far fewer than I would expect from a true freshman. And I shudder to think what Driskel would have done out there. That said I dont expect the next coach will name Treon the starter from day one. We dont even know what kind of offense were going to get. So lets open the competition. I have to admit though that Im less than excited for the bowl game. I will watch it and support the team and live and die with the outcome. But I sort of just want this season  and this era to be over and done with.I want Foley to hire a coach soon.

2487277,0,t1_cmj64e0,Im not saying our academics our poor Im saying that the graduation rates as represented by the ncaa do not mean what most people think they mean.  We actually do a phenomenal job still but people have no idea what the actual graduation rate is for football players and hell alot of people assume they come back for degrees which has happened but is far from the likely outcomeThere is a large disparity between the average student population graduation rate and the student athlete grad rate.  But to say that the University if Florida or any other big time school graduates anywhere close to the numbers of student athletes in football as those numbers the ncaa  claim is misleading. Let me rephrase it again according to the NCAA our reported graduation rate is  most people take that to mean that for every  football players that come  to the university florida  will graduate from the university of florida with a degree.  That is not the case.  Look back at my other comments to see how the NCAA comes up with those numbers. The true number is about  will graduate from UF the number that is actually reported to the federal government and has more stringent and acceptable standards. You say attrition and transferring and all that isnt new and is normal im not faulting that.  But does that mean you can  tell me that an attrition rate of  is ok?  Such as out a company of men in battle loosing half is okay?  Or if half the student body that applied to UF and got in failed to graduate in reasonable time five years or less for an under graduate degree because the NCAA is even utilizing the standard measurement time for university graduation research they are using a six year model. That would be acceptable?But the Ncaa does not conduct this graduation research in the same manner as any higher education research body anywhere.  And so the numbers are falsely elevated to make it look like we every college football program are doing better for an under served population educationally and i can say that as i am part of that student athelete population and witnessed first hand the number of guys who actually left and dont receive a degree but are able to be shuffled around in the numbers.Im not looking for negative. I just think people should examine data first and not blindly accept what the Ncaa or any reporter says.  Sorry typed up on mobile Tldr. The ncaa statistically inflates graduation numbers in order to appear to be doing more ,FloridaGators,cmj84ke,1,t5_2qv2r

The shitty part about it is to compete with a guy like Meyer you have to become like him. There are very few people who have his kind of success that come by it honestly whatever that even means Saban comes to mind but he may do sketchy shit too in fact it seems like you have to The bigger the salaries get the higher the TV contract dollars get the more people like Meyer we will see having success. Its tough because I really love the game of football but when you see good guys finish last and NFL stars killing themselves to get rid of the demons in their brains it makes me wonder if were just watching a form of glorified gladiators and people who live in the future will look at us and say those people were really awful for doing thisend rant. ,FloridaGators,cojljx0,15,t5_2qv2r

5108166,0,t1_cv1oz7m,As big of an impact VH has based on what I saw Saturday Id argue that Neal returning will actually make a bigger impact. Our Safety play has been questionable at best with Marcell Harris looking especially confused while Tabor and Wilson have looked great at Corner. Assuming were shorthanded at LB we may need to have a safety play at a hybrid type of position or use  DBs in a dime defense. Also I was at the game on Saturday and Tabor seems to have stepped into Dante Fowlers role as the onfield hype man cheerleader. The Swamp was loud for having K empty seats and he was repeatedly asking the crowd for more noise and dancing between plays. I dont know if that translates to him being a leader for the defense on the sideline but I wouldnt be surprised at all.I digress. Having those VH and Neal back would have probably translated to  fewer points for ECU which would have made things a lot more comfortable.,FloridaGators,cv1q4jg,3,t5_2qv2r

I think he is a black president who is addressing obvious issues in our country. I cant think of a time that he has discussed race when race wasnt the topic.Read my explanation to your next quotegtDid you watch the Dallas PD speech he made? Honestly it will go down as one of the best speeches made by a President not to mention GW Bushes was also one of the best speeches I have ever heard. If you listen to what the President says and not clips and inlfuence this is just totally wrong unless you think that holding police accountable for actions is making every police officer a bad guyYes I did watch it and it was a good speech... until the very end where again he had to make it black vs white. To be honest I was very very surprised that GWB made such a great speech I did not expect that.

9813269,0,t1_dama3gi,I believe in Mac. Whenever we have a tough decision to make it always seems like a ballsy call and weve made them a lot more often than we did for the past few years. I think the Program has a good plan for the future and we uncover a lot of these  star players who perform very well.But Nuss is a disaster. The playcalling is awful. I see people here complaining about running too many bubble screens... What!? We dont run enough bubble screens. We throw maybe  or  a game. We dont get the ball in Callaway or Powell hands enough. Yeah we throw too many short passes but the major problem is there is no creativity with any of them.I dont want to shift from McElwains offensive philosophy but there have to be better options than Nuss. Doug hasnt been helpful on the recruiting trail either.

10239226,0,t1_dc4o3eg,The sample size is smaller so it probably looks worse. The biggest factor to the success or failure of a left handed QB is the offensive line. Your RT is now the blind side protector and its sometimes difficult for a LT which is usually the teams best tackle to switch to RT. Offensive schemes have to be altered to go from right handed QB to left handed QB. It may no seem like its a big deal but it can make it difficult for a team to adjust to a left handed QB when most of these guys have played right handed QBs their whole career. ,FloridaGators,dc4o9ai,4,t5_2qv2r

10623585,0,t1_ddbpt49,If youre assuming a bowl win then were not too far off on expectations but I think a bowl should be a  proposition as in theory the opponents should be fairly closely matched and its played at a neutral location.I like the breakdown by game that uExternalTangents performed here which netted out to . expected wins.  I might quibble with one or two percentages and you may have a more optimistic take than him and thats fine but Im using his numbers as an example here.  If you then consider the bowl as worth . wins assuming its a  proposition and add it to the expected . regular season wins then we get to . wins overall.   wins feels reasonable to me but heres the important part to keep in mindThis is not a minimum much as we would like it to be but an expected average.  Expected averages have confidence intervals so the true expected range of wins is probably something   games so perhaps in the  or  range.Side note Andy Hutchins at alligatorarmy.com makes the same type of expected wins calculation and updates it before every game  Im a fan of that approach.So for me Im hoping for at least  wins but I think it sets the bar far too high to consider  or  as the floor for a successful season.  Id be disappointed with  wins even though they are in my realistic range of possibilities given a reasonable confidence interval based entirely on gut feel as I have no stats to back it up.Now if we get to eight wins with a marked improvement in offense some style points keeping it close and competitive in most of our losses and visible improvement and development of our young players and in particular our QB then I wouldnt be too disappointed.In summary I see  games as my realistic floor for a reasonably acceptable season and I could be feeling pretty good about  games if they play out with the improvements I outlined above.,FloridaGators,ddbqpws,1,t5_2qv2r

The noon sportscenter show coast to coast and the couple episodes I have seen of The six are cringe worthy at times. The anchors dont know how to interview  they sound more like TMZ reporters than actual sports journalists. I still do watch late night sportscenter sometimes though I do like SVP.

He brings something to the team and there is a reason that he has been starting for three years under two different coaches.,FloridaGators,dfe8id9,4,t5_2qv2r

11493972,0,t1_dfysqmv,Dude....Red lightning was the ballboy at FSU. Not a user. I get it  youre super pro CFB. But realize the fine lines are what make it annoying and what is considered clearly joking depends on the mod. You realize Morty is on like his th username because hes been banned so many times frim previous accounts. I am amazed the mods havent picked up on that. Again  the how the rules are broken and when that is enforced is what is the most annoying. I dont report things because thats not me  but dear god people get away with alot of shit.  I dont really care enough about reddit as a part of my life to create a new username just to participate on that sub.  In the meantime they can let it go to the folks like Morty and what not.

11602653,0,t3_65kld6,For FSU its like looking at a funhouse mirror version of ourselves. They are extremely similar to our own fanbase. They have a higher share of vapid sorority girlfratboy douchebags per capita and we have a higher share of nerds per capita. But beyond that its like having a twin brother that you want to see fail so mom and dad will love you more and give you better Christmas presents. There are lots of little reasons stacked up that intensify and focus the hatred but proximity similarity and familiarity are the basis the rest is just dressing atop the garden salad of hatred. For Miami its just the fans. They can be summarized in one word Wifebeater. You can contextualize that word in a number of different ways and it always fits the majority of Miami fans. Just a genuinely unpleasant group of human beings for the most part.   ,FloridaGators,dgb64oc,11,t5_2qv2r
