HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION! Nominee Hugo Retro Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. There isnt any other book is SFFantasy quite like Jack Vances The Dying Earth published as a cheap  cent paperback back in  by Hillman Publications. I wish it had been picked up by Ballantine Books and published along with some other early classics of the early s like The Space Merchants Childhoods End More Than Human Fahrenheit  Bring the Jubilee etc.Based on the Dying Earth books of the Hugo awardwinning author Jack Vance the core game has been expertly written by Robin D. I respect The Dying Earth but we are just not meant to be together.more Maybe you will pick up an old paperback copy of one of his earlier books and fall in love and devour everything else he has written. It s a bleak yet fascinating universe. One of my favourite aspects which Ive stolen I mean borrowed in a few stories is the limitation he places on magic.If I do characters are mere humanshaped blobs I don t see faces. Visualizing for me ends up more like a radio play than television. So I tend to prefer dialogue to description action to imagery. I can recognize Vance s penchant for the latter but a lot of it is lost on me. And I cannot keep his aeons and his places straight for the life of me I love that maps have become commonplace at the front of newer fantasy.The various civilizations of Earth have collapsed for the most part into decadence and its inhabitants overcome with a fatalistic outlook. The next two books The Eyes of the Overworld and Cugel s Saga  follow the adventures of Cugel the Clever an amoral likeable rogue who lives on his wits. However he is not perfect or infallible he created the flawed T sais and needs Turjan to retrieve a magical relic for him in order to defeat an old foe. The dialog is formal and stilted but deliberately so in a way that makes each story read like a classic legend.It catalogs previous publication of three chapters without remark on the degree of revision. Flutic  the first part of the first chapter published separately in the Italian anthology Fantasy March  and rereleased in English in Coup de Grace and Other Stories a sampler of the Vance Integral Edition The Inn of Blue Lamps The Seventeen Virgins  from FampampSF October .   ,memefreezone,cx9ehmp,1,t5_2tz8s
