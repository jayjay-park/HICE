We wrote device drivers and modified filesystems.  Thats what you should be looking for.  I think its best you phone screen people first.  Asking questions lile    difference between an inode and a vnode    how to reference a struct member in C   Whats an ioctlIf they can answer these you have a pretty good reason to interview them in person.  Some people here recommended hiring seasoned admins and those with the RHCE sorry but those dont mean you know much at all about the kernel and its intricacies.  You will have a far better chance hiring somebody who atleast has taken a OS CS course in college.  When I was in school I knew quite a few people who were like me and knew this stuff.  You really just need to reach out to school who have a kernel hacking class.  Its usually a second OS course that is much more difficult.  ,linuxadmin,cfgtviw,4,t5_2r9lc

What happens when additional security updates or bug fixes are released between Monday and Tuesday and you do a blanket system update?

1503174,0,t3_2aw4vv,Not sure if your issue is resolved yet but you might try the following steps to help resolve your issue.NOTE  The following steps are for RHELCentOS.. Pop in your RHELCentOS installation media and boot from it.. Choose Rescue Installed System.. First  things its going to ask for are Language Keyboard Type and Media Location.  Make sure you choose Local CDDVD Media for Media Location.. You will be prompted to start up network interfaces select NO.. You will then be asked if you want to mount the local volumes in readwrite read only mode skip.  Select SKIP. . Next you will be asked to either Launch a shell run diagnostics or reboot the system.  Choose LAUNCH SHELL. Once you are at the command prompt issue the following commands.. pvscan  This will scan the physical volumes in the machine and determine if any of them contain LVM data.. vgscan  This will scan the physical volumes and identify if any Volume Groups are available.. vgchange ay  This will bring all found Volume groups online to work with.. lvscan  This will scan the volume groups and activate the logical volumes.. You should now be able to do a df h and see all of your LVMs that are configured for your system.  Test this and validate it.   . Now if you are renaming your Logical Volumes lvroot lvhome lvwhateveryounamedit this will be the time to rename those.. NOTE  You may not be able to directly use the lvm commands lvreduce lvextend or lvrename.  If this is the case make sure you precede all commands with lvm.  Example lvm lvreduce L G devVGNameherelvroot resizefs.. lvm lvrename ltvolumegroupheregt ltoldlogicalvolumenameheregt ltnewlogicalvolumenameheregt. Conversely you can also do lvm lvrename devvgnamehereoldlogicalvolume devvgnameherenewlogicalvolume..  Example lvm lvrename vgtrollface lvroot lvdickbutt.  This renames lvroot to lvdickbutt in volume group vgtrollface. . Once the LV has been renamed you need to modify your bootgrubgrub.conf.. You should see a line like this  kernel vmlinuz...el.x ro rootdevmappervgtrollfacelvroot rdNOLUKS LANGenUS.UTF rdNOMD SYSFONTlatarcyrhebsun crashkernelauto rdLVMLVvgtrollfacelvroot  KEYBOARDTYPEpc KEYTABLEus rdNODM rdLVMLVvgtrollfacelvswap rhgb quiet. change it to the following  kernel vmlinuz...el.x ro rootdevmappervgtrollfacelvdickbutt rdNOLUKS LANGenUS.UTF rdNOMD SYSFONTlatarcyrhebsun crashkernelauto rdLVMLVvgtrollfacelvdickbutt  KEYBOARDTYPEpc KEYTABLEus rdNODM rdLVMLVvgtrollfacelvswap rhgb quiet. Once this has been done save the file and now review your etcfstab.. Your first line should be your root volume . Make sure that your device path is now devmappervgtrollfacelvdickbutt instead of devmappervgtrollfacelvroot. Save the file.. Reboot and you should be golden. TLDR  There isnt one you have to read the whole thing .  I hope this is helpful and that you can get your machine back online.  Good luck!     ,linuxadmin,cj4p2xj,1,t5_2r9lc

1947619,0,t1_cknvobl,Its a bit different. Unix has generally had source code available since the beginning although the ATampT versions were generally protected by license. Still there was a lot of crossfertilization between the various unices that helped the bug and feature situation out a lot. That doesnt exist in the enterprise software world.Also the communities are very different. Theres always been much closer ties with the developer and var communities with unix than with the database crowd. The community would often produce enhancements that would only be adopted by more mainstream unices after they went through a crucible of usage. That helps a lot in keeping stable releases coming.And... there are plenty of examples of flavors of unix dying out because they were too unstable and couldnt keep their customers. Meanwhile new vendors came along to take their place. This does happen in the enterprise software world but its amazing just how sticky enterprise software is once its embedded into an organization.So I dont think the situations are comparable.

2208892,0,t1_clkfwqp,Using Chef Puppet Cfengine etc. you can put hosts in groups depending on the application. group A would get yum repo A. Group B would get yum repo B and so on.Then your createrepo wrapper API thing would say that user A can publish to repo A. User B can publish to repo B and so on. It can also permission based on package name so that you can create a name space mycompanygroupApackageAversionBlah.rpm. Then when the person uploads the RPM to the API you validate it sign it createrepo and done.Also your API should validate based on package contents. No file should be owned by root etc. so that if the users dont have root rights they cant use the RPM to get it.Building RPMs is actually very easy once you get the hang of it. Read the maxrpm guide for the details of the spec file. The trick is setting the topdir macro to a temp directory to not use usrsrc and making sure you have file permissions right in the spec file since the user skibumatbu may not exist on hosts. I usually keep a buildme.sh script and the spec file in the same directory. Then a source directory with the tar balls.  All of that gets put in an SVN repo.,linuxadmin,clklreb,2,t5_2r9lc

2598799,0,t1_cmh25qc,With Gentoo you wouldnt have to update anything when apache updates  youd just get a new patched version as long as the patch still applies cleanly.  However the real advantages of Gentoo come when you want to start messing with core system dependencies.  With Gentoo it wouldnt really be much harder to run a nonstandard patched version of glibc as long as all the software is still compatible with it.  Doing that on something like CentOS would be a nightmare since you would have to repackage EVERYTHING against the new version.  Of course glibc would be an odd package to do this to but I imagine there are many libraries where it might be useful to be able to tweak them.  Gentoo lets you modify any package and then still track distro updates on everything else.,linuxadmin,cmxst7j,1,t5_2r9lc

2764370,0,t3_2rqem5,I hope my comment is not misinterpreted and taken as inflammatory.To answer the question Why is Ubuntu arguably so buggy?. I think Ubuntus goals are significantly different from Debians and RHELs. Ubuntus goal is to get its distro into the hands of as many different users as possible. . It targets the desktop server and now mobile. This means supporting a lot of different software. It also means writing software to solve very bigbroad problems e.g. Mir arguable LaunchpadPPAs Click packages Ubuntu SDK. To reach as many users as possible Ubuntu needs to not only stand out amongst Windows and Mac OS X but also other Linux distros why choose Ubuntu over ...  to help differentiate itself Ubuntu creates software like Unity.. Finally it aims to provide a regular release cycle every  months while still providing support for businessenterprise  years. This all boils down to Ubuntu has spread itself too thin.IMO UbuntuLTSs key selling points are. A large number of packages . This is a key selling point over RHELCentOS which provides  much fewer packages in the base repository it should be noted that RHEL provides  years of support for all the software that it ships. See point  for Ubuntus support policy.. A regular release cycle every  years. This is a key selling point over Debian which releases a new stable once every  years but ships on a when its ready policy and RHEL which doesnt really offer any known systematic cycle.. Support for  years. Support is provided to only a fraction of the k packages that ship with Ubuntu. However on face value  years is better than Debians  years but it is much shorter than RHELs  years.. Ubuntu through good marketing its desktop and its community has mindshare which means that rd party software developers aim to providesupport their software on Ubuntu.I personally recommend Debian stable for server systems when Debian stables relatively short supportcycles  years do not pose any issues. The main reasons I recommend Debian. Its released when its ready. This means that Debian does not have some arbitrary delivery date to adhere to. Debian will remove noncore packages that have ReleaseCritical RC bugs.. Debian package maintainers are closer to upstream Ubuntu sources most of its packages from Debian. This means IMO that Debian package maintainers have a better understanding of the software they have closer relationships with upstream authors and they are more capable of finding and fixing bugs.. Debian stays comparatively closer to upstream While Debian does modify software so that it adheres to Debians packaging guidelines Debian is closer to upstream than Ubuntu e.g. it does not patch GTK and the various GNOME programs. It uses a relatively stock GNOME as its default desktop. Debian will probably use Wayland.. Debian changes at a slower pace. Ubuntu ships a release every  months. Debian ships a release every  years.For these reasons I think Debian is a more stable Linux distro.Looking at Ubuntus  key sellingpoints I think Debian can match  of them. The large number of packages kk come from Debian and are available in Debian. If theyre not available in stable theyre probably available via backports.. Debian has provided a regular release cycle every  years since .Etch. Etch was released in .. Debian only provides  years of support. However Debian LTS see  aims to extend this to  years. If Debian LTS were to become a regular thing I think it would be a huge win for Debian over Ubuntu.. A nonregular release cycle can also be seen as a negative. You cannot plan for the next version. However Debian has been much more consistent with releases since .Etch releasing a new stable version approximately every two years.,linuxadmin,cniaqin,31,t5_2r9lc

So running a microservice you build all this in to the dockerfile.This is all new to me and have been spending some time with it.  To me this builds on the microservice concept to run everything without a bunch of overhead.  Example is using Jetty to run java application instead of a bunch of infrastructure like Tomcat with config files all over you just distribute a single build and use java jar ltfilegt and thats it.  So you take this concept and now can be used for many things and dont have all the OS overhead.

4304556,0,t1_csahky4,gtYou are arguing that some mail clients may fall back to unencrypted connections even though they are configured to do STARTTLS.That is not what I said.I said that if a client which is configured for plain text connects to a server running STARTTLS which is configured to require encryption then the client may ignore the request to ugrade to connection to encrypted and still send unencrypted credentials instead of the intended behavior of returning a sane error message.This is obviously a security concern because the credentials have been sent in plain text and anyone snooping can grab them.This is NOT the case with POPSIMAPS though. If a client configured for plain text connects to a server running POPSIMAPS then it will never receive a readable response from the server and so will never reach the step of sending the credentials.They both support the same protocols and ciphers. The fact that STARTTLS starts out as an unencrypted connection and has unpredictable client behavior means that POPSIMAPS is more secure than STARTTLS.

My opinion is that its almost never wise to jump major releases via an update.  Nukeinstall new for a clean baseline for major version rolls.But to your last question which Ill assume is related to policy rather than tools...Answer  it depends on your site and its industry and constraints and percentage uptime requirements. Ive seen several approaches periodically update everything taking the position that the upstream vendor is smarter than you and that if it was worth their labor to developtestrelease an update that it must be worth doing. or use your labor to assess relevance.  Do you need that kernel update that only affects libvirt libraries for local users when you dont use libvirt and you have no local users for your server ? or just apply security updates frequently and possibly do a full update much more rarely to catch up on general bug fixesMy current thinking is  do not autoinstall unless youre doing it on a test system to pretest whether doing XYZ will work handsoff.  Ive seen too many autoinstall updates break systems.  update security patches frequently.  All of them.  Some of the CVE info is pretty hard to decipher so I tend to just rely on the upstream vendor to do the assessments.  Not automatic updates but frequent enough occasional updates.  Like monthly unless theres a do it now emergent crisis kind of vulnerability that pops up  catch up to bugfix updates occasionally once or twice per year unless Im fighting a bug that has a fix available  definitely develop enough of the devops stuff to be able to easily nukerecreate systems because someday youre going to need to be able to answer gimme another one of those requests for more systems of a previous configuration.  dont distupgrade from distroX to distroX because some day it will bite you.  The upstream distros just dont test that path enough and it takes forever with lots of questions being asked by the packaging systems.  Use your devopsfu to just spin up a new one with the new os baseline.  Far faster and more reliable....did a debian . to . upgrade in a VM as a test  drove me half crazy with questions and options.  Did a clean . install piece of cake.   Im still not sold on distupgrade Ive seen a couple times where that just hoses the system up totally...Ansible is supereasy to spin up on and very very lightweight.  Just needs ssh on the remote side.   Even if you just use it for initial provisioning its a tool you should have in your toolbox.Or if youre CentOS based learn kickstart.

The linked article doesnt mention what binds look like in fstab use none in the filesystem type column and bind in the options column.This allows everything to find everything where it wants it to be including your own muscle memory and thats very important.

5386331,0,t1_cvzyeth,That Varnish is an http rather than an ftp cache is not that important.  OP can throw up nginx and point the  at the media directory.  A chown here and there and he can serve files over http in  minutes.  He can serve the same files over http and ftp at the same time without breaking his current set up.  The issue is I dont know an ftp caching reverse proxy but I do know Varnishs ttl can be adjusted per file type.  See heresub vclfetch         if req.url  .jpg                 set beresp.ttl  s        Varnish can cache in file as well.  You can start with something like this in etcdefaultsvarnish borrowed from a post hereDAEMONOPTSa               T localhost              f etcvarnishdefault.vcl              S etcvarnishsecret              s mallocmand then change the last line in the option string to s filevarcachevarnishvarnishfcache.binG or something suitable.Last but not least Varnish use to download the whole file from the backend if there is no cache hit and then send it back.  Now that is no longer the case.  See this press releaseVarnish . has some support for streaming objects but I cant say that Im very happy with the semantics. It only allows one client to stream the object and others are placed on hold while the object is being streamed. If this client is a G phone downloading a  megabyte object other clients are likely to give up waiting and go and do something else.Theyve fixed this in .x release and there is a white paper for it.  It has far more detail than is suitable for this post but I think the issues are fixed as far as PHK and co are concerned.  ,linuxadmin,cw05x6w,1,t5_2r9lc

7453777,0,t3_4h9z57,Being a nonspecialized sysadmin is something that no certs  degrees can prepare you for. specialized is someone who works on a single product day in and day out for example an exchange admin or an active directory admin... fortune  companies tend to have IT dept that are setup this way due to the size of their IT teams being a linux or windows sysadmin is nonspecialized as you are expected to work on all aspects and not just a single program. In my experience a nonspecialized sysadmin is almost always the one that is most sought after and the one that tends to move from admin level to architect level the quickest. However being nonspecialized is by far the hardest to become.One of the points that is the hardest about the nonspecialized route is that it is impossible to know everything about everything and yet you are almost always expected to. The only way I have known to achieve this is to have a good community to fall back on IRC mailing list etc and be willing to ask when you dont know. The other major thing is to learn googlefoo the ability to ask google a question and get back a relevant answer. This means knowing the language of everything you are working on so that you can hit the correct key words.The other biggest thing about being a NS sysadmin is that you have to have the mindset to be lazy. This means automating everything you do more than a few times so you dont have to do it manually any more. Now being lazy is usually more work up front to save you time down the road. The biggest mistakes always come from human error and automation with proper error checking of course will prevent that. It can be anything from setting up a new employee you dont want to get yelled at for forgetting to create their account on the th system that policy dictates you have to to setting up a new desktop dont forget to install that special driver for the printer that is only used when the driver isnt installed to setting up a new web server oops you left the root password enabled.Whenever I interview someone I ask for their github  VCS version of choice URL. This allows me to see what they actually know as well as their style.I recommend that you take some time to make some automation scripts to do basic tasks setup a domain for apache for example and put them on github. Every sysadmin I know that works on nix has at least made these and most have them public customized just like they like.I also recommend getting a good understanding of how networking works at its foundation. Nothing is worse that trying to track down an issue on a system when the issue lies in the network and having that underlying knowledge would let you know that right away.,linuxadmin,d2pg3st,3,t5_2r9lc

The nullok option is only available in recent versions of the googleauthenticator PAM module though it should work on Jessie without any trouble. This could be used to allow users to log in during a grace period in order to set up TOTP on an existing multiuser systemauth sufficient pamgoogleauthenticator.so nullokAnother consideration for multiuser systems is that googleauthenticator puts the TOTP credentials in control of individual users which might not be ideal in some cases. I dont seem to have any examples of secure TOTP secret storage handy but it might benefit others to know that documentation for implementing that feature exists.

10670422,0,t3_5slizd, There are a couple historical aspects.  First most Nix admins are involved in some way with the community and are working with many like minded individuals. Secondly Nix systems while generally harder to master have historically been significantly easier to diagnose and fix. Third you can could? do much more with much less with Linux systems. Lastly and potentially most important Nix systems have been built with stability as the corner stone for the vast majority of scenarios. Id suggest just looking at getting your RHCSA for starters if going down the LinuxUnix path.  Many skills are transferable between different distributions and operating systems.  Not everyone appreciates the RHCSA but its a good way to show youre not going to accidentally delete the companies web site.  Id also suggest looking into at least basic CiscoJuniper certs to add to your value  which youve already stated youd like to do. I script everything I have to do repetitively.  You need to know either sh or bash and pythonperl will just extend your ability to automate repetitive tasks that arent really fun.  As for comparisons to JS... I hate programming in JS and I love shell scriptingpython because they are intuitive.  Bash is really just learning how to use a handful of tools and how to get them to work together to move mountains.  Any text filewebsiteetc can be either parsed or manipulated however you wantneed and then you can do whatever you want with that data.  Want to put it all in a database? No problem.  Want to just find a particular needle in the haystack? Even easier. This part is tough.  Do you enjoy storage arrays or networking madness or security?  Look into the UNIXes like FreeBSD OpenBSD etc...  Do you want cutting edge software platforms then look towards Linux distributions like Ubuntu Fedora or even Arch.  Do you want rock solid stability? Look at the FreeBSD RHELCentOS and Debian.  Like I mentioned above  once you know one well enough you can figure out the others relatively easily because your skills translate for the most part between all the UNIX like operating systems.   That all being said CentOS isnt a bad place to start.,linuxadmin,ddgkn9u,2,t5_2r9lc

11022022,0,t1_deh62pq,Yes. Ive very much considered both and CloudReady would be the simplest option. my fifth grade class actually had flash drives with it for use at the lab. And PXE booting LTSP via Edubuntu or similar would be trivial but the national curriculum is based on Windows.,linuxadmin,dehbdvb,1,t5_2r9lc

11092327,0,t3_5yb15c,I have the same problem. Large amount of logs and devs want to search it. But they rarely want old data so now im doing Last B messages searchable through graylog around TB in elasticsearch and roughly  days of logs Rest of the logs in gzipped files named yymmddtypeHH.log.gzThat way they can use the GUI  of the time and the last  is done with zgrep which isnt bad if you roughly know the time you want,linuxadmin,depb02c,2,t5_2r9lc

11151624,0,t1_de1w2fr,just relooking up the slack thing did you guys get started? the invite link is dead so I dunno if it got off the ground.also I passed RHCE if you found RHCSA easy then if you had a good study method for it you should be alright. Dont get me wrong its HARD but I thought the same about RHCSA actually I found the amount of things you had to know for RHCSA a lot wider RHCE is narrower in scope and that made it somewhat easier to focus I found. ,linuxadmin,dew0w54,1,t5_2r9lc

11321579,0,t3_61ia9x,If i had to do this i would probably do it something like this. Yes you need seperate subnets but noone said the subnet had to be large a  and some routes will do.On machine   ip addr add ... dev eth  ip route add ... dev eth  ip route add ... via ...  On machine   ip addr add ... dev eth  ip route add ... dev eth  ip route add ... via ...  On machine   ip addr add ... dev eth  ip route add ... dev eth  ip route add ... dev eth  Its all napkinroutes didnt test it.,linuxadmin,dffa5rq,1,t5_2r9lc

11550162,0,t1_dg4wb1m,gt I know people who frown against it as security through obscurity.Obscurity is a valid layer of security.  Anything you can do to slow an attacker down or distract them from attacking you helps.For example Ive got an ssh day ! I can go to shodan now and get a list of all IPs listening on port  but your port  isnt going to be on that list.  But I dont care Ive got millions of other people to hit before I start looking at you.Its like owning a dog.  Bad guy is probably going to break in to your neighbors house that doesnt have a dog unless hes already specifically targeting you.,linuxadmin,dg57poo,3,t5_2r9lc
11730337,0,t3_67d6in,So you say you dont want to get rid of the data.  What are you going to use it for?  If you have no real use get rid of it.  However rather then compress it you could parse the data to get the overall picture of what happened rather than keeping the raw data. Use a log analyzer and save the reports rather than the G of data.  If you cant afford to keep that data offload elsewhere and have no real need for it you really should get rid of it.  ,linuxadmin,dgpnx5p,3,t5_2r9lc

11741992,0,t3_67ju1j,Certainly. If I high percentage of memory is used but a huge chunk of it is being used as cachebuffers no big deal. But if there is hardly any assigned to cachebuffers then there is at least the possibility that you might start seeing issues soon if your system decided it needs to access more memory. You may also start seeing increased IO access times. ,linuxadmin,dgqzgj4,5,t5_2r9lc
