If you play around with the level editor youll actually find that the resources on the maps arent placed at the same resolution as signs that is where a geologist places one sign there are several pixels of resources so even placing on all big signs may not yield  findings but it should be better than placing on mixed  signs or emptys.Additionally resources draw down over time so even if there is initially enough resources to have the mine work at or near  the findings percentage will slowly decrease with time as resources are removed from the map.Finally while you need food to have the miners work the percentage is defined as  of resources found of trips out of mine   so a lack of food wont decrease the mines findings percentage it will simply mean the mine sits idle.,Settlers,d65zek8,1,t5_2u5hq
