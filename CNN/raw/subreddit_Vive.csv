4257421,0,t3_39oqjo,There are plenty of cases where it has gotten very confusing. Ive been working with Oculus Ive seen someone say last week. I had to ask for clarification as he was partaking in a discussion on motion sensors. Turned out he was working with the VR goggles not with the company which completely changes how much value people wouldcouldshould place on what he says.What gets me is how absolutely stubborn people are. Just call the Rift by its proper name already. Its fewer keystrokes less chance of misspelling it no chance of misunderstandings and most of all Palmer Luckey went out of his way to correct itI dont know how much more convincing people need to call the device by its correct name.

5345465,0,t3_3o0543,Got to go out and try it today the experience was really amazing. I tried to go out yesterday and got there just as they were closing on account of the rain but today there was no line at all. They suggested that if we told anyone to go that we tell them after pm should be good.In terms of the experience I knew somewhat about what they were showing people but it was completely different to experience it first hand. Afterward as my wife and I were discussing our experience with it it occurred to me that one of the most impressive things was right off the bat when I had the headset on and the person guiding me through the demo handed out the controllers to me I could see them in the virtual space reached out and grabbed them without even a moment of difficulty locating them although I couldnt see my hands.I cant say enough about how much I loved TheBlu experience by Wevr where youre on a ship underwater and a whale swims by. As I stared into its eye I kept thinking about how much I wish I had had something like this when I was a kid. The Job Simulator was a little odd as the wall was intersecting where one of the tomatoes were that I needed to put into the soup so I had to do some tricky hand work to grab a hold of it incidentally I really liked how it alerts you to the walls presence and while I didnt have a problem with running into it my wife did. Unfortunately I took so long by accidentally dropping the salt shaker etc into the pot and having to fish them out that I didnt get through that entire demo before it moved onto the next one. The next one I cant recall the name of but it was painting in D and was really interesting. I found the lighting too bright but it was still really fun and got me thinking about all the ways a virtual art studio could be brought to life with wacom tablets sensors etc. Finally the Valve Robot Repair demo was fantastic. I did once again waste a lot of time trying to figure out how to hit the button on the robot until the gentleman demoing it for me told me to try the other side and I had the odd experience of walking through what appeared to be a three dimensional solid object in front of me.All in all I came out very impressed and while I came into it optimistic anyway I was glad that my skeptical wife was blown away as well. If youre in the area and havent tried it and have the opportunity I highly recommend it. I just wish I had had the presence of mind to ask more questions instead of ooing and ahhing through the entire thing.,Vive,cvuxyuf,3,t5_378go

They have a lot of leeway as the second movermover with an established platform but at heart they are a company driven by good people who love what they do.But that has fuckall to do with Oculus.  Oculus are not being dicks when they refuse to make promises that they arent able to keep and concentrate on doing the job that the good people there love and want to do which is to give virtual reality the best start they can.  Everything every detractor wants will probably happen but for the love of gaben just let them take their time to get there.  So many of us here act like spoiled children and cry because mommy didnt get us the right color pony.And I know theres a subset of the community that feels neglected because of Linux support but honestly I kind of feel like the Linux community has sort of dropped the ball.  People havent come forward to do amazing things with the advantage that Linux had our good rdocok excepted.  If someone had made a VR window manager or something oculus would probably have bent over backwards but as it is I feel like they laid the egg and it just never hatched so they have to give up at some point and tend to the live chicks who need to grow.  Im probably full of shit on this one but its an impression based on the relative lack of content about Linux on the VR subreddit.  I hear a lot of how good it could be and how angry people are that it isnt catered to but a chorus of crickets when it comes to people doing things.  And I say this as someone who quit his job to make something in VR that they wanted to exist with little hope of recompense.,Vive,cvz74l5,5,t5_378go

5513501,0,t1_cwge4bn,Here is a copy and paste of his post that goes with the videoThe strength of instantaneous teleportation techniques is that they allow player movement without vection and the sensation of motion. The downside is that they dont provide any visual feedback or situational awareness. Being teleported instantly to a different position and especially in a new direction can be disorienting. There is enormous value in the visual flow of information gained during a smooth positional change.This experimental technique which I call Tunneling because of its similarity to tunnel vision is an attempt to marry the strengths of both continuous and instantaneous locomotion. The idea is to confine controller induced vection to only a small central region of the view. This little facelocked viewport tunnel displays continuous motion and allows the user to steer the player just like they normally would in an FPSstyle game. Meanwhile the peripheral view remains at the point of origin so there is no controllerinduced vection in the periphery. This allows the user to feel grounded and motionless while simultaneously steering the player with the firstperson viewport. After the movement is complete the periphery automatically snaps to the new player position but the snap feels seamless because there is no disruption in the forward view. It simply expands to fully engulf the user.So how does it feel? Not too bad in my opinion. The visuals can be slightly confusing if you are not prepared for it or if you pay attention to the periphery. But when you become engaged in the center view the sides fade away from your attention  just as the tunnelvision namesake suggests and controlling the character feels as natural as any FPS. Once you stop to get your bearings the periphery snaps to your location affording you a fully immersive view exactly when you need it. Its a pretty good compromise or as one of my colleagues put it ... hey you know this doesnt completely suck. Which is about all you can hope for when dealing with the intractable problem of VR locomotion.A few more points.  The technique is scalable. You can increase or decrease the size of the tunnel view to increase or decrease vection  although in practice once the view gets too small its a bit unusable for navigation. There is a potentially big rendering penalty. In the naive implementation you have to render two completely different views and composite them. However the lower FOV of the center view makes it less costly to render. Low resolution rendering of the periphery is an obvious optimization that should be considered. For an extreme optimization it might be possible to render the periphery monoscopically or simply as a cube map  although those techniques have potential downside in terms of incorrect parallax. I also experimented with periodicsnapping of the periphery at a fixed interval Hz. That keeps the tunnel from traveling too far and diverging too much from the periphery. It sounds like a good idea on paper but in practice it just seemed to add visual confusion. The whole point of the technique is to reduce visual stimulation in the periphery so periodicsnapping sort of undermines the whole idea. But maybe a slower rate would be ok? Im trying to get this uploaded to Oculus Share in the next couple of days so others can try it out  possibly could release source but it would need to be cleaned up a bunch and I think most devs could replicate this quickly once they have seen it. The Oculus SDK Layer API makes it really easy to do. You just render another layer at a reduced FOV on top of the bottom layer and track the view from two positions. The core mechanic only took a couple of hours to get going and most of the time was spent finessing the details of the transition effects and soon.,Vive,cwgees8,3,t5_378go

5946599,0,t1_cxz2gc4,Its not just the two cameras its really the position of the tracker dots. Oculus put the dots closer to your hands both in height and less radial distance away and that makes it easier to bring the controllers toward your body and occlude them. Valve went for a larger dish of tracker dots on top the controller. Each has their advantages and disadvantages but the camera placement being equal the Vive controllers will have less occlusion typically. Oculus instead went for more hand presencefiner interactions while sacrificing the  trackingwith a typical two camera setup. If you had a Vive controller design just like the Touch controllers you would run into the very similarsame advantages and disadvantages in tracking. If you designed a Touch controller to look like the Vive controllers with a larger dish of LEDs on top of the Touch wand then you would have less occlusion at the expense of not being able to move the controllers as close together as before.,Vive,cxz4nvn,0,t5_378go

6126363,0,t1_cyljb0y,I remember hearing about a technique where the developers would adjust what was displayed to the user in order to control where they moved. For example while running down a straight path the path would be constantly and subtly shifted to the right so that the user unconsciously turned to stay on it. This means that the player feels like theyre walking in a straight line while in reality theyre walking in a circle. Apparently this made it possible to give the illusion of huge ingame spaces while requiring a fairly reasonable indoor VR space.Last I heard they were experimenting to see just how much shift they could get away with and how small of a space this would really be feasible in.

Also there is no reason not to want both HMDs to be successful. The more successful VR is as a whole the better support the HMDs will get overall. It is silly and fanboyish to want one to succeed more than the other. I want it to be less of a console war and more of like picking a computer monitor.

Divide that up between  people  each each person spends a couple hours or so skimming over their section.

Have each of the three people come up with a list of their favorite  then have the group get together and share their lists and whittle it down to the  best.

6384486,0,t1_czfbocy,Thats cool.  Really it is Im not trying to be ironic or anything thats genuinely cool.  I guess Im just generally frustrated about the state of VR gaming.  When I think about VR I think about playing a story where Im the hero.  If you go back and watch STTNG nobody went to the holodeck to slash fruit with swords.  Were there holographic swords and slashing?  Sure but they were on the bow of a pirate ship playing a ships captain sailing the seven seas on search of treasure.The only games that Ive seen that comes close to that is Budget Cuts and The Gallery.  I dont know much about Hover Junkers single player.Its frustrating to me to see these companies develop these singular concepts and build a game around it.  Ninja Trainer  Slashing your sword should be something you do as part of the game not the game.  Job Simulator  combining items to do interesting things with them should be something you do as part of the game not the game.  Windlands using grappling hooks to fly around an area should be something you do as part of the game not the game.  Jeeboman  shooting stuff thats comin at cha should be something you do as part of the game not the game.A game to me is one where Im compelled to move the narrative along and have to do any of the above things because of the circumstances Im placed into.

6411639,0,t3_43hphl,tldr I am nitpicky as hell and should largely be ignored.Alright after reading through this enough points made me wince scratch my head andor flip tables to push me to correctrage at some points. Hover Junkersgt The multiplayeronly game They actually have a single player Oregon Trail style mode in the works Dgt Steering works by looking the direction you want to go and pressing a trigger buttonerr.. No?... Did you fly at all or just watch a dude who only went straight?... Steering works by shoving your gun in a control slot which pops up a little dome. Depending on how you tilt your controller at that point dictates where your ship goes.gt During the lessfrantic shooting practice portion we liked these reloading gestures but we often felt too frantic during a shootout to remember exactly what reallife action was required to complete a reload. Hopefully this system gets some tweaks before the games launch so we can focus more on its satisfying steering and positioning challenges.Dont you dare try to water this game down! The reload mechanic works just fine after you give yourself more than  seconds to get it. I was warned by people who went into hover junkers ahead of me that the reload mechanic takes some getting used to so I spent my target practice time doing nothing but unloading as fast as possible and then reloading. When I got into the fight it wasnt an issue. Audioshieldgt Audioshield Feels like musicmelee Missile Commandand we love itWhat?... .. What?! Missile command is all about timing your shots to intercept crap a few seconds later. If you just had to click a missile and it would explode it would take out nearly all the fun. Comparing this game to that is a crime against both games since. Audioshield is far more reflexive than predictive once you have blue and red dots blowing up in your facewhich is most of the time if you are playing any remotely interesting song P. gt Audioshield strands players in a celestial wasteland where song notes come crashing down from the sky in the form of blue and orange globesOkay while the description here is not wrong I find it misleading. First off I dont remember a wasteland more like an empty tronlike place.  shrugs  Second crashing down from the sky does not describe it right at all. They come flying ataround your facebody from some spot roughly  degrees up. The article even goes on to say If youre worried about neck crane pain know that the dropping orbs angles range from relatively flat to about  degrees... soo... you tell me the come crashing from the sky.... from straight in front of me. .gt putting both shields together to clear purple notesas if this were a musicmelee twist on Missile Command.Stahp et!! It was not clever the first time! To me this is like saying that a laser gun fight is a ranged twist on a lightsaber battle! No! There is ONE piece that links those two things. rages harder than socially acceptable on a ridiculously trivial point Budget Cutsgt Youll use the warp gun to shoot a little blue blob wherever you want to gomeaning you need lineofsight in order to aim those blobs at your next destination.Eh line of sight is not actually required. The ball arcs so you can shoot over desks and through holes. For example at one point in the demo I needed to shoot up into a crawl space above the ceiling. No line of site.  gt youll see a bubbleshaped preview of where youreNot so much a bubble... more like a portal like view of where you would be if you commit to the jump. You can move your hand all around you to check out the full surroundings. Cloudlands Minigolfgt After a few minutes with Cloudlands VR Minigolf we were shocked to realize we hadnt yet played a VR golf game. This sentence confused me for a minute because I read it as if they instead did something other in Cloudlands Minigolf instead of golfing... I am assuming they mean they are shocked that they had not yet seenplayed other VR golf titles. Maybe the confusion is my fault. shrugsArizona Sunshinegt resembles the events other arcadeshooter game Space Pirate Trainer and while we didnt enjoy Arizona as much...STOP IT! You shot things around you... THAT IS THE ONLY SIMILARITY... Your comparisons are painful! SPT was about dodging ducking shooting blocking waves of robots that fly up from one location and then fan out. Arizona sunshine has zombies coming at you from every angle including jumping off a cliff behind you in some cases! Arizona Sunshine is all about suspense steady aim ammo control and keeping an eye on your backside. At one point in the demo you are forced to give up one of your weapons for a flashlight after going into a zombie infested mine shaft. Meh... I like the sword play in Skyrim much more than in Minecraft...   Seethes gt We got to wield Glocks shotguns and uzis during our brief demoDisclaimer I have issue with this as a gun enthusiast not a gamer. Glock is a manufacture not a type of firearmneither is Uzi but I am far less versed on submachine guns. I saw two separate pistol models in my demo one looked a lot like a Beretta and the other like a Sig that even went as far as to put Pc on the side. Not a Glock. Watch less gangster movies... Wrap upgt adding a pair of wired headphones to the mix was trickier.  As such we will probably invest in some Bluetooth earbuds for easier Vive use when the platform launches.Bro do you even Chaperon?gt We lost connection to our headset twice during a Budget Cuts demo thanks to the cords being dislodged after theyd gotten twisted in our walkaround play and that was in spite of the games devs herding our cords around as we played to help us avoid snags.Hrmm... In my demos I had no cord minion and I never had an issue let alone one bad enough to rip the cord from the PC... I would like to attribute this to a newly found super power of mine however sadly everyone else I talked to at the event had the same experience. gt We know at least one other critic at the event very nearly fell over thanks to a wiretangling incident.O.ogt We got into the habit of kicking cords out of our way like an angry donkeyAh... now the past two sentences make sense.,Vive,czift50,14,t5_378go

6518452,0,t3_44w2er,There arent many full blown AAA games being made for any VR headset right now because VR is currently an unproven market with a negligible installed base of potential customers.No publisher outside of Oculus wants to risk an AAA level game dev budget on VR yet because that would be insane from a financial standpoint. Just way too much risk and in the short term at least not much financial upside. The most amazing VR game in the history of the universe is unlikely to move a couple million units in the next year or so because its unlikely that there will be a couple million consumers out there with VR hardware in that time frame. And AAA titles generally dont work financially unless they sell millions of copies. That being said there are a number of sim games from smaller devs that have decent VR support already even though the games generally arent built for VR from the ground up. Youre usually not looking at the full blown AAA level of art assets but they can still be quality games. Many of those games have had various levels of VR support for the Rift DK and DK and many of them will likely end up being ported to Rift CV and the Vive. ,Vive,cztk4ku,3,t5_378go

6554982,0,t1_czx9r55,The reality is that AAA studios are not going to risk a AAA budget for a VR only game while its still a new market. It would be reckless from a financial perspective. AAA games cost tens of millions of dollars to make and as such they need to sell millions of copies in order to not lose money. The installed base for consumer VR headsets is currently somewhere in the neighborhood of zero. And while its looking like its going to start increasing in a few months itll likely be a while before theres millions of people out there for you to sell a VRonly game to. The economics of the VR market will almost certainly not be able to support fullblown AAA titles for at least a few years. And then it takes a couple years to build a new AAA title from scratch. Very few companies are going to start spending AAA development money until the market gets big enough to support it. So add a couple more years before things start getting released. Im guessing itll be at least  years before we start seeing a decent amount of large scale AAA games for VR. ,Vive,czxc70f,6,t5_378go

And that means foots movements have about zero correlation with real movements.But they can use some statistical analysis to make foots movements sharper.I worked in a company developing the medical device doesntt matter what exactly that used sensors on knees and foots to make walking charts. Finally we realized one sensor on a belt allow to detect and separate left and right steps too. Ok we dont have belt sensor here just head but idea is the same. Thre are body movement patterns could be used to detect steps even including direction.

Many developers would just ignore the Vive and only develop for the Rift and even if they supported the Vive they wouldnt focus on the unique features of the Vive like room scale VR but just release a straight port.The only way that this wont become reality is to ensure that enough people are buying the Vive so that there is a marekt for Vive enabled and Vive focused games.

Admittedly Ive only had one chance with the touch controllers so I wont entirely write them off as I assume people have also had issues with the Vive controllers and hopefully didnt write them off as well. My concern is that two frontfacing cameras are not going to be useful for full  degree room scale with Oculus touch. I also found it peculiar that the play area is so small.

6756697,0,t1_d0i6n4c,It wasnt a real crash because it didnt crash the games industry. It crashed it in america. And then immediately rebounded when Japan and Europe filled the gap. To the average consume it went virtually unnoticed. As for Saturation the big problem was they were producing way more games and physical product than the market could absorb. The market being in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Stores were sending game cartridges back to the manufacturers. That cannot happen now everything is digital. As long as any given indie dev fools a few thousand people hes basically paid for his time. And even if he fails it is completely cellular.

I support the dont knock it till you try it approach to most things  including most psychoactive drugs  but that includes thorough research beforehand and cursory research in this case has revealed a lot of concerns. Id try it but under controlled conditions.EDIT Ahah uNeqsis hits on it heregtSo with that skepticism in mind lets see what a reviewer for engadget has to say after testing these headphones outgtgtIt took a lot of trial and error to get to the point where the stimulation was working and having Back in Black screaming at high volume certainly wasnt conducive to a relaxing environment. Then again when the system began to work I could certainly feel some sensation although nothing too discomforting. After about  minutes I did feel a mild sense of elation that lasted until I shut down the device and for the next five minutes I was a little spaced out.gtgtAt last years CES I helped test out Thync a wearable that was designed to calm you down or get you pumped up for a big day. Similar to that device its hard to know at first blush if the sensations that I felt were genuine or simply a byproduct of the environment. After all sitting down and listening to  minutes of music drowning out the din of a loud and busy trade show could probably make you feel similar levels of relaxation. With all of these things its impossible to say if their effective without significant testing under less chaotic conditions.gtBullshit confirmed.,Vive,d0kahj5,2,t5_378go

They hardly can be called the main source of tracking because they cant track anything without real measurements to compensate for drift.Without real measurements IMU tracking falls apart in a few milliseconds.  The rift will have  times the drift as vive.  Which is why for touch controllers they require a second camera that overlaps the first camera so they stagger their frames so that  a frame from one of the two cameras comes in every ms.  Each camera is hz but one is half a frame offset.,Vive,d0nn55z,1,t5_378go

6832977,0,t1_d0qsehl,The nd camera is I believe mostly to reduce occulsion when using the touch controllers. If youre waving your hands around with touch controllers theres a chance youll obscure the view of the headset from the camera. Having another POV reduces this possibility. I hadnt heard that they are going to stagger the frame captures but in a way it makes sense. You correct the IMU errors more often and by staggering frames you arent trying to process two images at the same time. But I believe the main issue is for occlusion. Though Im still not convinced that camera tracking is the way to go. Like you say it requires image processing which has its own computing requirements and FOVresolution becomes important.

Every example is basically encapsulated on its own not tying anything together either.I already knew the basics of C but hadnt applied object oriented design. I started with Learning C by Developing Games with UnityD  which would be a good first programming book from variables types to class inheritance.C Game Programming Cookbook for Unity D includes applied examples of state machine based games with robust object oriented design but theyre still pretty hard for me to follow at this stage. I got that one last year and got discouraged and stopped working with Unity but the Vive has me interested again and I am having a lot more success the second time around.Beginning D Game Development with Unity  Allinone multiplatform game development Technology in Action  I went through that whole book following along. Its outdated now but I definitely learned a lot from doing it.To learn from these you need to follow what they do but do you own thing.

6843119,0,t3_49i2c8,This is essentially just a different design of zero position treadmill substituting some button pressing and a less realistic walk for the big hardware.  So yes something like that is absolutely possible and being worked on.  VR chat has gamepad locomotion so you can kind of try it out for yourself right now just moving your feet on your own and pressing the buttons to get the general feel.  It helps some but I still dont think its a complete solution.Not entirely relevant but the vive will not cover a m x m area.  That would place the lighthouse stations about m apart which is beyond their recommended distance though would still probably be fine  but the bigger issue is the m cord on the headset itself.  If your computer is outside the chaperone area which it should be it wont stretch to both opposite corners and this should be trivial to realize with any level of geometry to trigonometry.,Vive,d0rz1gf,0,t5_378go

6853753,0,t1_d0skixg,gt And unlike many people having a cockpit didnt solve it for me  Eve looks unplayable for me yet Id enjoy it on a monitor. No monitor game has ever given me sickness even Mirrors Edge.For what its worth I alpha tested EVE Valkyrie and never had any discomfort. Locomotion in games makes me sim sick very quickly  Minecrift will within a minute or two.  The flight sims Ive tried will as soon as I dive.I suspect EVE Valkyrie will work just fine for a lot of folks who are vulnerable to sim sickness for three reasons Our brain is mostly trained accept that we shouldnt be feeling Gforces when piloting scifi starships. Same reason you wont feel sick if youre on the bridge of the starship Enterprise and see the ship go to warp via the main viewscreen. The cockpit effect is real and some implementations are especially effective.  Take the Vox Machinae demo  youre inside a walking mech not much different than Minecrift which makes me immediately feel bad. But they implemented it in a way in which I could move freely and even jumpjet through the air without feeling bad at least within in the  minute demo  and I believe if I can last that long without feeling anything I can probably acclimate longer term. Different games are able to tweak the presence vs sim sickness slider.  Note that this is separate from immersion. In EVE Valkyrie I feel incredibly immersed and its super engaging  you cant play it on a monitor its not nearly the same.  But I dont feel as much presence as I do in some other flight games including space flight. I believe that contributes to a significant risk of sim sickness.  Ive heard others say the same thing  that EVE Valkyrie still seems D but somehow seems a bit less presence inducingintense than some other games but no less fun.Another comparison would be Richard Burns Rally vs Dirt Rally. In RBR sometimes I have to pinch myself with how real it feels how much like actually being sitting in a rally car. They have a part of the training session where after you learn to do all the training routes they have Richard Burns drive with you in the passenger seat to show you how its done properly. And my god that experience is emblazoned in my memory like I was the passenger in a real rally car.The downside? I get sick almost as soon as I hit any bumps on the side of the road. Its terrible and I basically cant play unless I can drive without ever making an error.  On the other hand Dirt Rally.  Still super immersive but the sense of being in a totally different physical place is reduced. Still there but less intense. For months I didnt buy Dirt Rally figuring itd be the same experience.  But eventually I couldnt resist anymore and I bought it prepared to return it within  hours.  Ends up in Dirt Rally I can do hairpins hit bumps crash etc. without feeling sim sick.  Yet the sense of speed blasting through some of the routes is still amazing.  I play both combined with FF wheel amp pedals.So my suggestion would be not to write off games particularly cockpit ones on the assumption that theyll make you sick. Give them a try if they have a demo or you otherwise can without committing and you may find some are totally playable and a lot of fun.,Vive,d0t6j5q,2,t5_378go

6916732,0,t1_d108owx,I guess I was operating under the assumption that limiting artificial movement purely to forward translation movement and probably fairly slow movement at that would reduce a lot of the motion sickness but perhaps Im wrong. I really just need to finally get my Vive so I can actually experiment with this stuff!Personally Im thinking of a hybrid system where you have physical walking for highprecision smallscale movement limited teleportation for midrange precision movement and artificial forward translational movement for largescale movement.The teleportation would be restricted to make it less immersion breaking in particular you wouldnt be able to teleport very far in any direction including up and down. Might even not allow you to teleport within your roomscale play space as well to make sure people are encouraged to blend all three methods together.This would be less of a Minecraft port and more of an entirely new game built purely for roomscale VR.UpdateAlso by the way for the artificial forward movement you could allow the player to use tunnelling They can configure the size of the tunnel according to their personal tolerance. I think that this combination of techniques could actually completely eliminate motion sickness for most people and tunnelling wouldnt be so annoying since you wouldnt be relying on that sort of artificial movement .,Vive,d10c24n,2,t5_378go

Unlike SLI where you have to worry about profile bits soso scaling SLI compatible engine and all that you have a fairly straight forward solution of oneeyepercard. So in theory multiGPU setups are more relevant than ever before with a much bigger return on the investment. Only downside is right now developers have to specifically implement them will they be able to implement both given Nvidias track record of blocking out the opposition with fancy contracts? Then you have DirectX  that allows much lower level access for the developers maybe that will allow them to natively implement this tech without having to rely on separate API implementation.Lots of untapped potential that few seem to talk about. ,Vive,d10n6rb,16,t5_378go

6977892,0,t3_4b7zuu,gt Ive been hearing from a smattering of people that insist that Rift can do room scale exactly as well as the Vive once Touch releases. That theres no difference in the quality of the tracking.There is absolutely NO evidence Ive seen and believe me Ive looked that this is actually true. Oculus claims they can do roomscale with touch or more specifically with the second camera it includes but they have not demonstrated the ability to do it. Im not saying its definitely not true and I hope it is true as competition is what VR needs in the early stages but at present theres nothing to say this is anything more than a rumor or wishful thinking.Also the no difference in the quality of tracking is definitely false. In most situations the difference likely wont be noticeable but Lighthouse tracking is without question objectively superior especially for roomscale where you need a larger FOV on the tracking device.,Vive,d17a674,1,t5_378go
6978097,0,t3_4b94r1,Its not even about roomscale its just about having the combination of the lowest tracking latency highest tracking accuracy and highest tracking reliability. I could give up walking but I absolutely will not compromise on tracking.The fact that taking a step in VR promotes immersion in a big way is just a bonus. Thats what people dont get  the hand tracking is mandatory. Without the hand tracking its just a fancy display.I had tried both dev kits and the gearVR I was going to buy a Rift.

They said the only reason they did not do this as soon as you pre ordered the device was because putting a hold a month out was just not possible but since there are so many preorders they want to make sure those who have ordered and have the funds available will be the first to get these devices.I know many of you will say The HTC reps have no clue what they are talking about and while that may be true hearing two reps tell me pretty close to the same thing makes me think there is a good chance there is something to what Ive been told.

That goes double for the Xbox One controller.  Who doesnt already have an Xbox  pad or equivalent Steam controller etc?The Vive feels like a complete VR setup built with the PC gamer in mind.  Rift feels rushed just to be the first HMD released by a week or so.  I lurked rOculus for a long time and Palmer Luckey has had to backtrack on like  of everything hes said.  Valve are industry vets and I feel like Oculus got a lot more valuable information out of Valve in their short collaboration than viceversa.  Which is why HTCValve have the superior experience ready to go sooner while the Rift is still NDA heavy especially on Touch.Id prefer it wasnt a competition but regardless Vive clearly wins round one.

7005161,0,t1_d1a9dl0,You dont understand the technical implications here. Firstly noone gave Valve permission to use the Oculus SDK they dont need it. They implemented the Oculus SDK into their OpenVR API. Now Oculus could very well implement the OpenVR API into their store but they dont want to so because then anyone with any rubbish hardware could run their applications. The only other alternative is to implement the Vives SDK in their store which requires Valves cooperation because the Vive SDK ties directly into Steam. Now the new sticking point here is that Valve want Vive games in the storefront to launch Steam to work. This would harm Oculus because Vive users on their store would be directed away from their store which is the only way they make profit. This latest issue needs to be resolved before anything else can go forward.N.B the last points re launching Steam are based on semireliable rumour.,Vive,d1ado77,-4,t5_378go

7026106,0,t1_d1cnwi5,I counter pretty much all your analogy now why would you turn randomly when there is a door or just some random distance happen to be your chaperone size? No not initially.A person build its space awareness by associate his movement link to access to specific purpose. Thats why you can wake up at night go to pee without turning on light its not visual feedback its how your body remembers it to do this step and even if you cant see just by hand bump into familiar objectswalldoordoor knobetc then you know exactly where you are.This locomotion system have  major flaw.. It would take extra long time to build space awareness of how the level constructed in your brain cause your motionconstant turning around confuse with past experience to build where you need to go back and forth. It would require really deliberate level prop layout to use it as visual guide to identify yourself in relation to that space. You basically remember things like how you remember D RPG room maze by mapping it differently compare to how you map real world relation say your place or your schooloffice.. By constantly movingturning around you build muscle memory. Depending on how long you use it and how old you are there would be a disconnect one you take off your HMD and back to real life. Cause the game environment is mimic real life scale things things you familiar. Doors hall ways rooms windows etc. If its a fantasy setting like Windland or Fantastic Contraption its less an issue cause there are no relationship to your real world counter part. But a locomotion system in life simulation situation could potentially build an illusion that you almost hit the boundary why isnt that grid wall show up in your brain by how far and how frequent you have do such thing in repetition.Now no flight simulator can sim a fighter jet dog fight properly why spending money build multi million cockpit to train pilots? Even simpler ones like F have their special build simulator. It all build to train your muscle memory through repeating situation and resolution. So when actual things happened it might not feel exactly the same to your brain but your brain could auto pilot most of the partslocate buttons how much break to apply etc instead of panic and into deer in headlights mode.And in this game we simulate walking as if its real life but with a not so minor twist.edit formatting,Vive,d1crgay,0,t5_378go

7077417,0,t1_d1ijb7z,Nah man you can still post negative things as long as it doesnt bait anyone or start drama. PI understand they have new mods but as someone who has moderated somewhat popular gaming subreddits before they are going about this all the wrong ways and this is definitely a kneejerk reaction. Just because you have a few people complaining doesnt mean you need to go start making rules that limit discussion. Here a mod implies that the Linknewtab posts would have been fine had they been presented in a different way. Im calling bullshit on that right now. I dont care how you present the facts that Linknewtab did. You would always have the fanboys crying foul and bitching about what was being said. In fact I would argue that the way Linknewtab posted information was very civil. It was the other users unwilling to believe that created the issue.Thats part of the issue with this new rule. This rule is so subjective and powerfeeding to the mods. Anytime shit stirs up in the comments the mods can just claim the OP must have been baiting and shut it down. Even though the post is civil and its intentions were to just share information. I fear the way the community reacts to things will dictate how the mods perceive a particular post. Its a slippery slope to go down.Above all of that this rule is already governed by a system that is redditwide in the post voting system. If there is a post that is baiting or dramainducing chances are it will get downvoted. The only time you would want to take it to such an extreme that the mods would dictate what gets removed or not is when you have a voting bot or a bunch of trolls upvoting such content. In which case you get Reddit Admin involved with their new votemanipulation rules.Im not surprised one bit though. Seen it before will see it again.

It may do a few millimetres in build depth though and a thinner HMD is a HMD with less leverage to its mass. The probably more important pro is that you can tune the focal length of each ring to the travel distance from it to the display panel ...which increases the farther from the centre you go as you come in at an ever more oblique angle. You could do the same with a regular lens but due to the longer travel distances through the lens itself I surmise that may be more sensive to your pupil moving away from the lens centre warping the image more noticeably EDIT ...when you look around by swivelling your eyeballs.EDIT ...and the reason youd to that tuning is to get more of your view in focus. In my old Rift DK for instance only a rather small spot in the centre is sharp to my vision and the farther out to the periphery I look the more blurry things are.,Vive,d1jq8ej,5,t5_378go

Oculus annoyed me with their whole ordering process no way postorder to link account to order e.g.My assumption was Rift would come first Id have fun then the more capable Vive would ship and expand things further.  If the more capable unit is going to come first then I probably will just cancel the Rift order.  Yeah I could afford both but one of the RIfts key advantages was my assumption it would get here months sooner so without that its much more meh and  for meh isnt worth it.,Vive,d1kpptw,2,t5_378go

7101345,0,t3_4ct5m1,Vive does everything Rift can do and a lot of things it cant. At present there appear to be no advantages to the Rift other than exclusive content and slightly higher pixel fill at a cost of slightly lower FOV its an even trade against Vive and not really a noticeable difference by most accounts anywayWhen Touch comes out the two systems will be a bit more competitive but at present outside of price and exclusive content there doesnt really seem to be any good objective reason to prefer the Rift. Ive seen plenty of subjective ones people who believe in Palmers vision and want to continue to support it stuff like that but objectively it seems price is all they have going for them.I realize that may sound biased as fuck but Im just calling it how I see it.

If Steamworks friends arent compatible with Oculus Home friends Im not really sure how you can blame Oculus.Is nobody allowed to have their own store now that Valve has a friends list? No its up to the developers to integrate steamworks in a way that can be used crosssystem. Its not even hard but it is more work if you didnt expect to ever need it.We also have to remember. Steam is a general purpose gaming store. It always has been and thats not changing. Oculus doesnt have that power so they have to try to find a niche if they want to survive. Theres is that content must support OculusSDK. I dont think thats particularly unreasonable.Now there is an issue with the compatibility of OculusSDK gt SteamVR. And I still dont know who to blame. Im all ready to blame Oculus. But this concept that a new store has to ensure it has Steam integration is silly.Disclaimer Im buying both.,Vive,d1mkjnm,43,t5_378go

He gave me a special link they have set this up specially for this very problem to reorder and assured me that it would take the same place in the queue as I already had.

7114837,0,t3_4d0qm7,Hello Im in the UK had preordered my Vive in the first few minutes and Ive been contacting my bank about this. I had preauthorised the charge weeks in advance and AGAIN when a fraud alert came out on Friday.At the moment I called they were dealing with multiple people at that moment with vive order problems. Its an epic screwup.  They told me what seems to have happened is a combination of errors by Digital River an Irish payments company. Digital river submitted a huge number of high value transactions at the same time and unsurprisingly it generated blocks on every account automatically with manyall of the banks concerned.In this situation digital river should have contacted the banks in advance BEFORE putting a huge number of charges through and not doing it on a Friday would have wise too.Digital river have then compounded the error bya not attempting to charge the cards again laterb Issuing problem and cancellation messages at AM and AM on a Saturday while everyone is asleep and a full day after their foolish charge attemptc Not having customer support available on a SaturdaySundayd Generating fraudulent order cancellation claims. If you look youll see that digital rivers site claims YOU cancelled your own order. e Not communicating with customers or HTCand HTC have failed by choosing a crappy payments provider and not being immediately in touch with customers to try to sort this out. ,Vive,d1mv65k,18,t5_378go

7136589,0,t3_4db5n8,Heres what a lot of people are kind of missing when thinking about the Vive or Rift and whos buying which ...these devices currently target core PC enthusiast gamers.  Im not going to say PC Master race gamers ...although I personally think they are also part of this group but rather say the kind of person willing to spend something close to  USD just on their PC video card. No matter how you spin it thats a special breed of gamer ...thats just not everyone.Now the kind of PC gamer that buys a high end video card and thinks thats real good value does their research.  They read all the reviews and they are quite likely to post on Reddit.  The mass market doesnt but the mass market isnt buying the Rift or the Vive they are the ones saying its too expensive or might buy PSVR.As far as this target audience Oculus has really dropped the ball.  They pushed exclusives that make them feel like a console company and their hardware a console platform consoles tend to have a really bad stigma amongst this crowd and Oculus even has two consolelike exclusive games offered for free to Rift users Luckys Tale and underage console like platformer and EveValkeryie  a consolelike arcade space shooter with watered down game mechanics and microtransactions  Both games are not bad per se to this audience because they are consolelike although that doesnt help but that they offer nothing new in terms of game mechanics.Compare that now to the HTC Vive that is an open system with a a favorable hardware pro vs con list.  It shows positively in trusted reviews and the kinds of experiences it is pushing are novel such as Space Pirate Trainer.  These kind of experiences mean a lot to the group Im describing as they are hardened gamers with some serious game fatigue that are tired of the same Call of Duty game or even dismiss something as gorgeous as Starwars Battlefront for being shallow with little depth.  This is an audience starving for new experiences.The Rift and the Vive are both excellent well engineered HMDs but given the target audience I think the Vive wont just be  its going to well overtake the Rift.  Oculus only real chance is to branch into a different target audience.,Vive,d1pcor0,24,t5_378go

7145005,0,t1_d1qae9p,Yup it was always obvious any primary game store would have an uphill nearimpossible battle against Steam. Steam is what almost everyone will use by default if not given a major reason to use something else. I personally have sometimes paid slightly more for games for the convenience of having them on Steam. Attempting to surmount that is exactly the reason for some of Oculus less popular decisions. Even between Steam and a storeecosystem equally as good with the exact same features most would choose Steam because thats where their existing game library is.

This is mainly just an equipment upgrade for me because Im currently using a headset that is made of d printed parts a raspberry pi screen and using vuforia for tracking. I have access to our lab equipment but were limited in how much we have and its mostly OSVR stuff Razer Hydras and Oculus Rift DKs. Id like to experiment more with roomscale ability and the Vives controllers as I havent had a chance to personally experience either. The Hydra was the closest representation I could get and they are limited in their ability and somewhat shaky at times due to the how they track. magnetic field What little I could do with them though felt amazing.

7161384,0,t1_d1s2q80,There was a report in one of the CC declined threads that an HTC rep warned that CC orders changed to PayPal would need to be a new order and treated as one to the back of the line. Keep in mind that a lot of what reps have said turned out to be not quite in line with how Digital River ended up handling things. Saying wed be recharged within  hours  only to have orders cancelled shipping for those recharged  or  which I havent seen any reports of or not losing our spot in line which we all seem to be. I think HTC really wants to do these things theyre saying but DR doesnt seem to be following suit on anything. The only thing weve been seeing strong evidence of is that anything concerning HTC reps updating payment methods has negatively impacted ship times.

A Ferrari will generally do  mph but do critics complain that its a shortcoming of the car when you drive it on roads with a  mph speed limit?At least you have the option with a Vive. If you dont have the room how is that HTCs or Valves fault? If you move to a new place with more room you can use a feature.Providing you with features that are inherent to the design and free doesnt even cost you anything extra if you dont use them.

Next to the Whale encounter there is a beautiful scenery with lots of fish turtles and all kinds of underwater plants that you can slightly interact with. Its a great way to show of VR though this demo actually manages to make my framerate dip significantly when I look at a spot full of  plants and many particle effects.  i k GB Ram here so of course below the minimum specs with my GPU but I hope they will optimise for lower end hardware in the future.The real highlight is the third one Luminous Abyss. I actually dont want to spoil you anything so if you have the cash and think about buying it just go for it. Super atmospheric simply brilliant. And I say that as someone who was underwhelmed by the Whale Encounter.

With  monitors and a th the vive being constantly activated and deactivated I wouldnt be surprised for windows to start freaking out.

I was flying planet side staying as low as possible to avoid most of his shots and to cause his missle to lose lock or to crash into the ground. I had no shields to make room for more cargo every shot he landed any collision with the surface and any missles that made it would actually do some serious long term damage. I got out of my ship and started running towards the edge of this cliff. When I reached the cliffs edge I heard my ship explode behind me and saw its bits and pieces fly around me as I jumped off the edge. I thought I would get hurt from the fall but it was a low gravity world so me and my ships wreckage seemed to float down in slow motion.

7228697,0,t1_d1z9j7t,gt but that shit sucks for any VR fan to deal with.Im happy it turned out this way. No not because of some petty comeuppance but because Facebook leading VR would have been disasterous. Their exclusive deals and their downplaying of roomscale and motion controllers is inexcusable. They were turning the dream of VR into just strap a HMD on your face and play some seated thirdperson platformers and space games. VR is so much more than that! Having Oculus take a backseat is best for the industry. Their brief leadership position was inexcusably terrible.,Vive,d1zuko0,5,t5_378go

Since when is more money put into something making it better and at a higher value by default? They know how well the movie can sell because its an established market and they have the money to spend to make it look more appealing to the masses according to them.

7233228,0,t3_4eiavz,One big difference is that pretty much all Vive games are made for the Vive touch controllers. Some devs are just starting to create for the Oculus touch. It might be a while before there are a lot of room scale games for the Oculus. ,Vive,d20d5p2,3,t5_378go
7233704,0,t3_4eiavz,Ultimately it is your call but Id highlight a couple of things.  First the Rift wont be out for current preorders until much later than your Vive preorder so you are looking at a major delay.  Second keep in mind the touch controllers are going to have an unknown additional cost and still likely wont have  degree capability you cant turn around.  They have no chaperone system and no front facing camera making it a far less refined than the Vive.  The third point is the whole refined thing.  There isnt really a difference in how refined the two platforms are for stationary and for room scale Vive has a substantial advantage in refinement.  The only real arguable refined advantage to the Rift is the very slight weight difference and the integrated headphones however integrated headphones are only as good as the headphones they include and the weight difference is inconsequential when worn correctly.,Vive,d20f3wq,1,t5_378go

I have that exact HDMI cable pack. Bought it in preparation for my rift sim setup a few months ago. Ive tried those extenders with the vive at home and they produce snow artifacts on the image with just one of the two extenders. Its not horrible but you notice in on dark images. Ive used a  foot display port cable to extend the vive without any issues. In fact it was a cheap monoprice minidp to dp cable. So if youre looking to extend go that route instead. Edit  Heres a link to the display port cables  They also have a ft version of that cable but I cant comment if it would work as I only have the ft and ft versions.,Vive,d20ioiq,7,t5_378go

I want to be able to sidestep a combat opponent without having to take my eyes off them.Controls for VR games just generally feel very clunky to me. I dont see there being any competitive multiplayer shooters or RPGs that use roomscale anytime soon. Theres just not enough fine control.I dont experience VR nausea personally. Its akin to riding in a car to me. But I understand some people do. Id say make teleportation an option but its such a big gamechanger and would be especially problematic in a multiplayer game.

It does not take very much imagination to come up with reasons why they might not be able or interested.More insightI dont know all the details and its mostly hearsay from other studios were collaborating with but it sounded like Valve wanted a fullon Steam layer on top of the Oculus SDK a bit like Ubisoft does it with Uplay on Steam but just when using the Vive and not on a gamebygame basis but Oculus wasnt too happy with that. There is also a bit of pressure by Valve to ditch the OVR SDK completely and use OpenVR for all PC builds but that would mean we wouldnt be able to use the Oculus Store and would have to miss out on visibility and profit.,Vive,d21mo5d,1,t5_378go

Of course thats my opinion.So no for me a good game is not judged by the criteria you give me but much more by what it make me feelgo through from what I learn of it how it affects me also and how the games universe has a hold on me.Not sure if it was clear enough but I hope you get my point. ,Vive,d22d7hx,2,t5_378go

Users should expect that hacked games wont work indefinitely as regular software updates to games apps and our platform are likely to break hacked software.    We dont condone it meaning they cant support it the hack. That doesnt mean youll be punished in some way. It just means if a game or the Oculus SDK gets an update that breaks this hack youll have to wait for the hack creator to update it because Oculus arent going to patch their SDK and game developers arent going to patch their games based around a rd party hack nor should anyone expect them to.,Vive,d23gszs,2,t5_378go
7260718,0,t1_d22runc,Touch has  trigger  stick and  buttons per hand how is it more? not counting menu. Also  sticks? How second will be used to move camera? Thats sick. Theyre equal  what you should go for is ability to roomscale not gonna believe usb extenders where there are SO MANY chipsets not compatible because of bandwidth shortage those cameras are sending full video feed with IR filter. Also ability to read text is the same people wear Vive wrong there were posts about that. Not to mention playing Oculus exclusives via hacks while they cannot do that opposite way without Touch. Comfort is worse but still comfortable it gets to be seen as bad because of comparisons. The real deal breaker is platform  while Touch arrives in this year I cant imagine that Oculus Home will be with even half of Steams features in that timeframe. Oculus Home has ultra bad friends list no invites to game with Video you cant even put a path to your files not to mention things like scrolling with scrollbar come on its VR no user reviews store pages filled with crap screenshots not even able to set app requirements thats why you have to buy Virtual Desktop from Steam no refunds I can go for hours. Think in bigger picture lets say StarVR or anything new will hit the market in few years and you will jump ship  Steam will support it as its supporting Rift and they want to support everything while your purchases in Home are closed and usable only by Rift. Refunds are also more needed because of motion sickness inducing issues per game.,Vive,d23hqlt,1,t5_378go

7262423,0,t3_4ev9wh, Douglas wife does ulitmately as far as I know. The problem with adaptions of HG is that very same depth and richness The twisted logic behind the crazy stuff how that is explained and presented and how it is often analogous to inaneifyouthinkaboutitbutuniversallyacceptednormality from the real world which was amply proved by that unfortunate Disney big screen production which was all ooh its so wacky! surface and saved only by the moments when the action came to a halt for an excerpt from the guide. It could certainly be done though in the hands of the right producer. The big difficulty lies in making it an experience in its own right as opposed to something that just rehashes scenes from the original story in any of its revisions whilst retaining the authors fingerprints. We no longer have the benefit of Douglas own input alas like the Infocom text adventure did. Actually the adventure might have been a good starting point old enough to be new to young audiences if it wasnt so reliant on the nature of the medium written word...,Vive,d23oq27,2,t5_378go

7292222,0,t1_d26xhjt,Thats why Sonys going the PSVR route. Most console gamers have a PS so that wont represent too large of a barrier to entry for them. The hardwares not up to PC snuff but when youre developing for a single set of hardware specs that are as well understood as the PSs are you can maximize your bang for your development buck. Once Sony pulls in the console crowd theyll inevitably try out the Vive or Oculus or whatever other Gen  hardware comes out by that point and then things will get really interesting. Right now these hardware companies have to educate an entire population on a watershed in display technology that has been DoA in the past. Thats where we come in simply by telling our friends and families about it and letting them check it out for themselves. Word of mouth and letting people try out our Vives are whats going to really sell this tech not some flashy marketing campaign by FB or HTC or Steam or Sony. ,Vive,d272rql,4,t5_378go

One of them is definitely fairly flimsy however putting the lighthouse flat on the floor or turning either of them completely off seems to have no effect on the jitteryness. Its pretty noticeable while wearing the HMD. You know that feeling when youve been on a boat all day and then get on land and you feel phantom waves under you feet?

7301641,0,t1_d284opt,They already have that.  Each base station sends out blinks to synchronize the system.  All sensors see a blink then wait for the sweep to come around.  The length of time tells that sensor exactly where it is along that sweep.  The time difference between two points on that device tells it how close it is to the station and the order of the points tells the object what orientation it is in.Now the blinks happen at Hz and the sweep motors are at Hz.  Why are the motors half the speed?  Because the order of blink to sweeps is as such B  Base station  and B  Base station Blink B x sweep blink B y sweep blink B x sweep blink B y sweep repeatThe blinks synchronize everybody.  When B is sweeping Bs lasers are off on their sweep so they dont interfere and vice versa.  If you add a third each base station has to wait longer for its next turn while the other two go.  The problem gets worse as you add more.Either they can increase the speed of the Lighthouse motors with the potential issues it brings or they make each station wait longer between its sweeps.  If you dont do one of those you get overlapping sweeps and breakdown tracking.,Vive,d285az8,-1,t5_378go

It was still declined.I received an email from HTC last night with some guidance but it was all a wash. They state that PayPal is an acceptable alternative but they dont tell you that it resets you in the queue if you follow that route.Ultimately what I had to do was cancel my order and resubmit with the HTC rep on the line and then immediately conference in a Wells Fargo rep to authorize and it finally went through. ,Vive,d28vhef,2,t5_378go

7321974,0,t1_d2ad2ki,gt I have both the only thing that will make me keep the Vive are games that dont work with touch.That I believe is the fatal flaw with Oculus release.By not packing the controllers with the Rift theyve already segmented their user base. Developers now must choose between making games for touch vs conventional controllers. If they want to sell more games theyll mostlikely lean towards making controllerKBM games rather than utilizing the Rifts touch controllers because its guaranteed to be compatible with EVERY Rift HMD. Where as with the Vive devs dont need to make that choice at all. If your draw to a platform is immersion your best bet is with the Vive at least for now. Who knows though. Perhaps once the motion controllers for the Rift are released Oculus could send them out for free to early adopters. Once thats done pack them in with every new Rift sold from then on. That would almost certainly solidify the Rifts victory.Itd be an immense profit loss in the beginning but it would buy the user base over essentially locking in the longterm win.,Vive,d2agi5a,2,t5_378go

7331808,0,t1_d2bhhu3,gt But the main appeal of the Vive is not first and foremost to fool your brain into thinking you actually are somewhere else.But it is ! In part . Not consiously. But when people are blown away and talk about immersion and loosing track of time  putting controllers on VR tables this is what they are talking about. The headtracking and D effect  scale gives part of you a feeling of being in another space. That is the biggest feature of VR. Looking at gt The visual part I would say is a supportingHighly doubtful for non developers. People arent taken back by the Blu demo because of the ability to walk around and swat at fish. The core that carries the whole experience is that the visuals are working to create a good d setting . Social VR is a thing because people actually feel social presence in it . Because of the depth. This is what Im saying is not working well for me . gt The optics are better than the Rift as most measurements indicateSo we have a fanboy on our hands then. Becasue this is the opposite of what the majority of reporters have said outside if rvive . And no Im not getting a rift or think it is a major improvement in any way. gt But the Vive is about the room and the controls and what you can do with it. If you dont get that then maybe you should sell it on eBay to someone who does.Not sure what get that is but I understand the concept far beyond necessity. But If the troubles with the vision percists and I dont get used to it I will. I counsciously try to have a good time in the vive and have tried every setting but its not working. That isnt my fault. ,Vive,d2bkrd3,0,t5_378go

Antialiasing more or less helps eliminate this problem. It just feels as if the Vive or SteamVR or OpenVR or whatever could be doing a little more with its antialiasing. I felt like the Rift handled this better. I think that I saw far fewer sparkles and crawlies in my . hours with the Rift CV. But I havent been able to compare them back to back.It would be nice if we had a few settings we could tweak to taste or to GPU power. Something to play with to tailor the image a bit...,Vive,d2bq0a8,3,t5_378go
7333135,1,t1_d2bp0rc,We have no idea what the final motion control for the rift will look like. The few developers who are talking about making rift motion games are saying they are doing  degree experiences only. So the two wont be comparable unless it launches with  on day one.  The rift also doesnt have a camera so no chaperone.  This might make roomscale games a PITA and make them never catch on as people will be afraid they will hurt themselves.I see the rift as continuing to be the leader in seated experiences even after their motion controls launch which of course will be somewhere around  and will turn off many potential buyers who have already paid  for the rift. Devs wont make motionroom only games considering how small a percentage of rift owners actually have this equipment.I think the vive will be wearing the roomscale crown for quite some time.,Vive,d2bq6rm,7,t5_378go

As that one controller stops tracking the other one and the HMD will continue tracking perfectly.Ill see what else could be causing interference but outside of my router which I cant move and cant leave turned off... though I did turn it off temporarily to try to troubleshoot I dont know what it could be.

7420723,0,t1_d2loi9q,Depends on what kind of equipment. Desktops with spinning drives youre probably going to end up with some broken drives if youre rough moving it around. Desktops with solid state drives you might still have problems with CPU coolers damaging motherboards various static electricity problems killing things etc.Past all of that on the Vive side you have risks like spreading diseases if you dont have a face gasketetc. You can assume that people understand these risks or spell out the liability in papers to sign. Microsoft stores spell it out Gamestop stores do not. Your HMD could be damaged through static electricity or mishandling. Someone throwing it off their head if they get scared. Someone throwing a controller playing games.Id use light stands for the most portable setup. Theres risk there too. What if someone trips and injures themselves on a lightstand. Or if theyre ok but the lighthouses break? You could mitigate some of these risks through equipment insurance andor event insurance. Or just be really really careful.You could just roll the dice will all of these risks most people would say its probably not worth the time to worry.

7430025,0,t1_d2dr65d,following uphad another chat support session with HTC was advised to update firmware of the headset. process included directconnecting hte headset closing all steamvr apps some key combination ctrlhome? to open a window that would permit forcing the firmware update. I ran this a few times at the suggestion of the tech but had to disconnect eventually to restart.Unfortunately the firmware updates always failed at the point of camera drivers install. Upon restart I got a headset not connected properly message further indicating an issue with the HDMI connection. Ive tried a number of disconnectreconnectuninstallreinstall cycles. Ive also tried connecting and installing on other PCs the all dont recognize the HDMI connection. Additionally the camera no longer shows up under usb settings or in windows device manager. Ive been busy this week and had tried to start a chat session with HTC but they seem to have not agents available.In short if youre having the problems Ive been having I recommend against HTCs firmware update method until theyve got a better handle on this issue.

7459790,0,t1_d2q2o3v,Yeah you have to really use your available info and stats when determining if youre going to lose money.  I mean theoretically you could price your game at  and if you decide to lower it to  youre not missing out on  since no one presumably bought it at that price.  Its trickier when the numbers arent exaggerated like in this instance but there are definitely sweet spots.Knowing what your genre is what the expectations of the platform youre selling the game on are what similar games are priced etc all play big factors.  A lot of people could EASILY afford to buy Hover Junkers for example at  but as I saw in my thread many simply think its too high regardless of whether they can afford it or not.  Youve got to price to sell which is determined  by the market not by how much work you put into it or anything like that.  I imagine thats hard for a lot of developers these projects can be very personal and feel like a part of you so you kind of feel like youre cheapening all the hard work you put in but then if you see really increased sales that feeling tends to ebb away and youve built a reputation that can sale future games!,Vive,d2q4qzy,3,t5_378go

7477439,0,t3_4hrqul,Cant get it to open in VR. Just showing up as a window on my desktop. Any idea what Im doing wrong?EDIT Added nonsteam game opened through steam and it worked. Not sure if thats how its supposed to work.So... I did just enough to give some basic feedback I definitely liked the game. I might come off like a dick but I promise its only because I find criticism more useful than praise.. Sound I got no sound whatsoever not sure if that has anything to do with me or if there was none. Ive read some of the other posts and like everyone said you need D audio clues to know where stuff is coming from. also when you shoot a missile not as important and background music. Even if its just placeholder music like from   it will feel a lot better and help to fit how YOU want the game to feel do you want it to feel super intense or do you want people to chill out in your game for a while?. brand your game. Right now its very similar to Xortex. Theyre both obviously different games but especially if you plan to sell this you need a reason to sell people on it over a very polished fun free game by a popular developer. It doesnt need to be big but you need either a unique art style some sort of narrative to keep you invested in it a different play mechanic even just needing to use both hands works! or a good community. Even better if you can get multiple or all of these things.. Depth. Right now your game is VERY tracked. This isnt a problem in the new world of VR most games are pretty dimensional and are still good but adding complexity can really make your game stand out. Think instead of the missiles and planet interfering being a bug maybe you fire from the planet and that affects how the missile travels. Or maybe you have the moon orbiting the earth and if an asteroid happens to hit the moon you lose it but not the game. Maybe you have an actual civilization on the planet that youre trying to save Im reminded of The Rose and I where theres a tiny person on a comically small planet and they react to what you do cheer when you blow up an asteroid scream when you move the planet gasp when an asteroid misses them...All right Im done numbering stuff since I just ramble anyways but heres some more ideasWhile having to constantly watch  for stuff is more immersive than say Xortex its also EXTREMELY hectic.Maybe have fewer possibilities of where asteroids can come from just have them all around. maybe a couple asteroid belts out past your play area?While being in the vastness of space is perfect for this kind of game you could get just a little more wow out of it and give people a way of identifying where the asteroids are by putting the game in a location. Im thinking you just make it be a big model of the solar system that way one direction is towards the sun and you can keep track of where you are with respect to that. You could also have the other planets off in the distance as more interesting visuals or you could use them as gameplay elements if their gravity affected the asteroids.asteroids shouldnt necessarily aim directly at the earth just in the vicinity. If everything is just going at a straight line at the earth theoretically all you have to do is fire from inside the earth and fire at where the asteroid is currently at. If its not headed straight at the earth but gravity is pulling it then you have to lead your shots. it becomes more skill of shooting and aiming than of finding asteroids.You also get the added bonus of sweet looking parabolic shaped paths even better if you take other peoples suggestions and add paths to the asteroids.Slow down the asteroids. The first  or four asteroids should be super easy. They should effectively be a tutorial for new players and a way to ease back in for someone who hasnt played recently. Then you can vary the speeds or add more frequent treats. This is more of a personal preference but I think it is much better gameplay if you have to worry about being overwhelmed than just being too slow. Also an important thing to consider is that while we have chaperone we definitely dont know whats around us and having to react really quickly to each threat will involve more accidents than moving strategically to a lot of threats.All right Ive beaten you up enough thanks for the experience and I hope I helped at least a little.Keep being awesome and Ill keep testing if youd like.,Vive,d2s54gy,1,t5_378go
7477660,0,t1_d2rvsxn,I use to go with green HUD elements for readability.  Other than that might have to wait until FD fixes the Vive resolution issues.  Im actually playing Elite back on my DK as its smoother due to the ATW.  Ive got the Vive setup in the living room.When I tried the Vive I didnt think the resolution was that bad.  It looked better than the DK to me.  Theres some talk on the forums that launching through Steam as oppose to the Frontier launcher yields worse resolution.  Other people said it made no difference so YMMV.  Ive always launched with the Frontier launcher so that may be why the Vive resolution didnt bother me or because I was use to the worse resolution of the DK.,Vive,d2s60zf,1,t5_378go

I can make a FedEx account to track known tracking numbers and packages but I get an error every time I sign up for FDM using my credentials.

7482440,0,t1_d2scsrx,This may not be what you are looking for I only received my Vive yesterday afternoon. My Samsung Gear VR was my only experience with VR before my Vive and i used the GearVR for a day and put it aside never to pick it up again. It was noveltyI had a pain with the setup. I didnt mount the sensors enough so they were shaking my screen at first. Then I had an issue where my . usb wasnt playing nice and I had to switch to . to resolve the issue. I also had to track down some headphones cause the in ear ones always fall out for me in general. Finally I needed to run to the store and pick up a mini display port to display port cord since i ran out of HDMI slots on my GPU. Setup for me was a crazy  hours. i was mad. I was no longer excited. I was regretting my purchase at the moment.I preloaded  worth of games. My wife and kids tried out the Valve Lab demo for a couple hours. We all laughed and were amazed yada yada. Still i was also wondering is this a Gimmick? Is this a Wii situation here? Little family fun and then shut it off for some serious gaming.But then i loaded up the first game a simple cheesy minecraft looking base shooter game called out of ammo. This game is so sad it doesnt even really have an end. You fight waves of enemies attacking your base until your people die. It was getting late so i said ill try it for  minutes and then test one of my other  games. I played that damn game for  hours! Non stop. It was the most freaking fun Ive ever had playing any game ever! I mean i am  years old i remember playing Nintendo for the first time and being blown away at my rich friends house. This is that. The feelings I got last night were literally the same feelings I felt playing Mario on Nintendo in . Such a simple game pulling you in experiencing the new! The rush of adrenaline when a soldier runs right up to your face and you actually fear for your safety for just a moment. The satisfaction of looking over a group of soldiers as they fly everywhere from you airstrike. I found my self on one knee reaching for ammo closing one eye to aim down the rifle. I could almost feel the cold breeze lifting up from the snow the cheezy square faced soldier next to me that I wouldnt even think twice of in D became a comrade a fellow solider pinned down.  I CAN NOT wait to get home scarf down a snack and jump back into any of these little worlds. Like when Andrew got the first Nintendo in the neighborhood...and I could not focus all day because I knew after school it was on. That is as far from Gimmick as I could ever imagine my friend. And the crazy thought is that it will only get better! Order one! ,Vive,d2spmmv,7,t5_378go

7482680,0,t3_4huavo, In fact I no longer feel aware that I was wearing a headset. My memories of this experience and TheBlu is just being there but I dont recall pixels or even wearing anything when I think about it now. Just feels like I had a lucid dream and was transported to these places and feeling a sense of amazement and happiness. I suppose one can describe all this as a suspension of disbelief.I know exactly what you mean!  After the fact Its definitely less about remembering playing something and more about the sensation of actually being somewhere else entirely.I also agree that this feeling bleeds over into real life. The first time I played Job Simulator I also did the chef job.  Afterwards I went to unload our RL dishwasher and there was this weird point of mental confusion because the plates I was holding were suddenly very heavy compared to the ones from the game moments ago.

7554655,0,t1_d30vcy2,The need to peel apart multiple objects or multiple LEDs is usually addressed by encoding data into the LEDs which is apparently Oculuss approach. The P glove used a similar system. So its not that you have to separate one set of identical LEDs from another. However the encoding can introduce delay if its only done by the sensor LEDs because for example it might signal by pulsing certain LEDs and if those LEDs are off for a frame they cannot be used to track. However using extra LEDs to signal which segment you are looking at can avoid that. Lighthouse doesnt have that problem since it has more sensors and they already know who they are. However the scanning aspect means that the pose isnt read all at once which raises its own issues which Valve seems to have sortedworked around on the whole. Re accuracy with guns etc commercial optical tracking systems have been tracking with high accuracy for years now. I dont believe the technology is necessarily going to be CPU bound there are a whole lot of optimizations that can and probably are being done like the LED signalling mentioned. You might be right re why Touch is delayed but I dont really know and I dont think you do either. Its all speculation at this point along with the speculation as to why Oculus have dropped the ball so badly my moneys on a major manufacturing fuckup. I personally dont see why they dont have it out but then again I dont see why they dont have a VR agnostic wrapper out like SteamVR either because I think in the long run that will hurt them MUCH more than if they have slightly worse tracking than Lighthouse. Devs dont want to recode for every different system! I really want Touch but I lack confidence we will see it for a while yet. Given the fact that most people dont even have CVs yet I think Q is a likely release date. By this stage it better be SO MUCH BETTER than Vive that everyone wants it because if they dont get it out before then most people and more importantly devs will have supported Vive instead.,Vive,d30xfd8,1,t5_378go

7563780,0,t3_4iw7ql,Just so you know the Screen dooring actually happens from when the pixels are to far apart and yiu notice the black space in between each individual pixel.  If youve ever used a dk youd know exactly what Im talking about as the black bars in between pixels where about half the width of an individual pixel. Id argue the vive has almost no screen door effect but suffers from a low resolution as you can see the individual pixels if you look hard enough however the space between pixels is still very small and doesnt give you the feeling your looking through a square screen door. The best way I think to visualize this is to get rid of screen door affect you can just shrink the screen until theres no space between pixels. However you also need to have a high enough pixel density so that the user cant distinguish individual pixels. This has at least been my experience playing around with my vive so far  the screen door is not so much the problem as pixel density is for these consumer VR headsets. ,Vive,d31yrfs,2,t5_378go

7612700,0,t1_d1w6tij,I thought the same when I first started playing windlands. The default controller scheme is the one that only lets you move forward and backward and its extremely clunky. There is however an expert controller layout which lets you move in any direction with just a touch. Still just a tad unwieldy because the momentum buildsslows gradually and it feels like youre sliding but once you get used to it Its pretty good.,Vive,d37ivr7,1,t5_378go

The title does relate to the video. We are pushing the HTC Vive experience Dont Let Go that will be launching Monday on WEARVR. Is our post now hidden? ThanksYour post is removed as indicated by the flair.  The removal reason was pointing out that your post title was promoting your platform in a way that lends itself to marketing and SEO of your platform.  If a user is posting a youtube for a VR experience  then the expectation is that the title relates to the VR experience and not some selfpromotional noise about the platform .People or companies posting their own stuff isnt a problem and a lot of it is very welcome.  However it has to be presented in a way that is geared towards the community and doesnt turn the subreddit into a billboard.  If you want to primarily advertise your platform rather than contribute interesting content to the community then that is what reddit advertising is for.Anyway seeing as your account history is one of heavily promoting your platform in a way that fits the definition of a spammer I think it is better you dont bother creating submissions here again and just let ordinary reddit users share what they find interesting in a more natural way.,Vive,d38srfq,1,t5_378go

Theyre pieces of shit and I ended up making some nasty holes in my drywall before I dug out some quality anchors from my toolbox. Now I have a patch and paint job to do. Do yourself a favor and use your own screws and anchors.Next I loaded up SteamVR and one of the controllers wouldnt connect. Had to do some digging before I found that holding the two top buttons will repair.Then I tried setting up my room and it just threw some error that it couldnt load the room setup. Had to kill all Steam processes and restart to fix.Then I loaded the tutorial and ugh... Jittery tracking on the HMD and controllers. Did some more research. Tried the sync cable and adjusting the base stations. Tried switching from USB. to .. Updated controller firmware. Seemed to fix the head tracking but the controllers still get jittery sometimes. It seems to happen when I turn my back to one of the base stations. Anyone have a fix for this?Anyway Im sure Ill get over it and have fun but its the nd day now and I still havent played a single game.

I didnt say anything anything about d gaming so you probably shoulnt make assumptions about what I think.  I was comparing seated VR to roomscale VR with touch controls. To clarify cockpit based games fall somewhere in the middles since a HOTAS is basically a touch control for the emulation and you arnet expected to explore the space anyway.  But for other gaming experiences room scale is a full level above seated VR.  There is basically a progression D imagery D imagery VR VR with head tracking VR with body tracking.  To me going from VR with head tracking to VR with body tracking is a pretty large jump.,Vive,d39qwig,-4,t5_378go

7638689,0,t3_4jx8qq,Dont have an untangle method other than how ushadowofashadow described. However regarding Holopoint I can advise on how to not get tangled.Really Holopoint is no more or less of a  game than Space Pirate Trainer is. The problem with Holopoint is that the game directs you to stand in the wrong direction. Personally I stand with my back towards the front of the playspace. This way I can see my health candles in front of me with waves of Samurai and Cubes coming in from the left and the right. You will have items come up from behind you which demand your attention in waves  but this really isnt any more frequent that Space Pirate Trainer. The big difference here is Holopoint allows you to start at later levels Space Pirate Trainer does not. So occurrences of these events is indeed more frequent. The other big difference is of course that the games menus have you starting off looking to the left or right of your playspace. This then requires that you spin all around and tangle yourself up. Play Space Pirate Trainer that way and youll get the same result.So try to keep your back to the front of your play space or to the back of your play space and youll rarely get tangled up. Holopoint and Space Pirate Trainer are two of my most played games. Ironically now its the slower paced games where you can easily loose track of how many times youve spun around which are the games that I can twist the cord up in. SteamVR should absolutely keep track of this and alarm you of it so you dont have to keep track of it yourself.,Vive,d3ah5mw,1,t5_378go

7641313,0,t1_d3amvwt,No this is natural.  Ive had this experience without experiencing VR yet.  Check this instagram see link and youll see it looks D even though its D.  It has to do with the colors.  Make sure its on your phone as watching it larger on the monitor doesnt have that effect lower contrast I guess.   I think the effect is redwarm color looks closer and bluecooler colors recede. Also if you find a book title with big red text.  Look at it in the dark and then shake the book slightly.  It looks like the red text is laggy thus making it look like the text is separated from the book and shaky.  I noticed this over  years ago when I was a kid.  ,Vive,d3arwqu,1,t5_378go

7646373,0,t1_d3axakd,Wouldnt you just end up with pointtowalk like in d games such as Diablo? I think that would kind of defeat the purpose of a teleport system in that it would be just as bad for nausea as a regular stickbased movement system.What Ive been using for my own prototypes and what I recommended to the dev in this discussion is to reverse the system Spell Fighter currently features. Make the ghost trail after you not go ahead of you.The problem we want to solve is that teleporting is a free pass out of dangerous situations. You want to be able to get to places and get into danger quickly but not be able to get out of danger immediately.The game currently does that by delaying teleports but it ends up feeling a bit restricting. If for whatever reason youd need the teleport to get out of a dangerous situation such as chaperone coming up you have to stand there with your back to your enemies  hold a button and do nothing while your ghost casually walks away. If you just want to go somewhere and its not a combat situation you also have to wait for the ghost to move first. Its not a very satisfying feeling similar to if you had to charge your teleport spell.My version is that teleports are instant but you leave behind a spirit at your old location that can still take damage as normal. The further away you teleport the longer it stays. There is a shortish cooldown on teleports that roughly corresponds with your spirit duration. Variant the spirit doesnt just stand still until it fades it runs towards you and you can teleport again once it reaches you.Now what you have is a system where you can teleport right up next to a big monster but youre still going to take damage if you decide to teleport away again. Ive used it in rough prototypes and it works decently. It achieves what I set out to do you feel hesitant to teleport into danger because you cant get out again. You cant cheese ranged enemies like in Vanishing Realms because their arrows will still hit your spirit copy after you teleport away.,Vive,d3bcnlk,2,t5_378go

7668763,0,t1_d3duke3,The Vive is an amazing machine dont get me wrong but the launch has been super wonky. For example they say that your card will only be charged when your product has shipped this is not true. My card was charged two weeks before then the shipment order was released for fulfillment not shipped then the money replaced in my account then the product was shipped and I was emailed about it  days after it was shipped then my card was charged and then the Vive came. Most awkward purchase of my life. ,Vive,d3dw7si,1,t5_378go
7669771,0,t1_d3dx39m,They might be waiting for more exclusive content to be ready. If they launch without people will just flock to Steam and theyd also lose their selling point of the exclusive gamepad content because nobody would give a damn about that anymore. If they officially promote a more limited roomscale solution than the competition they have to make up for it with exclusive content and that might just not be ready yet and worse its somewhat out of Oculus control. ,Vive,d3e0bw9,3,t5_378go
7669873,0,t1_d3dyl60,Thanks. Yeah this is what I do now. I guess it is down to personal usage too. I have my setup in the living room connected to the tv. With zero clicking then my wife can be watching Netflix and as long as the PC is turned on I could just pick up the rift and put it on and start playing without any interruption. But in the greater scheme of things this is a minor point as I love room scale. The final puzzle in The Gallery is an example of where we should be heading with VR. And despite my years of support for oculus they simply cant do this right now. Edit perhaps turning on one of the controllers should start steamVR? Anyway these are software solutions so I am happy to wait to see what they come up with. ,Vive,d3e0qup,2,t5_378go

As for your question.It probably has to do with the kind of TP that Chroma is its a reallistic bend it tries to emulate our world in Minecraft. Your brain can accept the blocky reality easily when it looks so close to reality.

7676062,0,t3_4kfttc,What games do you like?My most enjoyable experiences have been in the Budget Cuts demo Vanishing Realms and Audioshield.  Only one of those has any good level of replayability but were still in the early tech.I do not quite enjoy Holopoint SPT or Holoball.  Im not a score chaser  Im here for an experience.  They are great games in their own right but for me they didnt have any replayability after the first hour.  I keep coming back to Audioshield every day.   is crude but once you get past the graphics the gameplay is actually extremely well done.  Its a much deeper game than it lets on.  Well worth the price and uphrt is one of the most reliable and vocal devs Ive come across.  If you want a game with some RPG elements this is the one.Check out Altspace VR and Bigscreen Beta.  Theyre fun when youre just too damn tired to play a roomscale game.Job Simulator is super well done.  Its kind of ridiculous how well done it is.  Its just super short with almost zero replayability but it makes for a superb demo for friendsfamily.Hover Junkers I only played for  minutes and found I couldnt squat far enough to stay alive.  Ill recalibrate and try again soon.Out Of Ammo was great.  I only played for about two hours but Ill get back there soon.  Just dont have the time.  Definitely a niche product that everyone needs to have.  Theres nothing like it right now and pulling a  cal out of your pocket and loading it into a sniper rifle and killing that asshole that keeps shooting at you from  yards is probably the most satisfying thing Ive done in VR yet.Outside of ViveVR specific Minecraft is for me without a doubt the top VR game at the moment.  Search minecraftminecrift in the sidebar for installation instructions.  Get universe sandbox  especially if you smoke pot and sit on the floor in the middle of your playspace.  Take a moment to learn the controls.  Throw a moon at Earth.  Stare out into space for a while.  Create two suns and put them in a binary orbit then put a planet in the middle of them.  Just fucking sit there and revel in VR for a moment.  Lay down if you can.I dont have HVR or HordeZ yet but those are on my radar soon.,Vive,d3eq17z,4,t5_378go

Its because Oculus had developer kits floating around for some time when that video was taken. Lots of development support from the community already. They showed that VR becoming mainstream is very possible now. Valve and Sony had been doing VR RampD for  years already. But they were silent until the VR community was large enough.

7696729,0,t1_d3gxtez,Not really any rules that Im aware of. Generally you just want to get the Vive lenses as close as possible to maximize FOV without making contact with eyelashes or glasses. Your eyes will compensate for focus distance based on the setting so its not really going to affect the experience other than FOV. At the default distance setting I havent had issues so far with lens contact for those with glasses. If I move the lenses closer contact with eyelashes leads to frequent cleaning and not really worth the marginal increase in FOVEnjoy the Vive when it gets there!,Vive,d3h2ghg,2,t5_378go

I dont know if you have been following Oculus since the kickstart days but Palmer Luckey was very influential back then and has been up until late. To say he is wasnt would be the same as trying to rewrite history. Oculus Rift gained popularity not only because it was being backed by some big name programmers and companies which included Carmack but because it was a proof of concept for a real VR solution that was affordable. That was very appealing to VR community. And we saw that in his kickstart videoIt was very impressive that some  year old was able to find a method of making an affordable VR set that actually outperforms more expensive devices. Another reason why so many of us took such an interest in Oculus. Im not saying John Carmack was very influential to the success of Oculus or kickstarting the VR industry again. Just that he is not the sole person that deserves all the credit. We really have Oculus as a whole to thank for where we are today. ,Vive,d3hzn1j,1,t5_378go

Such as lev   for a basic tour of the solar system. lev   history of the solar system its development. lev   the suns evolutionphases and other stars. lev   closer look at planets atmospheres compositions temperatures. lev   the galaxy galactic evolution galaxy clusters and the wider universe. lev   intro to physics and general relativity... etc etc. Once you get things tuned up why not send a note to Neil deGrasse Tyson.. it may spark an interest in the VR realm for education?

7759588,0,t1_d3o5pq5,Yep I fell for that email. Lost all hope checked my emails at ish and saw on saying they had come in. Hopped in my car bombed it there  miles  hour each way to be told it was a hoax. Needless to say I lost my shit. That was the icing on the cake that they had been incompetant enough to not BCC customers private emails in their updates and therefore allowed this situation to happen. Spoke in person with Josh and with Scott who was the store manager both of whom have Vives on order too. Upfront explained Im not pissed at them personally as Josh in particular has been excellent with information and updates pretty much the only person Ive got that from at PC World. They are frustrated not as visibly as I was lol. Said they are trying to see if they can do anything for tomorrow but not likely. Tuesday it is from what they said. Sounds pretty definite but who bloody knows. Gave Josh my mob number directly and took his. Will be calling him in the morning for an update on Tuesday. They also discussed trying to sort out some immediate compensation perhaps in the form of a Steam code or game something like that. Very frustrating Sunday waste of a day but glad I went down in the end and spoke with them in person. Ridiculous turn of events couldnt script it really. But kind of funny now I look back on todays events mainly because of how ridiculous its all been but also because Ive calmed down with the help of my herbal friend. I hope everyone gets their Vives on Tuesday so we can put this mess behind us.And to the person who sent the fake email. You got me good job. I assume you were one of the people on the CC list in order to obtain everyones email addresses like that.

Im trying to offer constructive solutions to some of the problems.  I removed anything that might glare.  I cant mount them in opposite corners tho I do use the sync cable.  Are you suggesting Wifi is causing glare? Every game seems to require a minimum spec of .ghz and and a Geforce GTX  a hair above what I have.  OK... so maybe this causes the game to slow places or drop frames.  Doesnt explain the flicker or the crashing.

I still feel some pressure on the bottom edge of the HMD but all the other pressure is gone. The downside is that its additional stuff to put on. Right now I put on the headgear then pull the HMD on top of it. I have some zip ties I wanted to test to see if I could get the whole thing as one piece. The headgear doesnt line up perfectly with the strap attachments so I dont think it would be easy to just detach the elastics and replace with the headgear.

However I guess this was added at a time when youd usually have  maybe  FPS. At  FPS it does make a lot of sense to also have FixedUpdate run at  FPS.

Then have it so you lock the angle with the right trigger to then take the shot  maybe have you hold the trigger during the shotWe tried that exact configuration for a short while during the beta front trigger locks the front pivot back trigger locks the shot. Advanced players liked it better but it was confusing to beginning players so it couldnt be the default. Its on our list to add configurable input mappings for the controls so this will make a return as an advanced option before long.gt English you would apply in real life with your left hand using small movements.

Smaller more customized cases integrated into fitted backpacks smarter cooling smaller and modular batteries custom motherboards and smaller more efficient GPU are all very near and not hard to accomplish in the foreseeable future. And lets talk about the software. In a  years we might have light wearable VR appliances sans Windows that boot quickly into a VR home and allow you to roam only limited by the number of lighthouses.

7862296,0,t3_4n0lfb,Wow. very good question man. Ive been on this subreddit for the last couple months and I dont think Ive seen this question posed at least not as a title.Hmm my answer is that I think the honeymoon phase of VR could temporarily wear off and I could start to incorporate standard D modern games back into my gaming diet. Right now I play Vive  percent of the time and retrogaming  percent of the time. So I still game outside of VR. The thing that has been removed is normal modern games like Uncharted  and stuff like that. I havent played any of those games since getting my Vive. Its either Im going to play some VR or maybe fire up my Super Nintendo.One other thing we have to remember is that VR is just barely getting started and I dont think weve even seen the tip of the iceberg yet. I really think some random game could come out of nowhere to blow everybodies minds and then even if we lost that loving feeling temporarily it will return with reckless abandon. ,Vive,d3zskah,1,t5_378go
7863422,0,t1_d3zwxxl,I know I did. The Vive has both reinvigorated my love of gaming and made me realize that I cant imagine going back to a traditional d game.

7870715,0,t3_4n4avs,you are probably killing yourself by doing excessive cardio without preparation tone down your sessions and you will be golden  also i dream of connecting wirelessly a threadmill with the vive so people can make running a little more entertaining running through mars or something,Vive,d40qof5,-2,t5_378go

7871203,0,t3_4n43mb,This is pathetic. I hope that Oculus is at least talking behind the scenes about how to correct their image problem. Everyone thought they were going to be the ones to make VR mainstream but at this point it seems like theyre trying to kill it with DRMexclusivity fire.At the expense of sounding like another fanboy...

7871498,0,t3_4n41we,I still dont get why super sampling works at all. You render something at K on a K screen so that each pixel rendered has a pixel to go to. If you render something at K to be put on a p screen there are now  pixels vying for a single physical pixel. A pixel cant magically become  because of rendering.When you still have a single pixel displaying a single color why does super sampling do anything?,Vive,d40tuda,2,t5_378go

Use the same criteria you use for other electronics products that have a frequent upgrade cycle like cell phones PCs etc.  Even if you hold off now until the next gen you will still have to answer the same question buy the gen  now and enjoy it or wait for the next better version.The biggest difference might be in available software as there will be more available as time goes by.

7881941,0,t3_4n5ki3,I think the idea of a VR comic book is really cool.  Being dragged along from scene to scene could be a really great cinematic experience... but I feel like this demo was very awkward.  It treats you like a character but doesnt allow you to interact or drive the action.  I think the story would flow much better if you were simply a silent observer. ,Vive,d4204zr,1,t5_378go

7890746,0,t1_d42jzvg,I had the same issue. I have an ASUS motherboard too but a different model. I bought the Inateck USB card recommended in the Steam support for Vive and it fixed it. USB  vs  port didnt matter that wasnt it. My bet is that the ASUS USB driver doesnt quite match the USB spec. Even now when the Vive is plugged into the new USB  port it still pops up a warning saying could be faster plug into . port. No big deal not sure why.Right now my problem is that sometimes the display doesnt come up red light. I am guessing the HDMI cable may be slightly crimped but I havent ruled out some kind of software issue yet.,Vive,d42zrcb,1,t5_378go

This is how oculus claims they planned to make money  software sales through Home.So every Vive owner who cancels a Rift order by using Revive and buying Oculus Home titles is saving Oculus  right off the bat and making them money the way they said they wanted to do it.But yet Oculus breaks revive and apparently doesnt want Vive customers.

If they would have thought that the game will not bring enough money without the deal they might have decided otherwise. If you run a company and are responsible for it and your stuff you decide what is best for your company. At least if your company does not have a huge pile of money and is okay with earning less money with a game. There are many people who want you to do the right thing for the company. More pressure than many could manage or want to bear. Most would have a hard time if they had to decide what to do. While sitting on your couch or behind your screen it is much easier to know what is best and how you would decide many people allways know what they would decide if they where politicians....

7946946,0,t1_d48lbt7,gt I dont think the comparison to consoles exclusives is valid.    Why not companies are paid NOT to make a port to other consoles all the time its basically the same thing. You think maintaining multiple versions isnt worth it? Excluding half your market is a dumb idea so they get compensated for it very well. A studio with  people has at best  people working on maintaining the current version of the game to a specific platform so if youre making a game for the xbox youve got  people max on the payroll to make it happen. You think hiring  more people for a playstation version and effectively doubling your market is a difficult decision to make? Youd be stupid not to do it and the only reason studios do it is because either company is literally buying off that entire section of the market. ,Vive,d49b808,2,t5_378go

7964322,0,t3_4o94pb,The argument doesnt necessarily hold water to me store exclusives makes sense to combat any perceived competitive advantage that Steam might have in fact it makes MORE sense to me since youre selling content to the entire market rather than half or less of it.At this point even if Oculus feels like HTC has an advantage in manufacturing Oculus hardware orders outpaced their ability to ship devices so that disadvantage is essentially moot.Even the argument that any roomscale games are essentially a Vive timed exclusive is irrelevant because Oculus didnt have the foresight to have the feature and WHEN they release Touch those games will be playable on the Rift... if they released it tomorrow then that exclusivity period ends.Timed exclusivity isnt as bad but its a ridiculous move to lock it to hardware. Hell if they didnt make that move and the games were locked as exclusives in their store FOREVER Id even be ok with that even with the issues with their software but with the move to lock out Vive users it just ends up being arbitrary and indisputably anti consumer and bad for the fledgling industry at this point.Dont get me wrong obviously we love our Vives but its still early and we all need this to succeed and the moves that Oculus has made potentially stand as a barrier to that more than encouraging the growth of this.

For reference a GTX which is entry level card for VR is  Teraflops. Either that or reduced FOV less pixels. Reprojection is a gimmick. You can rely on it to save some frames every now and then but basing a system entirely on reprojection is...wrong! And in fact many people who tried PSVR Resident Evil got supernauseated from the experience. Sure FOVeated rendering will be a great improvement  it already shows in The Lab where Vive implements a similar technique without having to track your eyes and in fact The Lab is one of the bestlooking VR games out there. Still Just bumping up the resolution would not be that major improvement. They need to bump up the resolution dramatically to remove screen door effect. GPUs are not there yet. Well have a clearer understanding by the end of the year anyway but I dont expect a new Vive announce before end of .A good thing is Vive is easily hackable.

Admins need to investigate the same as they did with the battlefront subreddit where they fired all the mods.I cite the HTC issue because it shows that admins wont step up with respect to these software companies.  They are picking and choosing when to follow their own rules.It would take a minute for a reddit admin to contact oculus and ask them what has been given.Oh . one mod held a fundraiser for himself to get a free rift and palmer himself threw in money.

8025809,0,t3_4p5k6r,Years Im guessing. Well most likely see price drops and minor upgrades before any genuine next generation headsets. The current headsets really push even the best hardware so I dont think it would be wise to ask players to not only upgrade their headset every year but upgrade their GPU every year to match.What I can see though is Comfort options size weight lens glare SDE just some small things like that. Not worth upgrading for but definitely worthwhile little upgrades for someone who has yet to purchase.VR is in its infancy. Constant upgrades would most likely hinder its progress than anything.

8035015,0,t3_4p6xkm,My prediction for the next gen Vive is that it will be called Vive VR Boogaloo and will be available in  color combos bright pink and purple for girls and deep blue and neon green for boys. It will have a sensor that can detect when you are sad and will sing softly to make you happy again. This will be used rarely as most people are happy when they go into a virtual world. All headsets will be named George initially until you name it yourself. The headset will learn the name you give it over the course of a week like a puppy. There will be no foam face mask just a line of small sticky rings around the periphery of the lenses roughly where the face foam is on the first model. You will place marshmallows on the sticky spots and they will be the foam mask. If you use Stay Puft brand marshmallows the headset will say in Bill Murrays voice What did you do Ray? and the Stay Puft marshmallow man will appear in the lenses and menace you. This will be funny for the first  or  times after which everyone will just refer to it as that lame ass Ghostbusters gag.As the pundits predicted the controllers will be redesigned and modeled after the Rick and Morty show. The right controller will be Ricks portal gun and the left controller will be a Plumbus. Ricks portal gun will have a hidden feature where if you happen to run into Palmer Luckey in a VR chatroom or virtual press conference a small metal cup with  electrodes called a Testazeron will extend from the front of the controller and you can place it on Palmers nut sack whereupon the gun will say You like exclusives Palmer? Well this is exclusively for you! and it will emit a brief  volt spike into the Testazerons cup shocking Palmers manbits. Itll be great for parties and press conferences. And unlike the Ghostbusters gag will stay funny for many uses eventually becoming the VR equivalent of getting a pie in the face.So in conclusion the Vive  VR Boogaloo will continue in the tradition of being the industry leader in Virtual Reality entertainment and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Its going to be glorious!,Vive,d4j7m3w,4,t5_378go

Im going to post it soon honestly I feel like the Expert mod is more of a competition style mod or something where people play it for high scores and to see who can get through the song.    For me thats not really as fun my new ones Im making I havent changed the speed or amount of orbs coming at you so its still dead on the beat but Ive spread them out so you really have to use your core muscles to stretch and lean back to reach the orbs.  It creates an effect of constant movement to get to the orbs without it just being a constant barrage of orbs that youre hoping you can hit.  To me as a musician like yourself its more fun this way because you can actually dance to the song and honestly some of the songs where it does that pause beat where the orbs pulse towards you you have to have good rhythm to know when theyll hit instead of it just being a big crap shoot of whats going to happen.,Vive,d4o2651,2,t5_378go

It can be used to destroy the core.  The push back fix did help a little bit but its still possible to get in there as Ive done this several times by accident.

When I demo my Vive to folks I tell them that I want at least  hrs per person for them to get a good impression.The last time I showed it off one of the guys watched me playing Holopoint after he was taking a break. He commented that watching it on the screen really makes it look like any generic game but then knew he was in for something special once he put on the Vive.You try to explain this to PSVR and Oculus fans and as of right now they just dont get it they dont want to get it especially in the Oculus camp. No doubt the Oculus offering right now is impressive to someone who hasnt been a VR enthusiast for the past few years. But Im sure you agree now that playing typical games sitting down with a gamepad in VR just doesnt tip the scales for something you want to play these games.

8097660,0,t1_d4pytbu,It looks much better no doubt but the reason is because of the highly accurate AA properties.  Its the same reason that downsampling is used.  You dont get any extra resolution but the image is easier to make out as subpixel blending is performed.  With time factored in your brain does likely account for a lot of the slight blur that occurs however if you go down to a single frame and zoom in youll see that the result with SS is that more pixels represent a line than without it it is thus softer. Temporal blending is where the gain comes from and thats because of the subpixel blending resulting in your brain being able to figure out where stuff should have been at a subpixel level.  So yes taken over time with the brain factored in it provides more information but its still a softer raw image.  A subpixel accurate AA could do the same thing the big key is just that the subpixel blend move as expected over time so that the brain can resolve it.,Vive,d4q9070,3,t5_378go

So people constantly disappear and reappear. I find it an incredibly annoying distraction. Would love the same game but with trackpad motion. Hover Junkers is more to my liking precisely because it gives me total freedom of movement without chopping up my gameplay. Enemies dont disappear in Hover Junkers unless theyre killed or they log out of the game. Both are worth checking out.

8115182,0,t1_d4s4x34,Sorry I think I got caught up in my ramblings im quite drunk at this point sorry when I posted my comment so I dont know how coherent it was to be read.  I completely agree with you which was my original intention when I tacked onto your post... before I started rambling about all the shit I wanted and I thought would add onto the RTS elements haha.This game seems like it would be BEST as an RTS with FPS as a supplement which was my focus originally.  One of my main things was giving the Engineer Unit more responsibility to build up the RTS campaign and pushing the terrain assign for assualt campaign possibilities.  The VR community all seem to latch on to different franchises and cheer Here this one!  This has potential! and I initially joined the cries for Battle Dome but from what Ive played of OOA I really think if the devs have enough resources Out of Ammo can be an incredible game.  Itd combine Tower Defense RTS and FPS into a very strong and immersive VR experience.  I wont get into it here as I mentioned it in my other comments but OOA or a similar game can take the glory of RTS and mix it with the intense moments of FPS single player missions taking note of highlights from franchises like CoD and the like to make a cohesive and incredible campaign.  Theres been a lot of apps Ive tried but OOA really feels TO ME something that can stand out amongst the rest... in time.edit Ignore the first paragraph Tldr Im drunk In short yes I fucking agree.  This needs to be a primarily RTS game with some FPS elements.  I can find FPS elsewhere. ,Vive,d4s7xh8,1,t5_378go

8117472,0,t1_d4sa6wf,If youre serious about this I would highly recommend sitting down with a experienced disc golfer to explain how a disc should react depending on the throw.  Basically to start all discs will have a fade near the end of their flight.  If you threw the disc straight just like you do in the game backhand throw from a right handed player it would tail off to the left near the end of its flight.  Some discs will fade harder than others.  If you threw one of these discs that fades hard on an anhyzer line meaning angled to the right it would move in this right direction but slowly straighten out and eventually fade left again.  Reverse all of this for a left handed thrower.  TLDR its going to be difficult to model but would be amazing even if you could meet the physics halfway.  Also expect a barrage of questions about proper physics from disc players as the game picks up in popularity.  ,Vive,d4sh6be,4,t5_378go

8131689,0,t1_d4u28ma,Theres a ton of research on the subject.  Just look up any UI research.  Look at what products are successful and see that making a product not feel like technology makes it do well.  My background I have a degree in computer science and electronic media arts and communications.  Im speaking from my skill area here.Now it is possible that the author just didnt clarify very well that he was talking about interactions being based around you but it sounds like he is saying that games that take place in small environments are best rather than understanding it is a UI thing.  Overall this is really getting in to more detail than I intended though.  My primary point was that the author starts out saying hey I got something wrong that anyone that understood the industry knew was wrong when I first said it so heres my revised answer.  I promise its right this time... really...  Id advise using sources that actually have a background in the space and understand how humans interact with technology over a reporter who seems to have a poor track record of understanding what he is talking about.Note that also isnt to say that some people may not enjoy the small experiences more.  They have an intimacy to them that some people may find preferable just like some people prefer small coffee shop bands to woodstock.  The amount we enjoy an experience also has a huge impact on our ability to get lost in it.  Im a huge space flight guy so for me something like ED is likely to evoke the most presence.  For someone who doesnt like that kind of thing it isnt likely to do much for them.  Conversely I know a lot of people love Job Simulator but it bores me out of my mind.

It seems like you wouldnt need to simultaneously ride the coaster to enjoy the VR simulation of it. What they should really do is implement augmented reality akin to the hololens to roller coasters. That way youre just adding special effects to an already entertaining experience and its a much less disorientating experience to average consumer.Having said that having large roomscale VR local multiplayer shooters at theme parks is a much more practical idea and I would totally do that.,Vive,d4wq8pr,1,t5_378go

Supersampling is the cure for EDs aliasing issues but it is very demanding. On my  I can run at . SS with most things up to Ultra with good performance   FPS with choppy bits not in combat where it would matter. This makes the UI look good and readable. At . SS the UI looks sharp and beautiful but this requires turning down all the other settings to low and will drop to reprojection in combat.

Except that one time I installed the PSU first and couldnt  fit the mobo in after. . . . or maybe it was the other way around? we.The only thing to really do thats hard in the building of your PC is making special considerations for VRThe vive. Right now certain motherboards work great with the vive and others have bugs. Certain CPUs work great with super sampling generally current gen CPU while others do not aaaaand I think thats about all. Ofc youre probably not going to be able to get the right mobo with prebuilt at all unless you buy something fancy and out of your price range so building your own will be a lot better in this regard but somewhat of a hassle.Again you could ask some forumsubreddit that does this shit to help you out and do half the work for you just mention special concerns like all I really give a shit about is glorious VR porn.Its kind of like super expensive legos for adults except its actually easier than building most lego scenes.,Vive,d4wwqye,1,t5_378go

Wouldnt it be great if reality itself operated on your desires constantly adjusting itself in any way you want to fit whatever it is youd like most? Thats literally what youd experience with this technology.And since you wont have any physical body parts requiring nourishment other than your brain which would be hooked up to life support you wouldnt even have to give the real world any attention if you dont want to. That wouldnt mean youd no longer interact with people by the way anyone else hooked up to the system which Id imagine would be pretty common could visit you in your personal universe if you let them or you could go to a public simulation that while it wouldnt run solely on your desires like your own would would still be much better than the real world due to no physical limitations or anything like that. ,Vive,d4xsb1q,3,t5_378go

8173626,0,t3_4izv9g,Im pretty sure the Oculus is going to be the main VR headset for adventure gaming to be honest because of the touch controls since theyre all about interacting with objects and since the majority of their games so far look like adventure games of some sort. Either way Im glad to see that the genre is making it on both headsets.  its sort of like when Myst first came out in . It was a lot of peoples first experience with a d world even though that was just a slideshow of one P. This genre is so well suited to being the leader in big changes like this. Im hopeful that well see a lot more adventure games in general in VR because from what Ive heard shooting people like in GTA in VR is way too real and might just make adventure type games a lot more appealing. Anyways Im especially excited to play Adrift for the Oculus which doesnt look like its on the Vive yet but could possible be in the future. There could also be a work around but youd have to look into that. This game Adrift is basically the movie Gravity as an adventure game with a better story from what Ive heard.

If you use DV your video card should detect that its not actually a DV signal but an HDMI signal and just send the HDMI signal down the corresponding DV pins.As rfreeknz points out there seems to be an issue with the  GTX not correctly recognizing the DV source as having an HDMI sink so its unable to send the correct signal through the cable.,Vive,d50a117,1,t5_378go

I just kept disconnected reexplaining my issue getting transferred back to previous helper etc... Kafka would have been proud.Just a tip type ping every minute or so in the interface as to not be disconnected.The people really wanted to help me though and I was prepared with a picture showing the missing LED the report saying axis failure and even a link to this thread so the process was quite fast!And then I did it again  minutes ago with the EU support this time and it was even faster. They told me I should get the mail this week and they arrange for the pick up I was pleasantly surprised that someone would come to take it actually.The whole process should take between  and  weeks I guess!So all in all not so bad especially considering I can still kinda play in  with one base station until then.Will report as it goes.,Vive,d514ruh,1,t5_378go

The Vive has a miniDisplayPort connection on the incoming side of the interface box.  Your  will have several standard Displayport interfaces.  You are going to want a minidisplayport to Displayport cable like thisThey also make HDMI to Displayport adapters but theres no need for that if you get the right cable from the start.So youll run your VIve off of Displayport and your TV off of HDMI so you can get both sound and video on the TV and the Vive doesnt really care what kind of display cable you use because it runs its audio through the USB cable connected to your computer.,Vive,d582rpt,2,t5_378go

When touch comes out both should be able to do everything and it will be more a matter of choosing which is better aligned to your needs the oculus likely winning on ergonomics and optics but the vive having a better roomscale option.I dont expect the touch controllers  extra sensor to come in that cheap with the HMD price already quite high I fully expect the oculus package to be as much or more at least when buying separate. Bundled its likely they can bring cost down by not including the xbox controller.If you are making the decision right now the numbers dont lie... roomscale motion controls and chaperone are killer features and the vive is winning because its the only solution to offer them right now.edit as you are also in the UK and both companies are international.

8308143,0,t3_4t7zd9,If you like Racing Sims Project Cars is pretty damn good as a seated experience with an Xbox controller or a wheel if youve got one.I see you like Elite Dangerous.  Another space flight one thats really fun is House of the Dying Sun.  Its not open world and is focused primarily on space combat over anything else.  It also has an RTS style tactical view in which you can order other ships in your fleet around.  While it might not be a visually detailed as Elite Dangerous the game is just absolutely brimming with extremely colorful style and runs much more smoothly on my own system GTX ti.Speaking of RTSs check out Out of Ammo.  You might consider it more like a tower defense game but its got the basic RTS idea down.  I had no idea that an RTS style game would even work in VR.  Now I want a true to form Real Time Strategy in the vein of Starcraft or CampC.  The thing that makes Out of Ammo unique in this regard is that you can possess any of your ground infantry and it turns into a First Person Shooter with realisticish reload mechanics.  Very fun.Minecraft has gotten a bit old in the past few years.  Vivecraft however breathes new life into it.  Roaming around this massive world on a d screen and actually being IN the world are two completely different experiences.

8308535,0,t1_d5g3y10,I dont think we could make a way to keep the stock users out of the nonstock users games. But we could have a flag that lets people know that people in our server are using stocks. I think that would in itself keep nonstock users out to some extent. Then there at least wouldnt be as much midgame dropping. An already losing team goes down hard when their teammates drop because they arent winning so its not fun.Ive frequently played games where the enemy teams just slowly keeps dropping out until its a  on  game with  other people on my team. Ill usually try to change teams by dropping out but for some reason the system will put me back on the same team like  out of  times. A team switch option would be nice for these situations. Some times I like to just jump from the winning side to the losing side to see if I can turn it around for them.But then I just watch the team I was just on slowly dwindle because now theyre not winning. More than a few times Ive played switching teams to balance it out until it was just one on one. Then of course they leave and I have to look for another game to run everyone out of.Sorry this is turning into a rant. Just kind of annoying. The skill gap is real. And the only thing unskilled players can do about it right now is to lay on the floor with the shield poking their gun through it. Praying I cant just teleport behind them. Maybe there needs to be a mechanic to even this out. For example if my kill count is  to  times that of the next highest player maybe let the low kill count players see my model through walls. At least they might have a fighting chance at that point.,Vive,d5g4gbq,1,t5_378go

8310587,0,t1_d5gcayq,I would also recommend Sennheiser. Specifically I would rest get whichever open back headphones of theirs fits your budget. I think the HD is pretty good. Not only will the open back design help with sound quality but it helps a little to keep you aware of the real world. If you really dont want that you can just crank the volume up but its super helpful to be able to hear someone ring the doorbell or to be able to talk to someone who is demoing the Vive. The ventilation will help too otherwise the sweat and heat will definitely build up of you are moving around. The only downside Ive had with mine is that you do need to tuck the cord away a bit so it doesnt tangle and if you have a smaller head the headphones might be a little loose and slide a bit during really intense movement.

Maybe developer should really think about adding basic handcontrollers support? From your review it seems all the ingreedients are already in place teleportation option picking up objects etc. Maybe it wouldnt be as interactive as games that were built for motioncontrollers from the start The Gallery etc. but at least well get our hands in the game.

Paintball is definitely playable now just not silky smooth at all times and wtf RIP battledome!.But I also noticed that it wasnt just Rec Room loaded up SPT and had the same problem when turning around and looking at the ship. Never had an issue at all with that game and supersampling so maybe steam did something with the latest beta update that threw something out of whack?

8440033,0,t1_d5wad1b,Hey BHC dev here.  This game is primarily designed as a seated or standing experience so you control it with your Vive controllers trackpads or with an XBox controller.  Teleporting just didnt work with this games design.  We have some motionsickness mitigation  comfort mode turns where turns snap at  degree chunks.  Not too different than Minecraft on the GearVR.  On Oculus we have a moderate comfort rating so folks who have their VR sea legs should be able to handle it.  For other folks they can be the out of VR player or you can take turns the levels are pretty quick.  We tried out teleporting but it just didnt work with this games design but we still really wanted to make this game happen for the people who dont get sick from locomotion which in our tests is a majority of people.  I hope you give it a shot!,Vive,d5wjk36,7,t5_378go

8445353,0,t3_4vbw34,Quick Recommendation guide after playing so many VR Titles for BakedBufalo that was asking or anyone else that looks for quick tips  Must Buy Titles in my opinion     Raw Data FPS...amazing gameplay...true potential...fun     Project Cars Race Driving...beautiful experience...solid title     Elite Dangerous Wow factor just by travelling! ....very long deep and enjoyable gameplay compared to most VR titles.     Virtual Desktop your  solution to play any d game in amazing screen  d movies   videos  VR use of your pc     The Lab Casual Minigames and Free. better than most VR casual titles      CDF StarFighter Instant Action Space Fighter in stunning locations. Another very polished game even if it is in Early Access. This game has amazing potential and value for  UD.     In Cell Free Casual bizarre Racing but easy and good. Also...I would recommend to try this game as your first sick motion tolerance test.     Brookhaven Experiment or Space Pirate Trainer or Hoover junkers In place Shooters Against Waves....hoover junkers also has fun and polished multiplayer. All the  have a good quality level but they would be improved over time  I would still recommend to buy Raw Data firstAlso...not a must buy but I would recommend     Audioshield casual playing with music     Solus Project Survival with nice Story and experience...still average in my opinion.     Time Machine VR sometimes is not about the gameplay but the experience itself.     Trials on Tatooine is free...short and could be much better...but try it      Spell Fighter VR Amazing Ideas for RPG with bad graphics...posible motion sickness if choosing trackpad movement. Try to test yourself how can you hold or not motion sickness medium level.     Vanishing Realms great RPG ideas with good graphics that could be improved a lot. Also short for that price.     House of dying sun Casual and quick into action Space Fighter with more than average graphics.     War Thunder Free and very good WW simulator...try it!!     The Vanishing of Ethan Carter VR Beautiful graphics and experience. Average gameplay but good if you like exploration and adventure games.     Portal Stories VR Free but requires Portal   easy Level gameplay of Portal in VR almost no replay value     Bigscreen BETA Free Desktop in VR. Really good solution to play D GamesMovies in VR giant screens. If you dont want to pay for Virtual Desktop this is a good alternative but you will not have the D video player and the environments options of VD. Performance is almost the same in both... I would say VD is a little better on some games.if you want to check some user gameplay videos I have some of these games here   ,Vive,d5x7gpf,2,t5_378go

8455385,0,t1_d5ycxwh,I am pretty sure there would be. Check DocOKs website on how Lighthouse tracking works and see his analysis of the drift in the headset and controllers and how absolute position information from Lighthouse is used to correct for drift many times per second.No inertial tracking method is perfect and errors will accumulate. Lighthouse isnt fast enough to be a standalone tracking system and really only serves to anchor the inertial measurements. And without Lighthouse the inertial measurements drift. It is just how it is.So without periodically telling the system where the Steam controller is absolutely to anchor the inertial measurements it would drift away in some direction or other.Oculus uses the XBox controller with CV and we used them with DK. It isnt tracked but most software doesnt try to depict where it is either and for those apps that do they just depict it in a generic lap location.I am not familiar with what you mean about a tracked keyboard being aide woke? I assume you mean it wouldnt be very useful without tracked hands and fingers and I agree to some extent. It would be less useful but still being able to see it in the headset would be very handy at times even if you dont see your fingers.

I got my vive around the first of the month and the audio cable was janky  only sound out of left earSo contacted support and they said theyd send me a new one.Took almost  weeks for the package to show up. And when it did it was the wrong cable. They sent me a HMD USB extension.No clue what I would ever need use that for.Anyway I got back in touch with support and had to send them pictures of the packing slip and what I received and they said they would send me the correct cable..... well almost  weeks later they send me the package. And AGAIN its the wrong cable.So I now have  HMD USB extensions and NO working audio cable. Im still waiting to hear back from support. They had to escalate my support to a different department.I know this isnt technically the same as waiting for a bases station to be repaired but if they cant even send a new cable in a timely manner then I dont have much faith.,Vive,d62so9y,2,t5_378go

8514976,0,t1_d65rjyb,Personally I like it a lot and I show it off to any of my friends who ever express a desire to play a regular FPS in the Vive  and they tend to think its awesome. For the extra strongofstomach you can enable jumping and even grappling hooks in servers mods menu which I personally love. Low grav  jumping  grappling hooks feels badass if you can handle it.Itd be nice to be able to play with more people but IMO it doesnt matter that much since there are builtin bots that are pretty fun to play against while you wait for a human to jump in to your inprogress game. To me at least it feels like a pretty full game even if no live players ever jump in.As far as I remember from my Quake days this game is basically Quake in VR.,Vive,d65ximj,1,t5_378go

8531221,0,t3_4wlg4n,Yes you can read out the tracking data. For example you can write a python script that reads out the tracking data and send it to a pi. The example script stated in the Readme writes the tracking data of the HMD to standard out a  times. It should be no problem to modify it for your purposes. Only instead of VRApplicationScene which tells OpenVR that your application wants exclusive access to the HMD which the example uses you should use VRApplicationBackground or VRApplicationUtility for non exclusive access.Instead of Python you can also use C or C if you are more comfortable with these languages.,Vive,d67ythq,5,t5_378go

8550745,0,t3_4ww1k8,Hey guys just wanted to post a little feedback on my experience. So this is one of those games that ive really tried to like but have a hard time because the games feel so awkwarddifficult because the physics feel very off. For example I happen to really enjoy skeetball in real life and this is one of the few almost playable ones but I cant just swing my arm naturally without either the ball being tossed and bouncing around or hitting the ledge and just bouncing back out onto the carpet. It just doesnt ever seem to naturally roll like it should.So I just went back and played this again with the update and want to make note of some major things that have changed my perception! Changing player size has fixed issues I had with my arms being too long and hitting the skeetball machine awkwardly on swing. The manual teleport now fixes major issues with stuff being outside my bounds aka couldnt play because I couldnt reach it.ampnbspThe other Toss games likewise feel extremely unnatural but I feel this maybe just due to how things feel on the Vive maybe? Cannonball Toss and the Egyptian game are actually playable now!!! Before I got maybe  inampnbsp   The few games that seem to feel very good are the Boxing Shooting and Wack a mole games. Penguin is now my favorite though! Feels very natural! Just like playing table shuffleboard! ampnbsp   I do look forward to trying out the new penguin game though and il be glad to let you know what I think later if youre interested  Love the improvements!!! Keep up the good work! One thing I would love to see down the road is the ability to join up with other random people. It appears you have to just pass around IPPorts to play with others right now.,Vive,d6aez05,2,t5_378go

Stay calm but be very very persistent.Secondly if you are getting nowhere with the person you are speaking to ask for a supervisor. If they refuse ask again. Again be annoyingly persistent.  If theres no supervisor ask for anyone more senior. If they ask why tell them you need to speak with someone more senior.  Rinse and repeat until you get to someone higher up the foodchain.If they tell you someone will call you back make sure you get a time and if possible a name for who will be calling. Get that persons name too. If they wont give it sometimes its against company policy ask for their employee ID number.  Make sure you keep a record of exactly who you spoke to when and what they committed to doing.Overall it would seem you are clearly in the right.  You asked for a signature upon delivery. The item was signed for at HTCs facility. While I am not an attorney I believe your copy of a proof of delivery is legally admissible as proof that HTC received your basestation. The fact that they now cannot find it is entirely their error. You shipped in good faith. It was signed for by an authorized representative of the company. At that point they accepted responsibility for the item.  They then lost the item. It is their responsibility to replace it.Good luck!,Vive,d6gkpz3,10,t5_378go

8608163,0,t1_d6hdjai,Actually he shows some minimum requirements when you buy it says Reasonably fast quad core processorRecent nVidia or AMD graphics card nVidia preferredWindows  or higherOculus Rift DK Oculus Rift HTC Vive vorpX will not work without one of these headsets But if no specific minimum requirements and of course that message will be there the same one year later so recent graphic cards means nothing. So that means someone with a  can say have a recent card and reasonably fast quad processor with a k and expect it worked with ALL the listed games otherwise should specify the requirements for each game.Man what is the reason you want to defend vorpx so badly? Its a lie that Bioshock runs great in any good card i have a good card and gives even worse fps than Skyrim some times most time under  fps started in  fps. Just tried Bioshock to see if you were right.Obviously those are not the vive controllers in the video but how do you think vorpx can make the headtracking use lasers inside the room area to check rotation it emulates a mouse as can be seen clearly in the Skyrim main screen same can be done with controllers to achieve certain things like emulate a hold mouse click to send an arrow.Actually its a feature that is expected to had Vorpx in the future What The Future HoldsWhen I asked vorpX developer Ralf Ostertag about future plans for his software he confirmed that basic support for the Vive controllers would be added in the next update,Vive,d6hm6ls,0,t5_378go

8619101,0,t1_d6imevg,I would recommend checking out IIFYM.  For starters calculate your ideal bodyweight.  If you are underweight it will give you a number that you can use as a growth goal so that you know where you need to be amp what you need to gain to get thereNext use an IIFYM calculator to figure out how much energy you need every day.  This tells you how many calories total amp how many grams of proteincarbsfats you need per dayIt takes all of the guesswork out of it.  The concept of IIFYM basically boils down to two things first you gain lose or maintain your weight based on how many calories you consistently eat per day.  You can eat to maintain eat to grow or eat to lose.  In the strictest sense it doesnt matter what you eat only the calorie number.  Case in pointSecond if you want good results amp proper fuel you need to make sure you are getting sufficient quantities of the big three macros protein carbs and fat.  If you dont get enough protein your muscles arent going to grow very well when you exercise.  If you dont get enough carbs youre not going to have much energy.  If you dont get enough fat youre going to get depressed note fat doesnt make you fat...too many calories makes you fat period.  You can see the differences between say just eating clean and eating with focus by using macro numbers to guide what you put in your body rather than just blindly eating plain chicken amp broccoli all the time in this articleI was really skinny stick arms amp skinny frame for most of my life.  Later I got tubby gut only unfortunately amp thats when I got into food amp exercise.  Its no problem at all to gain weight but if you want it to be muscle instead of fat you need to  do resistance stuff to make your muscles grow and  eat to fuel your body to meet your goals.  Thats really all there is to it.  Whats nice about IIFYM is that they give you the numbers and its up to you to choose what foods to eat to fill in the numbers.  Technically you could eat ice cream amp protein shakes and make gains just fine although youll want to make healthier foods the majority of your diet for obvious reasons better for your body amp most people get kinda sick eating too much junk food lol.  But its been done!I dont know what the effects of weighted cardio in VR would be on building muscle would be curious to find out!.  I use calisthenics pushups pullups dips crunches etc. for building muscle.  Personally I mostly do cardio because my digestion is crap amp I feel like crap if I dont do a good halfhour of cardio every day lol.  I like calisthenics because you can do them at home without any equipment or with minimal equipment...I dont have a power station for dips but I do use one of those doorframe pullup bars.  I initially got into it from some DVDs by Calisthenics Kingz the information is good if you can get past the Geocitiesesqe web design.  Check out their Youtube videos tooPretty easy stuff to do because you start small amp build up.  Combine that with active VR games amp you have a pretty nice and FUN workout program that incorporates both cardio amp strength training!  That together with IIFYM which lets you know exactly how much protein amp stuff you should be eating really makes it a piece of cake.  Like today for lunch I had the new Whopperrito Whopper burrito yes its a thing which is  calories  grams of protein  grams of carbs and  grams of fat plus a medium Sprite  calories  grams of protein  grams of carbs  grams of fat.  Still have plenty of food to add for breakfast dinner snacks and desserts and STILL be able to meet my nutritional goals.All this stuff was a huge revelation to me because I had no idea how to gain muscle or lose fat before it was all just a big mystery.  All I could see was workout programs on TV a hundred different protein powders and energy bars.  Its all a bunch of BS just marketing.  You dont have to starve yourself you dont have to kill yourself in the gym and yes working out can actually be fun in fact I wish there were more calisthenics games like Shape Up for the Xbox Kinect because thatd be awesome!.Anyway I tend to go on amp on about this stuff.  TLDR  IIFYM tells you what numbers to hit every day but its up to you to choose what foods so its not really a huge lifestyle change because you choose what foods you eat to meet those numbers amp can keep eating the things you love other than you start counting your numbers amp weighing any food you make at home when you cook.  Annoying for a few weeks but you get used to it real quick.  There are even food services online that will do it for you if you have the cash amp would rather not cook too bad I spent all my money on my Vive so Im stuck cooking at home most of the time lol.  The only catch is that most people underestimate how vitally important food is re the  ratio for foodworkout...exercise is more to keep you healthy amp optionally make your muscles bulge secret on that exercise makes your muscles pop and to do that you just need to have a low bodyfat percentage so you can see them.  thats it!People have gotten weightloss results as well using games there was someone who documented it awhile back I think on the Wii Fit or something amp lost close to  pounds or so because if youre still eating as you normally do but upping your exercise then thats burning more calories.  So anyway its not rocket science or anything theres just a lot of baloney out there.  If youre skinny amp want to gain weight focus on food first exercise second.  But the Vive will definitely help your body be healthy amp also boost your appetite if you use it enough every day!,Vive,d6izk69,3,t5_378go

8625367,0,t3_4xyn6k,Same issue here. VR is an INSANE workout even after  minutes I sweat like a PIG myself Im by no means one of those thin skeleton supermodel types not grossly obese either but a regular size for my age near my s and Ill sweat like insane when the room temperatures are over C and playing the VIVE.My solution so far is to open all doors and windows and try to keep the room temperatures down to C but even that is hard when your computer is VRReady meaning youve got stuff in there that EATS power for breakfast lunch AND dinner just by turning on the thing. The computer can easily bring the room up C extra during the summer heat even in Sweden.Small things that I do to reduce sweat Play short sessions  to  mins max let the headset dry. Have some tissue ready to wipe off your face each  minutes this will help you extend your play without too much sweat. Drink less alcohol yes youre in for a healthier lifestyle now that youre gaming VR fullroom scale and this is REAL WORKOUT even if it just feels like youre playing games. D  This had the biggest sweat reducing effect on me. Also eating healthier food less red meat does help reduce sweat. Do VR in the Nude nothing lewd if youre alone curtains drawn...then why not? ...Oh and did I mention your sweat is good for you?

Networking jitter would completely break the guns and theres no animation to network sync like in a traditional game as the pieces of the guns in H moving are done entirely via code and actually drive logic. The bullets are also all real projectiles not hitscanstyle like most fps games but theyre realistic velocity so a single frame discrepancy is actually a major issue.The only way I could see a game like H working is if it was built on a deterministic engine where only input positions were being synced so a minimum of data could be transmitted and the simulation would simply be the same for all players.

8724731,0,t1_d6vlkia,I can respect your point of view and I dont think you deserve to be down voted. You need to feel like the  is worth while. For me I dont mind spending  on  minutes of a VR experience if it is a well made experience. And I am purposefully saying experience rather than game. I wouldnt want a  ten minute wave shooter. That sounds awful to me so I can see why this deal can sound awful to you. But something like theBlue or La Peri I dont mind spending the money that a couple of beers or lunch would cost me. I thought it was really cool to watch someone motion captured right there in front of me. The music the art the narration it was cool. And it is still cool to demo to others and see their reactions the first time. But that is just my point of view or review of why its worth it.I also have friends who have never ever bought a . phone app refuse to ever buy an app even if it would be fun or useful to them.

8773865,0,t1_d72e53r,I imagine a gun stock would be incredibly helpful but after two hours playing without one Id say its fine. It gets finicky with the proximity grip Id frequently let go of my rifle with my right hand and try to draw my sidearm or grenade only to realize my left hand was still locked to the barrel.I had no trouble with mics but YMMV.Edit not a bug but I did have a hell of a time changing equipment. When youre holding a gun you unequip it by moving it onto your body and pressing the grip button sometimes both hands are necessary sometimes not. When youre holding a grenade you unequip it by moving it onto your body and pressing the trigger which makes me terrified every single time. When youre holding the iPad you unequip by moving it to juuust the right position behind you and pressing the menu button. When youre holding the needle I think you unequip it by moving it onto your body and pressing the trackpad but Im still not sure.Four different buttons for the action of let go of the thing Im holding? Really? I was hunkered down behind cover as a firefight broke out all around me hearing bullets whiz past my head teammates on both sides of me returning fire... and I was sitting on my ass with a needle in my hand trying to figure out how to get it back into my pocket. For long enough that by the time I got my hands on my gun again I was the only one on my team still alive meaning my teammates were all probably laughing their heads off in Spectator mode as I derped around like a battlefield Surgeon Simulator.Its... not that big a deal I guess.

8777417,0,t3_50btkd,Hi there. If youre using Revit check out an offering from Autodesk called Autodesk Live It will convert your Revit files to Live files with automatic materials conversion! Live comes with canned functionality like walking around doors that automatically open and close but more importantly your Revit data comes across and is available via object interaction. Live is also compatible with the Vive in the next release. You can also take your Live file and easily convert it to an Autodesk Stingray Autodesks realtime game engine offering file. From there you can do anything you want in terms of creating functionality. The Stingray to MaxMaya interop is seamless giving you the ability to modify materials add lighting and geometry plus live camera tracking so you can preview your camera path in Stingray from MaxMaya. You get Beast light baking Scaleform Navigation all built in Its slightly bad ass.  day trials for all. ,Vive,d72ug9o,16,t5_378go

8851636,0,t3_51gvng,I havent used it personally as yet but it does seem to support trackpad locomotion out of the box EDIT with a small difference to Onward as explained by the dev below...gtTouchpad Movement VRTKTouchpadWalkinggtOverviewgtThe ability to move the play area around the game world by sliding a finger over the touchpad is achieved using this script. The Touchpad Walking script is applied to the CameraRig prefab and adds a rigidbody and a box collider to the users position to prevent them from walking through other collidable game objects.gtIf the Headset Collision Fade script has been applied to the Camera prefab then if a user attempts to collide with an object then their position is reset to the last good known position. This can happen if the user is moving through a section where they need to crouch and then they stand up and collide with the ceiling. Rather than allow a user to do this and cause collision resolution issues it is better to just move them back to a valid location. This does break immersion but the user is doing something that isnt natural.gtInspector ParametersgtLeft Controller If this is checked then the left controller touchpad will be enabled to move the play area. It can also be toggled at runtime.gtRight Controller If this is checked then the right controller touchpad will be enabled to move the play area. It can also be toggled at runtime.gtMax Walk Speed The maximum speed the play area will be moved when the touchpad is being touched at the extremes of the axis. If a lower part of the touchpad axis is touched nearer the centre then the walk speed is slower.gtDeceleration The speed in which the play area slows down to a complete stop when the user is no longer touching the touchpad. This deceleration effect can ease any motion sickness that may be suffered.gtExamplegtVRTKExamplesCameraRigTouchpadWalking has a collection of walls and slopes that can be traversed by the user with the touchpad. There is also an area that can only be traversed if the user is crouching. Standing up in this crouched area will cause the user to appear back at their last good known position.As stated above with Headset Collision Fade VRTKHeadsetCollisionFade the kit will move the player back to the last valid position when they collide with an world object. With Onward the view fades to black but the script also supports this so I would guess it would be relatively simple to replicate the Onward type locomotion fully with a few changes. But the dev will be able to confirm this.  Must admit Ive not looked at VRTK in much detail before it is a fantastic asset for VR. Congrats to the dev!,Vive,d7buape,5,t5_378go

In order to assist in the process I wanted to give you a brief rundown of the events leading up to the hardware failure.gt I received my Vive in late May. Initially I was using for around  hours a day for about  days a week. After the second week of June I did not use my Vive as regularly in order to focus on work and course work. Instead I used my Vive for around  hours per session  times a week.gt My bedroom is on the second floor of a house and large enough to accommodate . x . chaperone boundary. There is no local plumbing and the room faces the outside on three sides. I rent and therefore the home is kept in good repair. I have roommates but my room is kept locked when it is not occupied.gt I take extreme care of the Vive hardware and store it right side up on a small end table out of the sunlight. After each use I wipe it down with a soft cloth to avoid any moisture build up. I am a fairly active individual so it is not unusual for me to perspire when playing Battle Dome Paddle Up and Rec Room. I did encounter some minor driver and sync issues that I was able to troubleshoot myself. These werent game breaking and therefore did not merit a RMA request it was clearly a software concern.gt The day before the issue occurred August th I was playing Paddle Up for about two hours in the late afternoon. I stored my headset in the usual manner and did not touch it until the following day when I returned for another round of table tennis. My HMD held a green active light but the display did not turn on. Display Mirror proved that the HMD and lighthouse tracking was functioning properly. Uninstalling all Vive USB devices and reinstalling the firmware did not resolve the issue. I reset the HMD by holding the side button and powering it on. I also checked to make sure that my in cable was properly connected. My roommate who also owns a Vive allowed me to test my HMD with his in cable and Link Box to no avail. This ruled out the softwaredriver concern on my end and led me to believe that this was a hardware issue.gt Based on my careful treatment of the hardware and external troubleshooting process I predict the issue is related to a hardware defect and by association normal perspiration as described in the HTC Vive Limited Warrantee. I can be reached via email or cell phone regarding the issue. Thank you and I hope that this information assists you.gt gt Sincerelygt gt uItsAllSoClearPlease do not copy this word for word.

The threads are elastic so the harder you twirl the more they stretch. And if you pull more or less on the trigger you can also control the distance. Then I let loose in the direction of the target and see them fly off. Its really relaxing to me.,Vive,d7mp2th,1,t5_378go

Its much less intense an experience and more of a jump in and have a ball like Rec Room paintball level fun without the elite level guys stompin on newbs. I hate to describe Rec Room like that but there are a few that take it super seriously even thought its a fun oriented approach. Love me some RR too. Exact opposite would be Hover Junkers. I love that game but the level of talent at the top end just destroys everyone else. Its great when balanced but when it isnt its hard to have a good time.

9024082,0,t1_d7wg5ga,You are right obviously the workflowapp marketplace has a ways to go before it can really replace something in a full productionD pipeline... but if you think the experimenting in these fieldsapps right now are not a good idea... thats where I disagree. Technical issues aside creating a character in a VR room scale environment then exportingtweaking outside the app is an insane feeling for creatives that is hard to capture with mayablendermax workflow. I have always been pushing for less technical processes in D and ones that allow for pure creativity and less barriers and these should be FUN ultimately not a chore. Tilt Brush while on the surface allows for some simple and neat effects like you mention has potential to be used by many non D types to at least rough out ideas in a D space without ever learning intensely technical appsprocesses. I for one also am able to concept environments very quickly in tilt brush when I struggle doing so in zbrushcinema and to me thats huge... Either way its all very new and uncharted waters at the moment but never in my life have I felt more like Tony Stark when creating a character in tilt brush when I am dragging the scene around using the controllers with scale and rotation and see a character life size in front of me. ,Vive,d7wjxhx,14,t5_378go

9057895,0,t1_d7zsl6u,Some feedback Whats with the rubber on either side? I am  convinced that I keep missing backhand topspins and underspins alike but it seems I can nullify any incoming spin with the black side no problem gt pipped rubber right? This is not an issue if I switch I did get some tasty backhand shots for sure with the red rubber. Rallyingsmashing isnt really implemented is it? I feel like the direction is sort of arbitrary. Also haptics need improvement. Vibration is way too low for hits although balancing the ball on the paddle feels eerily realistic. The direction is definitely right. Sounds tying in with the previous bullet point there are very distinct clacking sounds to hard hits which again I dont think are in the game yet smashing of course as well. This is so important for it to feel even more real.For now I want to be able to pretend I am training. Let me work up a sweat with rally regiments so far I feel like it is more about getting that one lucky shot. This is obvious I guess but hey you probably are aware of the broken scoring system. Its all over the place.  Exiting the menu layout without the button will place the cursor right over the quit button. Left the game a couple of times. I feel like there is a solution to the fov problem as in without peripheral vision you have to wait until just before you hit the ball. Clearly not your fault but it still feels like garbage. I bet there is some kind of indication one might implement that will distract from that fact or something did you consider doing something about that yourselves? Whats with being able to change the height of the table? That doesnt feel right at all. Not only could you arbitrarily change your height it also prevents you from getting accustomed to one or the proper view. Very noticeable.Either way I really enjoyed it so far. The ball physics themselves are amazing and entirely believable. We need freestyle modes party modes training modes and more believable paddleball interaction but still... this is awesome.Also heres a pic of my hand after one session. It will get worse I guarantee it but if it takes a blood sacrifice for me to get to play table tennis whenever I want... Im down.Minor injuries aheadPS I think this is an issue with the Vive controllers in general that is I dont think they align well in space but here it is especially frustrating. Please let us chose between styles I myself would really welcome a shakehand gripoption. My thumb would wrap around the top part of the wand and meet my middle finger on the back just above the trigger while my index finger would rest on the ring. Make that grip align with how you would properly grab the paddle gripping comfort is really important as well.Some arcady mode would be awesome as well powerups events... Im sure youve got plenty of ideas of your own. Keep it up!PPS I keep having so many afterthoughts. Anyways I wanted to say that multiplayer felt really good.

You could travel the ghost through walls and grab keys and things and absorb shots with it. Then the robot could shoot stuff and move around. You could totally do a marionette fighter game.

9065004,0,t1_d816a2q,I would imagine that creating localized text for people who are using Unity should be fairly trivial.  I would probably create a .NET class library and add a resource .RESX file named according to each of the languages it supports.  The resource file can be handed out to people for translation to the languages you choose to support and copied back into your project.  Satellite assemblies will be created for each of the languages for which you have a matching .RESX file.In the case of number formats the .NET libraries have methods for creating displayable numbers for a particular culture as well people just need to get used to using those.The only thing I see as being the more difficult part of the project is getting quality translations however Im pretty sure you can probably find some multilingual volunteers if you promise them a copy of your game.Hopefully the text doesnt have to go through multiple iterations and you make sure you check it carefully for spellinggrammatical errors.  Unless youre creating a VR Text Adventure you probably wont necessarily have a lot of text.Whatever you do though resist the urge to use Google translate to translate your text the results can be comical some times.,Vive,d81gtqc,0,t5_378go

9067918,0,t3_54glp9,Just did this myself on one of my controllers that had this problem.  Used a couple YT vids out there as a bit of guidance.  In my case and there was actually nothing visibly wrongaskew with the rubber pad that I could see I just used a small circular piece of sticky duct tape to cover the pad.  Works like a charm now.  I think that maybe in some cases the rubber pad may just not be thick enough andor the little actuator button can cause the rubber to be slightly compressed to one side.  Without opening the working controller I had nothing to compare it too but it certainly wasnt out of position.While the fix is totally doable know that its not quite for the faint of heart and most likely will void any warranty.  I figured that the hassle of trying to deal with CS and getting it RMAd was worth the risk.  Although there were a couple of times during the teardown that I thought Welp there go my Vive playing days for quite awhile.   If you do attempt it just take it slow use the proper tools and dont lose any screws.

Valve is an existing digital distributor with an established online presence and large customer base.  They have a lot less to lose if the Vive loses market share versus Oculus and the Rift.  Heck Valve really doesnt need to be in VR at all theyre in it because they want to be.Meanwhile Oculus is solely a VR company.  If they dont gobble up market share for the Rift they lose by default.  Hence they are employing a significantly different strategy than ValveHTC.  Whether or not its the right strategy in the long run remains to be seen but as I said I understand why they are doing what they are doing.,Vive,d8jq46x,6,t5_378go

Calling a lot of the available experiences tech demos is doing a huge disservice to the time and effort put into creating them. Games with long unfolding stories and experiences will come in time but if you were expecting them from the get go even on PSVR youre too early.Also I watched the video you linked a while ago. They manage to ruin the fun of literally anything.

9243464,0,t1_d8nnr7b,Dude its a megathread. mega thread. The problem exists. People are just over the issue because its not a serious hindrance. Theres no point in discussing it anymore everyone knows that you can only reduce jitter by mounting your base stations more securely everyone figures this out after a basic search. Are you seriously saying jitter doesnt exist when there has been so much discussion in this subreddit over it? Problems dont cease to exist just because people get tired of talking about them. Nevermind that we are past the setup stage the Vive has been out for months.And it is mentioned in the current stickied thread did you not click my links?    Its also in the wiki under troubleshooting   Like what else can I show you? Are you even clicking these? Its in the freaking wiki!!!!   The units themselves create vibration and must be completely steady to eliminate jitter.Just because a problems impact can be reduced doesnt mean it doesnt exist. Also the Oculus tests were all done a few meters away from one sensor. Two sensors will reduce your jitter. Youre saying the results dont count because Oculus won despite the disadvantage? Just search jitter in roculus the only results are about the Vive and DK with one thread complaining about tracking issues near the edge of the sensor range or when turning around  sensors solves this.gtan issue that is inherent to lighthouseAlan Yates says it is he created Lighthouse why do you still disagree?,Vive,d8nocqu,1,t5_378go

I havent had an opportunity to demo it in real life so I have quite a few questions. Will the new wireless Occulus make the price of the Vive go down at all? Will the price ever go down before  years? How easy is first time installation? Does it take over your monitor or can you take the headset off and use the monitor with the vive plugged in? Do you NEED to install the lantern thingies to get headtracking? Obviously you need it for the touchpads but Ill be using headtracking  of the time Elite Dangerous and GTA VR. Can you just have headtracking mode in these specific games? Or do you NEED to have the lanterns set up? Can you get mods for first person games that just give you headtracking? What happens if you set up your lanterns in a room that is too small? My room is very small and I dont really have a bigger one.

9323309,0,t1_d8xs2ox,It is a little confusing as we released a free Tech Demo for Oculus in  before we had a proper studio this version came with specific versions of emulators within the pack through the autoinstaller this removed a slight step as the emulators were harder to find for bit back then.Now we have Neon that has a demo neither of which come with the emulators anymore due to legal reasons but this does not make it much harder as LibRetro have a new website with ease of access for the latest and best versions of the emulators and we have a good size community of people on the forums in once place now ready to help with any issues. Apart from that one step its just as easy as its always been. I believe its also not that hard to find fully preconfigured emulator and ROM packs made the community floating around.As for the visuals Neon is about x superior in both graphics quality and also optimisation. It looks better and also runs better. With proper supersampling high levels of optimisation LODs and multires shading from NVidia. Meaning you can really push the game and still maintain a solid FPS.

If it was implemented or not.You can see this by playing a flightsimulator a gametype that absolutely does not need roomscale. But it works.

9339032,0,t1_d8zr3mt,gt  It would be too much of a frame rate hog. Probably true. Ive been recording VR videos for a while and the way Im doing it is a bit different. While using a VR application the underlying infrastructure doesnt record rendered video frames but instead records the applications internal state that is times random number seeds all userprovided input etc. In essence its like recording music as a MIDI file instead of a WAV file.This allows the system to play back a session exactly as it was performed the first time but since it now no longer involves the user it can be played back at any slower or maybe faster speed. On the second runthrough the infrastructure can render whatever it wants however long it takes. For example it could render six square views arranged as a cube and then resample that into a fullsphere monoscopic or even stereoscopic video. I can even play back sessions inside another VR session for fullyimmersive and headtracked replays like in this video Watching myself building a moleculeThis approach works automatically with most applications except networked ones where the application itself has to contain some extra logic to record events coming in from the network. But other than that I think its a neat way of doing it.,Vive,d8zsgqr,2,t5_378go

9384468,0,t1_d95crt3,I have a question as a new Vive owner.  I tried out two Ping Pong games cant remember the names and hear Eleven is the best.  How is the physics?  In the other games the hitting is unpredictable compared to real life.  The ball floats if you tap it like a normal shot back spins either fly out of control or barely go a foot. Side spin is similar to back spin. Also the ball seems to float.  In real life the ball moves and falls relatively quick especially with top spin.  In these games the ball in a lot of cases floats and barely misses the outer edge of the table.And hows the multiplayer?  A decent amount of players?   Id absolutely play this game daily if the physics and multiplayer are there!,Vive,d95jpk6,1,t5_378go

Vive is amazing for active roomscale but it is not great for extended seated play sessions.  It becomes uncomfortable after  min to an hour.  If someone would release a good comfortable harness for the Vive Id be all over them. Until then Id honestly rather play a graphically inferior version of this kind of game on PSVR.

9431558,0,t1_d9bhltn,Why would they need  lenses? Moving the screen towards the focal point of the lens makes the image appear infinitely far away to your eye and moving it towards your face very quickly makes it appear inches from your face. A cm of range would cover anyone who can see from  inches in front of their face to anyone who can focus on infinity. Now the size of the screen would appear slightly differently..but that already happens when you have to move the headset front end back to compensate for glasses. ,Vive,d9bijjj,1,t5_378go

Especially the Seamoth with the way it keeps autocorrecting your heading and jerking your view around.  That was terrible on a d screen I can only imagine its infinitely worse in VR.  Also I read somewhere that movement is all lookoriented.  Like you cant be moving in one direction while youre looking somewhere else.   Kind of a dealbreaker there.

9452369,0,t1_d9e06nz,Completely with you. Having Zbrush VR enabled would be awesome. Sadly though from what Ive heard Zbrush would require quite a bit of rework to do VR. Mainly due to how its renderer works. It allows you to work at super high poly counts because of optimizations it can make about the viewport not movingrotating you can see this when your render goes low res while adjusting the camera. I mean its essentially a single render per turn compared to vr needing fps stereo if the camera isnt still and it never really is!Not impossible and hopefully something theyre actively working towards.

9477117,0,t3_5ai50k,I think he has a good point. VR is awesome right now but its not awesome in a way that is going to create the scale needed for AAA game developers to make a business case for throwing a bunch of money at developing premium games. The indie developers creating content right now are amazing for pioneering but for a consumer after the cost of the headset and PC to run them all you have are short and unpolished game experiences. Many of them currently selling as WIP. The current gen of hardware is just too expensive and too cumbersome. I have both a Vive and Rift. They are both great. But more often than not when I think of spending some time with VR I then think about the time it will take to set one of them up trouble shoot any issues that popped up since the last time I plugged them in and then think about what Im actually going to play and how much time Im going to spend with it and just say fuck it Ill play some regular games on my monitor. Not to mention the dedicated space I need to play VR. I also have PSVR and while it is an easier experience to set up its a rats nest of wires and boxes that is too unsightly to leave plugged in at all times and too much of a hassle to set up when I just want to jump into VR and play. A big part of me wants to sell all of them and wait a bit because I think Ive seen the extent of what this gen has to offer. I might just keep the Rift for driving games because its more comfortable for longer play periods but then again my Rift stopped working the other day and now Im going through the drawn out process of getting it fixed. Again its all just too much expense and hassle to expect any scale in consumer adoption and consequently game developer adoption at this point,Vive,d9h9c0v,1,t5_378go

Youre asking for modern smartphone features when were all running around with Palm Pres.  gtWe consider Oculus Studio first party titles. The developers can do what they want with their IP afterward but the funded titles will only come to Oculus.Yes the Oculus store. Just like HalfLife  wont appear on the Oculus store. That doesnt mean the games wont support the Vive in the future Touch controls havent even launched yet and you want them to have motion controller support.   All of those points you just made just further support the idea that Oculus wants to support the Vive and has no reason not to but they are not being allowed to do so on their own terms. Again Oculus wants native support for the hardware they want all their customers to get the same experience. That means ASW on the Vive Oculus Home on the Vive Oculus Social and Oculus Rooms on the Vive none of which is possible through the OpenVR shim that also just happens to open the door to any other OpenVR HMD from AntVR to Razers OSVR which are both shit.,Vive,d9luetc,3,t5_378go

ASW predicts where objects will be as they move and where the HMD will be as you move to create the new frame. The gif above shows this as the hand movement is predicted and adjusted as is the HMD position. Even the laser sight moves a little. Interleaved reprojection is more similar to interpolation on TVs the whole scene is shifted.,Vive,d9uosw1,12,t5_378go

9598159,0,t3_5cfn93,I think the key is to provide multiple different locomotion options into as many games as possible. Granted this is more complicated in Multiplayer as you dont want to create an unfair advantage for any one system but options are rarely ever a bad thing. And even if one system provides an advantage the other one is there for people who cannot handle the first for whatever reason.I like that The Art of Fight has two systems thought it was better when one could switch on the fly but whatever. Each one has people who prefer and enjoy it more so each person can use the one they like best  which is how it should be.And even with trackpad locomotion there are multiple ways to implement it. Base trackpad directional trackpad directional and also direction controller is pointing onward style just direction controller pointing AoF Easy mode.

And fans have off switches.As a final note its very easy to get turned around  degrees in VR space and a lot of people HATE the whoa Im facing the wrong way feel when they pull the headset off.

9668792,0,t3_5dfcu8,The nd thumbstick might be useful to have hands in a flight sim game that would require  sticks to control flight.   But Id prefer the  thumbstick on the left amp  buttons on the right. configuration.Just sell each controller separately and let people pick for themselves what combination of  controller types they want.  If someone wants dual thumbstick motion controllers give them that option.  Thumbstick amp Buttons so be it.  Dual touchpads you already have it.  Buttons and Buttons why not?IF you think its going to fracture VR to have so many different types of controllers for a VR headset.  Dont kid yourself.  PC has how many different types of controllers available?  It just comes down to the developer to let us bind our controllers properly to suit our needs instead of limiting it like they do to consoles.To the rest of you who think these touchpads are the second coming of Jesus for video games.... I understand where youre coming from. Ignorance. What you dont see is the other side people like me.These touchpads ruin VR games where I want to walk around beyond the MxM box.  So understand how fighting against the idea of giving a thumbstick option.... is forcing your point of view on me and others like me.So however much of an asshole I come off as making a point about touchpads vs thumbsticks.  Realize that you are the bigger asshole for thinking that I should go support Facebook if I want to play with thumbsticks. You should realize that there are other factors that motivate why someone chooses the Vive over Rift.   And it absolutely takes priority over the type of controls each offers.   What is sad is limiting players to an emulation of something instead of offering the real thing because of that choice.  In another   year  Ill still be waiting for those examples of games that take advantage of the touchpads versatility and youll still fail to offer anything meaningful to justify it.,Vive,da4vq8m,3,t5_378go

9717382,0,t1_daau8b1,Yeah definitely scarier than Brookhaven.  I havent play much of LeftHand Path yet but from what Ive played its scarier than that to.  A lot of it comes from jump scares though where creatures suddenly come at you from behind or from hidden compartments.  There are also a lot of loud machinery sounds in some areas that can be unnerving because of the fear that they are masking the sounds from nearby enemies.  Light and dark areas are also used to great effect and the pitch black that you can get in the headset makes it very effective with the flashlight.

9754177,0,t3_5ev1za,There is a very little known of tool in windows called the Reliability monitor or Reliability History depending on windows version. It is very good at helping to determine what was installed on the day the crashes started. But I dont think it will go back  months.It is worth a try. It shows a graph going back in time plotting crashes and errors. On a good system  the line will be at the top of the graph if you start getting crashes it marks the crash you can click on various icons around that time to see what was installed.In a stable system you go back in time scroll left and usually see a straight line steady along the top. Then if the crashing started at some point it suddenly Drops as your reliability index comes down.  If you then click on the icons around that time or just before you can see what was installed that may have caused it. Including service packs or installations etc.Uninstall the programs from around then and see if that helps.If yours goes back that far it may help pinpoint the cause.   I its not much use if you have always been having crashes as there is too much noise in the data. But on stable systems that have only recently started crashing its very useful if the cause is software related. I have used it successfully on several systems at work where users come to me and say for the last week or so they have started getting crashes. I go back to the point in the graph just before it started happening and If it is a software cause I can often see that they have installed something that they forget to mention Uninstall it and fix the issue. ,Vive,daff5ct,3,t5_378go

9782484,0,t1_daija9y,I wouldnt be so sure.They have certainly gone into a couple of partnerships with Oculus but they have with Vive too. you can buy the Vive from many Microsoft stores online and offline and they have Vive demos set up at their retail locations. They have announced VR headsets by other manufacturers which will work with Windows  and from Microsofts history we can expect them to want to provide the software backend for every headset on the market not favouring one over the other it would be very unlike MS to pick a side.Now this particular case could well be tied in to Oculus at the moment indeed it would seem likely that they would have announced it for Vive if they were able to. But it seems to me that it would put MS in a very strong position to be able to support both headsets with their home console so I wouldnt rule out an announcement. ,Vive,daiwl4c,2,t5_378go

9784389,0,t1_daiwbi0,Thing is there are many other stores that you can buy games from. So its pretty easy to boycott the shitty ones. It either comes to you wanting to support the devs or you not giving a shit. I want to support the devs thats why I stopped pirating games when I made that decision. Thats also I never started to buy from stores that have a very likely chance to sell games aquired ilegitimatelly. To support the devs. When I buy a Nestle product Im supporting the people that made that product. If there was a shop that sold Nestle products cheaper but Nestle didnt get sny of that monry I wouldnt buy it. My philosophy is this No matter how shitty a company is if I want to use their product they deserve my money.

It wouldnt make me nauseous very little does these days thankfully but it would make me very disoriented.  If you get a chance test it out on yourself!

9827416,0,t1_daoferh,I tried both starting with button press then physical press it was just an afternoon experiment in a playground project  Theres a zone around the UI that effectively puts the hand into UI mode and intercepts the inputs. I found it nice having the pointed finger and also gives a clear indicator of you can interact with this in much the same way as the Orbus has the aiming line above its really clear. I actually thought it was an interesting tradeoff when I was testing it with Touch controllers  With the Vive auto posing works and gives that clear visual feedback that you can interact with Touch you let the player point themselves which is more interactive but its up to them to know when they can or cant touch things. Interesting problem for sure For touching I had multiple zones First around the UI block was the UImode enabler as above. Then a smaller zone around each button which counts as your typical UI hover mode the icon changes you get a haptic click and a light sound effect. Finally when move your hand into the button theres a pressing zone that triggers icon select and another more intense haptic buzz and sound effect. The pose itself was just an override on the index finger bones so still works when youre holding an item or a sword etc.Physically pushing was nice with all the layers of feedback to make it feel more solid but sometimes its hard to beat a button press for simplicity and responsiveness  Having the pointed finger and holding out my own so it lined up was pretty nice but different hand shapes etc mean that wont always work I guess I had the hands scaled somewhat to my size.,Vive,daoj7yt,8,t5_378go

I cant wait! no really Ive signed up for beta testing I played a ton of textbased MUDs way back and have been longing for that to be reborn in VR.  I hope design will be really tuned towards encouraging teamwork and dependence on each other for success. Ive been watching all the videos and have had most my questions answered. Glad to hear locomotion will have many options. In an early video you spoke of puzzle mode and being placed in different locations each time. Are you or have you considered procedurally generated levels? Randomized layout challenges puzzles and secrets should add much to replayability. The current grid like design of the labyrinth seems to lend itself to it.It would also be cool if there were some overarching community goals perhaps building up to raidsevents. Something like say Find the  lost runes in the  lost tombs. As each are found they are displayed in the tavern for all to see the progress. Each unlocks some of the lore of the world with hints to the next location or requirements for its unlock.,Vive,dapmv5o,3,t5_378go

But you had to calibrated them every damn time you plugged them in.They got super hot had nothing to block out glare. And didnt fit over glasses very well because they sat on your face like glasses anyway so they fought for ear and nose space. They had built in earphones and a mic that worked quite well.

9904048,0,t1_daxrix7,Im not a native english speaker so Im sorry if I dont get a phrase or two right but if Im driving and I have the right of way and at a crossing someone doesnt stop to give my right of way to me I could just insist on my right and be part of the cause for an accident as obviously the other driver is too. Or I could break and give up my right of way to avoid an accident. And maybe he is breaking too and all that happens is two people who are maybe really scared but alive and otherwise unharmed.The thing Im trying to say is sometimes having a right doesnt mean that insisting on it results in something good. And I dont think the other driver or developer did something wrong intentionally. The only way I can imagine it could have been intentionally it would be because he wanted to commit suicide...More to the point developers have the right not to develop for VR because they think its getting a bit toxic and it doesnt pay off that well or... You get the point. Do I want them to stop developing for VR because its their right? Maybe not. If I want them to develop for VR instead of using their right to stop developing for VR maybe its a good idea not to insist on my right to bitch about every move they do  even if I have the right to do so. Its just because... I dont have the right to get good games in VR just because I bought a HMD. For good games I need a developer who uses his right to develop whatever he or she wants to develop said games  just as much as he needs a customer and maybe sometimes  especially in a market in its infancy  some additional money to sell the games at a reasonable price. And Im pretty sure a developer will go where he finds a customer that just pays his bills instead of hunting him down for a timed exclusive and threatening him not to buy his products ever again just because the customer has to wait. And Im not talking about gamecrashing bugs or a really bad game  thats still a valid reason for complaints in my opinion because I still think customers should get a good product for their money. Im talking about things someone might have to do to deliver a product in the first place.I for my part wouldnt risk my job which Im doing for the last  years for a risky job  as interesting and new it might be for me  which doesnt pay that well and say No to someone who offers me a safety net to pay the bills for may flat and food and what not... And even if I would take the risk I would get out of there asap if I see a real threat for me and my family something like not earning enough for living any more. So  and that might only be me  Im happy about devs which take the risk even if they need to take money for a timed exclusive and I will not complain about it while Im not knowing why they did what they did and impute something they didnt think or intended to do as long as I will eventually get a good product for my money.And maybe the solution to our problems is on its way since HTC Oculus and Sony teamed up with some other guys in the industry. Someone remembers the news about  and the press release?The goal of the Global Virtual Reality Association will promote responsible development and adoption of VR globally. Associations members will develop and share best practices conduct research and bring the international VR community together as the technology progresses. The group will also serve a resource for consumers policymakers and industry interested in VR.Does it solve our problems for now? Maybe not. Is it a step into the right direction to get all big players in VR on somewhat of a round table and to talk to each other? Hopefully yes.,Vive,dayir9t,1,t5_378go

Unlike most devices on the market they actually worked closely with Samsung to truly have the phone act as an integrated processor and display in a real VR system rather than simply putting some lenses near a phone and calling it a day.I havent followed up enough on Daydream to see if that does anything similar but the vast majority of holders are simply over engineered google cardboards.Theres also a valid short term reasoning that Oculus is putting more money in to content now so in the short term there is more available for Oculus.  Yes you CAN run it with Revive but thats a technical thing that you still have to know how it works what the limitations are and be comfortable with what it is doing.  Its a much less end user friendly solution than having actual native support and thats what a Best Buy employee is going to be briefed on not what the high end technical market is doing as those people arent going to be talking to Best Buy employees seriously.Yes it was backwards in the long term and backwards in terms of being able to do stuff with the Vive you cant really do with the Rift but its technical to do so and outside most peoples understanding to do comfortably.  When compared to  incorrect BS Ive been given by Best Buy employees in the past hey will this work with technical feature abc? Yes it supports abc... get home unpack plug in turn on feature abc totally not supported at all. Id say this isnt really inaccurate for the people he is normally talking to in terms of conclusions even if not in terms of reasoning.,Vive,db884xc,5,t5_378go

9990671,0,t3_5ioesu,It depends on the game. Google Earth VR and Euro Truck Sim  dont have mirrored view for example.Unless theyve changed since I last looked at it the problem is that both Unity and Unreal have a mirrored view built in to their VR renderer and there is no easy way to switch it off. You can overlay stuff on top of the mirrored view to hide it but you cant disable it completely. So none of the games built on either of those engines can even give you the option to disable it.,Vive,db9t8pp,1,t5_378go

10035956,0,t1_dbfogd2,Completely understanding your point. Yes you can play it in single player. There are couple of options. A linear story mode this will be finished last when all the other aspects of the game is polished out takes about  minutes and gives you journey which should hopefully be a good one. Then there is another way. Playing multiplayer mission as a single player. You dont let anyone join into your room and you just play alone. It will be more challenging since you have tons of stuff to do. Controlling ballast tanks level sub trimming getting bearings from hydrophone planning attack and evade routes managing noise levels and engine speeds managing battery and oxygen dealing with damage and etc...  And then the third way. You join into multiplayer game but take a position that does not require to constantly give out orders. In our multiplayer tests we very quickly found that you can acknowledge the order by a hand gesture. We are using FinalIK the same IK technology that is being used in DeadampBuried and you can really easily give out binary signals trough body language. So if you are not a captain then theoretically you should be able to play this game without saying a word. Just give a salute whenever receiving an order. Works super well. ,Vive,dbfpmm7,6,t5_378go

10037139,0,t1_dbfst6u,Worth is relative.  What is worth  to one person may only be worth  to another.  This is why game prices typically start out high.  The developerspublishers can capture sales from the people who are willing to pay .  Then they gradually drop the price or put it on sale to capture sales from those who arent willing to pay as much.But to assume they come right out of the gate and price it cheaper is a bit silly.

Im not sure Ill like it is different from It looks amazing I want it and finding out its garbage for insert refund reason here.Demos actually have been shown to decrease game revenue as people get their fill of the experience and thats enough for many of them.All Im saying is again refunding is not a demo button and should not be treated as one.,Vive,dbg3dg8,1,t5_378go

I had more innovative ones but they were too unstable for me to put them in the demo. Im still working on the game and will be updating it soon and often.As for the trailer yes it looks better but runs like crap. Things like motion blur and depth of field looks absolutely amazing on a screen but pukedelic in the headset so theyre not an option. Then things like ambient occlusion and higher quality AA kill the FPS I shot the trailer at about  FPS overall. That being said Im working on a HUGE performance upgrade and will be adding graphics settings that way if you have a good rig you can turn all the effects back on. Ill also work on the color grading more to bring it on par with the trailer. Note that the trailer did not get any post processing outside the game besides editing and sound so reaching that stuff is definitely possible.Let me know if you have any other feedback or game ideas its always great to hear what I can improve on!,Vive,dbrhczw,2,t5_378go

You can travel through and see all the things in the human body.I believe it will be used in sports too such as in football. Coaches can walk through the line both theirs and the opposition and see which player does what and exactly how the put their feet etc. etc. Details can be observed as though they physically were walking around through the players.Just visualize the information that could be obtained. Seeing what their own players do wrong  right as well as the opposition.Probably not used on game day like the Surface tablets but more as a coaching aid.The uses for the VIVE in education are almost limitless.Chemistry teachers could lead the class on a walkthrough of the chemical reactions they are teaching about ... walking around and through the molecules as the reactions take place ... showing the students exactly how the atoms and molecules do what they do.Just as an example.

The complaint that always comes up is that it created unneeded pressure on the headset plugs but unless you are really jerking it hard it should be fine.Personally though I think anyone trying to setup these configurations is just doing it wrong. The cable is not that big of a deal Ive demoed my vive to dozens of people and no one has ever had an issue. Ive also not had any issues with the cable.

The way it works is other people could viewbot your channel same thing for Steam someone else could pay bots to write good reviews for your game.  Theyd do this if they were competition or had some sort of a personal vendetta against you so that itd take your game down.The best thing they can do is removing the dodgy reviews banning the accounts or just not letting them post reviews any more and adding some sort of a requirement for posting reviews like x amount of games owned x amount of years on steam or as other people are saying x amount of money spent on the steam store.

10167416,0,t1_dbwgee3,To be fair what they actually tried to block from not a technological but a business standpoint was the free software they were giving away to rift owners being used by nonrift owners which isnt unreasonable.  The way they went about it was overreaching even purchased games and there was no alternative to purchase yet.  The quick hack of adding the DRM was faster than fixing their store to have conditionallyfree stuff in it perhaps and when it was shown to be dangerously futile and easily circumvented they switched to the proper approach.Theres still plenty to be critical of in there  they were extremely reactionary in a businessdriven manner.  That might be either a panic response weak vision or a sign of too tight a control of the business side over the company.  Or maybe just too many controlling interests to keep happy to have the autonomy they really need  they might have felt the need to squash the image of them being undefensive of developer profit interests outweighed the competitors clients views on openness angle.,Vive,dbwj6ii,2,t5_378go

Sure it would know the position within its defined playspace but without tracking the hmd and considering the hmd will have its own defined or undefined in case of inside out tracking playspace there is no way to line them up with each other.,Vive,dbxv6ij,2,t5_378go

More maps comparable amount of weapons with more coming comparable amount of attachments tdmdmctf modes option for allteammute voice chat options for locomotion single player missions map editor blood splatters on hits targets to shoot in between spawns the ability to put mags on your person for quick reloads etc. The only feature Onward really has over BAM is the video feed of your teammates in the lobby but Id rather be able to get back into the game right away than watch that most of the time. Really the only thing similar about them is that theyre multiplayer shooters. I love Onward but these are definitely  different games.

10236590,0,t3_5mgsbw,To be honest I havent tried Soundboxing myself yet because Im too busy developing and supporting and marketing Holodance  ... I probably should and eventually will and I think its a pretty cool game that people that like rhythm games should buy.One thing Ive seen in their videos that I really like is how the orbs indicate the timing. You might miss that in Holodance but it wouldnt feel right using that approach in Holodance now that Ive seen it in Soundboxing. Other things like the replay feature while its currently not accessible to players in Holodance weve had replay even in the earliest Holodance prototypes and we have just recently started locally recording the relevant data again Also Soundboxing already has a community server which is one of the things thats not easy to get right and is still on my tasklist for Holodance. Its one of the things we obviously need to let players create and share their own native Holodance beatmaps. But well also use it for a lot of communityfeatures which is something we also need to set the ground for our multiplayer support. And it is a thing we need to have to be able to let people from SteamVive play together with people from RiftOculus Home or PlayStation VR and as such it also prepares our support for those platforms. And it lets us connect the gameplay data we record with highscore entries which is an important cheat prevention feature that highly competitive players will find necessary personally Im not a big fan of even the concept of competing but we have players that care a lot about this so this does get me excited about adding it.Holodance does have a storymode which is kind of unique  but that part of our game is also not finished yet and its actually one thing that made a lot of people completely overlook our game. Apparently not everyone is into fistbumping dragons in VR ... in a rhythm game  ... we have two recent reviews one recommending our game the other not recommending it that both fairly heavily criticize the current state of our storymode and in many aspects rightly so. Both of those players were actually interested in the storymode. So what they say means a lot to me and I care very much about addressing those issues.At the moment however my primary focus is polishing osu! support and that was a really wise decision because osu! is an incredibly awesome rhythm game and its native beatmaps osu! has osu Catch the Beat Taiko and Mania game modes as well as Catch the Beat translate very well into Holodance because they have Sliders of which Holodance was designed to have Dversion from the beginning before I had even known osu! existed ... and I called them Floating Arcs then Floating Splines both technical terms that will change  . Even then I heavily underestimated the effort that is necessary to get osu!beatmap support into Holodance and into getting it right. For example there is one Slider timing issue that I just fixed in the most recent beta after having a fairly wrong fix in the previous beta.I also had to add Spinners to Holodance to fully support the core gameplay features of osu! beatmaps and this is something Im actually considering adding to our native beatmaps as well Im not sure for the same reasons Im not adding the awesome timing indicators from Soundboxing into Holodance the main difference is that osu! is a flatscreen game and in Holodance Spinners are actually quite a different experience compared to what they feel like in osu! in osu! you rotate your mouse or a pen in Holodance you move your arm in big circles standing in front of a big wheel ... in osu! its actually increase your risk of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in Holodance its a good workout and I know one former osu! player that treats his CTS with playing Holodance among other things of course  .One thing I suggest you have a look at is our release history When Im not doing a meditation retreat Im usually working on this game more than fulltime and if you look at the credits youll probably notice that this game has been an international collaborative effort. I am working with people from Turkey England the Netherlands France Germany US Canada China India and even Russia  and that has more to do with the storymode of the game than a lot of people will probably ever realize.Also if you want to get Holodance to play osu! beatmaps its a good thing to have a look at osu! first. Its completely free and a pretty awesome game in itself. From my perspective osu! and later Stepmania support is really just a part of our game like an area that you can enter. Vanilla Holodance also stands on its own or at least it eventually will storymode being completed and our own native beatmap editor are the two big things missing there and when we get collaborative multiplayer right Holodance will define a category on its own. But we do already have some very active osu!players and as our game is Early Access they of course do shape the direction of Holodance to a certain extent most notably I am adding some competitive features which kind of complements the noncompetitive nature of Vanilla Holodance even though we did of course have leaderboards for each track right from the start.Finally we have one forum thread with osu! Beatmaps that you should try in Holodance that has a few beatmaps also listed by different genres. You should probably register at the osu! Website and look for some songs that you like to see if that will deliver what youre looking for.All that said ... if you can buy all the rhythm games currently available for VR. Its not that many and all of them are comparatively affordable depends on your income of course which depends on where youre living and what youre doing. I dont personally know or even follow all the other developers but Im fairly certain they all try their best to create awesome games and we all take a fairly great risk developing for VR. A risk I certainly feel is worth taking and I really wouldnt want to do anything else ... because ... it really is a dream I was born with Creating new realities for people to play in ,Vive,dc4dhw2,3,t5_378go

10264023,0,t1_dc7ff3n,They only launched to consumers on Windows once direct mode was in it would make sense to do the same with Linux. They have been steadily releasing beta software but theyre doing so along side a stable release that gets official support and performs very well for most users.The software isnt ready and they arent obligated to release anything until they think it works well enough for the end consumer I dont blame them SteamOS suffered on account of the OS it was based on simply not being ready to do what was asked of it at the time and Valves image took a hit along side it Id imagine they dont want to make that mistake again.Latency was acceptable for you. Not everyone is you. Sometimes it makes more sense to reach the lowest common denominator instead of releasing something that might give people a negative impression of the technology. ms isnt good enough for a lot of people and not good enough in VR means vomit. Besides treating the Vive or any VR HMD as a secondary display is hacky limits features and future expandability and isnt user friendly.

You wouldnt need an expensive k x k display per eye for high resolution VR you would only need one display with the lower resolution of the peripheral area and a small projector which could be steered to  additionally project the image for the high resolution area onto it fast enough.      In a hypothetical system with no latency the projectors resolution would only need to match the amount of pixels in the small area. In reality there would be moving parts slowing things down so you would need a bigger area to compensate if its even feasible at all.     There are probably more practical designs for a foveated display but I think this naive concept is easier to imagine than this model,Vive,dc96w3z,1,t5_378go

Where it was gonna be a space hotel but all the greed and politics killed it off.  I supported carmack being critical of greed and politics killing off innovation for humanity.

Which is nice and I am totally looking forward to trying it out. But beside of this everything is already available in different games.

Surely Shirley for a game like either one of these I would have easily have paid  though I hope they would not be as much but if thats what it takes to motivate the release of more of thesesobeeit!. Even repetitive games like these are a blast in VR when you can actually be inside a game you played in the past and suddenly you are there! Its like a childhood dream come true.

10305913,0,t1_dcc7m9v,I doubt its zero.And how is it a strange gripe to have?  Most games I have played and plan to own and want to play in the future will be requiring me to move.   VR didnt suddenly change what my left thumb is going to be doing in video games.   So all these games are doing nothing more than emulating a thumbstick in almost all cases.Even though the touchpad can perform the job... it cannot perform it with the same consistency and accuracy that a thumbstick has been providing for the past  years.   I have enough experience with a thumbstick to notice exactly where this touchpad is lacking....   Ive put in more than enough time to realize that no amount of experience with this touchpad is going to make up for the lack of having an autocentering resistance that gives proper feedback to the user as they push out from center.Youre going to stand there and tell me youve never accidently brushed that touchpad and started moving when you didnt want to or moved a little further than you wanted to?   Bullshit.  Everyone Ive seen use this pad in youtube videos even.  Their movement is not as consistent as what you notice from someone using a thumbstick.   And most of the movement that you do see coming from touchpad users looks more digital than analog.   Mostly cause you people are used to WASD than an actual analog input.  Because that is what your preference comes down to.. is your ability to bring your thumb down immediately on the edge... is it not?Im proof that a touchpad does not provide  consistent results to all users.Ive never heard of anyone making such a complaint against a thumbstick that didnt revolve around simply making the adaptation away from using WASD.  OR in the case of aiming.... bitching about aim assist vs mouse users without any assists.  But in not a single case did someone say.... I pushed on the thumbstick and my person just stood there doing nothing.  Or I went to rest my thumb on the controls... and my guy just started immediately moving without my consent.,Vive,dcc8b55,-2,t5_378go

Also the game is quite demanding graphics wise and you need supersampling of at least . imo so make sure you have at least a gtx  if not better.Its also not a story driven game no hand holding at all. You need to find your path for yourself. As a starting point I suggest you think about which of the three superpowers you would like the most lore wise and find a system in that respective superpowers region to run missions for a minor faction there. As soon as relations with that faction are cordial the mission payouts start to get much better. You might even work on a system permit that way Sol Alioth for example. Also bounty hunting in a RES can be quite fun and as long as you hand in the bounty vouchers at the stations of your minor faction itll give reputation as well so its a nice variation to mission running or trading.,Vive,dchqhw5,1,t5_378go

But I am also happy that you are considering the plugin route  both of which could I think also be combined. If you opt for open source you could start a Kickstarter campaign. Set the goal at a level which you think fairly compensates you for the work you have done and still need to do to clean up the code. If the method is as as great as you advertise the demo will be popular and you should find enough contributers including me and perhaps even ValveHTC.

10448437,0,t1_dcrw88d,I have  meter extensions from my upstairs bedroom to my downstairs living room. The only issue Ive had with that was when I first set it up I had tracking issues but that was due to USB bandwidth had all my normal peripherals plugged in which when Id previously moved the PC downstairs Id left at my desk. Solved by plugging the Vive into the front panel which is on a different controller apparently.Youll have a much easier time if you have a laptop or tablet you can use remote desktop with  otherwise youll have to run up and down especially if youre tearing down and reassembling each time.As far as easy set up it depends on your room. The lighthouses are the main issue. You can use tripods but unless you have shelves or something to put short ones on youll ideally want ones that are like  feet tall though you can get away with a bit shorter. Theyll take up a fair amount of floor space. Some people use floortoceiling tension rods. Wall mounting is ideal and the lighthouses are pretty small so if theyre up in the corners they arent too obtrusive. Especially if you can hide the power cables or unplug them when not in use.If youre set against wallmounting the other options seem to work alright but youll need to rerun room setup each time. A bit of a pain but not a huge deal. As for the rest of the system when you get used to it you can set up in a few minutes.,Vive,dcsf7ta,2,t5_378go

10517594,0,t1_dd05nbg,Yes I mean most of that.  The sensor code wasnt important really  lots of other headsets had gyro sensors already that were satisfactory. In fact  most of the original purchasers would not even have needed tracking  having their own sensors already. There is almost nothing besides the warping code that was truly useful that JC developed by that stage and that code could have been done by any decent coder and wasnt apparently used in dk anyway. Really Oculus would have gotten there in a couple of more rounds than they took. Debating later events like Dk or cv releases is just going to muddy the waters.,Vive,dd0a6k1,1,t5_378go
10520302,0,t3_5qn438,Hopefully this doesnt become a turn of the worm until VR has matured and become more mainstream.I think that developers realize that people have not only paid a considerable amount for the hardware but also a considerable sum for any upgrades they may have incurred and that this is still a market in which the audience is quite low compared to every lowpowered device in the world.At the same time I would think the developers are trying to get their work product out their get their game and studio known by paying it forward so to speak.  Perhaps some of them are funded by larger entities like HTC Oculus or Intel but there are others who might be trying to keep the lights on and the doors unlocked while others yet with spare free time are working in their parents basement I was one of those when I was living at home going to college.Some people gauge games by hours of game play and others replay value some of the most valuable and not necessarily expensive Vive games have excellent replay value both for user and inductees.  I personally value replay value in this particular medium because I believe that not many people are willing to sit strapped to a Vive as long as they are in front of a monitor unless it becomes less cumbersome.I cant quite equate the VR market to a new restaurant either where you get the most copious and delicious food at an inexpensive price only to find out three months later they cut their portions underseason their dishes and jack the price up by over .I think VR studios are trying to reap the rewards of their vision but its a slippery slope if they go that route.  If they charge too much they risk losing a sale if they charge too little it could be easily dismissed as shovelware.  I imagine its a balancing act they have to play and if wordofmouth makes their game popular then guess what happens....Well its all fine and good if you charge . for a game and  people perhaps  or  you gave keys too play and give you some great feedback.  Its another thing when you open the floodgates and perhaps you get   or even more people reporting the same issue because its one of those bugs.  This is the reason why enterprise corporations have entire divisions devoted to handling customer issues the independent developer with his firsttime game is probably looking at his inbox get a separate email hint hint like a deer in headlights.To be honest I really expected games for VR to cost more too but this is a new medium people are breaking new ground and most people dont want to shell out  for a game made by someone who is just learning even though I have done just that the best games available now are those which have been in the works by people with expert developers and artists with commensurate equipment  and funded by other source.When VR hardware and its host PC cost less to purchasemaintain and the technology becomes more mainstream which I believe it will you can expect the hardware prices to go down and the software prices for games to go up.  When I saw the full package price for Resident Evil VII on the PC no VR to be . I did a double take.I think its going to or will happen that VR will become mainstream and people will pay for quality content.  Those who are sacrificing to get what might be considered a small amount on return of investment may pay off in the long run if not a game their experience in a field in which I believe is breaking new ground.,Vive,dd0l8wl,3,t5_378go

The second game The First Encounter  other was a rerelease of their game from .  This is a full FPS shooter where you can move around and progress. For them to make this game all they needed to do was update it and increment The Last Hopes API.These developers arent scamming anyone and are currently working on new content for their game.

10525674,0,t1_dd13ihi,I can make reccommendations among some panels currently on the market but sadly articles like the one the OP refers to arent  wrong when it comes to TV display mfgrs dropping D in their newest models.  So the future for TVs is bleak which depresses me but the home projector market is strong for D.  LGs  passive D TVs are the best money can buy in my humble opinion.  What would work best would depend on pricerange and how big a space you have to put in and how close you want to sit to the display.  With D size matters but with TVs size tends to come at a premium.  Nevertheless Id recommend something from the  K LG lineup that supports passive D if you become interested.   If my current setup dies Ill likely be restricted to using a D projector.  I should have my dedicated home theater built by that time anyhow so Ill deal.,Vive,dd17773,1,t5_378go

DCS World is free to play and Id call it polished enough to be an AAA game but its also quite expensive when you consider what youll eventually want out of it and the DLC youll have to buy to get that.

For example they estimated Super Mario Run would make around m in its first month then had to downgrade that to m after it launched. More relevant was their overenthusiastic estimates for the VR market last year that when real numbers started hitting eventually lead to a bunch of stories about how the VR market was bombing because they were using Superdatas estimates as a baseline even though actual numbers were totally in line with manufacturer expectations.In other words take this all with a huge grain of salt.

Do you get the effect when just holding the vive up to your face sansstrap for instance? You might try that as uncomfortable as it might be for  minutes and seeing how that compares.FWIW Ive never met another person who has this weird pressure on the back of the neckskull thing as me so I might be way off base in thinking that might be your issue.,Vive,ddh33pt,2,t5_378go

10739676,0,t3_5tj3ky,Youve already got some answers but I suppose Ill weigh in.  I upgraded from the same CPU to an ik and I definitely do notice a difference.  In VR and regular games.  For instance Dolphin is generally better on Intel and I can play Mario Galaxy at p with no framedrops.  The game isnt that great in DolphinVR though.  And playing MarioKart  at full speed in Cemu is pretty sweet.As for VR Im getting way less skipped frames and can play Raw Data more smoothly while it kinda felt like a glitchy mess before.  Settings in Sportsbar VR can be turned up a bit more before it drops below .Im not sure if it was my CPU upgrade or if it was just patched in the meantime but I can play Time Crisis at full speed in New Retro Arcade now whereas before it was stuttery and slow.Id say the only downside is that rar and zip files seem to take longer to unpack.  But with an i that probably wont be the case. Overall I found the upgrade to be worth it.  Taking into account my impatience to wait for Ryzen and wanting to switch to Intel for a while now.,Vive,ddnpt0e,1,t5_378go

Convincing themselves that anything is great in VR? That sounds mean when I type it out.I really really wanted to love it. I followed its progress since the start and played every demo. Then I got the full game and saw that nothing had improved since the demo there was just more of it. The D assets didnt seem to gel together very well and there was an overall lack of polish in terms of the finer details and in how the world was built I think it was from modular objects off the Unity Asset Store.I dunno. It had great ideas and a vision for how it wanted to be but I couldnt get immersed when I was distracted by a lot of small things throughout. Its very cool that it was made by one guy though. I certainly couldnt imagine doing all that. Maybe it would have benefited from another team member like a D modeler.Though like uCMDRWoodsie said it might have been polished since then!

10789261,0,t3_5ua4pw,This all sounds great by why do you have to frame it against the Rift?  That makes what would otherwise be a decent speculative post come off as a bit fanboyish.  Is it not enough to just enjoy the product and be glad about how its coming along?  One product outclassing its competition by so much is actually bad for consumers.  Yes lighthouse is better than constellation but instead of shit talking the competition the idea should be that they catch up.  Valve is great HTC is fine I guess but I dont want any one company dominating the market.  Granted Valve is opening up the platform but there are still no other players yet and a market without competition quickly grows stagnant.  ,Vive,ddsu3q8,9,t5_378go

10791513,0,t1_ddsohc0,To your first point Im not sure if the lighthouse gives the oculus sensors a headache but I doubt it. I dont have both to give you an answer but I wouldnt think it would since the rift sensors are looking for the specific constellation leds that are also blinking in a specific sync pattern. To the rift sensor Id imagine the lighthouse light just looks the same as all background light like infrared coming in through the windows etc.To the second point are you suggesting trying to track the hmd with lighthouse and using the rift sensors to track the touch controllers? Why on gods green earth would you want to do that? Or since you mentioned dongles Im guessing youre thinking about hooking up a tracking puck to a touch controller. This would be fine except for the fact that the touch controllers dont have a pogo connector to talk to the tracking puck even if valve for some reason wanted to make a touch specific tracking puck  the touch controllers itself dont have a way to transmit the button presses back to the computer. I believe they work similarly to the vive wands in that they connect to the hmd for transmitting buttonsjoystick etc.In short getting touch to work with lighthouse is both problematic and beyond the technical near impossibilities no one at valve htc or oculus would devote time to solving it. Valve clearly is planning on releasing their knuckle controllers and destroying any benefit the touch has over the vive.,Vive,ddt2gy8,1,t5_378go

10815163,0,t1_ddve7zf,Also as a side topic SteamVRs d debug mode consists of the Fallback camera a few references in Hand and Teleport to the Fallback camera and some code in Hand and Teleport that handle mouse interaction.The Fallback camera isnt exactly part of the interaction system and doesnt make any references to the rest of Valves interaction system scripts. The mouse interaction in Hand and Teleport is done entirely with Unitys standard mouse button and screen raycasting.So technically we could add both a Is D fallback method to sdks that returns true in the simulator SDK and in Steam VR returns a boolean dependent on whether the d debug mode  fallback camera is in use and mouse interactions in that mode to the some of the interactable  grabbable  teleport scripts. And then VRTKs objects would work in the same d debug mode.Of course whether thats useful or not is a debatable question. Because Steam VRs d fallback cannot handle a pile of basic things like objects that attach to the controller and might can be used. Or controller interactions like radial menus touchpad inputs and other buttons.,Vive,ddviaid,2,t5_378go

I strongly recommend you get the vive the feeling of space and scale you get youll never be able to get through a regular screen your best option is to work on Revit or export to sketch up so you can use a tool called prospect by irisVR the basic version its free and you can work on your design and visualize it in VR with a couple of clicks.Open your model in  scale yes its true to scale see something you dont like?

Of course but pretending that theyre putting the same amount of work in adding VR as they do for the whole game or even an individual DLC  creating the content from the ground up. That doesnt seem incredibly likely to me.That said I know Bethesda are reasonable. As ready as everyone here might be to plonk down  on a game theyve already paid for just to add VR to it  Bethesda have always been great about their upgrades.

10882443,1,t1_de2dqz2, agree. I love that the Steam controller can emulate mouse based games but trackpads are super annoying for just about anything else. Trying to play Fallout  with it has been a huge hassle. There are a handful of interactions in VR where I prefer a trackpad but usually Im wishing for an analogue stick. Analogue sticks have their drawbacks as well but theyre great for locomotion which is like  of what I use the trackpad for.   Valve is under the impression that people will prefer trackpads when they get used to them but I dont get why they have to reinvent the wheel when analogue sticks work better for the most common interactions. New users and non gamers always have more trouble with the trackpads compared to sticks as well.   Trackpads jack of all trades master of none. Theyre definitely survivable its a minor gripe but I hope Valve eventually gives up on them.,Vive,de2g38q,2,t5_378go

If you did a fps like BAM or onwards then u would have to change the locomotion system.  Because obviously if you were using a track pad you wouldnt want to drop the controller do a hand gesture and then grab the controller again.

10936247,0,t1_de7xgy7,I am a little confused on the new headsets that are being made for Windows  VR. As one article statesgt The headmounted displays work like HoloLens allowing users to interact with D objects that show up as floating images on realworld backgrounds. Like Oculus Rift users can also watch movies use apps play games in D with the headset. This suggest that the new HMDs will have AR capability like Microsoft HoloLens.This article however suggestgt It is clear that the new VR headset line is different from the Microsoft HoloLens which is an augmented reality technology that brings virtual objects into the real world. The VR headsets works more like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive among others. What sets the line apart from most competing VR gears however is that all the headsets are outfitted with insideout tracking sensors.So I am unsure if these HMDs are AR VR or both. Anyway they are supposedly going to be shown off more at GDC in a few days with devkits releasing then and hitting the consumer market later this year.gt Microsoft isnt expected to sell Windows  VR headsets commercially. Those will be available later this year through companies Lenovo Acer Asus HP Dell and Glasses which demonstrated headsets at the CES trade show earlier this month. ,Vive,de7zwh8,1,t5_378go

10948687,0,t3_5wc6mw,The little bit of Pavlov Ive played has been fairly enjoyable but am I wrong in feeling like something is wonky with the TTK?  Or maybe its a netcode thing?  I find its easy enough securing quick kills with the sniper rifle or shotgun but with a lot of the automatic weapons I feel like I cant get kills half the time even after emptying half a mag straight into an enemys center of mass.That aside Pavlov does have potential but its one of those things where Im worried about how lively the player base is gonna be.  For instance Onward with its immense praise fandom and media coverage only sports ish players during peak hours.  Then you look at something like BAM which has no more than around  players during weekend peaks despite it decidedly being the  shooter at least in popularity behind Onward.Im a happy owner of both those games but with how modest the multiplayer community currently is for even the highestregarded VR shooters Im unsure if Pavlov does enough things notably betterdifferent than BAM and Onward for it to carve out a slice of that very limited pie.,Vive,de9a2ps,2,t5_378go

10973869,0,t1_debunx3,Personal preference is fine and all. But what James said isnt wrong. And I think it was understandable for Facebook to say something like roomscale is cool but we dont feel necessary for Vr when I believe most people who have it think it completely makes most Vr experiences. There is nothing much else like it and valve have done it really well. Also on wireless VR Gabe Newell has already said Wireless is a solved problem at this point indicating that he has seen the technology for himself and it is extremely promising with almost no quality drawbacks. Source  While the oculus controllers possibly have some upsides to the vive controllersoverall in comfort and feeling like a hand Valve is already working on their new knuckle controllers and has been putting a lot of time in to refine them with feedback from other software developers.Personally when it comes down to Valves Wireless VR controller development designing better headstraps than their first ones and coming out with the Vive puck accessories which would be much much much harder for a visual based tracking system like oculuss to support I feel like valve is the one really pushing technologies forward right now at a visible and exciting rate. Where as the most news I have seen from roculus for a while was complaints about their tracking quality which if you see some of the issues was very very bad. Now that their . software is out I think they fixed most of their issues but it still has slight shimmers here and there I hear. Honestly I dont think Facebook would have said that Wireless Vr is compressed not perfect and expensive if they simply werent behind the competition of a company that has already said Wireless is a solved problem at this point.,Vive,debwazm,10,t5_378go

10989674,0,t3_5wxtyy,Hah I know how you feel  when are the full games coming if at all? The same thing could be said for steam games in general these days but hey  were partly to blame for this ourselves we cant wait  the devs. need money to finance their gaming dreams and were willing to pay for earlyrelease games. I think the last  games I bought on Steam are ALL early Alpha and Beta games but I am fine with that  it is my choice to do so and my money to play with so my fault for accepting that or believing in the devs. enough to support them choose what suits you best.But Id like to correct you a little there are several HTC Vive titles that I personally consider full games. For example one of my favorite arcade shootups Xortex it has an option to play endless on the leaderboards its surely bullet hell and a heck of a work out  and a shining star example how to make a super hefty D VR arcade game that would be worthy of any coinop machine IMHO. I still play it till today!There are others such as Space Pirate Trainer. Its not a complex game but imho  done...you cant do so much more in the genre it was made for maybe take a flight in the spaceship thats behind you but...that introduces the possibility for motion sickness and makes it an entirely different game.One of the good thing about games that arent totally finished  is that you always have the element of surprise and the possibility of getting more bang  for your buck.One good example of this is Ark. I was one of those who purchased it early on and sure..there were a lot of discussion about the devs. not finishing it but holy smokes...it has grown to be a BEAST of a game and I cant say I know of any other games that looks this gorgeous and this HUGE despite its shortcomings here and there. All the anger behind ArkPark being released separately I cant see it  its two different games.Well downvote if it makes you feel better but I just had to say it If you think the games stink  youre more than welcome to start developing your own more than excellent tools even for the beginner is right at hand with eg. unity and the free VR toolkit I played it with myself and made a simple game in  hours of course  it is so simple and stupid that I wouldnt release it in a gazillion years  but if you  have the time there is really no excuse to not get your hands dirty in VR land!

Making games for VR will take a while to get going as devs start to figure out the little tips and tricks in coding that will make it go faster. Devs today already know the best ways to do things cause theyve been doing it for years. VR is a whole different things entirely and it will likely take time. I think well start seeing better games around mid to late  with reall AAA games coming more like  assuming theyll rush and have already started working on them,Vive,dedr961,2,t5_378go

10991377,0,t1_deds9sf,Are you seriously comparing light weight hybrid fresnel lenses to simple lenses in a  phone based HMD?  Custom lenses are not cheap and Mechanicals says Plastics metals hardware misc. its a catchall when the lenses should have their own line item. Theyre impossible to value though as they are custom. It doesnt even matter though because component cost is only a small part of the total cost of creating marketing delivering and supporting a high end retail consumer product. You have to remember that you need to count in high cost RMAs the labor of putting the product together the labor of designing and testing it the labor of marketing it the cost of demo booths and demo units and free developer kits the cost of the custom software stack the cost of bundled games and applications the cost of fixing bugs and providing technical support the cost of creating development tools and the SDK the cost of shipping all your parts the cost of even deciding on the parts shipping the final product to retailers and dont forget the retailers cut. Its extremely naive to say they are lying about selling at cost when there are so many additional costs we cannot possibly compute.   Hardware margins are traditionally extremely thin. The galaxy S BOM is estimated at  by this same company and it retails at . Despite the fact that its a mature industry Samsung is a market leader and has made millions of phones they still only actually eke out a    operating margin every year. Most other cell phone manufacturers have even thinner margins. I would put significant money on Oculus losing money on each Rift sold PS style especially with the low volume compared to cell phone production runs in the millions. Over time as manufacturing becomes more efficient and the market grows that will change.,Vive,dedu64d,5,t5_378go

11088755,1,t1_deovdpc,My position prior to Trump was that CNN is just lazy attentionseeking entertainment pretending to be the news. Theyd bring on astrophysicists to find out if the missing Malaysian airliner had been sucked into a black hole. Theyre not liberals theyre not conservatives theyre just dumb and crass.That was before Trump mind you. Thats the CNN that John Stewart and Stephen Colbert made fun of every night for years. Youd listen to Washington insiders talk about the media democrats or republicans and the complaints would be the same if theres a genocide in an African country and someone trips at the Oscars on the same day the Oscars story always leads. Its why so many producers abandoned CNN to go work for The Daily Show where the stories theyd run down could lead over meaningless fluff. Trump is changing that now. The media is waking up to the realization that their reputation credibility and freedom may be at stake if they dont radically change course and become substantive first. The change is slow at least in TV news but its coming. ,Vive,deowfny,6,t5_378go

11099684,0,t3_5yg02k,I kinda have to scoff at standing. Trust me you WILL NOT stay in one place. The chaperone seeming to move around on its own isnt the base stations drifting its the other way around you moving without realizing it. If you dont have the space for room scale grab a swivel chair. Trust me.Being able to swing at shoulder level without hitting anything isnt a very good test. In fact extending your arms in opposite directions is usually a bad idea regardless of the size of your space. You very definitely wont keep your hands at shoulder level and again you very definitely wont stay in the center without an unreasonable amount of practice. You will need to get used to repositioning yourself so theres room in front  to the side of you to extend your arms. Floor bounds always on makes good training wheels for this a less obtrusive option is using the center marker from OpenVR Advanced Settings. At x you almost certainly dont have enough room to simply keep returning to the center so be conscious of this until it becomes natural.If a game supports both standing and room scale what room scale gets you over standing is being able to make fine adjustments to your position quickly by physically moving. This is more useful than it sounds  crucial for dodging things. Its also safer as its much more clearly marked where strikeable obstacles are in your play space.,Vive,deq51ah,1,t5_378go

11197870,0,t1_df1983l,Well its a mix because the FOV is only tunneled when moving and as soon as you stop it opens up again really fast so you still get immersion. I mean to some it might ruin it but for those that get sick fast its a far cry better than A feeling sick after a few minutes and B being stuck with slow and clunking teleport mechanics. The walking in place also help the illusion too. Mind you my legs are rubber now but I dont mind that in an experience or game that was more simulation and slower like Onward or exploration.I think it might be a step in the right direction to get more parity in locomotion options. Teleport was great but I cant complete using it in a game of BAM VR while trackpad users are strafing circles around me lol.The walkingrunning in place was a blast too. I didnt think Id like that but boy. We need stuff like this in Shooters. It would make it more challenging so users arent floating at crazy speeds. Its all more natural movement paces etc.,Vive,df19jvv,3,t5_378go
11200901,0,t1_df1emoh,I totally agree. But looking into the future we need more games then ED and Star Citizen. Specially with VR support. So I applaud them. I dont know if I want to play a game with HARD SCIENCE though. That seems like it would be boring. ,Vive,df1lwhk,1,t5_378go
11201537,0,t1_df14u9b,I used to have many problems with the Rift but now with the latest updates its working perfectly.  I definitely would NOT recommend getting a second hand Rift or Vive.You dont need the front facing camera on the Rift as it has a large nose gap.  Whilst this might seem like a disadvantage on first impressions it actually solves  problems  it lets you see your keyboard and navigate around your room and allows for adequate ventilation which prevents fogging and condensation build up I havent heard of any Rifts getting sweat damaged yet.  There are a few situations where youd want a Vive over a Rift though.  . If you wear glasses these tend to fit better in a Vive. If you have a space larger than .m x .m and want to take advantage of it. Your head shape seriously disagrees with the Rift but is fine with the Vive.,Vive,df1ohot,2,t5_378go
11203150,0,t1_df1u4k6,Yup. Oculus is fronting all the financial risk to get the VR devs going. I doubt the way the deal was structured had any financial risk on Epic.

11272287,0,t1_df9emcm,Thats very... biased to say the least.  True fov is bigger but at the cost os the sweetspot size. Oculus offers better clarity. Tracking is better because it only requires two Base stations to work setting it up is a bit less of the hassle. By that too comes at price lighthouses are expensive and easy to break. Due to the inner vibrations you cant use adhesives or tripods to mount them reliably. Oculus consumers are free to buy software from wherever they want. Most games are available Steam. Cameras are not easily accessible. The guy who accessed them needed to boot into Linux and not use oculus drivers. Accessing them remotely and without breaching other safeties is really not that likely besides at that point you should probably worry about your data than the pic of your room. About Facebook true. Its up to personal believes.One in all its not black and white. Both headsets have advantages and flaws. Vive is better in some aspects but is it  or  when including price of rd sensor better?

11313115,0,t1_dfdduij,First of all the discussion about the numbers of player isnt something to agree or disagree on as they are factual numbers listed at vrlfg.netIn your post above you strongly claimed that everything yrah posted was wrong and nothing backs up his statement. Usually I agree as he is one of the most toxic aggressive and generally hateful redditors here in this subreddit who rages against various things hates the Vive hates VRTK hates UE hates womens rights etc and I have called him out a few times on those matters.HOWEVER there are still some truthful facts in his post that shouldnt be handwaved. For me the truth is important regardless of what topic were currently discussing. You asked for some proof or some backing of those statements and I provided some.Fact  the player base at the time of his post was in fact at  or shortly thereafter at  player onlineFact  the dev and a few users posting about BAM have been banned here in this subreddit for vote manipulationvote brigading if that ban was justified or not is a whole different discussion that should been discussed with the mods not with meI didnt like the way you made a blanket statement about yrah similarly how yrah made a blanket statement about BAM. And now youre accusing me of swallowing a narrative being gullible and you are generally very dismissive of my post. Dont you see how that makes you seem overzealous?If you were genuinely interested in both sides of the story regarding the ban then you should also give the mods the benefit of doubt. They rarely permaban anyone here without good reason. I have been banned myself once by them but after a good discussion with the head mod the ban got removed and he always seemed very reasonable and open to reasonable discussion. To use the same argument as you do you are also willingly accepting the devs narrative without knowing what the mods know.Also my post had NOTHING about which game is better or not and almost your whole reply addresses how BAM is a good game and I should give it a chance. I dont care which game succeeds and only got Pavlov to check out another UE game. If you feel so strongly about this game consider not to be overly defensive about your favorite game. I only played the demo for a bit but you have turned me off the game for good if the people here are representative of the bigger BAM community just look at what some of the BAM fans are posting! and how inflammatory their posts become  ,Vive,dfebo16,1,t5_378go

11397133,0,t1_dfn6pe2,E Id misconstrued what uPrAyTeLLa was saying. He was talking about Oculus poaching from Valve not any possible sketchy actions on Valves part. He better explains heregt Oh and the same thing happened with Valve like exactly the same to the point of stealing staff.Thats misrepresenting the truth quite a bit. Newell had been trying to recruit Michael Abrash since at least and probably well before  years before the Zenimax buyout and his motivations were more general having good history from their Microsoft days Abrash joining id was actually the inspiration for Newell and Harrington to leave Microsoft and found Valve and an obvious common interest in building games.Source On a related note Oculus stealing staff wasnt limited to id.

11479190,0,t1_dfx4vnz,yeah I understand the hard work that you guys put into this and thats awesome keep doing it but at the same time you have to put yourself in the shoes of the consumer.    If Im a consumer I go to your steam page and see  reviews for a mixed score.  I see the price tag of .  I go to SteamCharts and see that  person is playing every couple of days.  What are the chances that the consumer is realistically going to spend  to play with one other guy just because he sees that youre working hard?  A consumer can appreciate the amount of work that you do but it doesnt realistically make sense for them to spend  to play in empty lobbies...    Again not trying to come off rude but there needs to be a decent player count in a game for people to really consider making the plunge to spend .  I definitely agree that a free weekend is a fantastic idea to help build the player base but I think the price needs to be put into consideration as well.  For example the Bam vs Pavlov discussion has been very heated these last couple weeks Bam is clearly a more polished game with more maps gamemodes guns and customization BUT according to steam charts has a varied playerbase ranging from  to  on a given day and time but Pavlov has anywhere between  and  but why?  Bam is clearly the better game in every way shape and form but Pavlov is succeeding way more.  If you follow the discussions as to why it comes down to one thing price.    But please dont take this as me telling you how to run your game thats really disrespectful of me.  Instead I hope you understand that Im speaking strictly from a consumers point of view and based off what has been said and what the numbers say about Bam vs Pavlov.  ,Vive,dfx5v9b,12,t5_378go

I dont really care if I receive copies of the phone version console version or Telltales adventure game adaptation  which could also be argued to be a version of minecraft. I want to make it clear to you that Im not the guy demanding Notch give me all his MampMs Im your analogy. I tried MampMs for a while and grew tired of them. That said I entered this conversation merely to point out that that promise was not kept even for people who bought the game before it was removed. Would that hold up in a court of law?

I definitely could be wrong.  right now were kind of in a chickenandegg problem.  widespread adoption requires a suite of killer apps but studios are hesitant to dedicate resources to making fullscale games until they see the market expanding.  VR headsets speaking of rift and vive sold somewhere between k and . million units depending on who you ask.  whereas the PSVR has sold as many units as both put together or possibly slightly more.  so lets say  million units total.  the failed sega dreamcast sold . million units.  if youre a project manager at EA or Blizzard or Ubisoft its hard to pitch to your boss we could sell  million copies of a VRonly game vs we could make a multiplatform nonVR game like BF and sell  million copies of it.  granted BF was a huge success for them but it would have been literally impossible to sell that many copies to the VR market as it currently stands.  so it will be an iterative process.  companies are going to dip their foot in make some money and then dip their foot in a little deeper until theyre up to their neck but it will take a few years.  It might end up being gen  before it is fully realized.  ,Vive,dgqfar1,2,t5_378go

For some reason a lot of people will claim you cant see any improvement above . supersampling which I never could understand because I find if you are using SteamVRs desktop mirror compositor ss at . is the absolute minimum for an acceptable experience.  In general its a casetocase matter dependent on how each title renders and antialiases things as well as how its assets are designed and presented and how they are perceived by the player. At the bottom of the performance section of the SteamVR desktopside settings window there is a button called show frame timing which will open a graph window that displays a running log of your frame times. It in turn has a checkbox that makes the same graph appear inHMD attached to the wrist of one of your Vive controllers. Just mess around with quality and ss settings until you both think the result looks good and can manage to not allow the graph to go above ms which is your max target for the fps of the HMD. Reprojection will smooth over intermittent spikes as best it can  how well this suffices depends on the title speeds camera movement and amount of animation as well as how sensitive each player is to glitches.BTW. One SteamVR beta had an optimised filtering method for its distortion shader which did more averaging of supersampled pixels than the previous and current. It was reverted because many users complained about blurry output but will unless other solutions are found return as an option in the future.,Vive,dgt5xxj,1,t5_378go

11779351,0,t1_dgv5ggz,Its very promising game but right now I cant really play it because of bad performance. My pc runs every other vr game perfectly just not this one i also cant find any in game settings. Is there an external config file I could use?
