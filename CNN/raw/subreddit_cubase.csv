671619,0,t1_cggjr8m,I bring a  space rack with my Motu  MKIII and my macbookpro read more about it hereAs for hiccups I dont worry. If it fails we can just stop the session and i can make my own changes and the drummer would just not ply to a click. I have all the samples and tracks on my kronos as well so if i have to play them theyre a key press away.,cubase,cggm251,1,t5_2rqj8
1156586,0,t1_chzl6nn,yeah Rokmans video above solved the problem. you have to select another output channel in the omnisphere mixer as well.,cubase,chzqdlb,1,t5_2rqj8

6300756,0,t1_cz5dlwk,Thanks for the reply.That makes sense as Im using p resolution. Ill try your suggestion and see what happens.Im glad Steinberg are on the case... Its pretty frustrating having these bugsissues yet they are not fixed when they release a paid update to ..I wonder why it wasnt an issue in ..?,cubase,cz5tp5q,1,t5_2rqj8

6731592,0,t1_d0flc5k,No worries! I will just add it to my list of requests  Yup Im maxing out the meter fairly often. Disabling a plugin while Cubase is playing pretty much trips the meter each time as do a few similar things.,cubase,d0flted,1,t5_2rqj8

7023031,0,t1_d1av69k,I use Elements and can confirm that it does include tempo track functionality. The shortcut is actually CtrlT as AltT is the MediaBay shortcut.,cubase,d1ceuik,2,t5_2rqj8
7248785,0,t1_d21ca3n,It doesnt matter if you dont have the money you dont get the software. You dont have the right to whatever you want someone worked hard. Find a way to save money or dont get it but dont run around online trying to scam people into giving you theirs. ,cubase,d224vym,1,t5_2rqj8
7546846,0,t1_d2vsg2g,Thanks for the input  I do work a lot with MIDI hence why I was probably suggested Cubase. ,cubase,d301fxn,1,t5_2rqj8
7567686,0,t1_d2vq7hz,Agreed.  Protools is tremendously robust and easy for audio but where writing and midi go Id choose Cubase over it any day.  Its ability to manipulate midi the tempo mapper retrospective record and the detect midi tempo etc are un indespensible.However finishing to protools is a must and Cubases OMF functionality is severlely underdeveloped.  Logics and DPs otoh are very robust.  Steinberg needs to figure that out.,cubase,d32eqon,1,t5_2rqj8
7861472,0,t1_d3zi5pz, is considered a compound meter along with    and so on. Compound meters are conducted in sets of three so  is conducted the same way as  which serves to distinguish it from .,cubase,d3zp85m,3,t5_2rqj8

9254192,0,t1_d8oqn9b,Maybe try freezing some of your VSTs. Seems with all that it can be eating a lot of RAM and CPU.,cubase,d8p1ad6,1,t5_2rqj8

10837046,0,t1_ddxhtur,Ya. Im trying to run the keyboard as an audio track.the ASIO driver I guess I dont have one? When I ordered the Alesis IO it came with a download code for Cubase and I dont think anything else was in it.,cubase,ddxrj9f,1,t5_2rqj8
11598522,0,t3_65j5fi,Do you mean editing velocity or other peramaters?If you mean what I think you mean you should be dwlrawing your automation in the panel under the piano roll.Like this,cubase,dgap8xv,1,t5_2rqj8
