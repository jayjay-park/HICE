5228686,0,t3_3mh7c7,Does your company help you with the relocation? those kind of question will be answered by the relocation contractor iI guess. Anyway welcome to KL I also just moved in to KL  years ago answer below based on my experience other may varies. which banks for Local Banks Maybank and CIMB have good coverage can find ATM easily especially if you are reside in city center. If you have transaction overseas HSBC is also one of good option for you. Remember you cannot withdraw USD from ATM here or other overseas currency altough you have USD account. You need to convert it to MYR first.  mobile carriers Maxis is the biggest provider here in Malaysia.  Where to live I suggest find area depend on wheres your office. Here the subwayLRT is not that bad but expect pack full of people during rush hours. Road traffic in the city center and surrounding area is sucks during rush hour. If youre single and your office near city center maybe find a place near city center rent is damn high or somewhere  LRT station nearby such as Setiawangsa area. Other than that just googling KL is one of main hub for expatriate so should be a lot of post about it,KualaLumpur,cvg8xhz,1,t5_2utt8
