AG Who do you read now among American writers? The album was reissued in  with  bonus remixes.  Thanksgiving Prayer Drugstore Cowboyand Even Cowgirls Get the Blues.Now so I say take a walk around the block come back and put what you have seen on canvas. You have seen fragments. Youve seen a man cut in half by a car youve seen reflections in the shop windows. AG Uhhuh and youve seen your own thoughts if you daydreamed also. WSB Yes of course and how they intersect with reality. Burroughs described it as not a very distinguished work. An excerpt of this work in which Burroughs and Kerouac wrote alternating chapters was finally published in Word Virus a compendium of William Burroughs s writing that was published by his biographer after his death in . Before Vollmer died Burroughs had largely completed his first novel Junkie which was written at the urging of Allen Ginsberg who was instrumental in getting the work published even as a cheap massmarket paperback. Ace Books published the novel in  as part of an Ace Double under the pen name William Lee retitling it Junkie Confessions of an Unredeemed Drug Addict it was later republished as Junkie then in  as Junky and finally in  as Junky the definitive text of Junk edited by Oliver Harris .Burroughs was cited by Robert Anton Wilson as the first person to notice the  Enigma  Burroughs appears on the cover of The Beatles eighth studio album Sgt. Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Burroughs participated on numerous album releases by Giorno Poetry Systems including The Nova Convention featuring Frank Zappa John Cage and Philip Glass and You re the Guy I Want to Share My Money With with John Giorno and Laurie Anderson.
