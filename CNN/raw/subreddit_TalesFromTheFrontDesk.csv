443552,0,t1_cfqpz1l,Of course  and I agree.But I do believe that the customer should be asking themselves certain questions.. Were my expectations met?. Were my expectations exceeded at all?. Did the serviceproduct match the value? i.e. money paid. Do I understand the terms and conditions and the nature of business?If you own or work for a private or independent hotel free from a brand chain then you have to make sacrifices. Even if you work for a large chain but you are at a struggling site you will have to do the same thing. You must extend a greater service to the customer and you must work hard to keep them there.However you should not tolerate any kind of unnecessary or unreasonable demand or any kind of abbrasive or challenging behaviour. You do not owe the customer anything beyond the required service at the quality advertised. Anything above and beyond is extra albeit part of the job but waiving terms and conditions and losing money through uncancelled bookings because a guest thinks they have spent enough time and money over an extended period at your hotel warrants special treatment is unfair on the business. Particularly if said guest is exaggerating and does very little to benefit the business.I get your point and Im struggling to articulate a response because I painfully agree with you yet also disagree. Its a frustrating situation.,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,cfqqm85,2,t5_2wlcx

If theres no difference then just tell them the truth.The only reason we like to know how many is so we can get an accurate count of heads in beds for stuff like breakfast in the morning and how many housekeepers we need.

Then he said hed appreciate if any friends call back to please patch them through to the room immediately.  Of course we promised to but no one called. My coworker called his room to ask if there was anything he needed or if between checkins hed like it if she called to chat with him.   He said again hed just really appreciate if we transfer his friends to the room immediately when they call.During shift exchange my coworker brought me up to date on the notes and put an emphasis on her conversations with the upset male guest.   I began calling the room myself no one answered.I didnt get far into my shiftwork when the guest forced the window past the safety latch to fully open it then jumped.I didnt hear his collision w the ground but the commotion from other guests is hard to forget.

2794767,0,t3_2s2nmn,I run a small town older hotel and for the most part the clients are pretty good and dont have too many complaints but the ones that I do get are usually of the things that make you go hmmm variety.Anyways being as its an older building our electrical capacity isnt exactly stellar so we have a strict policy regarding no microwaves or other cooking appliances in the rooms.  Our one client was a younger man working on a drilling rig nearby and had been staying with us for about a month already and knew he could use the microwave downstairs if he needed to.  That morning housekeeping had found a microwave box in the hallway and a DND sign up on his room which was normal for his shift and was unresponsive to repeated callsknocking to see if he had one.That night I finally get a call back from him complaining that the breaker for his room blew.  Upon switching it out it blew again.  I told him that I was going to check the downstairs main power switches and went to do so.  At this time he comes downstairs and complains to my wife about the breaker issue... with two pizza pops in his hands halfcooked and denying to her about the microwave box.  Evidently he must have thought that people get dumber with age and we wouldnt be able to put two and two together.So that night the microwave was removed.  The next night same problem but this time he had figured that he outsmarted us by keeping the box in the room.  Needless to say he wasnt impressed when we noknocked our way in and removed the second one while he was in the room.  At this point we had to tell him to find another place to stay.  He gets his rig manager on the phone trying to get him to force his case.  Upon explaining the situation to him the rig manager apologised for his worker being an idiot guaranteed pay for the rest of the week for the room and ensured that this kid would not be working on a noncamp rig any more as this was the second hotel in the area he had been evicted from.,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,cnlr69u,9,t5_2wlcx

It just wouldnt be worth it for them.If your work performance is otherwise on point just keep doing what you do. If you havent already implemented the would you like to enroll spiel into your checkin dialog then add it.

You not only have to know Opera but Reserve Flex Passkey and one other one I believe. Of course these vary by property but youll have to know a whole mess of systems and Opera is probably the easiest youll learn. Youll have to be able to make quick and blanket changes to large groups and do those on the spot. You work closely with your sales team too. Which can be frustrating when they contract say  double rooms when you only have  on property. So now you have an upset leader that was basically lied to and is now understandably pissed that their guests will be uncomfortable while staying.Im not saying dont try it. I just dont want you going in thinking itll be easier than fd. Sure itll be . Your customer service has to be  better than at fd though. At least if you were and agent.

The policy is written out clearly for the guest to read and then they have to sign at the bottom with their name room number and list each person up to a maximum of  people no more are allowed in the room they would like to register as a guest.

5698848,0,t1_cx3d5yd,Absolutely agree. The lifestyle and signature brands are where the merger is going to get interesting. I definitely think that the starwood lifestyle brands are much better branded overall. Renaissance are a bit unique in the Marriott world since they are a separate company type deal like RitzCarlton. The concept of a Renaissance hotel is really cool but they are very rarely executed appropriately. What I could see happening is having the big hotels where one is branded a Marquis and one is branded a Marriott? Or really determining a price pointbrand differentiation between Marriott SIgnatureMarquis versus Sheratons. Maybe try and capture a slightly more expensive market with one and a more discounted market with the other? Itll be difficult and theyre definitely not going to want to lose the revenue that a big box hotel will bring. I definitely agree that the brand differentiation is going to be key. I actually think Marriott does a pretty good job or are starting to of letting you know WHAT brand is for what. It just took them forever to catch up with the trends with brands like Moxy and Edition. Itll be interesting to see if they abandon those concepts and shift them into a slot that Starwood has already filled. There are currently  brands within Marriott and many more will really just be unsustainable for a branding and marketing perspective IMO.

We werent even allowed to talk about it in the staff room and ESPECIALLY not mention it in front of new people but of course we did.Eventually I found out though everyone had their stories.

8012794,0,t3_4ovg8q,Unfortunately there is a lot of turnover in the hospitality industry in general. Most people see it as a temporary job until they find something better that pays more. At least that is my take on the subject. BUT I think the management team has so much to do with it as well because when you see loyal employees who have been there a while leave you know something is up. Also the case when there is a serious amount of turnover... My new coworker also works at a restaurant pretty big one in fact and just last week they had  servers quit... I really wanted to comment because I really wanted to share my experience at my current property. The company I work for has pushed out a lot of good loyal employees  by promoting people who have little to no experience in that particular area over them... And also proving that going to college for Hospitality is pointless as shit  which I did and can agree on Last summer they brought in someone to our hotel who had a boat load of experience and was probably one of the best. They also went to school for this and were looking to advance in this career. They were given a lead position like they had at their previous property Sadly they werent given any guidelines or responsibilities for the position... They continued to ask what the position entailed and what they were supposed to be doing but were not given any answer... They have since left and had taken a position at their old property as a front desk manager... Well before they came to our property we had another FD person working for us also went to school for HRM... We started at the same time and they basically walked them in to getting a management position and made them the lead with in the first year... Well our then GM was leaving to go work for another one of our companys properties and instead of promoting FD agent they left things unclear... FD agent then went to work for another one of our  properties as AGM... Which they then promoted our current AGM to our property... Who had little to no FD experience and who had a bad habit of disciplining employees in front of guests... Who also wants to be strict on uniform policy but will come in wearing tshirts... I also trained them by the way... Needless to say we have gotten in to it a couple of times because AGM wont own up to their mistakes and wants to blame everyone else for them... Just this summer they decided to have a FD Supervisor on staff... my hotel went behind everyones back to give my one coworker this position... They are terrible when it comes to guest interactions and is constantly making mistakes. Our current GM was promoted from being AGm and while I think that was a wise choice at the time they have since become a terrible GM... Always coming in late and always leaving early and never property disciplining anyone...Oh and my first coworker who took AGM position at other property is now out if hotels entirely BTW...As for me I have been seriously looking outside hotels to find another job as I am really sick of how my company operates and I feel like it is the same no matter where you go... I am not the only one looking to leave. There are several people on my staff who are fed up with how things are going and cant wait to get out of here...I stayed as long as I did because I was hoping to get promoted at another property but not going to happen any time soon...

Ill run the card to auth for RampTINC and youre bank is going to put a hold on these funds.  Because debit cards are essentially virtually cash it will look like a charge howecer It doesnt go to our pocket its not in your pocket its set aside on standby by your bank because its promised money.  You will not have access to these funds.If you dont use the incidential the auth will drop and depending on your bank it can take  business days for funds to return to your account.

11008039,0,t3_5x1yo5,Worst group Ive ever dealt with A Jehovahs Witness church group that stayed with us two years in a row. It was at least  years ago that I last dealt with these people and still to this day I have never had a worse group of people. This was a MASSIVE group for my  room hotel that is  Full busloads full of people.   per room and each room was being paid for separately.  So once the bus arrives Ive got  rooms to check in independently all by myself with the lobby packed full beyond fire code and a line trailing far into the parking lot. As Im checking each room in one by one the people from rooms Ive already checked in start calling the desk requesting that things be brought to them. As Ive just checked them in they could surely see that it is only me here and Ive still got  plus rooms to check in with the people who are waiting being very impatient but they dont give a damn they need  extra towels right now so they can shower. About half the group checked in and about  calls for requests or complaints that I could yet do anything about a woman comes to the front desk pushes past the remaining crown waiting to check in and is holding the bottom panel from the mini fridge in her room and complaining that it has mold on it and is a health hazard. Thats right folks this woman disassembled her micro fridge this piece required unscrewing it from the assembly and had to have needed some good prying force to removeNearly every single person I had checked in so far had something negative to say about the initial appearance of the hotel the area the weather anything they could come up with to complain about while only having experienced the lobby so far they did.  So now heres this woman with her disassembled panel that shes yelling is a health hazard while Ive still go so many check ins to get through.  I think I sort of snapped in that moment.  I put on my most concerned looking face and looking at the totally fine inner panel with one tiny black dot that on it that definitely was not mold agreed that it was absolutely unacceptable and I will fix this right now. I then took it into the back laundry room that is attached to the desk area and took an extremely leisurely long time giving it the most thorough clean possible before bringing it in its sparkly white glory back to her. I took great pleasure seeing the lobby full of extremely impatient people all giving her the most hateful stink eye Id seen in some time. This group stayed  days each time and I dont believe Ive ever received so many complaints before or since. Worst individual type of guests  drunks who are late walkins mid summer when we are sold out.  ,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,defqb0q,6,t5_2wlcx

The AGM did and was too busy talking and hanging out with her cousin who owned the Chipotle next door and giving shit attitudes to customers while she had me in the back scrubbing dishes I was the cashier.

I stop working with these people as its not worth the hassle regardless if give then a decent discount or charge full rate. They are going to slam you with a negative review haggle for more discounts in the morning for the  page list of complaints they couldnt be bothered to bring up until checkout and I feel better telling them to usually drive another hour and probably spending the same anyway.,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,dgxsnq9,15,t5_2wlcx

I told her Ive cancelled your room due to a non valid card on file. If you want room you can show up with a VALID cc we can charge for your stay we accept cash but Im not putting up with her bringing another empty card. Its one call my GM doesnt quite know about haha,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,dgy1fl3,2,t5_2wlcx
