2254125,0,t3_2iholv,The size requirement was not intended as a hard and fast rule. It was mainly there to encourage people to build designs rather than small parks. If I feel like an entry has an advantage due to its size Ill disqualify it but most of what we have received so far should be alright.If anyone competing feels like another members map size gives them an advantage PM me and Ill do something about it.,rollercoastercontests,clqbyok,1,t5_2txf7

11685059,0,t1_dgkbeyg,As long as it has a realistic layout it will be ok check some layout concepts mind you only official and realistic ingame shuttle coasters allowed. Stuff like family boomerang are allowed stuff that currently dont have a shuttle layout IRL like bobsleigh are not allowed powered launch coasters in the first game with no IRL version also arent allowed so no standup shuttle either.,rollercoastercontests,dgkiorr,1,t5_2txf7
