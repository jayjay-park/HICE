247245,0,t1_cf6903a,Well even a rough outline of the space shuttle would actually lock in a lot of design variables.  Once the general picture is there the engineers need to make things work so convergent design takes care of much of the rest.For example the shapes of the orbiters are quite similar but once youve chosen a given cargo size the aerodynamic constraints are quite strict.  The vehicle has to survive orbital reentry and must be achieve stable flight through a wide range of mach values.  This leads to the swept wings with relatively blunt surfaces.Now Im certain the spying and copying did play a role in the design but theres no need to think they had detailed plans.,spaceporn,cf6dp0h,11,t5_2s9jc

Every night we would drop fishing lines off the side of the pier on cane poles bamboo fishing pole.  no reel just line tied to the end of it and in the morning they would be gone.  Next step?  Hop on the bass boat or jet ski and find them.  You could sometimes see these poles sliding up and down the surface of the water.  Needless to say we would track them down and either pull the fish into the boat or if it was in the cove we lived in we would just dive in and grab the line to pull them back to the pier.  Still nothing scarier than pulling on the line feeling it tug back HARD and feeling the line being pulled right below you and then feeling it go slack.,spaceporn,cn3wwt7,5,t5_2s9jc

2884707,0,t3_2t6040,From NASA source gt What causes the structure in Comet Lovejoys tail? Comet C Q Lovejoy which is currently at nakedeye brightness and near its brightest has been showing an exquisitely detailed ion tail. As the name implies the ion tail is made of ionized gas  gas energized by ultraviolet light from the Sun and pushed outward by the solar wind. The solar wind is quite structured and sculpted by the Suns complex and ever changing magnetic field. The effect of the variable solar wind combined with different gas jets venting from the comets nucleus accounts for the tails complex structure. Following the wind structure in Comet Lovejoys tail can be seen to move outward from the Sun even alter its wavy appearance over time. The blue color of the ion tail is dominated by recombining carbon monoxide molecules while the green color of the coma surrounding the head of the comet is created mostly by a slight amount of recombining diatomic carbon molecules.,spaceporn,cnvzrxi,1,t5_2s9jc

If you look at the topographical images you will notice much of the detail is slightly bluish grey this is due to the filter on each of the pan cams which is set for contrast.

The large dark oval near the western limb the left edge is at a latitude of  degrees south and circuits Neptune every . hours. The bright clouds immediately to the south and east of this oval are seen to substantially change their appearances in periods as short as four hours. The second dark spot at  degrees south latitude near the terminator lower right edge circuits Neptune every . hours.

3931289,0,t1_cr494q9,OK I am not saying you are wrong but I suspect that you are ... let me explain why.Lets say that there were no stars at all and the earth spun within an enormous sphere.  Then lets paint one spot on the sphere directly above the axis of rotation and call it Polaris.  Paint another spot anywhere in the northern hemisphere and call it Vega.  In a time exposure Vega would describe a circle on the sky around Polaris.  Now wobble the earths axis of rotation so that Vega not Polaris is directly above the earths axis of rotation.  Now in a time exposure Polaris would describe a circle on the sky around Vega.Hopefully we agree so far.The point I am making is that unlike the two pictures from OP what would actually happen is that from the perspective of an observer standing in the same place and looking the same direction on earth the center of the circle would be in the same place  that is it wouldnt move relative to the building and other landmarks we can see  unless the earths axis of rotation changed relative to the surface of the earth as well which I think would require catastrophic amounts of energy.  What I am assuming is that the earths axis of rotation is essentially fixed relative to the earth and when we say the axis of rotation wobbles we are saying that the entire earth wobbles to follow it.,spaceporn,cr4ehvl,2,t5_2s9jc

Near the South Pole for example the core is permanently at about  degrees azimuth in Scotland the core barely gets above the horizon at any point during the year. At mid latitudes itll rise in the east and set in the west between Feb and Nov its not visible during the other months because it rises and sets during daylight hours while in June it will be directly overhead around midnight. As E above suggested use Stellarium and it will tell you exactly where it will be at any time in the future or even where it was in the past.,spaceporn,cri1kdf,5,t5_2s9jc
4154546,0,t1_crtow6e,The biggest problem with achieving orbit from Mars or from Earth is not the atmosphere or the altitude its the velocity.  At Mars the atmosphere is so thin that it really doesnt present much of an impediment at all.  But the escape velocity at Mars is about  kms about  mph so as ujaxxer pointed out you need a lot of fuel to accelerate your vehicle to that speed.  Robert Zubrin et al suggest using a fairly simple chemical process to convert the CO in the Martian atmosphere into methane and oxygen which would allow you to make your fuel on Mars for the return trip.  This reduces the mass needed to send to Mars in the first place by a large amount which either makes the trip feasible at all or at least greatly increases the size of the vehicle you send and the amount of samples you can bring back.,spaceporn,crttxue,3,t5_2s9jc

5271415,0,t1_cvlgv4g,As I said in the comment at the top this image is in enhanced color meaning that it includes both visible light and infrared light which appears blue in the image.Astronomical images come in all varieties of color types.  Take this pair of images for example!  On the left we have the beautiful Orion Nebula in visible light or True Color and appears as it would if you were seeing it with your own eyes once your eyes adjusted to the level of brightness you were seeing.  If you look at it through a telescope it will appear very white and diffuse since our eyes cant really distinguish color very well when the light is diffuse and far away.In the righthand panel we have whats called False Color which is an image taken entirely in infrared light rather than visible light with all the wavelengths scientific term for specific color of light observed represented as visible light colors so that we can see and distinguish them.  This is what the Orion nebula would look like if we had evolved to only see infrared light instead of visible light.  Notice how some features that you couldnt see in visible have appeared in the infrared and notice how some features have disappeared like the band of dust you see in the visible light image.  This allows us to differentiate between different types of gasses in the nebula.Sometimes images will combine visible light wavelengths and wavelengths of nonvisible like like UV gamma ray radio and infrared and these images are called Enhanced color like we see in the image of Charon in the original post which includes infrared as I mentioned before.  For comparison here is an Image of Pluto amp Charon in true color as your eyes would see it with their relative brightnesses.,spaceporn,cvlhdto,3,t5_2s9jc

So it either has no core or a core in the  Earth mass range. Somewhat related Saturn is thought to have a core around  earth masses or so.

Both humanity and other intelligent civilizations may be gone by the time their technology meets with ours but if we create advanced enough super computers drones and automated systems it may be enough to spur life again in another part of the universe. If life couldnt sustain such a long journey maybe the knowledge of how to create a lifefriendly environment could. Eventually the life that spurs from these dronecreated environments could come into contact with each other and have lifetolife interactions. At least thats one scenario I could imagine playing out.,spaceporn,d6aje9z,12,t5_2s9jc

8949119,0,t3_52v3j6,gt An allsky view of stars in our Galaxy  the Milky Way  and neighbouring galaxies based on the first year of observations from ESAs Gaia satellite from July  to September .gt This map shows the density of stars observed by Gaia in each portion of the sky. Brighter regions indicate denser concentrations of stars while darker regions correspond to patches of the sky where fewer stars are observed.gt The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy with most of its stars residing in a disc about   lightyears across and about  lightyears thick. This structure is visible in the sky as the Galactic Plane  the brightest portion of this image which runs horizontally and is especially bright at the centre.gt Darker regions across the Galactic Plane correspond to dense clouds of interstellar gas and dust that absorb starlight along the line of sight.gt Many globular and open clusters  groupings of stars held together by their mutual gravity  are also sprinkled across the image.gt Globular clusters large assemblies of hundreds of thousands to millions of old stars are mainly found in the halo of the Milky Way a roughly spherical structure with a radius of about   lightyears and so are visible across the image.gt Open clusters are smaller assemblies of hundreds to thousands of stars and are found mainly in the Galactic Plane.gt The two bright objects in the lower right of the image are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds two dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way. Other nearby galaxies are also visible most notably Andromeda also known as M the largest galactic neighbour to the Milky Way in the lower left of the image. Below Andromeda is its satellite the Triangulum galaxy M.gt A number of artefacts are also visible on the image. These curved features and darker stripes are not of astronomical origin but rather reflect Gaias scanning procedure. As this map is based on observations performed during the missions first year the survey is not yet uniform across the sky.gt These artefacts will gradually disappear as more data are gathered during the fiveyear mission.gt High resolution versions of the Gaia map including four with a transparent background are available to download from the righthand menu.gt An annotated version of this image is available here.gt Credit ESAGaiaDPACgt Acknowledgement A.

9887994,0,t3_5h0ldq,gtAlthough HerbigHaro HH objects come in a wide array of shapes the basic configuration is usually the same. Twin jets of heated gas ejected in opposite directions from a forming star stream through interstellar space. These outflows are fueled by gas falling onto the young star which is surrounded by a disc of dust and gas. If the disc is the fuel tank the star is the gravitational engine and the jets are the exhaust.gtIn Hubbles image of HH  one such turbulent streamer of gas can clearly be seen streaking across the frame.gtThe intricate structures within HH  and other HerbigHaro objects exist because the jets are not being blown through a pure vacuum. When the energetic and fastmoving HerbigHaro jets slam into colder gas they form shock fronts that look and behave much like the bow waves that form in front of a boat. These socalled bow shocks which glow thanks to very high temperatures are a distinctive feature of HerbigHaro objects.gtThe structure of HH  and other objects like it acts like a tickertape recording the activity of the star that is the origin of the jet. Erratic outbursts from the star happen at times when more matter is falling in and these are recorded as brighter knots or blobs within the HerbigHaro object which move along the jet over the years. Although the jets are very fastmoving they are also very large the streamer of gas in this image is around half a lightyear in length. This means that the motion appears quite slow from our vantage point even when measured over years see heic.gtBy measuring the current speed and positions of blobs within a HerbigHaro object astronomers can rewind time projecting the motion of the knots backwards to the moment when they were emitted. This in turn tells the scientists about the environment directly around the forming star. Source,spaceporn,dawfflh,4,t5_2s9jc
