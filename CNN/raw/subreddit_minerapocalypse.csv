587567,0,t3_20v9y7,I have been taskedgiven the honor of designing a maze combat area. This is my idea for it but I am... inept in the ways of pvp. The plan is to have a small pyramid structure in the middle maybe a beacon Idk yet. Each maze will likely be x or larger unsure yet with  mazes total.  corners where each team will start  sides where there will be a central mob spawner and a pathway into the pyramid from that room and the pyramid itself. My plan is to make the hallways  blocks wide and have each corner connected through a side maze giving people options about how they wish to access the central pyramid. I imagine the end goal of this would be some kind of complex king of the hill or something I have no idea about pvp maybe a race to the top.

804790,0,t3_23cu7r,I suggest we remove obsidian and block protection because the game is too hard for griefers. They stand no chance against these blocks which require diamonds to break. Think about it. In order to grief a town the griefer has to grind efficiency and unbreakings enchants for hours! How boring! and then all those diamonds for the pickaxes...   The issue here is that a griefer shouldnt have to spend time doing boring stuff to compete with those builders. Its just not fair.  Now the above is a poor analogy and you shouldnt take it seriously.  Your suggestion is bad for the following reasons  . Builders in iron still get fucked by pvpers in iron even more so. The current system is incredibly kind to bad pvpers. v is almost impossible to win.  . Lowers the amount of things to do in a game which already lacks end game. A new player can compete in a few hours! Yay so he can quit in a few days unless he wants to be a builder?  . Strongly Balancing pvp around builders.

898538,0,t1_ch6etoz,No no. Not that. What I mean is how the world loses its mystery as soon as you get to know the right people and know the right locations. for example coordinates make navigating FAR too easy. As I stated in the post before coordinates ruin the concept of a wilderness where almost anything can happen at any given time. Its impossible to get lost. To know where things are going down you just need to ask a friend of yours for coordinates. As soon as someone knows where something is its very easy to spread the info without even having to go to that location yourself.And how there is barely any mystery regarding people. It feels like everyone knows eachother and what sort of players we are. If someone feels like being a bad guy for once the word spreads faster than wildfire.When I first joined the server I lived in constant paranoia of someone watching me or ambushing me. I had no idea what kind of people I had befriended and sure as hell didnt know where I was going. Now all that magic is gone and I can get everything I need with a few PMs.,minerapocalypse,ch6f2y9,2,t5_2tc3u

985823,0,t3_25dtzj,TLDR I feel like there is too much democracy on the server. But I like it. I have a torn view on this opinion and I hopefully explained why in the full post.I dont know whether this opinion deserves a whole post to itself but its kinda hit upon in your post so Ill put it here. Is there too much democracy on the server? Does the community have too much say?I am unsure about my own opinion here and I feel divided posting this. The community input is great the different staff boards are great the clearer transparency were seeing from the staff is great but looking back to when this server started and looking at a lot of other community based servers the staff hashad the final say what they say is final and the community either likes it or hates it but gets on with it. And those other community based servers arent deaddying. The staff takes suggestions from the community but in the end its completely up to them what to do with those suggestions. I think the levels of democracy are great for people like me by this I mean the common player but then again the levels of democracy are kinda shit for people like me. It feels like the staff just dont want to be in a position where players will be able to point their fingers at them and say You fucked up. and I get that. At this point the staff and the players are friends and to have a friend saying you fucked up is not nice and its human nature to shy away from that position of responsibility when all you want to do is Play A Game. And I mean thats the only reason the staff became staff on the server they just wanted to play a game.To expand on how I believe the democracy is great we were able to vote upon the change made to list and the change was rolled backmodified. To expand on how I believe the democracy is shit the staff had to roll back a change which could have been a small positive change without the server having play tested it first.Now hopefully you can see where Im torn on my own opinion  I love that the community has an influence on the server but if the staff said We think we should split funds and run an additional PVE server alongside the main PVP one because the different play styles might get more people involved on the different style servers the community shouldnt be in a position to stop that. But they should because its their server. But the staff has the final say because theyre in charge of the server.I think the problem is ingrained in our communities belief like I said near the end of my last paragraph the its their server belief. But its not mine or the communities server.When a new player starts on the server they feel their suggestions wont make much difference that in the end the staff might take the suggestion on board or they might not. And they dont mind that when they start and if the staff disregards their suggestion noone really cares.But now when players become veterans they feel their opinion is a view which couldshould change the server.And then if the staff disregards the veterans view they can get called every kind of expletive they get publically degraded. That behavior shouldnt be acceptable. Its cancerous. We cant just sit here and watch the staff be degraded because then we lose respect for them when they cant defend or justify themselves to the person who is acting the bollocks.But the staff shouldnt have to defend itself and it certainly shouldnt have to justify itself the staff should run the server how they believe is best. And if the staff fucks up occasionally at least if theyre able to look back apologize and make amends then thats all the community should hope for. To conclude  I feel the server has a little bit too much democracy I think the server needs to be run autonomously the front page of the subreddit shouldnt be plastered with post regarding discussion of changes it should have notifications of changes but mostly play related posts. Look back on the top posts for the subreddit  there is suggestions and play related posts  no discussion of changes. Because the community dont really want that. They want a server thats reliable and fun reliably fun that they dont feel the need to look after or check up on when theyre gone.But I still want the community to have a say in how the server is run.And I dont know what can be done about this.,minerapocalypse,chgcgkk,10,t5_2tc3u

Custom map was the first time i really grouped up with anyone and did anything with them. I got bored and swami invited me to join him at Fjord to help out it wasnt far from my base so off i went. Helped fix that place up and then after the repeated griefing I went and dug us an underground cave that eventually become avas grove or something like that. Dug that out a decent amount and built the city up from the ground eventually a lot more people moved in and coop started expanding rapidly which somehow brought red army down on us. We defended that place but me and swami eventually paid them off. We built a x maze there took forever to dig the damn hole for it the plan was to make it have layers but as per usual someone came and wrecked the place before i had a chance to do anything.,minerapocalypse,ckgo9bf,3,t5_2tc3u

Assuming I have solid evidence in video that Oz xrays Id just be told to shut up because Im banned. What a great stable community. Oz was literally roasted because he was caught illegally cavemapping on CivCraft. What stops him from doing so in Minerap?As for the exposed blocks I can assure you that is not the works of Mojo and the rest of the builders nor the residents. Of all the time Ive gone back and forth from Polis not a single block was exposed and even entering was a bit of a hassle as it required someone to be inside and actually finding the specific block to stand on.

Ultimately I just think it wouldnt have the same thrill if griefing werent allowed.When Tijs said that griefers are cunts I think he was stating the obvious and theres not really any question about it. Im not sure how I feel about his statement that we shouldnt glorify griefing though.On the one hand it might drive away newcomers though I feel like thats a dubious statement but on the other hand its not the same cunt griefers who try to advertise their hostility in an rminerapcirclejerk sort of way probably because those cunt griefers know that theyll just get downvoted because of it.Ultimately I think what gives us meaning are the actions we choose to do ingame and we shouldnt censor or deny peoples achievements if we dont agree with them or if someone who shares their views might get an erection.,minerapocalypse,czjpe0t,4,t5_2tc3u
