5950255,0,t1_cxzkq0d,Unfortunately not  both stores said that only the police can access the tapes.  But even after I gave all the store info to the police theyve done squat  checking with both stores after  weeks the police havent been by to even review the tapes.  Tax dollars at work eh?,SFlist,cxzlx10,2,t5_2u5kv
