11095213,0,t1_depmrt5,gtThe Antlers  Epilogue Live at the Historic USO gtgtI have always had a lovehate relationship with the album Hospice ever since I first heard it in middle school. At the time I first heard Kettering my family and I were dealing with the loss of a loved one who chose to undergo hospice care. Even though the record is not literally about a cancer patient undergoing hospice the album has always been somewhat comforting and therapeutic for me. After recently returning to the album this year I discovered that Peter Silbermans lyrics regarding his abusive and toxic relationship to be incredibly relatable and now the record resonates with me more than it ever has before. That being said though this album is extremely hard to listen to often because it is so goddamn depressing. Hope you enjoy my cover!gt Sequoia Brother in Musicgt views since Mar bot inforyoutubefactsbotwikiindex,TheAntlers,depmsbw,1,t5_2skgt
