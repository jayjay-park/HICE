7611970,0,t1_d37ehg2,His arguments were uninformed considering how much these sponsorship deals affect him. Like when he is comparing wearing Reebok gear to an NFL player wearing their team gear the NFL players have an agreement to split a percentage of the money between the players and the owners compared to the UFC which just give a set amount not related to how much Reebok pay. Its clearly a lot more fair to NFL players.He also tried to justify the Reebok deal by saying the UFC hooks him up with a free Harley and that he gets any Reebok clothes he wants...which to me just seemed kind of laughable and as Schuab said he can buy any Reebok gear he wants with the old sponsorship money. We know from previous podcasts Schuab is talking about how all fighters need to get a good deal in order to grow the sport. The best athletes are never going to choose MMA over other sports if its both more dangerous and not very rewarding financially. Schuab didnt really convey his point about new fighters well so I forgive Cowboy for not really having a good response to it. Obviously though the amount that a lot of these fighters make is absolutely horrendous all factors considered. Cowboy only really made one good point in that without a fighters union he cant do much since there will always be someone willing to take the fight for whatever amount the UFC offers. ,thefighterandthekid,d37fw72,7,t5_347fo

Brendan is a simpleton with a simple understanding of the world who enjoys things being simple so he can understand them. Bryan is a people pleaser who gets attached to ideas without going deep enough into the idea to the proper perspective.Add those together and you get yourself a shitshow that is slowly running outa steam.

11159249,0,t1_dewvq79,Im in the middle of Bryan and Brendan on this one. The dude punched a girl who was aggressive with him first. There has to be like a slappunch count before youre allowed to just hit back.If a girl slaps you ok fine but if she punches you more than once and isnt stopping I think you have the right to use equal force to stop the attack.Brendans way of arguing any point including this one by just repeating no no not ok over and over doesnt work.

11559349,0,t1_dg68xqw,they stopped it because they thought it was an illegal knee then they ended the fight because of what you said  Weidman seemed too fucked up to continue fightingI agree that its kind of hard to ask someone questions mid fight super tiring after getting a knee to the head and knowing Weidman he might not have known even if he wasnt mid fight but there needs to be some concussion test so if that is what they normally do then so be it... I still think they shouldve called it a NC because it ended by a ref stepping in due to him thinking it was an illegal knee granted if The Chris had a flap of his face hanging off there it wouldve ended due to that so idk.  we dont know if Weidman wouldve continued to fight or not... the man has taken quite a beating in the past and survived but I get from the medical standpoint stopping it.  IDK its tough man Im on edge about it could be a good TKO but I think we need to see a rematch  ,thefighterandthekid,dg698tz,3,t5_347fo
