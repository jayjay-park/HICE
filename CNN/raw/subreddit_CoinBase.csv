121250,0,t1_ces865e,It depends on how secure you want to get.  For the absolute maximum security you can do the ubuntu stuff otherwise the Coinbase builtin paper wallet tool is fine for most users.  If youre storing upwards of say BTC it might be worth doing the Ubuntu thing.  Remember you can do the Ubuntu thing and print a great many paper wallets at once then only use them as you need them....Bitaddress the only difference between single wallet and paper wallet is the paper wallet has some nice graphics around it.  Their paper wallet design doesnt have a security fold a good paper wallet design IMHO should be foldable in such a way that the piece which folds against the private key has a security pattern so you cant read the QR code by shining a light through the paper.Check out the fold design on   when you fold it the private QR code folds against a randomized pattern and the text version of the key folds against itself.  That makes it extremely difficult to read with a flashlight.One bigger problem to consider with paper wallets is ink.  Inkjet ink is generally watersoluble which means your paper wallet could be destroyed if it gets wet.  For the best security paper wallets should be printed with a laser printer.,CoinBase,ces8ks0,2,t5_2woql

307037,0,t3_1xm2w2,I had one sit around for  hours from pm last night until am today.  Then it disappeared from Coinbase.I resent it and guess what?  The old one came back and theyre both stuck now.  Faaaantastic.  All that Support tells me is that its a random delay and to wait until the transaction either goes through or disappears.  This whole cold storage bit would have been useful information to have instead of its a random magical whatchamacallit.,CoinBase,cfclbqh,2,t5_2woql

502916,0,t1_cfxd4m5,The doc says  If youre unsure of the type of purchase you made you can look up the transaction on the BuySell page under the History tab. You will see either a concrete number of bitcoin meaning that is the fixed amount you will receive or the message You purchased bitcoin at the market rate meaning the amount you receive will vary based on the market rate that exists at the moment of payout.

Our system did have a bit of a hiccup today which caused a very small amount of transactions to take longer than usual to process.  Your pending transaction should process very soon an hour at most but please email us at supportcoinbase.com if it doesnt.

1507706,0,t3_2bgbyh,Ive never hand anything stolen from my Coinbase account. On the contrary Coinbase has done a LOT to help secure the accounts. They have  factor authentication they have a whole new API Authentication system for ensuring you only provide permissions to those services you want. You can limit what IP addresses are able to login. In addition you can even use your own offline wallet and secure it yourself if you dont trust Coinbase to secure it for you. Having security around your Coinbase account isnt just about the Coinbase account but about the password you use hint is it Password or is it something much more secure with  alphanumbericmixedcasespecialcharacters. Even more than that how secure is your email? Do you use the same password for your email that you use for everything else? What about your security reset instructions for your email? Someone could get into your Coinbase account by resetting your password from your email then from Coinbase. That isnt Coinbasess fault that is your own. Did you click on a link in your email that says Please verifylogin to your Coinbase account? If so you may have been a victim of phishing by willingly giving up your info to someone else. Again not Coinbases fault. What is your proof that this was Coinbases fault? I think we would all like to see that please.,CoinBase,cj59l9b,10,t5_2woql

11536620,0,t3_64ni4y,I feel your pain. My account was also closed today for what I assumed was a compliance officer having a bad day but now I realize is connected to a larger sweeping policy. I had to move over  bitcoin to another exchange which was a really nerveracking feeling as I wanted to simply leave it in my Coinbase account and speculate. Never did a single thing wrong never gambled or violated any policy just wanted to speculate mustve paid them hundreds in fees and I get treated like some run of the mill dodgy rulebreaker. Awesome stuff. I just dont get it they had upgraded my limit to K a week last week after I submitted enhanced KYC and then all of a sudden Im breaking rules? Had over K in bitcoin just literally SITTING in the account unbelievable. ,CoinBase,dg3of87,3,t5_2woql
11632951,0,t1_dgeb6u5,It would be great to know but see they dont exactly tell you. And it is impossible to reach customer support. So consider yourself lucky. One day theyll probably just close your account for no reason and then you wont be able to pull the funds out. ,CoinBase,dgelvqp,1,t5_2woql
