3670251,0,t1_cqajy1g,Hi! My main concern is that I have read on the internet that it is quite difficult to get a postdoc at a top uni. if you havent graduated from one. So in that regard I am worried that if I do accept the position at UF it might just be the first in a chain of okayish schools. And how many Nobels have actually come out of such unis?Yeah could you please do that? That would be super helpful. Also do you happen to know how easytough it is to transfer from a midranked grad. program to a top program? When is it typically done in which year of ones program and do you know of anyone who has done this?,exoplanets,cqamsjg,1,t5_2ri56
9647885,0,t3_5d3tpt,Im really tempted to donate to their Kickstarter but Ive got some reservations. Ive still never heard of a crowdfunded space mission that was successful and the only major one I can think of Mars One was an obvious scam. This one seems much more legitimate and I know through  degrees of separation some of the people involved so Im hoping it wont just fizzle out. Anyone got any thoughts?,exoplanets,da2avic,1,t5_2ri56
