Jimmy disappeared at the end of a war he fought against Nucky after all. Tommy easily could have picked up on it while he was working at the club.gtwhat alternatives did Gillian have....Homelessness or an orphange.There was a third alternative Nucky and Mabel take Gillian in and raise her as their own. Gillian would have been spared the trauma that ended up ruining her and Mabel would have had a child to love even when her pregnancies ended badly.

The booze would then be loaded onto speedboats from these ships and taken to shore.On the eve of Prohibition which went into effect on January st  Atlantic County Treasurer Nucky Thompson based on the real Enoch Johnson condemns alcohol at a Womens Temperance League meeting where he is seen by Margaret Schroeder a pregnant housewife who later comes to him for help in getting her alcoholic husband Hans a job.One of the driving forces behind Prohibition and the Volstead Act was the Temperance movement which was in turn driven by a massive rise in alcoholism among first and second generation immigrant males as they struggled to find work in the land of opportunity and instead began to turn to the bottle. Antiimmigrant sentiment was also a big factor as alcohol was a big part of the culture that many of the immigrants were bringing over e.g German Beerhalls. But Nucky is just playing the game of politics and that same night he privately shares with his ward bosses his brother Sheriff Eli Thompson and the Mayor of Atlantic City a plan to make huge profits selling bootlegged liquor.
