38209,0,t3_1uj0la,Generally when older men tell their ontgroening stories they laugh about it and once started they dont stop talking about it for hours. Sure there was some violence involved but definitely not anything close to causing permanent damage. At least not on an acceptable social scale. However ontgroening nowadays is getting scaled down a lot. There has been a lot of legal issues since the abolishment of the apartheid regime stating that its an intrusion of human rights. Op of the ama is the first person Ive encountered that didnt enjoy his ontgroening so he probably had a bad experience. But it was definitely not as bad as op makes it in his ama ,southafrica,ceis4pe,1,t5_2qney
47095,0,t1_cejne1j,Well the previous system had essentially the same requirements. You could pass with a  aggregate. Given that the new system does not use an aggregate system and on top of that most students  of the  actually passed with a Diploma or higher level which is higher than the old system in aggregate. The  pass thing is very much used confusingly. Source about requirements for pass gt Also consider that IEB also uses this system and is benchmarked together with the DBE but everyone keeps relatively quiet on that. Note further in the link that there is no talk of aggregate so no you will not pass if you got  for all your grade  subjects you would fail.,southafrica,cejsj4h,3,t5_2qney

Meh SA made some contribution around the Mediterranean that even neutral observers would be very hard pressed to view as major Ive read Colonel Hans von Lucks German panzer commander memoir in which he saw some extensive action in North Africa. In there no mention was made of any South Africans he faced. The Americans initially being inexperienced in desert warfare did suffer great casualties but it was the British having a numerical advantage and being better supplied than the Germans that turned the tide in that theatre.And Smuts contribution was more political than military  he after all was a philosopher more than a soldier. As an aside he was with Churchills when the British Prime minister first visited the beaches of Normandy after DDay  he certainly wasnt anywhere near the front lines.Youre making it sound as if the Afrikaners themselves fucked up the Germans in North Africa all on their own and good grief even led some of the military campaigns themselves.

505091,0,t3_1zvi6f,Im in awe we have the coverage to be honest. Here is the thing lets say youre someone of low importance to global events just like me. An average Joe who goes to work and does his bit. My question is how much news is really available to us? Mostly only what were told or read it is very seldom we get to see the news first hand. In the case of Ukraine were often shown snapshots or cut shots on the news. Let me be clear  Ive been alive for  years and VERY SELDOM do I see the news going into enough detail. Always leaving many questions unanswered. The news is more of a very crude awareness tool rather than an actual factual account of what happened. To be double clear Im talking about the news in any current form newspapers are no better than the screened news. Many times in screened news interviewees are cut short because there is no time. The news is rushed! Period! In this case we have a unique opportunity to get into and watch ALL the details. Including the boring bits which are actually informative. I can think of many other cases where weve only been given the highlights such as the Bill Clinton trials no media involved in that other than a few obscure voice recordings. Michael Jackson trial  how much of the FULL trial is televised?So I for one am thankful to whoever made this possible. Because to me Riva is a big deal. And I want the truth. However I am nearly sure Oscar will be acquitted based on lack of circumstantial evidence. ,southafrica,cfxok5m,1,t5_2qney

SA has a split school system some private some government.Private schools tend to either English mainly Afrikaans or foreign language e.g. German. The last tends to be full of diplomats amp is often backrolled by a foreign government.Government schools  it depends heavily on the area. So called Model C schools are a leftover from Apartheid times. Essentially the white schools. Obviously they are no longer white but they still tend to dominate. These mostly teach in English amp Afrikaans. The rest of the Government schools are mostly nonModel C rural schools...and there you get the entire range...mostly under staffed amp thus poorly performing. Obviously you get miracles too though...schools doing well despite little resources with sheer power of will. For the language on the rural front  see other comments in thread.If this is for an assignment be sure to mention that the vast majority of SA can speak English. Maybe not grade A English but entirely adequate. Youd really need to be in some rural shthole to encounter someone who does not. You might also want to mention in passing that the schools dont even write the same final exam Private schools write IEB gov schools write the gov paper foreign lang schools tend to write IEB plus whatever the country they are associated with writes,southafrica,cg0x4ss,6,t5_2qney

The instructor pays the official a bribe and this ensures the learner will pass his test  unless he does something very stupid and dangerous.It is possible to pass on skills alone but these cases speak more of the integrity of the official and the local testing station.Look a lot of the instructors are good at their job and work hard to make sure the learner can actually drive responsibly because theyre also stuck with this endemic corruption.It has also become much harder to book for a learners and drivers test because the more the bureacracy bloats the more useless it becomes.

Im English south african and like I said I have just heard extremely racist stories about orania such as English and black south Africans are not welcome and not tolerated. I applaud the citizens of orania for being so self sustained its really an achievement. I cant say I agree with the idea to be honest alienating yourself from the rest of the country is not a wise move in my opinion. I find it arrogant and frankly insulting but at the same time each to their own I suppose. I dont fully understand the attraction they say its safe that may be true but surely a life style like that would put your mind in a state of tunnel vision. Wont the children growing up in orania be completely behind in all aspects of life outside of orania? If I may be honest I really do not understand why some Afrikaans people completely pull away from anything different or not Afrikaans? I ask that question with trying not to offend its just a question I have always asked myself when in a situation of being discriminated against for being English.Thanks again for the response I did not expect it. ,southafrica,ckelbsq,2,t5_2qney

Ultimately because of the large gap between supplied power and available power wind and solar do not make financial sense for very large projects.

It is by no means limited only to himself. His entire family and inner circle benefit unjustly from each and every South Africans hard work.

She would make more money renting some of it to others to farm on and then collect the rent money every month.In this case the owner does not add any value to the production of the mielies. The farmer who works the land must pay a rent to the land owner. This is money that could otherwise be invested in a new tractor or employing an extra labourer. But instead of that the consumer must cover that rent when they purchase the mielies.Its like how the British would arrive at a river in Africa and start taxing all the trade that went up and down the river not adding any value along the way. In the end it stifles economic growth unless it is reinvested productively not in the case of the British because they would spend it on gunboats and whatnot the landowner would spend it on German motorcars and other foreign luxuries.

Also the Gautrain Bus goes to Melrose Arch from rosebank Melrose arch is one of my favorite places to chill in the region If youre going to johannesburg park station this is in Joburg CBD youll need to arrange a taxi to pick you up and take you to the markets. All in all Id budget around  euros to pay for the taxi call around there are services like SA cabs or Zebra Cabs or Rixi Taxi so you can get the best price for the region. If you are in Joburg or Sandton shoot me a PM and Ill give you the contact number of my cab guy hes really friendly and loves to give you a mini tour of the region as he drives I dont think its wise to post his info out on the internet all willy nilly In Pretoria youll either get off at CBD I dont really know much about this station or hatfield station which is right by the University of Pretoria so its a relatively safe region...but there is nothing there besides the university pay it a visit they have a cool museum and art gallery... so again youll need a cab to get around.

In my first day of school I had seen more disruption and abuse towards teachers than I would in a whole year in SA. If you were not a popular kid in school it wasnt uncommon to be physically bullied on a daily basis... You wouldnt have to be uncommon to be constantly sworn at.

This is disgusting. The sticker is probably going to cause wind resistance and reduce visibility causing increased petrol and accidents respectively. How did they even get into my house?

5120415,0,t1_cv2vub3,What doesnt surprise me is your delusional justification of something that was deliberate and planned. The  British and the Apartheid governments were committed to a systematic destruction of black culture and black intellectual power. This is fact. Any other narrative you may choose to spin is simple apologia for the crimes of apartheid and you should stop hiding behind undergraduate level Nietzschean rhetoric to justify it. As for your childish historical determinism  as displayed in this piece of illiteracy  This is simple group evolution theory. Its not pretty and its not fair but there you have it and woe to the lesser equipped peoples.Your mightiest example of western civilisation disproves it. Rome was quite happy to leave cultures and intellectual systems in place. Roman rule didnt mean you dumped Isis as your goddess and Roman legions famously had Mithras and Isis cults as part of their coterie of Gods. Persian relics and archaeology has shown that Achemenid empires were quite happy to let different elements of culture work with each other between their own peoples. So no what colonialism was very different to the empires that went before it. And let me warn you think this These are all in actual fact boons of the intellectual heritage then you a dont really understand how societies and culture work and b YOU are the reason that black students activists and antiracism campaigners still have to work hard and long to eradicate the inhuman scourge of racism and apartheid. ,southafrica,cv37anf,2,t5_2qney

The general consensus seems to be that if a being is able to visualise itself in the future and make plans in that future then it has a right to survive and live that future. In short if the future is valuable to someone or something then they have a right to it. Two more problems spring up however and those are Which beings meet this criteria? Not all humans do. Infants dont and neither do people who are severely brain damaged. Other animals might meet it but we do not know enough to determine that to any useful degree of certainty. Should those rights be denied to those who do not meet this criteria?Finally with AI theres another point of contention. Does the AI actually possess true sentience or is it just very good at acting like it does? Would it even be possible to tell? and for the extra mind screw the same could be asked of humansAnyway youre probably not going to get much useful debate over on this sub but try one of the philosophy or science subs if you get voted down here.,southafrica,cvaymla,2,t5_2qney

They are able to see each other as equals and will fight for each other based on the fact that they should be treated equally rather than on racebased divisions.So as far as respect goes I think that is a much more respectable thing to do than leaving a country because of a perception of victimization and fear. ,southafrica,cwa8qq4,0,t5_2qney

And I hope it catches on.So many people recently have been negative towards the protests and seeing it as just another excuse to riot. Ill admit that I thought that originally too. But as its devoloped its changed and for once its a chance for a really positive change in our country.One of the biggest things holding us back is education.

They are not as fast as fibre but competitive to ADSL in speed while bypassing Telkom completely. Basically it is a large Wifi tower that is connected via fibre to the ISP you receive special equipment from the ISP to connect to the Wifi signal. The equipment is somewhat expensive but if you sign a contract it will be heavily discountedfree.

Consider that just under half of Africa speaks French and not English.Majority of SU students are Afrikaans. Majority of WCape speaks Afrikaans.

6188386,0,t3_40beta,Here we go again...No the reason some white people despise blacks and most of those emigrate quite quickly if they can manage to is because of hurt done to them by black people. Every white racist I have encountered has either been the victim of crime by blacks had family members killed by blacks or has been forced out of a government job by government policies. White people who have been through this either take the enlightened and correct position that blacks are suffering from the results of history and we must work together as a society to improve this or become staunch racists believing that someones skin color somehow taints them into these acts. Generally the second group will leave the country but in some cases such as older poor white people they are forced to remain in South Africa. These racists are indeed the ones who despise blacks.Now obviously in the case of crime it is unavoidable and pitiful but in the case of BEE it was always avoidable. I bring this point up because of this piece of rubbish written by Malema. His plan to take property from whites will not somehow cause white people to feel love for blacks  it will cause intense hatred and racism. The destruction these people will cause will bring about equal hatred in some blacks who are racist for white blood.Malemas proposal here will not reduce racism. It will cause the most intense racism and backlash ever seen in South Africa. Not only that  taking property from foreign investors will cause them to pull out all support of South Africa and will push foreign governments to place sanctions on us again. Malemas proposal needs to be cast down as viciously as possible if we want to save our country  all races included.It will also destroy South Africas image as an enlightened country in the view of the world and will probably cause history to rewrite apartheid from something terrible done by whites to blacks as a small piece of a racial war between whites and blacks. Whites took black land and moved blacks around the country and treated them as nd class citizens?

The biggest one is the lack of direction closely followed by poor education and the corruption. In fact all  of those are very interdependent because you wont fix the education without making it a priority or getting rid of the corruption and you wont have effective wealth distribution without making it possible for the majority to participate in the modern knowledge based economy. Now what is a president for if not to provide direction? And how can you say that having the most corrupt man in the highest position in the country is not helping corruption? And a leader who only has a std  education is clearly not going to give education the attention it deserves. So yes he is not the problem but he is sure as hell not the solution either.

These divisions are elements of culture  thus simultaneously both natural and created. Thats the thing with humanity we build systems specifically to take us away from what would be natural. Weve practically removed ourselves from the food chain and are now attempting to leave the damn plannet. If there us anything natural in our way we can culture our way out of it.But specifically I dont think that the situation we have in South Africa is at all natural. We live in a heavily segregated society. From the Bantustans which separated people culturally which we inherit in our provinces distribution SothoTswanas in the North  Afrikaners concentrated in the Capes Xhosas in the South Zulus in the East etc and the Group Areas Act which divided us within our very towns white suburbs there IndianColoured  areas here and behind that that black townships. Even our schools where we learn social cues and develop cultural loyalty are divided racially. These divisions are largely what is responsible for our isolation and exclusionary behavior.,southafrica,cz0b5rg,4,t5_2qney

If a movement is made that successfully removes language from higher education then that movement can be used as an example to remove that language from other educational levelsinstitutions also. Its a slippery slope to the removal of a language completely. This isnt about the rugby braais vetkoek... etc. This might just be one of the most important and sensitive topics for Afrikaans speaking people a majority of which are Afrikaners. Yes YOU got your class in English and you dont care... Great. But there are many Afrikaans speaking people that want it taught in Afrikaans. There are many Zulu speaking people that want to be taught in isiZulu. And the same goes for all  official languages. This is the problem that the entire country faces. This is a problem introduced when the leaders decided that there need to be  official languages... Because we are the Rainbow Nation. If we truly wanted to fix the situation then we would need to have  official language... Preferably English. But I think we can all safely agree that that is not going to happen not any time soon at least. So my question is this Why arent more languages being represented in learning institutions? If we are going to be the Rainbow Nation then why dont we see more representation for other languages? I personally think that its because we have leadership that dont care about the diverse number of cultures in the country. Instead they have an agenda for one group at a time.

6888618,0,t1_d0x4dh1,Apparently the context. Morgan Freeman is talking about not seeing race anymore. We should see each other as equal human beings. The person I responded to mentions not talking about racism and past events such as apartheid and how not talking about with it is detrimental. So we can easily see how someone might not be considering the context of the video in question. Since not talking  about racism or apartheid is completely different in context than not being racist. I think we can safely say that we have indeed talked about apartheid and handled a lot of racism since. For instance BEE and the court cases where previous white commanders and officers were tried for their crimes and others given the opportunity to confess their crimes. Which gave families some form of closure. However today we still see that people are racist. We see that many white people still have prejudice just as much as many black people have prejudice. So to answer your question. I dont know if they missed anything but they sure as shit missed the context. Which is why I asked if he actually watched the video or just read the title. Because if they simply read the title or only sawheard stop talking about it  without realizing the context that would explain why that person missed the context. I could go on an infer that the person is being a moron or a troll if they do not realize the context of a situation  however I refrained from that. I simply asked the person while attempting to not be condescending if heshe actually watched the video to find out if they were moronic or being a troll. I can safely infer that that person is a troll since heshe did not respond.,southafrica,d0x54e2,1,t5_2qney

Another study by Richard Shambera  Tshwane University of Tehcnology found that there is a general lack of an entrepreneurial spirit amongst the South African youth particularly the black majority. This is despite the strong entrepreneurial support structures provided by the government through organisations such as the National Youth Development Agency NYDA which provides funding in conjunction with other programs to guide budding entrepreneurs.  And to point out another paragraph of IMMENSE generalization  gtRace and ethnicity are closely related to this issue of access to education because the majority of the recipients of public education which is characterized by a lack of resources and a shortage of skilled staff are mainly black and concentrated in townships and rural areas. The consequence is of this is that the minority white children in urban areas attending private schools have better chances of accessing opportunities and increasing their levels of education.

Firstly..gt Also what if the rules are made by people who dont have to win public support? Your use of a private organisation is a little convenient because youre taking it for granted that it has some bigger law that it has to fall under. Shall we use hypothetical States as the lawrule makers?gt Same story here let people petition to change the rule on headwear for reporters. If the news outlet chooses to not change the law then let people exercise their other option and not support the outlet. Once they stop making money theyll quickly change their mind about that rule.So allow for discriminationoppressioninjustice to continue while hoping the mechanisations of the system eventually corrects itself?gt Apartheid South Africa Unjust laws by the State Resistance punishable by death.

Following from what youve said what should black people do?gt If Apartheid is too close to home use an appropriate analogueAll of this is a monumental waste of your time but I do appreciate the effort you went to in typing it all out. The reason its a waste of your time is like I mentioned above Were not talking about the state. The way that the state sets laws versus the way a private entity sets laws are very different. Again if you cannot see this simple fact then were already off to a pretty bad start.Regardless of how you try argue for it the analogy breaks down due to that simple fact. But if were super determined to follow through with it then lets argue idiotic extremes for the sake of arguing.gt Apartheid South Africa Unjust laws by the State Resistance punishable by death. Black people cant petition out in public Sharpville etc NOR do they have freedom of movement most cant even afford the travel expenses. Following from what youve said what should black people do?Valid. And do you know what some black people did? They left the country whether through exile or other means and went to countries where they could petition for change. They hit the state in their pockets. Do you think the UN just got together one day and were like lets pick on South Africa today? No. their hand was forced by massive global support for the abolishment of apartheid. So much like I said  Petition the change as well as not supporting the business. If the appeal doesnt work then fine but keep not supporting the business. Private business needs support and if it doesnt have it then itll shrivel and die.  it is possible to affect change.

Ndebeli houses as a case in point. Zulu beadwork ditto. These are not traditional and the fact they are adopted as such doesnt remove the colonial taint. After doing some research since reading this it seems that Xhosa women have always worn some sort of headdress but judging by early illustrations and photos these were made from cow hide and not folded cloth I would suggest that a doek has all kinds of other overtones and negative connotations and if the Xhosa or other African women truly wish to reclaim their real heritage they should research it carefully.,southafrica,d455sb6,-1,t5_2qney

Its more complex than that.Property is an investment for most people and they are very sensitive to things that can affect the value of that investment.Your property is also supposed to give you a certain lifestyle which includes your surroundings and people expect to keep that lifestyle when they buy.  This isnt a white thing its the same as people in townships not wanting shabeens next door to them or wanting drug dealing areas cleaned up.Lastly you keep saying the land was stolen  Africa was conquered many generations ago but I agree that there was dispossession recently too.  For most of us who are paying off property the problem with that statement is that we may have bought a house or property from a black government have invested on that land with a business or a home paid taxes to the same government and simply invalidating that does us an injustice too.  ,southafrica,d4gdx3d,1,t5_2qney

With the human population constantly growing and the demand for labor decreasing how long before the overwhelming majority poor population decides that perhaps they will no longer allow the rich to simply own everything and exclude them from the economy?

In which world does that make you ready to either go study or work? Not this one. If youre not academically inclined go to a technical school we DEFINITELY need more of those.  Middle class schools are perfectly fine or at least they were when I got matric. Of course there were a few issues but not  people in a class room we had proper class rooms our teachers had degrees in their respective subjects not just a BEd.

8963828,0,t1_d7p3r0x,Thats the stance of many who feel the current system locks out black businesses  basically gov should pay more to support black businesses.  I think the BMF has that view?The concern with that is that it basically allows black business to automatically inflate prices if they want.  I dont think everyone will do that and i certainly wont paint black business as a whole with that brush.  But sadly all its takes is a few bad apples to perpetuate that myth.Also i think its insulting to say that black business people cannot be as efficient or creative as white business.  I think that other argument is that white business automatically benefits from scale. Thats true in some cases but i think thats more to do with the size of the busnisses than the colour of the business. I have a small business and have often lost to bigger business simply becaise that have scale  its notnevil in of of itself. Gov should rather just prioritise letting small business tackle.smaller jobs or let smaller businesses partner between themselves to achieve scale.,southafrica,d7pbfgq,2,t5_2qney

The institutions who have power over those people can though.gtWhen an institution aligns its goals along the lines of a movement like feminism and the feminists are angry their opinions are treated with more weight and they might silence their staff to tow the required narrative. Those institutions tend to be universities which are the last places that should be censoring opposing ideas. And the mainstream media which should be impartial.gtIt sucks if your opinions dont line up with your institutions but you have to deal with that and be silent or you move on.If by institution you mean you mean university... then no.gtNobody is out here silencing the people on rImGoingToHellForThis for being racist or having controversial opinions but if you bring that opinion to a public platform while representing your company you can bet youre going to be shut down.Businesses care about their image and how they make their stakeholders feel.

9363929,0,t1_d92wt4t,I dont think it qualifies as a straw man argument OP is trying to draw parallels to the  marches for equal education while these students are marching for afrocentric education which abolishes western knowledge and views. Now I can tell you that the majority of students will not blandly accept the dessecration of their curriculum and will start flocking to coursesinstitutions that offer them internationally viable education. What this leads to is a two tiered education system one focusing on keeping up with and innovating global knowledge the other on redefining and rediscovering existing knowledge in terms of an african perspective. When you have to relearn all you have learnt you arent able to stay ahead of the curve. This results in an inferior education model for some of the population which is centered around cultural and ethnic knowledge and applications while rejecting the western advancements in knowledge. Isnt that EXACTLY what bantu education was? I quote verwoerd what is the point of teaching the bantu child mathematics when it cannot use it in practice?. He had a seriously flawed perspective and perception of blacks  but what he propised and what the fallists are propising now arent that different at all. And as there has been only one person who has categorically defined what they mean by decolonized education science must fall girl Ill be using her definition as a metricWith all the videos proving the harassment of police and security its par for the course that people feel the protesters are entitled and the kiddie gloves should be taken off. My personal opinion is that the police have not been excessive and should keep the moral high ground but the judiciary should make the consequences of commiting criminal acts be real and painful.

So straight off the bat youll need to look at something that is reasonably low cost in terms of fees and has builtin diversification since you dont have enough to build you own diversified portfolio out of individual investments. Since youre young a near  equity portfolio is acceptable in terms of risk. Since you mention long term I assume the money will stay put for a very long time so Id suggest an ETF in a TFSA wrapper is best. Removing money from a TFSA has negative implications though so read up on it. In terms of providers the current low cost favourite seems to be Easy Equities though I believe Satrix has a competing product.If youre expecting your earning that climb up the tax tables then it might make sense to invest more into a RA in future.

Youre okay with that being said to them every time they complain of racial discrimination right?I am fine with that but I also support Europe having a white minority.

I remember before the DA we had potholes in our road for more than a year now they are addressed in a week. Our water systems are at the European standard our power crisis was handled extremely well compared to other provinces our budget and financial responsibilities are addressed transparently and corruption is less likely to go unnoticed. I am quite a mixed bag politically but I lean more liberal. The DA leadership at the national level comes across very whiny instead of blaming Zuma at every opportunity they should showcase their successes. Their shadow ministers in other provinces should put forth plans on how to improve governance if those plans are taken by the ANC that is just as well because the outcome is the same regardless of who gets credit. Their infighting over race and  petty feuding is annoying. I respect people who vote ANC because I understand that at the local level ANC leaders do their best to better their communities in spite of what the national leadership does. But that change must come and it must come soon. I want to raise my children here one day and every day the status quo does not change is a day that it becomes harder to justify raising my children here.

11686363,0,t1_dgk9zbv,gt BS in fact we have had an increase in social grant enrollmenYeah was expecting someone to challenge this amp was also expecting the challenge to be with zero support and go straight to personal attack real smooth by way. AnwayThe  is based on rough taxpayer numbers glorious government makes a point of not actually disclosing the number of people actually PAYING  as opposed to filing zero returns. Theyre not keen to make it obvious how low the actual payers is. Anyway best guess Ive seen is somewhere round the .m mark. Feel free to provide better info.Social grant recipients is round  mil. This number government goes to great lengths to publish and repeatedly emphasise. So that gives you roughly .  give or take a bit.urycology,southafrica,dgko0j7,2,t5_2qney

11704914,0,t1_dgm13h0,gtIm more disturbed that we have an SA version of Huffpost I dont think anybody asked for it. Eh do you not listen to the radio? Some big media conference  powwow in Sandton was advertised couple of months back and Arianna Huffington was a major guest.

11705439,0,t3_670w1l,Where to begin....Lets go with the one that stands out for me  calling for a coup.  Are you fucken stupid?  A coup by white people in SA?  Are you ignorant of our history? If there is anything that will unite the ANC the EFF and everyone else will be a white coup.  And if you take power there sure as shit isnt a way white people could hold it. Any change in government will need to come from black people or a combination of peoples to even be remotely considered legitimate.  Any talk of coup is an insult to anyone with a brain.As for the pastor himself? I am an atheist and dont really like him..but I dont judge people in a free society the right to worship as they want as long as they dont hurt or infringe on the rights of others. As for the R  thing. Sure I agree with you. But one of the things about a free society is also letting others spend their own money as they wish.So you can try change the way they spend their money by being convincing but telling them its a waste is not the way to do it.  These people already pay taxes which is meant to improve the lives of others.  Now yes their church can call for donations to make a difference. But these guys felt is was important to do this they feel it made a difference either as a community building thing or because they believe a cloud daddy is listening.  Why is that your problem?Rather do what atheists in other countries are doing  building their own community movements based on humanist ideals and doing these things themselves showing people they can have communities and make a difference outside of their churches and religions.,southafrica,dgmu190,7,t5_2qney
