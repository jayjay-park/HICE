11246480,0,t1_df6p6of,Just try to get like at least overall  rated on each squad then just keep opening packs. With the players you get sell them and then get coins and keep opening packs. If youre lucky youll get a good player. Also try joining a league once your franchise is  it will give you more opportunities to open league packs and what not. You also might want to grind events like road to riches or other player events like award winners or titleholders.,NBAForums,df6rsir,2,t5_3cm4m

Which flags you CAN get and what order the events are in is random. Sometimes there is not even a Germany event on Friday! Then youll have to wait another week. The German players you need for  Dirk can be bought from the auction house.I have both Big Moments Seth at SG and Int. Dirk at PF and theyre both solid players!,NBAForums,dfiino8,1,t5_3cm4m
