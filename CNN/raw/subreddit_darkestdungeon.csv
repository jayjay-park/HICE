3031155,0,t1_cobksqm,I think there may be two problems  first level  heroes really struggle with pretty much everything and second you may be spending too much on provisions.Do what some of the other players here have recommended  first use all new heroes with minimal or no provisions for quick short dungeon runs where your goal is to scavenge as much stuff from the dungeon as you can before you run out of health  forget about completing the quest.  Cycle those heroes with replacements from the coach as needed.  That will let you accumulate gold over time.Second start identifying heroes that you actually want to hang on to your keepers.  When you have a full party of them wait for an easyshort mission to become available and send them on it with full provisions eight to twelve each of food and torches maybe a few bandages.  Your goal will be to finish the dungeon so they can start accumulating experience.Third . . . back to quick dungeon runs with your throwaway heroes for cash.  Use the money to rest up and upgrade your keepers.  When your keepers are ready again look for easy quests to send them on really lowrisk stuff that will be a virtually guaranteed win.I think once you have a reliable team of level  heroes with a few upgrades you should be able to break out of the cycle.  Until then just keep focusing on cash efficiency by limiting your expenses to the bare minimum and cycling through new heroes as needed.,darkestdungeon,coc6dwi,1,t5_2znp4

They have the highest DPS in the game if they Breakthru on  enemies. Hellions have a status purge thats also a buff! They also have a aoe stun with  base stun chance as you level it up...  They should be nerfed.So with Hellion aside Grave Robber has high critical with all its skills including her aoe Flashing Daggers.

I personally really dont like but I understand that they cant let you have infinite positive quirks. Personally I think they should make it so you can select the perk that gets replaced.

3059713,0,t3_2v7g04,Well if you want THE best set of trinkets it has to be two of the martyrs amuletnot sure if that is the exact name.  Each one gives  deathblow resist and when combined with unyielding makes a character unkillable.  This is also something they need to fix if it hasnt been already.

I had meant to make a thread about this somewhere else and never got to it but I hope that they consider hiring him to do more lines with the money they are making off of early access. Dont get me wrong his lines never get old but just imagine if there were two or even three times as many for each event that happens. With the wonderfully vocabularic writing and his deep foreboding voice this game would have the best atmosphere of any game released this year no contest. Already does pretty much but in any case..

I got  positive and  negative traits on one character during  dungeonrun without the bonustraits for complete mission. Luckily a throwaway... Regarding  i disagree though. It does not seem as if any character would go into the sanatorium out of free will. It never really seems as if they know whats going on they just get locked up or injected with something without prior knowledge.But It could be possible that the stress of being locked up and treated could cause additional quirks temporary or persistent requiring additional treatment.

3132770,0,t1_comoxq5,Yeah but theres no real reason for hunger to be on an RNG its not like combat. Combat RNG is very much in the spirit of the game its a high intensity situation where things can and will go wrong. But hunger is fairly consistent people get hungry and they need to eat. It shouldnt be quasirandom when they have to do it.I dont mind having to pack a lot of food but its weird that sometimes a very amply provisioned expedition gets in trouble because the hunger prompt triggers three times within a few hallways. Hunger is a logistical problem that I should be able to plan reasonably well for and any problems that arise from it should be the result of me taking a long time to do a quest taking a bad route through the dungeon overeating at camp ETC.You could even have different events effect the meter differently like the exertion of combat rounds taking an additional penalty on your hunger that would keep the DD aspect of not quite knowing what to expect and plan for and make the system feel more fair.,darkestdungeon,compjxh,35,t5_2znp4

3190180,0,t1_cosmzqk,Plague Doctors scale really well with investment like any other class but the key with them is to take Blight  increasing trinkets. Their Blight damage per round on their grenade was increased I believe and Battlefield Medicine had a tiny heal added to it. The setup I often use for them in slot  is Noxious Blast Incision Battlefield Medicine and Blinding Gas. I use two Blight  increasing trinkets as well.Theyre very useful for leaving enemies for dead as blightbleed applies before the enemy takes their turn allowing you to preplan free healing turns without stressing your party out for stalling. Battlefield Medicine is effectively a  health heal spread out over a few turns and Incision ensures that party shuffling doesnt damage their effectiveness too much.

Given that being average is defined by relative power in comparison to other classes which out of the following classes is he better than for his given role as a frontline damage dealer?Hes certainly not better than the Hellion who does barely less damage has better targeting flexibility and can stun the front two rows. The health pool of the Crusader is comparable but the Crusader is more accurate deals with undead better has a stun the potential flexibility to heal others or stress heal and deals with being forced into the back rows better.Hes most definitely not above the MAA who was recently the best class in the game has far stronger camping abilities and better accuracy targeting actually has a tanking ability that forcibly draws aggro to him and arguably can do more damage with Riposted attacks. And theres no way hes better than the Bounty Hunter who has Mark synergy for the same damage if not higher while also having one of the best stuns.Is he serviceable? Absolutely if you force him into the right situation with the right trinkets. His camping abilities are sound for the most part for stress management he has a high health pool and when he connects he hits hard.

By her side in those final days a Crusader possessive of luminous leadership veteran vitality and an unnerving urgency in his pursuit of justice and the final destruction of these antediluvian altars of evil.

5359760,0,t3_3oeqto,heres my take on the important things to learn. DoT stacks and is the most valuable thing you can have in your party. i will almost never leave for a dungeon without at least one if not two people that can cause DoT.equipment and skills are super important!increased damage damage resist and imo what is most important getting that accuracy up. nothing fucks you over more than a whole round where everyone hits nothing but air TRINKETS! i honestly almost put this at the top. trinkets can provide insane bonuses to stats and can be reassigned at the start of every dungeon. this means you can have lvl  heroes going in and being effective fighters. for example i killed my first shambler yesterday and my party had a lvl lvl and two lvl heroes but the trinkets allowed me to destroy him.make sure you pick quests with useful items as rewards and dont fight a boss if it has a shit reward it will generate a new prize next in game week. synergy is amazing. having people that mark targets and then others that follow up on them is devastating but long and can be awkward at first but do try it out you will have a lot of fun!!edit trying to make the text appear on separate lines....,darkestdungeon,cvwrq15,5,t5_2znp4

The problem with getting the exact quirks you want is that they are random and it can take a looong time. xD,darkestdungeon,cw4g2ah,2,t5_2znp4

5476344,0,t1_cwbc0ac,Admittedly dark runs do have their issues but thats why I brought an occultist and a vestal. Theres not a whole lot that pair cant fix with the right trinkets. Speaking of trinkets I didnt give any to anyone other than my vestal. That way I could equip any trinkets I found directly onto my characters and then sell them afterwards to make even more money. As for heirlooms Id recommend saving these kinds of runs for after you dont really need heirlooms anymore. However once you dont need them these runs become immensely profitable.

5552632,0,t3_3r5gn7,The Leper is a tank and a great damage sponge. He is self sufficient can self heal and stress heal both of which give him buffs which the crusaders doesnt. In my experience he has slightly more HP and does slightly more damage than the Crusader.Early levels he is innacurate as all hell but once you level up his skills and give him some accuracy trinkets hes pretty damn good. Hes not in my A Team but he can easily fill the st or nd slot and go on missions beyond his resolve level to round out the party.He can really fit with any party but works well with ones with fewer sources of healing usually one Vestal or Occultist because the healers can focus on others while he does his tank thing up front swinging away and healing himself when appropriate,darkestdungeon,cwlcrx5,3,t5_2znp4
5558367,0,t1_cwm12d7,I dont agree. You have a team of  heroes they dont need to be selfsufficient to be good. Its totally fine when they rely on each other because a specialist hero does his or her thing better than an a class that can do everything. You wouldnt call Vestal bad she can do one thing and she does it well.  HWM is not rigid he can do lots of damage in any rank and use bleeds when necessary. He is far more versatile than Leper who is limited by the first two ranks of your team and the enemy team.  As for BH he has the best singletarget stun in the game so he has some utility. ,darkestdungeon,cwm2eg6,3,t5_2znp4

If he could be used with the holy characters with a penalty wont heal him while transformedat all or double stress from abom would feel more fun and not limit party comps.As for balance I feel Abom is on the stronger side. Rake really does too much damage for a doublehit and slam seems really niche. Also absolution just feels like it does the opposite of what his kit is meant to do heals stress when he so the stress on himself from transform is undone.

6015778,0,t1_cy7xiqe,It wouldnt really.Time is a resource that needs to be invested wisely just like everything else in this game. It takes time to get a hero to a certain level. While spending this time you also earn gold. What is suggested here is spending gold for experience.Spending gold on XP would result in a net negative for the player since they now have to spend even more time to catch up to where they were economically. They end up spending MORE time to accomplish the same things than they would if theyd just trained up a new hero and earned gold along the way.The only way this isnt true is if you make buying trained heroes so cheap that it would result in a net positive for time invested... which makes cultivating and preserving heroes trivial since it would make more sense economically to just buy a trained one instead. You might make the argument that you could somehow find a perfect balance between these two... but there are a few big problems with that. That would require a balance pass likely several actually to the games entire economic system. This would still devalue handraised heroes. Even if you found the magic sweet spot it would become an arbitrary choice by the player since it doesnt matter if they invest time in a hero or time to earn gold to buy one. Which is a big deal since this entire game is predicated on consequential decision making.Any way you cut it implementing a change like this either doesnt make any sense in terms of reducing grind since it would actually do the opposite or betray the core design philosophy of the game. Its okay to want a different experience... but what you want isnt Darkest Dungeons. ,darkestdungeon,cy871hn,2,t5_2znp4

6405595,0,t3_43d1r6,Earlygame throw heroes away as soon as they become too quirky for play. I remember how Reynauld got five negative quirks after I drove him too hard... became unreasonably difficult to run him in dungeons after that so out he goes. Upgrade your stagecoach first you never want to be out of fresh heroes. Also upgrade the guild and blacksmith when you can heroes dont actually gain any active stat increase on levelling they get  to their base resistance levels so in order to make them more powerful you have to upgrade their skills and weapons. Dont bother trying to cure or lock in quirks you can do that lategame when youre sitting upon a mountain of gold. Oh also earlygame vestals are your friend. Occultists will more or less ursurp their role lategame but for now the bleed is too risky. Try to keep  on retainer. ,darkestdungeon,czhr1pf,2,t5_2znp4

6406863,0,t1_czhk2c4,The system I imagined was something with both one way and two way relationships with a max of  per character.  However I think its best if their effects are mostly kept to the dungeon alone so you dont have to worry about characters becoming lovers and then vanishing while theyre just sitting in your roster.Some relationship ideas. Idealizes oneway if brought along with the subject they idealize they get a  stress damage buff.  They also gain the benefits of crits and kills their subject gets but suffer doubled negatives from that subject getting crit or becoming afflicted.  Often gained from seeing someone become virtuous in a successful run.. Protective oneway character will block attacks against the subject  of the time if they have more health than the subject.  Gets a negative quirk failed protector if the subject dies.  Sometimes gained by high health characters when adventuring with low health ones that hit deaths door.. Student and Mentor twoway when adventuring together the student gets bonus resolve exp at the end and the teacher gains a motivated buff which gives a small boost to several stats.  Stress gains from crits on the other are doubled.  Can only have this relationship between a higher level character and a lower level one the relationship ends if they ever have the same experience level.. Hatred oneway have a  stress damage modifier if traveling with the subject.  Does not take stress damage when subject is crit or dies.. Lovers twoway both get  stress damage modifier when adventuring together.  When camping both get  stress.  If both are sent to the same stress reducing location they reduce  stress.  If one dies or is afflicted the other is immediately stress tested.,darkestdungeon,czhw8qj,6,t5_2znp4

6598276,0,t3_461c4x,Im not insanely good at this game or anything but I have played a fair amount lately. I think you just need to find some classes you really like and check out the resists of mobs in those areas. If you look mobs in ruins and coves have high bleed resist so you dont want to bring a lot of characters that inflict bleed because they arent reaching their full potential. Blight is more effective there. The opposite is true for the other  zones. Thats not to say bringing a hellion or hound master to those bleed resistant areas is bad they just miss out on a little of their special flair. My favorite party right now is probably vestal  grave robberplague doctor  man at arms  hellion.

6603434,0,t1_d0242k1,Max level Hellion has  base damage.  The attack youre referring to is If It Bleeds which has a  DMG penalty so youre down to   base damage.  Shuffling Horror has  PROT which lowers that further to  base damage.  So its not surprising that you rarely exceeded  damage with that attack though the bleeds help that a bit.Arbalests Blind Shot has a  DMG modifier lowering her base DMG from  to  lowered further by the  PROT to .  Again not surprising that you rarely exceeded  damage with that attack.Both attacks have a measly  CRIT mod which means crits are going to be much more rare than if you used skills with better CRIT mods.Sounds to me like youre not experiencing any bugs here.  Consider taking stronger DPS on your next attempt.  I had great success with a HMVeBHHe setup.  HMs mark boosts BHs damage by  and his own by  and lowers the bosss PROT by .  So BH untrinketed had  base DMG plus  from the mark for  DMG minus only  from the bosss reduced PROT for  DMG almost twice as much as your Arbalest and Hellion combined plus far better CRIT mods.,darkestdungeon,d02clo9,3,t5_2znp4

6625805,0,t3_46fjac,For dedicated healers I prefer Occultists by a small margin.  Vestals superpower is that they can bring multiple Heroes off Deaths Door in one turn.  Thats fantastic and it makes them clearly better for some bosses ones that can deliver high damage to several folks at once.  Otherwise though I like the Occultists suite of abilities a little better.  Their Stun is less useable and their heal is infamously unreliable but they compensate with better direct damage better Crit rate a Mark higher speed a better DMG debuff better movement and a PullCorpse Clear.  Camp skills weigh in favor of the Vestal but their snobbery about Abominations is also a factor.  Edit  The OCC also benefits more from synergies with better IMO classes.  Vestals have synergies with Crusaders okayish and Lepers meh while OCCs play well with Markusing classes like the excellent Houndmaster and Bounty Hunter.  ,darkestdungeon,d04nynt,29,t5_2znp4

The numbers also dont add up properly since the starvation hit is only  of max hp so logically  negated should become a  heal but Ive definitely had it heal for way more.

6878276,0,t3_49xz66,Jester and Houndmaster do not suck!Jester is good in any comp where you want stress relief but dont want stuns or dont care about stuns because he takes the place of your th or rd tier unit.Houndmaster is great in any comp where you need a lot of damage in any particular fight because of dog treats and has one of the only two highest chance stuns in the game.Stunning IS important. Probably the biggest tactical advantage in the game. A Plague Doctor can be considered overpowered because of her ridiculously awesome stun potential.Ancestor Trinkets are eh sometimes but OMG awesome other times. Depends on the build.Running away and aborting IS an option. All it does is pile on a bit of stress and it can save you from losing important trinkets.A full upgrade blacksmith is obviously only required for champion level dungeons. The reason its good is because of the massive hit point bonuses from armor upgrades and the potential to outDPS the enemies from weapon upgrades.Bleed and Blight are fantastic for early game but suck in late game.,darkestdungeon,d0vysnv,2,t5_2znp4

DD has super high stressers so a way to control fights through stuns to enable free heals and stress heals are recommended. You also want classes that are effective from all spots for the fight.  PD and Hellion are great for stunning and for the boss fight unless Hellion gets knocked to rank.Vestal is great for sustain.  Hound Master is great for damage and stress heal and he has treats for the boss but suffers if he gets shuffled to rank. Crusader has no bad positions in the boss fight.

Also when I say corridors I mean corridors entered. The game seems to advance your hunger timer when you enter a corridor regardless of whether you actually explored it or immediately backed out.

8026426,0,t3_4p4fi3,First off the main selling point of the plague doctor is blinding gas  AoE stuns are very strong. Trading one of your actions for  of the enemies actions is huge and if you give her a blasphemous vial  stun amulet you can even do that  turns against most enemies.Beyond the AoE stun the plague doctor is still quite strong  one of the nice things about the plague doctor is that her damage output is very predictable so youll almost never do overkill damage. Her actual average damage output on a single target might not be particularly great but because you know exactly how much damage she does youll never be in those positions where you crit for  damage on a  health enemy or leave an enemy at  health etc. etc. and when you factor in the overkill damage the plague doctors damage output is pretty respectable while there are  enemies in the back row her damage output is also extremely good.And to top it off the plague doctor also gets battlefield medicine which is really good too. Some enemies do a lot of DoT damage  its terrifying getting crit by a big crab if you dont have a plague doctor  damage per turn for  turns and a heal debuff at the same time! but a plague doctor makes it completely trivial to the point that you can take an enemy like that and stall indefinitely to heal everyone and their stress.Having any heal at all also has quite a lot of utility towards the ends of fights you often have nothing useful to do with actions other than heal so even if its not a big heal it gives you a use for actions that otherwise wouldve been wasted plus it gives you another option for taking people off of deaths door.Essentially the plague doctor just has a ton of utility on top of having one of the best stun abilities in the game  even when plague doctors arent being incredible theyre not really being bad either while being insanely good the rest of the time.,darkestdungeon,d4i8un2,2,t5_2znp4

I knew from playing earlier games that retreat has its own negative consequences  you can run out of money in this game. It really is a game where all the options often suck.But my point is that bad rolls of the dice happen frequently in this game to a ridiculous degree. Heart attacks from stress is itself over the top. Its like playing a game of solitaire on the computer with a computer that always cheats.By the way I dont recall the game warning you of grinding. It does warn you of the difficulty level and the warning is correct but it is difficult to appreciate how correct until you play it.Sure some people will like it.

As long as you transform responsibly and build your party to do damage with or without his transformation hes very viable. Especially if you get him the padlock of transference. Then his stuns become near automatic and he become a great midline blighter. His best spot is in position  so plan for him to be there if possible.  The main problem I see people having with him is they build their team around his beast mode damage and dont have enough backup damage dealers.  If you build around his status altering effects I think he becomes much more effective and you still have beast mode if things get really intense.,darkestdungeon,d4zpdsu,1,t5_2znp4

9168108,0,t1_d8dtm89,Speed is important on a lot of classes but not that important on vestals. Vestals are pretty underwhelming at everything other than healing I mean yeah they can stun and do damage but theyre obviously worse at it than what other classes can do and on the first turn before the enemy acts you dont really have anything to heal most of the time.The thing thats really bad about having a midrange speed vestal is that sometimes youll move first have very little to do with your turn  you might stun but its also very likely to miss or fail in champion or the darkest dungeon and then the enemies focus fire one of your characters with maybe a few criticals.. but then on the following turn your vestal moves last which means that any surviving enemies get a nd turn of attacking before you get a chance to respond with heals. I prefer consistency  Ill take a vestal that always goes last over a vestal that sometimes goes first and sometimes goes last because that way I know for sure I can always heal inbetween the enemies turns and they wont get  back to back turns because of the speed rolls.If youre running  heal trinkets then the vestals accuracy and stun chance arent very good anyway so the stun wasnt actually that valuable to begin with  at least its rarely worth using over healing unless nothing has taken damage and since your vestal is moving last chances are if your entire party is undamaged by the end of a turn it isnt a fight worth worrying about anyway.,darkestdungeon,d8e4ilb,1,t5_2znp4

9327350,0,t1_d8y7lye,I actually use a front Antiquarian in conjunction with a Revenge Leper because why not? Her PROT buff cancels out the Revenges PROT debuff and still leaves him with a respectable  percent left. Lepers naturally tanky anyway the Antiquarian can shuffle herself backwards to move the Leper upfront if need be. This results in a slow but ridiculously hard hitting Leper who can do the damage of two frontliners. Of course additional characters offer more utility in the form of stuns torch debuffs but its fun to run.,darkestdungeon,d8yb69e,2,t5_2znp4

9355882,0,t3_58l32z,Ignoring the Darkest Dungeon bosses Id say the rank is as followsThis is assuming you have your group at the proper level with the proper weapon armor and skill levels. . Undead Crew. Necromancer. Swine King. Flesh. Siren. Prophet. Hag. Brigand PounderReally the difficulty feels less like How difficult is this boss and more How hard do I have to prepare for this bossThe Crew and Necromancer have always been pretty simple. Bring damage keep swinging. Youll win eventually. You can bring stuns or marks if you want but generally you dont have to prepare a strategy. I dont think Ive ever had either of these guys wipe me. The necromancer killed Dismas once but that was while I was still new at the game. Then you start going into Prepare territory. The Swine king teeters on the edge of needed prep. Hes a lot easier with reliable stun or some debuffing but I also havent had too much trouble when bringing a superheal vestal into this fight. There was a time that Wilbur wiped half my party after killing the big guy. I dont think Ill ever live that down. The Flesh is similar You either want a lot of AOEBleedBlight or the ability to target every zone Aim for the squishy bits!. Again though a quality healer and regular damage still gets you through this fight. Then it becomes necessary to plan. The prophet and the siren are just annoying. For the prophet you obviously want to be able to hit the th zone. Hellions grave robbers hound masters these are your best friends here. bringing just healing and damage to this fight will get you and has gotten me wiped often. The Siren on the other hand gets your party to move around alot and can turn them against one another. Avoid lepers like the plague for this fight. Highly mobile heros that work better when buffed Mark users like bounty hunters and grave robbers are great are your tickets here. Still. Sometimes she steals your power hitter and has that guy murder the hell out of you.Finally you have the Prepare or die tier. The Hag isnt as horrible for some people but she earns the  spot by having the most kills of any of these bosses for me. learning what to do against her is nightmarish. You need to be able to hit zones  and . Lepers are useless for the most part Crusaders are ineffective and youre going to be fighting with only  members most of the time. Finally The brigand pounder. Fuck this fight. Bring your most accurate grave robber and pray she never misses the matchstick. Id even recommend bringing two. Clear the bandits and hit the cannon with AoE or when its clear. This has to be a slow fight because one misstep and your entire party loses all of their HP. ,darkestdungeon,d91xbtb,1,t5_2znp4

10202712,0,t1_dbzl8ck,gambling something away isnt a problem if you give them a crappy trinket to gamble with.  Same with the bar.The REAL problem is with the negative quirks and town debuffs you can get from meditating drinking brotheling or flagellating.  Drinking gets you a dodge debuff for the entirety of that characters next quest.  Meditating can give you the calm quirk which is  damage on the first round of combat arguably the most important round of them all.  Flagellating can give you a dmg debuff for the entirety of that characters next quest and the brothel give you a  spd penalty for the entirety of the characters next quest.That being said the only two I recommend using if you can help it is the gambling hall where all you lose is money and a crap trinket...and prayer where all you can do is lose money.  The reason I recommend the gambling hall is because while you can lose trinkets in there you can WIN trinkets sometimes as well which really helps offset the cost of healing stress in the town.,darkestdungeon,dc0j90r,1,t5_2znp4

10333128,0,t1_dcewerf,Abom and manatarms are good classes but not strictly necessary. Hellion and some other classes can be good stunbots and a houndmaster can cover the Maas guard role. The only things that a Houndmaster really suffers at compared to the Maa are the Vvulf and Prophet fights where the prot from Maa is much better than the dodge from Houndmaster. Stuns are great as safety measures in general. One extra use of stuns is that you can use them to stall out fights near the end  monsters left and take the time to heal up some more. Knowing what each curio does is really useful especially with quirk curios where you have to pick the hero carefully. Might be worth going on the wiki especially since not all of them make sense from an outside perspective. E.g. why do bandages let you interact with the mummified body? It has bandages on it already and herbs and antivenom the usual antirotantipoison things dont do anything. I like to bring a healer either Vestal or Occultist on most runs but its possible to go without. Minor heals from various classes Arbalest Plague Doctor etc add up and selfhealing classes Abom Leper Houndmaster can ease the burden. You can also bring extra food to eat after battles and yeah there are some camping skills that are big heals Plague doctor has one that heals one person for half Arbalest has one that heals everyone for  plus you always get to heal from eating  food while camping. Highwayman is okay I guess? He does good damage between Duelists Advance and Pointblank Shot but that involves putting him into harms way plus Duelists Advance requires you to take damage on a squishy class. He might perform reasonably as a miniJester starting fights with PBS from position  and just attacking from position  for the rest of the fight but Finale is great for being able to hit position  and not just . His two distinguishing utility skills are Grapeshot possibly good on a team with lots of AoE but that can be difficult to put together since killing things outright is better for protecting your team and Open Vein which is potentially good on a bleed comp but unlike blight all the bleed skills already do damage to things so you dont get as much value off the bleed. I also wound up phasing Highwayman out of my comps and the only one I was still using at the end was Dismas. Ive heard that the Graverobber fills a similar role mixed meleeranged damage moves around with skills blightbleed reduction with Poison dart and Flashing Daggers but I havent used GR much so I cant say for sure. Highwayman is versatile but doesnt feel like he does any one thing extremely well. It might be worth keeping a couple around to plug gaps in team comps since he functions from any position even  to some extent. I think theres two good uses for him  Position  PBS attacker and Position  damage dealer Pistol shot has a damage penalty and Wicked SliceOpen Vein only hit positions  and  but Wicked Slice is more damage than any other character can do from position . ,darkestdungeon,dcfbfzf,1,t5_2znp4

To my knowledge this is the highest base in the game with Graverobber and Houndmaster following shortly at . High damage. Finale hits like a truck and crits like a freight train. Starting him in the first position is basically a free kill. High speed. Again unrivaled. Hes getting that Finale off first thing in the fight unless he has a fuckton of horrible quirks. And since Finale is a Self Back  you can still have  damage dealers even if the one in slot  cant do shit because hell be at slot . The most consistent stress healer.

10559549,0,t3_5r2r49,Another snail here  weeks most Champion bosses done VVulf is still running around and havent entered The Darkest Dungeon.So yeah as everybody has said party composition is key in Champion dungeons what I take into account when building a team is how is the enemy going to fuck me Up? What could go wrong?. As an example Ill write down my favourite party so you can test It and see why your teams arent working. However take into account that this team has been built around the cove and could get easily wiped out in a Champion level wealdwarrens and possibly ruins It also sucks against the cove bosses use It only on normal missions.Rank Plague doctorSkills Single target blight aoe backline blight aoe backline stun heal.Trinkets  blight then stun chance. Blasphemous vial covers both and gives some delicious accuracy. Stack as much stun chance as you can.Quircks Whatever that gives her speed is good accuracy is fine for the ocasional madman reduced stress is great.Role Destroy the backline with your blight blow them Up if they are already blighted you can stun them if you already stuned them with another character and they have the  stun resist dont worry cove enemies have super low stun resist she will easily overcome it if they are still stuned stack more blight. Afterwars look for bleeds to heal if there isnt any Plague grenade to the face of the frontliner. Always heal people out of Deaths door DONT doubt Deaths door is ALWAYS the number One priority. Heal them at the first chance always.Rank VestalSkills Heal AoE Heal Judment the hit with a self heal the stun.Trinkets Increased healing all of it. Sacred scroll reduces stun chance but is good take It if you can.Quircks Preference I love scouting chance but everything works.Role If you have a enemy with  or less stun resist on range stun It your stun has  chance with sacred scroll if you cant do this hit stress dealers with Judment if there are no stress dealers or they are about to die because of blight heal. If you cant heal hit enemies with Judment. If you wnat to use the stun to increase the Torchlight instead of hitting thats fine. Always get people out of Deaths door.Rank CrusaderSkills Smite Stun Holy lance Inspiring cry.Trinkets  stun chance trinket then Preference I like tankiness.Quircks Preference.Role Stun things If stress his high or you cant stun stress heal always prioritice the one with higher stress. If you get moved back Holy lance. Only use smite in One of the following Nothing else to do You encountered a thrall fat zombi. The thrall recibes more damage from smite because unholy ALWAYS Focus the thrall first stun him with the MaA Next character then just make sure the motherfucker is dead DONT give him half a chance to make a single move a bad speed roll can fuck you Focus him down inmediately. Get people out of Deaths door with Inspiring cry always.Rank Man at ArmsSkills Crush Rampart stun with move Bolster the speed buff the dodge buff is nice but unnecesary guard.Trinkets The  mive and stun shield is glorious then Preference i like tankiness here tooQuircks PreferenceRole Stun in this order thrall stress dealers enemy who is guarding a stress dealer piraa guarding enemy jellyfish whatever you prefer. If someone is in danger guard him if you cant stun and everyone is safe see if you can hit a stress dealer or KILL another type of enemy if none of this is available use Bolster to buff speed if it has been used at least once yoy can reuse It again or stun a enemy they have probably lost the stun resist. If everybody is safe Bolster has been used and no enemy can be stuned you can use Crush.When to camp Only camp when One of these happens Stress is above  for more than  people Hp is lower than  for  or more people you got a disease than will destroy your run you finished the Dungeon and want to camp for some free stress healing.Camping Make sure  you use One skill that prevents nightime ambushes with this team the  time points are not worth the risk because their camping is not that great as the MaAs damage buffs are almost useless. The vestal and the crusader can prevents the ambush the Plague doctor NEEDS both disease curing skills always use them if someone is sick after both are done Preference I like stress healing has much as I can then using the vestals proteccin buff.StallingThis party is great for stalling which consists on just healing your team or stuning the enemy without killing them these are some enemies you can use stalling with Uca savage Big crabs. Yes you read correctly you can stall Uca savages their damage is super low nothing the vestal cant solve in a single turn their bleed isnt dangerous at all because you have a Plague doctor the Man at arms can stun him or buff dodge and the crusader Will just heal any stress you have. When you encounter an Uca always kill the backline first then stall and fully heal even stress damage. Any combination of two of the following can be stalled Cultist brawler Guarding enemies some day Ill learn their name Jelly Snails Bandit musqueteer if you can keep him in rank . Any other enemy will deal to much damage be It heal or stress damage to reliably stall.How do I Deal with...Colector Stun him at first chance stack blight on him stun any HWM head stun MaA heads if they guard the collector let the Plague doctor just stack blight on him Vestal can hit him too if everyone is full hp.Ghoul Stun with crusader stun his backline with MaA and Vestal the MaA will usually go first and move the third enemy backwards so the vestal can stun the fourth blight them both. When he is alone stack blight on him hit him with crusader he is unholy and stun with MaA have the vestal heal everyone just in case a crit rend happens if everybody is full hp you van hit him.Shambler Dont use the goddam altar Dont do dark runs.

10696964,0,t1_ddj9xho,gt But what drew me to this game over the literally thousands of others out there was not the Cthulu theme certainly not the backstory and not even the narrator who will probably go down as the most memorable use of a narrator in any game Ive played it was the offering of a challenging and rewarding experience.And I think thats great.  If we were talking and you said to me Im thinking about trying DD but Im looking for a challenging game.  Should I try it?  I would respond with Absolutely.  If you want the most challenge play it on Stygian though Darkest will also give you a challenge.  Radiant will make the game shorter and easier in some regards but I wouldnt describe it as easy mode.gt But dont roll your eyes like it has no place in the conversation.It was the way you characterized the choice.  You were being asked to do something.  As though it was some great choice to choose the level of difficulty.  Its just a setting.  The only alternative is to have all games only have one difficulty and thus remove the choice entirely and I can say unequivocally that Im against that.gt The entire argument is about how difficulty sliders dilute the shared experienceAs I said before I dont see how this is the case.  Because the only sharing of experience in DD is when you or I tell each other of our playthrough.  And the things that Radiant affects are for the most part are things that change an entire playthrough.  And lets be honest if Im telling you about my game Im going to tell you about a memorable fight I had not the entire thing.

10869542,0,t3_5vbw6m,I beat DD first try with Vestal Jester HWM MAA. Had Jester as the one without the talisman trinket and MAA would guard him. Bright tamborine is great for stress heals. The double riposte is clutch as there are a lot of attacks that hit the front  positions and basically any time an enemy would do those they were essentially also doing  damage to themselves. Also provides more chance for crits meaning more stress healing. For Darkest Dungeon missions always make sure to buy the max amount of food bandages and torches.

10878789,0,t3_5vbw6m,If youre so scared of the DD just consult maps the layout and fight placement never change. Other than that there are  huge tips that I can give you.. Use a MAA. Obviously you need someone to guard the unprotected member and a HMs guard only lasts for one turn. Also theres be one boss fight consisting of  minibosses. With the Rampart Shield equipped a MAA can push the miniboss in position  to the back making it lose access to a very highly damaging move.. Abuse double Rapturous Cultist fights. If you leave two of them alive then you get to stall forever. Heal up to full and if you have a stress healer then you can reset everyones stress to  as well.

11286334,0,t1_dfb9wl9,Yes I know that already. What I meant is that it is of no use to run a quest that is above the level of the heroes that are running in as it wont result in more experience. Well I guess that being able to bring a hero returning from the DD if he is already too high level to run lower level quests is an exception to that. What I was expecting is that running a long champion level quest would give my heroes  xp regardless of their level but thats indeed not the case.Thanks anyway!,darkestdungeon,dfbafn3,2,t5_2znp4

11363875,0,t1_dfjvi08,Thats only mostly true  having a quirk thats  ACC to Ranged Skills doesnt matter on say a Leper because all his skills are Melee IIRC. However some negative quirks can have actual positive results  see Slow ReflexesNocturnalDiurnal on a Vestal since having a slowacting healer to mop up any damage from the round can be useful youd treat those quirks as positive. Again these are negative effects stat decreases which end up having a positive effect.,darkestdungeon,dfk2nsp,1,t5_2znp4

11740999,0,t3_67eeq0,The Pounder for sure.It has the least involved strategy. You simply kill the matchman first remaining attacks go to the other bandits. If youve killed them all your attack the Pounder which has such high prot that it takes forever. Theres no real danger as missing  attacks before the  speed Matchman is basically impossible. Its extremely tedious and RNG based. The Cannon will randomly summon  extra bandits so sometimes you are unable to attack it for several rounds as you catchup. The only tension is missing attacks which feels aweful.,darkestdungeon,dgqvemw,3,t5_2znp4
