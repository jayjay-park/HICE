2599819,0,t1_cmxw7f6,Not really a fair statement. While I do not disagree per se I do have a few use cases for Ruby on Windows.A few months ago I was tasked to build a Windows service that would monitor a folder transcode videos within the given folder and send an HTTP POST for the successfully converted videos. While I did successfully implement this in C some issues came around and the software needed to be updated since the API had changed. I was able to rewrite the entire service in Ruby compiling the script with Ocra and redistribute the service to our employees who use it. It took me a few hours to completely rewrite the service in Ruby from C. That being said and back to the point Ruby on Windows is not necessarily a bad idea given the appropriate context. In my case it was necessary and very successful. However I would agree development with Ruby on Rails in a Windows environment when the production environment is Linuxnix is a bad idea and not recommended. A development environment should always strive to match the production environment as much as possible.,rails,cmxxm54,1,t5_2qhjn

3011750,0,t1_co9rzql,Maybe you should delete those specs after you know that theyre working. Hear me out...Say that you had a model with a validation that said that the name column must not be blank. It might look something like this    validates name length  minimum  Now do you write a spec or set of specs to exercise the following inputs? nil  a aa? You can but is it worth it? Those kind of specs are generally just noise in your spec file. The reason that theyre noise is because its a very declarative piece of code that you wouldnt expect to break.  If someone is modifying that code in the model its pretty obvious whats going on.On the same note do you also write specs for relationships like a hasmany? Probably not... unless its actually getting complicated like theres conditions on the hasmany.Bringing it back to your code is authentication code already tested in its own spec? If the problem is that you want to be sure that X is authorized on action foo and Y is not authorized on action foo then perhaps you should just write a run time level check in the controller that requires that you define the access levels.Does that make sense? Basically what Im trying to say is that these pieces of declarative code dont necessarily need to be tested over and over again. You trust Post.find to work right?

With feature specs you can mostly just naively assert away like you have no idea how to program implementation is irrelevant at this point your app is a black box. Then if you need to tweak things as you implement the feature or afterwards fine. For each action a user is likely to do write up a test. For each edge case you run into while coding write up a test for it.gt Theres no content in the test database and if my feature specs are supposed to be implementationagnostic it doesnt make sense to expect seed data.You assert against your factory or fixture data or just data you manually created in the test itself best way to get started until repetition gets too much. Its pretty impossible to test a datadriven app without some form of data.,rails,cq0tnim,1,t5_2qhjn
3584920,0,t3_31eigz,One more thing to mention is that rails has two types of form helpers. There are model backed forms which is likely what you are using. The forms know what to do because they are referencing the model. If you have a model backed form and try to include a field not defined in the model it will throw an error.Models are tied to a db table and each column is an attribute of that model. Rails automatically creates getters and setters for each column its also why model backed forms can auto fill on the edit action rails is just using the getter and setter methods.You can easily test this. After adding a column or creating a model go into rails console. Exampleuser  User .newuser.usernameuser.username  Here you are calling the getter and setter methods rails created for you. Now if you try calling a method like user.email and you dont have an email column that would throw an error.The other form helper is more generic and is called with formtag since this form doesnt have a model to tell it what to do you would have to specify a url or path like a normal html form.,rails,cq0wqnz,2,t5_2qhjn

For me rather than look for an internship first then a full time position I concentrated on the course and building my own websites to learn more and jumped straight into looking for full time positions because I was confident in my skills.

5821725,0,t3_3uy8mu,in memory. gtMemory is the  reason why any Ruby application is slow. The  rule of Rails performance optimization is  of speedup comes from memory optimization remaining  from everything else. Why memory consumption is important? Because the more memory you allocate the more work Ruby GC garbage collector has to do. Rails already has a large memory footprint. Average app takes about M just after launch. If you are not careful with memory its possible that your process grows over G. With so much memory to collect its not unusual for GC to take  and more of application execution time.So basically that spreadsheet gets put into memory and then you when you execute a new task that memory is cleared and new data is stored in memorygarbage collectionhere is a good article about optimizing memory and how garbage collection worksgtRuby . and later uses a generational garbage collector. Most objects in a program are shortlived. For example you might normalize some arguments given to your function but the function is short and once it has completed then those normalized arguments are no longer needed. Generational garbage collectors take advantage of the short life of most objects by looking for garbage only among recently allocated objects. Since most object die young a generational GC maximizes the amount of memory freed for the amount of time spent collecting garbage.,rails,cxir4j1,7,t5_2qhjn

So either rails isnt pulling them into your asset path properly or theyre not set correctly. If I had to bet in a new server environment theyre not set correctly. One way to check if you got your environmental variables set correctly without running and checking your app via a browser is to go to your base directory of your app in the command line and type rails console this is a nifty way to interact with your app quickly. If you know anything about Ruby the rails console is an IRB interactive Ruby session with your rails app loaded properly. Here you have access to all of your variables you can even run instances of classes or class methods its fantastic. So to see if your environmental variables are set properly you can just type ENVIP into the command line and see if it returns the proper value.

8491386,0,t1_d62p0qw,In unix systems when you create a file and open it receive a file handle and then unlink it the file actually exists and is accessible by the handle until the handle is released even though other processes can not stat the file any longer...  This behavior his very useful and needed  and happens to also be one of the ways rootkitsmalware can try to hide its existence on a system by dropping a executable file  executing it and then unlinking it while it is running. As far as your code it looks ok  you may want to ensure the object is a file before passing to the google api or you may get random undefined meathods for path depending on the file size  in the case of a stringio the gem you are using may be able to handle that in some way or you may need to write the string to a file. The tempfile should be deleted after uploadedioparams is out of scope however you may want to have a cronjob cleaning files in the tmp path just in case any are missed. ,rails,d62yzoy,1,t5_2qhjn

I didnt need to generate a controller for EventArtist or a form for eventartist instance variable it works through the create action form for event.
