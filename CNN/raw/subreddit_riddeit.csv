315321,0,t3_1xo3ne,Im using these on my MTB    They work great for keeping me upright but Im not going very fast.x seems a bit thin. Im not very familiar with cyclocross tires but on my xs on my road bike I was having a lot of trouble on slushysemipacked roads.And assuming we get more snow its not too late. You could always save them for next winter.,riddeit,cfdgai9,3,t5_2s2gr
3067971,0,t1_cofy4ih,When I was doing a  mile commute downtown I used it as my cardio so I wanted to go fast and get sweaty. The shower was pretty important to me. I found it was very useful in the winter because I sweat a lot anyhow and the layers I wore got pretty wet after my ride. It can be done without showering but I much preferred it when i could.
