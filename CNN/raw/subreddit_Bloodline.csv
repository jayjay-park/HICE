3549468,0,t3_30vkrn,Not a psychiatrist but an MD.Danny has several diagnoses. PTSD is probably the most obvious.  He frequently flashes back to the death of his his sister and the beating.  You could argue that John also has PTSD with his flashbacks to the beating and the police interview which has caused him much distress.  Antisocial personality disorder sociopathy although this doesnt seem to fully manifest until after he hears the police interview tapes and he goes into pure evil mode.  Although still he seems to be able to turn on the charm whenever necessary even at the very beginning of the series....  Delusionshallucinationspsychosis? he talks to the grownup version of his dead sister in several scenes with his Miami girlfriend reporting that he did the same he was actually doing it and not just imagining it.  He doesnt seem to show any other signs of psychosis though.  Hallucinations can be seen as part of a psychotic disorder eg schizophrenia but can also be a severe manifestation of another disorder eg depression etc.  His delusion seems related to his major stressor and not totally randomdisordered so Id say its not psychosis. Major depression  probably although its uncertain if all criteria are met bipolar disorder I feel like hes had manic episodes where he is superproductive like opening a fleetingly successful restaurant in Miami but this is not really well supported by the narrative. poly substance abuse likely related to all of the above other diagnoses.Anything else Im not thinking of?  Hes such a rich and almosttragic character to consider.  I wonder what they will do for season  if it will be extensive flashbacks or what?  The absence of the character and the actor would leave a gaping hole IMO.,Bloodline,cpwv1zf,11,t5_2rt03

7749591,0,t3_4lbsne,I know Marcos actually on the right track but if I was Meg especially with law experience couldnt she request a different officer to interview her when he started asking all those personal questions? Im genuinely asking because I dont know. I feel like hes too close to the Rayburns to be conducting the interrogation if they dont want him to. I know it would be sketchy to ask for someone else but it would be safer.,Bloodline,d3n2knu,22,t5_2rt03

7757327,0,t1_d3n2knu,I thought they were coming into the station on good faith which means they were there to answer questions voluntarily as a normal family would when it concerns the death of their brother typically theyd want the police to find the killer if they thought the killer wasnt Lowry.Im pretty sure at any point they could have asked for lawyers or even not answered questions if they wanted to but typically thats a sign of guilt more than anything and they dont want someone digging into the case. If anything Marco interviewing them is a sign of good faith on the police departments side because hes a family friend and wouldnt you want a family friend taking it easier on you than some hot shot investigator?,Bloodline,d3ny6g4,9,t5_2rt03

7837468,0,t1_d3wv6rb,See while I love John as an actor hes fantastic this season made me really dislike his character and motivations. Mostly because the decisions have meant no going back to being a good guy so essentially all the main characters are complicit and not the type to root for at all. Honestly even though Kevin is a complete fuck up and makes REALLY rash decisions that borderline on comical hes still my favorite character overall I cant pinpoint why though. ,Bloodline,d3wzyzx,1,t5_2rt03

7856875,0,t1_d3uqstz,Hmm at first I was like aw he chose Nolan over himself  it felt unselfish which was a side I didnt think Danny had. But you do have a point. He was already counting on screwing up himself if he already didnt think he was capable of becoming someone who can provide for his own son without any more money from Robert.I think his restaurant was already in trouble at this point so Im not sure I blame him for not taking that gamble. Its complicated I guess.I wonder how much bailout money Danny got from his family over the years. And after all that he still blamed his family for his problems and thought he was entitled to more of the family wealth. Hes like a bottomless pit of need.His hateon for his family would be more legit if they didnt bail him out so much.,Bloodline,d3z6mme,1,t5_2rt03
8022602,0,t1_d3zpwgq,SAME. Hahaha. My friends and I were chilling the promo came on. I noticed Mendelsohn. My buddy was like Hey its Early Edition!.  REALLY cant go wrong stellar casting Cardellini incl  shes a rocket. ,Bloodline,d4htdec,1,t5_2rt03
8086803,0,t1_d4owsub,You never said anything about humidity at all until I did. Neither did you talk about actual temperature vs feels like temperature.Heat  the quality of being hot high temperature.By definition the Keys are not an incredibly hot place just warm with very high humidity.udepaulbluedemon gave a better response. Its extremely humid and rains frequently. Once the rain stops and the sun returns it turns into a sauna.Understand yet?,Bloodline,d4p13ox,0,t5_2rt03
8187853,0,t1_d40g7px,Thats interesting but I think the moment Meg and Kevin turn on John is to me the best part of the entire show. Its the moment you realize why Danny was such a douche to everyone in season . It is unrealistic that he would fuck over his whole family because of what happened to his sister. The dude is in his s it bothered me that he couldnt get over it. But the moment Meg and Kevin abandon their brother the person who has had their back throughout their lives thats the moment you see why Danny was such an asshole to all of them. They all fended for themselves first. I remember in season  John told Danny that he was fucked up before the accident. Finishing season  it isnt hard to see why. The only characters who actually cared were John and his father. Everyone else especially Sally were the assholes who didnt care about anyone except themselves. Its funny how the people who were presented in the initial stages of the show as bad Danny his father and John after killing Danny are the ones who end up being the most sympathetic relatively speaking.I love how the show never addresses these little things so quickly instead letting it settle and build to form complex backdrop. Really good show.Also props to the guy playing Kevin an amazing underrated performance. ,Bloodline,d5117q7,8,t5_2rt03
