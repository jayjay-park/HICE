975433,1,t3_257xz8,Theyre putting them selfs in the exact same position that resulted in their relegation again. Its their drive to be the best and the elite. Spending money they dont have on players that will get them instant results. So yes they may do well by wasting money on the likes of Miller and Boyd but it will cause yet another downfall when they crash financially again.  What they should be doing is spending some money on good youth players they can develop. Play well for a season or two and sell them on for a profit instead of hiring the has beens after big bucks. Rangers. Ive always hated you. I was raised that way. But I want you back in top tier. Big strong and stable. Play the long con and come stop the  in a row in an educated space of time.

1419452,0,t1_citg08p,We were basically pushed into administration by Craig Whyte not paying any taxes for much of his time at the club. He borrowed money from a company called Ticketus that in return for several years worth of season ticket money gave him enough to take over the club. The tax Whyte didnt pay added up to around m I think thats the correct figure. Why didnt HMRC act sooner in issuing threats of administration? Whyte was allowed to carry on not paying any tax until it got to a ridiculous amount.The EBTs had been hanging over us for a while at that point but as long as Rangers contested it it wasnt a proper debt just something that could become a massive debt in the future if our appeal was thrown out. However the phantom debt that HMRC hung over our heads for so long ended up damaging us because we couldnt attract any decent buyers and so a guy like Craig Whyte comes along and wreaks havoc.The situation now is that the people who set up the newco to take over the running of the club in place of the liquidated company essentially overspent massively and took a lot of money out of the club for themselves. Now some sections of the fans want the board out they say they want assurances that Ibrox and Murray Park wont be sold but theres a lot of different agendas although the board itself is much different to the one that took over the club in .I think thats the most basic summary I can give you but Im not entirely sure if its all accurate as it was a couple of years ago now. I dont blame you for not keeping up with everything as its exhausting even for the average Rangers fan!,ScottishFootball,ciu7g4s,3,t5_2sba4

EBTs were unwise and not confined to Rangers alone even in football terms but the end result for Rangers of taking some unwise tax avoidance decisions seems to  have outweighed the crime.More recently Rangers have made a few individuals a good living while the club itself hovers on the brink month after month.
