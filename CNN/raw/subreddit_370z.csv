1874265,0,t3_2fzrwn,Some people will say to avoid the s because it is the first model year and some had oil consumption issues. I personally fill up with  octane. It is only a couple of bucks extra per tank. ,370z,ckf1j67,1,t5_2uqfc
3053436,0,t1_coegg7y,I know  Insurance is supposed to cover the Rays wheels but they wouldnt come out and quote it and they wouldnt flat bed it so I had to go out and buy wheels and tires to drive it to their authorized repairs shop.. So eventually Ill be selling s if anyone is interested lol. Thats the only wheel and tire around here I could find immediately. ,370z,coehj1f,1,t5_2uqfc

4081152,0,t1_crlgofh,The car comes with the equipment to take them off.Perhaps it might make more sense to learn about the car before you start modifying it.,370z,crlh6l4,-3,t5_2uqfc

4527824,0,t3_3d2q1w,Im not sure but in the pic the car seems to have the Sport trim wheels and brakes.  Just be aware if they pull a bait and switch on you.,370z,ct1dazy,1,t5_2uqfc
4703559,0,t3_3fap67,I love all the new changes that they have made to the newer Nismos like the black headlights darker metal accents on the interior but why just why cant they change the door handle color to either paint match the new dark metal or like mine magnetic blackgloss black. The old aluminum color just does not look good and never has imo,370z,ctnf5wt,1,t5_2uqfc

5918850,0,t1_cxhwrz6,gt I was curious if I could take the Zspeed CSC to them and have them install itI just took my car to the dealership for the nd time and asked them this the Rep told me that as long as i bought the part and paid for labor they could install it for me there ,370z,cxvhqz6,1,t5_2uqfc

7514835,0,t1_d2w96m8, agree with your comments.  One thing is that my  had quite heavy steering and I could feel the car on the road very well. Although the  Nismo stays excellently composed on the corners and over rolls bumps etc. it feels overall a little bit less connected to the road. ,370z,d2wedvo,1,t5_2uqfc
7686016,0,t1_d3fsgjn,Yeah... a Hyundia is a Hyundia hence it depreciating over  in value in  years lol.,370z,d3fuoxs,1,t5_2uqfc

7964260,0,t3_4o8pwo,I have a Stillen CBE. Growls during warmup and then is quiet at idle. Sounds great taking off. Throaty. FI is probably louder but would be too much  for someone who cruises a lot,370z,d4b9bsy,1,t5_2uqfc
8414050,0,t3_4upu40,Forums seem to be dying off as a whole. It kind of sucks because I like forums and that you can find threads that may have a wealth of information on a single specific topic. Things moving to social media sucks because there is no easy way to search it.,370z,d5tat1e,3,t5_2uqfc
9075336,0,t3_53hioj,Update This link provides everything needed to switch your  and up z bumper with a newer Nismo bumper. Ill provide beforeafter pics in a new thread. Stay tuned!Thanks to CrayZZ for the link to the relevant thread on the Z forums. ,370z,d82pi7n,1,t5_2uqfc

9514256,0,t1_d9lnkrt,You should look at an aftermarket diffuser they generally give better airflow and an easier access port to the oil filter drain plug for easier oil changes no more  bolt nonsense,370z,d9lu2cu,1,t5_2uqfc

10409458,0,t1_dcndg4e,I guess they have been around for about  years now so if you factor in inflation the price increase has actually been a lot less. Also youre getting a bettermore powerful car now so its actually reasonably priced still ,370z,dcnza77,1,t5_2uqfc
