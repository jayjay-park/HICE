5218353,0,t3_3lgcx1,Personally it is horrible and kind of scary someone would ever want to take their lives instead of living! Unfortunately it makes sense when on is in so much pain. I believe that it is their life choice and if they in that much pain that they can no longer live on this planet they shouldnt have too! What interests me is that the doctors performing these operations can keep a straight head. Helping someone take their life is not easy to deal with. Is it the question of should assisted suicide be allowed or how does the procedure affect doctors helping these patients take their lives?,SisypheanHigh,cvf05b5,1,t5_39son
5903288,0,t3_3w0o43,The concept of word aversion is relevant to this discussion. It is the idea that we will have strong reactions to words which are triggered by the image or sound that they create. Some people even compare word aversion to phobias! One argument for the source of these reactions is the media its always the medias fault because these gross words are used for comedy and associations are made. The people on TV cringe at the word moist so we do too. Another thing to consider is that when we cringe at words we are not thinking about their denotation. Moist means slightly wet or damp. So why dont we hate the word damp? The image we create is completely different despite the fact that they are synonyms. Personally gross words do not get to me however I cannot stand words that are overused. Literally and unique are two of the worst. They are used so much that they have lost all meaning.  ,SisypheanHigh,cxtgdxt,3,t5_39son

5942700,0,t1_cxyaprm,I have been so much more aware of how many times I say like when I speak too!  I know that some people use placeholders more than others but everyone does it whether they use like or um or just pause.  In Arabic do you notice that placeholders are used less or more than people who speak english?  Or is there no difference at all? ,SisypheanHigh,cxym94r,1,t5_39son
5961869,0,t3_3wefyf,I dont think people should cheat on the SATs I think its fine if they hack them but hiring someone else to take the test isnt right. Not only is it cheating but it takes more trouble to pay someone to take your test than to just take it yourself. It also doesnt show your real score and there is a possibility of flunking out of a college if it is too advanced for you. Hacking the SATs seems perfectly acceptable since you are answering the questions by yourself without actually cheating. Id say exploiting the test shows intelligence if nothing else.,SisypheanHigh,cy14r19,1,t5_39son

6117155,0,t1_cykr51n,This is exactly how I do it Eliana! Finally someone put it into words. I agree  that I dont have the need to do it until it is actually due under pressure dun dun dun dun dunnn. Its just how my brain works and Im glad that Im not the only one who does it. While it isnt necessarily the best thing to do it really is the only way I can finish my work effectively. And thanks for the advice I will have to try that more often! This was perfectly stated!,SisypheanHigh,cykygqq,1,t5_39son
6145514,0,t1_cymq6bg,It surprises me that so many of you guys are saying you are procrastinators. I really wish too that we can determine why and how many people procrastinate but you never know. There are people who only really procrastinate on some things not all. Working best under pressure is the only way I can get my work done too. Thanks for the input Carey! ,SisypheanHigh,cyo6i1e,1,t5_39son
6257552,0,t3_41af0f,I was talking to Mr. Eure about this yesterday with Nikki because we both use tumblr often and we both kind of looked at each other wth wide eyes and said NO. Maybe in theory if people used it like they used this subreddit only staying on the page for our class and such it could work. But that being said it is so easy to get to the bad side of tumblr even easier than it is on Reddit in my opinion. Also there isnt that nsfw warning on the post before you click on it like on Reddit which is a bit of a problem in a school setting. You can blacklist things on tumblr if you wanted to but the OP has to use a tag for you to be able to blacklist their content If someone doesnt use the tag nsfw on their post youll still see it even if youve blacklisted nsfw content. Its a slippery slope but I feel like people were probably in the same position as me and making the same arguments that I am about Reddit a few years ago so who knows. Id love it to work and Id be the first person to follow whatever blog we create but the cons might outweigh the pros for this one at least when were using it for school. If you have any questions about how tumblr works let me know! That goes for anyone!,SisypheanHigh,cz0wyaw,1,t5_39son
