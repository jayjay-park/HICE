11456794,0,t3_63jf97,Hey OP. I looked through your comment history saw that you were a lot more active before something about two months ago. I hope and pray that its just one of the natural fluctuations in life and not anything bad going on but if so I would be more than willing to help you through whatever is going on. Youre a supportive passionate person who may not always put yourself out there but when you do you arent afraid to go through with what you start. Thats shown in this very post and sub. The series you follow are actually the same as lots of my friends irl and I think that were we to meet I would like to be your friend.,kindnesschain,dfumb8o,5,t5_3jvlp
