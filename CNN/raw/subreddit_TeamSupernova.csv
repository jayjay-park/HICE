9330468,0,t1_d8xotpi,I went cold turkey but it was carefully planned. I first examined what foods would have to go get taken out of my home tomato sauce cereal minicandy bars vanilla yogurt etc. I then researched what foods I would be able to eat and what my grocery list would look like. Spoiler alert its a lot of fresh food and virtually no foods that are boxed or prepackaged. Even salty chips and pistachios had sugar in them! I went to the grocery store with a list of the names of sugar so I knew what to avoid. I also avoided all artificial sweetners since the whole point is to avoid supersweet stuff. I ate a lot of fruits proteins complex carbs. The first four days were the hardest. After that it really got easier. I realized that once I started to adjust I didnt crave sweets the way I used to. Even now that Ive reintroduced sweets I still dont crave them like I used to. I also now really love things like plain greek yogurt and I dont crave sugar in everything anymore. After the challenge I just kept with the way I was eating and just reintroduced eating sugars outside the home.  would recommend but it wasnt easy. ,TeamSupernova,d8ypdyg,3,t5_3gvdm

9496192,0,t1_d9j9ajn,Oh I love that! I guess in some ways Im pretty lucky in that I have food intolerances that really prevent me from being tempted to eat a lot of things that I would loooove to eat. The pain the next day just isnt worth it!,TeamSupernova,d9jlwbu,1,t5_3gvdm

9998431,0,t3_5ioxok,I am the same weight i was yesterday but the holiday season finally got me in its clutches. Staff christmas party yesterday. Didnt eat all that much but i was drinking for like  hours and now I feel like crap. I have barely had alcohol since I started losing and this has reminded me of why I am so much better off without it.,TeamSupernova,dbatoc9,2,t5_3gvdm
