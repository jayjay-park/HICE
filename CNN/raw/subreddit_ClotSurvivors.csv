501946,0,t3_1zun0p,I was going to also suggest compression socks but after reading the comments I suppose thats not helpful.  As Everhood suggested you may want to bring up post thrombotic syndrome with your doctor but I have a home remedy that you can ask your doctor about too. I have Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome PtOTS where long story short I have trouble with blood flow throughout and my body and I pass out when I stand up for too long. What Ive found that really helps me and was suggested my doctors is LOADS of water I mean seriously I chug a oz glass as soon as I wake up in the morning and lots of salt. It helps my body retain fluid and help blood flow. Maybe try that? The other thing that has been suggested by my doctors for both the POTS and the blood clots is a lot of leg exercises. With POTS cardio workouts arent really good for me but I absolutely love yoga. I also do a lot of leg lifts and various stretches and it has helped tremendously with my soreness in my legs. Perhaps try this? I hope you find the answers youre looking for. ,ClotSurvivors,cfxbpar,2,t5_2zgpn

3775119,0,t3_33n1b4,When I had my PEs x same time it definitely didnt feel good to take a full breath. It hurt when I breathed in deep. Did they take your heart rate? I felt pretty normal but my resting heart rate was over  BPM. I never had any signs of DVT so I cant weigh in on that..,ClotSurvivors,cqmlaqy,3,t5_2zgpn

6193560,0,t1_cytmtaw,Unfortunately I dont know anything about stool softeners but I would imagine that general healthy lifestyle stuff would help. Make sure youre drinking plenty of water eating well. etc. Hopefully someone with more experience in this area can chime in.,ClotSurvivors,cytn4v2,3,t5_2zgpn
6609489,0,t1_czxf98o,Youre doing all the right things!  The best you can do is to educate yourself and be an advocate for your health.  If you have a doc that youre butting heads with change docs.  You dont have to completely agree with himher but you should be working as a team on a game plan.  I have Protein C and Factor V Leiden genetic issues but my first DVT was triggered by taking birth control pills.  By the time it was diagnosed I had bilateral PE.  Did a course of Coumadin for a year and was good for  years.  Recently took a fall and ended up with a suspected DVT but caught it waaay early since I knew what to watch for.  I do not want to take anticoagulants from now until forever so I plan on resolving what risk factors I can. My argument with my doc will be that both times we can pinpoint causes of the DVT.  Best of luck to you!  The road can be scary but it is doable!!,ClotSurvivors,d02z6pt,1,t5_2zgpn

8404427,0,t3_4uh48z,Definitely go back to your Dr. And talk about being on a blood thinner. Especially after  events. I still get pain in my sides from time to time. The best thing I have found is to try not to psych yourself out. Deep breaths. Take a seat. I have had  PE. October  November . Both times deep breaths or laughing coughing caused unbearable pain. Not just oh that is uncomfortable. But  OH SHIT get this knife out of me! ,ClotSurvivors,d5s3kre,1,t5_2zgpn
10393983,0,t3_5nvff1,I took Xarelto for about  years.  Then I ended up with a major GI bleed a few days after a colonoscopy with a polyp removal.  I held the meds  days per my gasto and primarys instructions.  They couldnt do anything for the bleeding as Id only taken the dose  hours prior so I had to lay there in observation for a full  hours while my hemoglobin went from  down to .  They had to give me blood then keep me for another  or  days to make sure everything was ok.I got a nd opinion about everything from a new hematologist and he said that Xarelto hasnt been tested for prevention of clots when it comes to genetic disorders.  Ive been on coumadin for nearly  weeks.  The regular testing kind of sucks but I do feel better knowing theres an antidote and that this medicine has been around for a long time.  Im still struggling with trying to find good information on foods that may thin the blood but not related to vitamin K.  I used to eat a lot of stuff with vinegar horseradish garlic cumin and so on and some people say thats ok but others say those can thin the blood too much so I dont have any clear information on that stuff yet which is pretty frustrating.If youre seeing a hematologist Id ask him what he wants to put you on and why he wants to put you on it.  ,ClotSurvivors,dcm838l,2,t5_2zgpn
10446216,0,t1_dcq4fa9,I had half of my visual field impaired by the stroke where half of the vision of each eye was affected for me it was the entire left half of my visual field was missing. I understand that only up to  of those with this problem get most of it back or only a partial return and that visual rehabilitation is not guaranteed.    I was so tired of running into things on my left side and getting stuck behind doorways.   What a relief to be able to see  again.  ,ClotSurvivors,dcs5yek,1,t5_2zgpn

10965793,0,t1_deagpnp,I failed to mention that not all oils are actually essential oils which are normally a natural oil typically obtained by distillation and having the characteristic fragrance of the plant or other source from which it is extracted.   Some oils sold are just mimics made from chemicals  which is where the safety is an issue.  ,ClotSurvivors,deb1lqx,1,t5_2zgpn
