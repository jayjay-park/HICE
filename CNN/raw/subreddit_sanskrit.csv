569523,0,t3_20mz0j,I had to flip the photo horizontally to read it. So this ring was most probably used as a seal too.First alphabet is pronounced as cu in cut.Its also first alphabet in Devnagri script.nd one could be l with ee sound if it wasnt for that eritcal bar. BUt it looks like tri or rti .rd again is k.If its a name it could be KARTIIK albeit misspelt should be KARTIK.Or Karshik .The middle alphabet is too bad to say it with any certainty.The two curves on top and bottom could be sounds vowels  but dont look like it..,sanskrit,cg50d76,1,t5_2rhjr
596402,0,t3_20yo5k,Sorry for your loss. Its a Hindu prayer and not a Buddhist one. Written in the Devanagari script it reads srirama jaya rama jaya jaya rama loosely translated as Rama achieve victory!. jaya means Achieve victory and is often said as a blessingexhortation. When addressed to God Rama being an incarnation it assumes the form of a prayer. The multiple repetitions of jaya and rama are idiomatic in Sanskrit.Hope this helps.,sanskrit,cg82cce,5,t5_2rhjr

3551139,0,t3_30ydnu,I figured it out.The ring is in Ranjana script and says Om Mani Padme Hum which is a Buddhist mantra.,sanskrit,cpx1x1f,3,t5_2rhjr
3671022,0,t3_32ensf,Cool. SOAS is a cool place from what I know. I came to Sanskrit from a similar background in terms of Greek and Latin Classics Oxford and I can say two things  Wow someone learned Greek from Grotons shite book? Wow.  Egenes is WAY too simple. If you have even a half decent grasp of Latin and Greek it will be childishly slow.Actually if you have even the slightest grasp of philology which having a Classics degree I assume to be the case it will be torturous. Something like Coulson or Deshpande or Golding would e better. ,sanskrit,cqapy5j,2,t5_2rhjr

6106857,0,t1_cyjhmve,My Sanskrit is passable at best...I took it for a few years and we read mostly stuff from the Mahabharata plus a decent amount of linguistic stuff like the Mahabhasya and a lot of Buddhist material like the Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit that some early works use. But Im really interested in Sanskrit and read Upanishads and Gita and sutras whenever I get a chance. So you study Sanskrit as well?,sanskrit,cyjscne,2,t5_2rhjr
7566279,0,t1_d31ta8i,Thank you. I do indeed not have a lot of knowledge of Devanagari script. Sanskrit is something I want to learn some day but I have my hands full with school and learning Arabic at the moment. Im not getting the tattoo anytime soon just working on preliminary design ideas for later in the year. I want to get it because it is my mantra that I use to remind myself to center and I want to have a symbol with me at all times to look down on and remind me to say my mantra and center. I came here because I figured people like you would know far better than me about the accuracy of things and I want it accurate obviously before I get it. Ill came back again with a second draft when I have time. Thank you.,sanskrit,d328zl6,1,t5_2rhjr
