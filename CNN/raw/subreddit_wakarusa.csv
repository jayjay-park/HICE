91658,0,t1_ceoupp0,Phil and friends is a good guess it would make a lot of sense. The reason i am so confident in PL is that a certain musician who plays in both lettuce and the PL live band dropped a reaaaaly big hint to me that PL will be the last Headliner. Perhaps i misunderstood or he was just fucking with me but we shall see. The last announcement is this week yes?,wakarusa,ceov4oa,1,t5_2qtbv
106189,0,t3_1va0y6,For anyone interested this is why he left the band.I worked with the guy he was a douche Im glad he left.For the lazyA lot of speculation going on online and that is to be expected... Let me give it to you straight... When the band begun they had a message and clear intentions for what they were doing beyond all the Mayan stuff. They wanted their music to be a healing vibration for a community of like minded spiritually aware music lovers to dance to and celebrate life through. This intention carried them from playing tiny clubs to small clubs to midsize clubs to large clubs to theaters. Their progress was gradual and their fan base grew organically through amazing live performances and high quality albums both live and studio. Through this progression Murph became the voice of the band onstage and was the human element of the band that fans who did not know the band as people could relate to. The southern hospitality in his voice that vocalized the connection between the band and fans was resonant in a very similar way to how Brownstein connects the crowd at a Biscuits show albeit with an east coast slang. Murph more so than any member of the band developed a taste for drugs beyond just smoking weed and with that came an inflated ego and sense of celebrity in the scene. This was a stark incongruence to the bands original intention and vibe but with continued success it was tolerated and the band learned to evolve in the context of this paradigm. That being said the fact that Murph is the least skilled musician in the band and also the one who developed the strongest taste for partying and all that comes with it their evolution began to stunt. Their musical ceiling was lowered and their new sound had to fit under that roof and thusly decreased its ability to be transcendent and limitless. A clear rift was beginning to form and in  when it was announced that the band would have to cancel winter tour due to Murph developing cancer in his septum it was obvious that his partying and lifestyle was far more disparate then anyone even thought. This selfinduced health issue should have been the turning point for both the band and Murph as an individual but that did not turn out to be the case. Instead the band grew further apart and with Murph being married and living in CO and the rest of the band some married w kids living in CA the separation was not only just personal but geographical as well. They continued to push on but there was a growing feeling that the inevitability of his departure was a real fact that they would eventually have to face. In the two weeks from NYE show to the announcement of the split there was intense conversation between band members as to where the band was heading. After  years together that saw them go from small draw shows in GA all the way to Red Rocks they were in need of reentering themselves into a collective agreement as to what they wanted to become. The spirit that birthed this band was barely recognizable by the band members anymore in the context of having Murph play the assumed leader role in the live setting while simultaneously holding the band back both from a musical and interpersonal standpoint. Murphs ego drove him to force the bands hand in making this decision by taking the stance that there could be no STS without him. The direction he wanted to take the music was a shadow of what the band felt they were capable of and the distance between their visions for their music and their life were too far apart for them to continue on. The rift was so deep that they could not even finish out their scheduled upcoming tour dates leaving fans upset and disillusioned with a band that they connected with on so many levels. Murph will go on to find success whether that is playing with Cherub on a fulltime basis or not. More importantly STS will undoubtedly continue on with a renewed sense of intention towards creating healing based music that evolves in a positive direction. No decision yet on what they will be doing to fill the hole on the low end but early talk has hinted that they already have someone in mind for bass as this decision was a possibility that they had foreseen happening for quite some time.,wakarusa,ceqirkn,5,t5_2qtbv

937989,0,t1_chaq1i5,gt Didnt see too much police activity in Arkansas.You must not have passed through Elkins.  Every year they set up shop and bust a lot of people there....I was stopped once by police while wandering back roads near the festival.  This was a clean minivan with no stickers  I am a long haired dude though fwiw.  They were very polite but thorough  checking my license insurance tags and taking a big sniff inside the car.  Fortunately everything was in order and I had nothing to worry about inside the vehicle so I was sent on my way.Be careful out there.  Make sure your vehicle is legit.  Travel straight and sober so you can get extra freaky at the fest!,wakarusa,chawkvf,2,t5_2qtbv

1142153,0,t1_chy3g3u, Having only camped in Main Venue I know for a fact that there are showers there however I am not sure about them being in West Woods.  Showers are  each or  for a weekend wristband.  Highly recommended. The gates open at  am Wednesdaygoing into Thursday.  Yes there will be a line not a horrendous one but expect to wait.  You have upper and lower west woods.  There are a lot of trees in west woods but if you get them is dependent on where you are in line to park.,wakarusa,chy3qdm,1,t5_2qtbv

Im personally a fan of how Waka does Interstellar Meltdown so as long as the lineup for that is strong I know Ill be satisfied but thats just my personal preference.

2817911,0,t3_2sbwip,I think there is a good chance that The Dead could be the top spot. They are doing a run for their th anniversary. Waka is announcing hints on Twitter and the last one included something old this could hint to them. Just a thought. Ive heard the dead is for playing jazz fest and lockn.

I love the music and its the reason I go but it seemed no one I was around felt the same way. I have been telling myself this would be my last year and I would just stick to phases of the moon instead since the wakarusa crowd had clearly changed. Youve made me reconsider at least  Im going to keep an open mind for next year ill continue looking for the positive people,wakarusa,cs5q26s,1,t5_2qtbv
