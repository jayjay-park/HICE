1908319,0,t3_2gfhlt,Hello there Sybella! Im Ulrich and I NPCd the lord of House Swann Lord Byron Swann during the Lions Ascent. Lord Byron Swann was Lord of Stonehelm although he was beheaded at the end of the war for picking the Baratheons side. He could be your father figure here. I only dealt with the Swanns during the war and thus uAkrilon Lord Paramount Orys Connington is your expert postwar. All I can say is that Byron is your father and that you would have grown up being a wardhostage at Storms End with Lord Orys. Lord Orys personally executed your father so you may not like him too much. ,GoTRPcommunity,ckj523u,1,t5_31ijt

2682154,0,t3_2qqzyq,Looking back on gotrp oocI loved all the uncertainty and surprise at the start of the sub. I still remember waking up and being like oh Im King now. No one talked to me at all about that in advance. Loren just said to go take the capital for Aerion...  I remember wondering if I would check my phone and find out I was dead. Its not very sustainable for a good story but it sure was fun. All the reaction gifs such as ed reacting to jojens wedding. and ed and jojen reacting to predaeronblocked passion Also all Jojens popcorning All the OOC comments at the start of the sub. Dont get me wrong Im glad we dont do it anymore but man it was fun. The Grand Maester even dropped by on my first weddings smut thread. Tack on teleporting to here.  All the voting threads. Im glad we have an archive of that.  rAislynisdead and everything on it the IRC antics and when the IRC used to be IC me Loren and Thad going on there and fighting with Jojen and Edmure the constant shipping echoing and varyo links all the ragequits how many creepy details I know about all you people IRL from your incessant chatter and how weirdly attached I am to this group of crazy internet strangers,GoTRPcommunity,cn8oeyp,1,t5_31ijt

3044679,0,t1_codk3bp,The reason we ask is that if Aeron is going to be RPing with James you can just NPC him through your James account. It might be best if you wait to ask for the character after you reach the point where the two are actually separating and RPing completely apart.You may also want to consider changing the name to something Essosi. ,GoTRPcommunity,codkwbj,1,t5_31ijt

However perhaps instead she was to be married to one of the former Magister nobles? The Magistracy fell about  years ago now.

7863429,0,t3_4ikf5l,Hi my character is from a house known a House Fenn and there is very little information on this from my research. As all houses have some form of domain whether it be a city or a small town. May I ask that House Fenn has a small village that is located on the right fork in the river between The Twins and Greytower Watch. This village would be located in the area known as The Neck. Is this ok and if so may I call it Mudguard as it protects House Reed or at least hinders them from invasion from the south?,GoTRPcommunity,d3zx638,1,t5_31ijt
7999346,0,t3_4ikf5l,Hi I was just wanting to ask for clarification about something. In the Neck there are creatures called LizardLions and I was just wondering could their hide be tough enough so that it could be fashioned into a lightweight armour? Or even if its a combination with leather armour and the hide from LizardLions to fashion this armour? That would be great to find out. Thanks for reading this and I hope we can talk soon.,GoTRPcommunity,d4f7b6f,1,t5_31ijt
