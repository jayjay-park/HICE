Ah yes. I was looking at my notes when I typed that up. After I posted it I realize that I was mistaken and was misreading my class notes. It is indeed absorbed in the small intestine and enters parietal cells through the blood.

For every  people who will tell you that they love their job youll find one who goes on a fucking tirade every time it comes up. Yes youll start out at the bottom in any job you get lab assistant or grad student or post doc or fresh professor but thats just the way that jobs work. Job prospects are pretty good for Biochem holders right now I guarantee someone will reply to this comment to give their anecdotal story about how the job market suck at least according to the data.On another note there are plenty of fields that Biochemists go into. Natural resourcesMedical schoolVirologyCell BiologyChemistryBusinessLawThese are just a few of the fields that I know people who have gone into them from a BS in Biochem. Its a very good degree and very rigorous. No matter what you end up wanting to do chances are that youll be decently prepared to go into it.Grad programs dont necessarily want a specific degree they want to see that youve done well in the program that you were in and that you meet the basic class requirements for admission to that program. Many times you wont have taken some of those classes but theyll admit you contingent on passing those courses once youre in the program.The one exception is engineering. For the most part you need a BE to get higher degrees in engineering. Good luck!,Biochemistry,chcdggg,5,t5_2qwl1

1270669,0,t3_28nb2r,Hi! If youre worried about the maths used in professional biochemistry.... dont. Unless you go into the subfields of comp biobioinformatics or biophysics strong algebraarithmetic is all you will really need. In terms of theory you might learn in classes well all the important equations I can think of in biochemistry are simple algebraic solve for X types. That being said for your physical chemistry classes you will probably need calculus. I dont think learning calculus is actually essential to understanding the physical chemistry that is relevant to most biochemists but you will still probably need it to get good grades which is really what youre talking about Im just trying to assure you not to sweat it in the long run. Two sources I can recommend The MIT opencourseware class . single variable calculus and any of the khanacademy maths playlists. Use khanacademy if you feel you are weak on the basics of algebra and then build up from there. Chances are if you struggle with maths that is really where your weaknesses lie. Most people who have a hard time with calculus just dont have their algebra fully internalised and either dont realise it or are too afraid of admitting their own failings to really go back to the basics. I basically taught myself maths and I started from basic basic algebra and got through single variable calculus in a summer. You can do it ,Biochemistry,cickfgo,5,t5_2qwl1
1273916,0,t3_28nb2r,It may seem like an unpopular opinion here but take as much math as you can. True you may not need tensor analysis when isolating your proteins or whatever but what people overlook is that math teaches you how to approach and solve problems and is indispensable if you aim to truly study the natural universe like a scientist. There are several resources online you can learn from MIT open courseware Khan academy etc. Learning math can only help you the same goes for Physics. ,Biochemistry,cicxl9p,1,t5_2qwl1

2869731,0,t3_2szdit,First of all I would say you do indeed need to make sure your mental health is taken care of being a student is very stressful and can uncover underlying depressionanxiety.With that out of the way here are some tips from a person near the completion of a biochemistry degree with about  months of in lab experience.You say you are bored by the monotonousness of lab work ie just doing procedures. What people often fail to realize when they start lab work is they will be doing the most routine tasks e.g. simple PCR procedures SDS PAGE etc. Once you get deeper into your own research project as you would as say a grad student or summer research student you will find you need to use those building blocks to put together more complex andor nuanced experiments. Furthermore as you mature as a scientist a great deal of the challenge and satisfaction in science comes not from performing a procedure but looking at a problem you want to solve and applying the techniques you know to gain useful insight. You say you enjoy to a reasonable degree mathematics. If you have an interest in physics you may be able to use that math skill to get your foot in the door in the biophysics field . Biophysics is a relatively new field and uses physical principles mathematicalcomputer models etc. to solve biological problems. And as always remember you have options. Some people think academic scienceindustrial technician jobs are the end all and be all for biochemists. But options exist in business writing and consulting  for individuals with science expertise.Sometimes from so close it seems like dropping out ofswitching trajectories in school is the end of the world. Its not. I hope you come to a decision that lets you sleep well. ,Biochemistry,cnuaf8p,3,t5_2qwl1

The theory is still the same so if you did well in orgo lab classes you should be fine. Another main difference between O.
