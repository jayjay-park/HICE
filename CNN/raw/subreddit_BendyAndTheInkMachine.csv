Unless you have played it before then I suggest playing it again turning up your sound,BendyAndTheInkMachine,dgg961z,1,t5_3j1q3

Hell prolly be your friend right up until you and him get the lift on something will probably happen to Boris your now only friend and youll miss the lift and Bendyll probably break it leading to chapter  happening. Its a bit of a specific prediction but knowing storytelling I believe strongly that something like that will happen as Boris seems to be happy with Henrys presence which could also lead Bendy to think of Boris as one of the traitors.,BendyAndTheInkMachine,dgge4s3,3,t5_3j1q3
