794397,0,t1_cgukj78,I live in it. Im leaving due to an unexpected family issue. But have no problems with the job Ive been doing. I just dont get why I the conservative leaning person is embracing the change and progress while you the progressive leaning person is rejecting and trying to stop or slow the change. Like it or dont the oil industry is here to stay. It wont be leaving anytime soon. And it will bring many changes and much revenue. Yall just gonna have to deal with it. Just like we southerners had to deal with nafta when it closed all the textile mills in the south and people who had worked generations at the mill all had to get out and learn new skills and trades. Good luck on adjusting. I mean that. North Dakota is a beautiful and industrialist place. I only see good things in yalls future if you embrace it.  ,SouthDakota,cgukrhy,1,t5_2qsoy

3176134,0,t1_coqwls0,How about you read my comment and recognize that I didnt say I was against gay marriage interracial marriage etc. I simply stated that if the th Circuits decision is not favorable to the Plaintiffs that there would be a mess. Many marriages would have to be voided. That makes no sense. Wait until the decision is handed down.I expect the SCOTUS decision that is expected in late June on th Circuit cases out of TN OH MI and KY may make this appeal moot. That is only  months away.
