16254,0,t1_ceg96oy,Thanks so much for the help. One more question should my feet be pointing towards my opponent? And is my front foot meant to be directly in front of my rear leg?  the toes of my rear foot point to the heel of my front foot or should my feet be parallel under my shoulders? Thanks,WingChun,cega903,2,t5_2qkn0

181497,0,t3_1w56jo,Doesnt seem practical to force being on alternate gates inside and outside. Also doesnt seem practical to try to switch up footwork every time your opponent switches a gate. Involves either a fighting to get in a certain position rather than hitting your opponent. And b uprooting your structure every time your gates are switched.,WingChun,cez3xt8,2,t5_2qkn0

235597,0,t1_cf3y52i,You know I thought about this and while I dont actually like fighting that much and so am unable to say that other people are far more skilled that myself I think that perhaps even mastering I hate that word Wing Chun does not give one the necessary skill level to compete against someone who has the same skill level in another martial art. Personally this doesnt dull the usefulness of Wing Chun for me as a philosophy and training regimen but I can see why someone would choose another martial art for that reason. tldr Some mountaintops are not as high as others but can be just as challenging and rewarding to climb.,WingChun,cf563vk,1,t5_2qkn0

1139158,0,t1_chxoing,gt I will certainly look into a wall bag if you think it might help. Will need to read into using them a little bit to get the most out of it at first. Well again its best to get someone to teach you how to use it. Whats good about the wall bag though is that you can practice your basic punch plus its really cheap to buy. gt The instructors at our local academy focus on Gracie Jiu Jitsu. They have  black belt instructors there and only one of them does JKD and the JKD class is one day a week. I know quite a few people study BJJ with Wing Chun. Apparently it compliments it very well and it helps cover ground work which is absent from WC.gt Is there any resources out there that I may be able to use that you are aware of to find someone a bit closer?Forums local ads kijiji and word to mouth. It might be worth just to asking around. A teacher might be in the area who doesnt have a school.gt Is there any books out there you might recommend Beyond the Pointing Fingers  No techniques the books is about Wong Shung Leung and his philosophy on Wing Chun and Combat. Wing Chun Compendium Vol  It has techniques but it also has a lot of good philosophy. Its a good book for beginners.  Tao of Jeet Kune Do If youre going to study JKD might as well read up on it.

Plain and simple and quite a few of the guys that were good at chi sau Ive practiced with werent good at dealing with out fighting styles. I was just making a statement off of my experiences.  The kind of exercise they were doing here was awesome! and very necessary to move forward no matter what level you are.You can practice the same principles of chi sau with out fighting as well but usually it comes later when you start learning more foot work.

5332895,0,t1_cvtbfmo,Im sure if you contact a boxing gym politely saying you just want to get used to training against boxing theyd let you go. It def is aimed at master wong well the nd part atleast. I think its to this video  But the difference between someone who is aware of what a good puncher is like and someone who actually trains is big. I used to spar with my mates who are strong and bigger then me but didnt really have any formal training but compared to my mate now who actually has been boxing  times a week including sparring classes only since the beggining of this year  he is way harder to spar  the difference is huge. and hes smaller then me. My first Sifus techniques could work decently against my old sparring pals but once I started vsing my current mate every week got harder and harder. Right now we go toe to toe though but It took some effort. Changed school and changed the way i thought about fighting and training. You have to be realistic I watch ufc and think  would this work against these guys? and if it doesnt then whats the point of training it to a high level?

9730200,0,t1_dacffnu,haha  yes very much more than that.  Structure stability redirection of energy energy conservation sensitivity and more.The type of sparring you describe is thuggish brawling.  It works well for larger guys and is as much about how many punches you can take as it is how skilled you are.Dont misunderstand me I have respect for the accomplishments of MMA fighters they are incredible warriors.  I wouldnt last long against one and as you may know at the top end of MMA WC does not really appear.For me however I have a respectable job I live in a respectable neighbourhood and Im raising my children.  Im not making suggestions that these things are incompatible with MMA but I have no desire to come home in pain bruisedbatteredbroken.  I chose a system that promotes self defence over competition.  If I get into a violent situation it will most likely be with an untrained aggressor and Wing Chun does more than fine in that scenario.  I train as hard as I can at my kwoon and I have great faith in my Sifu.Putting Wing Chun aside for a moment I think youll find most single focus martial arts schools e.g. karate TKD an acceptable choice.  Anything with a little authentic culture is likely a going to be a step away from the brawling youre used to.That said choose Wing Chun!

10181229,0,t1_dby0fp0,gt I dont know why youre saying boxing is useful if somebody comes up and grabs a boxer by the collar its already outside of what you learn when you learn to box. Im pretty sure OP is referring to the fact that its easy to find several video examples of people who are obviously boxers doing well in street fights. Here are a few well known examplesNotice how all of those situations are well outside the comfort zone of regular boxing. The best matchup for the boxer among these videos is a vs and people constantly try to grapple or bring in improvised weapons.I found these three videos in a quick YouTube search. I could easily provide videos for Judo or wrestling as well. Ill include this one form Judo brause its my favourite. But for Kung Fu theres not a lot to be found especially if you are looking for just Wing Chun.Now the interesting question is why this is the case. I agree with you that training specifically for a street fight situation should prepare you well better for street fights than standard boxing training. The problem is that the data we have doesnt necessarily show this. Its not like we definitely can say that Wing Chun will not work in a street fight but as far as videos are concerned we have not got any positive evidence that it does. I suspect boxing wrestling and Judo being more common has something to do with the higher numbers of positive examples they produce but Wing Chun is probably the most widely available Kung Fu style that is taught for street defense.To an extend I agree with you. There are a lot of situations in a street fight that boxers should not be able to handle. But the evidence we have surprisingly shows boxers still doing very well. Its puzzling that boxing works as well as it does given the limited amount of tools it provides you with but it is what we see.EDIT Hopefully fixed the video links that were not working for some people.,WingChun,dby3kb5,6,t5_2qkn0
10350683,0,t1_dch708e,It wouldnt be bad but fantastic. However Wing Chun is a very specialized system honed in Foshan China during a very violent time in Chinese history. The primary martial art Wing Chun was defending against this might be controversial was Choy Li Fut with sweeping circular motions. No one grappled there. Now do I think a Wing Chun fighter should learn to grapple? I do! In fact my instructor has a black belt in BJJ from Carlson Gracie. Amusingly Carlson trained with him Sifu Phillip Nearing to reciprocate and learn Wing Chun. Also sometimes our Sifu brings in the pros who train the Chicago Police Department on hand to hand against Knives and we do seminars on knife fighting as well.My point is that if you want to be a good fighter you need to be well rounded. Wing Chun with a skilled practicioner can be a deadly and violent stand up martial art. That being said youll want to do grappling and maybe even kick boxing in addition. Wing Chun has a few close range kicks but doesnt teach you how to use your most powerful muscles in your body your legs to standoff from an opponent compared to Muay Thai Tae Kwon Do Savate Krav Maga etc.Wing Chun shouldnt change because you dont fully understand what it is good for. You should understand what it is good for so you can use what makes sense when it needs to be used. If youre looking for everything in a single martial art perhaps lookup Dan Inosanto or his badass daughter Diana! and do some Jeet Kun Do or go to Israel and learn some Krav Maga.,WingChun,dchb65z,3,t5_2qkn0
10400102,0,t1_dcmuh1g,Thanks I like going around testing my skills too so it really is a win win situation on my side lol. Also you get to show off your sick battle wounds I definately DONT think apologizing wouldve changed anything. Take into consideration demographics it was around  pm in a location known to house delinquent druggies crooks alchoholics etc. This alone says a lot about the area and its personality.I would totally be angry if someone knocked me over and stared at me too but we also need to think about why his friends reacted that way. Lets say you and two friends are walking down a street and one gets bumped over is your first reaction haha you idiot let him get up and continue doing whatever you were doing oh dude are you alright helps him up and continue... fuck your mom throws punchI personally would settle for the first two unless I just wanted to start a fight real bad. Which looking at the history of violence in the area is not so surprising.Finally did I bump him or did he bump me?I dont know if youre taught this but my Wing Chun has something called rooting where I am able to maintain my balance when a force tries to offset me. When that guy and I collided imagine two people just walking into each other at the exact same speed and shoulder bumping my first reaction was to root as to not get offset remember I wasnt having a good day so I kept pushing forward he returned the force and it was a stalemate of shoulder pushing until I used his force against him and launched him back a bit. It wasnt my intention to knock him over guess he tripped or something. At this point I was actually already in fight or flight this sounds mystical and all but its like I could feel his aggression so..,WingChun,dcmx2ef,1,t5_2qkn0
10510029,0,t3_5qhtex,The school looks pretty cool.  Id go for it if I were you.  Ip Man had many many students.  Unfortunately I dont think there is anything for martial arts like the Mathematics Genealogy Project so you cant know from that.  However I am a firm believer that the proof is in the teaching.  If you go there and it feels like bullshit dont go.  It doesnt mean that it is bullshit it just means that no matter how legit it is you arent going to get anything out of it.A month of trying out is a good idea.  Not only does Sifu want to make sure youre not a crazy person looking for more effective ways to bully and hurt people but it will help you figure out if Ving Tsun this is how they spell Wing Chun in the Ip Man lineage according to the Wing Chun Compendium is right for you.  A month is needed because probably youll spend your first few classes on stances and basicskinda boringand then after a few weeks is when things get interesting Practicing with others sticky hands etc.  If you already have a lot of theoretical knowledge and youre sure that Ving Tsun is how you want to train a month helps to feel out if the culture of the gwan and Sifus personality suit you...and also the commute if thats an issue.  I think it has something to do with a mental transition too.  If you pay from the getgo it sets you up to feel like a customer who is entitled to getting what he expects out of a product.  With a free month you feel like Sifu is giving you his time for free your Ving Tsun family is giving you their attention for free and youre attending classes of your own free will not because of any Sunk Cost Fallacy involving money.  By the end of the month or whenever you start paying a fee you no longer feel that it is money that buys a product you feel as if it is your contribution for the upkeep of the gwan and the maintenance of your Sifu. Its not a health club or a fight club its a family.    ,WingChun,dczf93q,7,t5_2qkn0
10648388,0,t1_ddadxpe,Chi sau is as different from sparrring as sparring is completely different from a real fight. The closest thing we have to mimicking a real fight and practicing for it is to spar. Chi sau is with a compliant partner who never disengages and only works within the realm of wing chun motions. ,WingChun,ddeas1i,1,t5_2qkn0
10652696,0,t1_ddamau1,The forms are more distant from real fighting than shadow boxing but it seems to me that pretending to hit and be hit ends up being way different than actually getting hit. Im not saying there isnt something to be gained just that its different. If youre mindful of that fact you can still get a lot out of practice.Secondly practicing the forms is a neverending sequence. I still make constant adjustments to my stance and root and hand positions even  years after learning the first form. So first you get comfortable and by that I mean that your body and mind are in sync making the movements secondnature and then you work on perfecting the movements. If youre good youll work on perfecting the movements until you die of old age.,WingChun,ddeqs6k,1,t5_2qkn0
10831082,0,t3_5uusbu,Its interesting how Ip Mans hips seem more tucked forward like he sits forward on them whereas Bruce Lees are mostly straight. Obviously wed have to see this in motion to judge the pics might have been taken during transition.,WingChun,ddx5em4,4,t5_2qkn0

11646564,0,t3_6673u4,The feedback of a wooden dummy allows one more efficient development of their inch power there really isnt something else like that.You could however stick a few pvc pipes around to get the right position of the dummy. You wont be training the dummy youd be more like training for training the dummy if you get what im saying.Unless you have a real dummy youre not gonna get all the benefits.,WingChun,dgg5h6o,1,t5_2qkn0
