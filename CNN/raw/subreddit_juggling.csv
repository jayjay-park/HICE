1840574,0,t1_ckax00t,This could go in the other thread I started on progressions but here are some simple b progressions for learning the b cascade. Both start with a base pattern of six s in a row but what that really means is this out of a b fountain do one cycle of the embedded siteswap and then take as many throws of the b fountain as you need to recover good control of the b fountain then do the embedded siteswap again. Eventually youll get to where you can reliably do just  fountain throws between cycles of the embedded siteswap ss gt ss gt ss gt ss ss gt ss gt ss gt ssI can bet that the above is not already too easy otherwise youd be making good progress on the b cascade now.If they are all too hard then work on the b progressions. In fact if any of the b progressions is not easy you should be spending practice time working on them ss gt ss gt ss      this should already be very easy ss gt ss gt ss ss gt ss gt ssFind the spots in the progressions where you struggle to reliably run one step in the progression even though you can reliably run the previous step. Spend your practice time at those spots about  minutes per day.If you do the above you should notice some improvement each week  even if it is just qualitative progress i.e. it feels better even though you arent yet getting longer runs. If you dont notice improvement each week then there may be a problem with your mechanics that is holding you back.

First of buy a clear plastic ball close to this then drill a small hole into the ball. place a bright led connected its battery and button inside and then pull the button through the hole you drilled.Seal the ball shut with some pvc cement. Next then drill a small hole into the ball now fill the ball with some clear beads like these through the hole where the button is make sure you shake the ball so the led is in the middle. Next hot glue as far deep into the ball as you can and push the button back into the hole and seal it so it is snug.Repeat for the others!!,juggling,ckdvlsz,2,t5_2qs90
1866766,0,t3_2fy6in,gt Are there some  and  ball tricks that you think form important foundations for more advanced stuff? If you could start again in what order would you learn or would it not matter?With an emphasis on foundations here are some things you should work on. Good mechanics amp form. One juggler widely regarded to have great form is Doug Sayers. Control over throw height tempo amp dwell time. Know the difference between ss ss and ss and understand that in theory you can juggle all three of these with the same throw heights. Do practice high throws i.e. keep trying to extend how high you can throw while maintaining the pattern.. Mastery of the b cascade forward reverse amp tennis variations and the b fountain forward reverse amp columns.. Learn ss and some of its variations. Learn the mills mess and some of its variations. Learn the box ssx and some of its variationsBut with all that said your MO is a good one. Keep doing it too.,juggling,cke514q,6,t5_2qs90

Also learned some unicycling though I used some online tutorials for that I had seen the unicycle level ladder thing.

2012358,0,t1_ckvljc6,I forgot to say that to improve accuracy dont move your feet and learn to  cull a pattern that is getting out of control before you drop.  Moving your feet to continue juggling is just a way to compensate for sloppy throws and gives you and your brain less incentive to make your throws more accurate.To be able to do this you have to make sure that your first  throws are consistently accurate enough that you arent forced to immediately go into recovery mode. So it is worth spending time just flashing until you can flash x in a row without dropping or moving your feet.,juggling,ckvopk4,2,t5_2qs90

3683181,0,t1_cqbzpsp,Actually when I think about it ground state probably means just that it really has to start and finish in ground state including the transition from uniplexing which although I claim means something is only really useful to define in so far as it lets you check the transitions in and out but is otherwise fairly unuseful. Unfortunately validating a ground state multiplex pattern whilst doable is hard to describe generalisably. In short I suspect it would be defined by something approximately as follows the landings at the end must be contiguous for the last n landings and the first n throws mustnt land in any of the first n places n  number of props,juggling,cqc3v57,1,t5_2qs90

4436554,0,t1_cspurav,This trick is stupidly difficult well for the ones I do and for the amount I practice it. I probably practice it every time I juggle seriously which for this trick has been on and off for  years. However yesterday I realised that I was trying to make the pattern lower and faster so I made it a bit higher and slowed the pattern down. This doubled my highest number of catches in one day.  Its been a long time since I started learning it so I cant remember exactly how I began learning but some tips I do have.Reverse  ball fountainAs has been mentioned above cross arm and windmills will be helpfulPractice starting the trick in multiple ways my top  are  As you see in the video the classic multiplex and how I learnt the  ball version probably also how I started the  ball juggle a regular  ball pattern and then using our dominant hand do the under arm throw.You will get lots of collisions when learning this one dont get discouraged by thatI find swaying a little with the pattern helps. At the moment my pattern is quite wide and this helps me keep it tighter. Im working on fixing that issue however the sway adds to the aesthetic of the pattern.Finally it feels slightly different to the  ball version. Crap throw will collide because not every ball is keeping the same throw with  the under arm is always under the over is always over so make sure you have good curve on the underarm throws or it will collide alot.Sorry if its a bit vague but its been awhile since I started learning.  However I do believe that if focused on you can get this far much quicker than I did  ,juggling,cspwvmq,3,t5_2qs90

5833766,0,t1_cxkaqw8,Oh okay I understand So in juggling you can juggle a LOT of things. We call things props.In this subreddit you can see at the right of the page Related Subreddits under Links you will see all the minor props in juggling.The main ones are  balls clubs and rings. They are mainly used for what is called toss juggling. Or object manipulation.Everyone starts with balls because it is much more easy than clubs and rings.So I would recommend you buying a set of balls for each one of you. You can start buying  or  balls for each person.There are a lot of threads on this reddit about choosing the right ball since there are MANY different models ans types.You can not go wrong with good beanbags. Do not buy juggling balls in a toy store or a supermarket they are very cheap will break easily etc.After buying your balls you could also for example buy  clubs for all of you and  rings. Just to see how it is and if you like those props. Notice that clubs are usually gt while good rings are under  cause its just a plastic ring really.So you have your props everyone has balls. You have to learn how tu juggle them.I would HIGHLY suggest this website  you can see that tricks are presented by difficulty so you know how to progress.The very first trick every juggler learns is called the cascade. It is the most basic pattern in juggling you have to learn it to juggle.You can learn it with this super great guy  To finish I chose couple of AWESOME videos from AWESOME jugglers pThey are all very enjoyable to watch !If you have any questions I will answer them ,juggling,cxkc0tm,3,t5_2qs90

7898282,0,t3_4ndriu,I learned to juggle clubs first by just flashing them starting with  throws catches. Try not to move your feet or chest forward to catch them just let them fall if youd have to move. Then once you can do that add  more throw and catch to it. Get good at that and continue to  ect. Ive never done this for clubs but when I learned  balls I would stand in front of a wall so I didnt have the option to move forward maybe that will work with clubs too?Most likely you start going forward when you throw with your nondominate hand. So focus on that hand.As for your hands Ive never had that problem of friction only when my hands get sweaty the clubs would just slide out I hold my clubs pretty lightly though. Hard to answer this question without knowing how your throws become off. Do you mean they spin to muchlittle go to forward?Best Of Luck!,juggling,d43u9uo,2,t5_2qs90

9656416,0,t3_5da2v5,Do you not have any idea of skills you want to own any idea on tricks that youve seen others do that you might like to do yourself too any movements styles cool stuff that youd like to get into? .. I mean it is an individual thing after all.Which picture do you have in mind when you say solo stuff  solo skills? What strikes you or could you fancy fill out those blank list entries in your bank of tricks.     What I see from you mentioning skills related to passing clubs and from do four balls and some simple tricks  bodythrows is to try out anything there is with  clubs wouldnt be all new to you and  balls  siteswap and to check out more other bodythrows as these seem to suit you. But thats guessing from very far away General advice can only be .. like .. have a priority or two to invest most of your practise time into hard to you stuff or a routine that you absolutely want to own including any goodfors and exercises then a shorter leisurepart to try out anything comes to your mind or crosses your way to see how it suits you.,juggling,da3crxe,2,t5_2qs90
9698408,0,t1_da85bwn,Box is good for this! If you can do this nicely just make your right column throw to crossing throws to the left and continue with the feeding throws from the left. This may take a while.,juggling,da8ja6j,1,t5_2qs90
9901675,0,t1_day3r2o,nice gif!im surprised at a couple things in the video. the club record is only  passes? with all the great  club jugglers i wouldve thought this would be higher. all of the patterns use a line without dropback. i wouldve thought dropback would be easier since you dont have a blind catch.,juggling,day7m4b,2,t5_2qs90

10164284,0,t3_5ljckn,Im retyping my original message because it kept duplicating itself.  I was using my Note phone this is my daughters IPad.  I was inspired by the last video poster to make my own video.  I have previously asked questions here about juggling and Im enjoying juggling.  I asked my wife to record me but I dropped on the fountain.  I had to self record myself I apologize about my video quality it will get better as well as my juggling.  It took me about  runs to get all  segments without a drop I dont know how to edit videos so dropping was not an option.  I can also juggle  clubs.,juggling,dbw6euj,2,t5_2qs90

10265014,0,t1_dc7htct,Theres a big difference between filming a difficult trick for a video and filming an hour long practice session. You usually see me get excited for trick shots  half of that is excitement for finally getting it the other half is showmanship for the video. ,juggling,dc7lftl,8,t5_2qs90

11113298,0,t3_5yhbkh,What you want is balls that have high contrast against the background.  If you juggle outdoors a lot youll find it makes a big difference whether it is a clear or overcast day. I found that the best contrast under all conditions is  panel bags with  white and  black panels.  ,juggling,derolj0,1,t5_2qs90
11146104,0,t3_5ytfuh,Great ball video. Hes particularly good at timing the pattern so both a thrown and carried ball have  velocity at the same time. Not sure how to better describe that technique its a similar concept to the tower patterns but you have more possibilities for the pattern shape because youre carrying one of the balls. ,juggling,devedkq,1,t5_2qs90
