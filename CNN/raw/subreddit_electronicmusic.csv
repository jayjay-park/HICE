137917,0,t1_cetxbd0,I agree with everything you said and blkmarketverbotenresolute parties are different ballgames... the  day straight NYE party that blkmarket threw at output.. awesome. The vibe at output is so incredbile.. . the people are music fans the staff are nice the DJs bring their top games the tertiary vibes in the panther room and roof are perfect... i always meet up people from all over the world there and i usually catch a friend or two i didnt know was going or make new friends in the area. the only place that was in the same stratosphere as output is sometimes cielo and at times good units before they shut it down im also only  so my experience only goes back a few years.edit I went through your comment history and its always fun to encounter someone who runs in the same scenecircles in the same area. NYC is truly the heart of underground dance music or at least deeptech in the united states. though I have to say I did you see output has by far the best system in NYC and I think cielo might have something to say about that i miss the d system though that club turned into a shitshowand even though its a terrible awful club and somewhere id almost never want to be pacha does have a pretty good soundsystem. whoops didnt mean to hijack this and turn it into general talk about the NYC scene,electronicmusic,ceu509e,2,t5_2qmh1

335752,0,t1_cffk8da,This has nothing to do with the topic and why would you not support an artist you like by going to their show where other people like the same artist as well. I think its silly to just go to a club where others also might not enjoy that artist. Not to mention many clubs dont have shiny stage presence and custom dj booths. Not sure how going to shows is American either Im a little confused by that. This just seems very hypocritical too where you talk about going to clubs and not following the crowd yet the only two shows youve been to are by some of the biggest DJs in the world.Dont get me wrong I love Tiesto and Armin I just think this post is insanely silly and hypocritical. Also lots of club music is not about releasing a lot of times its a nice beat to dance to. Excision and Dirtyphonics arent exactly club music.,electronicmusic,cffkk7h,1,t5_2qmh1

Hell if you pulled that kind of disrespectful behaviour at a rock or metal show in this town you would have some nice strong gentlemen take you aside for a firm polite word.I feel for all you wonderful people in America who have to put up with the huge downsides of dance music being in the spotlight. You need to start putting on smaller parties outside of the mainstream where you can go and actually enjoy the music. Even when our scene turned to crap about  years ago with the summer of love ravers finally retiring and the later generations not pulling their weight by putting on parties to keep the noncommercial traditions alive you at least had space to dance.,electronicmusic,cffn8br,6,t5_2qmh1

607636,0,t1_cg9ao4m,Sure certain parts of it definitely sound like theyre straight out of the s but this song has got so much complexity and substance.And for what its worth this song is a great example of early stutter edit which BT pioneered.  Hes got much more of it in his later work and even wrote his own proprietary software for the effect.gt In nature if you examine the sound of a cricket its an incredible train of exponential pulses thats how that sound is made. You can also organise a sound like that so I began to look at the wave form of a door creaking or rain thinking what if you took some of these things that are happening organically in nature taking infinitesimal sounds and repeating them almost in the audio range  but not quite below  Hz  and then playing around with simple maths things like exponential and algorithmic applications of the spacing of the notes hamming curves and other mathematical gestures to make these stutter edit and nanorhythmic sounds. Both on this album and particularly This Binary Universe you can hear me exploring those things. Some of them are better looked at than listened to if you look at it you will have a holy shit moment because theres so much thought put into it that you cant just get from hearing  its clearly visual too.ESCM is a beautiful album.,electronicmusic,cg9cado,3,t5_2qmh1

The song was produced by group members Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann under their production alias Bobbydazzler for the groups debut album Since I Left You. The song is built around many sampled elements much like other tracks from its parent album including prominent vocal samples of comedy duo Wayne and Shuster and an orchestral background sourced from an Enoch Light version of the composition ampquotMy Way of Lifeampquot . It was released on  August  as the second single from Since I Left You. Upon release it peaked at number  on the UK Singles Chart and number  in the groups native Australia becoming their first single to enjoy commercial success. ampquotFrontier Psychiatristampquot was well received by music critics who praised the Avalanches utilization of samples in making the song.  Background  According to group members ampquotFrontier Psychiatristampquot was not planned beforehand by the group and in his words ampquotjust happened from us just fucking around.ampquot Group members Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann were driving figures in the production of the albums songs spending months scouring Melbournes ampquotold record stores for old recordsampquot and spending hours sampling music from the records they found to create the songs on the album. The duo primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix  and Akai S samplers. Dexter Fabay turntablist and keyboardist for the band brainstormed the idea for ampquotFrontier Psychiatristampquot and his scratching abilities are heard prominently on the song.  Composition  ampquotFrontier Psychiatristampquot is built around several elements sampled from other music Chater and Seltmann who produced the song sampled music from several vinyl records in the production and creation of the songs from Since I Left You. The song also makes prominent use of scratching done by the bands turntablist Dexter Fabay. The prominent orchestral sample heard throughout the track is sourced from a recording by the Enoch Light Singers of the  composition ampquotMy Way of Lifeampquot originally composed by Bert Kaempfert Herbert Rehbein and Carl Sigman. The track also contains several vocal samples of Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster the most prominent of these samples taken from the duos comedy routine ampquotFrontier Psychiatristampquot Only the aforementioned two samples are credited in the liner notes of Since I Left You various other uncredited samples are used in the song with sources ranging from golf instructionals Christianity records and ampquotReading for the Blindampquot tapes. The spoken sample at the beginning ampquotIs Dexter ill?ampquot comes from the John Waters film Polyester followed by Maurice Jarres overture from Lawrence of Arabia. The closing mariachi band played ampquotEl negro Zumbonampquot first performed by Silvana Mangano in the movie Anna.  Music Video  The songs music video directed by Kuntz and Maguire features various characters reenacting and playing various elements of the track including vocal samples violins horns and drums. The video was released to critical acclaim. The video was the runnerup in the ampquotBest Music Videoampquot category at the  Rushes Soho Shorts Film Festival. Pitchfork Media placed the video at  on their list of the ampquotTop  Music Videos of the sampquot. An alternative video was made featuring actors acting out the dialogue of the track in various scenes including a psychiatrists office and ampquotDextersampquot bedroom. In addition Rorschach inkblots are animated to reflect various samples in the track.|  |images|album image  |links|lyrics wikipedia allmusic discogs official homepage youtube myspace twitter facebook album on amazon  |tags|electronica turntablism triphop  Please downvote this comment if this data is incorrect!

1298456,0,t3_28yjg2,RichFrom the beginning of your career you were known as someone who always pushed the envelope creatively purely from a music point of view starting from FUSESheet One all the way to DECloser.We all know you are a master at marketing ENTER the Cube CNTRL tour etc. but do you think that has gotten in the way at all of the music?  Is it possible for you to continue pushing musical boundaries with so much focus on everything else?  I understand you probably view it as one encompassing vision but I cant help but think that the music side of Richie Hawtin may have taken a back seat to the entertainer side of Richie Hawtin for the past  or so years.Also wanted to add in that the parties dont feel the same today as they did from  or so years ago. For example I felt that the most recent Control party at City Club in  didnt have the magic that the Control parties from the early s had. Did you sense the same thing? Im not sure anyone wants any artist to simply recreate something from their past but its the magic thats been lacking in my opinion as of late. I think in the end it all comes down to the music Thanks for answering hope to see you soon in ChicagoDetroit,electronicmusic,cifoykr,48,t5_2qmh1
1300132,0,t3_28yjg2,Richie you are truly an inspiration for what we do and what we try and represent with our concept Top Notch Vibes.  I got to experience you play a set at the Westcott Theater at Syracuse University headlining an evening with Paco Osuna and Loco Dice and there was maybe  people in the building.  That helped jumpstart my love for techno and I have gotten the privilege to see you close out festivals such as Sonar  and Tomorrowland .  I am sure that Im not the only person you truly inspired on that college tour.  Do you have any more plans to educate college aged kids in the future?  Also with your ENTER project how long did it take to firmly build the basis of the concept?  And how many people did it take to believe in your concept before you took it off to the next step?  I am fascinated with the process of building a concept many people believe in and consistently improvingbettering the experience.

Both of them have a real mastery of creating a specific soundmood for every album they make. Obviously The Avalanches is up there too. Portishead. The Juan Macleans new album is looking to be really well produced and composed. Rusties new album too has that sort of feel of a cohesive album and not just a collection of singles if you want something hardermore abrasive.My favorite album of last year is also one of the best composed Ive heard in years DJ Koze  Amygdala.

1823282,0,t3_2fg8le,gtOPENING is a visual album created by Christopher Willits. It is a min film a CDLP released on Ghostly International and CDDVD released on Plancha in Japan a series of photo prints and live performances. OPENING is best described as an experience designed to inspire a space of peace and expansion. Willits music and photographic filmmaking overlap into a kind of abstract narrative speaking to personal transformation and connection to the earth. Willits will be performing the sounds and images of OPENING live in the US and Europe this fall while on tour with Tycho.gtFor years Ive imagined the work I do in music photography videofilm immersive audio and meditation all coming into one space says musicart guru Christopher Willits from his home in San Francisco. Its an ambition that seems especially befitting of a worldly polymath like Willits. Sound and light can transform and inspire our imaginations he continues. It can be used as a tool to awaken our consciousness. And that is exactly what he has set out to do with OPENING the veteran Ghostly artists new immersive audiovisual project.gtAcross seven tracks of widescreen ambient music  minutes of visuals shot over four years in multiple countries seven photographs and a multisensory multiple channel live performance Willits has created something which might better be thought of as an experience than a simple album. OPENING features Willits latest music since Ancient Future his  collaboration with Japanese pianist Ryuichi Sakamoto and his recent production and mastering work on Tychos Awake. The vibrant enveloping sounds weve come to expect from him are on full display. The quiet majesty of Vision ushers us into the sacred world Willits creates a living universe that billows and heaves alongside slowgrooving songs like Clear and Connect or with the textural minutiae and harmonic subtleties in Ground and Now. Closing out the album Wide and Release offer the listener a gentle comedown through  minutes of transcendent audio with Willits delicate guitar manipulations breathing life into the aether of finely textured atmospheres and softglowing synths.gtThe other integral facet to the experience of OPENING is Willits visual work. After building a library of images from his travels around California Hawaii Japan and Thailand Willits is unveiling an abstract narrative film with seven scenes that correspond with the seven songs from the album along with seven limited edition photo prints. The minute film interfuses music and a firstperson perspective of meditative scenes  inspiring nature sections reminiscent of the films Baraka Koyaanisqatsi and Planet Earth  to create the space of OPENING.gtWillits says There are no actors or dialogue in this film. The audience and their perception is the main character and everyones imagination is going to create some meaning thats relevant to their own experience. My intention is to create a space where people can open up and expand into relax and recharge. OPENING is unlike anything Willits has accomplished before perhaps because the audiovisual project is about expanding ones mind to invite something new. Or as Willits puts it For me OPENING is about transformation the experience of changing oneself to be more of who you know you can be and ultimately the joy that comes with that change.Short documentary on the making Download OPENING  Project site  Buy the Album  not working for Ghostly just want to share this,electronicmusic,ck8w8dj,1,t5_2qmh1

1930099,0,t3_2grdvu,gt I just talked about this with a friend the most inspiring moment I witnessed as a kid was when I was about thirteen years old and I was watching to Rock School on BBC. It was an educative program where youngsters were being explained how to make music. In that particular episode there was a demonstration by Vince Clark the original synthplayer of Depeche Mode later Yazoo and Erasure. He was surrounded by synths and was making a track. It really was a eurekamoment. What I remembered the most was that there was a coffees mug on his computer next to that a Happy Shopperbag. I didnt know this type of world existed. Heres someone in a room full of synths it looked like just his own fucking room hes drinking tea he just went to a shop to get himself a cake and he makes a track in five minutes. When I saw that I knew it thats the life I want! That excerpt is my biggest inspiration ever. Not that I didnt like his music I did but I was mainly in love with his lifestyle. Making music from the security of your own room that was my dream and Ive realized that years ago.Full interview,electronicmusic,cklrguu,4,t5_2qmh1

2172288,0,t1_clfkt47,Your version doesnt have  pitch heres correct slow version the one which appeared on major New Beat Compilations. And heres original fast version for comparison.As for the whole genre it was probably the most diverse dance scene of last  years. It not only merged Acid House with Electronic Body Music but also was influenced by Detroit Techno HiNRG SynthPop and even Italo Disco. It lived for like  years and instead of dying it quickly transformed into Belgian Techno Rave which later gave birth to harder genres like Hard Trance or Gabber.The music itself wasnt so complex in structure however it was deeply soaked in s atmosphere not the bright colorful one but more darker side filled with sex and campiness. Many tracks feel being taken straight out action movies of that era.Soulwax some time ago did a wonderful video set of New Beat Scene after I saw it got me momentally obsessed over it.

A lot of people will confuse DJs for producers and vice versa but I still think they are two separate things. edit or they assume its the same thingAnnie Mac comes to mind as someone who only DJs and either shes never produced anything or never produced anything popular. People know her because shes a DJ and radio personality at BBC Radio  but she still goes on tours and plays festivals. Most artists who play festivals I would consider them to be producers who can also DJ. They either end up doing a live set a DJ set or a mixture of both because theyre flexible with both.

You wanted a record player? You got a Technics. When cds and digital became much more prevalent past ca.  these stores suffered quickly. Out of those other three most of the times two would be second hand stores with little to no new releases. The last store would be your bigger franchise record stores with majority of cds and a little vinyl corner at best.And a digital album will cost you  usually but an recent LP will set you back . Different location different circumstances. Vinyl culture here has been synonymous with djing since the late s. Vinyl was the only medium to get electronic music.,electronicmusic,cnlx8bh,2,t5_2qmh1

The statements you make clearly communicate that you have no sense of how deep their back catalogue is or have any idea for what the creative sense and direction of the band is.    Mushroom is hands down one of the most influential electronic artists ever of all time. Undoubtedly. They have influenced every single producer that you listen to I can almost guarantee it. They have every right to make and experiment with whatever kind of music they want it is how they became who they are and they have a better track record at doing it than  of producers out there.    And to everyone saying that Infected is done and is going to fade away you are so wrong. They are in the process of completing another double sided Converting Vegetariansesque album. They are about to premier a new live setup and tour with their band. They have expressed interest in making at least  more albums of other styles as well inlcuding continuing with heavier music.

3133842,0,t1_comt5ro,This song and this song are not on equal playing fields. The first track is noticeably more narrow in stereo width if you cant hear that than I guess theres no point in continuing this conversation since that would mean that you have major hearing damage the highs on the Audien track are much more pronounced more crisp and clear and the track is much much louder I can provide a link that explains why humans generally prefer music louder but I think we both know that youre being disingenuous when you say that this isnt generally the case its not objectively true but there is science behind why it is usually true. You may like the more vintage fuzzy weathered sound better but as far as audio engineering is concerned and what is deemed a good mix by most audio engineers we have much higher quality music now than we ever have even despite the loss of dynamics. ,electronicmusic,comtjke,1,t5_2qmh1

Theres tons of better vocalists than Beiber out there.I dont care if my opinion of Diplo gets on your nerves either.  Theres no excuse for that kind of behavior.  It doesnt belong in the rave scene its the act of a prima donna with their head up their ass.If you like their music thats fine but its not part of electronic music and rave culture.

3864364,0,t1_cqwhsfl,I think youd come to enjoy guettas recent work if you really studied pop music as a genre and maybe tried to write a few commercial pop tracks and grew to enjoy it for what it is. In the context of pop tracks Titanium for example is a masterpiece. Its a bunch of positive enjoyable catchy energy in a  minute piece.  Of course coming from an electronic music background at present youre going to be listening to and judging them based on how they conform to the proper electronic tracks they sound so similar to. To me thats the completely wrong way to go about it. Youre never going to enjoy the tracks that way  you just find ways they arent right. The challenge you face is no different than someone from a pure classical music background listening to Massive Attacks Unfinished Symphony. Even though it has some similarities to classical music with orchestral strings pianos and percussion theyre really going to struggle to enjoy it. We know its a masterpiece but judged from a classical standpoint its a car crash. Edit But as someone else has mentioned Love Dont Let Me Go is bloody awesome!,electronicmusic,cqwrsv7,3,t5_2qmh1

Who is really behind Blackeight  The Silence track? I remember hearing it in Roxy and it was IDID for looooooooong time. Why was your remix never released? . What do you likedislike about todays EDM scene and what do you miss about the good ol days?. Any plans to do vinyl onlyclassic nights  where you play out entire tracks sans Abletonreal time remixing or is it not feasible these days? . Do you use analog synths in your productions? Whats your go to favorite pieces of kit? . With so many nights playing loud music  any lasting effects on your hearing? .

4046116,0,t1_crhgwbc,He has said that he didnt enjoy his early work as much and mostly made it to make money.  Ironically while his newer stuff might sound like chart fodder he enjoys producing that kind of music more.The dude makes pop music but imo its not bad.  He knows how to make a hit theres something to be said for that.   Months broke Michael Jacksons records for top  hits off an album no small achievement.gtHis newer stuff is just  straight up disposable billboard chart fodder. As was his old stuff.  As I said hes a pop artist.  He makes and has always made music to top charts and be played on the radio.    Just because you personally and I agree with you think his early work was fun and different doesnt change that fact I dont think its fair to say the guy is a sellout.And he still has it in him to make some decent tracks.  Slow Acid is a badass song if more people were listening to it I guarantee he would crank out some more creatively challenging stuff but its not what the people want.,electronicmusic,crhhkb0,3,t5_2qmh1

They fell into running DJ sets not what they want to do. I think their hiatus if this article is anything to go by has been built around constructing a setup that is raw and anything but two DJ decks and a laptopgtWere trying to make a setup that can fuck up says Keeler.

6842181,0,t1_d0ruo88,I cant give you an answer specific to Above amp Beyond because Im not familiar with all of their different mixes.  In general I would stay away from mixes that are only slightly different like radioclub edits. Its best to stick with the main version. If a song had a mix that you consider to be significantly different than the original and that is the song you want to make the list then put that one. I have two versions of On A Good Day because they are pretty different and I like both but definitely prefer one. I also voted for both versions of With You Friends on the Skrillex thread because I think they are his two best songs.

If its not what they like theyll put down whatever you like hoping youll start posting and liking what they like. The truth is their negativity usually means I wont be listening to anything they like and in the off chance that I do Ill probably start off disliking it because it is now associated with an asshole and who wants to be like an asshole? I think that people forget that music is alot like food. We all need it we all have it and some of us like different things than others. Not everyone likes MampMs Zedd does though  . Not everyone likes Pepperoni Pizza. Hell on top of that not everyone eats the same way. I really wish we as a music culture would get away from this custom of putting someone elses tastes down.

In this modern day and age where money is such a motivation for so many people its really refreshing to see you give away your music for free.  I love knowing that you have carefully crafted each and every song. I love that you travel to collaborate with different artists to collect sounds vibes and different influences.  I feel like a lot of artists have a very cookie cutter model these days and its nice to see somebody that is honing their craft in such a thoughtful and positive way.

I couldnt even deal..He quickly has become my favorite DJ ahead of Prydz and Sub Focus. I just saw him in DC at U St Music Hall and it was nothing short of amazing. The venue was great I was  feet from him. He played this track too and I died right there on the dancefloor.

10461350,0,t3_5pqc2c,This is why a lot of European DJs use SD cards instead of flash drives. This is a somewhat commonish occurance in Europe unfortunately. Also let this be a lesson as to why you should ALWAYS carry a back up flash drive. Its ridiculous for someone at Justins career level to not do that. I think Bassnectar has two identical laptops set up in case one fails. Ive seen too many DJs show up to play and not be able to because their flash drive was corrupted.

10629251,0,t1_ddbt53e,To add to that Kraftwerk together with Can and a few others are considered part of the Dsseldorf School of electronic music contrasted with the Berlin School represented by Klaus Schulze Tangerine Dream Ash Ra Tempel etc who had also already built upon the legacy of Stockhausen Varese and others created the precursors to ambient electronica newage trance and goa. Also important is the early presence of elaborate synthesizer parts in the music of Pink Floyd and Prog Rock in general King Crimson Genesis Yes Rush UK etc before the rise of electronic music.Brian Eno also started releasing electronic music in  and in  released Evening Star with King Crimsons Robert Fripp another defining precursor of later ambient electronic music.So  yeah Id probably name Klaus Schulze amp Kraftwerk as sharing the number one spot.,electronicmusic,ddcbrgr,3,t5_2qmh1

You guys are some of the nicest people Ive met even coming down to the floor and talking to us all afterwards. I was the guy who jumped up on the booth and begged you to play lucid dreams. You guys have been in my all time top favorite producers ever since metropolis. Ive been following you non stop I even got the pleasure of playing some of your music at Mysteryland USA when i was there. I Finally had time to sit down and listen to Glare in full a couple nights ago and I was tweeting about it the entire time. Glare is easily one of my favorite pieces of music now. I couldnt believe the amount of work that went into creating this. It is absolutely a masterpiece in every single way. So thank you. Swardy I asked you if you guys would ever be down to listen to my music and you told me I could message you guys any time and youd try to get back to me.  Since then Ive won two splice remix contests and had an EP released on Gramatiks label. Is there any way I could ever get a hold of you guys to maybe talk music for a bit? Im not here to waste your time I promise. It has been my dream to work with you. ,electronicmusic,delt84q,1,t5_2qmh1

11504160,0,t1_dfzyyzr,Not to give any credit to them as songwriters as Im definitely not a fan but wouldnt a more likely andor interesting interpretation be that it implies the rover was stolen rather than language that glorifies poor financial decision making?

The first time I played it I spent a good  minutes checking needlesampsinterconnects for a fault before just trying a different record. I still wasnt  sure I hadnt got a duff pressing until years later when I finally got my hands on a digital version and it sounded the same.Wake Up is also very good.
