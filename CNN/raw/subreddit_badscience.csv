2004495,0,t1_ckuqn9m,ampampampSection . False explanation based on equal transittime of article  Lift force sfw gtgtBasic or popular sources often describe the Equal TransitTime theory of lift which incorrectly assumes that the parcels of air that divide at the leading edge of an airfoil must rejoin at the trailing edge forcing the air traveling along the longer upper surface to go faster. Bernoullis Principle is then cited to conclude that since the air moves slower along the bottom of the wing the air pressure must be higher pushing the wing up. gtHowever there is no physical principle that requires equal transit time and experimental results show that this assumption is false.       In fact the air moving over the top of an airfoil generating lift moves much faster than the equal transit theory predicts.  Further the theory violates Newtons third law of motion since it describes a force on the wing with no opposite force.gtThe assertion that the air must arrive simultaneously at the trailing edge is sometimes referred to as the Equal TransitTime Fallacy.     gtInteresting Lift force | Chairlift | Canard aeronautics | Pair skating | Lifting body Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckuqnee oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckuqnee.

6402870,0,t1_czh9669,Megafauna didnt necessarily all go extinct at the same time. Mammoths existed on Wrangel island into the sixteenth century until humans arrived. Megafauna in New Zealand and Madagascar didnt die out until about  years ago and corresponded directly with human arrival. This happened even with only moderate hunting pressure with the largest animals going first then the smaller ones. No endemic animals above kg exist in Madagascar anymore for instance when there was once a diverse assemblage of large lemurs crocodiles hippos and Bibymalagasy a unique mammal phyla.As for the Americas it has been suggested that mammoth extinction changed the landscape to such an extent it caused climate change. This is still debated however but it is a possibility that could implicate humans even in places where they had yet to arrive.Im not suggesting that natural climate change didnt occur or have an effect but its hard to doubt that humans arent capable of causing an extinction on a global scale even during early periods of their spread. It is of course still up for debate and any other global changes certainly contributed but human spread certainly increased the pressure on large animals beyond the point of recovery or vice versa depending on whose work you read or who you speak to.So it is not just hunting that caused the event but hunting other already occurring natural phenomenon and indirect phenomenon caused by human spread.,badscience,czhfwic,3,t5_2qph7

6705869,0,t1_d0cwj7z,ok fair enough. Looking to a university familiar to me  they grant an honorary doctorate in the sciences only for distinguished acheivement which they define as that which is widely recognized by peers in the field of endevour and the publicSimon Fraser University awards a docorate of science for outstanding achievement in science engineering computing medicine. They specifically mention his role as an educator and as president of the planetary society in their blurb.He also holds degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute which can nominate someone for being an  or educator in science. Also Johns Hopkins University awarded him a doctorate of humane letters and I couldnt find their criteria. They have actually awarded doctorates of science though so its notable thats not what they gave him.Wikipedia claims that Willamette university gave him an honorary doctorate of science but he is not listed on their Anyway Ive put way too much time into this now but from what I can see I would argue that an honorary doctorate of science probably does imply some kind of scientific knowledge  but its not clear that it requires that it be a special knowledge of science if you do great works in the community. You could have an average persons understanding of science according to Rensselaer. Id argue the University of Manitoba might give him one for being widely recognized as an excellent science educator and I think thats exactly what SFU did in fact do.So I think youre right that it does imply a knowledge of science after all  but it doesnt require any special knowledge of science so it doesnt mean that you have to be good at it.I think the thing I learned from this is that honorary degrees are not just political but their requirements vary so much from university to university that you cant take them at face value.,badscience,d0cy0tl,1,t5_2qph7

9277145,0,t3_57hb65,This hardly needs a debunking comment  the speaker claims that Newtons insights on gravity are not valid as it depends on colonial modernity to be accepted. But Im happy to direct readers to Steve Novellas write up if they want a more thoughtful and developed response.,badscience,d8ry0ki,6,t5_2qph7

10857359,0,t1_ddztvkc,gt Without going there Im guessing UBI is basically their response to any criticism of their ideas?Its more that they really overdo the case for basic income and make some rather bad arguments in favour of it. I think that basic income is a good idea but not because I think it will cause a reduction in illegal immigration or because I think automation will cause  unemployment or because itll reduce governments administrative costs.,badscience,ddzuywm,5,t5_2qph7

11275892,0,t3_60wyfo,The reproduced point is probably the most important one to me. Often theres a study that shows some effect but its the only study that does show that effect. Or other studies show a much weaker effect.Honestly it should be the science writers job to evaluate this stuff before writing sensationalist articles. ,badscience,dfa3tri,14,t5_2qph7
