We wanted to pick something from the good old Toonami Days since I know from watching the gaming channel that at least some of the TFS peeps havent watched a lot of newer anime.What I didnt know until the podcast came out which was the day after I finished the script was that Outlaw Star is Takas favorite anime.So yeah please excuse me while I rock back and forth in a corner crying.,tfstiba,d4vv34m,1,t5_3eurx
