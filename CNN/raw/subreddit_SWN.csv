7478987,0,t3_4hptuk,Reasonable limitations.  I would suggest taking the prosthetic limb and then adding to it the cost of these items. lowlight   binoculars   credits.So at least  credits on Polychrome. Or  if using core book pricing.  Multiply by x if trying to reduce the system strain by .,SWN,d2sbgir,1,t5_34j2j
7611572,0,t3_4hs75d,The Sheet in Roll is well made. Its not quite as intuitive as some of the other games but it gets the job done pretty well. I approve. ,SWN,d37e9mx,2,t5_34j2j

10423959,0,t3_5pab92,Maybe the ship went through an experimental oneway jump gate that can send a ship to any star system without the need to have a gate already built at the destination which would vastly increase the speed of colonization. It looked like the test was a catastrophic failure so the project was abandoned and the ship presumed lost.,SWN,dcpmi4b,2,t5_34j2j

10810581,0,t1_dduycuy,gt How often in real life do you think a mugger walks down the street looks at someone and goes Yea I know exactly how difficult it will be to beat that guy up? Cause I can tell you that theres no shortage of articles of robbers accidentally messing with black belts or retired military personnel and not getting away easily. How often in real life have you sat down and said to yourself Okay this little essaywork orderthing I have to do is going to take like half an hour tops and then found yourself in that same seat  hours later only halfway done?Thats what the dice roll is for we determind how hard it ish then the roll determines if we were dead wrong or mabye we overestimated it. That is the primary point of the RNG in RPGs that use Dice you might know hes AC but if the dice wont ever let you get over  you wont hit him anyway. Its needlessly withholding informationgt Now imagine instead that your GM just told you that this creatures AC was . Oh. So basically easier to hit than even the slowest unarmored human. Guess that choice isnt as interesting any more. You fire again and its dead. Well time to move on from that boring scene.On the other side maybe he told you its AC . So youre getting the hell out of there. No questions asked no other real choices. Just fucking get out of here.Is it bad the player can make Player decisions based on mechanical information? We should always remember its a RPG G is for the Game part. And id feel super iffied if a game never told me how to use X item on Y thing to do Z. Lets embrace the Game part as much as we embrace the RP part.gt Im not saying that you should never reveal AC most of the time you should and you will. Ganger McGangerson with the busted semiauto pistol isnt going to surprise anyone with his psychic kungfu. Same goes for DC a decent engineer will know roughly how long itll take and how difficult it will be to juryrig your gravcar engine into working again hes familiar with the tech and hes got tools on hand.Cool we basicly agree.gt And this goes for players as well you can pretty accurately guess the DC of most actions you will undertake. So on and so forth. But SWN is to a great extent a game about exploration.I mean it can be its a sandbox game. So the theme of the game is decided mostly by the players aka if they dont give a flying spagehetti string for exploarition and are way more intersted in setting up a merc company and running the logistics for that. Well then youve got a game centered around beeing Mercs.And that is not to say you cant have other themes in a game but in a sandbox game the players primarly decide what kinda game they want to play by their actions not the plotgt If youre playing Shadowrun no one expects the GM to just give you a map of all the security guards routines where the cameras are how to disable them etc. Thats what Recon is all about.I think youve misunderstood me at one point or another. I could care less what the characters know their meant to be in the unknown. Im only talking about this from the players sidegt Whats the point of even playing if you just pick your battles so you always know you can win statistically? The unknown is again really just another element of the game.exactly for the characteres. Players who want to win at the thing they are doing will do everything in their power to minimize the risk of failure and they should be well within their right to make something just not failable if they prepared enough. But that can severly drag the game down which is why i love blades in the Darkgt Its something you deal with not something you yawn at and go Yea whatever can we skip this part and get to the shooties?I agree like  there i agree RNG should be a big influencer. But you also dont want to RP out the sceen where you go buy your suit unless the gm has something nasty in store for the character. The things the players arnt intersting in shouldnt have any focus they can make nice background pieces but probly never really more than thatgt Yes withholding information can blind players. If their characters are blind they are blind. Thats how roleplaying works.Heh i so disagree with that thinking But then wer goin heavly into how we each play. I think its importent to not forget that it is a game but i also think this comes down to the simple point of Meta gaming and the perceived notion that it is Satan himself which it isnt. Now im not talking about blatant Meta abuse but the kind that exist in every game no matter how hard some people try to stamp it outgt If they dont want to be blind make them work for it. If you want everything handed to you go play a Telltale game or Apocalypse World or something.I must really have made you misunderstand me at some point or another. As we both seem to get at the same thing just with diffrent words. I too think that if your character does not know something the player dosnt know it either. But it sucks when you think  thing and the GM thinks another so i think its better to have more transparency than less between players and Game masters,SWN,ddv19pi,2,t5_34j2j
11193467,0,t1_df0kyjf,Generally speaking Ill have them level up end of session   so maybe  hours of actual gameplay. Ill artificially fudge some extra xp where necessary for little incharacter role playing just to encourage it early in the campaign ,SWN,df0rlf6,1,t5_34j2j
11493282,0,t3_63ss2z,I had a very enjoyable swn game on rpol a few years back and a couple more where the gm flaked on me. Characters flaked out of the successful game at around  anyway though.,SWN,dfyrgl6,1,t5_34j2j
