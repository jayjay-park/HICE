475741,0,t3_1zk1ws,Lose your first  games fast. Thats the best advice for any beginner. Dont worry about theory or problems or learning.The reasoning is that in chess you can learn how the pieces move. But in go you must gain experience to learn how the stones move. Theres no shortcut or book that will help this along faster than just playing go at a quick pace lt sec per move.EDIT I see daegs has a similar idea. To add to his Id say play  games only x then move on to x. The patterns in x that lead to capturing stones will be easier to recognize than the x sequences that leave you with  weak groups but not losing until one of them somehow gets killed  moves later.,baduk,cfucet5,1,t5_2qhqe

556752,1,t1_cg3d61c,At the time when I came to reddit there was no reply by you. It actually took me quite a while to finish writing the reply because in the meantime I spoke to Younggil on the phone twice about some orders and other things called another customer and sent quite a few emails as a result.At this stage I dont really care if you came back somewhere in between and posted something to be honest. When I wrote that it was true and Im not going to apologize over this sort of petty technicality because I already apologized to you about a mistake earlier and you seemed to take that as a license to plough on with further insults.Perhaps to you calling people a liar saying theyre disingenuous and so on is normal. But to me its actually insulting. It actually hurts. It makes me feel so bad that I feel distracted and unfocused afterwards. Thats why I took the day off from reddit. Maybe thats what the people who write such things want. They can win an argument without any actual substance. I havent had weekends since starting Go Game Guru and this weekend I have a lot of catching up to do so I need to stay focused. I came back just now to see if you finally replied against my better judgment.I didnt expect a long reply from you. I understand that you have a life. I just expected a simple acknowledgement that yes the concentration can actually be calculated and no I didnt lie about the numbers or mislead people after all. Even if you wrote something else in the meantime you werent willing to admit that. And whats with having to bold those words anyway?Perhaps Im wrong but Im starting to get the sense that you might be the kind of person who cant admit when they make mistakes. It takes much more to admit mistakes and apologize than it does to just go full bore at someone over the internet. The fact is that you didnt have a good understanding of the materials and the science and you were apparently confused about some arithmetic too. It might make you feel bad when I write that but at least I havent laced it with nonfactual insults that dont add anything to the discussion except to make the real person on the other end of the screen feel worse.Go back and read what you wrote. Do you honestly think that everything you wrote still stands and that none of it was unnecessarily hurtful? If thats what you think then theres no point continuing to talk to you because all you care about is winning regardless of whether or not youre right.,baduk,cg3k531,1,t5_2qhqe

728129,0,t3_22gwv9,Ive never requested an undo except after the rare misclick and even then I often just let it go. I set my mobile device on confirmation mode but my PC mouse has been known to have a mind of its own! I always grant undos unless Ive already made my next play. But then again Ive never come up against opponents that pester me with undo requests as in your experience. Im not sure what Id do in that case.I dont want to second guess if its a misclick or a bad play. Sure some are obvious misclicks but how would you know it wasnt? Many bad plays are just one intersection away from a good play so how would you know it wasnt a misclick? Also sometimes I hover my mouse over a dubious play studying it and the mouse accidentally clicks on that spot. Im sure that looks like I just made a bad play to my opponent but its actually a misclick.

1322276,0,t3_297bqt,Its only matter of time. Even without algorithmic advancements computers have Moores law on their side while we humans cant really get that much better at go. When it comes down to it go is all about reading  strategy is a heuristic we came up with however the problem with heuristics is that they can give nonoptimal results. Computers do not have this problem and Im extremely curious to see how strong go engines will play when they get stronger than top humans.In chess computers often play moves that look completely nonsensical and willingly enter positions that are considered unplayable. I was a big fan of chess as computers were starting to become stronger than humans and it was quite an eye opener see how incorrect all our ideas about strategy were. As I said its only a matter of time until this happens in go too. People say that go is too computationally complex for that but you dont need to actually solve the game you just need to get better than humans. If you compare how chess engines play compared to known perfect play from calculated endgame table bases youll find out that engines actually suck quite badly often making game deciding mistakes.,baduk,ciidfr1,7,t5_2qhqe

You learn best when working on problems that are just difficult enough to require thought and effort but not so difficult that failure is very likely. If youre finding yourself stuck and frustrated more than occasionally youre doing problems that are too hard and youd benefit far more from drilling simpler problems to reinforce the basics.Also Tsumego are not about learning to recognize shapes or develop good instincts. This is a very common misconception. Tsumego are about refining your reading technique learning how to read efficiently and quickly and without getting stuck. Looking at answers teaches you nothing about how to find answers and only makes you a marginally better go player.If you find yourself stuck on problems more than occasionally find easier problems to do.

3038744,0,t3_2uwkav,Hi. I transitioned from Chess to Go as well. Im currently k on kgs.I dont mean any offense at all but k doesnt really exist. The k mark is supposed to mean you understand the basics of the game. Id avoid referring to any rank lower than k especially about yourself P.My advice will probably heavily differ from other peoples so take it with a grain of salt. First just try to get a solid understanding of the rules. If you want to read them or watch videos that doesnt really matter. Once you have a basic understanding if you are willing to spend money get a tutor right away and then simply follow their advice. If money is of concern start by playing games verse computers. I advise playing against computers for several reasons. The most important is being able to undo moves. Being able to undo makes it easier to test things and find out where you went wrong. The second big reason is that you can set the difficulty.Once you feel more confident in your understanding of the game where you would estimate yourself k learn  or  joseki and then simply play a bunch of games against actual opponents online. Dont worry if you win or lose matches just keep playing. Once youve played a lot of games then you should actually start studying. Guides for very low rank players k are mindnumbingly boring and repetitive. Guides for ranks higher than your own will seem abstract. They will ignore things that should be obviously wrong for players that are their intended rank but will leave lower rank players feeling like everything is very abstract.TL DRMy advice is to play against computers till you are k. Make use of the undo button. Then play a bunch of games against human opponents. A whole bunch. Once youve done all that then begin to study. ,baduk,cocyqdu,1,t5_2qhqe

5176937,0,t1_cv9o9v9,B QIf white plays P to stay connected youll play N to keep your connection with your upper stones better and to threaten cuts. M for B is not good because N and N arent good exchanges.If white pushes with O black hane N. If white hane N. Then it becomes difficult for black... If black plays Q white O and black is now gonna struggle with bad shape and if black doesnt prolong the fight it looks as if black got nothing. But if white plays anything other than O or P black will then play O and threaten to enclose and kill white. If black gains wall and white has to live in gote black now has enough strength to attack other places on the board.Black directly O instead of Q is also questionable. White could sacrifice the stones and gain outside influence instead or even gain sente. It may be enough if black can do some good attacks at whites side but it could be difficult although White has mostly high stones so it could be difficult to kill thingsmake things live small in there... But white could also get a large center.That is an example how itd play out. In this case O doesnt seem like the best move... Its difficult to find a good move there O seems like it doesnt threaten enough. The goal with this fight is either to gain a lot of points or to partially or completely enclose white while letting white live in gote. That is to gain a wall influence so that you can start attacking whites side.EditgtIf white pushes with O black hane N. If white hane N. Then it becomes difficult for black...N for black may be possible. If white nobi M. Black cut O. White Atari N. Black escapes M. White pushes M. Black Q.

Each extra move in the form of handi stones you get is  more points.This is more easily understood if you consider what a rank means.

Remember Fan Hui is a relatively inactive pro compared to Lee Sedol and the pros have had a chance to look at this game to understand what is going on.

Why? Because it does nothing to help you. Its a completely counterproductive way of playing the game. There are people who will always play the game to the end which is completely allowed. There are no rules against it. If you meet a player who does this then it will make you angry and make you more likely to play a dumb move. In such a case you deserve to lose becuase you were not able to keep calm. I have lost this way many times but that is my fault not my opponents. I am the one playing the moves after all and if finishing a game was so trivial then this wouldnt be such an issue.I understand the utalitarian reason for resigning early. Its still a waste of your emotional energy to hold onto rules which were designed for playing in person instead of over the internet.Instead I try my best to stabilize the game. Ill capture dead stones even when not prompted to and ill make sure to solidify myself to simplify the game. After a while opponents begin to resign out of sheer discouragment. If not then I get to see the white wins by  pts at the end which is also very satisfying.Emotional mastery is paramount in go.

It only goes off of what it already knows. In reality of course the solution isnt complete yet. But AI doesnt know that and it doesnt care. The power it is using while playing these show matches has nothing to do with the computational power it needs to learn. The scale is absolutely irrelevant. Go is the game that can and will be solved. Its not a question of if its only a question of when. We already know that AlphaGo is learning at an extremely fast rate. It is already at a level of the best human players. Will it take a year or two to completely solve the game? Maybe or maybe not. But the solution will come sooner or later.

This is how they did it for . and is common practice besides.The only uncertainty here is how many elo points they needed to get. Their estimate depends on ratings of Fan Hui and in particular the  losses in the unofficial games. And also on ranks of other go programs on KGS and them   handicap stones though if you look at the graph there is something strange with these handicaps looks to me like those  stones gave  ranks from dan KGS to dan KGS. Now they did something odd with handicaps  value network cant play nonkomi games as its evaluation was all trained w komi so they gave them an extra stone instead of removing komi if I understood that part of the paper right.

A best of  series does not really give you that much time to experiment considering probing for weaknesses almost by definition means that you think are inferior to the move you would normally play.But I guess if he has decided after game  that the computer really is substantially stronger than him at a normal game I cant fault him entirely for trying one last ditch effort.Though he may always regret if he never gave his normal game a chance to play.,baduk,d0wphgz,9,t5_2qhqe
6885083,0,t1_d0wp33b,gt if you ask me the biggest concern is that the technology behind AlphaGo could be used to make a wide variety of human jobs obsolete  but thats a thread in and of itselfThats my ultimate hope actually. Its inevitable that humans are a soon to be obsolete piece of hardware for most applications at least  they dont change while technology furiously advances. The only question is exactly how soon. In principle this process makes the industrial base more productive ie cheaper enriching society. Now if we cant enjoy the fruits of having to work less to produce the material goods that make our civilization tick clearly the societal order of today is just perverse.gt  But AlphaGo played so well in game  that for me Lee Sedol became the underdog. In addition I prefer close matches rather than onesided curbstomps.I agree. A  score would be more exciting. And while them being at top pro level is incredibly exciting it already being a superhuman player with no chink in its armor at all is a bit anticlimactic. ,baduk,d0wqogy,6,t5_2qhqe

6892421,0,t1_d0xitk4,gtAlphago may be a dedicated machine but the point is to apply what deepind has created to other fields. There is so much that this sort of software can achieve. It does not end here.No argument there!  gtthere is something to be said for a computer that is able to handle vast amounts of data which our brains can even hold onto very well. Millions of years of evolution have left us with a brain which is easily vulnerable to bias jumps to conclusions cannot handle large amounts of information gets tired is influenced by emotion and has an imperfect memory. Our brains may be great but they are also heavily flawed.Its all true.  No system is without blind spots and weaknesses though too  and computers are no exception to this.  You might rephrase my argument more as Computers are still leaps and bounds more flawed than humans are holistically and that is not likely to change in any short period of time.  You say that humans cant handle large amounts of information but I think we can handle far more than AlphaGo can  and the vast majority of it is information that is more diverse and robustly applicable compared to the information that AlphaGo can process.gtWatson the machine that beat the world champ at Jeopardy!  was adapted to work in medicine it was able to do find many diagnoses for cancers which are difficult for humans to discern. Even with things that take more feeling such as go computers are getting better.Watson was created by humans to beat the world champ at Jeopardy! and was adapted by humans to work in medicine and use humandesigned algorithms to find diagnoses for cancers. None of that is from Watsons own ingenuity.gtLook your points are trying to say that somehow our brains are superior. If its true today which im not convinced that it is it will not always be this way.I dont know how you can argue that our brains are inferior.  We built AlphaGo and everything AlphaGo can do we too can do  it can just do it faster because unlike us it was designed again by us to do this one specific thing faster.  We shaped it and taught it how to play the game it was we who trained it and imbued it with the knowledge and experience of many tens of thousands of human players.  It reads the way we told it to read and measures success the way we told it to measure success.  It didnt drag itself up out of the mud and somehow become crowned king of Go we raised it up and crafted it to suit the specific purpose of being king of Go  to see accurately into one of the blind spots of the human brain where we ourselves fatigue and falter most.  And thats really what the headline should be here our brains may indeed be flawed but they are robust enough that we can identify our flaws and construct the means by which to fix those flaws.  To defeat bias and jumping to conclusions we have invented logic and the scientific method.  To handle large amounts of information without getting tired or being influenced by emotion we have invented computers.  The successes of these creations ultimately comes from us  we are the ones who have agency and the ones who have earned whatever praise or glory there is to be had.  AlphaGos victory is our victory more than anything else we beat the best of ourselves today quite literally surpassing the limits of our own flaws.

6900273,0,t3_4a7wl2,Haha did you read or write this article?gt Some educated guessesgt We cant yet know for sure what went wrong but we can make some guesses.Weve seen these kinds of moves before played by other Go AIs. They seem to be a common failure pattern of AIs which rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search to choose moves.  gt AlphaGo is greatly superior to that previous generation of AIs but it still relies on Monte Carlo for some aspects of its analysis.  gt My theory is that when theres an excellent move like White  which just barely works it becomes easier for the computer to overlook it.  gt This is because sometimes theres only one precise move order which makes a tesuji work and all other variations fail.  gt Unless every line of play is considered it becomes more likely that the computer and humans for that matter will overlook it.  gt This means that approximation techniques used by the computer which work really well most of the time will see many variations that lead to a win missing the needle in the haystack that leads to a near certain loss.  ,baduk,d0ygqe5,3,t5_2qhqe
6907898,0,t1_d0z9fy3,Right.gtAlphaGo did not respond correctly to that one move I think with the first stone it placed after Lees move. Possibly because it still didnt calculate the value of that move correctly.I dont think AlphaGO calculates any value for a move after its played. In that sense it cannot make the mistake of disregarding a move it will just calculate newadditional trees starting from the current board position.I can imagine it can be surprised by a move if the policy network didnt give a high value to a move and it is played anyways. Now AG needs to calculate many new trees starting from a move it didnt have much data for in the first place. I assume here that AG uses previously calculated trees as a startingpoint for a new tree search.If AG only realized its mistake after  moves AG didnt explore this specific tree deeply enough otherwise it would have realized this error before. ,baduk,d0zbvqk,5,t5_2qhqe

6927449,0,t3_4a89nl,I really like lessons in the fundamentals of go but for me it was more entertainment than lesson material.I can really recommend the whole elementary go series apart from the th book but that is hard to get anyhow though the books are very different tesuji and life and death are more problem books than anything while attack and defense and in the beginning give a nice overview what the phases of the game are about endgame is something in between. The joseki book is a nice overview for ideas especcially since the joseki are simple ones but I think following joseki by memorisation hurts your game more than it helps also it is way easier to look something up in eidogo or brugo.I personally also like direction of play but that is something for later reading and I know other people who dislike it. Gernerally I recommend chosing the elementary series book for the part of your game you are dissatisfied with and read those first also you probably should be dissatisfied with your endgame  almost everyone should be more but that one is quite a chore.

But when you look at the board over time white is able to cast a wider net over the board and impact more space.

6959198,0,t3_4b0nvg,I am a k so take my comments with a grain of salt. Also reading my comments they sound harsh. I dont mean it that way and I really hope these help you.You responded perfectly well  you have a big advantage after the first few moves. One thing is to try to avoid complicated fights so you can keep your territory advantage and nullify their influence advantage.Completing your top left corner is a big move that you didnt play until very late on. is bad it leaves open the cut which you do notice in the next move good job.  is bad it is an empty triangle and doesnt get you anything. the main use of empty triangles are when you absolutely need them to escape certain situations  would be okay if it worked. In this sort of situation all they do is reduce your libertiesThe sequence of moves starting at move  including the cut are not good because youre starting a fight that has little potential to help you in an area completely surrounded by black stones.You should not have tried to save your two stones for the same reason. Take the top side which is wide open or complete your top left corner. is not needed.  should be D if you want to deal with the lower left. Two individual stones touching is urgent  theres a big difference between what happens depending on who moves there first. The top is also still wide open.   is an endgame move not something to be played when there is a  by  square with no stones in it.  is bad  you shouldnt start a fight when black has a group in the center as strong as they do.  is unnecessary  the stones are dead  L would be great shape.  is also not needed.Youre right about move   that would kill it. You still have a chance at  though. is not needed  is super not needed.  is a big endgame move you didnt play until late lookup monkey jump if you want to see how big it is I see you already see how  is bad  good job noticing it.  is a useless move on blacks part  C captures the two stones and avoids any danger at all.Big picture is this you get a huge advantage by blacks opening. You then let black be a super strong group in the middle by spending lots of moves trying to save two stones which end up dead. Black doesnt manage to draw you into a big enough fight or take enough of your territory so you win.,baduk,d155rh8,2,t5_2qhqe

7167812,0,t3_4dmddl,Just to add something to all the other answers given already ...Making a ko even an unfavorable one in a situation where you would otherwise be dead outright is already a huge victory regardless of whether you win or lose the ko.  If you win sweet the payoff is obvious.  If you lose you get some compensation elsewhere thereby massively decreasing how much you would otherwise be fated to lose.  Significantly reducing the size of your losses is a victory unto itself.They say every single move played is a mistake whoever makes the smallest mistakes wins the game and whoever they are they are absolutely right.  Go is as much a game of endurance as it is a game of making territory and capturing stones.Hope that helps!,baduk,d1swuvt,3,t5_2qhqe

Its kind of like a go club that changes hosts from day to day.  A lot of them know each other and are delighted to meet someone new.  ampnbsp  That said I have a few recommendations for you or anyone wanting to stream.  ampnbsp        Consistency  try to start at the same time to take some of the guess work out of when youre around.  This is the single biggest factor to build an audience.  Even if youre completely terrible and im not implying you are people will tune in because youre reliable for when the wish to watch something.        Always be aware of your chat Ive seen a lot of new streamers turn a blind eye to their chat thinking theyll interact more when the views rise but people leave because there is no interaction and thus theres a problem.  ampnbsp  It took xhu and I a long time to build our viewers on twitch but it can be done.

It will have a tutorial basic AI online blitz style quickplay x maybe some other sizes still playing and play with friends. Idea is simple beginner friendly clean. Not the type of thing a serious player would use for their matches but the type of thing that is very user friendly and attracts new players. Just fun.I am working hard on it nonstop. I havent posted recently as I really just have a giant list of items to work through and there arent any big changes etc to mention. I am happy to answer any questions though probably a lot are covered in the threads above.I have most of the basic local and server functionality as well as Steam integrations working trying to reduce the bugs etc. The polish is pretty unchanged from the greenlight video right now. I am trying to get to a good point for early access in the very near future. It is a balancing act though. Probably I will leave some of the server side stuff as unfinished as I am sure I will have lots of work to do once they are under load anyway. The polish stuff I would love to leave for in early access but worry that might be a really bad idea. Anyway I am here!,baduk,d4no4pc,7,t5_2qhqe

Even if we assume that the players play two straight lines down the middle the simplest game possible pretty much then one guy hanes on the nd line. Should the other guy block the hane or counterhane on the other side? If he doesnt block the hane how many points will he lose? How many points can he gain by counterhaneing?Its extremely difficult and far more advanced than what beginners can and should learn about.

9511151,0,t1_d9ko8p7,I think theres a flaw in your thinking here that uleoneuler pointed at. Namely that in order to understand fuseki  its not completely necessary to understand why  are wrong. I mean if your hypothesis were true then scientific progress would be much slower than it is. And perhaps wouldnt have the exponential growth that we see today. Instead of being weighed down by all past hypotheses we just learn those which are important and relevant to our understanding. So maybe youd only need to learn  and . So in reality the learning experience can be made more efficient.The best part about AG is that its capable of creating whole new tactics independent of what our poverbs say. Just having something which challenges our understanding of the game is hugely beneficial. This is why people have proposed using AIs weaker than AG for learning. See CS see leela When AG does become commercial people are going to want to get their hands on it to train ASAP. I hope that demand isnt too high so that I can buy it cheaply!Furthermore the reason why its difficult to figure out if AGs fuseki are any good is because we need to figure out the ideas behind them. This isnt impossible we just need a decent sample size and example games for pros to figure this out. What does AG plan to do against x y z moves? For this we would require a number of games which were played between itself or otherwise. Next after understanding the principles we need to evaluate if theyre any good. This would require more playing and testing the ideas.As you can see theres a lot of experimentation to be done here. Its not that AG is beyond our understanding. We just need much more information than we currently have. As I said before AG might already be much stronger than us but again we cant know that without more data. Saying anything else is jumping to conclusions a little.AG shows great ability to read ahead and play very deep moves that much is clear. Its nothing short of amazing comparing it to other AIs. Is it such that we cant learn from them absolutely not we just need more information.,baduk,d9lg99p,3,t5_2qhqe

Even when your opponent was repetedly making mistakes giving you more and more opportunities to kill you missed all of them.Killing the invasion in the late game should have been especially easy. Black trying to live here should be laughable.You have a good sense of direction and you try to get profit from attacking instead of trying to kill at all cost. You also take care about connections. All of that is very good for k. But at some point you need to be able to read a bit in order to progress. So just do tsumego.

Theres no a priori reason to believe thats possible even in theory. After all AlphaGo can probably reach over  positions. Even if the vast majority of these are trivial since they represent essentially random moves by the opponent where many replies win and you can chose the one that is easiest to compress you would need a compression factor of about  to get a reasonable sized program of a few yottabytes.,baduk,dbverkx,3,t5_2qhqe

10210536,0,t3_5m73po,Good questionLet me draw on my experience and the experience of the many exbeginners I interacted with over  years.  Proverb  Lose your first  games as fast as possibleA lot of people at one point start reading go theories and play less. The best way to learn theories is by experimenting with it.  Proverb  When youll be dan people will not check how you played at kDont fear playing interesting moves because you think its bad. Dont rage because someone played obviously bad moves and you still lost to it. Everything is a learning experience and stepping stone for your future dan rank.  Proverb  Your rank is not who you areDont put too much ego in the ranking you get. The first thing you learn with go is probably humility you will lose half your games and second is probably patience.  Proverb  Put yourself in your opponent shoesIf you were your own opponent how would you respond to your own move ? Stronger people dont hope that their opponents will fall to a trap they play a move that is strong regardless of what the opponents answer  Proverb  Review your gamesOnce youre about k try to review your games after playing test variations what could happen even better if you can get your opponent to participate.Before k ask people to help you review because You know nothing Jon Snow  Proverb  Dont underestimate xYou might be tempted to jump to x ASAP. I suggest you to play x a lot until you can always keep a living group with  stone handicap even against dan players. All in all all the preparation in x joseki fuseki chuban ... are preparation for territory contest which culminates in fights.You can win without fighting later but at beginner level fights are inevitable x help you get strong with that in a very fast manner you can play half a dozen fights in x in the same play time as a x game.More importantly its easier to understand why you lost in x than in x.  Proverb  Exercise your mind you shallHow humans learn ? By repetition and imitation in a short timeframe.Issue ? from one game to another you probably wont see the same patterns.Solution ? Set of exercises on those particular patterns. Check goproblems.com I suggest you start with tesuji how to skillfully connectdisconnect stones and lifeanddeath how to live or kill  Proverb  Have funIts easier to do something if youre happy to do itNow if at one point you like to learn through physical book and not only online I suggest you pick Tesuji by James Davies and Opening Theory Made Easy by Otake Hideo as your first book that was what I started withIf you like to read online  goproblems.com and Senseis library would be your treasure trove.Welcome to the go community !,baduk,dc1f6tr,28,t5_2qhqe

10668041,0,t1_ddg9cg5,Generally speaking a weak group is one that you have to defend. Weak groups are targets  they give your opponent something that they can attack for free. So stones that you sacrifice arent weak and groups that are unconditionally alive without further play arent weak. You have to alter your strategy to work around weak groups. If you find yourself saying Well Id love to make this move or that move but I cant because then that group might get cut off then that group is weak.The fuzzy middle comes in with groups that have great thickness but havent yet made unconditional life. They may be strong early in the game when their prospects for life are still wide open but future play can alter that. For a great example of that kind of shape consider the ponnuki. Early in the game a ponnuki is incredibly strong. However if you somehow allow a ponnuki to be completely surrounded its dead.,baduk,ddgbsse,3,t5_2qhqe

If the ladder favors black this result is basically unthinkable for white regardless of who gets the corner.  But even if white has the ladder black can play a ladderbreaker or dance underneath whites stones while white captures the cutting stone so the only thing white gets is a gote ponnuki which could be valuable depending on the position but is unlikely to be as valuable as blacks position plus sente.  Either way white gets the short end of the stick.Also since black ends sente if he wants the corner he can clamp whites R stone or simply play in the corner himself to completely secure it.

11375372,0,t1_dfl9128,gt hire someonegtbelieve it or not i did toy with that idea  but there are so many buts... software engineering is wellnamed it really is an engineering profession which requires lots of training to do well and i fear i would be an impossibly demanding customer to boot having taught user interfaces for decades and developed some strong opinions about them. theres no money in it for me it would be an expensive vanity rather than a commercial opportunity so i would rather leave whatever i have left to the Missionaries of Charity as already planned.but open source  yes thats the way to go  just look at how wonderful Linux is compared to MS. gtgtwouldnt be implementablewhy do you think that?  can you give me an example of something in my paper that you cannot imagine becoming code?or are you thinking of one of the other papers mentioned in the video?your answer will help me to find out what i will need to explain more carefully in my next video if there ever is one for right now i am more interested in making a videos that will explain what maths is all about in a way all kids call understand and enjoy  just about the opposite of the way its taught in school and all the mathophileproduced vids about maths on YouTube including Khan Academy.  ive looked and looked there are lots of ones that are great for people who already like maths but none for those that dont.with one exception  my own naturally enough!  which i made after seeing the most awful Common Core way young children are taught sums these days.  that led to a few other videos but theyre a bit ragged and disjointed and not all are suited to under s so i feel like working on that for a bit  because until Joe Public becomes numerate the shysters will continue to get away with their nefarious tricks.Heres an example suppose a banker is paid  million a year how many years will it take him to amass a wealth of  billion?,baduk,dfldnob,-1,t5_2qhqe

11529551,0,t1_dg2ratb,I agree that the search tree is cut and rebuilt mostly expanded the uncut branches almost every move.And I agree that it would completly change the game.  That is the point.I want to see a game where alphago has do deal with something that could never come up in normal play.  Something that could potentially cause it to lose.It could be that alphago freaks out like in game .  Which shows where the limit is.Or we learn some very new creative moves and that deep mind did a very good job training the AI to handle even impossible situations.,baduk,dg2vkf4,1,t5_2qhqe

11677308,0,t3_66mevb,I think a good part of it is the language barrier... the online Go community is relatively small so you dont often get separate servers for different languages.That said Go also has no luck factor... if you lose a large group its because you made a huge mistake.  Therefor it is less likely that someone will be angry at you for winning.Also since its v rengo not withstanding although that isnt taken seriously no one is going to be relying on you and therefor get angry at your mistakes.,baduk,dgjn0yi,12,t5_2qhqe
