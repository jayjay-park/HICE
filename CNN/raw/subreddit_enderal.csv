Are you a cynic thus believing that humanity is doomed either way or an optimist that believes there is hope?TBF they DID say there were major releases coming up by the end of this year to expand the game so maybe something to elaborate on the ending?

9115887,0,t1_d87h6i0,For one Biowares ability to write three dimensional flawed characters blows the flat crap most games put in out of the water. They do take a lot of tropes but they improve upon them or even satirize them. Then theres the way they handle acceptance and real world issues in a fantasy setting to the point where its recognizeable but fits with the lore theyve established to create a point without making it a shove in your face. The characters coming back from the dead can mostly be blamed on some of the bad writers on the team such as Kirby and the Jennifer Helper who completely altered Anders personality and is by far the weakest writer in Biowares employ. As Ive said they arent up there with novels but when it comes to games they craft better stories than almost anyone out there right now. As for silly Power fantasies well its a video game thats part of the allure of a game in that particular genre. I cant think of a single RP that ISNT a power fantasy of some sort. At least they arent silly misogynistic power fantasies like the Witcher series in which every female exists only for an extremely distasteful sex scene with your somehow swoonworthy hero. Ive found some aspects of their games predictable but not many to be honest. Maybe youve played more games than I have but I tend to enjoy the stories they craft. I do find the utter lack of good story driven RPGs to be awful right now. It seems like youre pretty much SOL if youre not a hackslash fanboy or a weeb Aka Final Fantasy fangirl. Players who actually want a good story are pretty much left with Bioware mods and the occasional odd drop that no one talks about KOA was pretty good imo but it failed horribly in the financial department. I love Bioware games because to me they combine the right amount of deep storytelling player choice good characters workable gameplay minimal bugs and decent looking graphics. I dont have to want on any of those fronts even if theyre not the best in any of them either. I know if I buy a Bioware game that Im going to be engaged its gonna look good and Ill be able to have some choice and craft the character I want to play rather than watching someone elses story unfold and just getting to do the fight scenes. ,enderal,d87kys2,2,t5_2xcc6

9146262,0,t1_d8axnse,Im sorry youre taking it like that Im not a hater at all.I loved Bethesda really. Actually I still love Morrowind and I consider it one of my favorite games ever. I gave a try even to Arena and Daggerfall when Bethesda released them as a free legal download for the th and the th anniversaries of The Elder Scrolls series. I find also very interesting the TESLore and I remember when I used the TESCS to export all the books for reading them out of the game and when I tried a mod like The Great House Dagoth to experiment a different progression of the main quest and to put myself in Dagoth Urs shoes  .At present Im very much interested in Tamriel Rebuilt  development with regard particularly to the lore continuity. With their last release the modders managed to achieve a seamless integration of the city of Mournhold Tribunal with Almalexia I think you should give it a try if you want to watch a world taking shape around VVanderfell with the best accuracy go visit the Ruins of KemelZe for example while reading the book of the same name.But relying on my personal experience I never found the same character and story complexity and ambiguity in Morrowind sequels so I started thinking that Bethesda took some core decisions according to different motivations than the TES Vision.Here we are in the Enderal subreddit so I apologise for this very long OT I only whish Bethesda could give priority to their vision again instead of following the mainstream logic.,enderal,d8bcrzp,5,t5_2xcc6

9365337,0,t3_58t87e,Trails of the Past isnt part of the main quest line so its hard to answer that question without knowing where you in in the main quest.  If you meant to write Fragments of the Past then you are a little more than  of the way through the main quest and yes now would be a good time to get more side quests done both to learn your way around the world and to get your levels and skills up.As a general answer I would do as many side quests as possible before going too far in the main story although there will be ample time and actual pauses in time during the main quest line where you will have the opportunity to continue with side quests that you missed.  In fact the quest that follows Fragments is called Interlude which is one of those pauses.BTW you can score a very nice bow in Trails of the Past so I would definitely do that one now rather than later if you plan on using your Archery skills.,enderal,d934gje,1,t5_2xcc6

The ice hits Ive noticed are outside the range of a cloak too its very strange.Popping up in ark with a cloak spell sounds like a fun mistake though haha. I definitely had some fun the first time the glitch happened in the sun temple I was surprised to see that Calia came to my aid. Together we knocked out most of the place a few times  keepers are essential so they just kept getting back up just to get knocked right back down.,enderal,dbhr8a8,1,t5_2xcc6

10345871,0,t1_dcgninv,It worked! But the same thing happened as it happened before somehow Calia took me to the Dancing Nomad because a group from Duneville came to play. The dialog was completely the same is this intentional?Oh and by patching one of my items enchantment changed.. My circlet of the limbo which gave  Elementarism cost is now  Psionics. ,enderal,dcgri08,1,t5_2xcc6

10553440,0,t3_5qx1bg,Awesome as ever. Makes me wish that Someguy would make a bounty hunting mod for Enderal now like he did for New Vegas.Also Ive just noticed on a recent playthrough that the VA for Jespar also did  voices for the Bounties series as well.,enderal,dd4cnj7,2,t5_2xcc6

10844807,0,t3_5v1dg1,looks good! but could you change the symbol to the malphas one? because righteous armor basically means you walk the rightous path  i guess  so i think the malphas symbol would be more fitting ?also if you ever have the free time could you change the amor that you get for free when you join the holy order?the heavy variant of the keeper armor is like arantheals so thats ok and doesnt need to be changed.but the light armor is just city armor.and the robes are just plain white pleb robes. would be cool if they were red keeper robes.obviously im only asking because im guessing you are going to release your mod at some point ?  or is this just for private use? if yes then just forget what i said D,enderal,ddykdhz,2,t5_2xcc6
10887259,0,t3_5vfpjq,Do you have an idea when exactly it appeared?This general type of bug animation stuck or restless butt syndrome when chairs are concerned sometimes came up in our development and not just for the player the bug where Lishari stands on her chair is another instance. I never figured out what causes it then again animations are really not my cup of tea. The one thing that definitely fixes it is player.resurrect but this causes lots of collateral damage such as the player losing all spells IIRC. Maybe try messing around with activate player run on some chair in the vicinity several times.,enderal,de2xyq2,2,t5_2xcc6
11002994,0,t1_deeqcig,Yeah we definitely could use some screenshots preferable without ENB in the sections florafaunacreaturesregions etc. Here is a tutorial how screenshots should be uploaded and categorized. ,enderal,def5onx,4,t5_2xcc6
11126365,0,t3_5yuvw9,Can you upload your savegame .ess  .skse at our bugtracker    please? That would help a lot.,enderal,det5wzr,3,t5_2xcc6
11296213,0,t3_60bqf5,As the other guy said its no an ENB. You can easily tell by the bloom and the shadow aura bug that exists unless you set iBlurDeferredShadowMask.,enderal,dfceqlt,1,t5_2xcc6
