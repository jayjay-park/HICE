6479760,0,t1_czotb84,The resolution on both Bluestacks and my Nexus  gen  tablet are the same.  I cant zoom out much which I find annoying.  On Clash of Clans I could zoom WAAY out which was real nice especially when attacking.Ive found no setting for bumping up the res.  I basically pan and drop units as fast as I can lol.,redditarmyalliance,czpjzdj,1,t5_38nbm

7543290,0,t3_4in0b4,I feel like this is a pretty simple and accurate explanation of how we should handle wars. I fall in the middle range and typically try to  star a peer.....sometimes I get it sometimes I dont...if I dont get it I make sure to  star someone lower but realistically every missed  star attack is a missed opportunity. An abridged version of this might be worth mentioning at the start of every war so the ranked people can focus on clearing the lower guys ,redditarmyalliance,d2zmw0p,3,t5_38nbm

8614095,0,t3_4xtywe,This is a snapshot of my base progress. Columns should be self explanatory. Last column is actual days required with full  workers busy. Essentially citizenday divided by . Walls and gates omitted because they are a resource sink that skews progress numbers. Gates are L. Walls are L with a chunk at L. Troop upgrades complete less saboteur. Generals at     and . Tactics complete less Barrage and Heal.No matter what Im within a week of beginning IA advancement. I have  days until  tower progress. My initial plan was that then crank out the rest of my traps and a few economic upgrades timewilling while during my day CC upgrade. However Im really itching to get started on new troop upgrades and aircraft. I have a pretty strong EA base but thats not helping me in world wars anymore. My rank is contiuing to rise while my offense is stagnant. So my other option is to begin the CC upgrade tonight and work on my remaining towers during those  days forgetting about economy Im ok with that.Any insight would be appreciated. Also any tips going into IA regarding anything else  base design attack strategies army composition etc. Im Roman who identifies as British but doesnt want to spend the crowns. I have  crowns which I would be willing to get aircraft as soon as possible or whatever else might be more important.,redditarmyalliance,d6icy4g,2,t5_38nbm
