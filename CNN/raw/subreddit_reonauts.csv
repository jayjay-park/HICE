56994,0,t1_cekmo5m,Soooo I hope you figured out the color scheme for your next one.  I remember when I bought my first one I had another in the mail within a month and a . a couple weeks after that. lol  ,reonauts,cekx3fs,2,t5_2y9ma
602860,0,t1_cg8pcdx,Thanks! Im thinking about a parallel dual coil at about . if I can fit it in the Reomizer.,reonauts,cg8srbj,1,t5_2y9ma
792429,0,t1_cgucnnt,Hopefully it had a very low charge left. Then the idiot goes to try and charge it with a AA charger and experiences a massive let down.,reonauts,cgucptj,1,t5_2y9ma
1972292,0,t3_2ha671,The  does have a much tighter draw. Not quite as tight as the  but comfortable enough to do mouth to lung hits and to tight to do comfortable lung hits. The post holes arent very big on it though so Ive only been able to get dual  gauge to fit through the center post. It feeds well enough but not as well as the  with max VG.,reonauts,ckqv17u,2,t5_2y9ma
3603116,0,t1_cq27579,Yeah my reo has sat idle ever since I lost the door. The sig  is my work horse now. I feel like a regulated  bf mod is the only thing thatd make me ever love my odin again ,reonauts,cq2zbo9,1,t5_2y9ma
3854873,0,t1_cqvo5iy,The workmanship on the Chalice is stunning just like Bugs stuff always is. Amazing machining and a really sweet finish. I think the airflow system on it is clever as all getout but it makes the atty a bit taller than Id like. The screws on the posts are a little trickier than I thought theyd be phillips is so much more forgiving to us shaky old farts but I got it strung up on the first try. Vapes like a champ and the flavor is BUSTIN. You just cant go wrong with a Chalice on a REO.,reonauts,cqvow1e,2,t5_2y9ma
