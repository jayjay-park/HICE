860491,0,t3_23x7oy,Only thing sadder than making up imaginary booking is taking the time to go to a subreddit that does it and make a post criticising the practice for no apparent reason.What a sad fucking loser you would have to be to do that.,fantasybooking,ch23cws,0,t5_2vffu
8533948,0,t3_4wlde7,Owens and Zayn will be tag team championsShield will be together again and you will fight the likes of the Balor Club New Wyatt Family and All American team.Paul Heyman will create a stable with all his guysBrock lesnar CM Punk Cesaro and Shinzuke .Bobby roddes Johnnhy Gargano and Tommaso Ciammpa will have a Glorius Stable,fantasybooking,d68b4nn,2,t5_2vffu
8822992,0,t1_d76n201,I smell a Fatal Four Way Ladder match for womens title coming...Owens is so much easier to work with as a champion though. Hes a cocky guy that likes to beat people if he loses too much what can he boast about? Im hoping he gets to go with Nakamura over the IC title cos thats a feud that is easy to write.Rollins Vs Reigns at TLC for the title just sounds wrong in a fantasy booking scenario ,fantasybooking,d78ehiz,1,t5_2vffu

9009345,0,t1_d7ujmls,Not necessarily I just would curious to see what clan would prevail. A four vs four War Games with Harts vs Von Erichs would be interesting. ,fantasybooking,d7us6eu,1,t5_2vffu
9254092,0,t1_d8p0pmc,I dunno if you watched Smackdown last night or not so I dont wanna spoil anything for you but watch it and then youll see where most of the ideas came from.,fantasybooking,d8p0txy,1,t5_2vffu
9322392,0,t3_57uiha,Im not sure what Id do although its one Ive been sketching out in my head for a long time now but I know how it would start.At Mania Austin would win by beating up The Rock with the chair but not with the help of McMahon. The cage match would be set for Raw the next night. However when the cage is being lowered after the entrances three guys come from the crowd.... Hogan Hall and Nash decked out in black and white. They rip apart the cage and do a good old nWo beat down on Austin and Rock. This allows Rock to be out to film the movie and gives Austin a logical feud.After the beat down Hall gets on the mic and simply says you know who we are but you dont know why were here. He then drops the mic and Raw goes off the air.,fantasybooking,d8xojtt,3,t5_2vffu
9721596,0,t3_5dnnz1,Id go with Goldberg. He just beats him in about a minute. No big deal.,fantasybooking,dabed1q,3,t5_2vffu

10843835,0,t1_ddy8ffs,Thanks. And I think Corbin vs. Ambrose will happen at Mania but I dont know about the street fight stipulation.,fantasybooking,ddygrfx,1,t5_2vffu
11248395,0,t1_df6magj,Just wait.  Its gonna happen. Or if hes not put in the match hell interfere at the end so Reigns can rescue Taker...Not sure how you can like this idea its gross to me but to each their own I guess.,fantasybooking,df6zm2b,1,t5_2vffu
11520613,0,t3_64eiue,Ive always thought those  should be together as a top faction who are antiestablishment antiheros who could be positioned against the system Reigns Brock etc.Gallows and Anderson as tag champs AJ as world champ and Finn as CW champ. ,fantasybooking,dg1v30y,2,t5_2vffu
