370552,0,t1_cfizy3j,I determined that I had a vinegar mother growing because the scoby was covered with brown dust for lack of a better word. It looked identical to the mother that was in the original jar of vinegar. Before I start a new scoby I want to try salvaging the first one since I made the mistake of paying for it.

1549469,0,t1_cj9tmly,first off thanks so much for the indepth reply!! Ive had digestion issues for a long time and last year I got a bunch of tests done I remember one was for H Pylori and I think I may have gotten tested for Giardia as well sounds really familiar. All of the tests came back negative. I made drastic changes to my diet cut out gluten dairy soy etc. and ive been very strict about sticking to it for the past year. All of those changes have certainly improved my digestion a ton but even still I always kind of had a slight soreness in my stomach that never really went away. Now after drinking the kombucha the soreness in my stomach has increased a shit ton with the added bathroom issues and nausea. So maybe you are right!!! From what you said and how im feeling it would totally make sense. For now im going to try my best to stick it out for the rest of the week if no improvements by then ill see a doctor. But im definitely gonna keep all of this in mind! thanks so much!,Kombucha,cjahzn3,3,t5_2qx36

2932218,0,t3_2tn68p,gtLets be honest here. If my SCOBY was an animal the SPCA would have raided my house a long time ago. Ive let that thing go for over a month. Ive made batch after batch without so much as rinsing the jar. I forgot to add that sugar once and realized  days after starting a brew. Ive accidentally poured too much and had half as much starter as I should have. Ive done lots of stupid things at this point and it keeps on thriving. Whatever happens I just make a new batch and its fine.This is the best thing Ive ever read in this sub. Giving examples of what youve done wrong is a great help to this community. Personally Ive done a few of those myself and my SCOBY is still producing the sweet nectar we all love. Brewing is just about experience and getting comfortable with the process kinda like being a new parent. After you get the hang of it you dont worry as much because you know your SCOBY will be fine.  edit words,Kombucha,co1ela8,2,t5_2qx36
2934207,0,t3_2tqoa8,Technically tea is a specific plant  camelia sinensis sp? which naturally contains caffeine. What we call herbal tea is not actually tea but concoctions made from other plants. I dont think it is caffeine specifically that scobys need in order to survive but some other nutrient contained in tea. Ive heard of people using herbal teas to make kombucha but then brewing a regular batch every other or every third batch to keep the scoby healthy. While I agree with the other poster that people make scobys out to be a lot more fragile than they are I doubt one would survive on herbal tea alone. ,Kombucha,co1mqsi,5,t5_2qx36

That being said I also pour it through a filter into my glass after cause Im picky about slime. As far as the rest.. No your scoby size doesnt really matter through a really large versus really small one can change the speed of the process a bit I think? Nothing significant.. The carbonation is definitely all about filling the bottles up the less space the more quickly the gas will fizz up. But also the more quickly it could explode.

The resulting kombucha gives me similar flavors you describelike a sweettart hawthorn berry. I decant it into swingtop bottles when it has a distinct vinegary smell but tastes a balance of tart amp sweet. It hasnt gone sour on me yet. I just cant get it to pause making scobabies during F. ,Kombucha,der1n1z,2,t5_2qx36
