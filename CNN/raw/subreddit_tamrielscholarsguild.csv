1565739,0,t1_cjcj5n8,Youll forgive me for interjecting I hope. I swing around the corner to look at the two Dunmer. Nobody ever said I was wise. You two are concerning... To put it mildly and not to over step my bounds of course however... You two seem to be talking about very dangerous things and while two years ago this wouldnt be an issue this island is now home to average people. The sort that get the worst of it when dangerous things come back to the island. I think you understand you most of all Zirath that were already on tenuous ground harboring Thalmor fugitives and letting them escape seeing as we are on an Imperial Charter... I notice Im rambling and take a drink from the cup of tea in my hand and am met with few wet dregs I had finished it already. Still it gave me a moment to breath. I pull the cup from my lips and look again. It doesnt seem very advisable if youll pardon my forwardness. ,tamrielscholarsguild,cjcjefq,3,t5_2tx3y

2194196,0,t1_cliacrj,I protect my interests because my interests are those of wide breadth. If it were merely me I would let the Justicars and the Thalmor at large tromp wherever they want on the island. I shrug. As it is that isnt the case and as such I will do what I can to keep them off my shores.I scratch at my chin. And while they can come calling if they so wish there is the issue of pier space weather and a host of other bureaucratic issues that would need to be addressed. It is highly inconvenient to snoop here by my own design. They are curious as others are but it too much work to actually get here.And as for my assistance it is yours until this endeavor ends. Power is shifting rapidly in Tamriel it is nice to not sit on the sidelines.,tamrielscholarsguild,cliqijw,1,t5_2tx3y

3293505,0,t1_cp3nxa4,The ancient pouch comes free accompanied by a small grunt from me. Aye that is what others call her I suppose another aspect as it were. I clear my throat and hobble back to the stool. Though I prefer the Nord way of thinking.With another grunt I plop myself back onto the stool and drop the pouch with a thud. I begin to fiddle with the strings. I prayed to her ceaselessly in my youth even when I started rummaging in ruins far beyond her sight.She is a pillar of strength to many of my kin including me our divine mother she is. The twine is proving harder than expected to cone undone I point to a short but very sharp knife hanging on the wall near Arkil. Pass me that will you?,tamrielscholarsguild,cp3opmk,2,t5_2tx3y

6003543,0,t1_cy61dro,Erm... yes.I unconsciously look at my hand while opening and closing it.Its just a rune of summoning. I have one on most of my belongings. When I activate it the object connected to it teleports to me.I pat my bag spiritedly.So what do you say? Should only be a few minutes before she comes out. The hall isnt too far but getting out of the town can be tricky if you dont know your way around. I can handle your application too once were up there.,tamrielscholarsguild,cy6lewy,1,t5_2tx3y

I say draping an arm around Rukis shoulders and pulling her in next to me What are you payin me for if I cant handle a few crazies and beasties? Ill be fine.And then Ill come back and Hjolfr can enchant my blade and make it even better than it already is which is sayin something lemme tell ya after which I will be able to protect the shit outta you.,tamrielscholarsguild,d5q8i8d,3,t5_2tx3y

8621670,0,t3_4xhgha,It had been maybe... an hour or two since... since... I pull the blanket around me. There wasnt a word for it I honestly was starting doubt it was ever real but it had to be. The pillow and the book had been thrown around the room. So why couldnt I remember what it was? What it sounded or looked like? I could only remember that it touched me. If it touched me it has to be real... right? I even looked at my stomach and there was nothing there. There had to be something... anything... I wasnt crazy. Hjolfr would help... if he wouldnt just laugh in my face and ask if I had scary dreams. No he had to help me. Whatever did has to pay for it.... ,tamrielscholarsguild,d6jb647,1,t5_2tx3y

9654159,0,t1_da2kgov,I studied them a little when I was undergoing my training years ago but never delved too far in unfortunately.I did have a few questions if thats alright.. Such as... Like the Ayleids and their many ruins dotting Cyrodiil are there any known sites attributed to the Falmer? I understand there are a few attributed to both them and the ancient Nords but I cant say Ive ever seen Falmer architecture let alone any hint of a city or sign of a capital.,tamrielscholarsguild,da32qru,2,t5_2tx3y
10197505,0,t1_dbxr67y,I have heard of that library I interject as I come up on the pair. I had put my things away readied my cot and had left a few mixtures to set. Oh... and made myself a mug of coffee in the meantime which I now cradle in my hands a small stream of steam trailing off it as I walk across the deck and take a seat on a barrel next to Ruwen.Taking a sip of my drink I rest it along with my hands in my lap and continue Papa once told me that it was filled with books the way a beach is filled with an infinite amount of sand... I have long wished to see it but for obvious reasons such a thing is all but impossible.,tamrielscholarsguild,dbzxzgv,3,t5_2tx3y
10246020,0,t1_dc4gus4,That is by design of course. In the Sea of Pearls there are enormous beasts that locate prey by sound and which can both swim and fly and which can break apart a warships hull with a gust from its tremendous gossamer wings. It would be a pity to make it almost to Thras only to be sunk by a Souriceti.,tamrielscholarsguild,dc5fynq,2,t5_2tx3y
