1577555,0,t3_2cbolo,Theres a list of gigs not sure how comprehensive. Also I would definitely recommend Kallio especially in the daytime. There are some great bars its a lot cheaper than most areas and the people are... interesting. Take the subway east from the city centre hop off at Srninen and bathe in the glory of Helsinginkatu and Vaasankatu. There are a few good ones outside of that area but those are the boulevards of drunk.,helsinki,cje0v7i,5,t5_2s0h4

5489108,0,t1_cwd7bql,Well cheap and near the centre dont go too well together even Kallio and Vallila are very expensive nowadays.. Id maybe move east along the metro line until you find suitable prices. For example Herttoniemi is much much cheaper already and you can reach the centre under  minutes if you live near the metro station.If you decide to live somewhere near the centre or in the centre Id go see the area at night to find out how noisy it is and how much urine  puke there is at the corridors. ,helsinki,cwda8ux,1,t5_2s0h4

10867326,0,t3_5vaztt,You should buy a pack of some cheap bulk lager preferably Karhu Koff or Lapin Kulta from a store preferably SMarket and go sit at Hietaniemi beach. Then you should proceed to drink the beer until you feel Finnish enough to go hit on girls between the age of  and  sixteen is the age of concent here so dont go lower than that  you might even get a small fine!. Then when you get turned down by the teenagers you should drink more maybe at some bars in the Kallio district  Pub Roskapankki perhaps?. When youre feeling happy again or have at lest dulled the pain inside you might want to find a park bench and get some sleep.Next day you can repeat the same but maybe with some kilju And then just rinse and repeat.,helsinki,de0vylg,6,t5_2s0h4
