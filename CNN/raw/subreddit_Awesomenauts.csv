564401,0,t3_20izgo,Hey there.  Wanted to repost what I posted in another thread about my Froggy build. Current build Dash amp Run . Solar Tree . Splash Dash . Boots . Hammer Pants  . If quick solar gain Hydro Smash . If slow solar gain Hydro Splash  . Power Pills Light  . Gun damage gun speed and piercing shots any order you preferthat solar gain allows . Tornado . Cant Touch This . Twister Tweeters  . Boom Box This build is all about high damage fast burst right off the bat paired with INCREDIBLE escapability. I have played many Froggy builds in my time playing Nauts and while of course hotfixes and ability changes make certain builds more viable than others this one has granted me the most success overall. The build relies on VERY smart grounddashing with a lot of foresight and knowledge of when characters are going to meet you on the ground but when you get these down Froggy becomes one of the most frustrating characters to play against.With a maxed out splash dash tree and the correct use of hammer pants EACH dash deals  damage to ANYONE you hit multiple enemies included. On top of this almost nothing can keep you from simply jumping away to safety. I have found that with this build tornado is basically a nonissue until lategame. The build is designed for survivability chasing weak targets and finishing them off.Once splash is maxed go for the HP for more survivability and then your gun upgrades to become both an incredible turret pusher AND droid destroyer.  damage shots at max attack speed and piercing shots  dead droids. Not to mention that the fast highdamage pistol nets me a solid  to  of my overall kills just because many times dash doesnt completely finish off an enemy but my quick pistol does. The reason I dont take Mutant Worms Limited Ninja Edition is because my firing skills arent always the best and if I assume that I miss  of my postdash shots that is a VERY important upgrade speed or damage for instance which are incredible for turret pushing that I am missing out on.Endgame I get tornado and shield first so I can dash into turrets tornado to soak damage while dealing damage to the turret and then run away. Typically I find that since this build limits your mobility while nadoing the gun is a way better finisher postdash than tornado is. Back in the day when dash provided a HUGE stun upgrade and you could deal something like  damage with a single dashstunnado combo tornado was a much better finisher. Now not so much.Last important note DO NOT be too eager to die. My rule is if I am under  health even if I have a great opportunity to be Froggy I will wait to grab some more HP first. Another bonus to the build is that if you get fed well most players will not expect a Froggy to deal as much damage as you will be so early on. To do this you need to not die.Even without my regular preform this build is commonly  of my nonpreform matches netting me s s and a  most recently. Granted I have not gone up against a GenjiDerplClunk bite snare group but I mean... Who can predict that!? Haha.ADDITIONAL NOTES You could replace boom box with Turbo Tape to increase escapability lategame and in fact this is something I will probably incorporate into the build since I dont use the tornado to deal Nautdamage very often.Another one of my rules that makes this build either incredible or terrible Wait wait for the love of Zork WAIT! Dont just run in and dash because enemies are near. Dont airdash a nearfull health character just to deal nonlethal damage when that dash could open you up to a trap a cocoon or anything else that could kill you. This build is reliant on super high dash damage and hammerpants is a HUGE part of that. When you see a battle going on to your left or right and no one is an easy kill wait it out a bit. Now if your allies have wounded a dude and he is running follow him. Get under him and wait until he is forced to land. Watch for double jumps and flyers and when you know that he FINALLY has to land time it perfectly to do a quick tiny jump and dash into the ground where he lands. For a retreating naut that is almost always a kill. For a v where the enemy isnt really hurt predash a good bodyblock and pistol spray can end him easily.If you ever have any questions or want to play a round see some Froggy techniques absolutely feel free to hit me up in a PM and we can make it happen!,Awesomenauts,cg4ff5x,1,t5_2tvrv

1221568,0,t3_2831e2,Raelynn has good lane control initiate and finishes. Not very good at endgame though.Skolldir is a good allround character that can separate team fights and setup kills with throws and bodyblocking people to death in front of friendly turrets. Needs alot of getting used to attack animation and timing and also movement with jumps. Can also allow teammates escape with an earthquake snare.Sentry and Skree are good behind turret defenders as they can block off positioning in front of the turret with Black Hole and Sawblade. Sentry is also good for incapacitating entire teams allowing for possible wipeouts.Swiggins also has great kill setup altough hes not that great at lane control until mid gameish. His hook can do some good damage on creeps but is fairly easy to hit a wallfloor or enemy which will drag yourself to that destination and endanger yourself.Voltar is good at lane control and keeping himself safe with knockbacks and major damage bursts. Also needs getting used to movement and positioning as Ive seen many just standing idle behind a teammate spamming heals. You need to be ready to move at a moments notice since you can easily get picked off if youre not ready for it.My suggestion is just to keep trying out more characters and trying out new builds. Every naut has many different playstyles depending on your loadout.

Nevertheless I agree with ueagle the game needs a normal map.More info on the loading screenI feel like there could be more information on the loading screen such as the map and team composition. It doesnt make sense to have to press tab at the start of each match to see that after being waiting for  minutes for everyone to join.Change the build after having more infoPicking the build before the game starts is a little bit too soon I dont know who I am playing with against who I am playing with or even in which map Im playing.I get that the idea is to keep the game simple and thats fine. Nevertheless the game is quite asymmetric on this choice i.e. the last player to join a team can see what nauts his teammates picked.Again I think this is something that could be moved to the loading screen assuming we had more information there.,Awesomenauts,cirmoo4,2,t5_2tvrv

1571049,0,t3_2c8vx6,Bait and snare is kind of difficult to implement because theres a lot of prediction needed as to when people will fall into snares. Placing them in the right spots helps though.Snare Placement Never in the paths of droids Directly under a frequented platform On top of of platforms accessible to only other nauts On the very edge of hiding spots Above other awesomenauts people tend to jump in panic and taking advantage of this is a must for actual players but is difficult to put into AI In the paths of jumppadsBut yeah an A.I Derpl should just get base items and build into turret and cats before anything else nuke would be very difficult for an AI to handle unless clearing droids I think. Siege in hiding spots and when attacking turrets mostly.Deployment pads is a must and should probably be purchased early. The other  turret upgrades can be whatever. For cats Id recommend not putting in attackspeed because bots tend to get nuts endgame and having a catspammer bot would just be... difficult to counter. Id recommend replacing attackspeed with fatcat or Split Personality Cat that upgrade really should be called Split Personalkitty. Again snare amp siege derpl will not bear half of what makes snare so powerful which is prediction. As such I dont think its the right direction for an AI. ,Awesomenauts,cjd7dku,4,t5_2tvrv

1592518,0,t3_2ch640,Maker of the Vinnie bot here.That... was pretty embarrassing. Vinnie is normally way better then that.Ill address the issues I noted.Vinnie can get stuck on Sorona where you observed and on a corner in Ribbit. However it will free itself in  seconds. I cant make this timer shorter for risk of it triggering when Vinnie is in a combat scenario.Vinnie does have issues on Sorona in terms of turrets. This is due to the lack of pathfinding nodes in the air for flying bots to use. Vinnie thinks he needs to reach the ground by the turret to escape but is forced upwards by turret fire.Vinnies escape ability is also limited due to a bug in my code that I have fixed. The new version is unofficially released i.e. you can download it as a mod bot on the official forums but Ronimo hasnt updated the Vinnie AI that they have. The bug was basically that if Vinnie was below  health vinnie would attack if targets were nearby but wouldnt aim at them. Kinda stupid how I missed that for so long.Thanks for posting this video! One final note Vinnie tends to preform better on normal awesomenauts matches. I dont really know why this is but it seems to hold true. EDIT It is because bots do not take previous deaths into account in randomnauts. Vinnie acts more intelligently if he detects that he is feeding the enemy but Vinnie cannot check for feeding in Randomnauts.,Awesomenauts,cjfwocf,5,t5_2tvrv

1652984,0,t1_cjmi1xc,Most of the time you should avoid Sentry as Clunk but be aware that Clunk has a big enough burst that he has the option of brute forcing through the shield to burst and stun Sentry to low enough health for your teammates to follow up and get the kill. Unless Sentry has maxed Microfilm and Pills you can usually burst him down like this.

1655046,0,t3_2da64f,I agree with most of the points in this post but I feel like its shortsighted to assume that because a skill doesnt increase flat DPS it isnt useful.BlazeYouve suggested that extended duration isnt viable  I disagree. I run extended duration along with the speed upgrade and with the two I can get from the base on Ribbit to the enemys first turret or further. So hows that viable? Well for one it grants the best mobility in the game even if only temporarily. Combine that with the upgrade set youve suggested for Lightning Ball and you can dive turrets or jump into stupidly dangerous situations and escape unscathed provided you dont get snaredstunned. Speaking of Lightning Ball cooldown isnt as bad as youve suggested. Lets say a standard match lasts half an hour. If you opt for cooldown that leaves you with  Lightning Balls to fire off throughout the match. Without cooldown its only . Not a big difference you might think but the total damage from cooldown if you landed every single shot would be . Only  without cooldown but lets make some additional assumptions because who lands every shot except for probably Yeezus?Lets say with range instead of cooldown you land  out of every  shots. That ends up being .If you skip range and go for cooldown even if you miss every th shot you still deal more damage than you do with range. In fact even if you only land  of every  shots you still deal a total of  damn near what earn with range and  better hit percentage. As for autoattack... yeah. I cant argue with you there. I use lifesteal sometimes but its utility is pretty scarce unless I want to go heal myself on some druids so as you said usually damage superconductor and attack speed are the most useful. Pedantry aside I agree with you overall. Coco is getting boxed into a handful of  or  builds that are virtually identical save one or two substitutions which seems to suggest to me that her upgrades should be reworked. Why offer filler upgrades if nobody would ever use them due to a lack of utility?,Awesomenauts,cjns5y1,3,t5_2tvrv

Correct old  balanced but in this case this is both old and has never ever been even a slight problem balance wise. Lastly it does make sense its an ability in the game that works exactly as youd expect from the animation you see. Thats like saying Pennys Pounce doesnt make sense because its a linear dash and she knocks the enemy back instead of being a parabolic leap where she lands on top of the person. As for promoting camping and defensive gameplay I dont think anyone sees this as a problem at all and it honestly feels weird that you would pick this insignificant aspect to want changed when there are biggermore common balance changes that needs work.,Awesomenauts,cjproa0,4,t5_2tvrv

1684011,0,t1_cjrem9q,Yes I still play Awesomenauts. Im actually pretty active on this sub. I cant imagine leaving the game behind at this point. Its my favorite game of all time by far. You can go digging through my post history if you want to see what else I have to say about Awesomenauts I spend most of my time here P.Im a much better player now than when I wrote this guide for sure but its hard to say what I would add exactly since so much strategy is character specific but Id probably say the biggest thing I didnt cover enough in this guide is pushing. If positioning is the art of not dying then pushing the art of winning. Pushing is the measure of how effective you are at damaging turrets and bases. Split pushing covering both lanes at once is an essential tactic to victory so always make sure someone on your team is keeping track of the other lane. Usually split pushing just involves destroying droids so that your turret stays safe. If you never and die and push when you can youll be one of the best players in the game. The way you get there is to be thoughtful and calm or at least not enraged during your matches and watching replays especially games that you lose. Also find some friends to play with. The feedback and discussion I get from playing with other people has been crucial to my improvement. ,Awesomenauts,cjrfl1f,1,t5_2tvrv

1939587,0,t1_ckmwekq,I always like the idea of boots but can never work them in. Then again a lot of games I hold off on extra health until late game anyway so maybe the answer is there or in regen.Double slow on blaze is kinda fun. I have played with extra DoT as well and it works too. Sort of depends on the team Im facing. Though someone in all of that slow is so easily shredded.My problem with super conductor is that it doesnt blend well with the other upgrades. All my other upgrades stack on each other for better effects. Ball damage is multiplied by cooldown reduction and is amplified by blaze. Blaze effects on the enemy are amplified by slow andor DoT. AA is massively boosted by blaze slow. AA attack damage and speed work well together and lifesteal or structure damage if Im feeling saucy blends in seamlessly using other upgrades to improve itself.Super conductor is not improved by any AA upgrades and is single opponent damage instead of AoE damage. It begs to be used at range which wastes any AA upgrades you bought. And it is homing so you dont control its target. It is indeed powerful but I find that Coco excels because a good build uses each next upgrade to make the last one more valuable at least moreso than Ive seen in other characters. Super conductor would however mesh well with boots. Boots help you control engage distance better which helps super conductor. Maybe if I can make the switch to boots I can also look at it.,Awesomenauts,ckmwyfx,3,t5_2tvrv

2042363,0,t3_2i6hrm,gt Flashy Glasses price increased to  from  Flashy Glasses now increased the damage of Snipe by  Flashy Glasses now reduces Snipe range by Rae can now do  damage snipes at normal range in the current beta. For the longest time its been standard for Rae to max out her snipe damage and maybe grab a level of range right at the start of her game. Raelynn players do this because the snipe harass is incredibly helpful and often kills players who dont respect the zoning. Its normal to have  damage with extra range in midgame and the only reason you stop building snipe at that point is because the other upgrades arent nearly as compelling for harass and kills.So you can see why the new flashy glasses is incredibly strong. Adding this much damage does not seem necessary and the range nerf isnt enough of a nerf to compensate. I think Ronimo figures this upgrade will be used to turn snipe into a pushing upgrade but I dont foresee that happening. You can increase your range back to normal with the  from Gryc Lubricator for  Solar. So you can essentially pay  solar for a direct  damage increase which is more expensive than the standard damage upgrade but still worth it. If you build into range before flashy glasses you can take advantage of the extra range for a portion of the game before locking in the extra damage around the  minute mark.TLDR The new flashy glasses is going to give Rae a much stronger late game when shes already a decently balanced naut.

2156740,0,t3_2jpukl,I play both Gnaw and Lonestar in league .  They play quite differently so there is only a few general tips that both share.  Like having map awareness and seeing when teammates need support and using slow spitbull to help teammates get kills or get away. Also your builds will have to vary based on who you are against and what the map is typically.For gnaw it is all about denying territory with your weedlings.  So you retrain how the the enemy team can move about.  I like getting an early weedling health so characters like raelynn and coco cant one shot them.  Beyond that it varies whether you want to get your DOT abilities up on bite and spit damage or put more upgrades into weedlings.Ive seen people play out lonestar in a lot of ways.  I like to get trinamite right away with a piggy bank so you have a  dmg burst.  You need to either be melee range or above them to really get the hits.  So I tend to focus on that dynamite for the start getting lifesteal and dot.  Lonestar is one of the best pushers in the game with bull and dynamite to clear drone waves and quickly take out turrets.As far as characters that are good for beginners I would say Vinnie and Raelynn would be fine choices.  And the only one to be weary of is Derpl as immobility requires a lot of understanding of the game.  And I think Yuri can be pretty tough as he cant move and shoot.  So in fights you have to choose your engagements very carefully.  But Im no expert on either of them.,Awesomenauts,cldyywb,3,t5_2tvrv

This is from a game that used to pride itself on weekly updates.Highly anticipated features were promised then not delivered or botched trading of pros selling items eventually changed to recycling items via a gambling system a highly anticipated female enforcer character a proper tutorial etc. Money from the massively funded Planetary Annihilation campaign was not used to rejuvenate SMNC so it is utterly unsurprising the game remains dead.Compare this to Awesomenauts where there is a steady drip of updates balance skins map changes new characters replays custom games where the number of staff and community involvement has been on the increase translations bot AI scripts beta tests web tools tournaments I dont see the same story at all.Moreover it is MUCH easier to buyintroduce Awesomenauts to new players than it is with SMNC.

Lonestar doesnt have reduced damage against turrets so its increasing its pushing power. Lonestars Blaster also has a bigger range faster attackspeed and is a major chunk of lonestars damage. So unless you figure out how to nuke and melt faces while being highly mobile as skolldir you cant just compare them like that. Penny mostly does her damage through abilities and having the sustain item not on those abilities frees up a slot for another upgrade. Skolldir on the other hand does most of his damage through his AA meaning healpunch takes away an upgrade slot for his main form of damage.PS No one really takes oily while theoretically great its not worth it.,Awesomenauts,cofn75t,12,t5_2tvrv

3347718,0,t3_2yh4mo,I hover between Leagues  because I like to try all the characters.But I would argue im fairly good with Yuri as I tend to win most games when playing him. So let me just share what I typically do as Yuri!Obviously your mines are going to be your bread and butter so on drop I would recommend getting those  The damage boost right away. In doing so every time an enemy makes a mistake they either have to run or are at a heavy risk for death.This also enables you to defend your lane since those droids will get MASSACRED. So the enemy team cant push if they want to. Go for the cheap mines in the beginning of the game EX Mines where the bouncers will send enemies. This enables both a sense of fear and a sense of awareness in the enemy. Eventually they will stop using the bouncers if they have any sort of thinking capacity. From there you can play mind games.Refuse to be predictable on where you drop them after you notice them no longer making those mistakes. They wont suspect mines in new locations... and yet they will still most of the time never go back to those bouncers. After that every once in awhile put mines back where the bouncers send people. Usually theyll make mistakes.The rest of the build is essentially gaging the enemy. If theyre prone to your mines just keep making them hurt more. If youre in a pickle get some bootsspeed shieldheal shield.If youre in a good position upgrade the laser to help clear waves faster.The biggest decision in Yuris overall match to me is deciding to make them bounce or not. People underestimate the speed of gravity on those babies and they can make an excellent wall to save your life. Along with that they make for some great base defense or enemy base heckling because theyll try and get to you... but theyll be too many mines bouncing around.Cheap plays? Yes. But sometimes you just gotta do it.,Awesomenauts,cp9v5zq,3,t5_2tvrv

Staying evasive helps too a player can always choke. Its not fun having to count on this happening but its nice for you when it does. Leon isnt as much of an issue grab boots earlier and maybe the bigger bull upgrade and you have two good ways of dealing with him... or at least peeling him off of you. Dont wonder too far from your team mates. Lonestars mobility is good because of the triple jumps from boots but his speed is low.

3576291,0,t1_cpzwogr,Calm your tits i didnt make any statements about anything you just said. It was meant to point out that this situation isnt black amp white as you make it out to be.EditDecided talk to you about this.So lets say someone is really bad at the game which causes a great disadvantage and doesnt want to leave the game to give his teammates a fair chance. In the worst case he is ruining the fun for  other players in the best case he is ruining the fun for  other players.No matter what the case will be the netgrief caused by this stubborn player is always greater than the grief received by this one player. Yeah he is in full rights to stay in the game and continue fighting there is not a single question about that but the old rules of life still hold up You can be right but you can still be an asshole.Remember that you do NOT play this game alone you are impacting other people aswell. Thats why the frustration and the insults happen in the first place.You can take the whiteknight approach and defend the one guys feelings like you clearly do or you can take the side of the majority that is being effected. Most people would defend the poor guy being insulted by the others because insults are bad and the initial aggression doesnt come from the guy being insulted completely ignoring the fact that his actions are insulting aswell. There are always two sides of the coin you have to look at both of them.Now what i personally do when i play really badly i ask my teammates if i should leave or stay. Most people dont even respond and keep on playing. If they insult me afterwards i dont care i asked them i gave them their chance they are being labeled the assholes here in my book.What i do if someone in my team does really bad? The same thing happens i ask them to leave so we can have a chance at winning. If they stay they are the clear assholes in my book and i probably will vent my frustration with insults releasing the anger because thats human and most people playing awesomenauts are humans.I wished more people would do this because it already made a difference in many games i was in.,Awesomenauts,cpzxam6,1,t5_2tvrv

It is easy to say that X needs nerfs and while i agree with most points i.e. Silence Cloud or Slow on Nibbs being too strong and in need of changing it is important that we do not drive the game to a stale and uneventfull state.For players that have been around for a while this is known as the nerf cycle and i really hope that we are breaking it rather than keeping the nerfs coming.

5060750,0,t1_cut87k7,Just an FYI I dont think the difficulty has anything to do with potential and more to do with the barrier of entry for learning the character.  IMO I think the difficulty settings should be tweaked a bit like making Clunks difficulty hard.I think Ronimo kinda goofed with his previous nerf and then this buff. He was in a good spot for the most part before they started tweaking him. All he really needed was a slight tweak to dynamite damage. While his mobility was good before he wasnt fast and landing a bull would be necessary for an escape. I do think that the bull can be avoided with regularity from experience. His mechanics like some other nauts are inherently powerful to this game. I think any ability that effects damage output pushing or positioning will always have an advantage.,Awesomenauts,cuw0fft,1,t5_2tvrv

You can already turn off the whole chat or you could simply make an option to turn off just the enemy team to have any communication to you by default but leave the inteam chat on for example. There is a lot less inteam bickering than between teams and its helpful to talk to your own team while it downright makes no sense to talk to the enemy team while playing this game. Lets get this argument debunked already I feel like it has been holding off the freeplay discussion for too long.On to your main argument you just say it might be risky and it might be hard to make a moba freeplay... really? Literally every other moba can do it somehow it must be magic! sarcastic faceAnd dont say only traditional mobas can do freeplay because Smite did it and its successful for it. Ask yourself what other moba is payplay? Exactly. Either its so obscure because everybody just hears pay for a moba and immediately looks away or it probably died from lack of players a long time ago.

5950339,0,t3_3wsgya,Now I am going to be THAT GUY and ask yall kindly to shut up about the game dying. Do you want newcomers to enter this subreddit and see the game dying threads? I have expreienced this very situation with a few games in the past namley Bloodline Champions and Dawngate Yes the game you love is not as popular as you would want it to be nor as popular as it deserves to be. Yes it hurts. But that is fine.You cant force a game to be popular unless you are Blizzard.  You may throw money at YouTubers Twitch streamers sponsor esport events promotions sales and such all which Ronimo has done multiple times in the past. TotalBiscuit even speaks highy of Awesomenatus and calls it his jam every time it is brought up but it will only get you so far.Just look at a pewdiepie for instance. He promotes many games for the millions who watches his content yet only a fraction of the viewers actually try out the games he promotes. They are there for HIM his personality. Not the games.So please. If you enjoy playing Awesomenatus continue to do so. Tell your friends and family about it. Send them a copy this holiday and play it together with them. Promote Awesomenatus on your social media pages. But PLEASE dont let the reddit overflow with negativity. Avoid headlines which spark controversy. Dont repeat the missteps of Bloodline Champions.  It WILL hurt the game in the long run and scare away newcomers. Why would they want to invest time and resources into a sinking ship?I am sure Ronimo is doing their best within their budget considering the whole team is now working hard at the game to make it better then ever.

10231748,0,t3_5mh0he,sort of depends. Do you play with friends you can communicate with? If so the tether support build is usually the way to go. Go for increased range first as it gives you more opportunities. Then damage and whatever else. If you are by yourself then an auto attack build with tether on the side would probably be better. I get life steal damage and then either range or more shards but the last upgrade is up to you.I never go the offensive build on his invuln I think thats a trap. Healing and speed up after use are my two preferred upgrades on that ability. Saving it and timing it right can ensure you almost never die.

11008974,0,t3_5x2ryb,I have almost  games played with Scoop so I think its safe to say I have a decent amount of experience with him.Scoop got his damage nerfed pretty hard both in the hammer and bindings category. I used to focus on a hammer and binding oriented burst build but now I focus on being more a support and brawler. I usually start by getting boots for extra speed then getting Twister Lance for the extra hammer range. After I get both tiers of Ice Queen. At first I thought it got nerfed pretty hard being changed from a damage increase to a slow but the slow is very powerful. The large AOE allows you to slow many targets at once and allows you a couple seconds of time to capitalize on landing your sword strikes. After that I buy Snow Cone for engaging in fights and an escape tool after which I start to build into my AA.Double Licker is a must and it is always the first AA purchase I buy. The extra damage and life steal is really worth the price. After that I buy Halberd. Honestly I never see it picked but I love the new Halberd. The extra  damage boost on sword when you hit an enemy with your hammer is quite powerful. When used in conjunction with Ice Queen you can do quite a bit of damage on slowed enemies with it. After investing into AA I get both tiers of Brutally Whipped for extra hammer damage and then I get both tiers of Sword in the Cream. With this build it is possible to get sword strikes of over  damage late game because of the  damage boost halberd grants that is if the players can capitalize on those few seconds of extra damage.For the rest of the build I just get maximum health and shielding and on bindings the increased heal and heal over time for a maximum tanky build with lots of sustain for brawling.,Awesomenauts,defu4ic,2,t5_2tvrv
