As the rented property Im in now is loaded with damp Im having to throw away things Ive hoarded for years on a weekly basis so as Ive survived and it hasnt killed me Ive taken the decision to only move house with a single vans worth of items. ,InteriorDesign,cf40rm9,4,t5_2r5qs

262402,0,t3_1x3otv,Define the major components figure out which are most important to you figure out what you want for them. Then fill in the gaps until you have a finished product.You want a bitchin shower? Get that bitchin shower. A bidet? Alright you might need to plan a new space for that. Dualflush toilet? Not hard to plan for probably just goes right in where the old one did. Dont even think the plumbings that much trickier. A tub discrete or with the shower? Single or double sinks? How much counter space besides? Cabinets beneath? Woah thats a whole nother approach and you should take all approaches and assess the results Id say average but the exact average might suck yknow. Anyhow that approach is to look at what you want to put in the bathroom  which at a large scale is just what weve been doing toilet sinks shower tub etc. but then you also need to look at what you use in the bathroom. The available storage methods are generally drawers cabinets counter tops closets shelves in amp out of closet medicine cabinets. I keep my toothbrush head toothpaste floss and deodorant in one pull drawer along with some other incidentals and all my shaving stuff in another dustier drawer. Below in the open cabinet space I keep spares of all bathroom consumables  the above items shower stuff toilet paper. Also down there is anything else hygienerelated and some toilet bowl cleaner. On the counter top I keep anything I use regularly but that doesnt fit into a drawer. My toothbrush handle is up there bc its charging base is which I keep out for convenience. As is my listerine and tongue scraper and of course hand soap.Which brings me to an interesting point. Get a counter top with a place for a bar of soap. Better get one that has such a place that also drains. Ive got these little plastic things that hold the soap at an angle and have a channel so the wet soap residue can drain away. Else your counter gets covered in water and soap residue. So pretty much figure out the major fixtures you want. If they require significant changes different sized shower add something etc. plan for them and figure them out. Also figure out what all youll keep in the bathroom itemwise. Plan out your drawers so you dont end up with  wishing you had  or . Approximate how much cabinet space you need. Would you prefer to have full cabinets beneath the whole counter? Or drawers along the top and cabinet space beneath? Or the two sides are drawers all the way down with two cabinets between? Or Fuck it youre having a pedestal sink and everything but the hand soap can go in the medicine cabinet behind the mirror?Then think about the particulars. Do you want a draining handsoap place? Where should the handtowel holder go? How about the towel rack for other towels? The toilet paper holder? How many outlets do you need? If you want to use a hairdryer the same time as anything else Id suggest consulting an electrician to prepare your shit.and through all this you can also think about materials  do you want to put down some floor tiling? Or tile around the shower?Basically its pick a starting point and start figuring things out until you look up and you know everything you want. Then start doing things and remember theres a ceiling you completely forget to think about.,InteriorDesign,cf7ygl5,2,t5_2r5qs

I am looking into a three year masters program that would include a year of relevant undergrad course work since I dont already have a degree in design. I am starting to play with SketchUP and am going to to learn CAD this summer. I find the pay and hours you note interesting and something to consider. I need to research more the New York market because I feel it would be different than other places. Basically K is require to a decent standard of living here. Thats about what I make now in my current job and am fine starting with that but given the cost of going back to school I would obviously hope to move that up in a few years.

903236,0,t1_ch6x6iy,Right. It seems like an us versus them mentality. I am on both sides of the coin and just wanted to know the opinions of other people. I work with architects and interior designers either RAs or NCIDQ certified professionals and consistently I hear that an RA is worth worlds more than being NCIDQ certified. At the moment I am in agreement with that and I actually have looked into getting both professional certifications but in the end being able to legally stamp drawings versus not is a clear legal win on the side of architecture. In terms of theory I find interior design far more significant in terms of the people to space scale and study more accurate than architecture. In current definition which I dont really agree with conceptually interior design is a relatively new professional field and will be an ongoing climb. How I see it is interior design is still learning how to walk while architecture is a middleaged man with a wife and  kids.,InteriorDesign,ch6ybkv,2,t5_2r5qs

I would suggest that cotton velvet is far more durable than other velvets and would opt for something with a short nap. You can fix velvet to some degree by using a clothing hand steamer and toothbrush. If you do go with a velvet sofa Id suggest that you encourage your partner to not always sit in the same spot and flip your cushions regularly.

1839246,0,t3_2fn8ic,I dont have the exact dimensions right now but I can sketch out a floor plan if it would help.My first thoughts with no experience in interior design. I like the living room but Im not sure about the color of the couch and I wanted a sectional to hopefully fit more people. Also not a fan of the light behind the couch.. The table in the kitchen seems a bit small but Im not sure how to fit a bigger table there unless it goes up against a wall.. Dont know what to do with the kitchen but it doesnt feel put together super vague I know. Something doesnt fit maybe the curtains?. The bedroom seems really bland to me. Im planning on moving the bed up against the wall and probably getting a dark wood bed frame and dressers with white sheets and a tan comforter and pillows.Im a fan of modern and minimalistic. I like the dark wood theme in the lounge and bathrooms but Im not sure if I could do that for the master bedroom as well. I want to do things right the first time and just build up the design piece by piece over the next few months and I have about  to start with so a couch might have to come later when I can save up some more.,InteriorDesign,ckatqc2,3,t5_2r5qs

2571898,0,t3_2p7zwn, immediately a dark mahogany color popped up in my head for the coffee table. A richly stained espresso deepbold more black than brown but more brown than red piece would be nice. Initially I thought an oval one would be nice something juuuust too high to kick your feet up on. But I remembered Id seen other ones that are padded with a stiff filling and a leather top as well as a rack underneath and drawers that were really cool. You could use the top as a table if you really needed but mostly it was good for your feet. The storage options were intriguing though. Target sells reasonably priced things like that. Id think glass would look really great. Think of it as a way to extend the beauty of your hardwood flooring comfortable lighting and unique furnishings. If title was too dark itd be too heavy if paired with the  and I think cheap looking if it was too light. Metal wouldnt be too attractive either and any middle wood tone might seem out of place. heavydiverse greens to balance the warmer aspects of your palace definitely some blacks a touch of rich blue once in a while. Purple if you want to be ballsy.Just my two cents!,InteriorDesign,cmuaaeb,3,t5_2r5qs

2860485,0,t3_2suh2z,You have quite a lot of room. Theres even a kind of pilaster to the side. Painting the pilaster and the overhead beam a darker shade from the wall color will differentiate the room. Also painting the short wall to the right of the desk and behind the desk the same darker color will designate the office area. I know that this is counterintuitive or against common wisdom but Ive seen it done in a basement and it actually has a way of making the ceiling look taller because darker colors recede. I wouldnt go more than a shade or two darker.It looks like you have  framed prints and one print that has been bad and is facing the wall. You also got some junk. The billy bookcase isnt so terrible. I think I would put it to the right of the desk next to the short wall it should tuck in there nicely. There is a little flat pack Ikea couch I suggested to someone else recently for cheap seating. KNOPPARP  It comes in dark grey probably not the most comfortable but nicer looking than a ratty loveseat with a sheet thrown over it. Another option is this foam style sofa bed SOLSTA . The second one is maybe a little more comfy. I dont see the couch you were talking about I literally sat on my rowing machine while my parents sat on the couch for dinner a few months ago or the rower must be in the shared room?.  If all you are looking for is a table and chairs that should be easy. You could try thrifting for a loveseat or CL. I would put the loveseat and dining together because it might be awkward to do both in that space.I made a Little Sketch to illustrate my ideas.Against the wall facing the desk is the little love seat. There is a dinning table DT in front of it and two dinning chairs facing the table. The triangle to the right of the couch is a floor lamp. A coffee Table CT is set between the desk and the Dinning area this is to act as a visual break to introduce lower furnishings and if you want to shoot the breeze you can sit at your desk and the buddies can turn the dinning chairs around to make a converstion area.I would thrift for these items. Look for a sturdy dinning table and look for dinning chairs that have upholstery and are comfortable to sit in. Two dinning chairs as opposed to  or more are hard to sell so you often see them at thrift shops etc.. You can get a coffee table thats quite large but at coffee table height. In fact you may want to splurge there and get a cool one like something from reclaimed wood or old license plates kind of thing. You might try to DIY find an old oak table with a glass top and paint it black put in a metal top and attach wheels so you can move it around. I also drew in a rug for the dinning area which would help to differentiate it make it more cozy.I said something about storage you might want to try a deep shelf like the KALLAX Shelving unit that would go against the wall behind the CT with the CT pushed up against it or pulled out a little bit depending on what you like. In that case you would forgo the art. Or you could lay the Kallax on end you should have room and then you sill have room for the art above. You might have to play with that plan to see how you like it maybe like an L shape with the CT and the Klalax going partway toward the Office or Dinning area.A bit about stylingIn a basement you need to hang artwork a lot lower than you normally would to give the illusion of ceiling height. The low coffee table that lives near the wall will do that as well. On the wall directly behind the CT I would hang the largest of your prints and just a few inches above the CT. You might also try to dress the CT with a tray for snacks or vase or sculptural element like a stack of cool books.Dont try to hang the artwork like a gallery evenly spaced across the wall. One work can go over the DT end again close to the table about  and another can be centered behind the couch. Then rather than hang a work even ways between the CT and desk hang it closer to the desk like it belongs to the office area. It is okay to have some wide areas along the wall without a wall hanging or furniture this will actually help to make the space look bigger and taller believe it or not.Look for a decent table runner to live on the table when it isnt in use this is another area where you can splurge as if that textile were a form of artwork.,InteriorDesign,cnt8lfc,2,t5_2r5qs

Im just getting started on being able to afford some fairly nice things here and there so Im very new to all of this.You seem to like the idea of the gray sofa.

There is nothing wrong with pulling out one color from the artwork like a certain yellow in a sunset or a persons eye color in a portrait but that is really suppose to be the job of the frame and mat.When you have a room that is perfectly matchymatchy to the artwork it tends to be very lifeless looking like a furniture showroom rather than a home.

3948693,0,t3_35npf1,Keep furniture colors light and pieces small and minimal. Maybe opt for a small ottoman rather than a coffee table or even a couch with a chaise lounge on one side. Anything that can serve multiple functions is a big bonus. If you want to add color do so with pillows pictures and stuff that can be easily changed out.Let in as much natural light as possible. Maybe some sheer curtains during the day. And hang them properly At night youll want to have a couple smaller lamps maybe some reading or table lamps next to your couch or something. This will make it look and feel cozier than a bright overhead light will.Keep your storage hidden. A bookshelf thats exposed will make the room feel busy and crammed.

4003507,0,t3_36ah85,If you knock down those walls youre going to be altering the structural integrity of the building and will need to know where the supports are. No one can really advise you on where to move the stairs without the second floor plan either because we dont know whats up there. For example you wouldnt want to move the stairs so the landing ended up where the pluming foot print is for a bathroom. As for knocking down the walls Id chill out on how many you want to knock down. For one thing that floor plan is strange in that the dining room is farther away from the kitchen than the living room. You could knock down the walls between the kitchen dining and living room creating an open plan. That would be a good idea. I very much disagree with the other poster in the resale issue too. If you knock down all the walls you want to  yes it could affect resale value but taking out the walls between the living and dining rooms would actually probably increase it since most buyers are looking for open plans. Id suggest keeping the walls around the lounge and maybe just redesigning the stair case where it is. For example it could come down in an L shape from the existing wall around the lounge opening up more space for what is the dining room which you should swap for the living room. Again though it would be pretty difficult to give you any suggestions on the stairs unless I knew what was on the second floor. ,InteriorDesign,crcmq7r,3,t5_2r5qs

4052092,0,t1_crhhcur,I also have problem with this! Have you tried reading about color theory? It might give insights on which colors go together.Color is very visual. For large noticeable surface areas such as walls color can make or break the room. This not really the boldest move but I also go for neutrals on walls then fullon color for movable pieces and other interior details. Neutral colors have undertones in them so maybe you can choose the one which is suitable for the palette you are aiming for. Make sure it will tie all your interior pieces together.Test the color under your intended use of lighting and also in daylight. This is important because lighting may render the color differently and will not look the same as it is in the swatch.Oh also you have to consider the finish. Is it shiny or matte? Different finishes have different effect on the overall feel of the space.Okay I maybe saying a lot of random things now but I hope I helped a bit.,InteriorDesign,cri64qc,1,t5_2r5qs

I would also consider either repainting it or stripping it to bare wood and refinishing it in oil but I dont know your abilities for a project like that.  And thats also my personal preference other people like different things but I think a dark brown wood would look good with that wall paint color  or a very light color like white or very pale blue?  There are options here.  ,InteriorDesign,ct5rq96,1,t5_2r5qs

Its stark and uninviting so good call on wanting to change it!The key is to select a neutral color that will appeal to as many buyers as possible. Usually a softlight tone is best. Beige might be boring but for show casing your home and creating a welcome feel to buyers its a safe color to go with. Its a little hard to tell but it looks like there may be a brownbeige tone in the carpet already? So beige or tan walls should coordinate with the carpet and get rid of that dirty look. ,InteriorDesign,cuwdkp2,1,t5_2r5qs

I would go for a very pale greenit would compliment those cabinets wonderfully. You can always paint the cabinets if you dont like those but they look to be in great condition.Paint the living room and rehang the drape rods higher and further out around the window to make the room look larger and the window bigger. You can paint the mantel and even the tile on the fireplace if you dont like it.The house looks adorable from the front.

They then give their kids a hard time for watching too much TV..You avoided doing that which is great the next thing I suggest would be to pull any immovable furniture off of any window wall.

7692139,0,t3_4kmyke,I travel a lot for work so I definitely know the hotel style  you have a great start with the wood! Scandinavian beginnings. . Make use of and accentuate your longest wall. Horizontal space is your friend as you dont have so much vertical if at all possible try to move the large dresser from next to the window can it go to the right of the door when you walk in? And buildbuy a full length piece which can run the longest side of your room  like this  Then it can be a multifunctional working space  TVPCetc. . Maximize Hidden storage and remove any unnecessary storage. I see a lot of drawersshelvesetc. that are empty so it is a waste of horizontal space. Quality over quantity and from what I see there is a lot of spare capacity  if you are up for the woodworking you could make something like this slanted wall builtin the top part from your existing bookshelf. Most hotel rooms are essentially empty and modern design is all about simplicity and efficiency.  . Put a headboard on the bed and preferably a reading light or end table  this gives direction to the space. If you cant wire in an LED reading light directly there are some batteryoperated ones similar to this which arent the cheap looking clipon type. . Use as much of the natural light as you can  if you are in the northern hemisphere I assume then if your window is south or west facing you should get a LOT of natural light. If you are worried about privacy there are some diffusing window films you can apply which wont be permanant.  Good luck and enjoy the rentfree life while it lasts!,InteriorDesign,d3gjp5f,1,t5_2r5qs

As much as I agree with your wife that adding more grey just adds to the numerous shades of grey youre already dealing with  I would suggest you can still go with that stone youre showing in the picture and offset it with wood accents in other ways.  If you go with dark cherry wood on the front of the bar or something comparable you would probably want to restain the floor to match which could definitely be a pain in the ass from what Im looking at.  Not only that  suddenly you would have the allgrey menagerie in the basement with a random splotch of wood on the floor in front of the bar and the front of the bar itself.I would consider doing something like this  Go with the stone youre suggesting there for the front of the bar and leave the wood platform on the floor alone.  Then  to offset all the grey in the room get creative with some nice shelving on the wall behind the bar.  Thats where you want to go with that nice cherry wood or whichever stain your wife prefers.  That way it doesnt need to match the floor perfectly and will give a nice accent to the room.  Youll end up with a nice mix of wood tones as well as the dark granite and the grey.  Regarding your budget  Im not sure what youre pricing finishing with that stone but most stone wall tiles should be easily within your range.  That would then leave you with some room left over for some shelving behind the bar which will serve the dualpurpose of giving more character to the room with some offsetting wood tones as well as a functional use of storing liquor or whatever else would look good up there.  You could also add a nice wood wall clock somewhere to break up the grey monotony.Basically I would not use wood on the front of the bar if it were me.  It will end up just looking like a random lot of wood in a sea of grey.  I would add the wood via shelving behind the bar other furniture and wall decor clock or frames etc.  Something like this  Obviously it looks a little rough in what I just threw together quickly but I think it would add wood to give the room some character and breakup all the grey without overdoing it in that one little area in front of the bar.  Compare the above pic against a rough idea of an allwood approach to the front of the bar  You could either match the wood from the shelves to the wood on the floor or you could go with a different tone.  It should work fine either way.  The example I used there was the industrial pipe approach since you can create some really nice DIY shelves really easily for a very reasonable amount of money if your budget is a little tight.  You could easily swap out the plumbing piping with cheap shelving brackets and get the same effect   your only cost would be woodstain in that case.  The squares around the clock would be pictures or otherwise  you get the idea.  This bar would look especially nice like this if you had a pool table flanking it in the basement somewhere to further add some wood accents.  Essentially I think the best approach would be to go with the stone front and try to add wood more sporadically.,InteriorDesign,d3j8623,2,t5_2r5qs

9064738,0,t3_52yjtz,Hello I actually have a friend that has an identical apartment layout. I helped him with his. To start in the dinning room area I would get rid of everything but the table.  this is a link to a wall hanging wine and wine glass rack to clear up floor space. If it just you and you dont entertain much you can go down to a two person table to open up that space. Get seem bar stool for extra guests. For counter space one trick I have learned when prepping meals is to get a large cutting board that cover the sink this gives you extant counter space and you can put it away when done. For the living room Ike carries a really nice oval cofee table with storage underneath for remotes and such that would give you more table with out closing off the room. I would put the guitar in a bedroom on a nice hanging rack its beautiful and should be show off. The video game car rig can go into storage for extra space. You can then move the book self to the corner where the gaming rig Is. So on the wall behind the desk makes that area look like an office. Adding tiny bits of color can also help in making the room more inviting so some accent color pillow or just a single accent wall can make all the difference. Maybe a lighter blue green or even a red could help.,InteriorDesign,d81fo8m,1,t5_2r5qs
9152484,0,t1_d8c4rky,For some reason I misread your post and thought the bed was black as well and the render was just showing a lighter colored bed. But the bamboo bed will definitely give it a nice contrast IMO. I like the idea of the black and white artwork and the plant. Maybe subtle accents of pink in a few places. Are you just doing the back wall in the dark grey and the other walls in another color or dark grey all over? ,InteriorDesign,d8c56eq,1,t5_2r5qs
9152753,0,t1_d8c5il3,Personally I would probably stick with doing the one wall in dark grey and the rest of the walls a lighter color. Like you said too much dark paint could make the room feel too small. Do you get a good amount of light from the two windows? If so I would actually consider doing the other walls in a light grey rather than a white so that the contrast is less harsh and to make it more cohesive. Youll still have the white in the picture above the bed and I assume white trim so that will give you the white accents that help brighten it up and tie everything together. But thats just my two cents! It sounds like its going to be a lovely space ,InteriorDesign,d8c6ekp,1,t5_2r5qs

9358220,0,t1_d921v6k,To be honest I guess I dont NEED any bedside tables my main thing was to have lighting controls and plug points on both sides of the bed Im not sure if NO bedside tables is better given that things are a little cramped just I guess that you probably want to leave space along the north wall to allow people to get out of bed easier so you might as well have a table there as not.In terms of the bathroom wall there are some options I guess in terms of the LEFTside walla make it parallel to the leftside wall of the bedroom  not sure if this helps with the door issue though  it just really make a little space to the left of the toilet but maybe thats not that usefulb move it closer to the leftside wall of the bedroom but keep it at the same angle or else also make it parallel. Theres around . metres from the bottom left corner to the corner of the bathroom and a . metre wide closet so it should be possible to move  inches closer in that direction potentially more if we killed the connecting doors  I have to figure out how useful these are. Maybe expanding in this direction is more useful as the current design is narrower in that dimension. ,InteriorDesign,d92801z,1,t5_2r5qs

Adding a vertical standtabletop on one or more corners will also add towards the design without adding unnecessary clutter. In this situation I would highly recommend potted plants or perhaps even a hanging basket in the corner with creeper vines hanging off of the edge of the basket.  Straighten the rug and table. Please.A few options that you could consider if you would like A different rug with thicker fibersshag type of even bear rug if your style. It matches the earthy tone youve go tin the room. This is also why you can consider adding dark or medium green colors into this room. Consider adding cut stone grey dark grey by terms of backsplash or covering the wall if your budget covers that.

For the TV stand I think youre solely lacking natural wood. I would go with something in a medium dark solid teak like this.  Something like enough that it doesnt clash but dark enough that it blends in.  Another one from the same company.  I think a lot of the reclaimed would stuff looks too tacky something smooth and sleek blends in better if its solid and stained in a way that works with your flooring.Couches are hard. Ive never bought one only inherited. To me the frame  springs  easy of reupholstering are very important. I would rather pay extra for a couch I like and then pay to have it reupholstered when the fabric wears out than buy one thats alright but not worth the thousand bucks to reupholster when it goes causing me to find another one I like...I also value comfort a lot more than style which IMO is the main thing your couch choice has going for it.

10886055,0,t3_5vfqyv,Thanks yall. Its been very helpful. Sounds like I need to do at least one of the following options . increase budget . reduce the scope of work or . ask for consultationedesign rather than full service and manage the project myself. So...do people who have low budgets just have to live in ugly houses?To answer some of the questionsthe house is in good condition and the previous owner has already updated some parts of the house. Really not much needs to be changed from a functional standpoint but I do have to make it ADA compliant for a family member and I thought while Im at it I want to update the s from the rest of the house.I used to make a living as an artist so I do have a strong design sense. I actually designed my first house and got some general contractors to implement the changes but this being the second house I dont want to do it again. I already have a good idea about what I want so no going back and forth on the ideas but I can only do good and I want the wow factor that an interior designer can provide. Plus it was too much trial and error on my end and I just want it done fast this time.I live in Las Vegas and I guess some of the designers I located only do commercial spaces or are working high end residentials. We have a lot of cookie cutter houses and then high end but not much in between. I guess the problem isnt so much whether or not I can achieve the goal on a k budget but there are so many places where designers can make more money.,InteriorDesign,de2thvu,1,t5_2r5qs

10964008,0,t1_deabgff,Thanks for the suggestions!! I already planned to get rid of one of the couches and adding an armchair or chair instead.

10992928,0,t1_dedxuhy,How does wanting to get my masters mean any of what you said? I found another program at Endicott College a  years masters program for students with a undergrad degree in an unrelated field and no portfolio required to apply. Not sure how furthering my education to learn a new skill and change my career to something Id be passionate about is making more serious interior designers look bad but hey. What do I know. ,InteriorDesign,dee0i46,10,t5_2r5qs

11062950,0,t1_deeuegc,I agree with the person below  white washing the brick would be gorgeous. You could replace the mantle with a lighter wood. I always say the easiest way to make design decisions is to pinpoint what style or vibe youre going for and then take a good hard look at anything you do or dont do to make sure it fits that vibe.,InteriorDesign,delytwx,1,t5_2r5qs

11098554,0,t3_5y5b4m,You can easily create an overhang! Two ways to do this are. The easy way. Three or four stable shelf brackets propping up a shelf that meets the edge of the counter. When you move out you can just fill the holes and paint.. The hard way add a large piece on top of the entire top surface that is larger but has a cut out for the original top so it stays put.Creating this will require you to change the surface of the entire island but there are some really great and cheap materials out there. You can even use plywood layered and pressed together then sanded and painted  Ive done this and used chalkboard paint sealed afterwards. The chalkboard creates a soapstone effect.,InteriorDesign,deq0f9n,1,t5_2r5qs
11135315,0,t3_5yz9pu,Id just leave it for a while. I agree with another commenter about adding a wood pile or doing some decor and giving it a good scrub. Its not awful. What you put around it is more critical to making it look good imo,InteriorDesign,deu6dxl,3,t5_2r5qs
11141932,0,t3_5yz9pu,Replacing the tile seems like the cheapest way to make they biggest impact. Watch some diy instruction videos on YouTube and watch Craigslist for budget friendly tile options. Its really not that hard to do. Id go with something bluegrey if youre planning on keeping the same color scheme. Then oil the stove to make it shine and add a woodpile. ,InteriorDesign,deuxdh7,1,t5_2r5qs

11289621,0,t1_dfbnknb,If youre fine room sharing with a child or two long term then having the master on a different level isnt a big deal in terms of lifestyle.  But I dont think technology is really relevant.  Sensors cant soothe a crying baby and a video camera cant change a diaper.  Again if youre planning on room sharing long term this is a nonissue.  But if you want a child sleeping in their own room at a young age you will spend a lot of time running up and down the stairs.  Kids arent little long but this floor plan could make those years rougher.,InteriorDesign,dfbnuou,2,t5_2r5qs

11310948,0,t3_61czyr,To me the tile looks fine Just get rid of the tile running up the wall and replace it with baseboard.. The countertops look fine the backsplash looks fine. Cabinets though Paint them. A color like Gargoyle from benjamin moore. Paint the ceiling with benjamin moores ceiling paint a true flat the sheen in the ceiling is terrible. Get rid of the commercial front door if you can. Looks like an office building door. Paint the walls a neutral color paint the trim a lighter shade. Get rid of carpet as much as you can and use area rugs.,InteriorDesign,dfe2u6b,3,t5_2r5qs

11447033,0,t3_63eq00,I have old black and white photos framed very nicely in my living dining rooms. The photographs hold meaning to us. One is from the s when the first baseball stadium was built. We both grew up going to games there. Another is of the church we got married in. Another one is a photograph of a building from the s that now houses a sandwich shop we like to go. They are all I think  x  photos and framed with a white mat and simple black frame. We didnt rush out and buy everything at once either. Having quality photos printed and framed cost us about  each. We did one at a time as we found photos we liked. ,InteriorDesign,dftiey1,1,t5_2r5qs
