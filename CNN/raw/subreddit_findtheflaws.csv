10900245,0,t1_de47w5i,I like the idea of the long exposure trails for the train but I am not sure the execution is really doing it for me for a few reasons.First is the composition. The trails are off to the side yet stick out due to the colors and pull attention. They also serve as a leading line but dont lead you into the photo they kind of skirt the edge then just lead out of the frame.The other thing I am not a huge fan of is the choice of exposure. Its interesting that you did a long exposure here but it makes it kind of just look like daytime but with really flat kind of boring light. And the look of having trails during daytime is kind of throwing me off a bit.,findtheflaws,de4a6za,2,t5_3j18a

The problem is that it is so white and irregular in shape that it is drawing too much attention. If you think in terms of minimalism how much could you edit out of the image? ,findtheflaws,df7raml,1,t5_3j18a
