1116875,0,t3_24jq84,So Ive got the  cars now but how do I go about making them into a new  season? I have the  sorted out and can paste  cars into there such as driving the dogecar among  cars but how do I make a  series? Also there seems to be a lineup that essentially puts different cars from a series into one group such as the  BullRing having a BullRing drivers Ive never heard of manufacturer the  manufacturer gen  cars with manufacturer liveries and Jayski shows actual carsdrivers in the  season.How do I make a  leaguelineups? I tried copypasting the  GenBR folder renaming it  and pasting only  cars and removing the  liveries but when I open the series ingame none of the cars show up. How do I go about making my own series?EDIT I got it to work. Edited the series.lst files in the car folder in the  series folder and I had to rename the .dat in the series folder to the same name as the  folder,Nr2003,chv8yj9,2,t5_2u2sv
1177952,0,t1_ci1zrtx,At Martinsville I found that when braking it helps to let up for split second on entry. It seems to give the front end more grip then I lightly drag the brake through the corner. Getting the brake bias right also helps a lot.,Nr2003,ci251ah,1,t5_2u2sv

2648424,0,t1_cn428l9,yea I was around for portions of that and quite frankly its always been a problem in the Papyrus community. Whether it be who had the best paints or who was putting out mods or tracks there have always been issues. Even iRacing still has the same problems but now its more about who is elite i.e. DWC and who isnt. Same premise though.The exception seems to have been GPL which seems to have avoided all of the problems and kept its community together.,Nr2003,cn4a45p,1,t5_2u2sv

6113142,0,t3_3z8fl3,point of view...there was an excellent program called nr camhack by toca edit but it stopped being compatible after windows xp what it comes down to is editing the x y z coordinates in the makeacam file whichever series youre messing with ie cup cts etc.Theres a program called gpl grand prix legends camera control master that can edit this file. Then you have to get to the file itself to edit which is packed within the series dat file...Unpack the series dat with winmip and remove the makeacam file. Edit the file with gpl ccm and simply drop it into the series folder alongside the packed dat. Its a bitch because theres the small learning curve with unpacking the dat and ccm plus the trial and error with tweaking the coordinates right for your preferred view but it can be done with an hour or so set aside.,Nr2003,cyki24l,-1,t5_2u2sv

8138107,0,t3_4qnyck,I usually make subtle edits myself but ones that are still in the spirit of a sim. Stuff like removing pit road speeds and raising pace lap speeds. It makes the race pass quicker but isnt over the top in my opinion.To each their own.,Nr2003,d4ut4jy,2,t5_2u2sv

10340782,0,t1_dcg6ldg,Gotta point out once again that these are just Engine  Weight  Frontal Area and Drag prototypes. Everything else is kept stock NR for testing purposes and not to rush to far ahead. So all the differences between CTS PTA GNS on chassis and tires and aero and all that stuff are still present. So at the end these are about  still different chassis  with all different stock tires and other parameters  all different as they are in a stock game BUT every single one of those chassis on all  physics shares SAME engine profile same weight  same frontal area  and drag coefficient. This should make a decent  engine base to make some test runs and compare data. Raw values from online web sites so that has to be worked out to make sure those are real. ,Nr2003,dcg6q5i,1,t5_2u2sv
