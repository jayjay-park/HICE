7739723,0,t3_4l9ft8,Social seems theoretically traditionalist yet operationally liberal.Immigration and influence of foreign agents marks Nationalist maybe even ethnonationalist.Economics is like Trumps plan protectionist market school meaning you want protectionist policies yet dont want govt. to extend into economic measures further than necessary to ensure national industry remains dominant in the market though I dont want to put words in your mouth. In conclusion NationalConservative like the other person who posted here though I thought an analysis of why that is so might be welcome. ,WhatsMyIdeology,d3ly83k,1,t5_3eiil

I dont even understand how you can have such a viewpoint on these things and I know there are a great deal of people like me. What do you do with dissidents that are speaking out against your government like I would? Gulags? ,WhatsMyIdeology,dbiuewe,1,t5_3eiil

11009623,0,t3_5x6zq4,Your anticommmunism nationalism and authoritarianism put you in the fascist camp but you dont endorse keynesianism or a welfare state like most fascist ideologies. Your beliefs line up with Augusto Pinochet in terms of militarism capital punishment etc but he really didnt have a clear ideology.So i think Francoism is your best fit seeing how Franco also embraced the free market as part of the spanish miracle while still being commited to nationalism militarism etc.,WhatsMyIdeology,defwrwa,3,t5_3eiil
