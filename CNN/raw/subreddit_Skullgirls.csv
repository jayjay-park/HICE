Everybody else is a unique character that may take light inspiration from elsewhere e.g. Berserker Barrage Draugen Punch but the vast majority of each character is entirely original.Fukua is a joke about Decapre and recycling characters in general that has no drawn distinguishable characteristics between herself and Filia and is cobbled together out of Filias animations.Yes shes fully playable and shes got a new moveset all to her own.Shes still just a joke character and all the other characters are more than that.Im not slighting Lab Zero  they did a great job with Fukua.

1845668,0,t3_2fpg6p,I think Drag N Bite would have the same function as far as continuing combos but also would provide lockdown. You can easily throw out sLK or LK Giant Step to break their guard while Squigly is attacking. Squiglys cHP is also a good option trading lockdown time for sneaky low hits.BB and Squigly are definitely a solid team but they both have unique weaknesses so learn how to safely switch. Be sure to learn the DHC between Super Sonic Jazz and Squigly Battle Opera. Use LKMK version to make it safer when blocked or LKHK version to followup when it hits. For switching in the opposite direction Silver Chord into tag works just fine.,Skullgirls,ckblke2,2,t5_2t2fz
1911313,0,t3_2gioix,Fighting games are hard. Therefore there would be less casual gamers going into the genera. Smash is not really a d fighting game like SF or KOF and shit like that where the fights are more in your face and intense. Not saying smash v cant be intense but casuals playing smash have more options in playing the game. Not only that but Smash has not only the most popular gaming characters in it which appeals to more people of all ages but its is also .... how do I put it.... well im not gonna say that all casual gamers have triggers but there is always the first impression. Thats where Skullgirls comes in. First impression of Skullgirls will probably be THE BEAUTIFUL ART STYLE LIKE HOLY SHIT THIS  GAME IS SO SEXY I AM CRYING TEARS OF MAPLE SYRUP !!!!!!!!!!!! ltltltltltltlt Best case scenario. Worstgtgtgtgt ewwwwww Chinese cartoon girls with big boobs and panties and boobs and ewwwwwwwww.There is a big reason why when I play Skullgirls on the T.V. my family tends to leave the living room..... except for my little sis she plays SG too!!!! At least I can brawl with her anytime DUmm yah thats my opinion on why this game aint so popular from the Casual gamer.As for major fighting game tourny and shit... well I think it might have to  do with the small roster.

You sign up or just join if we specify if its open lobby beforehand and we pair you up with someone near your play level. Then when the stream starts you would join our steam chat and wed invite you to fight the guy we signed you up with. After that you and the other guy play  matches and I commentate on your play and both of you can improve. Our streams are published to Youtube and we encourage you to watch your matches to see what you can change on your play.If youre interested check out the FAQs thread in our steam group to learn more about times and such.Steam groupYoutube channelTwitch Channel,Skullgirls,cy7qe10,1,t5_2t2fz

6215180,0,t1_cyw0z23,So should I put a few hours into every character to learn common resets and junk? Or is it just a case of me not watching hard enough? With some characters I feel like watching for the reset and guessing wrong once is a dead character for example I fought a good Eliza who stuck me in the corner and used assists to extend and I only had like one guess after she opened me up. ,Skullgirls,cyw3kto,1,t5_2t2fz
6333596,0,t1_cz934oe,Yo I thought I was the only one! Octogates are so good for pad I dont know why they ever got rid of those bring em back pls. And those shoulder buttons are perfect for fighting games analog triggers on other pads only get in the way here. Its like this thing was designed for all the fighting games the Wii never had.Unfortunately though the Mayflash adapter I bought ended up being weird every now and then it sends some extra buttons I didnt press.

6381099,0,t1_czeq2a9,Also to take maximum advantage of it learn a simple infinite combo ignore IPS for a character youre playing and use that whenever it happens. Since the opponent cannot control the assist character stuck on the screen they cannot use burst even when your combo violates infinite prevention and thus you can outright kill the character even from full health with a simple looping infinite combo.,Skullgirls,czeyny7,2,t5_2t2fz

You need to respect that move so dont try to jump and air to air him. If theyre spamming it blocking it is just going to mean them doing it again so you have to DP them so they stop doing it. If they are spamming it once you hit them out of it a couple of times theyll most likely stop.,Skullgirls,czpilve,1,t5_2t2fz

Its no different than learning a Hero like Invoker Meepo Chen etc in Dota. Seems hard but if you practice a couple hours youll be busting out combos in no time.For instance within a few hours of practicing Double combos I was able to hit a  hit combo that used three specials and a blockbuster.Characters have very simple button rotations as well called chains.
