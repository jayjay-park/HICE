9377807,0,t3_590hyc,I wouldnt worry about it at all. I have a Galaxy Nexus Ive used every day for  years with an early AMOLED display before I got my Axon . And any burn in is barely noticeable even with software buttons. I can really only see it on solid backgrounds. It doesnt really affect anything else.Realistically you arent going to see much if any burn in by the  year mark the warranty expires at. It would not be covered under it as it is normal wear and tear that doesnt affect normal use.If you do plan on keeping the phone a long time and burn in is important to you Id recommend looking at another phone. But personally I think it is well worth the trade off.,Axon7,d94pbzz,5,t5_3etl7
9380071,0,t1_d94tdju,I went from a OPO to Axon  because OPO dropped on concrete and the screen wont work anymore...i might try to fix it and have a backup phone.Mostly i like the axon  only thing i dont like it seems to have a weaker cell reception than my OPO carrier is Ultra Mobile and using band  LTE i had pretty good LTE using my OPO at work but on my axon  couldnt get LTE at all using same carrier I didnt want to return it so i had to switch my sim setting to not use LTE using HSPAHSPA in order to get any datatexts.  At home theres no problem with LTE though with my axon ...so its something to think about. Apparently lots of people have this issue too also with TMobile i already have the B update..if your work area has bad signals you might want to reconsider.If you are into VR the axon  gave me a much better cardboard experience..with OPO my movie would tilt and move out of place after a few minutes but with axon  the sensorshead tracking seems very accurate .SD card is huge if you want to put movies on your card to watch in VR...one of the reason i didnt get the pixel XL  GB  GB was out of stock on like the nd day ... i know it wont have enough space to put VR games VR movies on a  Gb phoneafter formatting and OS probably only  GB left  and a typical  min movie is like  gb...if the pixel dont have a sd card slot theres no way  gb will be enough for me.  I put a  GB card in my axon  with  gb builtin so im pretty comfortable.,Axon7,d94zogv,2,t5_3etl7
