863226,0,t1_ch27h7u,gta Palatino that sucked horribly.Well thats a redundant statement if I ever heard one.  gtI guess it really comes down to how big the desire to play is.I think that this is whats truly different for different people and something Ive learned to take seriously. Are you a guy? Im guessing you are. In my experience men are great at finding garage sale instruments bashing away at them making all sorts of horrible sounds but sticking with it.  They dont care if they suck basically its all good. Women OTOH tend to assume that its them if the sounds are bad and even if they really truly yearn to play they do the right thing and get honest with themselves face up to the fact that theyre just not cut out to play fiddleviolin and should stop torturing everyone else in earshot.Its the same behavior you see when two people are confronted with a stuck door lock the guy will assume its just jammed and give the key a harder twist the woman will back off because maybe theres something she isnt doing right and she probably shouldnt force it and make it worse. Ive had so many people tell me stories of letting go of their dreams and after a while they weigh heavily. Im pretty protective of my students and want them to grow as fast as their work will take them.Im also lucky to have a great local luthier with a good stable full of nice rentals a generous renatappliedtopurchase policy and a deep selection of olderrestored and new instruments in the  range to choose from once the rental money has added up.If youve got a good luthier who maxes the setups on his instruments gets everything in the shop sounding its best no matter its humbleness and who charges a reasonable amount for his time it really is money well spent. ,Fiddle,ch2ek9o,2,t5_2qu5r

3428839,0,t1_cpj15gc,This seems pretty accurate to me. By that time some were still playing instruments without chin rests but I think for the s youd be fine using one. A standard Ebony rest should be fine. I second ditching the shoulder rest and you are correct in that during that time period German trade fiddles were still in common use and probably wouldve been the only thing most people could afford considering the Depression.,Fiddle,cpj43b5,2,t5_2qu5r

8650199,0,t1_d6mp4vd,On a tune like this some American fiddlers might go with an AEAE tuning.  Drone strings all over the place.,Fiddle,d6mvyso,1,t5_2qu5r
8834373,0,t1_d79ri0x,No its more like saying youd learn to race better in a basic slow car like a Miata that relies on momentum and a better understanding of the fundamentals than some advanced supercar with a computer that is highly refined and easy to drive. Once you master the Miata then the super car will be even better to drive.Kind of like how when you do learn to race a car they do start you out in a Miata or crappy little Skip Barber Its also common in guitar playing that learning on a cheaper guitar with higher action builds hand strength and is better for starting out than using the best money can buy.,Fiddle,d79rmz9,1,t5_2qu5r
10651256,0,t3_5sf71l,Its quite a bit more difficult. Ive played guitar since I was a kid and took up tenor banjo approximately  years ago. The transition from guitar to banjo was relatively seamless. Still have frets still use a pickplectrum. Im pretty good at the tenor banjo and lead a weekly Irish session at our local club. But I started learning fiddle a while ago and began focusing on it seriously five or six years ago and Im still pretty suckish. There are no frets you hold the thing under your chin which is weird the bow was completely foreign to me at first etc... big difference from other instruments in my opinion. That being said its also the most rewarding instrument to play and super fun. Id say go for it and start learning but do not expect quick results. Im still very much taking a long game approach and making progress slowly but making progress none the less. It helps to have recordings of yourself so that you can recognize your own progress. I know I still suck but I know I suck less now than I did two years ago because I have recordings I can refer to. Also having a teacher is invaluable. Watching videos and stuff is great but nothing beats sitting face to face with a great fiddle player and learning directly from them.,Fiddle,ddelfl5,2,t5_2qu5r
