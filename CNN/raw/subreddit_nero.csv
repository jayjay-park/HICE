Theyre coming to Austin City Limits which is about a four hour drive away with tickets that seem to cost a small fortune since its basically a festival.  Oh and they sold out of the tickets on the days Nero is showing up a while ago.  Neros only other show in Texas is in El Paso which is nearly a  hour drive for me.  Yeah Texas is that large.Guess I wont be catching them this time around!,nero,cuo2q8x,2,t5_2sng0
