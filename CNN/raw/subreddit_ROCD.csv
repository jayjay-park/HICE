4408002,0,t3_3bd5hq,This sounds exactly like me except that I am a male. Do you ever experience those brief moments where everything just feels right? Where you want to hug and hold your SO and tell them how much you love them while holding back the tears. These are the moments I try to remember when I go into a dark place.  Therapy has helped me immensely and I still get the homosexual intrusive thoughts but Ive learned to just leave them be. A few nights ago mid intercourse I got the thought I was having sex with a buddy of mine boy was that an erection killer. But instead of freaking out and wondering why I thought that I just let it be. The brain is a unique and somewhat a pain in the ass thought generator.  We have to be ok with uncertainty. We have to accept that there is a chance that in few years we do find out we are homosexual.   Start watching tv shows with your SO that are filled with homosexualtrans behavior. It is great therapy. I watched Transparent with my girlfriend and those few episodes were really hard to watch. After a few more episodes it just didnt make me anxious anymore it was very freeing!   I hope you have a SO whom understands and you are open about this with. Being able to tell my girlfriend all the things that are in my head has been very freeing. I no longer have to keep it all locked up in fear that it may be true. The homosexual doubts talk can be a very odd discussion. I remember my girlfriend saying well its ok to be gay when I had my first episode in front her. She probably thought I was gay at the time who wouldnt? But now that she knows I have OCD and that is one of my obsessions she understands it all. ,ROCD,csmilug,3,t5_2v9s2

5298076,0,t3_3nhnhg,You have to stop struggling with the thoughts and just let them go. Its very difficult but the more you dwell on these things the harder it will be. You cannot fix your obsession. Check out our wiki theres some more information there you can look at. You shouldnt be trying to treat your disorder entirely on your own if you have a specialist it makes it so much easier!Anyways hang in there. ROCD is horribly painful. I personally think its one of the worst types of obsessions to deal with. It took me a long time to be treated and theres still things that bother me.,ROCD,cvow2cb,1,t5_2v9s2

6531290,0,t1_czuv6oo,Well... it doesnt have to be a general thing it could be for specific situations. Im mainly referring to that feeling you get when youre obsessing. So if you feel guilty like you need to confess or you feel weak... you realize this is happening and take control. Remember to not let it become something you obsess about. Its something there to make therapy easier. If its making it more difficult its not useful for you.Also you can set aside all your major relationship decisions until youre treated. This way you dont have to worry about making any decisions to leave. Set this aside and carry on with your relationship no matter what feelings you think you have.,ROCD,czuvy00,2,t5_2v9s2

6897313,0,t1_d0xl4oa,I blogged about it just now prompted partly by your post! So heres a link to the whole thing and heres the relevant bit. Its focused on a slightly different topic but it does include the bit where I always nebulously feel like something is wrong.Edit To make it a little more relevant I think the ridiculous conclusions I come to based on I feel a little uneasy show that the OCDresponse to the unease is way more of a problem than the feeling of unease! And it illustrates how our brains can get so far from reality based on something really not problematic at all.gt Partner doesnt love me any more but isnt telling me for reasongtgt This one is hella annoying.gt gt In relationships I have a constant unconscious feeling that something is off. Somethings wrong and I cant put my finger on it.gt gt In reality I probably feel like something is off in a relationship because I cant understand why or how anyone could want me. And thats a whole other story. But its so easy to forget that this is an unhealthy feeling that I learned in childhood and when I forget that I start to look for reasons why something feels off. Pair obsession that something is wrong compulsion to find out what.gt gt On a good day the compulsion to find out what will turn into a compulsion to seek reassurance. Ill ask totally out of the blue if she still loves me.gt gt On a bad day I dont want to expose this insecurity to anyone so I just keep looking internally. Maybe something feels off because she doesnt love me. But then she would tell me right? Not if she was about to break up with me and it was easier to just do it all in one go.gt gt I know I know that this is very unlikely. But I start looking for signs that Ive done something to hurt her. A few days ago I asked her about something even though I should have known that me asking would make her uncomfortable. Its probably stuff like that  hundreds of small insensitivities building up and up until she would just have a better life without me.gt gt This thought gets stuck. She doesnt love me its because I did something wrong and theres nothing I can do. I feel like if I knew for sure that would help because this limbo of not being sure is agonising. And then if I knew what it was I could refrain from doing it again. So I ask. Did I say something that upset you? Am I being annoying? Its seeking reassurance again.gt gt Pair obsession that she doesnt love me compulsion to find out what I did wrong.gt gt It even feeds itself  I am often totally convinced that my seeking reassurance is enormously awful for her.gt gt These days its kicking my ass from the other side. I asked her if she still loved me and she said yes but shes lying to save my feelings because this OCD thing makes it look like I would be So Extremely Devastated if she broke up with me.gt gt And thats the thing. Like with the other obsessive thoughts theyre not actually related to how much I would hurt if the thing happened. Theyre not even related to my feelings about the thing at all. I am not actually terrified that she will break up with me just a normal amount of wow that would be awful and if it happened I could deal. I am just totally obsessed and often even convinced of something that happens to be a very undesirable potential event. Its intense and very uncomfortable and sometimes painful and the compulsion brings a little relief.,ROCD,d0y4ndr,1,t5_2v9s2

7351925,0,t3_4fwfpy,Accepting uncertainty is not enough to treat OCD there is much more to do such as resisting compulsions.

Accept all these annoying feelings and if you can tell your bf about it it might help but dont let him give you reassurance just let it out. I write all my obsessions down to keep track to whats bothering me and realize how one day when I read them all I tell myself Omg are you stupid? and after couple of days Id read them and be like Omg this is so real thats how ocd is. ,ROCD,d7qea0v,1,t5_2v9s2
9068381,0,t1_d813wjh,I guess. These thoughts really do get amplified with OCD. The thing is i should be proud of him. but i get anxiety at the thought of marrying him even though we are both young  and I feel like it shouldnt be like that. My mind always argues back that Im just emotionally dependent I always want to talk to him see him be with him always. But then I get these terrible feelings so my only explanation is that Im just in love with the idea of him and that Im too insecure to be without him. Great right?,ROCD,d81vfce,1,t5_2v9s2

9748787,0,t3_5edp9j,No its not good advice at all. Fearing the thoughts is the core reason you obsess. Considering they dont understand even the very basics of treatment I highly recommend seeking another therapist. Look for someone who teaches ERP. In order for a therapist to understand how to treat OCD they have to specifically study OCD treatment. This is the type you want to look for. Ask them questions when looking dont be afraid! What makes you qualified to treat OCD? Youre the one paying them. Youre their customer. Dont think of doctors as gods you must come into treatment with an open mind both ways they could know what theyre doing they could give bad advice well see! Its good that you are questioning this! Thats the only way youll find decent advice! Always making sure its right.,ROCD,daer0xd,1,t5_2v9s2

Your mother should not dictate your treatment leave her out of it this is for you and the therapist to work out. If you are worried about your mother interfering you can mention that to the therapist and they might have recommendations of how to handle her.

10279368,0,t1_dc918bb,Oh ok. Yeah the fact that youve started your journey in getting better is awesome allready . But it does sound quite lazy meds are a cosmetic fix it doesnt go to the root of the problem.Since the goal is to get you feeling better its important to get the right kind of help and be knowledgable because not all therapists know what to do. A lot of the times it takes some insisting on our part.Hope the meds help alleviate some of the anxiety soon ,ROCD,dc980xl,1,t5_2v9s2

11066389,0,t1_dem05fy,ucby while mindfulness is a very useful tool and it definitely can make OCD treatments easier to apply it in itself is not a treatment for OCD. Headspace is a great app but it is important that it is not relied on solely for OCD treatment. As stated in the sidebar ERP is the treatment used by experts and scientifically proven. udantstheman you are performing compulsions by ruminating trying to figure out the thoughts why they happen what they mean etc. and by feeling checking saying you feel calm at the idea of not loving her and anxious when you think you do love her. These behaviours will continue to allow OCD to have a great effect on you. You must learn to stop interacting with the thoughts. As for wanting to break up just know that if you end the relationship before you learn to manage OCD then you will have to learn how to manage the OCD when it comes back. Considering how painful rOCD is I would suggest starting treatment as soon as possible. ,ROCD,demd52l,1,t5_2v9s2

11115961,0,t3_5yp19l,Cant help you with any other disorders but if he does have OCD and his obsessions involve your relationship then this whole breakup thing is not surprising if he does not know how to manage his disorder. You can search this sub and you will find many situations where people obsess about whether they should stay in their relationship or not. Everyone is encouraged to not make any such decisions because in an obsessive state of mind something like your situation can happen and people can be left confused and hurt. He has to treat his OCD using a kind of therapy called CBT specifically ERP When you see therapy you might think of talk therapy but CBT is different. Treating OCD involves consistently resisting compulsions. Reassurance is an example compulsion. He feels like he has to have it and will seek it over and over again. It gives only temporary relief and he will obsessively seek it for that relief. This has to be resisted no matter how difficult it is. Overtime as he continually eliminates his obsessive behavior his brain will get used to it and he will gradually feel better.Since OCD is only treated through behavioral changes if he does not change his behavior he will continue to suffer with the disorder. If he does not get help or attempt to learn the therapy on his own his disorder will continue to hurt him and anyone around him. Its up to you if you want to continue to hold on to him and all of this abusive drama. You can try your best to introduce him to ERP but if he thinks its unmanly or instantly denies it theres not much you can really do! It would be a bad decision to stay with him if he does not work hard towards treatment as what you are experiencing will be never ending. If he does work hard it could be worth it if the relationship is really important to you.,ROCD,derzgtl,3,t5_2v9s2

11586215,0,t1_dg84zn2,Ah that makes tons of sense. I looked up the therapist on the companys website and she specializes in relationship issues and self confidence issues and stuff. My mom chose her for me haha. She didnt mention OCD one single time in our appointment but I think its pretty clear I have some form of it. But if shes not trained in that realm I could see why she didnt pick up on it. Its a really large company I mean they treat everything like I went there for ADHD testing a couple years ago and it was really a great self discovery experience. So I bet theyll have an OCD specialist. If not one of my best friends has OCD so I can ask her where she goes. ,ROCD,dg9azbz,1,t5_2v9s2
