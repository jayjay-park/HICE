263711,0,t1_cf7jw8a,its more reversible than a vasectomy. also since youre not cutting off flow you wont get backed up like you would with a vasectomy. you should ask your doctor about it. i doubt hed recommend it as its not currently legal in the US but theyve been doing it for  years in india. do your own research ask questions and maybe take a little vacation to india...edit they are working on bringing it to the US. should be soon. but if you need something now just get a vasectomy.,RioGrandeValley,cf83cxf,1,t5_2r6hv

3151490,0,t1_coohd6k,The numbers of fraud are actually super small is just another excuse to get people to argue with each other. Despite record growth in food stamp enrollment during the Great Recession twothirds of states saw payment error rates decrease during the downturn. Nationwide error rates are at alltime lows saving the program billions of dollars.Most people concentrate on getting pissed off about a couple people gaming the system but forget about all those who benefit and the lives it saves. While I also get a bit upset when I see people abusing the system I still think this type of programs are necessary. Allegations of fraud including an informal economy in which food stamps are turned into cash or used to buy liquor gasoline or other items besides food have been used to argue that the program is out of control. In fact the black market accounts for just over  percent of the total food stamp program which is far less than fraud in other government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.,RioGrandeValley,coondxa,-1,t5_2r6hv
