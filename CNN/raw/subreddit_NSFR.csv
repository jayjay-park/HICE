1052281,0,t3_25ya1h,. PVP. Medium to large size guild sounds like it would work best with warplotsendgame pve.  Though we should definitely have some sort of minimum activity requirement. If people are staying logged out for long periods of time ex.  days without letting the leaders know of a valid reason their absence then they should be kicked to make room for more active players.. Recruit people at or close to max level. BGs Dungeons and grouping  with the people from our server will be important if this is how we are going to recruit.  We should probably refrain from advertising for guild recruits in all chat.. Likely going spellslingerRDPS. Raiding will be how I spend most of my time ingame once I hit max level. I like the idea of having a raid scheduled for weekends but should be pretty flexible during the week. Im in the EDT timezone so if we schedule raids late at night for all you PDT folks my sleep schedule could start getting pretty wonky!. Already preordered. Waiting for the headstart to kick in.,NSFR,chnwdkn,2,t5_2ru9t
1062649,0,t3_267lev,Ill probably end up playing a stalker. I really like how the class functions plus Ive never actually played a Stealth class for more than a quarter of a raid tier but it was ICC so like one regular raid tier. I was also looking at Medic as a DPS class it looked kind of cool. DPS engineers looked kind of cool as well. So do spellslingers.As for Warplots Im not quite sure what they are. BGs? Id be willing to try them out but my primary focus would be Raids. The game doesnt look terrible for alts either so thatll probably my secondary focus.,NSFR,chp2tag,1,t5_2ru9t
