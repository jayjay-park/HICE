1144813,0,t3_2785ch,Palmers Coco ButterIve had super dry skin on my legs where if you looked closely it looked like cracked desert dirt. I dont know how I came about choosing to try Coco Butter but at this point I dont really care. It works! Ive been using it everyday after a shower and my legs look so moisturized! I know all of our skins react differently but it never hurts to try.  You can find this lotion in Target or WalMart.The bottle looks like this And they they have a fragrance free option if you dont want to walk around smelling like a chocolate bar. ,NaturalBeauty,chyej8q,1,t5_2s4dv

1627397,0,t1_cjexryf,Sorry for the delay. Im healing up from a shunt surgery. Anyway hyaluronic acid sounds like it wouldnt be moisturizing but it is. We naturally make hyaluronic acid and it is found in skin joints etc. It draws moisture into your skin so it is great to put on after a shower and before moisturizer. I wouldnt normally link to Dr. Oz but this may help.,NaturalBeauty,cjkar3w,1,t5_2s4dv

3598536,0,t1_cq1nsqo,I dont have a medical diagnosis  Ive looked into local dermatologists but Ive heard horror stories and most of them seem to heavily promote all kinds of cosmetic laser stuff and Im sure they would probably try to sell me their services or promote some prescription meds or creams. That doesnt mean I wont eventually get it checked out by a professional if need be. As for the nutrition stuff...Im not an expert by any means but everyone and their mom seems to have a different opinion about whats good and whats bad no disrespect intended at all!. It can get pretty confusing and Ive tried my share of eating regimens. W really has done wonders for me. I feel so much better and dont have near the number of mood swings or depressive episodes I struggled with before. Plus Ive lost a lot of weight without feeling like Im starving missing out or wanting to kill everyone that speaks to me But in my experience it comes down to what works for you. Cutting out grains for me has completely gotten rid of all of my gastrointestinal problems. Gone. Huge relief considering I had assumed I would have to live with daily stomach aches and carry around tums in my purse forever. Youre very possibly right though about me missing something from my diet though and Ive thought about it for sure. I try to get plenty of green leafy veg nuts nut oils etc. However I dont have the time or energy to count my macros and really analyze my diet that way. It may sound lazy I dont know...Also just to play devils advocate I feel like diets such as Paleo and W are probably much more balanced than the diets of most of the people I know who dont give a shit about what they eat. I could be wrong though. Its super hard to figure out your ideal balance when it comes to healthful eating. sighAnyway sorry for the wall of text! Thanks for your input its given me some things to consider ,NaturalBeauty,cq2gjq5,2,t5_2s4dv
3634892,0,t3_31w8i7,Ive been using Morocco Method shampoos with good results. They are made with herbs and do not lather. The closest thing to a soap ingredient is soap bark but the shampoos really do get your hair clean and shiny. They are quite expensive but if you want a natural soapdetergentfree alternative give these a try! I usually water mine down a bit and use a widetooth comb in the shower to distribute the product. Otherwise some of my hair stays oily. ,NaturalBeauty,cq6lsvh,3,t5_2s4dv
4244861,0,t3_39jtst,Surprisingly enough coconut oil seemed to work the best out of everything I have tried. Its helped me tremendously with discolored elbows and knees both in color and texture.

4592392,0,t3_3dw52w,I tend to focus more on humectants and occlusives in the summer. Try moisturizing with diluted glycerin maybe diluted with rosewater? and possibly using an organic facial lotionoil sunscreen with nonnano zinc since you both need sun protection and the zinc acts as an occlusive to seal in the moisture ,NaturalBeauty,ct9gr1z,3,t5_2s4dv
4621960,0,t3_3dw52w,Mayba Babassu? Its quite similar to coconut oil but it is not comodogenic and nice for sensitive skin. I tried sweet almoind oil aswell and think its quite heavy like shea butter.Did you try Hydrosoles as extra moisturizer under oil? This has also a nice and moisturizing effect. I also like to put some hyaluronic acid in mine as extra moisturizer.,NaturalBeauty,ctd68tj,1,t5_2s4dv

10181709,0,t3_5lim74,For budget I would say Rainwater Botanicals CC Cream is great. Its light but does give a nice coverage of redness. If you want something more full coverage Alima Pure Satin Matte Foundation is also awesome. More pricey foundations that I love are Hynt Beauty Concealer  I blend it with some face oil to thin it out and its an amazing full coverage foundation  OR my personal favorite Gressa Serum Foundation which has tons of plant ingredients in it that help acne prone skin heal. ,NaturalBeauty,dby5iv3,2,t5_2s4dv
