5987589,0,t1_cy4huli,Man thatll be confusing when actually reach August  and wonder when you took these pictures haha. Soon Ill add an import view so at least youll be able to see them in the order they were imported and you wont get mixed up as much. Skipping months sounds like a better idea but I need to figure out a good way to mark the discontinuity. Maybe Ill just collapse them down to one bin each so you still see the alternating darklight. ,Filmulator,cy4i5y6,1,t5_3ath4
