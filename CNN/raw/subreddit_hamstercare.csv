Other than weekly cage cleaning you may want to spot clean out the bathroom area or wipe down the wheel every few days. When youre cleaning the cage a lot of people recommend putting them in a ball. Personally I lay out a towel and some toys in a bathtub and put the hammy in there while I clean the cage. You could use a bin with a bit of bedding in it or a playpen similarly. Always make sure you keep an eye on them while theyre out of their cage!Hamster Hideout and The Pipsqueakery are some good resources to read up on various hamster things.,hamstercare,d4mefj0,1,t5_35rep
