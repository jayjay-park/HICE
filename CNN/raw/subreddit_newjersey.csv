The NJ senators were talking about a bill to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill Feinstein was talking about semi automatic rifles not all guns. Even when it comes to sensible regulations like background checks training for CCW permits and bans on military style hardware gun owners freak out. There is no debate because theyre all absolutists theyre completely intractable and totally unreasonable. To them there is no middle ground no such thing as a sensible gun regulation. Its black and white all gun regulations are bad period. You cant debate people like that because theyre true believers theyre fanatics zealots.

Some collapsed some underground. There are concrete stables and a Church. Its hauntingly fascinating. Its a military instillation of sorts I read on an old geocities page that it was built during the time we entered WW and Woodrow Wilson ordered a bunch of training facilities. Tweed was built and never completed for mountain training.

652751,0,t1_cge7cv1,Sort of. Heres an excerpt from the wikipedia page . Basically it hits really quickly because you inject it.gt Diacetylmorphine almost always still called by its original trade name of heroin in nonmedical settings is used as a recreational drug for the transcendent relaxation and intense euphoria it induces. Anthropologist Michael Agar once described heroin as the perfect whatever drug. Tolerance develops quickly and users need more of the drug to achieve the same effects. Its popularity with recreational drug users compared to morphine reportedly stems from its perceived different effects. In particular users report an intense rush an acute transcendent state of euphoria which occurs while diacetylmorphine is being metabolized into monoacetylmorphine MAM and morphine in the brain. Some believe that heroin produces more euphoria than other opioids upon injection one possible explanation is the presence of monoacetylmorphine a metabolite unique to heroin  although a more likely explanation is the rapidity of onset. While other opioids of recreational use produce only morphine heroin also leaves MAM also a psychoactive metabolite. However this perception is not supported by the results of clinical studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of injected heroin and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opioids these subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent injected doses had comparable action courses with no difference in subjects selfrated feelings of euphoria ambition nervousness relaxation drowsiness or sleepiness.,newjersey,cgeguay,1,t5_2qhsu

Yes it would safer if I never let my kids outside too.

Marina casinos really dont allow for that. Sure theres the Jitney but the Boardwalk is super walkable. Then I thought Really every remaining casino has a top draw the others didnt. Starting from to south going northTropicana  the Quarter. HUGE draw never a reason to leave. Has something for everyone. Plus Hooters Firewaters ampamp now Chickie ampamp Petes on the Boardwalk.Caesars  actually I never hang out here but their rooms are more expensive than most I think they cater to a different crowd. Dusk is one of the better clubs. Ballys  Harrys Oyster Bar. Harrys might be my favorite place in AC. Ballys amp Caesars also both have prime locations. Trump Plaza had location but nothing much else to offer.Resorts  oldest casino in AC. Saved by Margaritaville ampamp Landshark. Super overrated but they draw in the Baby Boomer Parrotheads a loyal customer base. Terrible beers on tap. Borgota  Really the class of AC. No one can touch them. They even fought to only hire good looking waitresses and won. Image matters.Harrahs  Has the Pool and not much else IMHO. But that Pool is a consistent draw day AND night. I even got married there. Golden Nugget  This would be the next one on my endangered list but it has the HO Pool ampamp a cool deck with the nearby Marina crowd. Lots of boat people. The other casinos that closed the two Trumps really didnt offer a star attraction. Showboat didnt and had bad location. Atlantic Club other side of Showboat. Revel had things but was likely doomed from the start. You need a distinct cool identity to survive in AC now it seems. ,newjersey,ckdvdep,4,t5_2qhsu

2937001,0,t3_2tpx9b,Its a great idea but the problem with it is who pays for it? What I mean is if a company chooses to stay open during a state of emergency they probably believe they will make more money than they spend on the pay for the employees. So who pays for the part time full time and salaried employees? Someone will somewhere. If you make the businesses the government would be forcing a business to pay employees when they are forced to not make money. This could cause larger businesses to move states to keep earning profit. If its the government then youre forcing the state to budget for the entire states wages for a day or two per year. Then it becomes a politically charged issue. If its no one I could see an increase of people who need food stamps and an increase of people leaving to find more stable jobs.This is in addition to heaps of other problems.  Such as where will people buy milk and bread when all the grocery stores are forced to close? What happens to truck drivers who are driving through the state? Will they be fined for working during a state of emergency?I agree that something must be done I hated working retail and driving to work during a blizzard only to sell to other mall workers forced to go to work that day.

Appointed corrupt leaders to Port Authority who received bribes in the form of services  the flights to a summer home.  Obstructed justice and deleted text messages linking him with Bridgegate.  Lied about Bridgegate and still lies to this day.  Breaking our laws on abortion and medical marijuana so he can look presidential to people who dont live here.  Didnt report or pay taxes on his annual k personal slush fund.  Didnt pay for state issued services like flying around in the governors helicopter until he got caught.  And now I strongly believe taxpayers are paying his campaign bills at least insofar as his bodyguards accommodations and travel expenses.  He admitted to that in a QA session.Recall him now.

4402553,0,t3_3bg7lc,Urewardiflost got everything right in his post.  As far as a real serial killer investigation goes there are a couple of different scenarios in NJ because almost every one of the  municipalities have their own police departments  yes there are some with  cops total .  The murders all happen in one town.  Local detectives and County Prosecutor detectives will investigate the individual murders as team.  When they suspectdetermine multiple murders are connected they will get additional help from the State Police and possibly the FBI.  Cops from other towns and county agencies may be called in to help and a Task Force of cops from all over may be created.  State Attorney Generals office which oversees each of the  municipal County Prosecutors offices may eventually get involved in the prosecution once a suspect is identified and arrested.  US Marshalls may be used to locate and arrest the suspect once they have been identified and an arrest warrant has been issued.   The murders happen in different towns.  Again  municipal detectives and County Prosecutors detectives will investigate each murder as a team.  Once they suspectdetermine a connection between multiple murders the same thing as above happens and its almost guaranteed that a task force well be formed with cops from each town involved.  However  if the different towns are in different counties  that means different County Prosecutors so the State Attorney Generals office will likely take over the investigation. There will be a much higher likelihood that the State Police FBI US Marshals  etc ...will be involved.  Hope that helps. ,newjersey,cslwi2w,2,t5_2qhsu

A press pass might work if youve got cameras with you and are just documenting. There isnt much excuse for any workers to be at these places at night so even the old hivis vest trick wont work. Best bet if caught is to explain you were trying to get pictures for a story and were not there to harm anything. If you have no record or one or two minor things on there you wont be charged most likely just told to go home. Some exceptions apply.First Greystone is mostly gone. The only thing that I think is still there is the original central element of the Kirkbride building. I drive by within  minutes of that place every day Ill check it out. Either way going there at night was a bad idea they had their own police on the grounds. You could drive through in the day stop take some pictures that was it. Ill drive by and report back tomrrow but dont get your hopes up. Obviously as recently was discussed every scary road is just a long empty road in wooded or rural areas that people in suburbs are not used to seeing. Clinton Rd. and Shades of Death Rd. instantly spring to mind. One in the woods and one rural both share legends and both are just long stretches of road with not much on them. That said Split Rock Rd. and the area around it give off an odd vibe. We once went offroading in the woods there and found about  appliances with shotgun blasts all over them. Green Pond Rd to Upper Hibernia Rd to Split Rock Rd. No idea if the old school in Lambertville is still up but that was a popular one though again not legal at all. Slaughterhouse is long gone same with Marys Tower. Oh in Ringwood State Park apparently one of the most haunted places in NJ or some shit there is a small twostory house sort of in the middle of the path cant miss it Back and to the right. There is a house there looks like it hasnt been touched since the ss save for one closet that has perfectly redone wood floors and walls. Its not exactly legal but Ive been there twice. Odds of getting caught are slim at best. Took a bunch of photos couldnt really get upstairs and do not go into the basement I took one gentle step and felt the old ass wood stairs bend. Probably the closest youre going to get for an abandoned place without risking arrest. If you wanna drive a few hours Centralia Silent Hill movies not games in PA is sorta strange. Weird seeing a clear road layout and plots of land but no houses. Go when its a bit colder and with the gasses steam also rises from the cracks in the ground and mountain. Also the abandoned section of highway is pretty strange. Not scary at all just off. Anything you read in WeirdNJ is already known and patrolled so youre best off looking for stuff online. Hell go to google earth and just look for long empty roads in Warren Salem or Cape May counties. Sussex too. Youll get more of a thrill just going somewhere new than youll get from most places you can legally go. I mean there is always a bit of risk it just depends on how great the risk and if youre willing to accept possible arrest the actual charge isnt awful and generally amounts to a bit of probation and a fine  you can widen your search. Centralia is unique because it was a town that was bought out so technically public land. The Vortex in Wanaque has some truth to it. The area is an area of unusually strong electromagnetism so back in the day it would fuck with cell phones and digital cameras and make shit come out looking strange but thats all it was. Pretty cool being at the base of a super tall highway bridge though. ,newjersey,cwfpz2j,3,t5_2qhsu

These kids cant see the forest for the trees. If we cant accept that great people can be human and have flaws then we are going to be renaming lots of a monuments.  Perhaps we should start with renaming the Washington Monument because he was the first president to be obtuse when speaking about and owning black people.Since this is a civil rights issue lets talk about Gandhi the guy that influenced civil disobedience in the US. Guess what he spoke poorly of black people too. Guess every statue of Gandhi is now a dual tribute to civil liberties and casual racism. We could go on ad nauseam and probably find a contemporary reason to remove and rename every single monument in the United states if we dug hard enough.Its not my job to tell them not to be offended but its my right to tell them that its not societies job to protect you from selfperceived insults.,newjersey,cxain9h,8,t5_2qhsu

If one service was negatively impacting the availability of a bigger priority there might be an argument for it though Im not sold on the idea that feral cats dont deserve care as much as owned cats.

I cooperated with the police and they strongly hinted that if I help them with some other matters then they could make the charge go away.  I did help them and when I called to verify my court date I was told that the case had been thrown out. So that was the end of that.  Now Im going to interview later this year for a nongovernmentnonlaw enforcement job that pays more than k.  I mention this figure because thats the threshold for being able to look at peoples arrest record in addition to their criminal background.  So not wanting this arrest to show up I tried to pull my records from the state using this approach to see if the arrest was on there and if it was my plan was to move forward with getting those records expunged.  The report came back completely clean somewhat to my surprise.  So my question is  Did I pull the correct record? If I did have an arrest record out there would it have shown up on this background check?   are there any other places to check to make sure that this nasty bit of my past doesnt pop up in any other background checks?  ,newjersey,d0wvub0,5,t5_2qhsu

7886310,0,t3_4nb3zt,None of the articles I found bothered to link to the actual decision so here you go direct linkDecision was .Reading over the decision its kind of interesting. The opinion is that yes the legislature intended to make COLAs a contractual obligation. However the state doesnt have the authority to make binding any debt that exceeds  of the budget without first getting a majority of NJ voters to approve that expense via a referendum. This is the debt limitation clause of the Constitution. gt ...The Court does not question the good intentions of those participating in the enactmentof Chapter  or that they intended to create a contractual arrangement to address future payment... But a strictly legal question is before the CourtThe unions argument was that this debt limitation clause shouldnt apply because they viewed the COLAs as unpaid ordinary expenses rather than newlycreated debt. The court said no the language of the clause is broad and covers liabilities created in any manner and the Clause is clearly intended to limit how much the state could promise to pay at one time in future budget years. The opinion made sure to note that the COLA is not part of the pension payment a worker directly earns based on the compensation formula salary and time spent. That separation seemed to be key in this.TLDR The fact that the COLA is a separate additional payment apart from the core pension payment made it an additional future liability which was too large over  of the budget to constitutionally make legally binding. ,newjersey,d42hsrw,3,t5_2qhsu

Mass Casualty does not mean is has to include fatalities but it means usually  or more people in one incident have been hurt or killed. Yes a bad car accident can be labeled a mass casualty as well as . Why calling this an MCI is important? It helps with logistics. It allows for all first responders and such to get to defined areas and such and make best the resources available. It sets up staging areas and allows for the best usage of resources and man power to help those who need the most help first and such. You may see on tv and movies black tags red tags yellow tags etc. The NTSB and DOT are coming to investigate.Those injured are being sent according to tv news to Jersey City Medical Christ Hospital Hoboken University Medical Center Bayonne Hospital UMDMJ Newark. Please note the only trauma one hospital is UMDMJ Newark. If the person is sent there their injuries are likely life threatening. Jersey City Medical Center is the only Trauma  on the list so they most likely have more severe cases.Here is a explaination of trauma centers For anyone wanting to help I suggest that you become a regular blood donor but if you can a platelet donor. Just note that if you donate today it most likely will not help anyone injured today because it takes a day or more to process and test the blood. That is why it is important that you become a regular blood or platelet donor because events like these are unforeseen and if the system has a regular supply of blood and platelet donors then they wont be overwhelmed. If I recall correctly a lot of the blood donations taken after  were thrown out because they could not store all of it properly. Sadly for a lot of donors it was also their first and only time they donated.Here are some facts about blood donations.  Red cells last for  days platelets last for  days and plasma can be frozen for up to a year more can be seen here I donate platelets and have done so on a routine basis. platelets are  arguably more important than red blood cells because platelets help clot the wound as transfusing blood does no help if it leaks right out. Platelets have been found so useful in traumatic injuries that the military now transfuses blood and platelets in a one to one ratio. If you want to donate you should check these two reputable places,newjersey,d870bxv,1,t5_2qhsu

11352486,0,t1_dfhwrzu,Exactly! My fiancee is willing to take on the financial responsibilities but since were moving from across the country we dont have any jobs lined up! Unless she can find a solid job that starts immediately itd be a scary first couple of months.Thanks for the insight into Paterson... It definitely does not come highly recommended! Someone else pointed out that a lot of places will likely open up in a few months after WPU graduation so hopefully wed have more options then.I did the math on the stipend and with the amount of work theyre asking me to do it works out to barely hour  less than minimum wage! Obviously the full ride is generous but I gotta pay the bills too! I dont know how complex the bureaucracy is but maybe theyll come through with more money...Again thanks for all your help!PS my fiancee loves looking at your rabbits ,newjersey,dfis7hi,1,t5_2qhsu
