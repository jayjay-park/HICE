1945737,0,t3_2gww8j,I had that problem too. Its most likely your coil. I had a rebuildable one and it was shorting out and would reset the MVP. If your using a prebuilt could you might want to swap it. Thats the easiest potential culprit. It could also be a bad  connection on the atomizer that drops or raises the ohms and messes with the regulation so it resets. If you have a different tankatomizer give it a shot and see if that changes. It could be the pin on the  connection on the MVP. Those have an issue with getting pushed down and messing up the connection. Use a toothpick or something to wiggle it up and that might be all you need. I had a Kayfun that would push the  down on the MVP and give it fits. It could be a short on the device. I guess setting both at max might be an issue but I doubt it really. That was usually from a short or something that screwed up the ohm reading while it was firing. ,Innokin,cknnvuc,2,t5_2xrpx

3134314,0,t3_2w1c3r,This is either a failsafe for a short or for the resistance changing drastically during firing as far as I can tell. I was having the same problem with my Subtank Mini but only with the RBA base. Figured out there was poor connection between the RBA positive pin and the pin on the Subtank base itself which was causing the resistance to jump all over the damn place. Im assuming that one of the jumps happened while test firing and the MVP just shuts down to stop it from trying to draw to many amps or something to that effect. ,Innokin,comvaq2,1,t5_2xrpx

3507762,0,t1_cps2iym,Thats if youre comparing it on wattage. I generally compare my devices on functionalityprice in comparison to what I enjoy. If I were presented with the both devices and had to choose Id probably choose the Istick w. With that being said I own both the MVP and MVP . Well the wife does and I think they are both solid devices. I would have liked to see the MVP . push up to W as thats where Ive seen most vapers stop at in terms of wattage but overall its retained the solid build quality I liked with the MVP.,Innokin,cps3yu1,1,t5_2xrpx

7687806,0,t1_d3fx30j,Are you using SS coils though? Because the resistance of those does change quite a bit as you use them. My . SS coil will read . at room temperature and as high as . I think just after a vape. My ecig theory is that pressing the  button just keeps the screen alive which allows the user to see the resistance value updating whereas typical use shows the recentlyread ohm value on the screen then it goes dark. ,Innokin,d3g1zxf,1,t5_2xrpx
8070031,0,t1_d4mgl0b,Always double check Innokin products with the builtin code which Im glad you did. A lot of people just check the code on the box and leave it at that not realising that theres folks out there pulling the ol switcheroo with genuine items and putting in clones or just reusing unscratched boxes.
