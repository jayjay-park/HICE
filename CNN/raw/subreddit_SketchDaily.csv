237062,0,t3_1wso9d,I dont know what this thing is. I call him Frank.My resolution was to draw more and incorporate my own characters into the themes. Thing is... I dont think I really have the visual library to do so. I need more studies ever since I tried this resolution I feel like Ive been drawing less and less... even though I havent. I draw as long as before just... it takes time to get my ideas down on the canvas. So I think Ill just stick to the first part of my resolution which is drawing more and do more studies until I feel like I can tackle this situation properly. Of course Ill throw my characters in when I feel I can do so. dPhew. Long ass text. Love all yall btw you people are great so keep up the great work. lt,SketchDaily,cf5bktd,8,t5_2sf6f

267202,0,t1_cf864la,It is very odd at first at least if youre using a drawing tablet like a wacom because you arent looking at your hands as you draw. On more computery tablets like ipads and stuff you wont have that problem but Ive personally noticed a bit of input lag might just be specific to my experiences though. This weirdness passes pretty quick though its kinda like playing video games or maybe typing by feel just becomes natural. The human brain is cool like that. That said the benefits of digital are immense and countless I dont really draw traditionally at all anymore because of this. Aside from being plain awesome its also becoming more of the industry standard in terms of making art for a said purpose dont get me wrong everybody wants some nice handcrafted traditional art up on their wall but photoshop is king among jobs in advertising and concept art.    Also duuuude erasers are very valuable tools! You should definitely track down a good eraser I personally love those eraser pen things but that one is a bit too big in terms of diameter. Theyre not just for erasing mistakes theyve stupidly useful for shading purposes specifically highlighting. Metallic sheen and whatnot becomes much easier when youre using an eraser. I just urge you to give it a try and think outside the box when it comes to using them.,SketchDaily,cf8geo6,1,t5_2sf6f

2879356,0,t1_cnv4ljr,I dont know what you mean by texture lines but i will tell you the things that i do when i sketch For example i will take this guy Most of the lines are to define the planes of the object yellow is the top plane red is the middle and blue is the bottom. Some are to indicate the darkest areas of the object To indicate curves To show details like wrinkles and scales And movement lines to show the movement of the jaw and neck this is optional but i think it gives the drawing a sense of movement.  Any other lines are probably just scribbles. I hope that you find this helpful! If you have other questions feel free to ask me!,SketchDaily,cnvduzz,3,t5_2sf6f

3941174,0,t1_cr280h4,gt I definitely noticed that upvotes do tend to correlate with how early people post and as a result a lot of really great art sometimes goes unnoticed. Not sure how often this is discussed but I personally like the idea of putting on random sort just for the current days thread and only unhiding the votes once the next days thread is posted.I like this idea as well. I often sort by new because I usually come to the threads later in the day but that is a similar problem to going by best or top. A random order could emphasize the statement of upvotes dont equal good art as I also see lots of great work that is just not posted right at the time of the thread opening and so it gets buried. ,SketchDaily,cr5j01r,4,t5_2sf6f

Then you bake the seeds in the oven for a nice snack season with whatever. Take the goo and feed it to your dog. If you dont have a dog go get a dog musnt waste the pumpkin goo. Then youre ready to carve!
