11287384,0,t3_610jlp,The internal furnaces really reduce the protection this base provides by giving raiders something to boost on and taking the place of potential walls. In addition for a base of this size  walls to the center is very bad in my opinion. You also might run into issue with being able to be raid towered. All in all its not the worst but there are much better bases,fortify,dfbeq28,3,t5_38hkf
