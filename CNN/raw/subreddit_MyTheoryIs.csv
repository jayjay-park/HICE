488890,0,t3_1zosk1,There was a time traveling theory I read somewhere about how topast time travel could be possible yet satisfies the question of why we dont see time travelers today.  If anyone knows the source please post it but I dont remember where I read it so I cant. Sorry.Essentially a topast time machine must be built and activated in the destination time at which point anyone who will travel through it will immediately emerge or I suppose it could be set up to send them to a destination time on a delay after it was first activated consider this time A.  At that point time proceeds along until time B at which point that person uses the time machine to travel back to time A.Depending on the specifics it could be a oneuse only device or somehow designed in a way to send travelers to varying times during its existence so that travelers dont end up arriving at the same time with potentially disastrous results.,MyTheoryIs,cfvu9fn,1,t5_306f2
1502888,0,t3_2begc5,I think this is fairly uncontroversial since humans have controlled dog evolution for  years. But its safe to say that dogs were changed by the process far far more than humans were.There is an experiment that was started in  in the USSR to domesticate foxes. It turns out that doing this causes the foxes to gain neonety that is they maintain juvenile traits into adulthood.,MyTheoryIs,cj4nsj0,10,t5_306f2

4361147,0,t1_csh09vz,Very interesting. In response to the image of the radiation continuing without interacting or colliding with anything else doesnt that beg the question of what energy exists in? I was under the impression that physics currently proposed the universe is a closed circuit or a finite amount of energy and not infinite. I thought the universe was kind of stretching itself rather than expanding into a vast and infinite nothingness. How then could the energy continue to move without anything to move against or through? Perhaps this would be similar to light moving through a vacuum but to my understanding weve never created a perfect vacuum so by vacuum we really mean space which is not actually empty. If the energy just expanded by stretching itself like a big rubber band getting thinner and more spread out would that be the most accurate model we can think of? Is the energy bound together?,MyTheoryIs,csh8h5s,1,t5_306f2
4614725,0,t3_3e65qw,Youre kinda right about God being a construct of humans. But dont take this realization too sharply. Yes religions come and fade away and science often gives results where religion does not. Atheists find some solace in rejection of something that was once held highest of all and some even hate religion and God. But satisfaction from hate and nihilism is not good for you. The religions youve come across are probably the ones I call immature.. They are the old religions where a supernatural being with an attitude interferes with humanity. The perennial truth of reality manifests in the purest form of these religions and gives you a more spiritual philosophical approach pure Hinduism Buddhism Jainism Sufism and other religions with a mystical aspect. There is a realization of the ultimate reality these strive for. This epiphany overcomes all desires for material happiness fear of the unknown of death and general ennui of a mundane living. I cant type this idea in words it is something you have to experience for yourself and from your post seems to be what may give you final solace in life. I just hope with my comment you set aside your sadness and desire to give up life and use this realization of yours as a turning point in your life to a better path of satisfaction. Read and get involved in spirituality especially if the religions I mentioned above. I promise at some point you will be happy with what you learn. ,MyTheoryIs,ctc9kuc,1,t5_306f2
6440785,0,t3_3x16op,I would define it as unformed mass. Not that it is unformed but that light hasnt been exposed to other mass for attractability. The only way the excited and unformed energy propagated away was that it escaped attraction. So it is the very inverse of a formed mass that displays attraction in the sense of gravity and weight. But that doesnt mean it can degrade due to attraction. In fact it is probably more fragile than water or sound when it displays attraction to everything including itself. Any display of attraction will immediately result in a breakage of some minute part of the pattern that had previously escalated to propagation. Thus light displays the signature of the radiological structures that affected it.,MyTheoryIs,czlil8l,1,t5_306f2
6801200,0,t1_d0kikc7,gt what i see in this theory is a way to beat entropy of the universeActually it has to do with understanding the nature of entropy in regards to the forward flow of time  with entropy clarified and understood on a deeper level  one of the few ideas in physics that applies to both quantum and classical mechanics. Hawking radiation  just to clarify  was his realization that black holes have entropy  thus they temperature  thus they radiate and eventually dissipate over a long period of time. This leads to the information paradox  what happens to the information once the black hole evaporates?The idea presented above was a solution to the AMPS paper regarding states of entanglement between the eventhorizon of a black hole and matter inside the black hole. The AMPS paper postulated that the hawking radiation would decouple the entanglement  which basically means that the black hole wouldnt an interior connected to space this is past the event horizon  before the singularity. ERERP solution says that the hawking radiation doesnt necessarily decouple the entanglement. Its a trippy idea because it says that WORMHOLES are QUANTUM ENTANGLED PARTICLES are the same phenomenon in physics. We know quite a bit of info about entanglement  and we know nothing about wormholes  but if theyre the same  then it doesnt violate einsteins speedoflight  theres no spooky action at a distance  because entangled particles can be thought of as wormholes  where the spacetime bends and touches.  The entanglement forms the structure of spacetime  basically it hooks space together. gt entire systems could be taken in and out of existence through a black hole possiblythis is the information paradox  and ERERP solution would mean that things are NOT taken in and out of existence in a black holes  it solves that weird paradox  and it allows us to potentially see inside  past the event horizon  its loophole gt find a way to use gravity and dark matterenergy as storage devices although it would take an unconceivable amount of energy it may be just chance or a natural way for the universe to survive maybe im completely wrong.Information theory is also used  and its shown there like an exponential amount of information that can be stored in a black hole  and that most of the information in the universe is located in blackholes  so technically yes  it would take an unconceivable amount of energy  but black holes contain unconceivable amounts of energy  so its all good gt And number  isnt inertia just a property of motion through gravity. I dont thing so. Gravity applies to systems that are accelerating   inertia applies to all systems in motion including at constant velocity  so I think its actually independent of gravity and just a property of the universe  matter itself. So in a spinning universe  calculated classically with inertia in  dimensions  everything would be all weird. But a paper in  showed that the universe could rotate probably requires  dimensions that from the perspective inside the universe  thered be no experience of rotation. It wouldnt make any difference in observation  but it would help elucidate the nature of time  which is something that we really dont understand  at all  when it comes to physics.gt wait are you talking about how most planets seem to have extra orbiting inertia than they should?Its complicated its just a loophole for a godel d universe that spins  but it might explain this.gt  it may be just chance or a natural way for the universe to survive maybe im completely wrongif the universe is alive  it will do everything it can to survive. if the universe is alive  it will probably die. it probably has parents  and it might have children. some of those children may require the universe to exist  for some time  in order for those universe to stabilize and exist on their own. I know the universe is alive. I know deep in my heart this is true. If we are the universe experiencing itself we have the potential to experience the universe from its perspective  if we are it. And by we  I mean the experience of awareness  the observer  independent of mind  independent of thought or language or sensation  just the observer  perpetually occluded from science  may be one observer  the same in me  the same in you  the same in everything.,MyTheoryIs,d0n7j6m,2,t5_306f2

7375524,0,t3_4gdgyi,We could take a small population of people and let them live secluded somewherean island maybe that has minimal on land resources and abundant underwater resources and let them try to survive eventually all the people that were not so great underwater would probably die out and eventually there will be several families there that value a long breath hold and adept swimming capabilities. This population would live their lives out on the island and will probably keep on living through several generations until the population develops physical traits that would be of great benefit to their environmentwebbed digits fins scales gills etc. and pass on those traits to the next generation thus the diverge from one species to another was observed. This would probably happen faster if we used a species that had a shorter life span and would produce more generations per human lifespan.,MyTheoryIs,d2gjnme,1,t5_306f2

8779840,0,t1_d72f8zf,gt I  agree that mass creates gravity I was putting a theory forward WHY mass creates gravityYou dont youre just trying to inverse physics.gt Consider Newtons third lawStop right there. You should know that Newtons law was debunked by Albert Einstein himself saying that gravity is not a force but a consequence of mass.We may still use Newtons laws because it is practical and accurate enough for our needs i.e. shooting rockets into space. But talking about general relativity these laws become inaccurate.gt If you agree that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction then how do you explain the CONSTANT force of gravity on the earths surface?And thats exactly it there is no force therefore no energy used. Its a consequence of a curvature of spacetime caused by mass.So if you really want to explain what gravity is start to explain why mass causes spacetime to bend.,MyTheoryIs,d735exs,1,t5_306f2

11775892,0,t1_dgupc4q,Yes  external environment all information sources received through out five senses ie noninternal brain communication. We are getting deep into this very quickly. Even though I can touch my ear with my hand it is still consider an external event what is not external are the signals sent from the brain to carry out the task. The action itself is an external event in the external environment.Everything is either a variation or verbatim of a past task witnessedin the external environment. Mentor or role model is one way to explain mimicry but does not cover the scope of external environmental mutations that we carry out on a day to day basis.,MyTheoryIs,dguu0i6,1,t5_306f2
