641602,0,t3_21gz28,Musically I like it but goddamn the lower growls are obnoxiously annoying. If this was instrumental with some sweet guitar lead leaving the higher vocals in I would love it. I think thats the problem I have with deathcore in general. The low growls usually suck. I should add I love death tech death progressive metal and some grindcore before you give me shit for saying the low vocals in this blow.,HeadBangToThis,cgd78gb,1,t5_2srzk
