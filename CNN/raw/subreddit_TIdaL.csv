3547949,1,t3_30w93n,Ive been using it amp personally the HiFi streaming is what sold me.  I listen to music  hours a day so it makes a big difference.  I cant listen to compressed track again.  Ive noticed the biggest difference in my home stereo and car stereo.  Im currently on iPhone and will prob switch to an android device because some offer better audio out.  ,TIdaL,cpwot4g,2,t5_2sral
