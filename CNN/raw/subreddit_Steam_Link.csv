Im just used to wearing a headset while I game Id rather not use my nice stereo for my gaming experiences.,Steam_Link,cwrh89u,3,t5_3ad8o
5641844,0,t3_3sd3g9,I thought if you turn off encoding on the steam link it will turn it off on the host machine as well super confused I will try that when Im home,Steam_Link,cwwfb89,1,t5_3ad8o
5672529,0,t1_cx087pd,I would check other games.  Theres a potential that the devices are connected through an old hub or switch that could limit your bandwidth.  Im not familiar enough with encoders to help you there.  I know that theres a command to display frameloss in steam from the streaming computer this case its the link.  I would check that as well.  That way you can rule out network or hardwareencoding as the issue.,Steam_Link,cx08ets,2,t5_3ad8o

6534724,0,t1_czv7aa6,Im confused on how theyre stating that it can transfer at Mbps or .Gbps when Cate only connects at  Mbps but Im not familiar with European standards.I think your best buy is the port Mbps pair   ,Steam_Link,czv8r1m,1,t5_3ad8o
6544786,0,t1_czw8vpp,If you use TV app yes.  If you connect a chromecast or amazon stick on the other HDMI port and try to stream . audio then the answer becomes probably not.,Steam_Link,czwa8g3,1,t5_3ad8o

6644785,0,t3_46nob5,I just bought mine last weekend.  I have a powerful rig in my office and can run any modern game at full graphics with no issues.Setup of the steam link is easy.  Plug it in and make sure you update it!  I cannot stress this enough.  I ran it out of the box without an update and the performance was terrible.Ive tried running with both powerline adapters TPLINK AV and Wifi with ghz and ghz.  Powerline was a dud for me.  I get better performance over wifi hands down.I played Firewatch without a hitch have been playing other mousekeyboard games without many issues.  I will occasionally get stutter or lag.   I couldnt see trying to run a precision shooter with this setup.  Ive got things tuned down to p to compensate.No steam controller so cannot comment.  I am using a wired Xbox  controller Logitech wireless keyboard and Logitech wireless mouse.I have something like  games in my Steam library with  installed and everything has been playable with controller or mousekeyboard.   Im pleased with the purchase just wish I could get the powerline adapters working.,Steam_Link,d06mms3,1,t5_3ad8o

7311527,0,t3_4fj0zf,No. Bluetooth the controller to the link by holding pressing share and the ps button at the same time while at the Bluetooth menu. Once you have the controller paired and in a connected state games will detect it much like an Xbox controller and you will be able to remap buttons within the games themselves. Make sure you hold the PlayStation button down for  seconds until the light turns off when you are done playing as the steam link wont shut the controller of when it is shutdown. ,Steam_Link,d299riz,3,t5_3ad8o
7685904,0,t1_d30ye8d,So Im having the same problem this time after messing with a steam controller profile for RAGE. I cant stream at all anymore and when this happens the only way for it to function again is a factory reset until it happens again.,Steam_Link,d3fu8hq,1,t5_3ad8o

9261165,0,t1_d8pvovh,Hm ok. I logged into the router and extender and their subnet mask is the same. The router has a private LAN IP address of .... while the extender s IP is .. However the extender has a gateway IP of . I assume this just means that it is using the routers IP. Is this considered the same subnet?

9772874,0,t3_5eupkh,Thanks guysgals! I think I will go with a DS after all your input and consideration. I prefer the Xbone s controller but the mapping and support is too good to pass up. BTW on Amazon the two controllers are  which is the lowest I have ever seen so you might want to pick one up.,Steam_Link,dahq1d4,1,t5_3ad8o
9796932,0,t3_5fjkmy,Yes you can do that. I play it that way with my Wavebird connected to the GameCube adapter with the computer. Games are in the steam library.

10159584,0,t1_dbv5ih7,So I reset it to factory settings updated it turned on beta and my first problem booting seems to have gone away.However now my Steam Link cant even see the Xbox One S Controller to connect to it. The only thing that comes to mind is verifying the controllers firmware and updating it but Im on Windows  and from googling it looks like I need one of the following  An Xbox  Windows .So Im pretty helpless with the Xbox controller unless I can somehow get it connected to my steam link OR update the firmware? Im out of ideas.,Steam_Link,dbvn8rc,1,t5_3ad8o
