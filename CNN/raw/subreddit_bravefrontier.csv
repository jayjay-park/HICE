807414,0,t3_23d6mu,So I have some questions about the new units . I have both Tiara and Melchio atm. I tested out in a metal parade run to see if their lightwater BBs stack and from what I can tell it does meaning the units have both water and light attacks. Can anyone confirm this?. If I used say Tiaras BB does that make my units weak to lightning units if they arent a water unit? Also if I used it on an earth unit does that mean it doesnt get bonus damage on lightning units anymore until the buff runs out?. When using Melchios BB it appears that my buffs dissapear for example I used a water seal and I couldnt see it anymore after I used his BB yet when I combine it with Tiaras BB i still get the healing effect even though I cant see the buff on my units. Do the buffs just go invisible? Or does he cancel some buffs out?,bravefrontier,cgw22jn,1,t5_2zich

Either x Serin or SelenaxSerin.Its not a good LONG term investment cuz Serins never getting a  form but the sheer badassery of that squad will carry you pretty far in the game and youll be in a much stronger position in the short term to work on building a longterm team e.g. youll have acquired a lot more gems from clearing quests allowing more rare summons etc.I believe SerinBrigade will clear all of the content in the game right now especially if you get some friends running MalnaplisFalneus.Also try to farm up a Merith for some healing preferably Anima type.  Can get her from Mistral Egon Snowfield nd level shes the boss there is cappable w a high  chance of capture.Others opinions may vary but thats my suggestion D,bravefrontier,chfllgv,1,t5_2zich

1140682,0,t1_chxmkh8,My Zazabis review would just be a pile of flaming ashes and a broken iPhone.For serious though I do actually try to actively focus on positive aspects of a unit rather than the negative since I dont think anyone likes to read about how their unit sucks ass but each comparison is ranked as objectively as I can make it Im not going to say Vanila is a better unit than Sefia for instance I might talk about what advantages she does HAVE over Sefia not a whole lot but Ill never conclude that a unit is better than it actually is. I think the main reason my analyses might come across as overly positive aside from the fact that the new units are genuinely amazing is that I include a lot of outdated units for completeness sake and they just get completely blitzed in the comparison which sets the tone for the new unit as an absolute monster.Basically even though my main focus is a units advantages if I say a unit is better than another thats my genuine opinion from as objective a stance as possible and youll see that Im not exactly ranking each new unit that comes up as the top of the pyramid.,bravefrontier,chxxrfn,2,t5_2zich

1152000,0,t3_27bkq3,Ive created a spreadsheet on Google Sheets to help you keep track of your units and what materials youll needFeatures Maintain a pool of common materials Miracle Totem Mimics Automatically calculates total number of common mats across all sheets Tallies elementspecific numbers from the pools top half Each element gets its own sheet plus a template sheet if you want to branch your ownAny feedback welcome  the link allows you to comment but youll have to duplicate it if you want to modify it for your own purposes.    Update Sorry for the delay in updates or responses  Ive been way more buried than usual and this weekend will probably be similar until Sunday. Having said that Im debating the future viability of Google Sheets for this kind of project. It has worked well so far but some things are getting under my skin. For example I added formatting conditions that change the background color on a given units row if you have what you need or dont to evolve that particular unit. The issue is that it works sometimes not others and is a real PITA as once you copy the rule and paste it the rule goes away more of a CUT than copy. This may end up being something moved to an external source and hosted as a web application but I will be sure to keep everyone posted on the future of this as I think it can be a really helpful tool certainly made my Thursday a little more bearable.,bravefrontier,chz7q90,2,t5_2zich

Sure his leader skill is pretty mediocre in terms of other units that have the same  colour type boost. But his sbb is pretty good right? I mean  hits and increased BC is the same as the felneus sbb if not slightly better because of the extra hit. Sure he isnt particularly in terms of good leader potential but as a rainbow party member he would be ok. Also would having him as an anima be good because it gives him a pretty ok .k hp which is awesome compared to what it used to be XD and I already have one.

1199518,0,t1_ci4k4jx,Thats exactly what Im saying. Because it is impossible to hit over  against metal units they are coded differently. If you have spark leader you hit . That means with the addition of  more spark leader you should hit more than  based on how a double spark lead interacts with any other unit in the game. If my Kikuri hits with no sparks on a target then she hits for  all  per hit. Using a double spark leader like Behemoth every individual hit that she sparks out of the uniform  hits would multiply by . because no SBB from behemoth. This means that . for every hit that Kikuri sparks. This would be on the same enemy of course and whether or not defense is ignored or not the multiplier is constant. This means that because this is untrue for metal units they behave differently and thats the end of the line. Why are you trying to run tests in an environment thats clearly different from the rest of the game. You cant generalize metal units because of the fact that they arent consistent with the rest of the game.,bravefrontier,ci4kbli,1,t5_2zich

1204281,0,t1_ci50kao,Depends on your purpose butEndgame is fairly dependant on survivability.   His RECs high enough that Anima doesnt carry a heavy penalty.   Lords just fine he has enough HP and DEF for current content.   Breaker brings his DEF below par for future content and dark units never resist anything so they arguably need more DEF. However its still enough for current content.    Guardian increases DEF and his buff for now is useful enough that you dont have to be too worried about his damage. Though his BB is powerful enough that a  damage reduction may be significant.   Oracles just... bad for him. He doesnt need more REC and it brings his HP to questionable levels.  So thats the order Im looking at for him in the current meta. Breakers viable for all current content but in future vortexes the super bosses likely raid mode as well it drops just enough bulk that he probably isnt safe as breaker. Guardian may have better future viability than Anima and will almost definitely be above Breaker soon that ones hard for me to say for certain.As for using him for Arena... breaker all the way! His BB charges quickly enough that you dont need him to stay alive very long to be effective.,bravefrontier,ci53llm,1,t5_2zich

1268106,0,t1_cic8ep7,Just saying DuelGX would be a godlike unit for a BB team in his  starsNow onto the main issue for why mono dark is the best choice here The first reason is simply because you would have Magress as the leader meaning your squad would have  HP increase for free. A k HP would now become k with sphere you could reach k easily. Thats k HP increase. The second is because you have less to worry about countering elements since theres only Light to put up a good fight but you could also blow away a Light team too.Now for element specific  Light While Atro also has the  HP increase other units on your dark side are better.     Lilith with the single target BB and Vanila with the random BB cant be compared to any of the member on your dark who all have greate AoE BB.      Lilith BB is quick to fill but not that much faster than Liras who has an AoE BB. Vanila random BB is ok it hits  times but Lira even of Lira only BB on  targets thats already  hits not to mention the spark potential of an  hits AoE. Their different in stats are also very small.      Kikuri also easily beat Lilith and Vanila shes an upgrade version of Lira anyway. Not to mention both Kikuri and Lira have  stars.      Duelmex vs Alice Duelmex is tankier for sure with  HP and  more DEF but that seems to be the only thing he has got against Alice whos anyway supposed to be a glass canon not a tank. Her SBB beats Duelmex in every way more DMG more hits it even heals.     Duelmex vs Magress Duelmex should be the better unit here but not significantly better you think of this pair like comparing Sefia to Kikuri.     In your dark team everyone except for Xenon which is soon to be replaced by a Kikuri good luck! is all nd tier which is the best st is godlike. Alice and Magress have their  stars and Alice is the ONLY unit who is in the st tier anyway. Kikuri simply because she Kikuri. Theres also a reason why uTwofu goes Liracrazy. Your dark team is   units out of  units Fire This team is very competitive I only picked dark because of the  HP and Kikuri over Cayena. Thunder      Eze also has the  HP buff but his survivability is nowhere near Magress.     Kikuri and Lira simply outclass Loch and Amy on hitcount alone both in normal attacks and BB. Amy single target BB is amazing but mostly for killing tough bosses like Karl though.     Elsel vs Alice isnt that fair since Alive wins because of her  stars      Behemoth vs Magress Sefia vs Kikuri Earth Leora Zelban and Bayley simply cannot compete with Lira x  Kikuri. They loses on both statswise and synergywise. Zelban def buff is a life saver to many people but I would prefer Elimo with healdef buff rather than one healer and one buff supporter. Water Same with Fire the  HP from Magress is the main factor here. Though Dean would lose both statswise and bbwise to any of the dark unit here. Reeze lose hitcount wise hence synergy wise.I also like to notice that Im comparing all Amina type simply because its the most preferred type and using the unit in their latest evolutions. Mono dark teams are generally really strong in arena due to their high ATK therefore take out units quickly. This could also be good for quest just switch out a Lira for Elimo if necessary bring orbs and seals. Or best just get SBB for Alice and use her as a healer.     ,bravefrontier,cica13a,2,t5_2zich

I also dont hate Single Target BB so many of the foes I care about are single target bosses such as Xenon or Cursed Estia.  She has the potential to inflict two different status ailments as well.

1276551,0,t1_cid8121,EarthDoesnt seem like a particularly sparky team either way I dont think that a slight improvement in overall hitcount is going to make an appreciable difference. Dilma sports  HP  REC and a whopping  ATK in exchange  DEF sounds like a good trade to me. IMO Dilmas superior stats would far outweigh the benefits of a few extra sparks from Paula. Additionally Dilma will eventually receive a  evolution whereas it is unconfirmed if the goddesses ever will. Just be careful not to overlap Dilmas DEF ignore buffs when activating BB.DarkGiven the units you have Shida doesnt even deserve consideration. Give him the boot.Magress definitely offers the best LS for your dark team. Usually  Magress is sufficient but booting your other Magress doesnt leave you with very much. I doubt youd want to field  STBBs in one team Lico Logan Xenon and between MadiaLemia Magress is definitely the strongest unit. Keep both Magresses.Now your next potentially replaceable units are Lico and Lemia.  STBBs is pushing it and  is pretty ridiculous IMO so you can expect to have  AOE BBers. That will be filled by  Magresses  LemiaMadia. Between Lemia and Madia Madia actually has better stats and more hits on her BB  vs . Madias trielemental BB also puts up a worthy competitor to the poison that Lemias BB carries. Do note however that Lemia is due for her  in the near future whereas the same cant be said for Madia hang on to her since youll probably want to add her back into team eventually.Now for the STBBs. We have  slots for  units. Xenons BB offers the most utility with his ATK buff and his stats are actually pretty good.  slot should go to him pretty easily. Now were down to Logan vs Lico and Id definitely have to give it to Logan. He loses about  ATK and  HP to Lico but in return possesses a whopping ish more DEF. DEF scales a lot better than HP does and overall Id say his stat distribution is a lot more solid for future content. Not to mention the immense sustainability his BBs lifesteal provides that handily trumps Licos probable Weaken.TLDR  Kick Shida Lemia Lico. Add Logan Madia amp Xenon. Replace Madia with Lemia once Lemias  is released. ,bravefrontier,cid89o4,1,t5_2zich

The latest batch requires Totems Pots and Dragon Mimics to evolve their  units. If they didnt increase rates theres no way anyone could do anything with their current units. Feeding a ghost to a  unit is laughable and the reality is that  units are commonplace there just as  units are getting commonplace here.Not saying that Gumi will for sure increase rates once we get that same power creep but there is a method to the madness. And no its not because Alim feels generous its because they HAVE to be generous to keep game balance.And regarding events  weve gotten almost all of the events that JPBF has so Im not sure why people are OMG JPBF HAS EVENTS. And for the events we havent gotten we will eventually. Thats like complaining that a  laptop doesnt have all the bells and whistles of a  laptop. OF COURSE IT DOESNT its olderlags behind!

Having a Logan makes your team unsustainble because your done after one turn. No boss in the game even needs a dual Zebra setup to one shot which is why creating a team for a single boss makes no sense. Using a double Doug setup caters to all content in the game and theres a reason why I have a .m dmg total in one turn using that setup.

1646110,0,t1_cjmlmfx,Go with two Grah leads Lilith Lilith Tree and Tesla. Liliths SBB is much more effective than Michelle in my opinion because Lilith can take advantage of the Divine Stone while Michelle can not. However if you dont have a second Lilith with an optimal typing like Oracle or two Divine Stones then Michelle is still a good choice as that damage buff is strong and she doesnt have bad stats either. Also fighting Maxwell isnt about dealing more damage its about keeping your team going as long as possible and the amount of BC and HC a second Lilith generates versus Michelle is quite advantageous. ,bravefrontier,cjmnmak,2,t5_2zich

Or you could make  mega burnys and then fuse those into  supermega burny.You can continually do this and no one knows a limit. Its one of the best things to do on FP if you lack space and currently have no units to level. Yes you lose  of the value but space can be a huge issue as FP.This is also why fusing past ss you either dont use dont want anymore or wont be all too viable can level up your new units fast.,bravefrontier,cjz1zft,18,t5_2zich

1804874,0,t1_ck6dqvl,Dont rush it friend. Raise your units and youll beat him easily make sure you guard on the right turns and before the  point blue execution.    Im still against Michele coming lol.    Do your best to get Lodins SBB before the fight.   Fujin pots are used for clutch heals and as a replacement for divine lights Elimos heals are much better than divines. Flutes are changeable to divine lights if youre bringing ElselFelneus friend.    When Karl is nearing the  point sacrifice one unit to attack him and leave the rest on guard. When the attacking unit dies thats when you use your revive.    If youre counting your turns and guarding properly youll have no dead units before the  point. Good luck. ,bravefrontier,ck6nf71,1,t5_2zich

1807085,0,t1_ck6x3xt,Your Bran team seems alright.I would replace Lira for Signas if possible for questing. Lira is beast in Arena because of her low BB fill rate but it also has its drawbacks  its rather weak on its own with no additional effects.Uda is a great pull however it doesnt look like you have the units to utilize him to his fullest.Questing Bran leader Sefia Kajah Oracle Dilma AishaKajahs BB fill rate is quite atrocious from what Ive heard but that should not matter too much because hes a stats beast. If youre uneasy with that you can swap him for Lunaris.Arena Aisha leader Lira Sefia Loch Uda totally forgot you had him for a moment LunarisIn terms of future content Copra is pretty much almost a requirement for later trialsraids whenever it comes out on Global. While hes pretty situational in terms of use dont neglect him either. Sefia ends up becoming one of the most offensive units in the game at current time at least. She will always be a great unit to level however she doesnt bring much to the field other than pure damage. Kajah beats her in terms of damage I think but her BB fill rate isnt as bad as his meaning she can end up doing more damage. Kajah hits like a truck. Oracle is better than Anima IMO because his REC is pretty low. Lucina becomes an ATK buffer in the future although her BB is single target even at stars. Who knows you may pull a Michele or Leorone in that time... Lunaris at stars gains status immunity useful for raiding with a high BC generation team Uda is the best Ares leader for future use until we receive Zelnites batch. Ares leaders are coveted for being able to increase BC generation significantly so that you can spam BB. Aishas SBB has a  CRIT Rate buff. Until you get DuelGX she is the best alternative unless you consider Meltia which nobody uses. I think Bran becomes the second strongest DEF buffer in the game at stars. Alyut gains increased BC generation buff at stars. Overall a great Light unit. Deans SBB is the same as Altris BB  he can heal your team and remove status effects. Best used when you dont need a dedicated healer.,bravefrontier,ck6xbw7,3,t5_2zich

Youll have to experiment with it a bit.Their Leader Skills stack but their SBB buffs do not.Yes if their SBB level is lower the worser buff will overwrite the better buff.Uda has a higher raw BC generation than them Maxwell is for completely different purposes but Zelnite also boosts HC at the same time and guarantees an extra  BC total for the rest of the party. Though honestly speaking I think Maxwell would be best for that party.They will completely smash Douglas out of your party.

Blue Execution does does a lot of damage. Units that dont guard have a very high chance of dying as you experienced. I suggest inching him over  health with one unit while guarding with the rest. After Blue Execution he should be fairly straightforward. The only things you need to be careful of is healing and status effects. Lulys increase in HC drop rate may be enough depending on your hitcount. Though if you find you need more healing she could be supplemented with any premium healer other than Lancia or even Royal Dancer May would suffice. I would suggest replacing Kagatsuci with the healer if you have one because fire units against Karl is not the best. Ideally you would have a Tree which could also take care of status effects. Status effects can be annoying. You could bring a status immunity friend Reeze Kushra or the Twins or just have Stimulants  Holy Waters to take care of the more annoying status effects.It would also be worth bringing along a Lodin friend as a leader for his Thunder element buff. ,bravefrontier,ckp5al6,1,t5_2zich

1981297,0,t1_ckrvfaj,Its the fact that everyone wants Zelnite batch and right before it they increase rates for DuelGX and Michele  staples in the game that are so old at this point its almost impossible to get. So you feel like this is your last chance to go for it so you do. And it just so happens to be right before zelnite batch is released. And I know that zelnite batch rates will be up again when their  stars are released but we all know how hard it is to get the specific units you want even when the rates are up. So you most likely have to take advantage of both times their rates are up. If I skip this one and just try when the  stars are released my chances of getting the units I want are a lot lower unless I have tons of money to throw into the game which I dont. ,bravefrontier,ckry3uz,1,t5_2zich

1989053,0,t1_cksvfmi,Power creep does make them money but only for a short time. It is only a matter of time before the targeted audience becomes sick of the units getting obsolete in a regular basis and then performs a mass exodus. If a company succumbs to power creep i think they are getting lazy in their game design. Look at games like MTG or Hearthstone. They constantly release new content for players to buy and thus make them money but they can also keep the old content from being useless.In every new release of content the player base should be thinking in the lines of Hey these new units will integrate well into my team and can synergize with these combo. Or hey this new unit can actually make my old unit useable. But it isnt the case with Brave Frontier whenever a new batch comes out what is on the players mind is. Wow this new unit is much better than this old unit. Pity I have to replace himdouglas cough cough.EditAnd also the fact that obsoleted units are just there to take up space make it worse. At least give us a mechanic that a maxed out unit can be sold for  gems. Geez,bravefrontier,cksvqsc,1,t5_2zich

Back in Kikuri batch if you made  summons one of the new units was sent to your inbox in his  stars form end of story. We also had elemental rate ups and you can say RNG is RNG all you want but just the volume of people posting their summon results on the first rate up of Zelnite batch clearly shows that something was weird. That was followed by a even more weird  units rate up this has never happened and if you go to the post where people reported their results of the last rate up they are indeed quite better.Also this is a no brainer a highly hyped batch is coming and you want to make money gt you make a low chance rate up so everyone uses their gems. Then you release a higher chance rate up so people use gems even again once the news of better success rate spread. This is hard to prove since we dont have access to the real data we can just do estimations but if Gumi was really fair and only wanted their customers to be happy they would continue doing stuff like they did in the Kikuri batch instead of giving you a frog.,bravefrontier,ckxvxmx,2,t5_2zich

2057060,0,t3_2id4tg,Honestly everyone is having such a great experience in JPBF right now because starting over is extremely tedious especially without auto battle on st run through but their current events  energy and recent  minenergy change makes it x easier to catch up. Its practically like playing everything on super accelerated easy mode really so everyone gets a rush. There is also significantly more content on JPBF currently so even at an accelerated pace itll take new players a bit of time to get through it all. Really the only downside that most people complain about JPBF is their super random RS gate. They dont a heavier skew towards newer units like in Global and units as old as Zizz and Zegar tier are all fair game. This makes for some really random RNG where some players can get AMAZING super meta units within  summons and others will get sergio zizz dryad vampire and  usable units within same amount. TLDR  JPBF is fun because its as close to playing a hacked version of BF as you can get without hacking but the fun is more shortlived if you burn through all the content too quickly.,bravefrontier,cl1apxi,1,t5_2zich

At this point Kajah took up the role and quite possibly judged Azael. Melchio fits in as the instrument of judgement. As in the god of judgement probably not Kajah since he was most likely in prison himself at the time points at a target and Melchio carries it out.

2120364,0,t1_cl9c33b,BB buffs dont stack so you have some conflicts here. Aisha and Rashil both provide crit buffs I would say ditch Rashil since you dont generally need a main healer unless youre doing hard content. Lubradine and Reeze is a bit weird since they provide the same buffs on SBB but Reeze only targets herself.

2187321,0,t1_clhqer0,For one in jp the reason maxwell is better than zebra and mare is because they were nerfed and there is a cap anyways. As far as elimo goes I dont see any room for elimo on maxwell squad no because tree excells at that. Lets look at naruza hes  of the best units in the game put together but are people going to spend hundreds to get him no. Because with naruza those units still do their skills better darv has atk and another defense buff lilly has better bb fill and melchio can attack with all elements. That doesnt mean naruza isnt good. It just means that he isnt the best.     Melchio was replaced by ahvel to those who could get him and darvanshel can attack offering more bb fill than oulu and with maxwells ignore defense more people go for darv anyways in global.Leorone is a prime example as he has many good buffs but do you see everyone using leorone? no. Because they are using michele zelbanrarely and other units who offer better boosts.I didnt say units who used multiple buffs were bad I said that many people prefer units who could give better buffs.I didnt say he wasnt good i just said there were better units.,bravefrontier,clhv0ue,1,t5_2zich

2189538,0,t3_2k4zpn,Some quick thoughts Fire and Dark debuff is interesting. Will need to look at enemy BB damage modifier data to truly determine worth though since Im pretty sure this debuff only stacks additively. Currently unresisted is nice. Dualelement is nice from a convenience point of view but much like Shida doesnt really have much truly practical advantage over monoelement buffs since the majority of tough fights have a single element. In addition not having ALL the elements means these units are less useful for FH and raids than Shida. Stat power creep is real though. If nothing else the units will replace MicheleDias batches through stats alone if their auxiliary buffs are good enough. Speaking of good auxiliary buffs Olnas is fantastic noteworthy and Id definitely consider taking her over Lodin Dia Bran Michele since she can fill out that crit slot as well. Floras good defensive competition though. Ryuka is nice too that ATK buff is negligibly weaker than Micheles so he probably outright replaces Lucina and probably becomes the best WaterEarth buffer in the game. Evis auxiliary effect isnt that great  DEF is pretty good but not amazing. She completely obseletes Zelban though. However there are still merits to using the other EarthWater buffers over her. Unfortunately for her Ryuka seems like a stronger option all round. Im not particularly impressed by Yuuji but I might have to look at her in more detail later. Notably LightDark already exists as a combination in Grah who is likely definitely to receive a  at some point. Also definitely some interesting leader skills looks like lots of BBspam potential. Some options for HP sustaining LSs as well. I dont think this batch will DRASTICALLY change the metagame mainly its the stat creep that gives them the edge over existing elemental buffers but certainly a very good batch of units. I do kind of wish Alim had come up with something a tad more creative than dual elements and super stats however the addition of a new debuff is certainly promising for the future.,bravefrontier,cli56qo,5,t5_2zich

2227269,0,t3_2kmvyb,Depends what Im doing. If its just questing I run a good rainbow team because its a team that has almost a all elements and good damage with survivability compared to a crit team. Personally I find that the help thread is terrible for making teams. I asked there when I was new but all the people that helped were high levels that didnt seem to understand the difficulties i had at the level I was at. I ended up just using them for what units were meta and then formed my own teams regardless of input pretty much. As for forming the actual team I like to have one strong dependant attacker that will provide consistent damage which is helped by adding in attacksparkbb gen buffs. I almost always have a healer because some bosses can really dish out some damage and then I save on items. Ill swap out my healer if I know for sure that I can basically one shot everything. For crit I look just for buffers Atleast  including SGX and for high hit counts for good bc gen and crit chance. While running a Zebra lead or maxwell friend now with a bb gen lead. ,bravefrontier,clmxtro,1,t5_2zich

2249419,0,t3_2kxtcc,I think your friend is missing part of the picture. For one which units are good or not changes based on ones other units ones levelteam cost and their current rarity.For instance take the starters. Sure theyre pretty terrible in the endgame but in the beginning when one has little else theyre great. Then their usefulness starts to decline until one can evolve them at which point they become pretty good again. Their star stats may be underwhelming but their team cost is closer to star units than it is to other stars making them decent filler when one is starting to round out ones team with star units. The point is units have ups and downs its just part of the game.Also take this long term tier list Basically anything from the Less popular tier and up one shouldnt worry about using. As you might notice thats the majority of the units. Furthermore many of the units on the bottom two tiers are freebie units so just about everything from the RS Gate is useable. Sure Lava and Rashil might not be the best units ever but theyre perfectly serviceable. I myself have been using Lancia as my healer since I started the game and it hasnt caused me any problems. And those two Duel SGs he pulled? Elite tier.If sharing this with him doesnt do any good then try reminding him that theyre called guides. As in theyre not telling him what to do.,bravefrontier,clpr0te,1,t5_2zich

2257990,0,t3_2l2bas,ualkarldeath makes a really valid point that I want to touch on as well. The squad I used was Grahdens lead  Legwand Luther  Providence ring Darvanshel  Dandelga Zellha  Medulla Altri  Drevas amp Evil Shard Lilly friend  Dragon Stud and Providence RingWhen using the HP marker tool and turn counting tool you really need to plan ahead and pray to RNGesus. If Destiny is on the turn right after SSRune or directly on the turn with SSRune then I would make sure to save Darvanshels BBSBB for those turns. Usually I would look at the turn table and make sure his SBB was up for Destiny when it wasnt paired with SSRune so that you get the extra def. Depending on your RNG burst healing on SSRune turns wont get Altri killed because of how high his HP is and if he does get targeted at this time his heal should be up right after. This allows all party members to be at good HP during the attack without the mitigation. As already stated if you have Darvanshels BB ready  turns before an important turn then just fire it off. I made myself a safety rule to assume it would always take  turns to fill. This saved me a few times when Maxwell used Meteor on safe turns that I decided to fire off his BB.I hope this helps out! Also the Zellha injury debuff works wonders at crucial moments. Maxwell ended up doing damage as low as  if I recall correctly,bravefrontier,clqt4gl,1,t5_2zich

2329486,0,t1_clzl72f,The Guardian Cloak only works because its is  Extra defense which means you would have k Defense if you had .k Defense. Roughly. Zelban cannot reach heights that reduce to  damage per hit even if all of your units are .k DEF. He only has a  Modifier. The way defense works is that you will need more than k Defense to reduce it to . The formula for the most part is correct and the only reason Defense would make a huge difference is if the boss in question had a crapton of hits and low damage ratios. ,bravefrontier,clzmyd8,1,t5_2zich

2380595,0,t1_cm5y1er,One possibility refers to a family of Rainbow leader skills called Five Lights. They all require  elements in a squad for the leader skill to activate. So if you have Lodin Thunder as your leader you cannot have Uda Thunder in the same squad or the attack bonus portion of Lodins LS wont activate.

2405898,0,t1_cm91scy,I am not counting the release dayperiod either. I am talking about the fact that Gumi BF got the million account milestone on Facebook then got the top places in several Android stores dont remember which ones ... Amazon?  and iTunes Store. This is what boosted the popularity of BF and made some new players coming along the way.   By no means I say though that Gumi is not at fault here they should have been able to solve this problem long ago since we got the same connexion problems last FH already and it also occured several times after a batch was released.  As for multiplayer games I am essentially thinking of smaller apps or flash games like on kongregate or a few MMOs which suddenly gets a good ranking. Usually they will often get server failure here and there. And quite often to be honest. Though I have seen plenty of them dying from it and then closing the game because they did not know how to handle it. If they are able to overcome it then theyd stabilize. An example of MMO would be Dofus who had at least server issues for one year Id say which happened after they were recognized as the top MMO in France though I dont think there are a lot of MMO developed in France to be honest and got a huge amount of players coming. They did solve it after a year and now they are running their business smoothly.   Oh I am also completely aware that they have to figure out a long term solution. But it often takes time. They have to be careful not to take too long but so far most of the player database is still here am I right? So they still have time.   ,bravefrontier,cm92tcd,1,t5_2zich

2425805,0,t3_2n8smi,If you miss the synchronization you miss it totally.I have Maxwell on both  and  also and like you it works for me about  of the time.I usually alternate between Maxwell gt Zellha gt Maxwell gt Zellha with both Zellha at  and .The theory behind the  chance of successful synchronization is because if you did it smoothly without the lag compromising the time interval between your two swiping they will both cast at the same time but if it happens which it happens most of the time you will fuck up the entire sparking.Alternating gives a better chance of sparking at least in my case because if you pause a bit during the interval you will realize that you will spark  out of  hits of Maxwell if it does go through with the first hit serving as the timing of the interval. Something like rDoyoFroyo mentionedPosition AFAIK does not affect your chances of sparking at all Maxwell is basically just standing there during the SBB casting so theoretically positioning factor should be completely redundant unlike units like Zellha.,bravefrontier,cmbjc5a,1,t5_2zich

2495676,0,t1_cmk6pww,Even without Maxwell I would say that Mare is now better than Zebra in general. She gives  Weakness damage which is  chance if the attackers element is correct vs. Crit which is . So Mare Leader   Mono Units   Damage  of the time against a weak boss. Zebra   Mono Units   Damage when you factor in  crit chance. So its the same except Mares damage is  guaranteed whereas you could get monumentally unlucky with Zebra and have few people or even nobody crit. The  is on average And this is assuming DuelSGX or Amanohabaken etc. because normal crit chance is only !So Ill sacrifice  damage on average for more consistency especially against GGC bosses where RNG screwing with you can cost you  gems if youre lucky. Zebra also is useless without a crit buffer and I dont know of any notable crit buffers that dont come from the RS Gate. So since Zebra is almost useless without some help from the RS gate it seems just as valid to recommend pulling for Mariudeth who does Zebra and SGXs job all in one. ,bravefrontier,cmkbmoq,0,t5_2zich

2512298,0,t3_2ocsqc,How about a unit that has a one time resurrect back to say  HP if killed? Similar to some of the bosses weve seen.To balance this maybe the effectbuff only applies if the SBB is used and only once per stage. The buff applies to the whole team but is expended as soon as one unit dies. Basically your first unit that dies will resurrect but others wont.I dont think this is super OP but it would help a lot against bosses such as Emperor Verdute.,bravefrontier,cmmhuz9,1,t5_2zich

In arena you want to kill as many units as possible in the first turn OR get all brave bursts maxed.This is my first turn with  units killedThis is another good round with good damage  turn killAnd here is the ideal which happens practically every time usually get  SBB in first turn. Zelnite uses his SBB which maxed out Elza and got every unit using there respective SBB in nd turn.Basically if I had a healer on my account it would do no good.

2549117,0,t3_2ox3st,Took me about  tries or so. Happy I could finally make it. This were my squadsSquad   Zelnite A SBB  Lead and frogged with Medulla Gem and Sol Creator. Luther A SBB  frogged with Omni Gizmo and Mystic Lantern. Orwen A SBB  with Black Lance. Logan L SBB  with Sacred Jewel. Dilma L SBB  with Medulla Gem. Darvanshel A SBB  Friend and frogged with Evil Shard and Dandelga I believe.Squad  Lilly Matah A SBB  Lead with Providence Ring. Rowgen A SBB  Frogged with Legwand Gem and Steeple Rose. Exvehl L SBB  with Drevas. Rashil L SBB  with Lexida. Darvanshel G SBB  frogged with Batootha and Evil Shard. Grahdens L BB  Friend and frogged with Providence Ring and something else cant remember. Basically I used the first squad to clear the first two bosses. With Zelnite lead you can easily mantain BBs and heal a lot without using a real healer. Logan is amazing since he can sustain himself forever with his BB and deals nice damage Dilma heals himself aswell and with Black Lance on Orwen I had even more sustain. I killed Juggernaut and Abadon without using items usually  dies with Abadon if im not super careful but doesnt really matter. When I got to Maxwell I took like  of her HP with them so it helps. Then came the real Maxwell killer squad. I assume everyone know how it works but I used some different units compared to the optimal squad. Rashil my only  healer proved really useful actually the crit buff is reaaaaally nice for Rowgens damage I think its about k damage with Elem buff and a Spark and with his SBB angel idol you can heal with him without the worry of him dying even when youre not mitigating. Lexida helps aswell with the HP and Rec boost more survivability and greater heals. Everyone else is pretty much the same.

If you have a stronger attack buffer then buff overwriting happens and since Darvanshel isnt in the party you lose Darvs marginally useful defense buff which is more useful than Sierras buff if you already have an attack buffer.

It would take some time to make a VMMORPG SAO be connected to the storyline of the Gods.This is also the reason why units Kirito Asuna Heathcliff etc. cannot be made even as RS units.

Nope.No Raid  Shitty servers.Laggy game  Shitty servers  Shitty software.Gumi doesnt need to create any new content  their sole job is to port the one created by Alim to us  and even that they manage to somehow fuck upturn into moneygrabbing.Alim has to create design test and balance new content and software updates all the time and they do it both impeccably and lightning fast.

2797803,0,t1_cnm36qn,Crystals are a little rare but there are events such as the current super honor summon rate up where they fall in plentiful bounty from the sky or super metal parades. Frogs deffo hang onto til later. Mimics are suuuper easy to farm from quests and from weekly wednesday dungeons. I generally only keep  mimics  winged  bat mimics max in inventory at any one time. Frogs are kiiinda rare since each unit chews through a lot of them to get to SBB   so try not to waste or youll regret it!

He suffered a lot of wounds and began to regret killing her. He was met by Arc who challenged him to a fight. During the middle of the fight Vargas began to laugh at the knights words which caused him to get killed. His death caused the Agni Empire to lose all of their power and fall.Selena escaped from Ulkinas attacks after her friend died fighting with the magician. She became angry after hearing Arcs words. She told her last words to him before she gets killed. Even if thats true I still wont forgive you! Her death ended the resistance and people started to go a new land.Lances body was slowly fading away from using Drevas he suddenly took shots fired by Rowgen Lance used its power to destroy the sniper but with the cost of his lifespan he was severely weakened by it. Lance chose his fate over death as his entire body turn into a tree after hearing Arcs words.Eze was suddenly attacked by Kuhla who tried to kill him he had no intentions fighting a human woman but after acknowledging her determination he destroyed her. He laughed at Arc and shouted at the knight before he began to kill himself. The only person who can destroy me is myself!Atro was forced to surrender when Kuda threatened him by taking the orphan as hostage. He lets Arc take his life after hearing his words but Arc left him in a mortal condition. Atro sees Kuda releasing the orphan and threw his sword at him destroying the assassin. He succumbed to his fatal wounds and told his last words at Arc. Give the children a brighter future.Magress was cornered when his friends were killed by Narza his last surviving friend who was called a traitor sacrificed himself by taking the mad knights blade. After witnessing his friends death he abandoned his blind quest to seek vengeance and killed Narza while taking all of his attacks. Arc appeared and told him something Magress took off his armor and shield and kept his beloved weapon with him and challenged Arc to a duel. Magress later died in a duel and left his gratitude so he can die as a true knight.TLDR Ulkinas batch died fighting against their enemies.

2891309,0,t1_cnwq80p,Honestly its your preference. Ive asked this exact same question before and received mixed answers. Let me present your options Guardian  mitigators can benefit from being a guardian type because they should have more tankiness for survival Breaker  Shera in this case has a MT SBB with a high hit count that can pack more of an offensive punch when using a Breaker type.Now lets go over spheres. Shera will benefit from both Dandelga and a BB boosting sphere such as Evil Shard. Dandelga will give you more health and ATK so ultimately depending on type youll either gain more ATK at the cost of a little DEF Breaker or a little more balanced  Guardian. Recently Ive been hearing that Anima  Breaker which I can understand why because of the meta shift and the DEF lost from Breaker types is minuscule compared to the higher gains from gaining more ATK. I hope this helps in your decision making.,bravefrontier,cnwquk0,1,t5_2zich

Thats just silly to me. If you are happy gimping yourself and replaying boring content over and over for zero gain and thats fun to you great... Rewards could easily scale without impacting anything. Get  gem on clear first time through up the difficulty and get  gems first time clear. Make a dungeon with  levels each  much harder than the last with good rewards worth constantly tweaking a group and trying new things out for. I shouldnt have to come up with the ideas for Gumi many games already do these things and last a lot longer than  months.If you really look around here the reason most people keep playing is because they like the art of the units.

Currently all quests are able to beaten by oneshotting either with a crit team or a critspark team.  So why would one want additional HP instead of ATK?  Additional ATK means that enemy units die faster during the attack leading to more hits being overkill leading to additional BC generation which fuels the ability to repeat the process the following turn.Also can you explain rating an Breaker unit over an Anima unit in arena?  A Breaker unit can be oneshot by an Anima unit consistently but the converse is not always true.  ,bravefrontier,coc8bya,0,t5_2zich

Would it be fairrealistic to ask the mods to spend money on gems to summon units in order to write unit overviews or comment on new game mechanics. Yes you dont necessarily need to own the unit to evaluate it but how accurate is that? How many of you have stopped yourself from pulling due to a unit overview? i know i have.

3065872,0,t1_cod5nba,I agree it is usually a hasstle.Though the dying before another part cuts both ways.  in FH sometimes you need to hit one target a lot harder than others so that all die.  Or for example with the Reed batch dungeons you want to kill the high HP target before the pet.  In both of those cases single target high damage is very useful.But overall AoE is more useful because it is easier to use.  I suppose half of my point is simply around the word viable. This game is too easy so almost anything is viable.   You can probably clear all content in the game with only single target damage dealers.,bravefrontier,cofrw3v,1,t5_2zich

3435881,0,t1_cpjtjlj,That team is probably fine for OTKing the final bosses if you have your maxwells sphered and equipped with Heavenly Bud or Steeple Rose but I cant say for sure because I dont know how much HP Zurg has. But on the whole Melchio should really be replaced with someone like DuelSGX Ardin Yujeh or even Grahdens Drevas  Ishirs Guise. Dual Maxwells gives you  LightElemental hits so you dont really need a lightelement buffer you need a DarkElement buffer to get more points in this FH. In that past OTK strategy has always netted me enough for the Legwand and  Ranks but ever since the FH with Zelnite as a boss ... OTK just has not been good enough to generate enough BC. This one is not as bad since theres only one singleboss fight so might an OTK team can actually generate enough BC. The problem is that you really need Steeple RoseHeavenly Bud or something to make sure you do enough damage but also you really want Sol Creators on everyone to make up for not having a BC leader. The standard team Ive been using for the past  Frontier Hunter events is Double Zelnite Leaders  Orna Lucca Yujeh and Shera. Thats a solid team with all elements and no problem sustaining BC and HC pretty good for TK if you just choose to do BBs instead of SBBs on a few units at the right times. Double Zelnite means you have up to BC instantly available for the other  members and BC for each opposite Zelnite which is immensely useful. ,bravefrontier,cpjwzin,2,t5_2zich

For BBs it still just adds . to the damage modifier formula its just like using Luccas SBB. In the end it doesnt make a huge difference because the lost ATK wont result in a huge loss of damage but the added defense really doesnt add very much survivabiliy at all. The ATK has more effect than DEF. It takes  DEF to mitigate  point of damage and it can be ignored by the enemy in several different ways so its just not the greatest stat. Hopefully they fix that soon. ,bravefrontier,cptti1e,1,t5_2zich

3530510,0,t1_cpujfxm,Your comments for each one of these spheres is bloody ridiculous. The fact that you wont get any of these spheres soon is not a reasonable argument for saying that these spheres are worthless. If you wish to stomp something into the ground just because youre pissed that you missed a few arena orbs then go for it. But now youre just lying to yourself. A short illustration   gt HeroponKoe Shiny Anklet  AMAZING arena sphere.  gt You Shiny anklet  limited to arena.    Thats exactly what he has been saying its an arena sphere... Also Shiny Anklet adds a little over  damage from normal attacks Amano just increases your attack by  the crit percentage from Amano is not enough compared to Shiny Anklets guaranteed success to redeem its use in Arena.... In a reasonable Arena squad youll bash your opponents squad in a single turn with just normal attacks. So therefore in Arena Shiny Anklet gt Amanohabaken. Trying to argue that Amanobaken is more useful in another trials quests etc... than Shiny Anklet is useless because again it is meant to be an Arena sphere. Im not going to bitch about Drevas being useless in Arena because it doesnt boost ATK right?  BC gen is an added bonus in case you didnt manage to TK your opponent in Arena. In any case it is useful because I dont use a LS that boosts BB gauges fill rates or anything only ZurgUltors LS. You wont need to rely on Sinister OrbHallowed Skulls spheres for anyone that doesnt carry a Lexida because they have a damage penalty of  respectively.,bravefrontier,cpupag7,1,t5_2zich

3582450,0,t1_cq0m1uw,Okay first unit that blows me out of the water is Kanon. Right now he is arguably the best statusmanager unit in game at  star although he does not have a heal like ulkinarigness however at  star his cost his  so probably too high for you right now. Definitely worth maxing in the future when you can clear harder content.        Rowgen is a really good unit you have there his sbb when used instantly fills his own bb to max so you pretty much have infinite sbb unless the boss can drain bb gauge. Definitely a good unit to have and worth maxing to  star.    Fiora and ardin definitely worth keeping however they both have the same debuff on sbb so you get a duplicated effect. doesnt mean you cant use them together though. Worth noting that Ardin is by far better than fiora in arena and unresisted element.    however you dont really have a mitigator unit which is pretty much necessary for some content and will help with miracle totems to evolve units to  star so Id advise just maxing the units you have now to  star and save your gems for a most wanted unitsmitigator rate up event. Like I mentioned earlier the units are Shera Darvanshel Narza Oulu.    Lario is a good leader for spark teamssub for frontier hunter because his sbb is  hits with a bc drop buff to the team.    Priscilla is a good unit for cardes trial in the future because she gives you party the chance to inflict paralysisweaken keep her.    Mifune is like a nuker with his sbb its one massive hit so if you can spark it youre gonna wipe a lot of hp at once.    imho lance is the worst of all the starters at  star so unless youre gonna run monoearth doesnt seem very likely I doubt you will need him.    Magress is one of the  most useful starters to have definitely keep him.    TLDR gt  Amazing Kanon Rowgen Sefia when her  star hits global waters  Good Magress Mifune Priscilla Ardin Fiora High Elf Mariudeth Lario  Trash Gambler zeul eze lance imho the  most useless starters     Save summons for a mitigator unit. Mitigation is most useful for hard content other than healing without a doubt.    When doing metal parade at your level I suggest using  key try to time you doing metal parade for when you are going to level up so you can spam more runs.    sorry about the wall of text  I know I didnt elaborate on every single unit for instance high elf will be a good status manager until you can use kanon you can of course look up your units final forms on the brave frontier wiki and see what you want to prioritise based on your cost etc.,bravefrontier,cq0mmba,1,t5_2zich

The two teams that Ive tried areTeamRosetta lead Sol  LeomurgShera Paskuan  DandelgaZelnite Sol  MedullaTridon Miroku  UriasRigness DrevasFeeva friendTeam Grah lead LexidaShera Paskuan  DandelgaZelnite Sol  MedullaTridon Miroku  UriasRigness DrevasLilly Matah friendBoth teams are getting pretty much wiped at the  Endless. Last run Shera got killed after  consecutive Destinys. So yeah...tough battle. Im thinking that Tridon is not good in this nonleader role  his shield isnt as effective as  mitigation and he does so little damage. The first team was a lot more effective than the second probably because I had to take fewer total hits due to significantly higher damage. Other notable units that could step inDarvenshel Ciara Oulu Selena Elimo Kuhla Orna Zedus Shida Luka Elza Zergel and Lunaris.

Thats why if you use a unit with  mitigation like Elimo after Shera you will only have  mitigation. Attack buffs on the other hand sometimes stack and sometimes dont. I dont know the details there but I think unit attack buffs will overwrite each other but using a Shera and an attack pot will stack. Its additive in that case.

3896980,0,t1_cr0gofi,Squad composition depends on which questtrialetc you are fighting. Obviously one option is to do rare summons to  hopefully get some newer units. If you need gems you can focus on clearing quests to get gems. The spheres from the Grand Gaia Chronicles are helpful if you havent beaten those. Out of your current units I would focus on   Oulu because  reduction in damage is almost mandatory in current hard content. Hes not the best mitigator but he will get  eventually.   Selena becomes an arena monster at  with Lexida equipped.   Magress is very strong at  with Leomurg.   Mifune at  is a major glass cannon.   Shida is king of Frontier Hunter.   Radyn is a useful spark buffer.   Matah is useful for trials.   Units that will get a  form eventually Elimo Altri Alice Elsel.

No. Not even for the arena.Currently my  stars are Quaid Claire Kanon Alpha Atro Selena and Magress and other than my arena squad I only use  per squad simply because....

Depending on the purpose of the squad Rosetta is better than Claire especially if I need her LS Rigness is better than Kanon if I need his healing Zelnite is better than Quaid although they serve totally different purposes Quaid as a subunit can easily be subbed out Alpha I really havent found the use for and the starters are just starters..

4090485,0,t1_crmhxyc,End game team comps differ on their purpose. There is the OTK kill or be killed team focusing on maximizing dmg done. You use dmg leaders like Colt Kira Maxwell Rage Claire Rosetta and high dmg subs.There is the Trials team built to handle a specific trial. Often has a lily matahdiana lead dedicated healer mitigator and back up bb supportinsta bb fill unit. May or may not have an infinite sbb unit.There is the raids team which differs on comp depending on what raid class it is used. For high RC runs a survival leader with hp and def LS and a mitigator is required. High def buffer units like canon is highly recommended as well.There is the arena team focusing on an atk up leader and easy bb fill unitsunits with high DC on normal atk with hit up spheres for nd turn BB.A cookie cutter general purpose team would always have a mitigator a source of healing source of bb maintenance status cleanse and dmg buffer.For trial  if you cant  shot Grah you should always have a sacrificial unit for the first team.

4371716,0,t1_csid92i,Yes focus on Elimo and get her to  .Of the list shown I suggest Rin would be an interesting lead.  There is some LS lock but it doesnt last long.  So having another cleasner would be nice insurance against curse.  But Rins autocuring would be very good.  An ideal friend would be a Kanon or another HP boosting lead. Diana sub.  You will need BB boosting.  A lot of it. Selena.  Angel Idol.  HoT.  UBB.  She will put in some work for you. Claire for damage boost. If you use Rosetta as a lead then you need to get HPDef tankiness from the rest of the team and your friend.Some other notes from my own experience  Avoid light or dark units.  It will be hard for them to survive one with Lafdrayna would work.

His def buff is a bit too weak imho. If you ever get yourself a Melchio though or plan to use Balgran regularly Aaron becomes crazy good.Yup while you dont have cost for a full  squad Rigness may be the best option but in the long run Rinon is better.

4453348,0,t3_3c3jj3,I was surprised at how bad Alice was. If they kept a good heal on her SBB maybe she would be more useful but really I cant imagine why youd want to use her if you have Selena an easytoget  whos always been around. Selenas UBB just completely heals you for  turns and gives a hit count bonus so its just blatantly superior. Yeah I supposed of you use Alices UBB for a  REC boost and then use her SBB the next turn you get a pretty nice Attack power increase but it would be a million times better with a hit increase like Ruby!The only thing Alice has going for her is that she has a BB with really good effects. In a dodgy situation with poor BC production a healing and cursing attack BB for only  BC is pretty nice. Aside from that shes incredibly underwhelming. Selena and Ruby are both significantly better. And since you cant really overlap UBB effects without a Hero Crystal And even then only for  turn IF the first effect is a turn effect Ruby is just an overall superior RecATK buffer. ,bravefrontier,css114p,1,t5_2zich

Thanks for posting this.Anyways enough chatter.  The BC engine started slow with this build due to less generating spheres even with Fujin on Kkr. The first Fei was easy just make sure to check his HP to keep him from suiciding too soon. The soul siphon at  was easy to push past with the dmg output. The next Fei I didnt think my SBB would take him out after rd bomb turn so I overdrived overdrove? at the nd turn and blasted him on the rd.  UBB still up I knocked her well into next soul siphon while next Fei came out lol! I thought I was going to break mechanics.

4606420,0,t3_3e1jtr,Really its simple for Ultor and Tridon. Ultor  Decent damage modifiers to go with that excellent ATK stat none of this  AOE bullcrap.  Something unique added to his Taunt mechanic How about Increases max HP by  or SelfMitigation? Or maybe a Fire Shield?Tridon MoreDifferent Shield Elements. Unless they start releasing more units with shields its lame that the ONLY two shields available to us are nonelemental Egg Item or EarthElemental.  Healing or BB Generation besides just a BC drop buff. Aurelia is really the only one with any type of healing and Tridon has his RECHP LS so I dont see why he has a BC buff instead of some form of healing. Maybe something similar to Alyuts  SBB except instead of the DEFgtATK buff he has the shield. Their leader skills are honestly pretty good already so theres room for improvement but as long as they give them great stats and usable moves I dont think well be too disappointed. I might like to see an interesting tidbit added like Ultor can nullify Weak Elements and Tridon could Nullify Criticals.

Feeva as a subunit can heal your team just fine since her LS has nothing to do with HC production.Good thing to note since Zenia also has a BB Damage Modifier buff Dion wont be the best choice for Crit buffing. Id go with Kira or Colt instead.Speaking of Colt hes an interesting choice over Kira since he also provides the gradual BB gauge buff. Worth looking into if youre not running anyone else with that particular buff. units help quite a bit with Ultor. I used to run Ultor leaderSelenaMagressAtroKuda and had an effective  win rate. The loss of HP does kind of suck but Id say its worth it so you dont have to use lowertier units like Belfura.For Arena I like to use units that can generate a large amount of BC with their normal attacks. BB thresholds arent exactly hard to overcome these days so you dont have to worry too much about that. Having a multiple target BB is the norm but if youve got a great LS like Ultor then it can be forgiven or you could slap UriasAlzeon PearlHeresy Orb on him so he fills his SBB gauge more often.,bravefrontier,ctbthk4,1,t5_2zich

Tridon is a beast... but im curious if the new client update will have any changes for how shield works. Seems kinda silly that he has a def buff and a shield that isnt affected by that buff in the same move. Also... the lack of mitigators that arent def buffs limits setups a little. Pretty much just edea and shera. Honestly id probably use eleimo for def leader. Also whats with that completely random  self buff on tridons UBB ,bravefrontier,ctc1vxl,7,t5_2zich

4624893,0,t1_ctdixb8,I think it was honestly easier but not by much.  Both of those fights had so much RNG that could screw you over.  Tack on the fact that I ran out of crescent dews so I was using  revive lights and  revive each run and could have really used the extra  revives made it difficult.  The problem with  wings is that unless you can effectively hit most of the units with attack down and also do a large amount of damage their combined crits and nukes will devastate you.  I finally found the right team set up with Coltlead Quaid for his elemental bonus damage Griel for the BCHC generation and atk down Fadahl for his ATk down and injury proc and Aaron for mitigation and damage.  I used Raaga as a friend for the spark damage bonus which increased damage immeasurably.  This setup finally worked where the spark buff ended up being the real MVP for me.  As long as you can get past stage  stage  is a breeze.  Just goddess idol one unit and guard everyone or nuke SGX down.  I managed to kill him before his ultimate attack so it was quick. BampB was harder trying to balance the damage output especially when Kikuri killed a unit and you had to stop all damage on sefia to catch back up.,bravefrontier,ctdjhno,1,t5_2zich

4630666,0,t3_3ee5er,Hello! Welcome to the game! Ill try to answer your questions as best as I can.Does this game require you to have a guild or something like that or is it a one player game like OPTC?Theres no guild or clan in this game. You can however add people as friends and take their unit with you on your adventures.Is this a good time to start?Not really. The server has seen better days than today but that aside now is a good a time to start as any other time I think.Is there different Tiers for units you can obtain?Im not quite sure I understand what you are referring to by Tiers. In terms of usefulness we have a ranking by votes or personal preference of some sort. You can also check out Ushi Gaming Channel on YouTube. He does unit reviews on the new units that are released and you can look up specific unit reviews that you want to watch.Can this game be played continuously or is there some sort of stamina that restricts you from playing?We have an energybased system here. Doing quests or dungeons require energy that recharges by one every three minutes.Are there specific units I should be going for? Not really. Theres quite a lot of units with the same core functions and different combinations can still get you the buffs you need to form a solid squad. If youre a free player just make do with what you have and add friends with units that has buffs you lack. If youre a casher well wait for rate ups and check the wikia to see which units you like or want and summon then.Lastly since this game has been out for a while would it be too forward to ask for a giveaway fresh account that contains a good beginning roll?I doubt theres anyone here that would do that including myself. Quite a few of us play multiple accounts due to the energy limit or simply because we have nothing better to do with our time. And if we did happen to get a good beginning roll we would probably invest our time in playing that account and not give it away instead. Good luck on your first free summon though!Edit I apologize for the poor formatting but I cant seem to make more space between the paragraphs of some sort.,bravefrontier,cte9l6q,1,t5_2zich

If you have the units required for using him effectively then he is extremely competitive and probably better than Deimos. Ultor can both deal top class damage and tank hits.  His UBB is probably the best in the game because it provides  mitigation while also dealing ridiculous damage both for Ultor and the rest of the party. His only real flaw is his lack of health which can be worked around with HP buffing LS. For the record Ultor gt Uda as an arena leader and unit especially once Blades of Ultor are equipped and Ultor has his angel idol buff. ,bravefrontier,ctf0tb6,1,t5_2zich

I try and put as many links provided or links that I know. Be sure to check out them out because they tend to follow up on their works and color it in If you would like to participate all you have to do is tag your art on twitter withRules are located here and they will announce what the next subject will be about a day or two ahead of posting dates. Important!tg Follow this person to receive announcements!Dont worry so much about the language barrier. Even if you do not speakread Japanese you are still allowed to post. redfire has translated the rules here.Rules Everyone is welcome beginners are encouraged to join. Post the Finished product in Twitter with the hash tag   Medium doesnt matter Digital or Analog No R material no Hentai lol or copying tracing. Can be a little late Not sure but the judging will end hrs after due date You can choose to do  or multiple themes if there are more than one theme for a particular week. Boss Units also can be drawn but limited to the JP version of the game lol so raid bosses can work too? Units that arent yet implemented in game are not allowed. Collab Units can also be drawn again limited to JP version. Multiple units can be drawn as long as one of them fit the theme. If using collab units you must draw them together with a BF unit since otherwise its not BF related Changing the costumes of the units is fine Feeva in a suit  OK  Slight Hair change OK but extreme is a nono Im too sure but I think extreme is like giving Maxwell a braid or something...

4690980,0,t1_ctlt0hy,I think  where HPgtATK Buffs can shine is when youre using HPBoosting leads which is a very obviouspopular tactic. A unit like ColtClaire with Anima Typing and ES Activated could very easily have around  HP. That  Convert results in a conversion of  HP which is excellent considering this is an SBB not a UBB. You can then throw in Quaids UBB or even Selenas which have magnificent synergy with ATKConversion buffs and start nuking the hell out of a single target while generating a ton of BC. Unfortunately Rubys would not work unless you did her UBB first since she converts REC to ATK. Of course since were on the subject of Ruby theres a decent chance of having k REC in Global with leaders like Tridon and Colt and RECboosting effects from FeevaDeimos so her UBB by itself might be generally superior since its all in one package. However Quaids Elements combined with the HPgtATK is almost assuredly superior if you dont already get your element buffs somewhere else. ,bravefrontier,ctlu9ki,0,t5_2zich

4785237,0,t1_ctxpjyw,Heres whats absolutely necessary to bring alongThe only specific units I actually mentioned in that heading were... Grah who is a free unit that everyone thats attempting frontier gate should have fully maxed anyway and even then I also said that an alternative would be vague double bulk leaders whereby I listed examples.  Deimos who was listed under HP regenerator OR Deimos meaning you are not locked to bringing Deimos but you ARE locked to bringing someone that can help you beat floor  which is akin to saying btw bring someone that can deal with jelly on floor . Everything else under that heading is broken down by role and not by actual unit healer mitigator etc. Only under highly recommend do I actually mention specific rare units. And highly recommend  absolutely necessaryI also like the implication that you encompass every reader thats out there. You find the long post I wrote abhorrent I think its totally readable to anyone who actually has trouble with this battle.If those people dont have those certain units?  BTW brave frontiers gameplay and difficulty is all about having the right units and constructing the right team. If you dont have the right set of units you simply cant win e.g. if you dont have any status healers or status negation leader you wont win most boss fights. You think back when Maxwell was released and the only two usable mitigators available at that time were Oulu and Darvanshel and Oulu was significantly worse because he didnt attack and generate BC people would be complaining WHAT IF I DONT HAVE A MITIGATOR? when they were asking for help on Maxwell?,bravefrontier,ctxpw2r,2,t5_2zich

4852058,0,t1_cu646lf,Ok first things first.  SHS is coming tomorrow consider getting honor points to abuse it for free crystals and perhaps even a sphere frog. It helps a lot.  Second is it possible for you to play BF on a pc? Since BF was released for Windows . performance has never been so good on any device ever. Consider that if you think your phone cant handle it properly.  As for GGCs the six heroes GGCs are the easiest. Dandelga is a sphere I would recommend getting for Shera while Batootha is a sphere that greatly augments damage in FH. While Vargas his GGC is easy to do Eze can be more of a problem if you cant handle status ailments Elimo with Drevas should solve that though.  As for WVA try to battle against users who dont use a Selena lead. You should slowly get up the ranks so that you at least get a gem for obtaining the next rank and a couple of free evo mats   As for FH completing the last stage generally depends on the season since it changes every time... However general cookie cutter teams simply use units with high hit counts. In your case Id recommend a Raaga as lead Shera Ulkina Elza and Orna. If you happen to have the time however I would sincerely replace Elza with a Feeva once you have Feevas SBB unlocked.   ,bravefrontier,cu64z8o,1,t5_2zich

You dont even have to attack with Quaid.EDIT It seems some people are having trouble with water imps. I did this with the Windows BF side. Ill try on the Amazon side tonight after work.

I would say shes probably more worthwhile than Ardin on your team as all hes really doing is buffing lightdark and maybe inflicting ATKdown. In fact I would swap out Ardin for Grahdens  who deals more damage and has a nice BC fill effect instead. Andaria and Zedus dont have  yet but I have high hopes. Andaria is actually a really good  unit. Shes very similar to Edea in that she inflicts and cleanses status ailments but instead of mitigation she has a BC fill effect.

Luly and Grybe are really niche use I do not see the need for Vishra except if you do not have a good status inflictor.  Logan well Logan. Luly has to be the most intriguing.  Her SBB with that RECtoDEF convert buff with HCBC buff along with her LS makes her a heck of a leader for an Earth squad.  Not too sure about her UBB though.There are really good ATK DWN units right now so not sure about Grybe disappointed really.

He is very compact in having mitigation status cleansing heal lightdark buff all in one unit so like others from his batch hes usable in a lot of different situations. And he has nice stats Grahden is only six and a half star at best hes better as a leader instead of a sub for trials etc. so Krantz can survive much better. Edea is nice but most people like krantz better because he could do more by freeing up more slots for other combination in a squad whereas edeas status infliction is a bit niche in the first place and it doesnt inflict curseparalysis where some contents require those status. Personally?

5149620,0,t1_cv5ub74,Honestly I would finish the  heroes over time and consistently work on building up your team. Your level is the most important because GGC will be on the too difficult side barring a couple that you may be able to clear earlier sans the final stage without being able to field a proper  star team. Arguably you can go for it with  strong  and  s but it will be tough as you are definitely disadvantaged due to stats.Best things for you right now would be to leach off raid rooms for every quest you have not done yet in order to get through rc. This will help you craft tridons weapon along with all the others. Additionally there is a GQ tinkerers revenge that will be needed for hadaron  aurelia spheres. All of these things are solid in that you are likely low on spheres overall and require at least decent ones.The global unit spheres are mediocre without the unit but so is a medulla so the argument is pretty much a wash since it gives you more options. Aurelias is overall great because early on you dont have many good secondary spheres. Sacred crystal is for completion of RC content. This is one of the better secondaries in game for BB boosting as well as fulfills Wills ES.In closing do the above level and grind out Frontier Hunter  Merit Points which i basically solely use on spheres and legend stones e.g. prized mercy and demon core whenif it releases. That will be the bulk of your work for a while and will help with your overall team setup. Equipment means a lot and in the beginning stats are greater than anything else. After that you will be in a pretty good position to start attempting more trialsGGCGQ along the way!SidenoteNice summon for Exvehl!

He recently got a oulu and is now slowly clearing content. In the other hand Im a FP player and I have every mitigator but Krantz because I saved for their rate ups and didnt distract myself over shiny new units. But I agree that the game right now is so mitigator oriented that we need an easier access to one specially if they continue the new trend of elemental Frontier Gate for example in the earth one you pretty much need Edea or are screwed. ,bravefrontier,cvb0xow,4,t5_2zich

A normal SBB with  Crit chance will thus provide  Crit Chance giving your units a  Crit Chance  base is always uneffected thus far.

5240967,0,t1_cvhppaq,The problem with your logic is that you could not ever reasonably get Gazia without a mitigation unit and most likely you very much need one of the ones that is not popular as a friend lead Krantz might be the only exception possibly Shera if shes out by then. So any trial unit beyond Cardes ... really you cant do it without Mitigation from an RS mitigator and using friends is not terribly likely. Even Nevsky is damnnear impossible without some RS units though thankfully for newer FP players if they can manage  really good friends like Deimos or Ark they can probably get Nevsky by way of their friend soloing the dungeon. ,bravefrontier,cvhq5v8,3,t5_2zich

5270549,0,t1_cvl8y91,Okay heres a short hopefully guide to stuff like this Summoning gate normally costs  Gems per summon and will pull you a random unit.  This trend is often broken by special events such as Super Rare Summon up or just Special summon events  These events can give certain units higher rates meaning higher chances of you actually getting those mentioned units There have also been gate events that lowered the price for summoning There are also events that increase the gem price but in exchange narrow down the summoning pool Example is the one mentioned above I think? It was  gems for a pool of  units instead of the usual gigantic poolEdit Now what made the Frontier Gate ideal for krantz was that you arent betting on one unit increased in rates vs  others its a small pool of  of which are mostly good or at least decent units. I dont know if that gate is guaranteed to come back but if you really want Krantz then Id suggest you wait for a gate with at least a rate up on him.,bravefrontier,cvlde9a,1,t5_2zich

5305574,0,t3_3no8lj,Its worth noting theyve recently buffed up the Mecha Totems in stage . Up until recently  most likely the last maintenance but Im not  on the timing  you could get close to k with a UBB and usually around k with regular SBB but now youre looking at the k range either way...Ive even failed to kill the Thunder totem with a Zedus UBB. Which doesnt make any sense as my team comp is  Thunder Earth Fire so if anything the Fire totem should survive but its consistently the Thunder one if it happens. Something is screwy here.With the change I personally dont feel its worth UBBing the Mecha Totems as you risk a casualty and your score doesnt improve much. In fact without the turn kill bonus Ive gotten lower scores on average with a UBB than a turn kill SBB. Which never has failed to kill all  so something is really weird on this stage.,bravefrontier,cvpuk51,3,t5_2zich

There is also no way to actually tell anyone in game about this crucial information. A single uninformed player can bring a crit lead and fuck up everyones run. WTF!For a few golden weeks GL had Hardon and he hit single crit resistant boss parts so hard that even if some newb came in with a crit lead and no STBB you could still nuke the crit resistant part.

5371512,0,t1_cvy9itf,. I assume youre talking about the elemental summon it means that any and all summons on that gate will give that element. No restrictions on the unit though its just any unit of that element regardless of rarity or time since release.      . Not on this summon gate better to just wait for popular units rate upactual increased rates for desired unitfhmedal rush summon where the summon pool is limited means only certain units can be summoned. Also Eva is only good as a collection unit and shes pretty useless in the current game version tbh.      . Well you can always try looking up Ushis video guides oops advertising for someone else to see how he does them just keep in mind he literally pulls like every single unit so he pretty much has the best stuff. As an alternative look up the guides at the top of the subreddit for squad comp ideas though they may be slightly outdated. And of course these daily help threads exist for a reason. Post your units and some pro will help you out admittedly I dont keep track of the units that much as compared to last year so I cant help that much anymore for this haha      Hope this helps,bravefrontier,cvy9rns,1,t5_2zich

5419564,0,t1_cw48ptc,The best way to answer the imp question imo is to start by determining your highest priority Arena Raid FGFH farming Trial completion.For Arena.. youd help yourself out a ton if you had ToutetsuHadaron. If so you could do Iris Bestie Zenia Selena as the subs.  Since you dont you should probably go with uTapirboys squad suggestion.  Could also do Quaid lead there if you want to keep Raid spheres on Krantz.Side note It looks like you have all the parts needed for a Dionled FHFG team Dion lead griff rize mahalu rhoaRaid Arkem Zenia lead Krantz Bestie Oguro Tridon Rhoa friendRaid Balmedia Swap Iris or Tazer for OguroRaid Everything else Griff lead Krantz Tridon Will Bestie ugh.. the clash is bothering me ZedusGazia friend depending on the questI typically give mitigators first crack at imps because if mitigator dies your team dies followed by useful leaders then my arena team members then raid team members then finally stuff that is only useful for trials.

5458237,0,t3_3pswwe,IMOexcluding LS Vermillion  Aside from being a reviving unitthat operates based on chance shes essentially Rina with BB regen instead of Status infliction.  Gilgamesh Really lazy kit very simmilar to Vermillion but with Ares on SBB instead of BC regen. His most notable feature is the  hit.  Piany  HOLY SHIT tier UBB and extremely powerful BB. Her SBB is mainly a bonus just like Avant. Favorite unit of this batch simply because of her ability to give options. Spark buffer that does not have on Spark BC fill have  a little bit more fighting chance and Paris Nadore Libera trio for on hit BC fill finally loses their dominance because of existence of Def and Rec buff.Summoning USebachoo because hes going to totally digs on Piany Drevas Thats new for a status cleanser since he provides some infliction reliant offense alongside the most consistent form of status infliction. Honestly hes a really dud pull but this is because im lazy at looking on status inflictor. Kiravel Introduction of Piany SERIOUSLY saved his ass for Spark buffer slot but all unique thing that he offers is.... Attack down.His LS is pretty much OTK oriented but with the dominance of Avant in the meta for every offensive role its not going far and Chrome exists anyway. Dark Pretty much what Luly  should have been BC HC drop Conversion and the related status buff in one kit alongside BC fill to ups the ante. But the existence of Doluku in the meta make him looks really stupid.Darks most notable feature is his UBB. Global players might notice it carries comparable power to Zenia UBB strictly from SBB spamming perspective while having massive defensive buff from  Defense and  gt  attack conversion. Honestly BC instant fill is on a weird place on the meta right now due to its simmilarity to on Spark BC fill but the other part of this units kit isnt exactly mind blowing. Looking forward of what he can do when we have a alternative option to Doruku.EDIT Thunder had  Hits which is significant.

5507330,0,t1_cwfgclo,I assume from what Ive seen on the subreddit that a lot of people like CA for the same reason that I do the consistent challenge and team building strategy involved. Its a very entertaining war of attrition. It makes the game much more accessible to people with less units but more time to think and is just downright fun.  Having the other team go first really takes a lot from that by making you lose units especially your best much faster based on RNG and making the edge shift even more heavily to people who have summoned tons of units in different rarities and have raised them all. Having an opponents unit go first really takes away from the planning ability aspect of CA as well because not many units but Hardaron can give you a good defensive edge while still begin offensive if you go second and even then he may die.Im personally not against having the enemy team go first regardless of Brave Bonus but I can definitely understand the discontent. I think it should heavily scale with brave bonus. The reward for taking the riskier route probably shouldnt be a faceroll and a dead team.,bravefrontier,cwfm1j1,1,t5_2zich

5589393,0,t1_cwptgh3,Im guessing the Dion leads were due to FH Frontier Hunter being up.  The typical squad for that was nuking the middle level with OTK teams and Dion was good for that.Zedus is also good for that as well as raids questing and other places where you can afford to take a pure offensive lead.I wouldnt use your friend list as a compass for your own squad.  Some people just put up leads that they think might be useful but not common.  Thats why I keep Bestie up even if shes losing favor because she is useful as a lead still in some cases and not found often compared to powerhouses like Zedus Avant or Chrome.Anyway your squad looks ok but needs tweaked.  I missed Zenia in your unit list sorry.  Who your lead is depends on the rest of your team and also your friend.  Youll want at least one lead being  hp so if Zedus is your lead you want someone like Tridon Gazia Dolk or at very least ChromeGriffBestie to keep your team alive.  Personally I love Bestie lead as she takes care of all BC problems singlehandedly.Anyway Edea is redundant in that team because Krantz can clear status with his BB.  If you run Zedus Id use Will instead of Zenia since his BB mod is only  less than Zenias but his many other buffs are better than her spark which is overlap with Zedus.  Id do this  Bestie lead  Krantz mitigatorheal  Zedus critspark  Will BB BCHC drop HoT  Melchio DEF convert status null and cleanseI ran this squad with Aaron instead of Krantz for a crap ton of content.

5706473,0,t1_cx4fj1a,Hahaha you know sadly that is exactly what is gonna happen. The majority of this games player base I believe are adolescents and yuppies. All we can really do is let the community know whats happening and try to protect them and ourselves from these scamfests by not buying gems not summoning or stopping at a certain number of pulls when we see a bad rate up.Mobile gaming companies like Gumi will always try to one up their player base because of how these games are designed giant freakin Skinner box. If the player base would only withhold buying gems for a month or  theyll see that they cant keep doing this. Personally I did not buy gems for  months after the Feeva batch scam but when I saw they were improving as a company I started buying again. My conviction is to not buy for another few months because I feel they shouldnt have any profit from me until they better themselves again.But Im one person. My conviction is not something the player base follows. People addicted to the game will still keep throwing money at Gumi despite the amount of salt they pour on these threadsFBtwitter. Like tomorrows anniversary bundles? Haha Im sure a lot of the angry whales will be buying those despite what they say now. Thats just how it is man...   ,bravefrontier,cx4fz7p,1,t5_2zich

5807221,0,t1_cxguljk,Tagging uChibiKylarThe Spark buff does not matter which order it is applied so long as you pull it off within a timely manner. It is applied directly the moment it is cast meaning that the buff priority is low in terms of sequence.However if you are trying to spark a specific units attack say a one hit count unit it is best for them to attack last under a spark blanket where units with high hit counts are currently attacking. A Spark is an additional damage boost when units attack at the exact same time. It is ONLY applied to the units that spark together.The Spark damage boost is dependent on a units hit count. If they are able to spark their only hit their whole damage as a whole is multiplied by the spark buff . If only  hits out of their  hits spark only  of their damage is multiplied by the spark buff. Therefore you want to prioritize sparking units with low hit counts.Hope this clears some stuff up D,bravefrontier,cxgxvq4,2,t5_2zich

5832626,0,t1_cxk5min,In terms of damage output sure if you can incorporate the ATK buff thatll be best. But in raid content I tend to prioritize survivability over damage output so having mitigation and DEF buff up at all times is important for me. Dead units deal no damage and all that. Hence I prefer to be overcautious with BC management. For RC missions you can definitely use an ATK buffer over any other unit. But higher RC missions will require you to consider managing your BB properly. Arguably your units BB gauges will be replenished by means of BC on Spark and BC fill when attacked most of the time but sometimes even that might not be sufficient. There will be bosses with BC drop resistance so Tridons BC drop rate buff will not be sufficient to compensate for lack of BC. Youll want to squeeze the most out of the BCs that do actually drop and thats where the Ares buff plays an important role.I wouldnt really concern myself with the ATK gt DEF conversion since mitigation should be considered first and foremost and therefore I personally would value an Ares buff higher. Tridons standard DEF buff should be more than sufficient in most cases but you can definitely swap in Melchio if survivability is an issue and you have no issue maintaining your units BBs. Theres really not any right or wrong composition just a matter of covering all your bases as much as possible. Experimenting is the only way to find out what you are missing. ,bravefrontier,cxk6n3i,1,t5_2zich

At time of writing there doesnt appear to be any in between seasons demotions.So yes  summon tickets is broken and theyll probably rework it again but they did this to basically see how much they could pull us into actually trying to play CA as opposed to doing nothing to reap the rewards. Theyre pushing the rewards into being more active like how rookie is  worthless now and summoner is only marginally better. So instead of a lof of users getting medium rewards its going to be an initially smaller group that gets periodically reset but better rewards. We dont know if theyll immediately do a season turnover unlikely but possible. IF they do that then this really wont be worth my time in the long run but as long as theres at least a chance of one week  in legendary without having to fight for it Im game.,bravefrontier,cxrbqwo,1,t5_2zich

Usually any more than this would be out of the question but seeing how Elza another of the contest winners got so many buffs maybe an extra buff could be added so it could be a very very viable alternative for ZeruiahIf you play on GLBF though it will be quite a few months from now though easily  months,bravefrontier,cy9wqlw,2,t5_2zich

In order to even have a chance to get the rare material that part must be killed before or at the same time as the main body.Lovely enough in most cases the main body isnt Crit Resistant so if you bring a Crit lead yes like Avant.

Indeed this list should be populated with mostly newer units with native  potential but I chose to select units with no current  potential in global just because theyre the first ones I think about when someone mentions  units. But really even the  versions of most newer units are much better. The only thing that changes from  to  is the ES Stats and UBB. Their BB and SBB effects usually dont dramatically change.

Shes really cool looking and cuteness of the style really fits the game!Now onto the constructive criticism It seems a little too tall. Lots of final form units have more of a spherical look  I recommend having her stand on her own rather than sitting on a skull and maybe have the ghost skeleton wrap around her rather than float above her. As someone else has pointed out most units have their faces tilted to the side so you may want to look out for that. I would keep the skull but tilting her face left and keeping her on the skull would look too similar to Ivris to be honest.Otherwise I dont really have anything else to add!

6475878,0,t1_czonyzh,gtThey powercreep to hellOf course how else are they going to sell new units if you can just beat the new content with older units?  I believe we had a conversation like this a while back.  If units never got stronger then content would not be any stronger thus you are left with the same level of content for  years?  That would be boring people would become uninterested very soon.  The thing you proposed a while back was powercreep by mechanics.  Even if the numbers are all the same some mechanics will be overwhelmingly strong like BB on Hit and of course mitigation.  You pointed to League of Legends being a fair game which makes everything balanced even older champions. Older champions are usually stronger because of unique mechanics something BF doesnt and cant really offer much of strong numbers and simplicity having a point and click ability.  PvP is designed so that everything is balanced while PvE is designed to make it so the content gets steadily stronger and to combat that make stronger units.gtAnd in doing so they dilute the metagame so everyone is using the general same team archetypes with very little variety.Cant argue with that.  New units have way too many buffs now and it feels more like if you have X buffs then youre good to go.gt Then they hide their rewards under boring content that plays more like simon says than a legitimate strategy game.Older content was a simon says kind of game as well.  Grahdens was guard at X threshold Maxwell was guard at X turn I wasnt around for Karl so I cant say much about that.  I do admit however that there is a lot less strategy in this game ever since BB spam became a thing.  This really isnt a strategy game its a unit collecting game that happens to have better content compared to others in the genre.,bravefrontier,czp5hwz,6,t5_2zich

You dont have to imp them if you havent yet but it will make a difference if you doAlso forgot to add Rahgan is a perfectly fine sub. The crit only helps to feel a bit safer in the next turn since it has the potential to kill even  units in  turn. However if you kill at least  and the  enemy units dont focus one unit only unless its Charla or Ivris youll be good.

6532200,0,t1_czuyqcl,Yeah thats why I take Hadaron in my squad to kill bosses that would otherwise be troublesome.I dont think your team is bad by any means in fact its actually pretty good. You have nice animations all around a spark blanket a stong damage LS elemental buffs so you never deal resisted damage and good BB sustain to top it off.You could potentially swap out Shera and Melchio for Edea and Rize but you lose Sheras Atk buff and BCturn and youll probably have a harder time sparking without her too.Have you had any issues with your current team? Even if you cant OTK bosses as long as you can still kill them on full auto I dont really see a reason to change up your current squad since it pretty much does everything youd want a questing squad to do.EDIT It might be worth seeing if you can fit in a spark buffer somewhere if you have damage issues on full auto since spark damage buff applies to all sparks after its activated meaning BB order isnt important whereas with crit buffs you need to use it first and could potentially lose damage on full auto if Griff doesnt go first,bravefrontier,czuzc9a,1,t5_2zich

6744690,0,t3_482vi9,Its the opposite EU is more recent. So it has less game modes less units less spheres... overall less content.I think that they both have their pros and cons. It depends of the amount of time youre willing to spend on the game. If you want to play casually I think EU is better. They have interesting offers that allow you to instantly max out your unit. They have very powerful exclusives units that will make grinding and content easier. However some of them were onetime only so you wont be able to get them. And the downside is that they update content very slowly so you might find yourself stuck without anything to do which is boring.On the other hand the global version is a lot more grindy and will require you to invest more time. However if youre willing to spend that much time youll be rewarded with summon tickets in CA tons of rewards with leveling up campaign... And they update content faster so youll have a lot more to do if you want to play it more than just casually.The only downside of global was their poor rateups however with the last rateup they showed some very good results. In the end its all up to the time youre willing to invest in the game. If you want to play casually and have fun pick EU.

6929066,0,t1_d11n99w,Have you tried the Trial yet? I think going through the Trial blind once helps to visualise the flow of battle better on subsequent tries.Cant help much with units too many different buffs nowadays but you want at least  mitigators  with a  mitigation UBB. I can come up with a stepbystep guide though. Cleared the trial with this Gazia Beiorg Armour Heresy Orb  Selena Lexida Celgrad Gem  Elimo Drevas Sacred Crystal  Magress Leomurg Celgrad Gem  Ark Prized Light Fallacy Orb  Zeruiah Reeze Armour Impiety Orb. You want to be able to fill a mitigators BB just by normal attacking. First few turns more precisely Turns  to  consist of normal attacking Lugina and Seria to fill up the OD gauge to unleash UBB on Turn .. Normal attack Lugina first to  HP to trigger his Grand Hazard remember to use  mitigation AND guard the highest ATK unit for the unit to survive.. Bring both Lugina and Seria to  next. Dilma should be summoned when Lugina hits  HP. By Turn  OD gauge should be filled together with everyones SBB gauges. OD Gazia and fill his UBB gauge in preparation.. On Turn  whack them hard with everyones SBB  Gazia UBB. You want them to trigger all their thresholds and survive with your . mitigation. Its now a head on v showdown.. Spam SBB every turn with any ST ones targeting Lugina. With  targets it shouldnt be an issue filling the gauges. Lugina must be down by Turn  shouldnt be possible for him to survive til then but its good to take note or problems will arise. Focus Seria next. Shes a little tougher but shouldnt be an issue. Dilma and Arus will just die in the crossfire no need to worry.. Karl is up alone next. His damage is... Trial  level. Keep the mitigation up just in case but theres not much to worry about. Just make SBB and OD gauges are up by the time Karl hits  HP.. Karl transforms and gets Grahdens out. Spam SBBs. When Grahdens hits his  threshold he will talk and set up mitigation. OD Gazia here. He then talks and sets up mitigation for another turn. UBB Gazia. He then uses Apocalypse Zero. With . mitigation you should survive the turn.. Continue spamming SBB with ST targeting Grahdens. From my experience theres not enough time to fill up the OD gauge a third time for Grahdens next Apocalypse Zero at  which is why a Hero Crystal was used. Once he talks apply same procedure as above.. Once Grahdens dies its v. Take note of Karls thresholds and maybe expect some deaths? but you shouldnt be losing now unlike stupid Imperial Ambition.NOTE Im not actually sure whether . mitigation can survive actually used Magress  failproof UBB. I see that you also have Magress though so if . isnt enough you can always fall back on him.Now back to Imperial Ambition and his stupid Cataclysmic End...,bravefrontier,d11qgpr,1,t5_2zich

6939600,0,t1_d12wzj3,For END Farming Shida works just fine as long as you have Phantom Gizmo  Sacred Crystal on him. For round  you will be doing much more than TK youll just sit and let your OD gauge fill. When youre ready to attack on ANY round youll SBB Shida and then Guard for  turns and hope that he gets attacked at least   times so he has his BB ready on Turn  before his Elemental  buff disappears. Then you can SBBUBBWhatever all of your units and BB shida so he still contributes to damage. Charla has no attack BB so she cant take advantage of this. Unfortunately neither can Shidas  upcoming evolution because he attacks on both BB and SBB and no longer can fill your partys gauges. For Terminus its up to you. You can TK with the strategy I provided and Shidas BB however TK actually gives decent points in Terminus so sometimes you might actually want to just SBB shida and attack with the rest of your party. I would only use Shida and Charla on the same team if you plan on BBing with Shida. Otherwise you are correct the damage and sparking will suffer too much. ,bravefrontier,d12xlj1,1,t5_2zich

Bonnie became infamous across Grand Gaia thanks to the immense firepower of her cannon and her infallible shooting accuracy. Finally having gained the recognition she had so desired as a warrior instead of being forever branded as just another cute face she felt so relieved that she no longer felt the need to fight. However one day as she was passing through a forest she came across a blonde girl atop a giant rabbit who was fighting singlehandedly against a ferocious beast to protect the people of a nearby village. At that moment Bonnie realized that fighting for others was just as important as fighting for herself leading her to unload her trusty cannon to join the battle. She then modified it with harelike speed creating an entirely new machine in a matter of seconds. Legends say that the plasma blast she shot at the menacing beast was so powerful that it completely pulverized the monster along with one of the mountains beyond the forest.

Carrol was in the forest collecting carrots for Bianco when she came across some villagers that lived nearby. As generous as always she immediately offered them some of the sweets in her basket full of colorful eggs only to hear them scream for help. Puzzled at their reaction she glanced past them and saw a gigantic harelike creature covered in a rich brown substance approaching in a frenzy. The sight of the beast surprised Bianco so that he hopped as high as he could causing Carrol to drop her basket of eggs. All of the mystical colored eggs cracked as they hit the floor releasing all of the magical force hidden within and gifting Carrol with unimaginable powers in the process. Fueled by the energy from her precious eggs Carrol faced the ferocious monster by herself until a girl with rabbit ears wielding an enormous cannon appeared to give her a hand. After they defeated the monster the villagers showed their gratitude by presenting Carrol and her new friend with two baskets full of the most colorful eggs they had ever seen.

Its simply a random event in CA in order to mediate the grind so that it isnt endless. Its meant to stop progression as frustrating as it isYour solution is interesting but the underlining mechanic to it is you benefit more from not running CA. The Tier system is based on a leaderboard of active players running CA that day. If say you run CA immediately after reset and are immediately above Tier  youre immediately hit with OFS RNG while those that wait for the morning or even the afternoon can grind freely without fear until Tier  is hit.

7082312,0,t3_4cl4bo,Flaw is that the frametime delay between actions is not as fast and is not consistent between battles. Standard Auto  frame delay between BB triggers.  Is generally very consistent in timing very rarely see lag delays This allows you to trigger every BB before say a BB Fill action occurs Febros SBB will always apply fill after everyone has used BB. New Ordered Auto  frames delay between BB triggers.  Timing is NOT consistent Febros depending on position will fill SOME of your BB gauges and depending on random lag it will be inconsistent between battles.So you can set your nice autoorder but you cant perfectly predict the frame sparking anymore because the units dont use their SBBs at the same exact frames.This is still a very nice update but because of the timing change it wont allow us to have nearperfect spark FGs anymore.,bravefrontier,d1j5945,4,t5_2zich

Of course this was just two runs so I cant really say which is best yet. Now for the BB management question sadly Allanon still didnt refill on the Rameldia wave. To be fair both runs had the  spark dmg boost instead of the BB one.

Theres about .The top  look like this for animation speed  Gildorf    Leona    Mifune DE    Zephyr    Cyrus    Mifune     Rouche    Atro  Out of those Mifune Atro and Zephyr are capable of pure normal attack farming Zephyr actually needs a high ATK lead like DE Mifune or a Magress set to guard so youd generally mix him with Mifunes anyways and Gildorf requires manual fujins with any method.In global Hailes LS provides enough BC gen and damage that any of the remaining units equipped with a hit count sphere can be used for Nyamistyle Equip Sky Harbinger  Hit Count sphere autoquest. In JPBF you cant set a second unit to guard so this isnt useful  itll only work for units that dont need a LS for enough damage such as Cyrus.In terms of speed of actual runs pure normal attacks saves  seconds over Atros BB regen method which saves about  seconds over one turn of normal attacks to fill BB gauge methods. In which case the method is the most important part and the list of speeds looks more like this. DE Mifune Normal attacks. Zephyr Normal attacks.  Mifune Normal attacks. Atro Normal attacks.

7298386,0,t1_d27oo34,Im using older units for you because you are missing a bb on hit unit.  The idea of this squad is to maximize bc gen to reliably be able to spam SBBs on autobattle.   Rhoa L hp bb on spark LS spark dmg element retype Griff crit chancedmg on SBB element retype Sareas bc fill bb on spark SBB iSBB spark blanket Sargavel status curenull on SBB spark blanket Aaron def buff bcturnWith two spark blankets and RhoaGriffAaron having decent animations and  BC on spark between Rhoa and Sareas you should be fine for BB gen on most content.  On top of that you have bc fill per turn between Aaron and Sareas with Aaron being able to BB as well to help fill even more.  The only critical buffs youre missing are bb on hit obviously and BB mod.  However between the awesome sparking and  element retyping you shouldnt be hurting for damage.  Oh and healing... you only have Sargavels BB which is really weak.  So if you are finding healing necessary sub in Elimo for Aaron.EDIT Once Allanon gets his staff sub him in for Sargavel.  That will fix two of the above issues for you if youre willing to manually use Allanons BB.,bravefrontier,d27rz6h,1,t5_2zich

7331041,0,t3_4frzxs,Hi returning player here looking for some advice on where to get started. Feeling overwhelmed with all the new features and shiny new units that BF has had since I left. For reference I left somewhere after Feevas batch got released.From what Ive seen now powercreep is still very much evident in the game or even worse than before but apparently gimu has taken some steps to address summoning rates and unit types? I come from those days where they just added units into the pool without increasing rates Feeva batch and Id spent  gems on pulling for my Elza  only for her to be an Oracle which was a death sentence for any minmaxer those days. So question is  are all my old units outdated? Ive spent some time over the last few days doing a couple of pulls and evolving some of my units selena to  lunaris shera to  etc. Some of the units ive pulled are Gildorf Sareas and Berdette just to kickstart my adventuring again  are they worth raising?Whats with the new arenas? And wow theyve made ranking up so much easier now... TrialsGGC  I know what they are up to Cardes and the  starters I think? There are so many nowWhat are Grand Quests? Are they worth doing for rewards?Abit of an odd question  whats the meta right now? Is there something along the lines of a Zelnite craze back then with his insane LS and BB for that time?Thanks for any advice. I cant post units and spheres right now but can get around to doing it later if need be.,bravefrontier,d2bhmm8,1,t5_2zich

If you wanted to pick from those listed units for leaders Elza is probably out since she doesnt give HP but if you can make it work she is obviously the damage option.I would go for Tridon or Allanon as defense leads Allanon if your party is suffering from elemental weakness or otherwise Tridon for the flat  damage reduction on top of his bulkiness. I considered Lafiel but Allanon gives a bit more in return for not negating crits which from my experience havent really done me in.I dont know what kind of other units you have but personal favorite leads of mine are Omni Eze for damage or Mikael for defense and that sweet status negation. Theres a lot of great leads out there nowadays and I have RNG to thank that I have most of my wishlist filled out. But no JunoSeto. ,bravefrontier,d2ctsvb,2,t5_2zich

7344205,0,t1_d2ct6h9,Bring a singletarget nuker with you like Hadaron. Personally I wasnt confident I could OTK him from full so the idea was to get him down to  activate OD before popping his Foci shield so that he fills it for you then drop everything on him. First the squad Avant L Gazia Hadaron Vermillion Nyami Guest Avani GuestYoull need to take advantage of Avanis LS and alternate sources of BC due to BC drop null at certain thresholds. The important buffs to bring yourself are the following BCturn BC on hit Def buffs. Avani already covers spark buffs for you and comes with BC on spark on her LS. Nyami can cover crit rate buffs if needed. For lead bring a high damage lead. Avant is best for this since his LS comes with HP but Zedus or Nyami could work though prepare to use a couple of revives depending on RNG.For items bring a hero crystal and make sure you have  fujins minimum for safety.Turn  open with Hadaron for crit buff then Gazia BB if youre using him for DEF buff then auto. Chances are thisll shave off enough to put him on OTK reach next turn but will trigger his Foci Shield giving him  mitigation BC drop null and fully drains your BB. This is where Avani will shine. Use the augmented hit count buff and spark well to refill BB gauges. Next turn OD Avant then use as many BBs you can and normal attack with the rest. Thisll trigger Foci Overload refilling your gauges and getting rid of his mitigation and BC null. Use Fujins to refill anyone not ready to SBB open with a crit buff then Avant UBB then SBB. This should finish him off.,bravefrontier,d2czhgs,1,t5_2zich

7541376,0,t1_d2zet8m,I dont know the exact location but start from the wings to the lower body. Be careful of your damage because like uTthecreator said you can OTK Laguna Rex without focus targeting sometimes,bravefrontier,d2zf28z,1,t5_2zich
7541591,0,t1_d2zcc8v, Well st of all I have read that u said that KM is immune to all ailments and thats correct it is immune to all but attackdef down they are debuff not ailments anyway so dont worry to use an status inflicter nor a curer because he doesnt do any ailment neither. Another important thing just to clarify that point if KM uses its double bb drain that follows the next turn with that nuke aoe  bb fill rate down and u kill it before he unleash it he will do the follow st turn buff clear nd turn nuke aoe charge idle rd turn unleash nuke  LS lock and all that stuff so charge ur ubb right after the buff wipe and use it so u dont get LS locked. I didnt use magres for any fight but used my Krantz instead labert for leader  krantz with sacred crystal rc sphere that gives u bc per turn and phantom gizmo  all stats bc per turn bc on hit sphere was most than enough for the fight u get mitigation dark element buff and cure in just  unit I did A LOT of runs and its really hard to not have his bb gaugue full every turn just need  hits from  bb with BC on hit buff to get it full every turn although its not  guaranted this is just an alternative for magress... Labert LS do wonders here his  mitigation after k damage received its just perfect for this is hard to see a unit die with this even after  stage . In stage  if u have Selena with the sp option for better hot u wont need to cure every turn even if ur units are in red if u are using labert or a  mitigation LS after damage received but will need the rec buff this is for certain stages of the fight where its impossible to use Krantz SBB. The big nuke with LS lock from the second stage IS NOT TURN BASED it have something to do with OD gauge... And Im sure about this because KM gave me more turns in every cicle if it is not  based on OD gauge  then HP  based but it dont follow a turn count. At final stage idk why but he atacked me after the last nuke... With  HP... He tried to kill my units again I ataked him and after leaving me just with ark that survived thanks to his angel idol buff he died... That was really weird... Proof  For ark ex stage... The single target nuke its for units with high stats so be aware which units in ur squad have the highers ones for me was my friend most of times so it ate the buff wipe every  turns only exception was the first  nukes after that was my friend with no fail u can plain acordly can test st just to be sure if u want. Ark in my case LOVED to use his ubb and justice right after that to counter that I got to use tilith ubb twice... Magress can cover it if u dont have tilith... This is logic thing but just to be sure for second turn fujin tilith and let her fill all ur bb gauges if u can use her be sure to put every light unit a sphere to null elemental damage cuz it hurts A LOT. If u cant use an DE ark friend with null EWD sp option. If u have tilith use just her SBB dont use her bb if u need to cure and dont have any other unit to do it then make the exception but try to dont use her bb her SBB will give u nice bulk will fill ur bb gauges to max or almost max and will heal u to max. If u are using tilith use her bb to break that damage reflect from ark u have to do more than  spark in order to break it so  spark or more if u dont he will do bb gauge fill rate down to u and a nice aoe and that hurts a lot in this fight her bb have  hits I guess and they really help that is another exception to use it. One last thing and a VERY important one ark is vulnerable to injury and that helps A LOT in the fight it reduces its damage a LOT and if u proc atack down and injury its guaranted that his painful normal hits will do u  damage I can say that a leader that helps u to proc injury on it would help better that almost anything to reduce his huge normal attack damage and some aoes damage and of course will help u a lot surviving the nukes...I think thats all Ive pointed out in my endless tryes xD I hope it would help some people here... Edit formating.Edit  read that KM is immune to attack down... Im pretty sure that I proc him attack down a couple of times BUT when he already got debufed itself... So double attack down... ,bravefrontier,d2zfxx8,2,t5_2zich

Shera feels a little weak in the defense department and often dies quickly for me.  Attack order is important as buffs can override each other even if one is stronger than the other. So attack order is important to maximize efficiency of your units.  The other part of attack order is achieving perfect spark. This is when two units that move have their damage distributions line up exactly.,bravefrontier,d3oefyn,1,t5_2zich

Trust me when Reproc of BbSbb seems op only on paper.Still  reproc rate with Ubb seems very strong can be very useful for nuking when it procs.

Probably if they take the sealed powers literally and dont let you use units you own during the new arc its gonna be The Summoner fighting along with hisher friends luginakarlseriaetc. or guest characters i doubt they remake the whole fight mechanic just so you can solo everything with The Summoner from what i read of the last Nico live it seems that the Summoner will be another unit.    Need clarification because at first i remember that Alim said they wouldnt want to make a Summoner Unit because it would be weird to summon yourselft but in the last Nico Live they talk about him like an unit with bb and SBB.,bravefrontier,d3tjvih,1,t5_2zich

7868164,0,t1_d40ewr2,Nyamis single target damage portion only benefits from ATK so youll want to make sure none of her sphereselgif boost BB ATK and of course any major ATK boosts help a lot as does spark damage. My Nyami carries Sky Harbinger Sacred Axe and the HR Elgif for  ATK and  spark damage to make sure her ST damage is as high as possible.It may also help to set her autobattle slot to SBB only in case shes not filling to SBB sometimes as thatll prevent accidentally getting the crit buff.If it still fails like that your squads damage may simply be too high for Nyamis ST damage to make a difference against the  crit rate. If youre willing to do manual play you could take a hit count buffer and spend a turn ST nuking via that to get ahead of the damage requirement but otherwise youd just have to swap Nyami out of the leader slot for Eze when doing Estoreit raids theres multiple squad slots so just have a nocrits squad next to your crit squad and swap before clicking the start raid button,bravefrontier,d40gdho,2,t5_2zich

Id recommend Azurai or Vern for more damage but Laberd if you find yourself having problems with survival. You may want to use a Selena friend so you can take Estelle instead. Also OE Selena should be able to finish the quest even if everything goes horribly wrong thanks to her Angel Idol ES... XDEdit Sorry I keep thinking of things after posting. For Mecha Gods Azurai Vern Laberd Estelle and Layla really would be optimum Layla because some of the fodder units can use status ailments but the Mecha Gods dont.

7962708,0,t1_d4b160d,Yes shel function well in raids As for the build  whatever buffs your squad needs. Youll probaably want mitigation so choose between the other  buffs  RECgtDEF better HoT BCHC drop rate or Ailment Null. Of the four improved HoT and BCHC drop rate are the only ones no other unit can match  but in HoTs case its also the smallest value for SP and the drop rate boost isnt much over  buffs.The last  SP will go towards either the LS boost or the BB cost reduction and the DEF passive if you cn afford it after that. Just ask yourself whether youre going to lead with her or not.Its worth noting your squad is losing a lot of BC gen by dropping Selena so you might need to replace that functionality if you werent already double stacking it. Of course Juno is replacing two units so you dont need to use her SP to get your BCHC drop back from Selena  you can slot in a new unit with it.,bravefrontier,d4b31nz,1,t5_2zich

7972522,0,t3_4oflwx,Cyan is probably running for the most pointless unit right now and this was already the case during her releaseFor unit like Fadahl you can arguably find a way to use them through Ailments and Damage reduction because ATK down is pretty much unresisted outside a very specific scenarioCyan is a Spark buffer with BC on Spark. On paper this doesnt look bad but then she had a quite crippling animation. Then if this isnt bad enough at her release time span Spark buffer is defined by their Leader skillsee Rhoa which gave you the BC on Spark you need. Then we had Chrome and Charla to doubled the issue by providing a super convenient BB on Spark on SBB levelAs a result you get probably the most pointless unit you could ever raise  whatever you could get from her you can get by from using a Spark Buff Leader from friend and call it a day. She actually had it worse than Ragaa who is much older Oh and then Seria comes and drive the nail in really hard. ,bravefrontier,d4c6qgk,8,t5_2zich

Hes kinda weird like thatFor the squad itself Sakura Miku is only there because she perfect Sparks Ensa but come to think of it she cant really be replaced easilly for her convenient skill packsmaybe Azurai?. Nyami had the strongest damage Leader skill and she used UBB for auto Sparking. Mifune is bar none the strongest nuker in the game. Ensa Taya offers the UBB and one of the easiest to perfect Spark. Allanon is for EWD and is core for breaking through the higher bracket because of EWD.This is done through UBB buff stackingAnyway from my speculation the highest possible should be Fire because they have Rineth Lune Vargas and Avant. At this rate the only way this can be optimized further is to find a way to implement high EWD one critical leader and a Spark LS while having all  Sparking well and all of them Dark ElementsLune is the best EWD and Rineth is a Fire EWDLunaris and Shida somehow scores worse than Allanon,bravefrontier,d4vute6,5,t5_2zich

8182214,0,t1_d4zytem,Note dont use a crit rate buff on the whole squad unless youre using a bunch of StSBB units or normal attacking. Hadaron and Charla actually buff the whole squad with crit rate just as a heads up Gumi doesnt mention this in their SBB info but its there.Also while using Nyamis SBB double check that she isnt getting too much crit on the body since shell be attacking that too. With bad RNG she could be taking body and tail down at the same rate. You may briefly want to pair a hit buffer with normal attacks on some of the other units Rahgan Avani or Berdette for instance if youre not using an additional StSBB unit and fear their SBBs might take the body down too fast especially if any of them are water units. Your squad might be fine but its best to doublecheck in case this is the problem.,bravefrontier,d50brv9,2,t5_2zich

It was not clear exactly when and if Omni Krantz doesnt come out many people wont be able to complete without FeliceTilith lead.

8261026,0,t3_4skp7n,Honestly they were not underpowered during their release time spanElaina was the most consistent unit for FH grind BB filling because of her BB and was one of few Status Null units back in the day in  era. She also have HoT and Status handling on her BB to make it all the better. For comparison Diana have BB on hit in place of HoT and Shida have consistency issue that the only time Shida is  consistent is when we have Phantom Gizmo x Sacred Crystal with Gazia SBB during Gazia Ark Zedus Griff Shida Zerafalgar eraThis is a niche that ended up putting Charla as a staple for FH after almost half a year. Elaina ended up getting overdone by several great status cleanser in the meta that comes out post Will legacy batch  Andaria without Bow almost killed her completely with no strights attached and the whole  month of great status cleanser coming from JPBF  Melchio  Sargavehl gt Lunaris gt Reeze Grandts is just an ATK down with damage and this kind of unit isnt underpowered by  era with units like Ruby Rags and Fadahl aroundadmitably the later two is a butt monkey for  era and Ruby is only good because of animation and UBB but honestly ATK down is super underappreciated. Being able to attack on ST and AOE makes him able to focus target on raids and his BB had massive ATK down before buff. Grandt have been buffed to  chance to inflct  ATK down on SBB which is the same level of ATK down of ZedusHis Leader skill is actually fine because contrary to popular believe you dont need to have Crit buff to become a good crit leader. Golzo is one of the best Crit buffer and his Leader skill is literally Paris CloneReally they were good during their release time and shouldnt be compared to the SBS who was basically  cost units in disguise that got released  months later. We dont really complain Bestie is underpowered because Klaus and Atro make Bestie look dumb. ,bravefrontier,d5a6pv5,3,t5_2zich

8360863,0,t1_d5mbieh,Merith Pearl gives  all stats  spark and  critical damage and  BC cost.Blighted seal gives  ATK equal to  SBB modifier and  critical damage.ampnbspBoth spark and critical damage are likely to be stacked to a high level naturally   Crit gets     base  from Avants LS x  SP optioncrit damage buff   Spark gets    base  Avants LS x  spark damage buff from OE spark bufferSince their absolute values are largely similar we can consider the addition of either stat to result in similar proportionate change  spark would be largely equal to  crit.ampnbspThat being said though Blighted Seal has a higher total  because of proportion the mix of  crit and  spark in Merith Pearl will outweigh the additional  critical damage from Blighted Seal.   This is the same reason why Nyamis LS gt Sakura Mikus though Miku has a higher total  number.Adding a spark damage secondary sphere into the mix will however tilt the argument in favour of blighted seal because now we have an additional  spark damage that reduces the proportionate damage the  spark damage applies.However critical damage has a  of being applied crit chance cap unlike spark damage  with perfect sparked Avant and also runs into the problem of the crit damage cap  should you UBB Avant.ampnbspTLDRgg Merith Pearlgt will yield a more consistent damage output in all scenarios as long as you have perfect spark.     As long as your secondary sphere has minimally  spark damage Blighted Sealtt can beat Merith Pearl in terms of damage per run  but your output will be more inconsistent due to the  chance of not critting.   Since youre likely to perfect spark Avant and considering how Avants SBB isnt nuketier it might be better used on a unit who doesnt spark wellsparks a small proportion of hits so the  damage sparked is low e.g. FeliceZeruiah. If you UBB Avant Blighted Seals critical damage is completely worthless because he easily already exceeds the critical damage cap without Blighted Seal unless you run single Avant but there should be no reason for this.   HP from Merith Pearl shouldnt matter for UBB purposes with double Avant leads you get minimally  HP already which adds  SBB modifier for a total of       .     Rize only needs  to hit the ATK cap and her base attack is lower than Avants.,bravefrontier,d5mnrl9,1,t5_2zich
8361182,0,t1_d5mmh5w,Some tips due to the bugBC on hit buffs essentially end up turn.  So you really have to make sure to use those every turn.  Whether its Atro Kuyluk or whatever.    Kuyluk with heal  bc on hit is popular because these are great to use every turn.All buffs that you need to be up when he is attacking are basically down from  to  turns  def BC on hit HP on hit etc.All buffs that you want at the end of your turn go from  to  turns so BCturn HoT ATK buffs BCHC etc are all effectively  turns.  So you can do something like use an Atro or Kyluk with BChit  heal every turn and your Selena with Bcturn BcHc buffs every other turn.  This is why Juno is so great for this while the bug is up  A whole bunch of useful buffs up every turn when mitigating healing and BcHc etc.Krantz is good too offering a bit more than Magress and easier BC management but without a def buff up all the time.,bravefrontier,d5mp76v,1,t5_2zich

8403717,0,t1_d5ry54n,Krantz and Dolk should be your priority. Theyre both great mitigation units and Krantz has an OE form for the future. Dolk is especially handy as a lead but Krantz could serve in a pinch. Youll want to switch between them depending on what you need most. Lance is another priority. His  isnt great but his OE is excellent and hell have some great synergy with Dolk. If you have cost for it you could create a legit team out of OE Lance  Dolk  Libera  Rosetta and...  Andaria for SBB autoease although if you use her sphere have Libera go after her or  Toutetsu for his attack buff and for regular Arena in particular. Admittedly since Lance cleanses Andaria isnt as necessary and much as I love Toutetsu hes kind of outclassed and youre better off taking  Ciara for the most part shes also great for quick Parade runs and Arena.If you have any Sirius friends Nadore isnt worth focusing on. Rina is a good source of ailments HoT and BC on hit though. Shes still useful until you get a better unit to handle any of those.If you want a mixed team Id say for general purposes try Ciara Rina OE Lance DolkKrantz Dolk for def conversion and Krantz for elements  burst heal and then who ever you feel like honestly. Id say Rosetta might be your best option especially if you can find some better BB attack buffers in your friends list but spark buffers are also really common.Griff and Kuda are both outclassed at this point but if you need crit for whatever reason theyll serve you well enough. Kuda also has the convenience of attack and BB attack buff which will help since he has to go first anyway. Karl is also outclassed but you might want him for Water Gate eventually I dunno. Grahdens is still a good  but I dont know how much effort you want to go to just to level him up right now. Gildorf would do fine if you need a nuker. In general anything that goes to s could still have its uses but the oldest ones are the least useful and anything more recent is generally better.Ultor and Tridon arent bad but... theyre not meta anymore. Plus Ive heard barriers may interact weirdly with Tridons shield in a bad way for the barriers.TLDR  OE Lance  Rina  Ciara  Rosetta and  Dolk or OE Krantz. Best lead options are OE Lance Dolk or Rosetta. OE Krantz is good but not with this squad.Edit I forgot you dont have a very high cost but thats a goal to shoot for and I think other than Lance and Rina being much less useful in their lower evolutions I still recommend getting Dolk and Krantz raised up to  at least. You could even use them on the same team if you wanted to but its not necessary. Rosetta  is still one of the highest spark buffs on that level and Kuda is probably more generally useful in his  form than Ciara. Let me double check some things...At  cost you can take the entire team I recommended with KrantzDolk at . Id say until then either drop Lance for another dedicated cleanser or rely on DolkKrantz to clean up for you. Alternatively run OE Lance OE Krantz  Ciara and  Rina then rely on friend helpers for BB attack and spark buff. Im not sure how well that would work out but those are some options and you could always swap Ciara for Rosetta as needed. Ciara is the most easily replaced if your friend has BB attack buff and no spark buff.You can of course play around with some other units and skip the OE for now but since the meta is going all OE you might as well get a headstart on two of them IMHO. Lance will be phased out eventually but only if you can pull someone better from rare summon so until then hes golden for his stats and his general kit. Having an OE mitigator also means that Krantz has better odds for survival but Dolk is still strong if you really need def conversion hence my recommendation.Heres a useful link if you want to tweak my suggestions. Also feel free to ask about anyone I didnt mention. I recognized most of them but not everyone.,bravefrontier,d5s0dy2,1,t5_2zich

8565417,0,t1_d6c6kt5,Welcome to Brave Frontier!You will learn as you dive further into the game that there is no one squad fits all. Each area of the game has certain kinks that make some unit buffs superior to others. For example the angel idol buff is pretty niche and unreliable in trials and raids yet it is very meta in colosseum. For questing most  stars and up can afk autobattle almost everything. You may want to bring a status cleanser so that you dont have your whole team perma paralyzed. Kanon Reihard and Layla fit the bill nicely. Early game you may want to consider slotting in a BCHC buffer for quicker BBs and kills in quests such as Julius or Feeva. Mid and late game content has a lot of BCHC resistant content however so I wouldnt heavily invest in them. BC on spark is more reliable for BB spam in all levels of content so Zeal would be a good option as well. As you try harder content you will need more types of BB management and survival buffs to continue fighting. Mitigation is THE most important buff to have in the majority of BF content. Unfortunately you lack any mitigators at the moment. There is one free unit named Magress who gets  turn mitigation at his omni. In the vortex the Scarlet Abyss Tournament has a chance of dropping him on the first stage so definitely try to farm him if you have the extra energy. BC on hit is another very mandatory buff to have. Kula Klaus Nadore and Layla cover this buff. Healing is also important. Selena and Layla have heal over time and Layla has burst heal as well. There are many more buffs that you will need as you go but as you learn more about the game and read guides you will find that there is lots to do.

8652392,0,t1_d6mysj5,He does have a lot of buffs and sure he synergizes well with units like Elza Sirius etc.  However my priority when building a squad is covering all crucial buffs in a few units so I can pack in damage dealers. Unfortunately when I look Zelnites buffs I see BC on hit and a burst heal. BC on hit is a pretty common buff and burst heals arent rare either. I know that in the good old days BC drops were the only source of spam and BB fill rate boosting LS were always the way to go. But times have changed. BC on hit became an extremely important buff during the  era because raid and trial bosses gained BC drop resistance. Then spark BC came along as a buff and became equally important. When we got advanced autobattle we gained the ability to spark units consistently and strongly and now were at the point where I can keep my squads gauges filled against one target with just Elzas  spark BC and some BC on hit. The exception to that is when BB fill rate debuffs come into play. Karna Masta was my most notable experience of this. I was using Krantz and Atro so I had BCHC drop rate buffs and a  BB fill rate buff. It did nothing. The BC drops werent good enough and fill rate buffs only work for BC drops so that was pretty useless too. I guess his BC fill is kinda nice but thats not rare either. Ive rarely found it useful but my Elza has it if I ever need it. As for the burst heal with double Ark leads and a tristat buffer I can get more than k hp from one standard heal so to me they pretty much are full heals. And HC wont save you from DoT HoT is the only counter to that.Basically my point here is that most of Zelnites kit is negligible to me and its easy to cover his buffs that matter. But lets say all his buffs are useful it doesnt matter to me because I can cover all of them along with all other crucial buffs in four units. Thats because besides his BC on hit all of his buffs are just little extras for other units. For example nobody is using Krantz specifically to get his BCHC drop rate buff its just a little extra. I dont use Atro specifically for his BB fill rate buff or Ark for his burst heal theyre just little extras. Zelnite is a unit made almost entirely of these little extras. The problem isnt that he doesnt have buffs but that he has a ton of minor ones that I wouldnt use him for and can already cover without trying. I wont get too into the Zenite vs Felice debate but my view is that Felice gives the important buffs while Zelnite gives the needless extras.Damn didnt think Id end up writing an essay about that. I hope that explains my view.,bravefrontier,d6n5v4k,1,t5_2zich

Lara is sadly probably the only irreplaceable unit for this strategy.Equipped best SparkCrit focused spheres and ATKCritSpark focused ElGifs. Still need at least  HP on all units or they run the risk of being one shot. Lara had some BB Fill spheres just to insure BB available on Turn  of Stage .Strategy is very basic STAGE  Chaos Control Support TK first round TK every other round STAGE  Item Set TK every round UBB Izuna on turn  of the th and th stages but STILL go slowly for TK   Izuna UBB required to survive  turns on th and th stage its clutch Use Flute the turn you UBBThe guide recommends bringing Orna instead of Izuna but I found Izunas ATK Down and UBB way more useful. NOTES Lara is mandatory for this strategy how dumb. Silas and Kuda will eat your face with Crits without her. And you may not be able to use a friend for it either unless you have great SpheresElgifs to compensate.

I only started on spheres recently so im trying to bump up all my legwands and stuff to higher percentages spheres.gt Im still at odds over selling all of the materials or if Ill need them for other spheres.Ive given up on this and decided to try to keep one stack of each material. I figure if I get more than a stack its easily farmable if not then I wont be wasting any. it requires dumping a lot of my gems but its worth not spending so much time trying to micromanage it as you said checking what crafts into what in the wiki is just too much.gtkeep all the spheres? keep all the spheres!yeah. I dont like getting rid of any. I got rid of one probably useless onetime super lowtier arena sphere back close to when I started but now I just look back and think i did that to make item inventory space but Ive increased that by like  since then that was such a waste. on the positive side theyve been trending towards making stuff reavalible if its needed for new stuff and its been ditched by some as seen by stuff purchasable in guild shop ex past vortex arena units certain spheremats the lion regalia yarn ball thing comes to mindgtcleared his trial by accident yesterdaywat gtendless FG.I wonder what the farthest someones gotten is? Also I wonder if theres a point where the timeetc needed to progress is more prohibitive than the unitsstatsetc. I really do need to get around to getting all those sweet trialFGGQ spheres and stuff.gtailment bosses AvantHAHAHA its always so cruelly satisfying when you stunlock a boss. then theres the chance of ruining the sense of satisfaction from clearing it legit tho gt.gtgtRCI actually remember hearing about the Luly vs Bieorg strat but I wasnt about to raise her for something I wasnt even getting around to normally.

On my first run to Terminus I got pretty decent scores I would say.Entrance  Middle End TerminusAfter that Ive went to farm in Terminus at the time I did not know that End would be better and I never beat that score sure I might have been lucky so I decided to go search up the internet but all i found was that end would probably be better.I went to do End and I got only over a million. I didnt even have too bad of rooms all the rooms were decently around  with probably a single exception and there was that much of a difference in score.Right now Im pretty stuck on what to do so if you guys could be nice enough to stick me up with some advice?Note that I did roughly just start and been playing for around a month and a half so i dont have much units But this is what I do haveOmni Krantz Kulyuk Nyami Rize Zero Azami Selena Dolk Lara Eze Diana Charla Maxwell Allanon Magress Avani Zenia Trial Units MifuneVargas Owen Avant gonna raise him since i see him so much Claire Griff Rineth Lune Noel Lance Lario Zelban Dion Tora Rahgan Julius Atro Raaga Nadore Sirius Lunaris Yuura Grahdens Reis Laberd.Got quite a bit more but itll be too messy so just ask and Ill check if I have the unit I just mentioned those that seem like may possibly help.Ill raise my units if need be getting them mecha gods on the Weekend to evo some.,bravefrontier,d7op6o1,1,t5_2zich

8988566,0,t1_d7rq2fi,gt Im not defending the fact that Gumi lied what Im saying is does this change really hurt players?Yes because it means that we can no longer trust Gumi when it comes to their promises.  It means that paid players can no longer spend money with assurance that they know what theyre getting into.More people can get a useful unit from this sure but that comes at a steep cost for the games future.  Its not like how they lied about say KampK getting a  form which was at least a free unit attached to a game mode people did anyway for gemstickets because people spent money and in some cases a large amount of money on a promise that Gumi proceeded to wipe their asses with and shove in our faces.  Why spend money on this game when they treat players with such contempt?  Why support a company that openly lies to its customers?  Maybe you dont care about a companys honesty and integrity but a lot of people do and this has the very real chance of hurting profits in the future which will bite everyone in the ass.,bravefrontier,d7sacsu,2,t5_2zich

9024198,0,t3_53sswn,Edit Attack order changed. The format was copypasted from another post and I forgot to change the order on original submission.Much like my FemFG OTK squad this is a relatively RNGreliant squad and most of the points will come from the first nine stages with the last stage a likely wipe.Lucius Clear HS .M  Variance .M  .M  Lucius Wipe HS .M  Variance .M  .MSquadSpheres AvantL  DandemagusMedblare   AvantF  Sky OrbSacred Axe   Lauda  Purgatory VerseGolden Lion Regalia   Lauda  Demon IgniterInfidelity Orb   Daze  AmenonuhokoHeavenly Bud SparkCritCrit   Krantz  Phantom DeviceVirtuous CapeAn HP sphere is recommended for Avant and Lauda as they lack an HP SP option. Dazes Amenonuhoko is better off replaced with a DMG sphere that isnt timelimited or a bulky BB management sphere. Its ineffective for the Lucius battle and I forgot I left it on her.FormationOrderAvant  |Lauda    |  Daze  |Lauda    Avant  |Krantz    AlternativeAvant  |Lauda    |  Krantz  |Lauda    Avant  |Daze    This formation seems to spark better but all my tested runs so far have ended with a wipe with this squad. Thats what I get for playing around with Spark Boost instead of Final Hope I supposeBoosts Round  BB Boost gt All others.   Round  Final Hope gt Spark Boost  Item Set gt All others. BB Boost will ensure most units will have BB up during the Stage  OTKs.   Final Hope is the best insurance against Afla Dilith and Lucius. The hitcount boost is also great for BC production.   Spark Boost can ensure an OTK for rounds  and  and will also facilitate BB management throughout the whole of Round . However you are significantly more susceptible to wiping at Lucius.   Item Set will provide emergency revives as well as Fujins to get Dazes SBB up during Lucius second phase and for any endstage UBB nukes.HS Run Notes Given the singletarget nature of this FG I feel it would generally be more reliable to use a trialesque squad rather than a sparkreliant nuke squad. As such actual scores have a large margin for variation. Since every battle is a single target throw out everything you know about perfect sparking. The target attack animation location moves around every time and cant be accounted for in simulation.The Laudas will spark fairly well against each other... cant say much for the rest. Ill be playing around with this FG until the end of the event though so Ill be updating if I stumble upon any suitable formations.   BB Management For the most part the Laudas and Krantz should be able to consistently maintain their SBBs. The Avants and Daze are a mixed bag.   Stages  I took BB Boost to help stage . Juggernaut aside you should be OTKing.   Stages  Final Hope happened to be there  and it was a goddamn BOON against Lucius I wouldve lost three units during mid second phase otherwise. For the most part TK the Four Fallen Gods.   Lucius Again Final Hope was a boon. Without it Id probably have wiped at  second phase. The DEF buff from Dazes SBB is helpful if you can get it ready.,bravefrontier,d7wkfk9,1,t5_2zich

Its safe to get rid of any that only give boosts when you are under a certain HP.  Generally keep ones that give flat  stats with no conditions and Boosts to spark damage.

9418432,0,t3_59nfyc,Galtiers definitely worth pulling for so consider him before Ciara at least.But if youre considering skipping Ciara because shes permanent theres the issue of her not being eligible for standard new unit release gates  shes  minimum rarity and will not appear as a noise pull in Divine Summon gates aka all new RS batches and LE gatesChoices eh? But seriously if you want Galtier at all roll for him first. Ciara will start popping up in popular units and limited pool gates after a month or so. Galtier might not be back til next halloween and he could well be irrelevant by then.Quick thoughtsGaltier LS is like the halfway point between Juno and Terry so hes going to be common in the colloseum. Its not really practical anywhere else. ES just furthers him being a nuisance in the colloseum. Also BB Angel idol and stat buffs. Pretty sure hes metatier collo at this point. Hes a Melord tier ATKgtDEF buffer on his BB but its not shared on his SBB so you need to play manually with him if youre doing content.  But his whole BBSBB kit is pretty insane  just at base level BBOD insta fill  ATKgtDEFDEFgtATK  angel idol k barrier and selfbuffs. Never mind that theres enhancements for more stuff too. As for his UBB  mitigation and revival and k barrier? This things going to get used a lot in difficult content. As for builds it seems like you want to focus o his stat buffs but just remember DEFREC is a mildly common pairing youre likely to clash with the DEF buff. Also as his primary role is defensive you probably want to maintain the BB buffs  as youll cast BB first for the ATKgtDEF its likely preferable to put the stat buffs you want on BB only.  This also means the standard content build will have BB buffs for colloseum which is good.  OD fill rate buff is pathetic at just  especially on a burst OD filler  it doesnt really change anything.  General builds look to be either  Content build Focus on the ATKgtDEF conversion add ATKDEF buffs to BB depending on your squad comp and have some defensive passives to fill the remaining points  Collo build ATKDEF on BB LS enhancement  SP of passives Ele immunity  HP   ATK or DEF or LightDark mit   ATK or DEF Before I move on just a nod towards the HP damage note on his BBSBBUBB. This works like Noahs SBB  whenever you fire the BB theres a chance to deal  of the targets base HP instead of regular damage. In RC that leads to some fairly exceptional damage as  is the entirety of a midtier squads damage output against Kielazar per turn  Galtier can potentially do it as a single unit. Shame theres no info on the proc rate though  Testing shows the HP scaled damage replaces regular BB damage so its a net damage loss against trash monsters and in the arena. Do note however that you can spark these hits to increase the damage beyond just  for raids and HPscaled damage is not affected by elements or crits.Ciara Basically Fire Ark but dropped all of the defensive stuff for uh BB ATK and ATK down. LS is strong for nuking if EWD works  ATK  EWD is fairly strong. As it has  raw ATK its also good for converts She gets some strong selfbuffs but with her low base modifiers shes not exactly going to compete with a dedicated nuker. That said she covers multiple important roles in a nuking squad and can still have above average personal damage  but you wont be using her BB  ATK spark in OTKO content because its not on her SBB so realistically she only has whatever SP passives you give her resulting in a unit with average BB mods and  sparkcrit. Her buff kit is solid but Im sure people have already started complaining about yet another BB ATK buffer but seriously that makes  fire OE BB ATK buffers.  Elements  ATK  BB ATK  EWD is a decent kit. If you raid with her the optional ATK down is really solid as well.  Also interestingly she has good sync with Gregor  between their SBBs they cover every important damage buff that cant be applied retroactively theres a bit of overlap between Ciaras BB and Gregors EWD but in OTKO you only use SBB on both. Sadly this puts a bit of strain on the rest of your squad for slotting in OTKO leaving  slots for LS spark damageBC and Rizes. Maybe what we want is a unit with crit chancedamage spark damage and spark BC in one package. Her UBB outdamages Avants in a perfect scenario i.e. every effect relevant. The drawbacks? Shes likely your only element buffer so in OTKO using her UBB means not getting element buffs on that turn. Also her EWD is more resisted and harder to use than Avants spark damage making it less viable overall unless you know exactly what youre using it for luckily most of the time youll have Avant in the same squads in content you can use a crit damage UBB in On the plus side we dont have to pay for  BB ATK. Arguably speakng the only mandatory buff in her build is LightDark elements and depending on your squad makeup you may have that covered by another unit Krantz As for passives to ignore  the BB ATK passive is expensive and minor cant be converted so only take it if youre doing a nuke build and actually have those points spare. The ATK buff you can add to BB is generally pointless as she gets that from her SBB which you should be using first in most scenarios. Two general builds come to mind  a nuke build involving LightDark and the offensive passive buffs and a utility build involving the ATK downs LightDark if you need it and then some passives again.Ill do more in depth... eventually.

9418642,0,t1_d99unuj,I dont see why people are comparing Quaid with Ciara. I mean both serve different purposes. You cant compare them just by saying Oh look they both give FireWaterEarthThunder elemental buffs. Lets look at their buffs and decide whos stronger!. It might work in the  era but not in the OE meta. Every unit is unique on their own and they do not outclass each other.EDIT After looking at their kits again closely I would say that Quaid is more versatile than Ciara because his SP options give him a variety of buffs to choose from an all element buffer a Spark buffer a CRIT buffer a Burst Healer etc while Ciara is more offensively geared and defineitly looks like an unit you would bring for Cruise Frontier. In addition she is also a great ATK down inflictor AND her ATK down buff pairs well with Ensas RT as well.,bravefrontier,d99vmbm,5,t5_2zich

Hell you can drop Elza for Tazer and Rize if its a raid boss potentially. Then you have three targeting units one of which will never hit the other parts and two who will make up for that. All you need are attack attack conversion maybe a burst heal and other BB support and youre good. I,bravefrontier,da3gzyu,1,t5_2zich

9841854,0,t1_daqefcs,Its not technically a nerf. Crystalsgods simply give different amount of exp when fused to regular units compared to weapons they are different parts of the game. You cant fuse kingsghosts to summoner weapon.Alim has actually already buffed the amount of exp gained from crystalsgods to summoner weapons once. There will be more rebalancing to come.Theres also the point that research lab is the most efficient place to level up summoner unit compared to regular quest. However you are limited by how much ST points you have so its best to make the most out of it given that leveling weapon from fusion is still faster than grinding summoner arts from quest.,bravefrontier,daqf0aw,2,t5_2zich

9893298,0,t1_dax1eu4,Heres some good reading. Its actually more accurate to refer to it as the ATK cap rather than the damage cap. As far as I know normal hits are not restricted by the ATK cap. However with the setups we have now normal hit nuking cannot beat BBSBB nuking methods.,bravefrontier,dax4c04,1,t5_2zich
9896938,0,t1_daxdu9l,Of the  units is that really the only usable units you have?If so I agree with uilwb and would reroll just to get the gems. Theres an x EXP event going on and if you join a respectably casual guild with  EXP boost you can get back up to  in a month. However because the FFBE event is over I dont think you can get the free  unit and the Ultima sphere which is actually a huge thing to have early game because she essentially carries you without needing to summon. Then again its not a big deal if youre smart with your gems and summon during a rate up. Getting even one good Omni will carry you a long way. If you do restart pick Eze because they give you a free Selena from the Summoner JournalIf you dont want to restart then evolve Ciara Zelnite Shera Darvanshel and Raydn. Theyre not amazing units but they will at least be a well rounded team to finish content until you get stronger units. I doubt youd be able to beat Grahwens trial to get Grahden to  but if you have an Ensa friend you may be able to cheese it if youre lucky,bravefrontier,daxlf42,1,t5_2zich

10077928,0,t1_dbl5ukw,Lara can only be made into a  turn mitigator so you cant really swap Johan for her unless you change avant into a mitigator.  Lauda is generally a very nice unit since he does good damage and provides bc on spark which is generally a strong bc gen option.  So lets see what Avant actually provides which is mostly crit rate bb spark vuln bb attack and a hp to attack convert.  Lauda covers the bb atk already so mostly he provides a convert to attack and spark vuln.  Those are not really the greatest of buffs and he doesnt actually nuke that hard himself.You could actually take Avant out for that Lara and itd make more sense I think than swapping her in for Johan.,bravefrontier,dbl6b4l,1,t5_2zich

10788614,0,t1_ddrzksx,Oh I fully understand the mechanics of all of it. A  Ares buff equates to one BC counting for . BC meaning if a unit has a BB cost of  they will only have to aquire  dropped BC in order to fill that portion of their gauge. When you have  Ares one BC dropped counts as two BC collected. My entire point is that between BB fill buffs mainly BCSpark you often have mostly filled your gauges back to full. If you havent the twoforone BC from the LS helps quite a bit. Follow that up with BCHit buff to top off anything that didnt get filled. All in all there is no good reason to not have full BB gauges with the exception of severe BB fill debuff  Geniuses Challenge level in which case unless you focus entirely on BB sustain youre not going to be SBB spamming anyway. ,bravefrontier,ddsron2,-1,t5_2zich

Alternatively you can just spam the  dungeons some combination of  times since those are auto friendly the obvious downside being this is far less efficient energy wise.    The harder dungeon drops  guaranteed orochi seals up to  if youre lucky enough to get Kyo he drops  each twice as a miniboss. Even getting Kyo once is rare dont count on him showing up often and then  random elemental seals depending on which characters show up.  The auto friendly dungeons drop  orochi from Leona and  of the other elements depending on which one you pick. ,bravefrontier,debqjit,1,t5_2zich

11032165,0,t3_5xf0tu,I appreciate the game mode in that it encourages guild members to interact and work together.The mode itself is long grindy with everything boiling down to a war of attrition.  The guild that fields a bigger army wins.  Smaller guilds  not much chance even if they have a core group that is very active and effective especially with the scoring system and the outpost dynamics SO unbalanced.  I cant see many smaller guilds sticking with this game mode going forward in the long term.  Whats in it for them to be a punching bag for corporate guilds match after match?I agree with almost all the suggestions.

I really loved her art and I used her a lot in early content clearing  unlike what people say useless buffs irrelevant etc. Iris getting DE which is sneakily good and not worse than Vargas like Ive heard before and arguably the nicest animation in the entire game is something that really pleases me.Meanwhile in Global Ive cleared pretty much every trial and EX dungeon with her in the squad except for Bectas EX and Vilanciel EX   Iris of course and will continue to do so with much more ease once her DE is released.,bravefrontier,dfca0pq,2,t5_2zich

11351997,0,t1_dfipk5i,I didnt play through the third arc sadly but if we do get an armour as weapon for summoner chances are it would be something that branches the six armour series. Michelle carry a piece of DuelSGX to the new world which is the summoner first area so maybe we get to have her own version of the six armour in any future map cause i remember that any GLEX content is noncanon making Wannahon armour is invalid. Dont think Wannahon stole Blastoise cannon cause Grass type Wannahons cannon is energy based Blastoise will get literally incinerated by Wannahons arsenal if they fight together XD,bravefrontier,dfiq7pr,1,t5_2zich

11363752,0,t1_dfk0w5r,Hmm okay. Firstly thank you for your attention. Its just a feeling that I occasionally felt that this subreddit in particular has a strong bond and faith between the mods and the regulars and while this fact alone isnt something to be conceived as something negative if anything Id take it as a positive sign that the mods are relatively easily communicable it sometimes did feel like some of them are shifted towards a certain userbase that isnt really the representative of the whole BF Players. This used to be just a feeling that I had in mind until this incident popped up and became like a realization of my groundless fear.From your explanation Im glad to know that the mod community is a collection of different perspectives willing to talk about it rather than being dictatorial. As you said yourself I hope this megathread will resolve my fear and reflect your future operations as a whole. Cheers.,bravefrontier,dfk25pm,1,t5_2zich

11412325,0,t1_dfphh38,Rayla isnt really that huge of a help sadly.  Your omni potential units are...  Elza Ciara Shera Belfura Zelnite Kanon Rize Zellha Kira Krantz Alice Feeva Mifune and your starter units Vargas Lance and Eze. I believe I see youve already evolved your Avant. At some point down the line Kafka Griff and Lilly Matah will also get omni evolutions but those are months or more away from global.  Krantz and Shera are the most notable of these omnipotential units for both are mitigators and via some SP options at omni level can give a  turn mitigation buff among their other effects.  Zelnite Kanon Feeva and Elza are also very useful omni units Id recommend avoiding Feevas spark damage buff SP options and instead picking up at least her BConSpark SP option and whatever else you want Elza and Eze are good enough for spark buffing until you summon better ones.  A generally decent team could be something like Avant lead Feeva Kanon Krantz or Shera Elza and whoever you pick as a friend unit.  Zelnite is a great leader for item farming and expgain while questing though.  A team with him probably should be more like Zelnite lead Krantz Feeva Elza Avant or Kanon or whatever and whoever as friends probably another Zelnite or Zeruiah for even more EXP and itemdrop gains.  For summoning... I would recommend against the sorts of gates that say you can only summon  star units usually they are  gem gates but lately theres been a promo making them  gem.  Otherwise... resummon gates usually are the best at having chances to get specific rate up units since you have more chances per ticketsummon to get something you want. Regil is considered one of the strongest units currently and isnt available for UoC so rate ups with him also may be better to focus on than ones without him.  For UoC... You probably should look to other people for advice as I dont know who to say    ,bravefrontier,dfpkqep,1,t5_2zich

11708965,0,t1_dgn8796,Upon the original release for these  different wording was used when marketing them. There was one Gumi source i.e. Forum or FB etc. that said that they would never come back to the summon gates. Since then there have been far more LE releases and rereleases so the understanding of what LE means has become clearer. Additionally upon the first rerelease of these  they got rebuffed so that there was an excuse to bring them back. They havent done this to any further rereleases of these  though.So Ill only ever be a bit annoyed about rereleases of these . Any other LE batch that comes back and I wont blink an eye.Everything that youve said is valid Im just offering why I believe that this specific batch is a bit more controversial when it comes to rereleases.I could really do without more Junos in colo though although the release of Zalvard diminishes this fear somewhat.,bravefrontier,dgn8oou,4,t5_2zich

11752810,0,t1_dgrxa0t,Yeah no. Hitting cap is is irrelevant on a unit with no passive spark damage. Eze hit upwards of k on a standard team without UBB for reference. Azurai cant be dupe sparked and nobody with a good unit pool ran a spark blanket for him over another nuker. He had a niche for FG but not FH. Even there the better option was to run another nuker and let Azurai spark as much as possible with the rest of the team.Hes far from a second best option now. Neither full auto teams nor guard frontier teams use him. Nobody uses any of the units you listed for FH either. Hes only useful for full auto FG.,bravefrontier,dgs7l78,3,t5_2zich

11768758,0,t1_dgtzsmq,Colo not so much unless youre wanting to deal more damage.  The problem with putting it on Mifune is that it doesnt boost hit initial damage it just adds another hit which is more likely to trigger a threshold AI.  I use the hit count elgif on units in the arena and for units that will be using normal attacks a lot ex. impcrystal farming.,bravefrontier,dgu0pqe,1,t5_2zich

I have gathered a lot of units and aimed to get the ShionRegil team combo. I dont know of any other unit combinations that would support the above two famous units without clashing buffs.I tried running with Savia ShionRegilL Krantz and Melord.I wanted to add in Gabriela andor Adriesta but Gabriel also has an HPgtATK buff which Regil has that would clash and I believe Adreistas conversion buffs wouldnt work either. I think I should look more into my  Cleria and Ionia. I think Agress could be a very good BB manager. I am also thinking of using my Allanon .I want to make sure I could finish off Magress before he can summon Selena for that annoying Angel Idol and Eze for his crazy damage.
