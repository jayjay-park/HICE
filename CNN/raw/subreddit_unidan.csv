9722501,0,t3_5dir7b,Well he wasnt really smart honestly.  He seemed smart because he intentionally used alts to punish people who disagreed even when he was wrong in scientific discussions pushing them down into the negative numbers  or  and himself up by a similar margin.From that point the reddit hivemind takes over and any positive reading or interpretation the other comment could have had gets quietly ignored and discarded and the community pounds the other guy into the ground but discussions would never necessarily have got that polarised if he wasnt deliberately manipulating the perceived consensus to make it appear that way in the first place.If theres one thing we absolutely know for a fact from how he tried to manipulate the truth through his new account with his smug apology in which he tried to blame the admin that caught him.. Its that his persona of a helpful guy who only wanted to post comments and was merely followed around by a large and vicious fanclub that punished dissenters was a complete facade.In reality he was intentionally manipulative and quite deliberately started many of the downvotebrigades that buried people who disagreed with him.,unidan,dabidvo,2,t5_2xhhs
