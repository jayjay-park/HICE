1738553,0,t1_cjyatal,Well i think there is room for all theories at least until we are able to prove that one is more likely then the other. I am in the camp of Bigfoot being a real animal but i dont mind listening and considering the other opinions even the paranormal ones since we cant yet disprove it. I dont think it discredits those of us who dont think its likely. ,Cryptozoology,cjyb4cf,1,t5_2qyez
1742217,0,t1_cjyquo3,There are images of some South American tribes and animals taken by John Lewis who is alleged to have found the dung  so he certainly did go to South America  but there are oddly no images of the dung itself.John Lewis own website is a single page with about ten ads and one enter here button which leads to an Error . It also seems to have given me malware.Ive sent him an email but I doubt Ill get a response.EDIT  his email isnt even valid apparently.,Cryptozoology,cjyrowm,2,t5_2qyez
