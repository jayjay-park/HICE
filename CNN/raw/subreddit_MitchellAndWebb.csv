1230433,0,t1_ci80wyk,The League of Gentlemen for one. The only downside is a lot of the jokes characters and plots from the radio show were reused for the much more popular TV programme so fans of the TV show who listen to the radio show afterwards may find it a bit repetitive to listen to.,MitchellAndWebb,ci81ht7,2,t5_2s71n

2035379,0,t1_ckyj09d,Sorry. My mate sent it me on fb and Ive only had Reddit for like two weeks. I didnt know it had been posted before and I didnt get it from here. Look at the imgur link. Its different because I uploaded it myself because I didnt know where my friend had got it from I couldnt find the original picture. I never tried to pass it off as something Id made. All credit obviously goes to the guy who made it.,MitchellAndWebb,ckyji5f,16,t5_2s71n
2152730,0,t1_clde3jy,I think it looks good you could probably make that dimple or whatever it is at the end of his nose more pronounced. Also I think Davids eyes are a bit off. Just the way the iris is only touching the top eyelid. They never really do that they are always dead center and dark lol. ,MitchellAndWebb,cldglh5,3,t5_2s71n
2276046,0,t3_2laf11,Its not all that memorable but I certainly dont regret watching it.  The comedy was consistent throughout and I was never bored.  It gave me several good laughs.  It has some very funny bits in it.  Based on the other comments here it sounds like maybe I enjoyed more than everyone else but Ive recommended it to my friends and they enjoyed it.  I think David Mitchell got it right in his book when he called it an enjoyable flick to watch while eating a bowl of popcorn and nothing more Im paraphrasing.,MitchellAndWebb,clt1dlp,6,t5_2s71n

5720654,0,t1_cx5mm4c,Im reminded of what Graham Linehan tweeted recently about Ferris Bueller  that Cameron was the true hero of the film because of his ability to change whereas Ferris never changes. Perhaps we are seeing that Jeremy  and not Mark as most wouldve assumed  is the true hero of the arc of this series? When he broke down crying when talking to the cultist and said I havent got a ing clue what Im doing was a truly touching moment for me and a moment of geniune honesty from Jez. Could Mark ever have this depth of feeling this desire to change? I for one love this development.,MitchellAndWebb,cx67c3n,7,t5_2s71n
