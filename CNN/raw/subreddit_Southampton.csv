2858913,0,t1_cnsqz6q,I am from Southampton living in MK. Driving here is so much better I dread driving around Southampton when visiting family. The city centre is especially bad particularly down by the Isle of Wight ferry. I also find that Southampton has gone quite downhill and rough looking in the past  years. I grew up around SholingMerryoakBitterne and dont feel particularly safe alone in any of those places. Walking alone in MK is fine but some of the underpasses are awful. A lot of the crime Ive heard about happens on the bridges around the city so maybe secluded pedestrian and cycle paths arent the way forward!! I have also lived in Newcastle so the nightlife in both MK and Southampton seem dire to me. Im not a clubbing person though so my opinion there is invalid. I do find the shopping and entertainment facilities are much better in MK and Newcastle compared to Southampton.,Southampton,cnt2581,1,t5_2s06c
