5698,0,t1_cef1i1c,Looks like all youd need to know for that particular sweater is a cast onbind off knit and purl stitches and probably some sort of increases and decreases. It looks seamed so youll also need to learn that as well. Id suggest making a hat first preferably one knit flat since itll give you practice at all the stitches other than increases that youd need. Ive found the videos on Knitting Help to be the most helpful.Edit Heres a bunch of free hat patterns on Ravelry I set it so theyd be knit flatseamed and using the same size needles as the sweater you linked.,femalefashionadvice,cef33a0,3,t5_2s8o5

19314,0,t3_1ucc3w,Great work! I love this. Im just going to add a few little things Ive learned working as a flight attendant about packing in general.Most airlines will allow you to check a bag for free but if they dont dont bother. Pack a normal sized roller board suitcase  inches long no bigger and bring a big backpack or other squishy bag for under the seat in front of you. This is absolutely key thats an FAA rule two carryons per passenger and one must fit in the seat in front of you. Dont try to get away with putting two bags up in the overhead. In your roller board pack your shoes and clothing that could wrinkle exactly like this guide says. If you know that youll have access to an iron most hotel rooms will have them then roll your clothes up nice and tight and you can fit way more. In my carry on once I brought two pairs of jeans four pairs of leggings five pairs of tights seven different tops four skirts two sets of workout clothes shorts and a tshirt and three sweaters along with a weeks worth of underwear and socks all thanks to the rolling technique and the iron in my room when I arrived. But you dont need to bring that much on vacation! I was going to flight attendant training and was going to be living in a hotel setting for five weeks so that worked for me. So after you pack your roller board you have to pack your other bag. This is where your laptop and everything miscellaneous should go books kindle extra socks and underwear medications snacks and accessories like jewelry. Dont waste space in your roller board where you could squeeze in another pair of shoes or something. You should also throw in your toiletries bag just make sure that everything thats liquid is in its own little bag or you will end up with lotion everywhere. Trust me. If youre going to be somewhere for a while just buy shampoo and conditioner and anything else toothpaste hairspray etc. there. Dont try to bring giant bottles of stuff it just takes up room and you cant carry on anything larger than  oz. If you are checking a bag and want to bring your bigger bottles of liquid go ahead and put it in your checked luggage but I cannot stress enough make sure its all in baggies! Im going to copy and paste here something I wrote earlier about skincare on an airplane. Lubriderm is your BEST friend. Seriously. Apply liberally. I bring a bottle of that and all my makeup in my personal bag and leave it where I can reach it during the flight. Get a little  oz bottle and fill it with the lotion from the big bottle so you can bring it in your carry on. I reapply my makeup every few hours after wiping my makeup off with Neutrogenas makeup remover wipes and putting on more lotion. I also keep nail clippers with me because my nail beds get really dry when I fly and I get hangnails really easily but I dont think youre allowed to bring those on the flight. Other than that Chapstick and wearing fuzzy socks are your best ways to be comfortable on the flight.Other random final thoughts Dont wear tight clothing during a long flight you will bloat up due to the change in pressure and youll be SO uncomfortable. Wear your heaviest jacket and use it as a blanket if youre sleeping buckle your seatbelt over your jacket so the FAs dont have to wake you up. Dont wear jewelry and go through security youll just have to take it off if something sets off the metal detector. If I think of anything else Ill add it here ,femalefashionadvice,cegmrfk,90,t5_2s8o5

161563,0,t3_1vwzxt,Im assuming that since you dont like wedgies thongs are out.  Theyre out for me too.  The cottononly rule complicates things a little bit but not too too much.  Basically I would look for boy or girlshorts with no seam up the frontback which for me is worse than even thongs for wedgies and lace on the leg openings to smooth them down to your skin.  Gap has these from time to time although not at this minute unless you forgo the lace.  Maidenform has a lot of synthetic materials but if you can find something cotton from them their underwear tends to be very smooth to the skin.  Generally I think that as long as your work pants arent EXTREMELY tight in the thighs you should be able to get away with seamless girlboyshorts quite well lace or not.,femalefashionadvice,cewu2gy,1,t5_2s8o5

My wardrobe is primarily Ann Taylor Express and A. Eagle for jeans... some pieces thrown in from HampM J. Crew Urban Outfitters as well and I gravitate toward neutrals and muted tones.I have this pair of bright violet tights I thought was a good idea when I was . I still have no idea how to wear them... And pencil skirts are a little too mature for me right now. I dont know how to wear those casuallyoutside of business casual setting.Im currently trying to figure out how to make drapey sweaters work on my body.  something like  They all make me look like a tent but I want to diversify my style so I have some younger more relaxedlooking options...

A black pump with a almond or pointed toe would be a very classic look. Its pretty simple but sometimes simplicity is nice. You could also wear a more adventurous shoe in terms of color and style because the dress itself is pretty simple.

While that store is not exactly in your budget being really good about searching eBay can get you some really great deals. I would recommend going to the physical stores to try out the clothing see if you like it and then nail down what size you are. Then when you get home you can use eBay to stalk sales. You can even save searches so that new items that pop up that fit your search criteria are emailed to you.You might also check www.liketwice.com to search for preppy clothes its an online consignment store that tends to sell some JCrew clothes among many other brands.Other than that a frugal notsosecretsecret is to make friends with a GoodwillSalvation Armyetc near a rich neighborhood as these people are much more likely to donate nicer clothes.

352399,0,t3_1y2o9e,I have a similar body type but I am presumably much shorter and with slightly larger breasts and I find that skater dresses look awesome on me...maybe they will work for you? check it The reason they work for me is because they emphasize the part of my body that I like my bust down to the smallest part of my waist and can be belted at the smallest part which camouflages my poochy areas. The main concept that works is flatter the areas you like and do what you can to camouflage not cover up necessarily problem areas.I am also a fan of the  length sleeve vs the kimono sleeve. I know its easy to gravitate toward the blousey stuff but truly the more fitted not to be confused with tighter the better you look when you have a larger figure. I agree with the other poster who said ditch the floral tops. If you do want a looser fitting top go with something very structured. If you can work a boxier top go for that. Be sure to pair it with a skinnier pant.Try patterns that will lengthen you geometrical blocking or interesting seamwork vs allover prints when possible.,femalefashionadvice,cfhakwn,3,t5_2s8o5

379813,0,t3_1yewml,I know you asked specifically about the Lo amp Sons TT but since the materials are the same I can offer a little insight into the Lo amp Sons OG which might be helpful. Since you seem to be looking for a slightly smaller bag I think I would maybe recommend the Lo amp Sons OMG which is slightly smaller than the OG.I have an OG and Im really pleased with it. Its nylon so it is really lightweight. This was nice when I was lugging it around airports several layovers for a TransAtlantic flight and on little trips around the UK. Im looking to go to Ireland soon to see my sister and Ill definitely bring this bag. It has a spot for my laptop iPad magazines spare shoes several pockets for passports etc... and I think the quality has been good. I currently use the bag to lug my stuff to work and though Ive only had it since November which isnt too long really... maybe someone here has had one longer? it has held up well. Im sort of rough on carryall bags and there hasnt been any fraying or cracking. I did spill something oily or greasy on it in a small and not so noticeable spot but I accept full responsibility for that ha.As far as your list goes if youre open to the OMG as opposed to the TT it hasA key strap. Its in the front and outside pocket and is pretty easy to access.No water bottle compartment but if you really wanted I guess you could stick a water bottle in the shoe compartment at the bottom... which may or may not be a good andor convenient idea.Cell phone holder in the outside compartment there is a place for cell phones etc... There are also some more pockets in the main part of the bag that would fit cell phones of any size.There is a crossbody strap on the OMG. Also it has regular straps for you to carry it as a shoulder bag. I used the crossbody strap for my OG as crossbody and a regular strap. Its convenient and you are right that it is rare in larger bags.Color choice pretty good. I have the dark purple and my sister has an OMG in navy. I do like my purple but the navy is really nice... but as far as colors go honestly I like DDs choices better. So pretty!Back in November I had really wanted to get a DD but as soon as the review showed up on Reddit they were all sold out and the waitlist was just too long for me. While I think the DD bags are beautiful I am glad that I got a LampS. It has more of the features I need and is a pretty lowmaintenance bag for work and makes a great carryon. As an FYI I also thought about the Michael Kors Jet Set bag but kind of dismissed it. I was glad I did because a girl seated next to me on the airplane had loaded hers up with a laptop and because of the thinner straps she had massive marks on her shoulder from it digging in. Hope thats helpful for your decisionmaking even if youre looking at different bags!,femalefashionadvice,cfk4stg,12,t5_2s8o5

426171,0,t3_1ywk9f,commenting here as opposed to making a post because Im finding it really difficult to navigate through all of the beginner info and guides and dont know if its okay to make a full post about thisSo I have very little knowledge about fashion in general especially womens fashion. Im  now but thanks to a crazy fast metabolism and a lot of early development Im practically the same size I was when I was  just about  lbs heavier in the boobsbutt area mostly. Because of this and my only if I need it attitude towards shopping Ive hardly bought any new clothes for myself in the past  years and consequently dont really have much style.I really likewant clothes that fit me well not that I want super snug formfitting clothes I just want something that emphasizes and shows off my figure and curves. Yet I constantly have issues with trying to find OTR clothes that fit me properly especially more structured tops as opposed to knits with more give and pantsjeans. I definitely feel like Im pretty curvy but according to all of the sizing charts I see online for clothes apparently my  figure  and  lbs if it matters is pretty standard. So why is it that so many tops especially buttonups gape and pull way too tight around my bust while still being too loose around my waist and I can barely squeeze my hips into dozens of pairs of jeans that are still way too big around my waist?So I guess my question is less about actual fashion advice and more about finding clothes that actually fit me. Right now a big part of why I havent really tried to develop my own sense of style is because whenever I try to branch out and try on something other than tshirts I get all frustrated and emotional over how I try on literally dozens of different tops dresses and pairs of pants and I get the exact same fit issues with every single one almost.So all you fashion experts what am I doing wrong? Is there a certain brand I need to look at? Are there any resources on how to narrow down whether or not something will even come close to fitting especially if Im going to have to do any shopping online? Im just so totally lost on just the basics of finding clothes that fit me that I cant even begin to concern myself with actual fashion so I really hope you guys can help me out here. ,femalefashionadvice,cfoxrte,1,t5_2s8o5

456075,0,t1_cfr1ktn,I recently turned down a humanities PhD program after initially accepting the offer. I knew when I accepted there was a chance I wouldnt end up going but I kept hoping that magically Id be able to stomach it because I too had thought it was what I wanted. I actually started panicking as soon as I was accepted to schools and obsessively read up on attrition rates and Googled career paths for PhD dropouts. Clearly shouldve taken that as a sign. Now the whole application process and subsequent school visits are a distant memory and I work in a completely unrelated field at a stimulating job that I like most of the time.Its absolutely okay not to know what comes next and you shouldnt tie your self worth to your degree it took me a long long time to get over this. At the end of the day if academia were like any other career path its what I would choose but its not. I decided I couldnt give up the freedom of location and I didnt want to take the risk of going through a  year program with a very good chance of not ending up in a tenuretrack position and with a salary thats probably lower than what I currently make.,femalefashionadvice,cfs3s4f,1,t5_2s8o5

As long as you have enough extra fabric where the two sides of the skirt overlap you can adjust the cinching of the belt to your size. Also adding leggings can keep you comfywarmappropriate in terms of length.I think this look would be easy to keep more trim and less tentlike. Something like this this  or this These are maternityspecific examples but you could also try nonmaternity dresses in a larger size.Perhaps you can find some similar designs that are more shirtdressbased to work in the menswear?

534572,0,t3_208qch, Sell everything you were planning on selling replace with pieces you truly like. I would say you are definitely an hourglass as far as your measurements go but also seem to be more bottom heavy than top heavy weirdly. So i guess you could focus on both of those body types in regards to fit. if you are looking for a staple white shirt that will last and you plan on wearing a lot go ahead and spend the money on a more expensive one. In fast fashion stores like Forever  you may find what you are looking for but it is really a cheap copy that will only last a few wears. Say you wear the white shirt  times a month. A forever  shirt at . the average cost of their more opaque and better fitting shirts and will cost . per wear per month while a BR shirt at . the average cost I found online will cost . per wear per month. This seems like a big difference until you consider that the F is not built to last and will likely last you around  or  months of regular wear before it begins to fall apart or grow thin while the more expensive shirt could last years. As you continue to buy a new F shirt every few months the cost per wear doubles and triples. By the time you have replaced the shirt three times you have already nearly met the cost of the BR shirt.In general a  will be a  shirt. You get what you pay for. You probably werent considering buying a forever  shirt as an investment piece but I would definitely say that Banana Republic is on the low end pricewise of quality tshirts. They do get as low as . normally and often are on sale for sub. I like American Apparel tees as well.personal experience. I had a Banana Republic t shirt that lasted  years through highschool of regular wear without popping threads or anything while my Forever  shirts rarely make it to the next season much less the next year. But YMMV. ,femalefashionadvice,cg11d1v,2,t5_2s8o5

So that might mean that wearing sheath dresses really is out because they are so restricting movementwise. On the other hand one function of a sheath dress is to give others the impression that I am serious adult and confident.

669254,0,t3_21t3s5, No. I did consider buying a pair of slim harem pants because they looked comfy but I decided against it. They dont look good on me anyway. I think theyre more for outdoorsy people although Anatomie has a shirt dress that I like. I like to display enough fashionsense that I feel comfortable in what Im wearing. Meaning I like looking like I took a bit of effort dressing myself because that makes me feel comfortable and relaxed. I would never ever travel in a ratty tshirt and yoga pants on a flight no matter how comfy they may seem because they make me feel selfconscious and insecure.  My standard goto would depend on where Im going. I have a standard list for a beach vacation a desert vacation and a European tour vacation. But the one thing I always bring is my trusty crossbody bag.  Theyre fine if youre going somewhere cold but a terrible idea for the tropics especially if you cant do laundry.

671795,0,t3_21ufjf,Ive lost  lbs over the course of the last year. Ive had to buy clothes mostly pants to keep up but Ive tried to be as thrifty as possible until I reach my goal.

For casual clothes Ive been waiting until theyre hanging off of me but thats just not acceptable at work. Its been very frustrating to have to replace things every two months or so. It has also become slightly overwhelming to shop these days because I used to be limited to a much smaller selection of clothes. I will probably be at my goal weight at some point this summer and at that point I will have to reassess my needs and will hopefully have some money saved to actually recreate a functional wardrobe.

675556,0,t3_21vi6e,Dont wear leggings or anything that has no structure.The more structure the outfit has the more professional it looks.Try and mix and match similar tones that suit your skin colour and haire.g. Blonde fair skin blue green teal pink navy gold and silver. Piece together some accessories that also compliment those tones as well.Also being discreet in what you wear is very important making sure your outfit isnt too sexy and appropriate cleavage is shown. Same goes for length of clothing.If you choose to wear denim go for the two extremes of it really really dark navy blue denim whitecream or black is always a good ideaNever wear anything that is tattered or ripped regardless of how much you love itBe careful with prints decide whether they are too young or too old for you and be very careful with this. Try not to wear your hair in plaits or pig tails. Keep your hair style simple.Although I dont believe makeup is necessary you can put some on but whatever you do do not make it too heavy less is better in any professional aspect.Although it is a casual look you are going for I always feel that if you overdress everyday by about  then people always have a better impression of you. Regardless of whether you have good work ethic or not people who take pride in their appearance are respected a lot more. Also dressing better than everyone gives you better self confidence.,femalefashionadvice,cgh27g0,5,t5_2s8o5

700162,0,t3_225a3h,Your post makes me really sad   I think this is tied up in two thingswomen who intentionally dress sexy are asking for it especially if they are known to have intentionally had sex in the past and being pregnant is a  indicator that you have gasp had sex.  Shocking I know.  As someone else mentioned your husband probably thinks hes protecting you and your new baby by telling you not to dress sexy.  I wonder if he would have been comfortable with you wearing it to go out with him and not just with your ladies?  Either way I think the dress looks super sexy on you and if you feel confident and awesome in it you should absolutely wear it!  If it wouldnt make you feel trashy and inappropriate if you werent pregnant you shouldnt worry that something has suddenly changed just because you are.  Pregnant women are women not just vessels for incubating innocent babies and they shouldnt be held to weird aesthetic standards.

Im  work in a science lab and am petiteget told Im  if Im not wearing adult clothes and a blazer.I dont know how biz caz you go but in the summer Ill often wear ankle pantschinos with a silk button down or other button down with the sleeves rolled like utomlizzo suggested. Even just the ankle open helps for some reason. Sometimes I cheat and wear dressy shorts with a shell  cardiganblazer... I still look more put together than the nike shorts crowd but I get some relieve in the summer heat. But you may not be willing to go that casual and Im guessing if skirts are out dressy shorts are going to be a nogo too.Sometimes I feel more profession and polished with a nice necklace one... Not like a screaming statement necklace but a nice string of pearls or something. From your style description it seems like that could fit in with your wardrobe.Im assuming if you have to occasionally meet clients you probably wear makeup... but coming from science life I know I dont always make the effort. If you dont always even doing easy nomakeup makeup can make you look a little older if its too hot for the blazer.IDK if Im really saying helpful things beyond I feel you since Im super tired right now...

804736,0,t3_23cu2c,One of the first things I can say is you need to do a bit of soul searching to figure out what style you enjoy. Have you looked into pinterest? Its a great way to aggregate looks you like.Unless you are ready for a giant upheaval take this slow. Jeans tend to make people look younger especially light wash jeans which seems like the majority in these photos. Another thing is fit if something is too baggy itll make you look like a child. Your grey shirt is great in my opinion add dark wash jeans and a patterned scarf with nicer flats This  or   and youll look more grown up for running errands or grabbing some coffee with friends.Dressing like a women has a lot to do with narrowing down a personal style to avoid looking like your wearing an amalgamation of other peoples clothing.What do you like the look of on other people itll help people in this thread help you more?,femalefashionadvice,cgvr33b,8,t5_2s8o5

839252,0,t3_23qbjr,Asian person. Androgynous facial features. No makeup. Large blackrimmed glasses often because contacts make my eyes dry. Skin is light tan from sun exposure. My hair is thick stick straight and dark brown. My pattern is to chop it all off into a really short pixie cut and then let it grow until it reaches my butt. I think not wearing makeup really affects how clothing looks on me. When I have short hair I can look like a dude in a dress and so interestingly androgynous fashion makes me more attractive. With long hair dressing like a guy makes me look like a kid. I look a lot better in feminine fashion. In general I stick to skinny jeans and a tshirt.

897388,0,t3_24d0lt,Born and raised in the north. I never owned any fleece underwear but I definitely invested in Wigwam socks for the winters growing up. Also scarves. A lot of other people have mentioned them but they really are a life saver. When I moved to England I found Barbour whose scarves which are really nice quality and very warm you should be able to find them in the US or on Amazon. Their jackets are also really nice and good quality but theyre pretty expensive and you can buy a warmer coat for the same price elsewhere.Personally I was never big on mittens or gloves I always got snow in them so I just gave up but I bought a pair of leather gloves from Macys shortly before I moved abroad and they were great. Just make sure that whatever you do buy is lined and the same goes for boots. I prefer equestrian brands Dubiln and Middleburg boots for instance and wellies but whatever you decide to get just make sure that . Theyre waterproof or can be treated to be waterproof and . That theyre lined and warm. Between the rain and the snow in the winter youre going to want to keep your feet warm and dry.Always layer your clothing. Wear an undershirt or use thermal tops and insulators from sport brands like Nike or Under Armours Cold Gear for your base layer. Buy some thermal leggings and some sweatpants for when youre at home and chilly too. Invest in turtlenecks and cozy sweaters. You can usually find warm sweaters for cheap at most thrift shops in the north or go to Old Navy for one of their knits which are surprisingly warm. ASOS usually has a large collection of sweaters in varying styles and pretty much everything else you can think of too.I cant speak for GorTex but The North Face really isnt worth it. You can find knockoffs everywhere my mother bought one in Cape Cod this past autumn and she wore it happily through the winter as a layer. It cost her all of  bucks as compared to the  she would have paid for the North Face name. I know someone else already mentioned it above me but check out LL Bean and look around at other lifestyle brands including the equestrian brands as there are some great coats and warm gear for riders on sites like Dover Saddlery. If you plan on going skiing check out Dicks Sporting Goods. Youll find a lot of gear and apparel there.Oh! And one last thing I dont think anyone else has mentioned it but keep your noggin warm! Buy some cute hats or head warmers or earmuffs. ,femalefashionadvice,ch6ad4z,2,t5_2s8o5

904209,0,t3_24gxs0,I dont really know what your style is like but people here often suggest getting wrap dresses as you lose weight  you can pull them in tighter as you get smaller which buys you a little time. They actually used to have pretty cute ones at Old Navy so theyre not too expensive. Theyre feminine but not ridiculously frilly or anything so theyre pretty neutral as far as dresses go.Looking for sales and thrifting are your best bet  it also feels really nice to have at least a couple things in your size even while youre losing weight   months to wear baggy clothes is a long time. Plus wearing things that arent the right size might make your weight loss less apparent when you look in the mirror which can get discouraging speaking from experience.,femalefashionadvice,ch72b7l,3,t5_2s8o5

Ive found some AMAZING stuff in Goodwills over the years and its significantly aided my weight loss journey.  Losing and wearing toobig clothes sucks.  Losing and wearing things that fit and flatter you makes you want to lose MORE.  Beyond secondhand I just stuck with TargetOld Navy for the first  lbs.  As you near your goal weight the loss slows down and its mostly body recomposition so its easier to predict sort of what size youll land in next.  Oh!  And get fitted for bras.  Regularly.

923322,0,t3_24oti2,I find the textured detail of the wedges to be rather casual compared to the formality of the dress I would be more likely to pair that dress with a classic neutral pump or high strappy sandal. A lot of that depends on your personal taste though. A shoulder cover for those sorts of necklines can be tough I prefer something g drapey and shawl like rather than something with structure that will fight with the pleating at the neckline. I have a good sized silver silk shantung evening wrap that Id wear with it but we are too far away for you to borrow it. With that neckline Id keep accessories simple but definitely there. A plain but substantial silver collar for example. Something that wont fight with the pleats so nothing that hangs really low but you will want something to fill the space between the neckline and your face. Same feel for the earrings. Its a lovely dress navy blue has become a really underused colour these days especially for evening. ,femalefashionadvice,ch98jqq,11,t5_2s8o5

Women are good at knowing different names for shades of the same color. Vanilla oyster cream whatever they are shades of the color white. look at it and think would say a  year old man or a  year old boy call it white? if its that light and neutralish then yeah dont wear it. Not everybody is good at telling apart shades things can look different with some artificial lighting or photo flashes and  photographs also might not get white balance right and risk making something look much closer to white than it looks in daylight.The mint looks definitely colorful I would say fine.,femalefashionadvice,chk7uns,1,t5_2s8o5

1086527,0,t3_26hzdi,My number one piece of advice is get some walkable shoes. Depending on how big your school is or how often you tend to go into town youre going to do a lot of walking. I really enjoyed Sperrys for walking around my big college campus and they kept my feet happy while still being neutralmatching outfits but I could wear decent qualitywornin ballet flats or cute boots and still be comfortable. Just dont mess around with flipflops or things with no arch support.Also resist the urge to discard all your clothes and be super minimalist and start from scratch chances are you might get lazy on laundry. Having some less stylish things as backup is better than having to do a mad rush to get clean clothes or wear something dirty. You might also want some college branded merchandise if you find yourself going to a sports event or anything schoolspirity it doesnt sound like what youre going for but I mention it because Victorias Secret Pink collection has ridiculously well draped college vneck tees.,femalefashionadvice,chrsh06,1,t5_2s8o5

Also a lot of people complain all the time aw man i wanted this outfit but they dont sell that style anymore so maybe youll have others envy that you got it.

1111506,1,t1_chulwqb,gtI have never seen anyone say lose weight to a specific user.So because the comments arent geared at a specific fat woman but just fat women who want to wear certain clothing it is okay?If people feel you are body shaming them when giving advice maybe its because your own perception of their body getting in the way of looking an outfit in the terms they are asking advice under. As other people have already mentioned in this thread some people seem to be operating on the premise of giving advice based on creating ideal body types. This is problematic when ideal body types are completely subjective.Its also a pretty bold notion to say if any fat woman were to post in a crop top and booty shorts asking for advice you automatically know the negative advice you would be giving her. It would be different if you felt that way about all women of all body types but as Ive said before fat women chubby women plus size women etc are not all one synonymous type of woman. The fact that people feel they can degrade a whole body class as this with such statements is appalling and its not oversensitive to speak up on that matter.Edit Grammar stuff.,femalefashionadvice,chumxbp,9,t5_2s8o5

Go for good fabrics and well fitting items.Stay away from sequins and logo shirts if you are after a classic look.Think skirts ballet flats elegant heels and fitted dresses. Soft exquisite fabrics that will last and look flattering on the body. Lace not cheap cashmere cotton etc. Dont go for something because it is in fashion go for styles that are classical and you will always be in fashion. Accessory wise dont go flashy go delicate and elegant. Dont wear large costume jewelry instead invest in long term pieces that can go with many outfits.Make up go a natural look compliment your skin hair and eye colour. Dont go overboard with foundation etc instead try and go for a natural skin basebb or tinted moisturizer. Wear a gloss in soft pinks or peaches or in natural colours.

Its also annoying to fish through a rack to grab the right sizes check the price and check the materials.

Sooo much easier to tell if I can actually make outfits with it rather than trying to remember what I own and guessing if the colors will look right or whatever. And reviews! Say what you will about Modcloth but their reviews are the best because people list their measurements along with the size they got and how it fit and sometimes post a picture of themselves wearing the item.

1242905,0,t1_ci9ep2v,I really didnt mean that dressing formally is the only definition of dressing well thats why I added that . clothes that fit and . cohesive style are also factors. By saying dressing one level above what is appropriate I also did not mean that any level of formal dress above that which would be appropriate means you are welldressed. Thats why I gave the example of smart casual at the grocery store and not black tie at the grocery store. Often when people ask for interview outfit advice we tell them to wear an outfit that is one level of formality above what they would be expected to wear at the job. If people wear jeans in the office wear slacks and a blouse etc... That is dressing well.

If your hair isnt super straight youll need to at least dry them every day or be ready to pin them back. I know if I dont do that they curl weird and look awful.

1262826,0,t3_28k47z,Im currently living under monsoon season  degrees and random downpours scattered throughout the day so I know this weather way too well.My biggest advice is to get a lot of sandals with secured ankle straps. Flats during the rain are terrible the water stays in your shoes and your feet get dirty and smelly. Rainboots are way too hot. Sandals allow for your foot to breath and to dry easily. Making sure they have a good strap will help secure them so youre not sliding around in them. I usually opt for skirts as opposed denim. Cotton skirts or dresses dry a lot quicker than denim does. Just beware of random gusts of wind.I personally find windbreakers and the like to be kind of useless. Theyre so muggy.

A lovely floral silk blouse for going out and during the dayalso going out some nice chiffon blousestopssleeveless blouses and then the hairmake upaccessories to alternate. I especially love sleeveless collared tie up blouses in polka dot too put these two together and its like a modern retro. Or for a more casual look just a nice tshirt and pumps. Really this is so flexible you can dress it up or down according to what youre doing. Also doesnt take up much room in your bag to shove a top in there for later but keep the skirt. For cooler weather a good pair of high waisted well fitted skinny jeans or a funky pair of leggings and a baggy top with heel wedge boots. Not forgetting of course a bunch of nice dresses! That if they are the right length you can pop a skater skirt on top of that too to mix it up a bit if you like. thats generally my whole wardrobe in a nutshell!

1371229,0,t3_29rcte,I am more willing to dump money into shoes coats and jeans rather than purses. I mean there are some purses in the world I would love to have but I get much more excited about saving up for the perfect pair of loafers or big wool coat. Im not totally sure why but it may be because most of my life I refused to even carry a purse and prefer clutches or wallets instead. As far as expensive pieces goes I have a Schott Perfecto retails for around ? a Zoltag and Voltaire Deluxe Blazer retailed for  and a pair of Dieppa Restrepo Cali oxfords which retail for like  but Im going to talk about them anyway because I love them. The Schott Jacket I actually bought this jacket barely used for far less than retail but it was one of my first higher quality pieces. Its held up tremendously well through multiple surprise rain storms and general wear. If it was stolen I would probably set my sights on an Acne or Rick Owens leather jacket but its still been a really great purchase. The Blazer I bought this blazer as an impulse buy at Nordstrom rack for . It fit perfect just off the rack had a minimal leather detail and is really well made. Im pretty sure its something that just didnt sell at Nordies and got moved to the rack as the Deluxe line is only  ready to wear pieces in total so the blazer is like  ever made which is sort of cool. I dont think its at all timeless as it doesnt have lapels and has a harsh geometric angle but I find it to look nice and it fills my black blazer for interviews slot. If it was stolen I would replace it with something similar but wouldnt bother hunting down the same one. I also probably wouldnt have paid retail for it but I felt like I was getting a deal and would have ended up spending upwards of  on a blazer anyways. Heres a fit pic. Please ignore the billowy linen shirt I really need a cotton tailored buttondown to fulfill my sartorial dreams but whatevs.The Shoes Okay Im gonna admit it I picked these up in a Buffalo Exchange barely worn for . They were originally brown but I had them dyed black but left the contrast sole. I would replace these with the exact same shoes for retail in a heartbeat. Theyre as comfy as all leather shoes should be and theyve held up great. Im going to put a vibram half sole on them as soon as it starts getting rainy again but Im all around impressed. Im planning on buying some other DR shoes as well. So all around Ive been happy with my more expensive purchases. Other things I like to spend more money on are things like cashmere silk denim and other leather goods. Right now Im planning on saving up for a new pair of ankle boots and a cashmere cardigan. ,femalefashionadvice,cio6750,2,t5_2s8o5

1378872,0,t3_29vqj2,Northern Wisconsin resident here.  Where I live is not uncommon for the temp to drop under . Coldest I went to work in was . I know a lot of people are saying to not wear jeans or to wear fleece leggings underneath but I like jeans and most of mine are too skinny for am extra layer so I really just do it anyway. My way to stay warm is by wearing a big ankle length coat. It does a perfect job keeping my legs warm until Im inside and dont need the warmth anymore.  Sweater dresses and fleece lined leggings are also heaven btw. As far as feet go... dont wear flats or mesh sneakers at all.  Youll freeze.  In winter I live in leather boots and oxfords with real winter boots tossed in for the times in going further than from car to destination.  Also I wear wool socks  of the time.   ,femalefashionadvice,cip4ksx,5,t5_2s8o5

1439429,0,t3_2amfcw,Ive just finished purchasing my fallwinter capsule wardrobe my nd time doing so so here are some pointers gathered from my experience Establish whether or not you are essentially starting from scratch in building this wardrobe. If so and it looks like you are then accept that you will have to downsizereadjust to fit your budget. It is very very very difficult to maximize quality and minimize cost when purchasing an entire wardrobe.  That said establish a budget and stick to it. Having a budget will allow you to organize your purchases and have a concrete plan. Once you have an idea of all the basic pieces you want to buy as you do in the collage youve provided go online and find them. Take your time here! You are basically shopping for all your items now but without actually buying them. Create a spreadsheet and list out all these items in an organized fashion. Mine had  columns category ie. pants outerwear tops the specific item name ie. Penfield Vassan Parka its cost and URL to enable easy access. The great thing about Excel is that once you lay out all your planned purchases you can use an Autosum formula and have it calculate the total cost of all of these items. It will almost definitely be over budget. Thats OK!! Thats how it works. This is the tough part. This is when having organized your stuff into categories is really helpful. Basically you need to imagine a sort of pie chart for your budget  figure out what percentage of your budget should go to each category. Its not going to be equal youre naturally going to want to and should really spend more in one category than in another. For example the biggest chunk of my pie chart in my most recent capsule was dedicated to outerwear  not because I purchased the most items in this category but because I wanted to spend the most money on quality. Figure out which category this is for you  it could be shoes it could be blazersouterwear....whatever.  Once you figure out your piechart you can get to paring down your purchase list. Not going to lie this part sucks. Youre going to end up having to let some pieces go  BUT! its important to remember that a capsule wardrobe is a work in progress. I bought my first capsule wardrobe for fallwinter last year and I was really happy with it but it still was missing stuff I wanted. This year I expanded it and I still dont have everything I want. Thats kind of just how it goes when you stick to a budget. Remember that a capsule wardrobe is meant to be intermixable you should be able to create many outfits from the items you have. With this in mind pare down all the novelty items  these are the items that while theyre wonderful they wont be very versatile. For me these were dresses  while I loved them I knew that compared to everything else in my closet they would get fewer wears because they couldnt be mixed into many distinct outfits. It may be different for you  figure this out and cut out as many novelty items as you can to get inside your budget. Figure out your wardrobe essentials. These are the crux of your capsule  the items you will wear a lot and that will be the foundation of your general style. These are the nonnegotiable items. For me these were a pair of darkwash jeans a pair of desert boots a parka a wool sweater and a chambray buttondown.  Now youre left with the nonnegotiables and everything else. In the everything else category go back through all the items and do some more paring. You will eventually be left on your spreadsheet with a list of everything that you plan to buy and a final cost for it all. Make sure to factor in tax and shipping into your costs. Now you can get to buying.As for your question on what not to cheap out on  this really depends on you and where youre living. Im living in the Northeast so I dont cheap out on winter essentials  snowrain boots heavy winter coat etc.. Generally though Id advise to go highquality on shoes and outerwear. The sucky corollary of going highquality is that you usually have to go lowquantity bc of cost. Thus all the paring. Basically the most important thing to remember when working on a capsule wardrobe here is to adapt your planned purchases to your budget rather than adapt your budget to all your purchases. Set your hard maximum and pare pare pare. Yeah you wont get everything BUT youll get a damn good versatile wardrobe that makes you happy. ,femalefashionadvice,ciwpj51,26,t5_2s8o5

The jeanlike pants are probably twill and I wouldnt call that appropriate though theyd probably be fine if youre hired. Business formal in my neck of the woods is a skirt suit with hose but NYC is less conservative at least about the hose. I do think its funny that you have bought a black suit.  Everyone in New York wears black suits.  Its a cultural thing. You can always spot the out of towners especially the southern pro had vice attorneys because they wear light suits. Do you have a necklace or scarf to add?  You know so you dont blend in with the crowd? Also pro tip dont wear your jacket in the car.  Carry it and hang it up and dont out it on until youre walking in the building.

1536733,0,t3_2bu0e0, blouses and  pants? and you replace them after  months? theres a better way to go about this.clothes are going to start looking worn once you actually wear them. theres no getting around that. what you can do to help prevent them from going to waste is find a good rotation. dont wear the same thing every day and that should help your uniform concern as well. also i dont think youll need  pants. you should probably have  or  pairs. look into skirts look into dresses. there is so much more out there than shirts and pants. thrift shopping will be your best friend as well as the other post suggests. you can find a lot of quality clothing on the cheap. you do not have to break the bank at macys or anywhere else. and keep in mind that a lot of store run promotions and sales.good places to check out for clothing other than thrift shopsmacysloftbanana republicj crewwhite house black marketnordstrom and nordstrom rackand etc. these are the stores i can think of off the top of my head that run deals and sales all the time. last point you can accessorize. get some bracelets earrings scarves rings necklaces. also you can throw different outwear over your outfit such as blazers and cardigans. as far as shoes go i would get a nice pair of sturdy heels. theres also smoking slippers loafers oxfords etc. another piece of advice too start a pintrest board and see what you like. see where the clothes are coming from and shop for either that item or similar. also look at what coworkers are wearing. ,femalefashionadvice,cj8wl7i,8,t5_2s8o5

1546172,0,t1_cj9l0v9,Stone cold truth right there. I totally agree. A capsule wardrobe is about making things easy for yourself by consciously limiting your choices. You cant have one until youve put in the work of choosing the limits. Your pinterest thread has so many disparate shapes and elements at this stage its impossible to advise you on which styles to pick because only you know which ones best represent your taste.The good news is that you have a very defined color palette picked out for yourself oxblood military green subdued red plaids denim blue grayscale and maybe a little bit of beige. These colors are cohesive with each other and versatile so nice work there. I would advise you to cultivate your pinterest board some more with an eye on shape and proportion. Try making a second board that you pin your absolute favorites from this board onto and make a note of what specifically you like about each outfit as you do so and try to mentally calculate how the pieces might fit together with other outfits you like. E.g. I might repin the top right image and comment  sleeves ballet neck untucked over skinny jeans fitted but relaxed clean lines and think that the tshirt would also work tucked into a skirt or layered under a plaid buttonup if I were into those looks. After a while of doing this your  favorite styles will emerge. I enthusiastically second intomind for detailed specific instructions on how to make a capsule wardrobe once youve reached that stage. Good luck!,femalefashionadvice,cja348w,2,t5_2s8o5
1548478,0,t1_cja4yzx,You know Good Morning America a morning talk show here in the US for nonUS redditors did a special on cashmere this past winter. They said that there was a difference between  cashmere and  cashmere but you couldnt really tell the difference between high end  and midrange  cashmere and one of the brands they really recommended for value cashmere was J. Crew. I mean of course there was a long term difference but initial feel and quality high end and mid range were pretty even.

I can still rock skinny jeans and a white tee shirt with a cardigan if I want just looking bigger. . I use pinterest to collate looks I like although thats only a recent thing. I use the images I save to find things I like in my size in those styles.. People I know! I walk around town and suss out what other people are wearing and try to remember things if I like them! I work with a petite thin woman who has excellent dress sense that can be turned easily into my size if I shop around a bit.Honestly I just do what standard sized people do and size it up. I shop at lot at ASOS put in my first order for Modcloth and google around places like CityChic and Etsy to find things I like. Just because an inspo pic is of a thin girl doesnt mean it wont work for you.I am rambling. Basically figure out what you like and then work from there. If you can never find pants that sit just right tailor them. Learn to sew simple shirts so you can have funky patterns if you cant find them. Flip through magazines and copy the most recent trends with stuff you find at department stores or wherever! Thrift! Good luck! lt,femalefashionadvice,cjk91ei,8,t5_2s8o5

Its been  years and I dont miss them except that I cant wear the heirloom earrings my mom gave me. No one has ever commented on the fact that I wear clipons.I only wear earrings on special occasions though I have been wearing them more since I started wearing my hair in an updo more frequently.I feel more polished with earrings when my hair is up. Also the long dangly ones have the effect of reminding me to hold my head and neck more elegantly. They also make my earlobes just sore enough to be a little bit tender to the touch like certain other things can increase sensation in other areas...but thats a topic for another subreddit.,femalefashionadvice,cjqew2w,7,t5_2s8o5

I was wearing a cotton tank with it and he said that since the material is more expensivesilky I cant wear it with a cottonrough top because it contrasts. I need to match the silk material to another smooth material for an outfit to work. Then he gave me some suggestions for colors to wear it with. It blew my mind.

I have been looking for a trench for quite a while but I am kind of realizing it is not for my body type.That trench was IMO very well built and materials very good pockets useful good length all very nice except I really did not like it on me.  It was a matter of not really fitting me shoulders were both big I am narrow shouldered and the flaps not very flattering and the precise shade was a bit orangey for my skin tone.  It was a bit cheaper here but not much and IMO it was good quality for the price tag. If it looked good on me it would have been the cheapest really good trench I have seen around.I have seen Max Mara trenches as being very good and very well cut but they are twice the price of these and about half the price of Burberry so well there is that. Aquascutum I did not try but looked excellent but I think it will not be cheaperI am looking for a classic trench which is not too short and fabric must not be not too thin but that kind of nonwaxed but water repelling  Zara had one which looked fine and it was a nice fabric but it was  euros more there I guess and besides me being between sizes the quality was annoying scratched buttons shallow pockets. The cheaper trenches were all very flimsy and with trendish details which is not what I want.Boden is good at this kind of good practical coats with a good classical cut but not sure it will be much cheaper and just checked all their trench patterns this year are IMO garish.

1917503,0,t1_ckk0z9g,Im in the middle of removing several of my tattoos. Im in my early twenties and just got too many too young and I need to eventually have a more professional appearance and it is super hot where I live and I dont want to be confined to long sleeves year round.Your success rate will vary depending on the color of the ink because some are much easier to removefade than others. Black is usually the easiest and blues and greens are really hard to deal with. It does hurt and its not a fun process but the clinic I go to for my removal gives me a numbing cream I slather on  minutes before I go under the laser that helps a lot. They also give you an aloe vera and cortisone cream to apply immediately after and in the days after as you heal and you ice on and off the first day of each session. It will take multiple sessions but theres no way to know how many until you talk to the person doing the removal. My clinic is really determined to give their clients the most naturallooking skin possible so they only allow you to go every eight weeks to prevent scarring. The clinic Im at estimated it will take  years to remove mine so its not a short process. Each of my actual removal sessions take about  minutes under the laser FWIW Im getting a half sleeve a forearm piece and something on a knuckle done in that entire time so the technician is covering a fairly large area in a fairly short amount of time.Research the places you can get it done and go in for a consult to talk about all of your concerns. Laser removal is really YMMV because there are so many factors involved in it.Hope this is helpful! PM me if you have any other questions.EDIT Some words.EDIT EDIT Mine are very noticeably fading. The knuckle piece thats all black will likely be gone in a few more sessions. The colored pieces have a lot of blue and green and will take a lot longer because of that but they have definitely faded and they get a little lighter after each treatment.,femalefashionadvice,ckk8vag,5,t5_2s8o5

1940238,0,t3_2gv0rg,Congrats on the new bag!!  So exciting although I dont envy your decision.  Picking your first bag is like deciding when to lose your virginity  you never want to regret it.  I like the adivce that ubluelimes gives but I want to add in a few things.  First I whole heartedly agree that some bags just have to move with you.  If you need it cross body over your shoulder or dangling off your arm it should do all three at any given moment.  A piece like this just has to do work and look great working.Additionally lets think about forever.  This means it has to transcend time age and trend.  Its got to look fantastic on you today tomorrow in five years and even in ten and possibly when you hand it down to your little girl.  So while you say today that you like rustique or rustic bags when youre searching for a professional job that rustic feel isnt going to be office appropriate.  Also are you going to want to have something rustic in five or ten years?  And to last forever that bitch better hold together because you know youre going to put it through hell.  Finally remember your bag has to transcend trend so pick a color thats not seasonal or trendy but beige or brown thats going to work all year long.All this being said I would suggest you looking at leather satches.  Ralph Lauren Newbury or Kate Spade Cedar Street or maybe even Tory Burch Amanda if you want something a little more flexible.,femalefashionadvice,ckmzt1f,1,t5_2s8o5

However I did find a dress in Banana Republic in  Petite that fit quite well and actually made me look like an adult! and some tops in the Anthropologie petite section too so maybe try looking for shops that have petite sections andor stock  or maybe even ? Due to vanity sizing size  may be too big for you in some places.Also I just wanted to add to check out the Guide to Properly Fitting Bras in the sidebar and rABraThatFits since wearing a properly fitting bra really helps with the fit of your tops ,femalefashionadvice,cl0nf13,1,t5_2s8o5

2072241,0,t1_cl37qxf,Spanx are like ? You can get them at off the rack stores for about half off. They do keep you pretty warm. I buy mine from department stores  Neimans Nordstrom Bloomingdales Macys Dillards etc will all carry Spanx.The style youll want depends on what kind of dress youre wearing. Id take the dress in with you and ask a sales associate  that would honestly be the easiest thing to do.Things to consider  if you dont want to worry about the Spanx slipping down you can get one with cami straps provided your dress has coverage for it. Cheaper control tops tend to roll or dont smooth you out as well. Some people dont have these problems and some do  you wont know until you take it home and try it out. If you dont want to spend a lot on actual Spanx you can try Target or somewhere else that sells alternative control top hosiery. Spanx are going to be tight  theyre holding you in. Some people like my mother hate this. YMMV. Regardless of what product you buy make sure theyll let you return used hosiery just in case you hate them and dont want to keep them. You cant try on hosiery in store but you can take it home try it on and then return them if they dont work for you. ,femalefashionadvice,cl3872y,1,t5_2s8o5

2092285,0,t3_2iqqbf,This is going to sound completely unhelpful but it is the only way I really learnedTake an entire weekend.  Go to stores many stores.  Ideally hit Kohls Marshalls TJ Maxx Macys Nordstroms Forever HampM Express TheLimited I listed them in order of how helpful they are based on valuebased content and variety.Look for. Clothing that has fabric that feels good in your hands.  I have held really crappy feeling cotton and really luxefeeling polyester.  Generally natural fabrics are better but all that matters is it isnt crappy.. Colors that you like and you look good in.When clothing meets both of those criteria pick it up and try it on there is only one exception to this rule  if it has a dropwaist put it back.  You may be surprised what looks good on you.  You may hate  of what you try on. But you will find clothing that fits you and makes you look good and you will be able to look for clothing based on what you learn during that trip.Short of one of those discovery fashion experiences I would suggest looking for dresses that have a defined waist and play with belting them.  If you are trying to minimize your shoulders do not wear capsleeves or anything resembling cap sleeves  it should either be actually sleeveless or have a proper sleeve.  The draping of fabric just over your shoulders will make them appear larger.Honestly you do not appear to me to be a pear shape.  Your hips appear relatively proportional to your bust.  As far as having thick thighs  I feel you.  I have found bootcut styles to be the most flattering.  They apply slight flare at the end to balance out your shape.  Overall my best defense on my bloat days however is ALine dresses and dresses with ruchingextra fabric to be the most forgiving skater dresses are still very popular!.,femalefashionadvice,cl5rxis,1,t5_2s8o5

Edit the material of the top looks clingythin... you can see your bracup outlines. Can you wear something under it?

2136353,0,t3_2jfvpc, It depends on what Im doing on a given day. If Im going to work no theyre not my allday shoes. I swap them out once I get to work. When I was in undergrad I would sometimes wear them as my all day shoes.... but they can just be a little cumbersome so it has to be flooding before Ill do all day in them.  Sure but you need some really warm socks or boot liners. Also make sure that they have enough tread because I can see that being bad. I have sweaty feet and yes you can have issues with the nonbreatheability of them but it doesnt prevent people from wearing them. Just wear good socks.  I have a pair of rain clogs aka not tall boots that I wear when I need to look more professional at work but other than work I wouldnt ever consider rain boots inappropriate. I mean maybe you shouldnt wear them to class if youre about to give a presentation or when youre going out to dinner at a fancy restaurant.

2315859,0,t3_2ls3bm,Hello! I am also  and am also trying to replace my cheap hampmforever  wardrobe.  I also live in the middle of nowhere with pretty much no nice stores near me. Im using the same approach as you with approximately the same budget  nice thingsmonth  skip a month and save for things outside that budget.  I have a totally different body shape though so I cant help you too too much with sizingfits.Ive made an approximate list of things that I want to own. Some of it is super specific for example dressy minimalist black flat ankle boot with at least one unique defining detail.  Then Ill browse online sites like gilt barneys warehouse the outnet neiman marcus last call etc... until I see something that fits my description.  It is rather time extensive but I dont mind browsing frequently and I dont buy unless it fills a hole that Ive already established in my wardrobe.  I have also bought several things from everlane and I think the quality is reasonable for the price.  Ive also made a list of quality specifications that I stick to.  Intomind has really helped with this.   For example all shoes I buy must be leather and be lined with leather.  If appropriate they must have a leather sole also.  Clothing must be all natural fibers with some very specific exceptions for example a minimal amount of spandex added for stretch.  Once I have received the clothing seams must be frenched no sergedfraying seams etc...  Otherwise it gets returned.  Really check out intominds workbook.  I found it incredibly helpful.As far as sizing I measure myself and I measure clothing that I already own and compare that to the provided measurements.  If they have sizing information regarding what the model is wearing thats helpful to me too frequently I just buy a size down from whatever size the model is wearing since Im fairly petitethin.  I also google insert whatever review to see whether things run largesmalllongwhatever.  I know this may not be as helpful to you since we have very different body types but I did find measuring my own clothing to be helpful to compare.  Anyway good luck with your search.  ,femalefashionadvice,clxyejk,2,t5_2s8o5

2343891,0,t3_2m5xh6,Totally depends on what youre looking for. I find the issue most people have in transitioning from early s to late s is to have different collections of outfits for different occasions and this means shopping in different stores for different things. For example jeans and a T no longer work for  of your life. Now theres your workwear collection your eveningsweekends out collection perhaps your outdoor gear or workout collection your loungewear collection and then your super casual collection. Workwear? Try Loft White House Black Market J. Crew Lands End Banana Republic Talbots or New York amp Company.Weekend casual? Try Uniqlo Madewell Target Old Navy Gap.Weekend dressy? Try Kate Spade Saturday Lands End Zara Anthropologie Targets designer collaborations Zara HampM Madewell BCBG JC Pennys JCP line.Also accessories can change everything. The quality of your shoes and purses etc. can really make or break an outfit and at this time of year outerwear is key too. ,femalefashionadvice,cm1f0g5,31,t5_2s8o5

2344696,0,t3_2m70i3,When I think of being comfortable in clothes I think of physical comfort. Being comfortable means not being painfully or irritatingly constrained or exposed by your clothes being at the right temperature. It also means mentally and emotionally comfortable so not feeling strange or out of place in what youre wearing. For example you may feel physically comfortable wearing your pajamas to a law firm but Im assuming that most people would feel emotionally uncomfortable. I think that confidence in terms of style is knowing yourself your likes dislikes and needs. I think it also means that you are accepting of these things and styling yourself accordingly. Ive discussed before on FFA about how I love personal uniforms and I think this may tie into it. Someone who has a very cohesive wardrobe and uniform is in my opinion someone who knows and is comfortable with themselves which comes off as being confident. At the same time Im not saying that someone who tries out different styles and trends isnt confident. Also some people have a uniform because theyre stuck in a rut and are scared of changing their style so theres that. Anyway good discussion question Im looking forward to the rest of the responses. ,femalefashionadvice,cm1il8c,3,t5_2s8o5
2348080,0,t3_2m8eco,All of your stuff doesnt have to matchjust get neutrals for the stuff thats out all the time like a purse or daily headband and get colorspatterns for other things if thats what you like.  You mentioned you have a nylon bag you can get another one that looks professional.  Lesportsac makes the best nylon bags!  I used to carry a few around when I was in college and my main cosmetic bag is Lesportsac.  Here are their neutral handbags though Id lean towards a bag like this for going to work.  Maybe you could find a cheap version of that bag on eBay?  If the prices are too high ebags sells nylon purses that are very similar to Lesportsac for a lower price.  I bought an ebag branded crossbody similar to this one for international travel and it stood up to a lot of beating.As for cosmetic bags get what you like!  No one will really ever see it except you.  If you feel weird about having a Keeping Up Appearances bag inside a professional bag grab a basic bag from Sephora.  With hair accessories get something thats plain to wear to work.  Horn or tortoise shell headbands look classy for work.,femalefashionadvice,cm1xmxh,6,t5_2s8o5

2355847,0,t1_cm2vvw4,No worries it was all new to me too   See if you can find agencies in the area where youre relocating.  Their website should have either a list of recruiters or a general contact email.  Send them your resume with a brief like a short paragraph or less of what interests you and give them your phone number.  They will likely call to followup and talk to you about about your experience and background and to get a feel for your personality.  They work with offices looking for someone on a shortterm basis or sometimes a temp to hire where they can try you out and see if its a good fit.  The temp agency makes money from placing you at a company.  The company will pay the agency hour for example and then the agency will pay you hour. You probably wont have benefits or insurance but you should have a decent hourly rate that will help you get by for awhile while youre looking for a more permanent job.  A lot of temp jobs are admincentered so just be prepared for a lot of that type of work for awhile.I temped for a govt. agency when I first moved to DC and it was pretty decent.  It can be a good way to get some different experiences and make new contacts plus it buys you time to look for a good job while still making some money.  Good luck!!!,femalefashionadvice,cm2w6nq,1,t5_2s8o5

2367985,0,t3_2mhejh,I did some work at a design program at a state college that never touched on shoes I tell you this because its a specialty niche that American schools dont usually cover. Heres how I would approach it Teach yourself to work with leather. There are lots of library books and materials are easy to come across at craftstores and online. Keep a continuous sketch log of design ideas as they come to you so youll know what youre aiming to learn. Talk to a cobbler. Ask them what they do and how they learned to do it. See if you can work with them perhaps as a weekend intern. Contact a design program and ask them for leads for education on shoe design. AFAIK most of them are apprenticeships in Europe. If thats out of reach for you take classes in woodworking for building soles and CAD for designing intricate piecework until you have enough base knowledge to work materials. Then build prototypes until you have a grasp of functionality. ,femalefashionadvice,cm4e40x,9,t5_2s8o5

Also how about a leather jacket if you have one? I know most people only like wearing leather jackets with jeans but I like mixing styles it depends on the items you mix though.Regarding jewelry you absolutely cannot wear a delicate pendant necklace like the one you have in this picture.

Now I focus a lot more on quality and have mostly simple pieces... solid colors with simple cuts whereas for a long time it seemed everything I owned was a statement piece. Just do what you like.

Has anyone done the overnight trip rather than gifts before? Im thinking I would get her something to use of the trip like a new scarf or overnight bag and then put a picture of the event in it. Thoughts? Background my girlfriend and I have been together two years. We are both young lawyers so we dont get a lot of free time and the trip would have to be a one night stay over the weekend for now. ,femalefashionadvice,cmp054j,2,t5_2s8o5

2544912,0,t3_2out8q,i would recommend getting a brasized swimsuit from a DD brand. they cost about the same as ones from typical retailers.im about your size im commonly missized as B but i actually wear a DD and brasized swimwear seriously changed my life. theyre way more comfortable but they also dont look like bras. nobody will notice the underwire unless you point it out. another plus side is that you wont feel super uncomfortable walking around before or after the beach. theyre just as revealing as typical swimwear but they do make onepieces but they fit better so you dont feel like youre revealing as muchyou feel more confident. here is one i have from freya. cleo and curvy kate also make swimwear.i would definitely recommend going on rabrathatfits if youve never been. i dont have as much of an acute need for a better bras as someone in the  FK range but its made a huge difference for me. if you live in a climate where you can go swimming or go to the beach for most of the year then it might make more sense to put more moneytime into finding the right swimsuit.,femalefashionadvice,cmqr8z9,5,t5_2s8o5

2556606,0,t3_2ozrqj,At the risk of humblebragging Im a size  and wear a lot of things that are large and people dont believe me most of the time. I read once that Christina Hendricks is a size  and it was like uhhh I am nowhere near as curvy as her and I admit most of the time I buy size  stuff because uhh I got a big butt and Im kind of pear shaped. I have some size  blazers I guess. But I guess Ive never really looked at people on pinterest or here and thought ugh I wanna see some normal sized people who look like me! I like to think I can wear most of the stuff I see on other people and I can generally look at it with a general sense of hmm this might make my butt look big. Maybe its different if everything is perfectly proportional but its not that hard to go try a bunch of shit on and figure out which shapes actually work for you personally. I think part of it might be Im not as big of an online shopper as the rest of this sub. But if Im going to find a blogger with the same body type Id need one with the same skin tone and hair color and all of that as well because honestly that makes a much bigger difference.,femalefashionadvice,cmsaaxn,6,t5_2s8o5

2655696,0,t3_2qb5c4,Hi. I have trich and am thinking of doing the same thing!A good friend of mine has alopecia and her hair was very thin and patchy. She shaved her head and bought a few wigs. They look great and she loves them. She was actually the one that put the idea in my head as a real possibility. I had always toyed around with the notion ever since high school as I had a teacher who wore them more on that below but I never really actually considered it until this girl took the plunge and I saw both how great they looked and also how much they improved her selfesteem.I had a high school teacher who wore wigs just because she wanted to. Nothing was wrong with her hair it was just clipped short. She had a variety of different wigs so it was very obvious they were wigs and she was very open and unashamed about them which I think is how you should be. She very happily admitted that she wore them and why. If someone asks you why youre wearing a wig you dont have to tell them anything is wrong with your hair. You just want to! You dont like styling hair or your hair is short and sometimes you want it long etc. You dont have to tell anyone anything you dont want to tell them.The only downsides would be they can be heavy the long ones can get pulled off your head if you put your pursestrap down on them and so on and they can be hot and itchy. Also the better ones can be extremely expensive though my friend with alopecia had good luck buying some cheaper wigs in hair extension shops that cater primarily towards black women. They have a lot of really nice wigs that are often pretty cheap. But! That said some cheap wigs just look like plastic doll hair so dont buy them off the internet you absolutely must see them in person and obviously try to buy the most expensive thing you can afford.,femalefashionadvice,cn5897p,1,t5_2s8o5

I wear the flannels all the time they are really thick and warm and sooo soft.  And they seem really sturdy. The sweater Ive only worn once. Its not the softest Merino Ive ever worn it was a bit itchy so they are probably using a shorter staple fiber cheaper for their yarn. But other than that its very pretty and had a flattering fit.

In fact a little boy asked if I was a princess once and it made me feel so good haha.Depending on the day I used to just tuck in a normal tshirt or lace top into the skirt and belted it I wore the skirt a little bit high waisted as the skirt was too long. If it was a bit cooler I would throw on a chambray shirt and a big necklace. If it was hotter I would just throw on a cute crop top.

2715447,0,t3_2r28ou,Its more about your frame size than your weight. For example no matter how slender you might get broad male shoulders and ribcages will be harder to fit into clothes cut for women. A woman who outweighed you by quite a bit might have smaller shoulders and a smaller ribcage than you do. However thats assuming you have an average build. If you are very smallboned or built narrow it will be easier for you. Also it doesnt sound like you need to lose weight. Its not going to alter your proportions anyway. A woman of your heightweight would probably have a smaller waist larger hips more breast tissue and smallershallower shoulders. ,femalefashionadvice,cncqhpt,1,t5_2s8o5

As for other people I never really think about what their style says about their orientation unless its very inyourface.

Heres my reasoning both shoes have a very different proportion color and feel. They would both go with a lot of outfits but they both woud only really enhance certain outfits. Both are quite classic and could last you a long time especially if youd wear them on alternating days. Havig both would give you a lot more versatility.

I really like spray sunscreens because they have good coverage and are fast to out on but theyre bad for the environment smell I put it on outside since it gets everywhere and makes non carpet slippery and you go through them very quickly. Youll want an SPF of at least  but anything over  doesnt make much of a difference. If you go swimming for any length of time reapply when you get out or every  hours. Also remember your ears feet and scalp. Theres nothing worse than having hood coverage but accidentally burning your scalp or feet.

2908557,0,t1_cnypagq,Most coupons or sale alerts come because you signed up to get emails from a retailer.  You can easily do that on their websites.  I get something like  emails from different retailers a day but they all get filtered to my Gmail promotions folder so it isnt difficult to manage.  Most of the time its just promotions not coupons but when Ann Taylor emails me to say that all their sale is now an additional  off Ill head into the store to try some things on.  Im a sale rack browser myself and if I have an occasion to be at a mall Ill spend  minutes flipping through the sale racks for each of the four or five stores I tend to like.  Youre likely to get better deals if you go shopping often and just wait for low prices but not everyone enjoys window shopping.  gt  for a regular shirt is so god damn expensive.This is probably a tad unrealistic unless you want to solely shop at Forever or Target.   for a tshirt might be a lot but if youre looking for things nicer than a tshirt youll probably have to get used to the idea that nicer clothing costs more.  Forever prices are rockbottom relative to other stores.  ,femalefashionadvice,cnypkq0,7,t5_2s8o5

2988246,0,t3_2udhwt,About two years ago I moved from a job in the restaurant industry to a professional job working with undergrads.

I kept wearing the same clothes I wore to the restaurant which leaned pretty young  a lot of colored legging pants stripes combat boots ballet flats. Got tired of being mistaken for an undergrad by other staff and the undergrads themselves. I teach a course too and it always seemed to take a few classes to establish myself with them. Got a nice promotion within the office a year ago and have been slowly trying to recreate my wardrobe to lean more professional even though it makes me look way out of place at the office. Higherups are definitely taking me more seriously now the undergrads understand that Im an authority figure and I feel waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more comfortable in my greyscale clothing even outside of work. Its wonderful. Ive extended this to working on my total appearance including skincare and makeup. Im loving it.

3070440,0,t1_cog8t1g,Here a shortish summaryFullgrain leather refers to hides that have not been sanded buffed or snuffed as opposed to topgrain or corrected leather to remove imperfections or natural marks on the surface of the hide. The grain remains allowing the fiber strength and durability. The grain also has breathability resulting in less moisture from prolonged contact. Rather than wearing out it will develop a patina during its expected useful lifetime. High quality leather furniture and footwear are often made from fullgrain leather. Fullgrain leathers are typically available in two finish typesaniline semianiline.Topgrain leather the most common type used in highend leather products is the secondhighest quality. It has had the split layer separated away making it thinner and more pliable than fullgrain. Its surface has been sanded and a finish coat added to the surface which results in a colder plastic feel with less breathability and it will not develop a natural patina. It is typically less expensive and has greater resistance to stains than fullgrain leather so long as the finish remains unbroken.Correctedgrain leather is any leather that has had an artificial grain applied to its surface. The hides used to create corrected leather do not meet the standards for use in creating vegetaltanned or aniline leather. The imperfections are corrected or sanded off and an artificial grain embossed into the surface and dressed with stain or dyes. Most correctedgrain leather is used to make pigmented leather as the solid pigment helps hide the corrections or imperfections. Corrected grain leathers can mainly be bought as two finish types semianiline and pigmented.Split leather is leather created from the fibrous part of the hide left once the topgrain of the rawhide has been separated from the hide. During the splitting operation the topgrain and drop split are separated. The drop split can be further split thickness allowing into a middle split and a flesh split. In very thick hides the middle split can be separated into multiple layers until the thickness prevents further splitting. Split leather then has an artificial layer applied to the surface of the split and is embossed with a leather grain bycast leather. Splits are also used to create suede. The strongest suedes are usually made from grain splits that have the grain completely removed or from the flesh split that has been shaved to the correct thickness. Suede is fuzzy on both sides. Manufacturers use a variety of techniques to make suede from fullgrain. A reversed suede is a grained leather that has been designed into the leather article with the grain facing away from the visible surface. It is not considered to be a true form of suede.,femalefashionadvice,cog8xo1,0,t5_2s8o5

I have a very high arch and need to wear inserts in all my shoes but working with a podiatrist I was able to get a pair that is thin enough to even wear in flats.In the interim you definitely need to take the inserts with you and shop.  I need to go up . size in all my shoes now to accommodate the inserts.  I would second the docs comment I think a combat boot style thats a bit wider would be more likely to accommodate than a pull on boot.  Something with laces will also be good because wearing inserts will lift your foot inside the boot and put pressure on the top of your footif you have something with laces you can tie them loosertighter until theyre comfortable.,femalefashionadvice,colcm3s,1,t5_2s8o5

I think a low heel will be comfortable and keep the dressedup vibe nicely unlike flats which imo just dont look as dressy no matter how they might otherwise be blingedout without throwing off the hemline. A navyroyal blue colored dress will probably look good with any metallic its similar to black that way so go with what looks best with your skin tone. I have a pair of platinum heels that I originally bought to go with a metallicburgundy dress.  And I find myself reaching for them to wear with my LBD over my black pair of heels so I think youll get a lot of wear out of a metallic shoe over one that would only specifically match that particular dress.

Which means they want to get rid of it because its the only one they have and theyd rather let it go for cost than to hang on to only one of something.So in a way after all of the people that had to handle it along the way get paid for handling it someone probably lost a little money but not noticeably so.,femalefashionadvice,couk5zs,0,t5_2s8o5

Who does that?. So! I am in need of curvyhourglassfriendly styles. I look best in nottootight skinnies almoststraight bootcuts or any straightfromthekneedown styles.

3210863,0,t1_couse8p,You make a good point there. I would actually love to see more traditionally feminine pieces used in menswearbe considered unisex. Though some designers are pushing the envelope in that area like J.W. Andersons long cuffs and Rick Owens tunics Theres also been a bit of animal print in menswear recently heres Saint Laurent and Marc Jacobs even though thats a type of print that is normally seen in womenswear. But its true that menswear for women is much more socially acceptable than the other way around and its going to take time before feminine influences in mens clothing is ubiquitous. ,femalefashionadvice,cout0ip,12,t5_2s8o5

3236975,0,t3_2x4t90,Congrats on your awesome progress!!  Im not of much use with shoebagaccessory advice other than suggesting that you buy what is comfortable and will coordinate well.What has worked for me in the past is to buy a couple of neutral items per season that could change sizes with me. Slouchy sweaters open cardigans skinnies with stretch and tops that dont have a ton of structure in the shoulder can transition gracefully.  I really only buy long term pieces when they fit at the waist Aline skirts not dependent on my hips lol have some stretch or fit my frame well jackets and sweaters right shoulder width and length pants good rise and length.  Almost anything can be taken in when needed.If you like skinny pants consider  Levis denizen stretch jeans and Old Navys Pixie pants.  They are both inexpensive and have long inseams available so they might be good transition pants.  Im not sure if they will work for  as my inseam is  ha.Extra  If you live near Nordstrom or Nordstrom Rack and plan to get much of what you buy tailored consider getting their credit or debit card.  They offer cheap tailoring for items purchased through them you can bring things back any time it isnt just for the date of purchase.  If you have a card then the cost of the tailoring is credited to your card for future purchases.,femalefashionadvice,coxipej,1,t5_2s8o5

I think you might be a good candidate for a capsule wardrode its similar to what you do already. I would search classic capsule wardrobe here in this sub and online. Youll get a good idea what a reasonable budget should be. Once you have a more specific idea in mind of what youre looking for finding pieces will be much less overwhelming. You will absolutely need to try lots of things on. Vanity sizing is a motherfucker be prepared to wear several different sizes even within the same brand. Its not you its the clothes.

3411247,0,t3_2z9f2x,This has happened at least two times I can remember and one extra time when I was leaving home so I had time to change.I am fat especially in the thighs and all pants will wear out there at the thighs right beneath the crotch where they rub against eachother. Simply by not having more fabric. This happens way faster with linen pants although I love them to literally death in summertime.When they are on the verge of aaaalmost ripping there is an action that will almost for certain stretch them that extra part where the last remaining thread where it is worn down breaks getting up on a bike. Im from Copenhagen I bike everywhere. And I even have my seat lower than you should because I dont like the balancing act when you stop if you have it the correct height so I lift my leg less higher than others do.One time I ripped my pants getting up on my bike leaving my apartment went up and changed. Another time I ripped it when getting up on the bike after shopping in the city center to get new pants so great timing so I was on my way home and just had to endure that  hour of biking not like you would notice among all the other people biking unless you where really looking.

This is someone I met on reddit and was looking to work with professionally. She seemed nice enough when we talked but...nope she posts in rfatlogic and rfatpeoplestories and calls overweight people ham planets and land lards and other cruel and derogatory terms. UGH. I do NOT want to associate with someone like that. It really upsets me to know there are people like this in the world. A lot of my friends and family are lovely amazing kind wonderful people yet they would be ridiculed in these subs based on their shallowest traits. In my opinion people who post on those subs are just as bad as racists hating on someone for their appearance and thinking they are superior. I thought about not posting this here because I was thinking she might go through my post history and see but I am still just so angry and upset about it and need to vent. And anyway she should be ashamed of her behavior so idgaf. FUCK YOU for being a horrible shallow vapid judgmental person.  The people you ridicule may not be beautiful on the outside but you are ugly at your core.  I am really disturbed that there are so many people in the world who are obviously unhappy with themselves and feel the need to target others to try to make themselves feel better.

3579453,0,t1_cq0381t,Onepieces are probably best if you aim to actually swim. I prefer ones with higher neck lines to avoid the water pushing the top down when I push forward in the water. If you do want to wear a twopiece make sure the top fits well strong straps high neck sleek fit. If you wear a flimsier style bikini top it is very likely that the water might push it entirely off the force of the water may undo the straps or youll feel uncomfortable in the water that something is about to become undone. And for a bottom piece make sure it again  fits well at the waistband in the front and back.I would avoid wearing a tshirt in the pool. Once a regular tshirt gets wet it almost feels like a weight on my body pulling me down and can irritate my skin as it moves about in the water as it will move a lot slower than you. If you do wish to cover up more wear kind of a surf style top which is intended to be worn in the water. It should fit your body better and be less of a pain when youre trying to move about.In Ireland and anywhere Ive been throughout Europe you have to wear a swimming cap especially if youre female to avoid getting the filters in the pools clogged with hair. I prefer to wear a nonrubbery style hat as they are easier to get on and I find them comfier however a rubbery one will keep your hair more dry Ive always found my hair will still get slightly wet around the edges but still a lot drier than the polyester caps.

3634677,0,t1_cq5um5z,Id also say part of the looking cheap problem and the trying too hard problem both come from the fact that this looks like you had a bunch of items that you liked and then put them all on at once. Do the yellow pant while not my style in bold and interesting pairing them with all the colourblocked items AND the stiletto boots seems to be a bit much. Pick one or two items that are flashy or bold and put them on a more neutral canvas  so for example that with a black or white Tshirt or tank and perhaps a neutral coloured blazer or cardigan with flats or booties will achieve more of the aesthetic youre looking for. Or just the colourblocked top with less bright maybe pastel? Or just more muted bottoms. Thus I dont think the cheapness is a matter of the inherent quality of the items rather the styling. This is a great situation in which the old adage of taking one item off would work. ,femalefashionadvice,cq6kx4g,15,t5_2s8o5

3670871,0,t3_32cucs,While this does revolve around fashion much of the discussion is generalizable to other areas like music etc. I think this was really interesting to read because of how coolness in the West was articulated here as both something subversive and yet paradoxically conservative. If we could consider that this is generalizable in the same way to other modes of expression i.e. film dance etc. then it may be a useful model for understanding the speed and direction of change in various trends. I think one end that was left out though was that at some point there are things that come out which are simply new and fascinating. To draw from film when the Matrix had that  degree shot it became the biggest deal for a few years and was overzealously parodied in movies and on TV. There was just something inherently stimulating about that novel approach. Id include here other inherently interesting phenomena like optical illusions etc. to point toward the very biases we have in our experience of things as humans if that makes any sense.  ,femalefashionadvice,cqapbty,4,t5_2s8o5

This also allows me to utilize my entire wardrobe in different ways like pairing a sundress with sandals and baseball cap.Dont worry about blending in.

Have to say though this bag taught me the lesson that leather is worth the splurge. This baby gets dirrrrty.Here is my everyday purse Sorta wish it was a solid black but the gold adds a nice pop to a rather neutral closet. Its comfy roomy and fulfills my criteria of shoving a makeup bag charger scarf and wallet in comfortably  it also unzips quite a bit so digging for my lipbalmwalletpenkeys is easy peasy. Ambivalent towards this lil guy.  Heres a pic not mine of my first splurge purse. I like it but wish it came with a cross body strap  for  I wont complain though. Use this one for summery days as it adds a certain grownupness I look hella young to summer dresses. Maybe I should look into adding a cross body strap.Last tote! Got this one as a gift.

A couple days later a different petite blog Stylish Petite shares a sponsored post featuring the same dressthis time its  and coming from Sheinside.This is nothing to disparage the bloggers they probablyhopefully have no idea but this shit is shady. A lot of these sites are buying from wholesalers presenting them in different ways to attract different clientele. Just compare the site designGoodnight Macaroon obviously tries to exude boutique I look at it and the first thing I think is Lauren Conrad to get the clients willing to pay higher prices whereas Sheinside is scooping up fast fashion dealhunters everything is always a slashed price new item section for each day of the week extremely limited flash sales to encourage impulse purchases.Quick edit And maybe theres nothing wrong per se with selling wholesale items but when they make cheap shit seem really luxe and then try their best to screw you over and discourage you from returns...

I have wild thick long hair and only get my hair cut x a year because its so expensive and I prefer it long anyway so I end up spending  alone on cutting amp tips Im very generous.

4009433,0,t3_2wfu54,Hey guys I originally made this in a post but the mods said to post it here. I hope someone sees this!Im going to prom and I designed a dream outfit of mine. Its a blouse with a nice black vest and a flowy skirt. Heres a sketch I did with and without the vest on. The necklace has to be a part of the outfit because its a special necklace I dont take off. I am strongly considering adding a bowtie.I experimented with a lot of colours. I liked light blue top  dark purple skirt and green top  dark purple skirt but they didnt seem prommy enough. I favor colder colours over warm ones but if you think a warm colour would look better or if you find something warm online that could be helpful let me know please please please!Also I was thinking of making the sleeves more ruffly kind of like this picture but much shorter up the arm. Also Im imagining said ruffles as well as the ones around the neck of the blouse will be pretty light compared to the rest of the outfit almost like a pastel green or whatever the colour ends up being.The current tentative plan is to maybe have a local designer create the shirt and maybe the skirt too???? depending on how much more it will be and also how hard it would be to figure out by myself. I dont think Ill be having the vest custom. Im still unsure about where Ill find the perfect one though so if you guys have any recommendations on that too that would be immensely appreciated. Heres the vest that I mostly based mine off of. By the way I imagine it so the knot in the skirt will be pretty much the same thing in the back with the pieces of fabric meeting at the edge of the skirt. Speaking of fabric I have no idea what these pieces will be made out of xx ahhAlso for a more formal look I am considering having a shirt pocket on the vest with a handkerchief and a pocket watch in one of the pockets which I didnt draw. What do you guys think? Is this prommy enough?Any and all feedback is appreciated IMMENSELY. Thank you guys SO much in advance I cant wait for your replies!,femalefashionadvice,crdb0tg,1,t5_2s8o5

4101134,0,t3_37lw0h,I think I have some fit problems with a lot of tops particularly buttonups that is emphasized if I try to tuck.Exhibit A I pin a lot of pics like this. I love the partially tucked look. Almost every fashion pic I see of a woman in some sort of buttonup has some seriously awesome tuck action.Exhibit B Heres a shirt that I own where I think the tuck kind of works. I love this shirt but its pretty casual.Exhibit C This shirt however perfectly illustrates my frustrations with tucking and I think it has to do with how most tops seem to fit me. This same effect seems to happen with my chambray shirt a few of my silkier shirts and pretty much any buttonup shirt I own. I usually need to size up a fair bit with buttonups to prevent them pulling across my hips justpearthings and then get them tailored. However I dont think tailoring is the silver bullet for my problems since the shirt pictured was tailored and taken in at the waist. Ive taken my buttonups to several tailors to the same end  they still seem baggy to me in the wrong places. What can I do to improve the fit? I love the fit of the Banana Republic fitted shirts off the rack but I dont like the noniron material. Is it possible to have my other shirts tailored to fit the same or a looser version of the same? What are the limitations presumably patterns and embellishments like the front pockets? Will this solve the tuck problems? Is there something Im overlooking?P.S.

4111357,0,t3_37qb62,Im going through a similar exercise for a  week trip starting in a month western Europe. I understand packing for specific cultural situations so keep those items.Will you not have any access to laundry all  weeks? Taking a lot of tops for really hot weather sounds smart but I honestly think you can cut down on the bottoms  you currently have  so youll wear each fewer than  times if you wear them evenly but Im sure youll find a few to be more versatile than others. And you also have dresses so theres days you wont wear the bottoms.What Im doing is picking mostly neutral bottoms light wash jeans navy skirt bluewhite patterned skirt and a blush skirt that Im on the fence about and picking out a lot more tops that go with most of these bottoms. Im not packing any tops that only go with one bottom. Packing at the lightest I could decide on I still had  totally different outfits so I know I can cut down a lot more. I anticipate doing laundry once a week or at most stretching it to  days so having  outfits is probably enough.What I did was put on each bottom and tried it with each top and counted how versatile each shirt was  not just in color but also in fitstyle with the bottom.Edit I also have a dress in the mix which Ill probably wear a couple of times.I anticipate having a lot of photos too and Id like to look nice in them so Im taking only things I really like and leaving behind plenty of other clothes that I do like.

4306128,0,t1_csazv6v,Sure theres a caveat to every situation. But the author of OPs article is proposing that women in general are behaving X in response to men in general... Its a totally different situation.FWIW I ask my husband if he likes certain things because it pleases me to consider his opinions. I think its annoying and kinda offensive that the author is implying that women in general need to consider the broad opinions of men regarding clothing choices. Not that you need the original point explained per se but in case anymore else is curious... Its really limiting to say I have to dress up to look good for men or dress down because I want men to ignore me. Those are my only options? I cant shop for dress downesqe clothes simply because it pleases me? I think uyogurtmeh is getting at that.,femalefashionadvice,csb0y35,12,t5_2s8o5

Its possible to change in the restroom I do this every day at work  I bike in casual shorts and a tshirt or jeanslayersetc depending on the weather and change into work clothes when I get there. I leave enough time and layer so that the first  minutes of my commute Im cold  that helps with not overdressing.

4361034,0,t3_3auvnn,Pack rat chiming in!Im getting ready to move out of state and Im a little devastated to deal with the sheer quantity of bullshit Ive wasted my money on over the years. On Monday I did a load of laundry that was just tights. The tights bin in my closet smelled a little funky. An entire load of tights. A paper grocery bag full of tights. Why the fuck do I have so many pairs of tights? How do I get rid of them? I cant donate tights right??I also have shoes. So many shoes. Last year I lined up my shoes side by side in the hallway of my house and I counted FIFTYFIVE PAIRS. I have such a casual sense of style why the fuck do I need  pairs of shoes?The other day someone asked whats in our underwear drawers and I was confronted with the question of WHY THE FUCK DO I HAVE LIKE  WEEKS OF UNDERWEAR? Mostly its  because Ive changed the kind I like to wear and then havent gotten rid of the ones I used to wear and now I cant bear to part with the American Apparel underwear I invested so much money in.This is seriously embarrassing for me. I have so much stuff in general too.  years ago I received a phone call letting me know that my apartment was on fire and I felt a tinge of relief. RELIEF. I was being offered an exit from having so much shit. Fortunately I didnt lose anything including priceless photos heirloom jewelry important documents etc. but I seriously cant believe that was my first reaction. Five years later and nothings changed. I bought The Joy of Less and havent read it. Theres something seriously wrong with me and something has got to change.So Im moving in  weeks. I refuse to let this problem follow me. Im selling as much as I can and donating the rest. Ive invested so much money in vintage clothes that I convinced myself were an investment that could easily be liquidated but that hasnt been the case. In the  years Ive lived in this apartment Ive walked to the nearest Buffalo Exchange and vintage clothing shop to sell and every time I come back with most of my shit. Im going to have to rent a car and take my shit to some of the bigger more vintagey vintage stores. I dont have the energy time or the space to have a sidewalk sale. Im a prisoner to my stuff.So to answer your question Ive been doing the reversecoathanger method for a while and now that Im getting ready to move Ive become more brutal. Doesnt suit my style or fit me NOW? Havent worn it in a year? Have others too similar to it? One of the reasons Im moving is to live a quieter social life so a bunch of my party dresses are going to have to go. Its heartbreaking to say goodbye to my adorable vintage mini dresses but Im going to keep my favorites. The ones that I can picture a yearold adult female wearing. An adult female who doesnt party as much as she used to. An adult female who isnt a prisoner to her shopping addiction.TLDR Move out of state and learn the painful lesson of being a shopping addict.ETA Im sharing a moving truck with a friend and I dont want him to see andor struggle with how much shit I have.,femalefashionadvice,csh80l4,3,t5_2s8o5

I have tons of corns on my feet and have loads of ankle foot problems over the years because of shoes that dont give enough support.The problem is that shoes that do have a lot of support are usually for middle aged women and are not very fashionable. For example the walking companyI have had the best luck with Steve Madden sandals from Nordstrom. You have to be careful because some Steve Madden sandals suck and are flimsy.

4551090,0,t1_ct49p1p,Im originally from the upper midwest and now live on the east coast.  The transition is pretty similar in terms of temperature  you seem to have clothing down and you might even feel that its a bit warmer overall.  The biggest difference is that the winters are less consistently frozen.  There are more temperature fluctuations due to proximity to the ocean and other weather factors.  Also bigger cities create more heat.Because of these things there is way more slush  the worst is when deep filthy slush puddles with ice chunks in them form on every street corner.  So some sort of boot that is both waterproof at least on the lower part and also lined to provide warmth will be best.  Otherwise you can easily ruin footwear.  Ive found that I rarely wear traditional snow boots however  I think this depends on what activities you will be doing or how snowy the winter is.,femalefashionadvice,ct4adsg,2,t5_2s8o5

4568887,0,t3_3df2v8,Its all about finding balance. The outfits that have more than one standout element that I like most are usually toned down in another way. For example     Bright colours are balanced with a straight line silhouette.  Sequins  cobalt in well tailored and fitted pieces. Note that although the pants and pumps are very neutral theyre not really bland.  Fur cuff fringe tote purple tassel shoes so much going on! Yet the colour scheme is subdued and the non standout items are neutral not dull.   I think in some cases only wearing one standout piece makes it stand out too much. Like omg thats so yellow but adding another element balances things out. Often piling it all on looks really busy to my eye but sometimes it can be really intriguing Note that there are a minimum number of pieces and each one is well tailored and fitted. ,femalefashionadvice,ct6iqnj,2,t5_2s8o5

4666243,0,t3_3etp13,You mentioned somewhere downthread that youre an artist. Generally and you probably are already aware of this the art community is MUCH more forgiving of weirdloudcostumey clothes. I got my bachelors in illustration and while I was at school walking into the art building was like walking into a hundred fashion shows at once. I dressed pretty tame in comparison studying there almost made me want to step up my game and buy like a tulle skirt or some velvet harem pants or some fuckin reptileeye contacts or something. As an artist youre in good company.That said you are also probably already aware that the more unusual loud and costumey the outfit the more attention it attracts both bad and good. If this attention is something you dislike or are trying to avoid then you have a decision to make which is more important wearing the clothing or avoiding attention? No judgement from me either way. Im someone who enjoys clothes but I dont want my outfit to be the centerpiece. However I have some aforementioned college art friends who consider dressing to be a more fluid and interactive form of art and want their outfit to be given as much attention and occasionally critique! as possible. ,femalefashionadvice,ctiqgbt,9,t5_2s8o5
4669724,0,t1_ctj3aa4,I dont have any recommendations within that budget but I think that a lot of crotch wear and tear can be repaired rather than just throwing out your old jeans. It actually look me a long time to figure this out but repairs dont need to be invisible. You can have some crazy sewing work on the crotch area and NO ONE WILL SEE IT. You need some serious crotch to face interaction for it to be visible to anyone. You can take your jeans to a tailor if you dont have any sewing experience and ask if they can do a repair. If you do have a sewing machine what I do is have a really old pair of jeans that I cut up and use for my patch. The patch goes on the inside of the pants because a huge patch might actually be noticeable and then I zigzag stitch all over the worn or ripped area so that the hole does not continue expanding.

I also wear orthotics for high arches and supination which helps but its worth noting that a shoe needs to have a pretty solid arch for my orthotic to even fit in it.

Instead I would advise that you buy jewelry or accessories. If you know her taste a handbag can be great or a beautiful necklace. If you give a budget i can help recommend.

4715152,0,t1_ctod73e,Where do you shop? I live in Ontario and Im having trouble finding stores that sell good quality clothing  which I assume this is based on price,femalefashionadvice,ctovtoe,2,t5_2s8o5
4716819,0,t1_ctovtoe,I actually bought a lot of my stuff online at ASOS some of it was the ASOS brand itself which I like for the most part but a lot of the brands I could have also purchased here in TorontoOntario. For example one of the wool coats I got was from ESPRIT.  You can find this brand and lots of other great brands at The Bay.  When I was little I used to think The Bay was just old womans clothing but they actually have a lot of good stuff if you look in the right sectionsbrands.  Additionally The Bay at larger mallscities such as Eatons will have much better selection. For regular clothes or very specific styles AA is also my usual stop. I have an SPC card which gives me  off but I will usually only shopstock up during sales where you can get  off like the friends amp family sales they often have or even up to  off.  I also have a friend who works there so I can get  off if she happens to be working.  I know this doesnt apply to everyone but its what I do.  As always be a smart shopper when buying from here.  If its something thats very basic Ill probably Ill probably go to a somewhere else that sells more practical clothing and is less fashion oriented.  If Im looking for a basic that I know I will wear a lot andor something in a very particular style that I cant easily find anywhere else for the same level of quality I never buy F dupes of AA its just shitty quality in my opinion. Generally I think going to places known for good stylequality and really taking the time to look at the clothing feeling the fabric and looking at how its made will help you better find pieces that will last you longer.  If it feels like its not the very best you can get dont get it.  And if you think it is something you might want to purchase look up the brand read reviews use the resources you have like FFA. Lastly for good measure in case you didnt already do this dont buy things like shoes at a general clothing store like HampM.  Dont buy clothing at stores that generally focus on accessories.  Dont buy bras at a place that is mainly regular clothing.  These items are there to make money not give you the best quality possible.  That being said I really like specialty stores stores that just focus on one thing and do it really well.  For example I got the most perfect pair of jeans in the fashion district at a store that only sells jeans.  Staff was knowledgeable guided me through that too look for and knew what I needed.  Its like buying a plant at a local nursery vs. the grocery store.,femalefashionadvice,ctp3dlq,4,t5_2s8o5

Just that cut is emphasizing things in an unattractive way which ought to rather be emphasized for how awesome they are. Like your curvy figure and awesome tiny waist. The shape at the waist is just a tad boxy for you and the bust is too small.You need a size larger absolutely. Vintage doesnt  skin tight but rather well fitted. If it is indeed a bit loose probably correct you should have it tailored to fit. This is why those vintage fashions looked so glam.

Im hoping to pick up a couple more higher quality pairs now that I know how much I love them.  I do love a good statement necklace. I have a couple of ubiquitous pieces from J.Crew which I get loads of compliments on and a few ForeverFrancescas type pieces in a more art deco style. I also have some really great pendants made from raw stones and silver dipped animal skulls. Im extremely picky about how my necklaces hang where they hit on my neck and how they interact with my neckline. A necklace must touch only fabric or only skin it can never cross the boundary. I love the look of a cute necklace over a buttonup.  I absolutely never wear bracelets even though I have some Bakelite ones I love and an amazing s charm bracelet. They just annoy me. I do wear a Cartier watch my mom gave me fairly often. I got it sized quite snug so it doesnt move around it makes me feel fancy and classy. I am trying to temporarily curb my jewelrybuying habit.

4858084,0,t1_cu6rldl,hi I have a leather jacket from Muubaa so maybe I can help! Im  usually wear a UK on top US . My jacket which is a similar style to the ones you linked is a UKUS and I think it fits well. Its not super fitted like some styles but I wanted to be able to wear a jumper underneath it. Also the sleeves are a little long so I usually roll them a bit but maybe I have short arms. heres a pic.the quality is pretty good  this is the first leather jacket Ive ever owned so I dont have much to compare it to. Ive had it for over a year and its aging nicely although fading from true black to a slight grey in places which I kind of like. I was a bit like you waiting ages for my dream jacket to come along and then I decided to just go for it with this one since it was on a good sale at a price and I dont regret it at all. ,femalefashionadvice,cu6wbyj,5,t5_2s8o5

Weve also gone shopping for jeans for her and it was a disaster.And trust me weve argued about this exact point before because I dont particularly enjoy the minimalist look. Its not my personal style and I dont care much for it  but I can also see how fit is huge and if an article of clothing doesnt fit correctly then its not going to look good. The look is very intentional and usually involves quite a bit of thought into how its articulated in an outfit.Keep in mind this is coming from someone who is really into preppy twee. ,femalefashionadvice,cu9rw41,12,t5_2s8o5

4991851,0,t3_3j8e04,this is fascinating ive loved reading everybodys responses in this thread.    for me... its taken a long while to have a solid perception of myself but thats probably really normal tbh. especially for young people. i think everyone goes through awkward stages and this is often reflected in fashion. like that post about peoples style evolution during adolescence... im MUCH more judgemental about what i looked like back then but when i look at other peoples photos i just think oh they were teenagers.   theres sort of this battle between projecting who we are and projecting who we WANT to be or want other people to see us as. and sometimes i think its necessary for us to be inauthentic and that isnt necessarily a bad thing per se. selling out vs survival? especially when youre a young professional like a lot of people here trying to look older and get a job.    but if taken too far yeah i guess it can be defensive dressing clothing as protection or a way to hide parts of yourself.    i can see that in ways i used to dress. i was never THAT insecure about my body because ive been very lucky in that regard... but i was deeply insecure about my gender and my sexual orientation and that came across in a pendulum swing between hypermasculine and hyperfeminine styles of dressing.    depression also affected the way i dressed  lots of black at times lots of stuff that just didnt FIT right or look good but i didnt care about myself or my body. i saw my own body as a prison i wanted to escape.     now im sloooowly coming to terms with being notstraight and its okay to be female and to be me. and my style has calmed down as a result.    on a less personal note theres the whole what not to wear thing and ever since i stopped telling myself im pearshaped with giant thighs and therefore i cant wear this this and this im MUCH happier.  ,femalefashionadvice,cunpd14,7,t5_2s8o5
4996973,0,t1_cuo9s02,Yes but its less about the piece itself and more about the colors with me. I often get complimented when Im wearing colors that I think look hideous on me such as light warm blues blush tones navy and black. Black is particularly baffling to me because I think it makes me look pale and dead but for some reason when its worn as outerwear black jacket instead of my preferred warm gray or camel jacket it apparently really perks me up and looks great? It makes me reconsider my tastes and biases because Im seriously bad at determining what works on me if my extensive makeup collection is any indication and Ive kept items and worn them more frequently because lots of people cant all be wrong can they?? ,femalefashionadvice,cuobleb,6,t5_2s8o5

5038058,0,t1_cut83lm,Dont bother with Uniqlo silk and cashmere. Their silk feels crappy and their cashmere basically feels like crappy merino wool. Everlane has much nicer silk. You can also buy silk shirts of ebay. Equipment is a good brand. I also love Vince.I have heard good things about Everlanes cashmere but I havent ever touched it. I actually really like Bloomingdales in house cashmere collection. I usually buy it on sale but its very nice. You can also look for cashmere at places like Nordstrom Rack or Saks Off Fifth but I would make the effort to look for items that were sent from the regular stores and not items that are only sold from the outlet stores. The outlet items can be kind of shitty so you want to avoid them. I dont know how to tell the difference with Off Fifth but with Nordstrom Rack apparently if the price is written in pen on the tag it was probably sent from a regular Nordstrom. If the price is printed on the tag it was made for the outlet store.Oh people here have also been buying Grana recently. I dont know much about the brand but maybe someone can give information.

5086095,0,t3_3ko1em,I dont have a good answer but Id also like to hear solutions especially ones that dont take way more effort than theyre worth. Selling online takes a lot of work and usually you dont make much in return. Although eBay isnt so bad IMO and its still probably your best bet for NWT items. rwardrobepurge is a nice idea but haggling over bundles shipping Paypal fees... Im ashamed to say that Ive tried to do it and burned out before I could actually make a deal. But its still better than Craigslist.Consigning is awkward watching someone else paw through your stuff and judge your taste by things you dont even want anymore and although it is less work than online you also probably get paid less. People are willing to pay higher prices to an establishment like a store but you probably get less than half of what your items sell for. Platos Closet is the worst because theyre SO corporate and their prices are SO low. Its a little easier for juniors pieces but UGH the judgement. A lot of the time I just end up hanging onto things until I get frustrated and dump them all at Goodwill. So yeah sorry for the rant.

5105600,0,t1_cv1atqp,Natural redhead here. I fall somewhere between Julianne Moore and Amy Adams. Im more of a Julianne when I dabble with henna... Like most redheads I feel best in earthy tones and some jewel tones like emerald. These colors definitely make up the bulk of my wardrobe. The contrast gives my hair a lot of umph that I like. Personally I do like to wear some redbased colors like pinks burgundies and brownstans. If the shade is a lot darker or lighter than my hair i.e. a tan or light pink I generally do not have a problem. If the shade is closer to my hair color then it can make my hair look dull especially if my hair is right next to the color like in a shirt or a scarf. Browns are definitely the most challenging for me to wear. Ive never had a problem wearing pink. Blues purples are typically good for me. Results may vary with oranges. It might take some time to get used to the color. You are going to be hyper sensitive to some of the color combinations for awhile. Also when Ive hennad my hair the first week or so was really vibrant. You might feel more comfortable as it fades a bit. ,femalefashionadvice,cv1eylc,1,t5_2s8o5

5115296,0,t3_3l215d,For those who remember me talking about him being sick my grandfather passed away. We went to Disney like we were supposed to and had a fantastic trip. Two days after we get back Friday hes transported to hospice care. My mom called me last night and told me that he passed away in his sleep. I decided to go visit on Sunday about a . hour drive because I knew that I might not get the chance to ever see him again. Im glad I went. It was so hard so very hard. When I first went into the room I started crying. I just stood up against the back wall and cried. The only person I could look at was my grandmother. We held hands and hugged. Everyone started walking out to let me have some time with him. I couldnt do it. I started to bawl and walked right out and down to the bathroom. Then I came back. Because I knew I just knew that this would be the last time I saw him on this earth. I started crying again and my aunt walked me over to him and got his hand and held it out for me. I cant remember the last time I held his hand before Sunday. His hands are so big! Then I just started talking to him. And he held my hand. Tight. He didnt let go. So I didnt either. Im not sure how much time I spent with him but I stood at his bed and then bent over and then squatted and then stood on my knees. My aunt brought me a pillow for me to put my knees on I was there that long. I had both of his hands at one point and then he lifted one of them and my aunt held that one. I gave him lots of kisses he had just gotten a shave and smelled so good told him I loved him and told him to rest. Gave him some more kisses before I left told him that I loved him and thanked him for being an awesome granddaddy. Then I left. I had to go buy chocolate and cookies and wine after I left him and my family. My mom called me last night about  and told me that he went in his sleep. Which is really what we had all wanted. So after I had a good cry I had a mimosa in a can. Its amazing! The funeral is Thursday. Im not going to wear black Im going to wear grey. I have some purple bracelets but I want some yellow ones. Yellow was his favorite color. I might get a small yellow flower for my hair. Im trying to keep busy at work and stay focused.

After taking pictures at home Ill be returning the Pixie pants. I think they are too short on me for regular length pants. I like the Loft jeans and since black jeans are fine for my job Ill be keeping them. The orangish shirt is the Utility blouse from The Loft which people had also suggested. I think its a keeper and I might try to pick up another in a different color.I also tried on Editor pants from Express As with many pants kind of tight at the belly but gaping at the back. I did not buy them yay for not buying what doesnt fully fit my needs and not buying just to buy!. I also passed on the Express Portofino blouse that so many people seem to like. I just found the material to be really cold and the elbows didnt fit me with the sleeves rolled up.What Im really struggling with still always forever is shoes. Ive got  pairs of shoes at home from Zappos waiting to be returned. Not pictured are a pair of Vivobarefoot Gobi II in black leather which is fine because they just looked like flippers on my feet.

It makes me enjoy clothing much more than I would otherwise. When I was younger stuff like this made me feel like a bad feminist but I guess as Ive gotten older I dont think about things in that context.,femalefashionadvice,cvpnvo2,28,t5_2s8o5

5338218,0,t3_3o2csr,Wooo wall of text ahead. This was really nice and reflective thanks for that. How I Used to Dress. My previous fashion sense could best be summed up as I dont really care that much. Ive never really been poorly dressed in that people would look at me and think negatively but I rarely looked good either. My daily uniform consisted mostly of Tshirts and skinny jeans. Ive always been a Plain Jane and my attitude towards fashion was basically Meh. Its just clothes and makeup. I never felt confident OR insecure about my appearance. Instead I was very detached. I looked the way I looked and at the end of the day I didnt care. During this time my favorite clothes usually had some sort of sentimental value. I had a Lucky Green TShirt forest green Vneck that I wore when I needed a little oomph. This attitude lasted basically all through middle school high school and the first half of college.. My impression varied from person to person. I remember my father saying to me You dont have to be so goddamn bohemian theres nothing wrong with wanting to look pretty! And I agreed theres absolutely nothing wrong with putting effort into your appearance! I just didnt care about it myself. Men have always left me alone as I am easy to gloss over in a crowd of done up pretty ladies. This was a blessing and a curse. Ive been able to avoid a lot of street harassment but always felt like boys overlooked me in favor of my friends. The biggest thing was this weird initial hurdle in meeting people where Id have to prove I wasnt the boring goodytwoshoes I appeared to be. That was really frustrating. I wanted to appear as a blank slate so that my personality would shine through but instead people just saw a blank slate and thought Boring goodygoody.. When I learned there are clothing options besides FastFashion Fringe Fashion and Target TShirts everything changed. I realized that I could dress in a way that embodied OrphansBenefit rather than bending OrphansBenefit to fit fashion. Then I started to fall in love with clothes almost as art pieces. Im very interested in color theory and proportion so learning about what colors cuts and styles fit me was a lot of fun! So I guess in a way I still wasnt really motivated by a desire to look better. I was motivated to look more like me. And the fact that its basically a giant art project made it really enjoyable!. I spent a lot of time on FFA and also carefully putting together my pinterest. I made sure that everything I pinned felt like me. Ive basically concluded that my style is DepressionEra Earthy Witch Princess. Or like an embodiment of Johanna Newsoms Cosmia. I want to look like the sweet princess that can also curse you and climb mountains and plough a field with a baby on her hip. Classic with a bit of grit. Something like that.. The biggest struggle is unlearning all the stuff Ive been taught about settling. My mom always viewed clothes as something you buy just to cover yourself and pretty things are reserved for other people. Ive kind of picked up a lot of the same thoughts over the years thinking that it would be dumb for me to spend any money on beautiful clothes. Realizing that its okay to spend a bit more on something I love is tough. I tend to manage the discomfort by buying mostly used. That way I get exactly what I want but at a price Im comfortable with. Also Im poor so its not like I have much choice. PHow I Currently Dress. My alltime favorite piece are my boots that kind of look like this I feel very much like myself when I wear them and they make me happy. I hope to one day have a wardrobe that brings me as much joy as these boots do!. I think I give off a lot of the same impressions but thats just because Ive barely started curating my wardrobe. Up until last month I was living paycheck to paycheck! I can see that Im making progress towards my goal but its slow going and hasnt really been noticeable to anyone else yet. But I can see where Im going and Im excited to get there.,femalefashionadvice,cvu0lit,2,t5_2s8o5

5374537,0,t1_cvykper,I usually go for color correcting my dark circles. Depending on how purple or blue they look I use either NYX concealer wand in yellow or Missha perfect concealer in natural beige  which is actually an orangey peach on me. I then apply a concealer that resembles my skin tone more closely haha. I also like Benefit Erase paste but it usually needs to be set and my undereyes seem not to like powder too much. But with regards to color and coverage its great and some day I could use it on its own because of the peachy undertones kind of like a  in  yay!. The Bobbi Brown is the usual recommendation of MUA but I didnt use it as to give a correct opinion. I also have a green one NYX jar but cant really bother with it. When I really have plenty of time I use it around my nose. However my redness is not too bad most of the time so YMMV. I also kinda want to buy the NYX lavender wand one to correct any yellowness  but I think its just a gotta catch them all mindset since I dont really have anything yellow Id need to counteract...

5379213,0,t1_cvz93bc,Thats a really good question for me I definitely associate a defined style as a cohesive theme for my wardrobe which fits in and around my lifestyle and myself as a person.  For example goth ninja is an obvious example that springs to my mind and it evokes a sense of very dark shadows and playing with silhouettes and textures.  As much as I would love to be an amazing swishy assassin that would not work for me or my lifestyle it is not a style for me.  However that does not prohibit me from incorporating certain elements into my own and adjusting accordingly.  Modern classic is a good starting place certainly.

5400462,0,t3_3p05up,Can we talk about workwear for a second?Many people here seem to be pretty inexperienced when it comes to dressing appropriately for work. And thats fine its a learning curve just like anything else and its probably why a lot of people are here. But you will do yourself a huge favor if you recognize that owning your bizarre clueless or inappropriate outfit is not the answer to getting ahead in the world of work. Sometimes the answer is actually to take advice from other people even if you disagree with it. It can come as a shock and a disappointment to realize how conservative uncreative and unwavering a lot of workwear rules can be. No dress code just means is that the dress rules are unwritten not that there arent any. People see no dress code as progress over the suited era of past decades but I find it more infuriating because its harder to know how to hit the right note. Yes Im sure someone has come to your office in pajamas before and yes Im sure plenty of people do wear flip flops. Ive seen it myself. But in a lot of places now youll only find out that you screwed up if a coworker calls you aside or if you get weird looks or if you start getting passed over for projects. Thats most likely the reason that no ones called you out on your work outfit before youve posted it here. Its not that everyone here is backwards its that your colleagues and supervisors expect you to just know how to dress even though they never told you and they assume this is just how youve chosen to dress. The rare person who does call you in for a private chat to talk about your appearance is doing you a favor.You have the right to dress the way you want at work in that no ones going to arrest you for it but you also have the responsibility to your company your coworkers and yourself to put your best foot forward. Younger employees particularly women have a hard enough time climbing a career ladder. Dont make it even harder on yourself. ,femalefashionadvice,cw1yw2a,95,t5_2s8o5

5428996,0,t1_cw5i1wm,I have done a TV anchor gig a while back and although my current career has nothing to do with that here is what I would recommendBasically you want a generic inoffensive elegant and appropriate look.Everything needs to be crisp and pressed  ironed even if its knitwear although knitwear is best avoided. Take a buttondown from your wardrobe and photograph it when it is not freshly pressed vs. when it is the difference is striking. A freshly pressed white buttondown is exceptionally chic when accessorized with a nice necklace and earrings and stylish hair.Obviously nothing can be too small in the chest. Use doublesided tape for button downs if need be. Your bras can never show through your blouse. Stick to clean silhouettes camera does add lbs and last thing you want is some ruffles adding more. Avoid prints it is really hard to pull them off on camera.In terms of clothing types you want classics blazers buttondown shirts simple dress pants sheath dresses pencil skirts. Definitely nothing too formfitting or too tight.Bright colors are good although there are some shades of red and orange that can look fluorescent on camera but studios usually know what particular shades to avoid. I personally think black is best avoided and replaced with navy.Accessories should be small. Pearl studs pearl necklaces are ok simple golden studs also. Maybe you can get away with say sapphire earrings if they are not too blingy. Generally some neckline is exposed I am not talking cleavage and pearl necklaces or simple ones made of precious metals work with that.Have good classic makeup and hair hair needs to be styled I am not talking sprayed until it is of cement texture but at least blow dried with a round brush welldefined eyebrows are all the rage now and you will want at least mascara blush and lipstick  and possibly more. Current makeup trends of contouring generally produce a welldefined face on camera. Nothing has to be bright but the idea is to make facial features more defined.Pay attention to details no missing buttons scuffed shoes that need to be reheeled loose threads etc.Most of the clothing you see on TV broadcasters is not designer no one wants some bright DampG flowers distracting viewers some smaller stations would often be sponsored by a local boutique or just work with a couple of local stores so there is not much choice actually.For a European broadcaster style google image Claire Chazal. She has a very nice style which is admired by many in France.,femalefashionadvice,cw5lyri,13,t5_2s8o5

Maybe you are struggling to conceive maybe you are completely infertile due to previous chemotherapy maybe you are afraid to have children due to history of sexual abuse maybe you are child free maybe its not the right time.

Mummy bags are supposed to fit comfortably tight if they are too baggy you are losing heat to the environment. Women tend to be shorter than men and are shaped more like a diamond wider hips than shoulder and men more like a triangle. So the shape is different. What i found intriguing was when the guy told me that the temp ratings were not the same. As in a zero degree bag for women is warmer than a zero degree mens bag.

I do know eventually I should replace them but two of the styles are quite unique and no longer available.Id like to take them to a cobbler and see if there is anything they can do. The main problems seems to be cleaning the leather is not as stiff as it once was droop some at the ankle and general wear and tear. Have any of you had success having boots in this condition spruced up? What types of questions or instructions should I give my cobbler? What things can I realistically not expect to be fixable?

Like the dress you linked has a big block of white over the shoulders which is an attentiongrabby color s that emphasizes them. But if the colors were inverted so that the dress had white stripes on a dark field that would deemphasize the shoulders for similar reasons.There might be some effects due to the horizontal stripes as well but its not as straightforward as just saying horizontal stripes make something look wider,femalefashionadvice,cx6fgum,3,t5_2s8o5

5953621,0,t3_3wsra3,My feet are narrow technically a . N also  sometimes also known as A but I am also a .  My heels are significantly narrower than my toes and I have high arches.  The combination has caused me to walk out of older shoes when the heel stretches on Park Ave and  run back barefoot to get them because ankles could not stay in and my toesparts of the balls of my feet were the only thing really able to hold my feet to the ground.For whatever the reason it is really difficult to find shoes of all sorts in my actual size on a regular basis and I often resort to reading tons of reviews about the cut shape and fits of shoes when I buy alongside having a mild preference for European brands and sizing they seem to be cut more narrowly on a regular basis.Because historically its been so difficult to find shoes my gait overemphasizes using my toes to grip my shoes I have weaker ankles than I should and I tend not to be  sure how to fit many kinds of shoes by myself.Recently I bought a pair of boots from Ariat the Yorks via Zappos.While they arent my favorite looking boots in the world they were the closest look to what I wanted a relatively flat riding boot that could go to casual to almost formal and the reviews mentioned that the shaft and the box for the foot ran narrow which apparently is normal for ariat.  When I finally got them the shaft arch and toebox fit perfectly.I have slippage in the heel.  I know that some heel slippage is normal in boots otherwise you wont be able to walk in them but because I have weak ankles Im nervous around any slippage.Its been  years since I bought boots that were lower like this and my previous pair is no longer made in my size otherwise I would buy it again thanks La Canadienne.  I honestly dont knowdont remember how boots are supposed to fitfeel when trying them on in the heel.How much slippage is normal?  How much slippage is I should return these?  How much slippage is these otherwise fit perfectly just get inserts in the heels to decrease slippage?Did I mention this is why I hate buying shoes...I wish I had normal feet,femalefashionadvice,cy01t9v,1,t5_2s8o5

It was truly amazing.  We drove all  miles of it...camped two nights and stayed in Asheville one night.  October is a SUPER busy month for the BRP and Shenandoah and Great Smoky Mountains so I definitely recommend trying to plan your trip to allow you to be there during the week...its much less crowded during the week than on weekends.

6104340,0,t1_cyjhsym,You should consider getting the inner thigh reinforced by a tailor or learning how to do it yourself or you can also get them repaired when you start noticing signs of too much damage. The thing about inner thigh repairs is that they dont look that pretty upon close inspection but who the fuck is closely inspecting the inner thigh of your jeans as you are wearing them? Repairs to that area are virtually unnoticeable when you wear them so if this is a common issue for you you should definitely look into repairing jeans. Also because it doesnt have to be pretty its an inexpensive repair. ,femalefashionadvice,cyji1w2,25,t5_2s8o5

6119660,0,t3_3zc8wb,I was pretty disappointed with both consultants I have had paid Boston and unpaid Nordstroms. I think planning a shopping trip with a close friend after figuring out what she wants  through pinteresting or other methods described here is a better use of time and money. The friend doesnt necessarily need to be into fashion as much as completely honest with what does and does not look good.There are a lot of components of fashion that really cant be addressed in  hours with a consultant. If you are looking for a particular thing like business suits it can be helpful. However a whole overhaul while trying to determine the right colors cuts fits sizes and silhouettes and adhering to her personal style preferences is difficult.

6153138,0,t3_3znyqc,One thing I do to achieve the artsy look with all black is to use same tone jewelry thats not too delicate. Think geometrical shapes or raw material like leather. I like a black necklace over a black sheet dress or some black leather bracelets I got from BR I fell in love with leather bracelets when I saw Donna Karan wearing themAnother thing I do is to wear my black dress with interesting tights in black. The tights are black but they have a different texture or pattern not just opaque or transparent blackThe third thing I do is use big scarves around my neck with either geometrical prints in greyblackdark shades  or with artsy prints splash of colors are Ok as long as there is some blackgrey on the scarf as well.

I was thinking of making a post to address the fact that recently pinteresty has become a trendy critique on FFA to the point where some posters are getting the impression that pinterest is out or uncool. But pinterest is just a tool! Will scrapbooks or bulletin boards ever go out of style? No. Not really. Maybe what people put inon them will but the medium itself? No why should it?

6170199,0,t1_cyqz544,Oh. Im going to say that maybe that was the problem.  I would actually be mildly annoyed if someone walked away from the poo even for  minutes or an hour because in that hour I could totally walk around out there and step in it. I do not look at the ground when I walk and I dont want to have to spend any time or effort worrying if theres a land mine and my neighbor is at the beginning or end of their walk. Where you are in your walk is not my responsibility kwim?  So when we walk I pick up the poo when it happens and carry it around with me.  Gross I know but I dont think its fair to leave it any amount of time so that Im bothered less and potentially someone else is bothered.  I know some people who pick it up on the way back but its just my opinion thats not really cool.But yeah I get that you are picking it up so you are already about a thousand times better than most and they must have been really busybodies to time you.

No. But wearing things like this x per week would probably be fine assuming you dressed more traditionally the other days think plain button up slacks pencil skirt suit with nice leather shoes. That said Portland is probably the most casual of all of the major west coast cities. Would these items be good in Seattle? Nope. SF? Nope.

6207888,0,t1_cyv27u1,I am wearing Lolita Fashion in my freetime too but I am working in a field where I have to wear at least business casual if not full suit. Mostly when I am in the office I wear preppy and mix a supersmall! hint of cuteness in it. I could imagine wearing preppy with a hint of goth could work too however I can recommend you to just keep it a really really small hint of goth. However there are always things in every subculture which can be coordinated with an office coord easily. You also might want to check out business goth or corporate goth  youll find many inspirations there on pinterest.For myself I started wearing decent cardigans or jackets or bags from lolita brands. Stuff like this in black not as a rucksack just as a bag in black something like this jacket and similar things.... however whenever I pick a fancy item Ill try to keep everything else super toned down. Yes this might be boring but then again I am going to work and not to a meetup anyway. What you have to keep in mind is that those clothes are made for a coordination with clothes which have a different cut than the usual everyday clothes. E.g. the waist sits a bit higher than with other cardis so it might look a bit off when wearing it with normal business clothes. Try it out at home at first and be brutally honest with yourself.You also can work with makeup a bit but even here I would recommend to tone it down a bit at first. ,femalefashionadvice,cyv9qf3,2,t5_2s8o5

6210762,0,t1_cyviyg3,Wear good quality shoes. If theyre cheap youll wind up having far more issues with your feet. Avoid pointytoe shoes or any shoes with a narrow toe area since thats the shape that winds up pushing your big toe out of alignment. Also you can stretch out your feet at the end of the day which can help. You can take a small loop of elastic put it around your two big toes then stretch your feet apart. Hold that for about  seconds and repeat  or  times. This will gently pull your big toe away from your foot and strengthen some of the small muscles in your feet which can counter some of the pressure the heel was causing. ,femalefashionadvice,cyvlhon,2,t5_2s8o5

It looks for some reason to me like youre small on top and overpowering on bottom possibly because of the combination of the big assertive shoes which again I like very much! and the shorter hemmed shirt.  You have this fantastic long line to you and I think a slightly longer shirt would draw attention to that.,femalefashionadvice,cywtbfo,4,t5_2s8o5
6221999,0,t3_40qoff,Gap TShirts hold up really well for me as do Nordstroms Caslon brand.  I have some  year old Caslons that look fine and still have their shape.  Im on a super tight budget so I try and grab them on sale or at the Rack but given how well they hold up Id be okay paying full price if I had to.  My Gap tees are or  years old and going strong too. I use the Nordstrom house brands a lot I have things that are really old but look fine even cardigans from the Brass Plum brands b.p. frenchi and rubbish I think.  I will say that any of the Abound stuff Ive bought on the cheap is total crap and I dont recommend it.,femalefashionadvice,cywvh08,4,t5_2s8o5

6296747,0,t3_41v2od,I think my fashion philosophy is in the middle of a shift. For several years its been buy ALL the things because I didnt have much that I liked and I hate hate hate not having the right clothes for a situation. I needed clothes that werent running shorts for grad school and I was trying to buy enough to cover all my bases formalitywise in addition to building a wardrobe practically from scratch. I felt like shopping was always on my todo list I didnt buy everything at once mostly because I waited for sales but I bought some stuff often and then Id buy whatever caught my eye.Now for the first time ever Im pretty content with my wardrobe. Sure there are holes but now I have a specific list of things I want. I no longer feel the need to always be shopping  in fact Im trying to keep to the one in one out rule and I like my current clothes enough that its hard to choose which one would go out. I think part of this is having plenty of clothes that I like and part of it is getting better at making the right outfit for a situation from the options that I have. Eventually Id like to have fewer clothes than I have now but for the moment its something of a security blanket to have lots of options.Oddly enough I dont feel like my style has changed through this process Ive just gotten better about knowing what that style is and how to get there. Ive always liked a very simple slightly preppy look New England prep not Southern prep. I realized that I had a color palette by accident when doing my laundry when everything I owned was black white blue green or purple. The only thing that has really changed is that I dress more seasonally now both in terms of color and by putting clothes away for a season or two so theyre fresh the next year.,femalefashionadvice,cz5dacp,7,t5_2s8o5

I thought maybe Id share a little about why we made Capsules amp who we see it being for. I started working on Capsules after  this  post last year and  I tried to make a capsule wardrobe with my wife last winter. youre right that there are a lot of free resources out there but theyre geared to people who want to do a ton of research or are already fashionably disposed. Capsules is really targeting busy women who wantneed more guidance through the process. Ill admit the app is pretty stripped down right now  but were releasing new features every other week for the next  months so hopefully that will help. FEATURE RELEASE IN ORDER Color palette guidance based on your hair skin eye color item recommendations based on what is best flattering for your build help in choosing clothes that are appropriate for the different environments in your life and a daily outfit recommender. If there are features that you want to see sooner please let me know  or something you feel were missing Id love to hear it. In the future we want to move to a freemium service so people can try out some of the features before they pay  we just need to build it up a little bit first. Hope that was helpful and not too salesey. Thanks again for bringing it up! ,femalefashionadvice,cz6gw3h,2,t5_2s8o5

I can imagine that its likely to happen with something like a watch since its worn regularly and moves around with your hands. When the finishing tarnishes you can have the item replated. But then youll have to see if they do a good job or not I imagine a watch is more difficult to replate and more expensive. I personally have not had anything replated before I own goldplated jewelry that has worn off but they were not worth the hassle of finding a jeweller to have replated.,femalefashionadvice,czmcwll,1,t5_2s8o5

The first is by Just Female and is super oversized the model is  inches taller than I am so it should be a similar fit.The second one is by American Apparel and has no buttons. I can also get a small discount on it because Im a student or wait for a sale.

6548473,0,t3_45akyi,Maybe just try to google the specific pants when youre looking at them in the store and see where they were sold before. I think that if they have a lot of the item thats a sign its been made for the store. Jeans are harder to tell but with tops I think you can get a good gauge of quality by just by inspecting the item. How does the fabric feel? Is it thin and flimsy? Or sturdier? What is the material? Look for pure wool cashmere cotton linen silk etc. Or if a blend from a reputable designer and you like the item how much of it is viscose poly or rayon? hopefully very little. How is the stitching? When you pull at a seam how much of the thread can you see? Most importantly how is the fit? Does it hang nicely?  You can also inspect the high quality items at the full price stores and compare them to the items you find in the second market retailers just for an idea of what you should be looking for. Also  retailers like TJMaxx Nordstrom Rack and Marshalls dont carry as much of the cheaply made brands as the outlet stores do. A J Crew outlet store for instance is about  low quality items  legit J Crew. But the bigger stores especially Nordstrom Rack are more likely to stock offbrand clothes made especially for the store  with weird labels youve never heard of that are crap interspersed with past season designer labels. Again  just be wary of the designer items that have a lot of sizes. ,femalefashionadvice,czwnz4x,5,t5_2s8o5

6700978,0,t1_d0ccoe8,Okay oh god this may be long. Im on mobile so feel free to ask about anything that is unclear.  Refinements are your friend. An easy way to filter out of the China is to check the box that makes it stuff located in US only. I do this for everything I buy because there are a lot of counterfeit items sometimes and its easier ordering from the US anyway. Use followed searches for things you want. You can make it as vague or as specific as youd like. I have one search that is just Prada shoes size  sorted by price low to high. When its vague theres a lot more that comes through your followed search. On one hand it can be a lot of junk to sort through on the other hand you can find something awesome quickly that you may not otherwise see if you were more specific. An example of a more specific search I have is silk j crew collection dress size  under  listed from low to high. Also understand that while more refinements can be convenient it can also accidentally filter out things that technically fit it. Like if you refined it to show shoes that are red you may not see some red shoes that the seller didnt fill in the details for so it effectively gets filtered out.  Have a clear idea of what you want. Obviously black helmut lang dress will be easier to navigate than dress. Literally go to Barneys or Nordstrom or whatever and go wild. Pretend your father invented toaster strudel and youre loaded. Try on all the fancy things you want but take notes. This is how Ive learned what sizes I am in fancy brands and its saved me a lot of frustration. Its also fun to do and helped me realize things like hey I actually dont like a DVF wrap dress I need to size up a lot in Burberry coats and Hugo Boss is not as amazing as I expected it to be.  The eBay mobile app is literally the best app I have ever used for anything ever. Its so well done. I highly recommend it. Do your research on how much an item goes for by clicking the sold tab thing. Itll show you the stuff that fits your search that sold recently. Its a good way to gauge how much an item should cost and normally goes for.  If its too good to be true it probably is. Take risks that you feel comfortable with. I bought a pair of Stewart Weitzman over the knee boots for  and with a good polish they ended up looking brand new. I was okay with risking the  and it ended up paying off. If it didnt pay off I wouldnt have cared much.  Understand what is easily faked. Hermes items are faked a lot. Handbags are faked a lot. On highly faked items only go with a trusted seller or see above. I prefer to buy clothes since they arent usually faked but be careful to make sure youre not buying a Rag and Bone for Target when you want a regular Rag and Bone  thankfully the label itself will tell you this so its not that hard.  I personally like to check pre owned items because theres a lot of stuff thats lightly worn that are automatically cheaper because the tags arent on them and theyre not new without tags. Theres a lot of Wore it a few times want to get rid of it.Ebay completely changed my style helped my wallet and just made me way happier with my choices on many levels. I feel like ffa is constantly buying a lot of midlevel brands that dont necessarily suck in terms of the things they sell but suck in terms of how much they charge for it. I also feel like a lot of people on ffa arent happy about the places they shop but feel like its their only option price wise. I used to shop at the mall all the time especially sales on sales but honestly I dont even go to the mall anymore. Im over seeing a crap ton of cheap Polyester thats made in China listed at like  before any sales and wont wear well over time. There are obviously some exceptions to the quality thing but not enough exceptions to make the whole okay in my opinion. Theres literally a Rag and Bone dress Im thinking about buying right now for   that isnt as affordable as thrifting but its crazy affordable compared to what I would spend at BananaJ Crewother mall brands. Granted if Im thrifting and I see a cute J Crew top for a couple bucks Ill buy it but that price is much easier to swallow for the quality. My friends laugh at me in a goodnatured way because I only buy designer dahling but Im not spending any more than they do on their Forever HampM hauls and theyre constantly asking me how I can afford the things I wear. ,femalefashionadvice,d0cftkh,27,t5_2s8o5

A rainy day a moments reprieve in the insatiable summer. These pants confuse me because they fit my body.. but arent high waisted? I dont even know how that happens.

6784217,0,t3_48mr39,This is a more general version of a SQ post I made since that post got me thinking about this topic.What would you consider the guidelines of dressing for interviews for servingbartending positions? Obviously it varies somewhat by the type of barrestaurant  with fine dining I would dress up more than for fastcasual or a sports bar. Im specifically asking because I have an interview for serving tomorrow but Im also curious what others consider acceptablepreferable for this type of interview since I dont see it discussed as much as interviews for clothing retailers or professional environments.Heres what I would consider my very general guidelines Nothing sexy unless the job explicitly involves some kind of sex appeal e.g. shot girl waitress at Hooters. No blatant cleavage nothing super short or that shows stomach or a lot of shoulder. No jeans except for the most casual restaurants the kind where the uniformdress code includes jeans. In those cases jeans should be clean well fitting and not distressed. No teeshirts even if the uniformdress code involves tee shirts. Avoid clothing that would be very impractical or unsafe for the job. So no janglydangly jewelry no high heels no sandals nothing that restricts movement too much. I think this shows that you understand the physical demands of the job. Similar makeupbeauty guidelines to any other interview  nothing clubby or flashy or super trendy. For nicer restaurants some makeup would be preferable to no makeup but again excluding shot girlHooters type jobs I dont think makeup is strictly necessary.,femalefashionadvice,d0l9zix,3,t5_2s8o5

6804636,0,t3_48xjsx,I like clothes. At some challenging points at various jobs what I most looked forward to that day at work was wearing a professional cute and distinctive outfit that day. What I do hate is when something doesnt fit quite right because Ive lost weight or Im bloated or a cardigan is unexpectedly required but it doesnt work with that outfit or its unexpectedly nice and Im sweating or something requires ironing or Im wearing something that just doesnt work and feel off as a result. I am also not a fan of styling my hair and applying minimal makeup for work even though neither takes very long. I also hate when appropriate attire is a real crapshoot especially interview attire  I thrifted a perfectly fitting J Crew wool suit but there have been times where I was interviewed by a person wearing jeans or even leggings on more than one occasion! Even if wearing a suit was the right choice and made me look professional instead of insecure it always threw me off a little when I was ridiculously overdressed compared to my interviewer especially when being underdressed is considered a cardinal sin. ,femalefashionadvice,d0nllpv,6,t5_2s8o5

So I tried a mens small which matches my chest measurements in a few brands. They do fittheyre even comfortable to move inbut they make me look like like Ive gained about lbs. Its not that they obscure my shape so much as create a new one that I like lessthe ones I tried are too stiff to flow when really they mostly fit me at the bust and hips. So I own a mens sweater but its an XL so it is super oversized and drapes nicely.

6879497,0,t3_49zdtc,So a few nights ago my boyfriend decided he wanted to take me out on a date and made reservations at this restaurant weve been wanting to try. We got semidressed up for it and he was wearing his new wide brimmed hat lol.Anyway we go downtown and start noticing things are quite busy and people are wearing their hockey jerseys. NOOOOO. Neither of us really keep up with hockey and we didnt realize there was a game that night. Our downtown becomes crazy busy whenever theres a hockey game but we manage to find a parking spot.We go to the restaurant and realize its RIGHT IN FRONT of the arena. It was so crazy loud that the waitress had to yell to speak to us. We sat down anyway and look at the menu. Its a special game day menu! And the only vegetarian option is brussel sprouts. Im not vegetarian but my boyfriend is and hes not some huge fan of brussel sprouts. Trying to be positive he yells Ill just get the brussel sprouts! with a smile. NO. We like to order a lot of things and share when we go out. That combined with the loudness made me decide we should definitely leave and just go to one of our favourite restaurants instead.So the waitress came back and I said Im really sorry but I think we have to leave because we expected the menu that was online and we didnt know it was a game day...And theres only one vegetarian option! So we leave. And shortly after we realize how much like uppity hipsters we must look like leaving because we dont pay attention to hockey and we need vegetarian options. AND HE WAS WEARING A WIDE BRIMMED HIPSTER HAT. I dont think we can return. ,femalefashionadvice,d0w3t6j,37,t5_2s8o5

I comment on here from time to time but I dont announce my age or anything I had kind of always assumed that there were others among the active users but now Im wondering if thats true?Edit ah I refreshed the page and youve somewhat answered my question about what kind of issues you think would be relevant. While I totally agree that women over  though Im barely in that bracket have different life circumstances than women in their early s Im not sure that the actual fashion is so categorically different. Like the attitude you have toward shopping and what you can afford and how far you plan ahead is different but the actual aesthetics of clothes can be independent of that I think. I for one would rather hear from people of all ages who share my sense of style than to only hear from women in my age bracket who may have very different taste. If people want posts targeted toward different ages then go for it but I would be unlikely to participate for the above reasons.,femalefashionadvice,d1474gx,24,t5_2s8o5

7223615,0,t1_d1z0t6m,I have to disagree with the other commenters about the jeans they arent a great fit and I dont think you should wear them to your interview. I really like the first pair of jeans and the pencil skirt. I work in tech and have worn both nice jeans and black pants to interviews as well as dresses. I really like the blue top and if you are going for a casual vibe Id go with the first outfit you posted with the pointy black flats. Roundedtoe flats can make you look juvenile if you arent careful with how youre wearing them. I dont think the pencil skirt is too dressy I usually dress nicer for an interview than the dress code of the staff but then again I was consistently one of the more professionally dressed people at my company. I just preferred to wear outfits that were welltailored and more puttogether. There were a lot of guys I worked with who wore basketball shorts and tee shirts and sneakers every day while I was wearing pencil skirts and flowy buttondown shirts. Id go with something that looks polished thats a good reflection of who you are.

7283404,0,t3_4f4zsr,I really like a ton of the things Hank does but ugh...this song.gt well jeans are pretty great theyre durable and comfortable  theyre pants made out of plantsso its hard to argue theyre unethicalNo Hank. Its actually really easy to argue that many of the mass produced jeans made today are unethical. It takes plenty of water to produce cotton and the pesticides used in growing it havent exactly been kind to people in India. Adding in the people constructing the jeans it isnt hard to argue it at all.   gtbut if you really wanna know what I love   most about this wardrobe  is that it tells you very little  about what lies beneath these clothesBullshit. Hanks clothes definitely tell you about him. Beyond the images on his shirts they are a reflection of his lifestyle and his peer group. Dude obviously isnt in corporate finance nor is he doing hard labor all day hell the fact he CAN spend every day in a tshirt and jeans speaks volumes. He isnt the only white American nerd wearing jeans and graphic shirts.gtwell I think its odd how when we rebel  we put on uniforms  like eyeliner or fancy pants  that come factory pretorn  its easy to say  that a guy must be a certain wayjust because he dresses offbeat  and a subcultural shortcutmight be what hes going for but  its always gonna be incomplete  yeah were never really ever gonna know  what that means  which is why I wear tshirt and jeansIgnoring the stupid poser comments if hes trying to say that any message conveyed with fashion is incomplete then why does it matter that he wears a tshirt and jeans? As long as we can all acknowledge that someones personality doesnt start and stop with their clothes why does it matter if Hank wears a tshirt and jeans or a fishnet top and leather leggings? As mentioned earlier I disagree that the tshirt and jeans clear Hanks fashion from sending any nonverbal messages about him. Overall Hank is still cool in my book but it would be nice if he didnt assume that his outfit is some blank wall forcing you to talk to him to know more. ,femalefashionadvice,d262p4b,42,t5_2s8o5

7337197,0,t3_4fuipe,If the reason you want to see bigger models is because of wanting to see the clothes on someone closer to your size in my experience I havent seen a real benefit from size diversity when shopping online. The clothes are almost always pinned and made to fit the models perfectly in ways that they will never fit in real life. That said you are going to severely limit your options if you base your shopping habits on value judgments you make about models bodies. IMO the average person will not find the models on the sites you linked unhealthy and if you do its possible youre just not exposed to a lot of different bodies in your every day life and that is coloring your opinion. If it bothers you enough to avoid a retailer you might just prefer shopping in person. I recommend looking for local boutiques that you can call up to discuss how they source their items.,femalefashionadvice,d2c6t7m,14,t5_2s8o5

7398999,0,t3_4gku9q,OK this is going to be a provocative opinion but I think big wallets are anachronistic. They hail from a time when people were writing checks at the grocery store and carrying a ton of various cards. The phone has taken the place of cards to a large extent with apps like Apple Wallet and Android Pay storing loyalty cards gift cards and even credit cards. So it seems redundant to me to carry both a phone and a big wallet. If you must carry a big wallet the Pearl fills up quickly I had a Pearl but sold itnot for that reason but having owned one I have a good sense of what it fits. There are so many crossbody options out there if you need something a bit bigger. I also feel that an XL Pearl in napa wouldnt look right unless you had a tablet in each zipper compartment to give the bag structurethe reason I sold my napa Pearl was that the leather was too pliable for the structured silhouette of the bag and it looked bad when its shape got distorted as opposed to a shape like a hobo thats meant to be slouchy.

7492418,0,t3_4hzw8z,From the UK so I cant comment entirely on fashion of Europe as a whole but a bit may have to do with variations in weather in being less severe in extremes. Although global warming and the example of the last couple of years could be changing this Where I live I dont have a summer or winter wardrobe per say I just have more waterproof boots a thicker coat and a thermal layer and alternatively sandals although who am I kidding I mean lighter boots really and a cardigan instead of a coat. So the decrease in scope of wardrobe allows me to buy things to fit that one wardrobe. It may not have much of a bearing but it does make a difference to me in the fact i dont have seasonal wardrobes because the temp never really leaves between  to  degrees Celsius unlike say in Chicago where its like  to  degrees throughout the year.,femalefashionadvice,d2tuijn,3,t5_2s8o5

7594180,0,t3_4jbgq0,Ok so first things first  and  lbs is NOT  lbs overweight. It might be  lbs heavier than where you were at one point in your life but that does not mean you are overweight. Womens bodies shift throughout their lives and there are a range of healthy weights for every height and body type out there! I guarantee that at least  other FFAers are your height and within  lbs abovebelow your weight and youd never look at them and think She is  lbs overweight! I say this because we are SO critical of ourselves but we rarely look at other women with the same standard. That aside I am super unhappy with aspects of my body at times. For you maybe its doing a bit of strength training so you build more muscle or core strength in the areas that feel like problem areas to you?  months out from having a child is still in a window of adjusting your body back to where it will settle. I suggest just putting  minutes each day into doing simple toning things you can do at home with a newborn and maybe a little bit of walking. That ALONE will probably even your body back to where it was prebaby Ok now clothes I see from your link that youre attracted to a sort of easy downtoearth trendy vibe. The pics on the front page show a lot of loose dresses in an interesting color or fabric with a casual jacket thrown over and ankle boots. I also see skinny jeans and heels with a drapey tunic top. These are perfect looks for your shape and body concerns!The dresses I see are totally work appropriate at a job with your dress code as long as your arms are covered. Look for a dress with a drapey style or straighter fit and pair a jean jacket if your work allows it or a knit blazer or cardigan over it. Ankle boots look great on most people and make dresses look more urban to me and less sweet.As for your jeansbutt crack adjustment problemI feel you! My tummy is not an area I prefer to accentuate in jeans outfits. Love the look on other women hate it on me! I recommend looking for a fantastic pair of SUPER stretchy skinny jeans or pants. Does betabrand ship to Canada? If so I have these ponte skinny pants and I wear them to work ALL. THE. TIME. I love them. I like to get a tunicy silk tank or top and maybe a blazer. As for the top issue you mention I think tops that reach at or just below the waistband of your pants are the problem. Sometimes tops just ride up! I like tunic type tops. Do you have nordstrom or nordstrom rack? I have gotten a zillion awesome tunics at nordstrom rack for super cheap Everything looks good with heels so dont worry about having looser tops for now until you settle back into your postbaby body! If you still want fitted tops look for something with a thicker fabric that will sit right and not show every lump and bump we women get from where our pants sit!I dont know how much advice is too much so Im going to rein myself in now! I guess my best recommendation overall is find a silhouette or two that are your uniform for work. Maybe a looser dress with a fitted jacket or skinny pants and heels with a tunic top and blazer. Just focus on a few things that feel good and dont feel like you have to buy a ton of clothes at once! ,femalefashionadvice,d35f4pl,10,t5_2s8o5

7615892,0,t1_d37i2zc,Because of the danger of excess.  A stores goal is to not have an endless amount of something to sellthey have a target to sell through.  So it makes more sense to produce  mediums knowing you will sell all  than to produce  mediums thinking that maybe you will only be able to sell .  Take that extra  you didnt sell and multiply it for the entire line then the entire inventory across all stores and you are looking at a loss of millions of dollars per quarter.  For instance I have worked for companies where they thought hey this stuff sold out so well last year so this year lets double or triple the units we are going to produce because maybe we will be able to do double or triple the sales!  One company lost  million dollars in a single quarter from that mistake.Basically yes it is annoying but big companies are not looking at the individual units in the same way an average shopper is.,femalefashionadvice,d37vy7q,14,t5_2s8o5

I also got a pair of jeans for closer to  from LOFT that are so baggy and gross after a few hours of wear that are ALSO the same cottonelastane blend. I have two pairs of joes jeans in different washesfabric content that are almost unrecognizable after less than an hour of wear one is cotton  elastane and one is cottonrayonelastane blend. And they were expensive! Theyre supposed to be premium denim not potato sack pants! My point is that in my experience price doesnt matter brand doesnt matter fabric content is hit and miss. But Ive learned my lesson and Im really not shy about returns. If a brand new pair of pants cant stand up to one measly day of wear the company will almost always take it back and refund you.  I actually have been so frustrated with this that Ill put on a new pair of pants and keep the tags on while I do chores in the house and if theyre baggy after a few hours they go right back to the store. ,femalefashionadvice,d49noy2,9,t5_2s8o5
7955597,0,t3_4o66r9,Actually I feel like the less Ive let my clothing be affected by the people around me the happier Ive been about what Im wearing. Im sure theres more going on there than just clothes though  Ive gotten a lot better about selfconfidence and not giving a fuck about other peoples opinions over the years. Or rather giving an appropriate number of fucks.Although over the past few years the color palettes in my wardrobe and my husbands have slowly converged to the point where we regularly end up in identicallycolored outfits in the morning last one to finish getting dressed has to change!. Soon I imagine well stop fighting it and just be that obnoxious couple in matching clothes...so clearly there is some influence happening! Maybe its just that Ive found the right people to be influenced by.,femalefashionadvice,d4aa88h,3,t5_2s8o5

7983471,0,t1_d4dewfv,thanks!! i love it too! and my main goal was to find something that could fit a food baby because omg the restaurant we are having it at has the most delicious food and i want to eat all of it. oh yeah. we have a month to go and i finally narrowed down what i want the day to be like. i think not having an idea of exactly how you want it to go is the best way because if something goes wrong then...whatever it goes wrong. the worst thing that can happen probably wont and no one will care if the flowers arent perfect or if it rains or whatever. the important parts are that your friends and family are there to celebrate you and your fiance. that is how i have been looking at it and i feel like we are both pretty chill about everything. ,femalefashionadvice,d4df1lh,1,t5_2s8o5

8107897,0,t1_d4rdg2a,Yeah its hard to know if they will get rid of the freedoms of movement but damn it made things so easy. I lived in the Netherlands and it was so easy compared to the American and Russians I was friends with. Having an EU passport in in general amazing. Very little issue with getting visas for countries that do require them too. It is so difficult to get good professional work in the EU if you are a nonEU resident. I know people who literally had interviews for professional jobs taken back off them when they found out they didnt have residency so it would be the responsibility of the company to sort it out. The EU is not perfect. Its practically killed off our local fishing industries in Ireland and there is a high level of bureaucracy. They were generally slow to recognise Irish as our native language also. Yeah we all speak English but that doesnt mean we shouldnt have representation of our native tongue. Politics is on local levels for a reason by local people having the country run at a high level from Belgium isnt ideal but it might be a necessary evil for the amount of benefit it brings. ,femalefashionadvice,d4ref9s,3,t5_2s8o5

8135555,0,t3_4qnz8i,So there are a bunch of different things happening here at once. The size number i.e.   on a pair of pants doesnt necessarily correspond to the size of the waist on the pants. Its supposedly meant to refer to the size of the waist of the person who wears the pants. Theres a lot of room for error here because not every person with the same size waist as in natural waist is going to fit into the same size of a pair of pants which hit at a point lower than the waist.. The size chart for a brand of clothing usually also refers to the measurements of the hypothetical person wearing the clothes not the garments themselves.. Size charts are also inaccurate for a lot of people. Partly because not everyone has the same proportions so the most sizecrucial measurement on a particular garment may be different from person to person.. And also vanity sizing.,femalefashionadvice,d4uidpx,16,t5_2s8o5

My thought process on rating wear was kind of On a scale of  if an occasion came up to wear this how likely would I be to pick it? Its definitely not an exact science but I tried to go with my gut on a rating. My newer shoes are definitely getting worn much more right now than my older ones. And I also didnt take season into account so my fall and winter shoes wear rating isnt affected by the fact that its summer right now and Im not wearing them at all.I like your idea of adding fit notes! This would be especially helpful to keep track of what shoes are preferable for long wearlots of walking because I may not always do lots of walking in certain pairs and it would be good to know whats going to make me miserable after a couple hoursmiles.,femalefashionadvice,d5c4e17,5,t5_2s8o5
8276843,0,t3_4ss9it,. Whats worthwhile spending money on depends a lot on your lifestyle. Spending money on quality special occasion wear might not be worth it if you only wear that dress to weddings twice a year or that expensive suit to interviews every five years. They probably wont wear out regardless of the inferior quality.. When people recommend spending money on quality basics its also a good idea to have some common sense. A  basic blazer might be worth it if you work in finance because you can wear it for years to come and people will be able to tell it apart from a  blazer from HampM. However a  tshirt will still get deodorant stains just as fast as a  one from HampM and itll look roughly the same.. I also hate the term investment clothes because its not actually an investment when its money you just spent and wont see again. Spending and investing are two very different things. With this in mind I personally prefer spending money on workwear since thats the only area in which you might potentially get an actual return on your investment. If an expensive suit will make you look more competent and contribute towards a promotion then thats money well spent.,femalefashionadvice,d5c5wwi,9,t5_2s8o5

8280105,0,t1_d5cjm68,I got you and this is exactly the type of advice I wanted! Going through my wardrobe I feel like a lot of my pieces were exactly what you said young. Especially as I was looking through them I was like how do I even wear some of this to work? which I feel is a kind of a drawback to this project. Certain separates definitely can read a lot different especially when wearing short yoga shorts haha depending on what theyre paired with. For example this is more of what Id wear to work. I feel like a cool  year old professional in that. Its weird seeing my previous WAYWTs which definitely showcase a lot more professional than this I think and trying to match those pieces to the pieces I photographed in my visual wardrobe. My job also doesnt help the matter because it is a unique position where normal business casual rules dont apply. I would be so overdressed in even a pair of slacks. But youre right I would never wear a crop top or tiny shorts to work.

The soles are absolutely useless on icy sidewalks which means I cant wear them from NovemberMay theyre too warm to wear anytime between MaySeptember and being real leather probably shouldnt be worn in the rain though I do it anyways.

Theres a reason pretty much everyone I know wears only slipon shoes...Seriously buying docs was a terrible decision. Ive worn them like four times in the past few years.The best shoes have been my TUK creeper sneakers. Theyre nice enough that I got away with wearing them to work at an office job comfortable enough that theyre pretty much the only shoes in the world that dont hurt my feet after a long day of walking warm enough to wear when its  outside and I have to go on an hourlong walk and of course theyre slipons.

The meat was obviously eaten. Im generally ok with any animal products in clothing as long as the animal was treated well or wild and not endangeredthreatened killed humanely and as much of the animal was used as possible.

I am very conscious about my consumption  reduce then reuse then recycle  so thrifting helps me limit my own negative impact.Wearing thrifted J.

Im a lot happier  The first few weeks of a class or job Ill get constant comments mostly complimentary though some are that sort of snarky question thing that girls do sometimes then after a while people get used to the way I dress and the comments lessen a bit.

8540832,0,t1_d691pcf,Yes for sure! I think the comments are rarely malicious although Im sure that happens too if its a competitive workplace and more about  seeing a change in someone coworkers see on a daily basis  seeing someone stand out from the rest of the group. Being very dressed down rarely invited comments though.One guy on my team always wore dress shirts either OCBD or nice plaid long sleeved button downs with the sleeves rolled up slacks or chinos and nice oxfords instead of this kind of shoe He would look incredibly dressed down in any formal environment but was far more dressed up than the rest of the team. Even when he did this everyday his outfits inspired more frequent random comments from coworkers than my dresses ever did especially if he wore a particularly brighter shirt new shirt or a cardiganblazer instead of a hoodie when it was cold.I just mentioned the gender ratio and engineering company for context for the OP.

8552648,0,t3_4wtw32,I have similar proportions to you Im a bit shorter and a bit larger  but I share the large hips when compared to my waist. I used to really really hate shopping and my wardrobe going into college was pretty abysmal all jeans and unisex tee shirts. So your questions Sheer shirts are very popular recently what you wear with them really depends on your comfort level. I wear a cotton cami with pretty much everything because I hate people seeing my bra. You can wear bralettes which come in interesting shapes and are designed to be seen and make it a feature of the outfit. Or you can say idgaf and wear whatever bra you want though I suspect you may want to invest in camis from your post.  I shop mostly at thrift stores Kohls Macys Target TJ Maxx or Nordstoms Rack. Theyre all pretty reasonably priced you just need to step outside the Juniors department. Which really is the biggest tip. If you want to look more mature and wear less clothing with slogans or glitter or whatever you do need to step into the Misses or Womens departments. I will say there are some gems in the Juniors but you have to really search for them and not get discouraged easily. I personally like thrift stores because my style is heavily vintage and most modern fast fashion doesnt appeal to me. However thrift stores require a huge amount of searching and they often arent organized well which may frustrate you. Pencil skirts are awful. I hate them. I hate body con dresses too. Most of my wardrobe is skirts  I find the most flattering for me are circle skirts or lightly pleated skirts. I wear both mini skirts the skater skirt shape is nice or longer midi skirts because I like looking like I belong in a s movie. I like them because they gloss right over my hips and skim out any weird bulges and I wear them at my natural waist so they highlight the tiniest part of my body. Other random tips  mid to higher rise pants are much more flattering and comfortable to me. Theyre also in style unlike when I was going into college. I have never found skinny jeans very flattering on me I prefer a straighter leg. However youll probably have to try on a variety of pant silhouettes and figure out which flatter you best. My current favorite jeans and the one pair I own are Levis Mid Rise Skinny which arent actually very skinny. Look for any curvy cuts and dont be afraid to try on a bunch. It also sounds like youre struggling to figure out your style and thats fine. Totally normal too. High school can be super insulating and its very easy to wear basic things that everyone else is wearing. But college can be a great place to develop your style. You can see how other people dress and decide if you want to emulate that. Maybe spend some time on Pinterest or in the WAYWT threads on this sub to see what you like and what you dont. Its very hard to shop without a defined style because its hard to figure out how different pieces will work with your wardrobe. Try to keep an open mind and try everything on. Not everything is going to work and thats fine. But you will find things you like that flatter you you just need to keep at it and keep a positive attitude.Also you can really wear anything in college. I started my freshman year six years ago and the sheer variety of styles was almost overwhelming. Everything from jeans and college tee shirts to full on suits. And even pjs occasionally. ,femalefashionadvice,d6ankj8,4,t5_2s8o5

8567731,0,t3_4x3uix,Ah yes so youve been introduced to the mommy wars early I see. So some things about your style are just going to change out of convenience  jewelry no dangling ear rings or necklaces for awhile! the fabrics you wear if you breastfeed youll eye everything keeping in mind if you can whip a boob out while wearing it ... the first year was rough for me in terms of style because your body DOES shift when youre pregnant and then its going to take time to shift back. Very very very few people walk out of the hospital looking stylish and put together. But as you slide into your mom role youll figure out your style. It may change it may not. But honestly from this point forward some mom is going to have an opinion about how you do EVERYTHING. This is just the tip of the iceberg. And if this is how shes approaching it now it sounds like your SIL is going to be a real peach during pregnancy  and when the baby comes. Good luck with that.

Im pretty familiar with their offerings and sometimes Ill see something on clearance that I never saw for sale fullprice. So I try to stick to things I know are from their regular line when shopping their sales. I feel that the price is justified because of their labor practices not necessarily the quality every time.

8835466,0,t3_515obv,I used to work at American Eagle. I always felt weird about selling clothes that I could never afford without my employee discount while little preteens regularly bought  worth of clothes on their parents credit cards. I actually had a lot of mixed feelings about working there because while I love fashion and style and even some of the stuff we sold I hated the pressure to push customers to buy so we could meet the stores sale goal of the day. I liked helping customers find an item they needed and looked and felt good in. But the majority of the time it was push push push to make a sale. I understand that it was a business and we were there to make money but as someone who had always been tight with money being told to add an extra item to a customers purchase so we could meet a goal didnt feel right. But working there totally converted me when it comes to their jeans and Soft And Sexy shirts. Those jeans are sooo comfy  pretty good quality and Soft And Sexy tees may not be sexy its usually a friggin drapy tshirt come on but damn are they soft.

For most people updating a wardrobe is a really long process. Finding clothes that fit look good are in your pricerange and are in your style is fairly difficult regardless of bodytype. I consider a  success rate in a fitting room to be pretty kickass and when I started that was more like . If done slowly and thoughtfully I think youll find that you naturally evolve. Some people might notice a shirt or a pair of pants though unless you are close friends they are probably unlikely to care.

I dont think any domestic help should be shameful for the employer or the worker. Ive been both. It takes a lot to keep a household running at maintenance and even more if you want to work your way up to something else. Im thinking of Agatha Christies biography where her middleclass household like most others had at least a cook and one servant in addition to a mothersisterwife doing the work of managing the house. Then again Im not sure my household would have been middle class in that day. My extended family certainly wouldnt.But wages are pretty stagnant  I have to be careful about what I get tailored because our household is on a tight budget.

8995664,0,t1_d7t4s9f,I didnt write this all at once.  I was thinking about it over the course of this morning and just kept making edits as more points came to mind.  Being a grad student making things last and getting semidecent quality cheap is the only way I function.For sweaters I just lay them flat on a random surface somewhere.  I dont have a lot of space anywhere. If I only have one sweater to dry I just put it on the top of the dryer and I dont own any sweaters that are very thick so it generally dries all the way through in a day.  If I have several sweaters I just put a towel over the carpet and dry them on the floor in a corner of my bedroom somewhere.  I probably get away with doing this just because I live in Florida so my stuff is thinner and not super nice and I dont need it very frequently.  I might not recommend this if you are trying to dry cashmere or wool or something but those fabrics are out of my budget and not super necessarily for the climate I live in.,femalefashionadvice,d7t5139,4,t5_2s8o5
8997241,0,t1_d7t7oh7,I mean sure that works sometimes but again the option to thrift or go to consignment stores and actually find good things is highly location dependent and it takes a lot of time. Generally the good stuff is only found in thrift places near wealthier populations that are fairly homogenous.  I know they exist because I know people who have been successful but in my local midsized and INCREDIBLY socioeconomically diverse city you dont see a lot of areas where wealthy people are highly concentrated so anything good is gone immediately and most of what is left is very worn out and dated stuff that was fast fashion quality at best when brand new and is now in really horrible shape after being worn and discarded by someone else.  Id rather have fast fashion new before its pilled and dingy if thats all thats available locally.Plus thrifting takes a lot of time because the stores locally by me look like a hurricane went through and the  of items that arent complete crap are gone so fast that you have to go browse through mountains of crap frequently.  I dont have that kind of time or patience when  of the time its just a disheartening experience. I would thrift all the time if I had stores like the ones I hear about from people who live near areas where there is a concentrated population of relatively homogenous upperupper middle class people but that doesnt exist within a  hour radius of where I live.,femalefashionadvice,d7tbupt,17,t5_2s8o5

While just about anyone can look good in some colors of course white for example there are certain colors that really clash or enhance different tones yelloworange and green for instance. I can definitely see that it is quite difficult to find flattering colors if you have a more rare skin tone in the US  e.g. saturated deep yellows look great on midtoned south Asians but are really hard to find.I realize youre more talking about the politics of exclusion I just thought this was an interesting tangent.,femalefashionadvice,d7v7i77,11,t5_2s8o5

9087829,0,t1_d845cxj,Hey fellow New Englander! I used to work at a ski shop selling jackets so this is right in my wheelhouse. Honestly they look very similar to me and Ive owned awesome jackets from both brands. I personally find Patagonia to be a more expensive brand overall. The biggest differences I can find between the two jackets you linked The LL Bean jacket has fill down while the Patagonia has fill. The fill power is a measure of fluffiness of the down  how much air it can trap to form a barrier between the warm your body and the cold outside. Down with a higher fill power is fluffier so it can trap more air and therefore be more insulating in smaller amounts. If you had g of both downs the fill would be warmer. Unfortunately I cant find the weight of the LL Bean jacket so I cant say which one might be warmer but I think theyre similar enough that you wont notice too much of a difference in warmth. the Patagonia jacket is listed as being water resistant while the Bean one isnt. Thats definitely a factor that could drive up the price.If water resistance is a big selling point for you the Patagonia might be the way to go but if not youd probably be just as warm in the Bean jacket!,femalefashionadvice,d847l1s,11,t5_2s8o5

This didnt seem to help so I did some googling and came across this Smelly Hair Syndrome which is apparently caused by a fungus?! Once my hair was dry it smelled fine but it certainly freaked me out enough for me to go to Ulta and get Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo.,femalefashionadvice,d849c4u,10,t5_2s8o5

I take it off maybe xmonth to clean the lotion out of it but other than that it stays on. I had it made in the spring so its a touch tight in the summer and a touch big in the winter. Its annoying but not too bad.My engagement ring on the other hand drives me CRAZY. I gave my thenBF not husband my ring size when he went shopping and the jeweler accidentally made it  size too small. Since we got engaged right after Thanksgiving it was cold and it fit perfectly  I didnt notice until we went to get my wedding band made and the jeweler sized it. Now in the summer its so tight that it leaves a red mark above my knuckle when I put it on. Im considering having it made to the right size but I dont want it to spin TOO much and I also dont want to part with it for a week lol.

Ive been buying vintage sweater lately and they are so incredibly different even when its similar in some other way. A cropped sweater now is not the same as a cropped sweater from the s the bottom is tighter the ribbing wider the fit overall tighter. now a cropped sweater is loose overall the shoulders slope more the fit on the bust is looser. Aside from all that keeping a sweater for life is just not possible in terms of care and durability. Knitwear degrades it pills colors fade it becomes thin etc. You can keep it for a couple of decades sure but it wont be long that it wont look quite as good. and at that point why not buy a new sweater?,femalefashionadvice,d8m5na2,5,t5_2s8o5

9252664,0,t3_570aml,gt The whole point is to put the meaning of a diamond in perspective. People spend a lot of money on completely disposable things  changing phones every year spending a lot of money on tattoos for that matter. We live in a world where everything is ephemeral everything is disposable and completely dematerialized.I think this quote is implying that in the s DeBeers marketing pitch was that the diamond is something permanent something that wont lose its value something you can depend on and thats the concept that sold with the public. Now that public interests have changed theyre trying to rebrand the stone into a kind of disposable purchase that shows off how rich you are just based on the fact that you can waste insane amounts of money on something completely superfluous. Millennials is kind of a stupid target market so I think the guy is saying that he is marketing specifically to that slice of millennials who buy a new phone every year and I think in that respect his idea is good. Of course this population does not intersect with the population that has the  trillion in student loans but its not like he could say outright that they dont care about the poors in a publicity interview. ,femalefashionadvice,d8oubnf,7,t5_2s8o5

Quality amp drape of the oversized item. How does it frame your body? Does it just overwhelm your figure or does it drape against it a little?

Its fun to browse to the bottom of the board sometimes and see how my style and fashion interests have evolved over the seasons!Blonde Pixie Cut is a board for my hair where Ive gathered a bunch of pictures similar to my hairstyle and hair type. I always take it to my hairdresser when I go for a cut although at this point she probably already knows how I like my hair cut. If I ever wanted to change things up a little though I would use the board to get my ideas across. Whenever I try to describe a haircut in words it goes terribly wrong.The third and last functional board is my Wishlist. Ive got a bunch of things pinned there and I pick one to save for... Once I have it I delete it off the board.

Again I lived this.gtAlso loose skirts are less form fitting than jeans or pants most of the time.But not always more modest which was as much the point of the garments as distinction between the sexes. I have seen well up the legs of a lot of women I know because as soon as they sit down the skirt that was midshin is now riding up and revealing their thighs. My MIL is always flashing her undies without realizing it because her nice loose skirts dont do much when she sits down with her legs uncrossed.      gtI dont like to bring up religion here often but it really bothers me when anyone of faith becomes them and they all believe the same thing.I wasnt saying that people all believe the same thing. Im still a Christian. I still go to church and stuff. My use of they was simply a result of no longer belonging to the same group I grew up in and no longer adhering to their modesty doctrines.

This and bacteria are common sources of foot odor cause by overusefrequent sweating or not letting them dry after being wet.  It isnt uncommon. I recommend rubbing them down with alcohol and then spraying with athletes foot spray. This should get it if it is bacterial or fungal. Part of the problem is sometimes it can begin to grow underneath the insole in the midsole especially if left untreated for a long time. There arent a lot of good ways to clean that.

9828503,0,t3_5fyf6f,I recently bought a leather jacket in two sizes to see which I like better. The smaller one looks better on me imo but a little snug in the armpits.

Skinny pants just make me look like a lollipop. Im very much an aline skirt girl.I like HampM basics. I find their cotton long sleeved ts are very good quality and last a looong time. The ones I currently wear right now are at least  years old. As others have said uniqlo is great but I found that I have to touch the fabrics because Ive bought somethings that looked good on the website but in person were disappointing same with HampM Old Navy or any discount brand. Ive also got some good inexpensive basics from Old Navy Marks Work Warehouse and Sears.

10016745,0,t3_5j2r97,I have had several really good buying experiences on Poshmark. Just be cautious about buying things without enough info  for example ask for specific details on the wear and tear of the item if that isnt made clear from the listing and ask for clearer photos if they arent great. Generally speaking sellers have always been very friendly and upfront about things.

Jeggings stretchy silky pants cuffed skinny jeans or a slim dress loose top open flannel batwing sweater boxy jacket or big long warm cardigan. If I wear a slim top the shoes become more of a statement and you can play off the colors by incorporating complementary or contrasting elements.

10054302,0,t3_5jn7ib,Oh I was so ready for this post and I didnt even know it. Im in grad school and Im currently doing an internship which has taught me a few things about my future wardrobe and I should put this knowledge into words. So thank you OP this came at the right time for me. More basic shirts. They get worn out and need replacement. Good. I know what I like and what I need. I just need to actually find the pieces and buy them. This happens all the time so I know what to do and where Ill be most likely to find them. A few little jackets. Not for actual outerwear but more like blazers and boucl jackets. This is also pretty safe I know what I like and I know that Ill wear them until they fall apart. I purged a lot of jackets some years ago and it hasnt been a problem until now. The place Im interning at has taught me that I need more layers for places that are sometimes hot sometimes cold or for when I dont know how warm the place Im going to is. The downside this is an expensive category of clothing and I really dont have a lot of money. However Im not in a hurry. I can make do with what I have for a while if I update my base layers. a couple of dresses. Id like one for everyday wear and one for parties. Again due to wardrobe purging a couple of years ago. I see a lot of dresses that I like but I have a hard time finding ones I like that are also the right lenght. Also its a category of clothes I usually dont prioritize when shopping but find myself missing a lot when Im at home planning what to wear the next day. a pair of nice shoes. Cool flats or ones with a low heel. I hate shoe shopping so Ill probably just not do this but I could really use a good pair of slightly dressier shoes.  A medium sized bag. Those are expensive so I wont buy one in  but I can still make it a resolution to look for one. I have a small bag that Im completely happy with and a workschool one thats ok but doesnt need to be replaced until Ive found a real job and know what I need. But a medium sized bag is something I find myself missing a lot so I want to look for one that I really like and maybe if some strange deity of personal finance is nice to me start saving up for one. A nice comfortable nude bra. This is actually at the top of my list. A pain to shop for and expensive too. Yay.,femalefashionadvice,dbi3m5o,2,t5_2s8o5

10252431,0,t1_dc63ih6,Ive been doing that all afternoon as I did yet another closet purge.  Some of my stuff makes me happy but its just not me right now.  I always wore cross body bags.  I used to get cheap ones from Target and HampM until I upgraded to some nice leather Fossil ones about  years ago.  In September I saw the Fossil Dawson Satchel on clearance and decided to treat myself.  Its been my goto purse ever since.  Im no longer wearing crossbody bags but I know I could be again in the future.  Theyre amazing bags  just not me right now.  They dont exactly spark joy only because I have something shinier and newer but they dont make me unhappy either.     Contrast that with my closet purge.  I was able to get rid of about  formal dresses today even though they were classic styles from brand names.  I realised that after several moves they were just taking up space in my closet and Ill never wear them again.  There are a few dresses that I questioned and decided to keep but I feel good about my choices.,femalefashionadvice,dc663sl,3,t5_2s8o5

10255019,0,t3_5muguk,I seriously hope malls will continue to exist. At least  of my shopping is done in malls because I can immediately discern the quality of clothing how thinthick it is and how it will fit on me. And if something doesnt fit in one store I can just move onto another store in that general vicinity and look for a similar style. Personally Id loathe having to shop predominantly or entirely online or move from store to store over a much larger distance. The way I see the mall versus online thing... You can go to a mall and tell right away which clothes fit hop over to a neighboring store if the need be and get the clothes immediately. Or you can go online and find  different similar pieces likely from different stores have them all delivered to see which one you like best  is the best quality then have to deal with returning the nogos if you even can. I feel like online shopping would be okay if I wasnt so stringent about the quality of my clothes but I am and I dont have time to return all the shit that doesnt work so thats that.Edit Fixed grammar and overall coherence.

What I am going to say that mass incarceration is such a systemic problem that we have entire holding facilities where the inmates are lucky to get a  step meeting brought in to them or a church service or anything that would break the fucking monotony of being warehoused. yes you read that right. warehoused.entire facilities do nothing but warehouse prisoners with no opportunity to do a damn thing but sit there and watch paint flake off the walls. Entire holding facilities exist that barely offer GED classes and a few trustee positions doing laundry and doing all the kitchen stuff in a facility with hundreds of inmates thats only a few jobs and a whole lot of watching paint flake.There are a lot of inmates who would absolutely LOVE to have something anything to do and these counties parishes and corporations are too concerned with making a profit to actually invest in anything that might help inmates become rehabilitated. Having inmates do jobs requires far more supervisory guards than simply sticking  inmates in one giant dorm where  guards can sit in a control room that supervises that dorm and at least one other.And dont get me started on healthcare or the lack thereof. Mental healthcare? bahahahahahaha yeah right.Learn what the prison system is really doing before you start making comments about the prison system.,femalefashionadvice,dct08ro,27,t5_2s8o5

Bring it up in a non accusatory way and then ask if there is anything he feels could be better bring up stuff you think could be better. End with sex as this is the second best thing for  a healthy relationship.Another way I deal with weird periods in my relationship is to take really good care of myself.

10686402,0,t3_5ssrv2,I always follow this rule if I cant think of  situations in the next month where I could wear it and  different ways to style it for every occasion I wont buy it.And it cant be vague such as I can wear this skirt with a black top to a bar with a cute blouse to work and a Tshirt and sneakers for a lazy Sunday! because I could still be delusional enough to interpret bar as a fancy rooftop bar in New York City instead of the Stockholm bars I actually go to. Or I could think of lazy Sunday as me spending the day chilling in botanical gardens and going to a jazz brunch when it really means doing what I usually do on Sunday afternoons go to the grocery store and the pharmacy  do laundry visit my mom and MAYBE go to a museum.So it has to be I can wear this skirt to bar X with top amp to work with top amp and when I run errands on Sundays with top amp. I hang clothes I have not worn in  months in a special section of my closet. Only  out of these  tops can come from than category.Since I have WAY more tops than bottoms it has to be  different tops. So the tops I can wear with the skirt to a bar cant overlap with the the other occasions.If it would have been a top instead of a skirt I would have to find at least  different bottoms I could pair it with.This rule is kinda difficult to explain but its the only thing thats helped me!!!,femalefashionadvice,ddi80ji,1,t5_2s8o5

It makes an allblack outfit more interesting. Vary your textures. A black silk blouse with a black leather skirt looks interesting. Even better if the silk is kind of sheer to balance feminine with tough.

10854786,0,t3_5v4oua,I have been obsessed with a long utility jacket from F since December and it is very very on sale right now. The problem with jackets is that none of them ever fit my hips which is ok with like denim jackets or moto jackets or whatever because when they fit my shoulder but cant be done up it isnt a big deal but I feel like with long jackets that doesnt really fly.BUT I WANT IT.Do I have to wait until I find a utility jacket designed specifically for enormous hips before I can have one? As an additional question are there ways to tailor an item to fit enormous hips when it fits in the shoulders? I run into this problem with blouses  tops made from woven fabric frequently too.,femalefashionadvice,ddzleme,7,t5_2s8o5
10855497,0,t3_5uv3ge,I dont have a set lifecycle but I try to make things last as long as possible for example by fixing holesstains etc washing as little as possible and avoiding the dryer for anything except bedding towels and underwear. Still my oldest piece of clothing is a cardigan which is only about andahalf years old and that is probably the longest Ive kept something and it still be in wearable condition. Its not my style anymore though so I only use it inside the house as an extra layer.I try to consume as little as possible and not resort to throwing or donating clothes but since Ive become more interested in fashion and experimenting with different styles Ive naturally started to go through more clothes. Things used to be years old and unwearable by the the time I was finished with them now though I get sick of things before they get to that point. Im aware this is a bad habit to be in so I try to cancel it out by buying second hand and never binning anything.I either donate old clothes to a local hospice charity shop so hopefully they dont end up getting shipped abroad and end up causing problems for people and economies there or if they arent wearable I cut them up to be used for cleaning rags or take them to HampM for recycling. None of these solutions are perfect though and I agree with the OP that getting rid of clothing by any method can feel wrong.So in short I guess I try to be more mindful of how I buy and dispose of clothes more than the length of time that I keep them for. I would never buy something with the intention of wearing it once or twice but if I buy something second hand and care for it properly then I dont feel so bad if it ends up in my donate pile or polishing my shoes a year later.  ,femalefashionadvice,ddzo1si,1,t5_2s8o5

10935168,0,t3_5w3zbn,I expect to live in my clothes and refuse to baby anything that isnt a gown or a very nice cocktail dress. The majority of my stuff is washed on gentle or regular cycle because I dont have time or energy to hand wash or take to the cleaners except for special pieces. The below list is based on such treatment. Heres my experience. Alexander Wang Dresses are durable. Tshirts are a flimsy no and sweaters are soso that unless you get on sale I wouldnt bother. Burberry Heritage coats are durable as are most of the runway line coats. I have pieces going on  years in near mint condition despite being worn reguarly. Dresses are a mixed bag  get on sale. Sweaters and shirts arent durable. Avoid the lowerrange coats and jackets their puffers are fine and will last. Lower priced wallets are terrible. Boots and flats are durable.  Theory Blazers are pretty durable. Dresses are a little less and coats are soso as are the sweaters and shirts. The costdurability is a little better if on sale. Rag amp Bone Pantsjeans arent durable. Construction didnt impress me at all. Not worth the price unless major major sale. Eileen Fisher Durable basics. Her silk tees I have used abused and tossed in the washer and they endure.Majestic Filatures I was a fan but now Ive had their stuff for a while...the turtlenecks and tees arent holding up. Not pilling but the color and richness of the fabric leave much to be desired. Ill stick to Eileen Fisher. Gucci I didnt go a year before I actually got a rip in a dress. Seriously?Alexander McQueen Dresses shirts and coats are durable. Havent bought any sweaters so cant say. If you are patientbuy usedwait for steep sales you can get great pieces at excellent deals.Michael Kors Collection I returned a cashmere sweater a coat and a dress all variously bought at  off. When its not worth keeping even at that price point thats all I have to say. I do have a silk shirt that I kept because the color is beautiful but its still not up to snuff. Michael Michael Kors I dont know but if the main line is poor... Yves Saint Laurent Durable durable durable. Yes its overpriced. But its beautiful well constructed and it lasts. I have new pieces vintage pieces and theyre all going strong. Blazers dresses jeans  stalk the sales or buy preloved. It will still be pricey but it is worth the investment. They last and last like my Burberry coats. J.Crew Avoid like the plague. Ann Taylor Blazers are okay. Shirts and sweaters last maybe a year or two. Would take over J.Crew HampM and the like. Valentino Dresses I dont wear regularly enough to know how durable they truly are but the craftmanship is so strong that I cant imagine they wont last. I certainly bought them expecting to get years and years. Even on sale these will be expensive but the quality difference is clear. Tops are sturdy but definitely only worth it on huge sale. Id rank their dresses and coats higher.  Red Valentino Im always tempted every year because the clothes and bags are so cute but the craftmanship is not worth the cost. Wait and save to buy big sister Valentino on sale. AGJoes They used to be durable. My jeans are  years old and still in perfect condition. As long as you stay away from the factory made ones and get  cotton with only elastane youll be good even today.Stella McCartney Dresses are okay. They last but the construction isnt as strong as it should be given the price point. Buy on major sale.Jason Wu Dresses shirts and sweaters are surprisingly durable and his stuff almost always goes on sale. Aquatalia I use and abuse their shoes and they endure.Express LOL. They can be friends with J.Crew. Asos Also friends with J.Crew and Express. Sandro Surprisingly durable.  Dior Not impressed with their shoes. Bags and leather goods are gorgeous.Ferragamo Scarves are crazy durable. Wallets are nice. Shoes can be used and abused theyll die eventually but youll get your moneys worth for sure.  Givenchy Dresses are above Gucci but below McQueen Saint Laurent and Valentino. Worth it on sale. Hollister My favorite for loungebum clothes. Treated like garbage but I still get a few years out of them anyway.  If you really want durable go vintage. I find this especially true with sweaters. ,femalefashionadvice,de7vwa7,36,t5_2s8o5

I was made to use the boys restroom a couple times. Small town conservatives have no time for different. I danced ballet and was often in my tights and Leo but zero girly body face and hair didnt help me socially in any way.

I do recognize th grade as the reason I dont care what you look like or what your genitals are if you need to pee use the next available toilet.

I had no friends and spent all day either sleeping in my gross messy room or hanging out with my shitty older boyfriend who was a complete creep and asshole looking back on it now. I remember being so proud of how skinny I was...And its funny because at the time I felt so ugly. And looking at old pictures I was probably the most attractive I have ever been.  I mean I sure as hell hope so considering the effort I put in my appearance. But at the time I felt so completely unlovable and hideous.These days I dont get cat called or hit on at all. I gained some weight and cut all my hair off in a pixie cut. I dress really conservatively dont wear makeup very often wear my glasses. But I feel prettier and happier than I ever did before. It is way more important for me to be seen as competent and respectable than to be seen as sexy or attractive. After being homeless for  years and trapped in a long string of abusive relationships Im just over trying to live my life appealing to other people.

A chain retail store will have many premade rings available to view this is true but because of their extra costs they are going to sell a ring of a given quality for a higher markup than a local jeweler will sell the same ring. I believe the thing to understand about fine jewelry such as an engagement ring is that it doesnt have to be bought like clothing off the rack and that buying off the rack so to speak is not actually cheaper.Tagging udiamonddealer uawakeasleep and umicarei for confirmation.

But my SO was just telling me that he thinks I first of all need to stop buying sneakers Im..kind of addicted and if Im going to buy shoes get flats. Its not something I ever thought about but flats do flatter skinny ankles in a way that sneakers dont.

11044522,0,t1_dejvbh1,gt When you take the hardships out of your life you start seeing it through rose tinted glasses.Yes totally. Although I think it doesnt end here. Its not about wishing your life was harder. Like I think we can all agree that if you really need something in your life its good to buy it if you can afford it. Right? Theres nothing immoral about fulfilling your needs. What about if you really WANT something? Is it wrong to get yourself something you really want if you can afford it? Theres probably nothing wrong with that either. But what if you think you want something and you can afford it and you get it for yourself and then you never used it. And now youre storing it somewhere and buying a bigger house or a storage unit or buying more furniture to store all the things you bought but never really used. It starts to feel a little gross. What does that contribute to the world? What does it contribute to my own life? To me minimalism is all about asking those questions. In our house we have hundreds of books well never get rid of. Because books bring us joy and knowledge and great satisfaction. You can always pick up a book and read it. Books never go out of style. But in my house there are plenty of clothes well get rid of. I dont think its an unworthy goal to push yourself to question whether or not you really need another pair of shoes or another novelty sweater. What purpose does having more of that shit fulfill? I think its where people start to throw shade or feel morally superior about minimalism that everything goes off the rails. ,femalefashionadvice,dejvlc9,65,t5_2s8o5
11049079,0,t3_5xqaxw,I noticed this with Aeropostale too. A lot of them have closed in my local malls  I actually just started liking them too because they r actually pretty cheap and have cute stuff that arent ostentatious like aampf etc,femalefashionadvice,deke74p,2,t5_2s8o5
11050767,0,t3_5xozcc,I kind of feel like whoever wrote this needed to do a better job of differentiating between the different things that minimalism can refer to because it does come across as quite judgemental. Theres minimalism born out of necessity  people who have few possessions because they cant afford them or fit them or something else. Theres minimalism as a philosophy  like Kondos methods where you only have possessions because you truly appreciate them and you dont see the need to have clutter. Then theres the type of minimalism that I think hope? the authors referring to here which is the aesthetic. You have your pretty white furniture with your black lamp and everythings all lined up perfectly and you take lots of pictures for your social media etc etc. Thats very different to the other two types and so I can understand where the authors coming from.But having said that this its so instagrammable look at me watch me flaunt my positive quality e.g richness mentality happens with pretty much EVERYTHING. It isnt unique to minimalism  people find a way to get all haughty over literally anything. I dont think that blaming the tool in this instance is actually productive. If a person is going to be all snooty and have a superiority complex about something chances are theyre going to find a way to express that whether they have a minimalist penthouse or not. I dont think that minimalism is inherently tied to superiority.,femalefashionadvice,dekl2zb,12,t5_2s8o5

11062917,0,t3_5xv4s7,Yes!! Thank you for this.Ive recently done a huge purge on my wardrobe I gave friends first pickings the rest I gave to my amazing cleaner who will keep some and give the rest to her friendsfamily in the Philippines the stuff that was no longer wearable has been cut up to use as cleaning cloths.Ive been tracking every outfit I wear so when it comes around to doing my next purge Ill know which items to keep and which ones can be donatedI have two pairs of jeans I got from River Island and Ive noticed everything else is mostly from HampM. I live in the UAE so finding affordable but still nice clothes is really hard we have Namshi and then places like HampM. I aspire to one day being able to afford the likes of Ted Baker Kooples Kate Spade but for now Im happy with what I have.Its all about taking care of the clothes you do have. I remove clothes that no longer fit and Im making a much bigger effort to be more conscious of what I buy. Its been hard to break the habit of this is amazing I love it but then discovering its not actually my style and I never wear it and then I throw it out.Im actually trying to stop spending on clothes and stick to what I own apart from when I go home in a few days and will have access to Primark.I read that article on minimalism yesterday and I think theres a difference between Minimalism as an aesthetic vs minimalism as a practicality. My wardrobe is becoming minimalist in that I have a few items I wear or mix and match but my style doesnt fit the white on white wispy look or the French girl capsule wardrobe look.,femalefashionadvice,delyp2v,2,t5_2s8o5

11102153,0,t1_deqek2r,Another issue with my local Goodwills is that they have boutique racks where theyre supposed to take the higher end items and give them individual higher prices. Buuuut the employees dont really seem to know about clothes they take anything thats half decent put it on the rack and give it a ridiculous price. So the regular racks have very few items that are good or interesting. Shoes are also individually priced and again tend to cost too much.And yeah youre not gonna be able to make many thrift shop purchases unless you can dedicate a lot of time to it. What you save in money youre paying for in time and the people who have all of those cool finds probably go regularly. doesnt help that in a lot of places resellers raid the stores constantly and take all of the good stuff I have three Goodwills within short driving distance a Platos Closet and a handful of nonfranchise thrift and resale stores. Even with those options I still dont buy a ton of stuff. More often than not I dont buy anything and buying more than one item with exception of jeans shopping at Platos Closet they always have a lot of jeans in my size is a big score for me ha ha.,femalefashionadvice,deqf3y4,1,t5_2s8o5

Ill generally buy what I want under  or so but since Im trying to lose weight I rarely spend that since I dont want to buy things I cant wear in a year or so. Most Ive ever spend on a single item is  for my purse which I love and carry every day. Since I want to enjoy shopping in a more ethical and environmentallyfriendly way I want to start thrifting more. I love shopping and get bored of my clothes easily I am SO not a French wardrobe person! so thrifting makes sense since I can trade my old clothes in. I probably wont reach a point in my life where Im regularly spending gt an item no matter how much I make  clothes are something I am kind of pennyfoolish on Ill spend more for work clothes and items I really love but having tons of designer clothes bags and shoes dont count! would just make me feel weird. Id say the median cost per piece in my closet is about  average may be a bit more? Maybe .I think I spend a bit too much on clothes even though I can reasonably afford since I dont have too many expenses. I dont necessarily think certain items are contributing to the style I want even though they may be nice individually. I get the best compliments on my thrifted clothes and its nice to not be wearing the same outfit as everyone else. Obviously I would love a closet full of Anthropologie full price not the clearance room that peasants like me are banished to but that is more a want than a need and if I wanted an individual piece I could just get it even though Id feel very weird paying  for a dress.

How much does it further feminism for those  people to be given better benefits and talked to more nicely by their CEO?

11268836,0,t1_df880bo,I have very fine hair slightly wavy hair and tons of it. I use a Babyliss Pro  curling iron the blue one and never have any issues with curls falling. I always curl when my blowdry is a day old. If I know I am going to curl my hair the next day I use the following styling products before blowdrying Alterna Caviar Moisture Milk little bit rub in my hands and then spread evenly through hair concentrating on roots Bumble amp Bumble Repair Blow Dry about a quartersize dollop spread evenly through hair Moroccan Oil Volumizing Mousse dollop rub into roots with my fingersThen I brush  my hair with a wet brush and blow dry with a big round brush working in sections. I usually pin up the top half of my hair and blow dry the bottom half first then take down the top and blow that dry. When I curl my hair the next day I spray all over with a little bit of heat protection spray right now I am using a CHI one from the drugstore its meh and pin my crown hair up. I curl alternating away from then towards my face. I usually use the curling iron the hottest it will go and leave in place for  seconds depending on how tight I want the curl. After removing the iron I hold the curl in my hand close to my scalp for  seconds to give it a chance to set. I follow with the Living Proof flex shaping hair spray and turn my head upside down and then run my fingers or a brush through the curls to loosen. Works and holds every time! I think the real secret is hair that was washed a day or two prior so its not so slippy. ,femalefashionadvice,df9b0pr,2,t5_2s8o5

Haircuts  I use this method Keep in mind that the ends usually turn out fairly blunt so Id recommend another method if youre curly or just prefer fairytail ends. Shampooconditioner  LUSH bars last a good  months if you dont wash your hair often. Clothes  Capsule wardrobe with a strict colour palette I also order from private sale websites like Vente Prive since theyve ridiculous deals sometimes. Ive not had much luck with charity shops but Ive bought a lot of decent stuff from eBay. I actually spend a lot on clothes since they need to be just so in order to work with the rest of my wardrobe. Compared to the average American I probably still own very little. Waxing  Epistick for facial hair cutup wax leg strips for my brows epilator for legarmpit hair safety razor and shaving soap for everything else. On average  for six months worth of shaving. Make up  I wear minimal makeup and know what suits me in terms of shade undertone finish texture etc. Makeup and skincare are probably the only things I spend a lot of money on. My perfume was also quite pricey. Ditto sunscreen. Approx. month excluding perfume which Ive been using for years and years.

I feel like I wear mostly leggings and my excuse was always that I was trying to lose weight but its just not happening so I think I might be giving in the next few weeks and buying some real pants. Also planning on getting a floor mirror for the bedroom for better pictures with more light.    Whole album if you dont like individual links From most recent    Friday  I was really grumpy and wanted to make it obvious that I wasnt trying but I ended up actually liking this outfit. Shirt is from Crossroads leggings are HUE sweater is Uniqlo and my new Birkenstocks.    Worn to work Tuesday I really like this dress as far as just throwing something on and being comfortable and not having to worry about sweaters or anything. Dress and scarf are Target and shoes are my wedding sandals from TOMS.    Worn to Target last weekend second pic  Trying to break in my Swedish Hasbeens and just wear them out for little excursions. My husband says I cant wear this dress around him because it messes with his eyes. Also I dont know if anyone can tell but I had just used selftanner on my legs and I think it turned out pretty damn well. Dress and jacket are Old Navy.    Worn to night class I think this has too many patterns going on. Shirt and scarf from Target Gap sweater and booties from Target. Im really starting to hate the booties they look so cheap but I got them on clearance for  and the DEALZZZZ.    Worn to day class I would wear this everyday if I could. Shirt is Old Navy Gap sweater leggings from Target probably and shoes too.    Worn to work a little bit ago I actually really like this outfit too. Shirt from UO jacket is the same Old Navy jacket leggings from wherever and the boots are GH Bass that Ive had for probably five years.

If youve never done it before err on the side of caution and cut a couple of inches longer than you think you should. Try them on and adjust from there either roll up the bottom so they hit where you want or take them off and trim a bit of the excess length.For anyone reading this take heed it seems simple and it mostly is but if you cut too short or at the wrong angle I somehow once cut the legs on a weird angle so that the outer side was an appropriate length and the inseam was like underwear. ,femalefashionadvice,dfxluxj,2,t5_2s8o5

11531286,0,t1_dg25t7u,I have had pretty good experiences with them. I have purchased about  dresses and four shirts from them and have only had three of those purchases having problems  two of which were my fault and the third was a case of oh I had NO IDEA there was a window here.  the first  I forgot my chest measurements for one they measure chest and bust separately when youre doing a custom fit was too lazy to find a tape measure guessed got it wrong and ended up with a dress that I had to do extra tailoring on around the bust. The second was me not reading the fabric composition correctly so I ordered a normal size  which fits me perfectly  if Im ordering the cotton knit fabric.  Instead it was the cotton poplin which is not stretchy at all so the dress was wayyyyy too tight  only wearable if I was basically wearing spanx everything underneath. Normally if I order the cotton poplin I have to add a half inch to everything and make sure that the upper armsleeve measurement is increased by about  inches i have big shouldersbicepsThe third was THIS dress. I thought the knotting work at the throat was just a design thing  I didnt realize it wasnt all sewn together.  So I ordered my normal size   only to discover that the knotting was not sewn together and when I put it on it gaped into this big window right over my boobs.   Thankfully I have a tanktop in the EXACT same colour so I just wear it underneath and it doesnt look super xrated.

This happens all! the! time! and while I dont think the chickenoregg conversation about which came first the snarkiness or the defensive tantrums is necessarily answerable I do think its worth keeping in mind that theres more than one side to the tonal landscape of this subreddit.,femalefashionadvice,dg4zdkx,3,t5_2s8o5
11548789,0,t1_dg51nhq,Sorry when I asked you that question it was largely rhetorical. It was a way of saying look the community already worked the way it was supposed to by checking and penalizing this person who said something you didnt like so when you say people should be held accountable it sounds like you dont think that was sufficient accountability and I think it clearly was. I didnt expect you to answer with an actual request.I would really challenge you not to place either of the threads you mentioned as examples on the same spectrum as the reaction to last weeks plus sized inspo post  an episode that involved hundreds of people brigading FFA from other subs in order to make hateful and harassing comments rooted in prejudice against a particular group of people and which had nothing whatsoever to do with fashion. Placing this inspo album kinda sucks on the same scale as fat people are a disgusting drain on society lends an excess of drama to the former while severely trivializing the latter.

Since youre Australian some of the brands I love are Tigerlily and Spell Designs little more boho but some amazing prints Gorman for something more quirky Ryder Label they have amazing floral prints which are Australian bush flowers. For cheaper alternatives HampM Zara etc have some cute prints but I find I have to hunt around more to find things I like. Quirky Circus found in Myer I think also has some cute options from time to time! In winter I like to wear my normal gear under a coat since that will be coming off anyway and since my coat is plainbasic I always wear a printed or coloured scarf to amp things up a bit. ,femalefashionadvice,dg93k5o,1,t5_2s8o5

11588673,0,t3_65d31t,Hello fellow ex Mormon! My postMormon period was filled with some crazy outfit experimentation. So maybe I can help!First shorts are like jeans. You can dress them up or down. Some jeans are nicer some edgier. Things to be aware of how do the shorts fit? To they ride up? Do they scrunch up between your legs when you walk? What are they like when you bend over? Not all shorts are equal! What is your preferred inseam? As a lady your height I automatically rule out any shorts with a  inch or less inseam. It seems fine until I have to move around or sit down and then they feel REAL short. Do the shorts sit on your hips or at your waist? Are they tight around your leg or flared? The Mormon Bermuda short look is pretty much onestyle fits all but there is more out there! Find out what you like and what works for you. Styling I started my shorts journey with something pretty basic. One pair of shorts I loved and felt comfortable in and I could move in. One stripped top. A pair of keds. Bam. Simple easy. Great first step when I was already feeling self conscious about how much bare leg I was showing. Now I have all different variations. I love a high waisted shirt with a flared leg that hits mid thigh and a nice white button up shirt no sleeves short sleeves or long sleeves tucked in. It makes me feel sophisticated even when its hot outside. I wear it with a pair of white platform sneakers or a pair of cute buckled flats or a sandal. But I can also add a pair of tights and some boots for cooler weather. Shorts can get rumpled or creases easily depending on the fabric so I stick to stiffer fabrics that can hold their shape better. Especially if Im sweating a lot. My biggest piece of advice is to ease in. If you arent comfortable and happy with the shorts and constantly have to adjust them or tug at them its not going to be fun and youll feel even more exposed. Good luck! And have fun! I personally thing the greatest irony in my postreligious life is that my personal style is far more modest than my Mormon look. Albeit far from the Utah Valley approach.  Freed from the expectations of Mormon aesthetics I found out I hate short things for the most part and Im not a huge color fan. My aesthetic has been described as a Professional Goth meets s Librarian. Ive never felt more myself. Its been the best!,femalefashionadvice,dg9l0k2,11,t5_2s8o5

11739362,0,t1_dgqic0g,I recently dyed my hair a bright color for the first time as an adult and it turned out amazingly! I did some research and used the Manic Panic Lightening bleach kit and it was great no smell no burning no frizzy orange burnt out ends. My hair was actually super soft and smelled great after I bleached it! I used Jerome Russells Punky Color for my dye and no developer and the color came out super rich and even. Let me know if you have any questions enjoy your new hair!!,femalefashionadvice,dgqoq9h,6,t5_2s8o5

11755195,0,t1_dgsgqv2,Both in that sense. But honestly thats only been a trend in the past like  years so it doesnt really relate to millenials older than  or so... Im sure itll take a couple years to look back and see what color defined this generation. I think the abercrombie  american eagle pink defined the early s for sure now that I look back at pictures but I never would have known that at the time.,femalefashionadvice,dgshbqz,2,t5_2s8o5

11768081,0,t3_67vj1h,I bought this T by Alexander Wang cardigan for  from eBay because I was super convinced I needed an oxblood cardigan. When it came it was a lot more brown than red which I hadnt expected from the picture the fit of the shoulders was super weird and the knit was this weird chunky cotton blend that made me sweat while not actually being that warm. For a month I tried to sell it on Poshmark and eBay but got frustrated at the lack of attention my listing was getting and donated it. Id been pretty excited before it arrived because of the brand name but maybe they just dont do knits that well...,femalefashionadvice,dgtxy2j,7,t5_2s8o5
