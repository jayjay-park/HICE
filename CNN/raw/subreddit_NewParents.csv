206571,0,t3_1wh5f8,Introverted mom with two boys  years and  months. The good news once they hit about  you have some time to yourself. The bad news? Once If you have another one you have  time to yourself. Ive learned to treat my alone time as when Im nursing my youngest. I do what I want I browse reddit read a book even watch some tv on my phone.  The baby is normally sleeping anyways so its almost like hes not even there. Not going to lie though it was extremely hard the first month with my second.  He wouldnt sleep unless he was sleeping on me so someone was touching me literally  hours a day.  By the th week it was like bugs crawling on my skin. I just wanted to be left alone. The baby doesnt prefer my husband so it was only me who could soothe him and feed him. My husband only did diaper changes and bath time.  Youll eventually get into a rhythm and find out what works for both of you.  Just remember to talk to each other and never assume anything. ,NewParents,cf1z00o,4,t5_2snqi

The odds of it benefiting someone else either via treatment or research are much higher.  Thats why the American Academy of Pediatrics has basically accused private cord blood banks of preying on the fears of new parents. Donation is generally free too!  Here is a good source of info for within the USA.Here is the survey to see if you are eligible to donate and if you are then they will get you in touch with the closest donation center.,NewParents,ci4iqe1,3,t5_2snqi

1889166,0,t3_2g7moo,I think there is many things to do. Food is the basis for everything good health wise. I think its very good of you to search for answeres and trying to prevent stretch marks! The motivation is half the battle. I use biooil as its cheaper and makes my skin soft but this isnt going to work all by itself. Eating a smoothie every morning where you hide dark leafy greens in it helps build up skin cells and eating avocado and salmon and all that good stuff helps with the elasticity. Smoothie is good for constipation as well When you eat a lot of sugar and dont balance it with a lot of water your skin noticably changes to puffy reddish worn out skin. I mean Im preggo and have made this mistake then I try to drink a lot and eat healthy for as long as I start feeling better and also  times a week I dry brush my skin starting from the feet and work my way upjust before shower to was off the dead skin and activate the blood vessels under the skin then Mb later in pregnancy I will do it more often on the more important areas. Also walking outside  in fresh air stimulates the body to work properly and gives you the famous pregnancy glow. But know when ever you feel itchy and you just want to scratch also put oil on it. Thats the first sign that your skin is stretching not neccessarily that stretch marks are forming just that your expanding. And after all this if you get them then thats the genetics but you already helped your body a lot. Hope this helps. Enjoy your pregnancy,NewParents,ckgu48c,2,t5_2snqi

3398852,0,t3_2z3dn8,Well we finally came home from  days recovery in the hospital exhausted sleep deprived and in utter bliss with our new baby girl. Still sleeping from her first car ride of her life we plopped her down on the couch and thought about introducing the cat. But first things first my wife needed a stool softener as those are the type of fun things that come along with labour. As fine motor skills are compromised in such a state I dropped the entire bottle of gel caps on the floor. After letting out a sigh of defeat I began to pick them up... Only to notice the cat has now projectile vomited across the room is foaming at the mouth and convulsing!!! While my wife is calling poison control Im pinning the cat in the bath tub spraying his mouth with our shower head and am now bleeding heavily from his ferocious defense from aid. After speaking with poison control and thoroughly rinsing the cat... We walked back into the living room  min later still sleepy and exhausted but now all three of us wet and bleeding... To find our new bundle of joy still sleeping happily in her car seat. TLDR almost killed the cat within  minutes of being home. ,NewParents,cpfp1cf,5,t5_2snqi

If your baby isnt moving at least  times within a two hour period this is at any given time during the day not every two hours there could be something wrong. I would go get checked out right away. Its better to go get checked if you arent sure. This was our first baby too and I was constantly researching and getting checked if I wasnt sure about something. Hope everything goes well for you and your new family! ,NewParents,cplsej5,1,t5_2snqi

4189961,1,t1_crxucw3,Then you might want to clarify your point because it really sounds like youre complaining about the fact that they wouldnt allow you to take your newborn into an r rated movie. I dont really understand what exactly is humiliating about being told about their policy even if it was after they had already sold you the ticket. Perhaps they dont have an overwhelming number of people trying to take their newborns into an rrated movie. Now if they refused to give you a refund after you told them that you didnt want to see a different movie I could understand you being upset. But from your story I dont really personally see that the theater did anything necessarily wrong. ,NewParents,crxusxf,0,t5_2snqi

6422670,0,t3_43ngkx,Breastfeeding just doesnt come easily to everyone. I felt like the worst mother in the world because my milk just didnt come in after my first baby was born. I had to start her on formula on day three because shed lost nearly a pound while Id been desperately trying to nurse her every  minutes.Its really okay. If you were going to send baby to daycare and go back to work he was going to need to take a bottle eventually anyway. Drinking some of his milk from bottles is far from the end of the world and doesnt mess up breastfeeding for the vast majority of babies. Just take a deep breath and remember that as long as hes getting milk in his tummy its all going to turn out well in the end.,NewParents,czjn2jk,5,t5_2snqi

6603984,0,t3_4645nn,Im in a similar position with my  year old.  He often eats more than my wife does on a given day but is still under  in weight and under  in height.  He has always been the very bottom side of the curve.  He was born  weeks premature so I guess that explains some of it.I try not to worry about it too much.  My wife once showed me that he would be close to normal on an older European chart.  We feed him real food that we prepare ourselves and dont force him to eat if hes not hungry.  Im sure if we started him on a diet of french fries candy and soda we could fatten him up but that would surely cause bigger problems down the line.Finally Im sure your doctor just gave you the data because its available.  Im sure heshe would have discussed your daughters weight if there was any cause for concern.,NewParents,d02enj1,6,t5_2snqi

Unfortunately it often feels likeI have to really smack her bottom pretty forcefully to get her relax    Luckily shes in cloth diapers so theres padding but ...jeez.  I dont understand how she can calm down to such a beating She fights out of the swaddle regular swaddle recieving blanket towel or swaddle sack... she fights so hard....I dont dare leave her on her side unless Im cradling her in bed.And yea... shushing til Im dizzy.  I dont have a swing but I find the carrier works well when were outside but I dont want to have to use it everytime I want to put her to bed so I havent used it in the house but if I get desperate enough might just have to.  ,NewParents,dc5mfjh,2,t5_2snqi
10363910,0,t3_5oehl8,I dont have any experience with the formula you are using but our LO is on similac neosure and the pedi is extremely reluctant to take her off of it since she was only at the nd centile at her  month appointment. As soon as she stopped getting breastmilk only  bottles per day she became constipated. Like cat poop hard once every  days with LOTS of help from mommy and daddy constipated. Pear and apple juice  oz as she was  months old at the time did not work for us and glycerine suppositories only provided relief for the existing bowel movement. Half an ounce of prune juice with a bottle once a day has kept her regular until the past couple of days. She recently started eating more so we have been thinking that if we up it to half an ounce in the morning and half an ounce in the evening it will get her back on track. It has only been a couple of weeks for us but it seems like juice is an ongoing remedy. For us it is worth it since more calories hopefully equals more growth for our little preemie. ,NewParents,dcit781,2,t5_2snqi

11038823,0,t3_5xmisb,Tiredness is the worst! If you have inadvertently passed your cold onto your baby dont worry  it happens! Keep an eye on her temperature though and see a doctor if she starts to run a fever or if anything just feels off. Theres nothing like a parents instinct. Both of my boys had cold after cold as babies and they rarely get them now. If youre worried about whether shes getting enough milk keep a close eye on her weight. My eldest son would always cry if he wasnt on the breast and I thought it was because he liked the comfort but I saw my midwife and got him weighed just in case. It turned out there was a problem with my milk supply and I was advised to top up every feed with formula temporarily while making sure I ate and slept as much as I could to help boost my supply. I felt terribly guilty at the time having to do this but the improvement was immediate and I was able to gradually remove the bottle and breast feed exclusively for a year or so. I couldnt see it at the time but I was so focussed on looking after my baby I forgot about myself. Good luck hope things improve soon.I hope you dont mind but I have a baby blog that you might find useful a bit further down the line. Hope its useful ,NewParents,dej8c0k,12,t5_2snqi
