5513447,0,t3_3qlzqv,Every battery is rated for a certain amount of charges regardless of which device it is being used with. Faster charging degrades the battery faster as it is a trade off between convenience and longevity.You can try and increase battery longevity by avoiding heat when charging and not running the battery down completely on a consistent basis. Or by charging slower or simply by not using charge cycles.You can read Googles official Battery lifespan charging amp usage tips here.On a side note it would seem device manufacturers are avoiding increasing battery longevity or at least avoiding investing in the technologies that would allow them to do so as less people would be upgrading on a year or  basis if our batteries werent degrading as quickly. Theres actually a small startup company thats promising huge increases in battery longevity using nothing more than a small microchip but neither laptop nor phone manufacturers have shown even the slightest interest according to them sorry no source on hand.,nexus5x,cwge5ul,1,t5_39t31

5656994,0,t3_3qfekg,What you need to do is to login to your Verizon acct through My Verizon Mobile app. Im not sure if you can install it through the play store or not. Once in that app you can go to manage your features and you can actually remove the basic visual voice mail feature. After that it take a few hours for it to get removed and so that you no longer get those text messages. Disclaimer I never tried this for x but I did do this when I switched from S uses free visual voice mail to a moto x. I was getting those texts and I deleted the basic visual voice mail feature as described and that took care of it. But it did take overnight to take effect. Through the Verizon account page online there is no option to delete that feature. You can only do that through the app. If you have multiple lines on the account you can do it through any line. another thing you can do is to swap the sim card with a phone which does not support basic free visual voice mail and then have Verizon remove the basic visual voice mail they cant force you to subscribe to the month premium plan. Or use the Verizon account app on that phone. Once they remove it then switch back to nexus x.,nexus5x,cwyazuy,2,t5_39t31

5711084,0,t1_cx4x1wl,I dont care about artistic design decisionsonly engineering design decisions. They got a lot right with the Nexus X. The main speaker is on the front because thats where my ears are. Compare this to the Nexus  with speakers on the bottom or the LG G with speakers on the back! Speakers on the front needs to become a thing Power button and volume buttons within normal thumb reach for righthanded users power button might be awkward for lefthanded users. These buttons are closer to the bottom than the Nexus  despite the phone being quite a bit taller. .mm audio port on the bottom means the headphone cord wont get in the way of the screen. a goodquality frontfacing camera. Seriously MP frontfacing cameras make me feel like Im using a camera that belongs on a flip phone from . Large battery. I dont know why people are crapping on phones for having short battery life when they should be crapping on the app developers who prevent the phone from going to sleep or requesting sensor data that it doesnt really need. Does the Facebook app really need to ask your device for its location when its not open? Yes Android should do a better job of queueing and consolidating lowpriority sensor update requests or reject frequent sensor update requests altogether but app developers need to take responsibility for fixing their apps to use newer APIs. If you uninstall apps you dont regularly need and find alternatives apps that require fewer permissions youre less likely to have battery problems.,nexus5x,cx50kmj,4,t5_39t31

5983253,0,t1_cy3uobx,It isnt quite the same as a PC. The PCs PSU is actually powering the components so it needs to be able to source the proper current or it will burn up the supply and potentially take components with it. Charging a phone feeds the charging circuit meant for the battery and isnt supposed to power the device so it doesnt need as high of a  current.The charging device will be fine with lower current but it does impact the rate at which it charges and if you are consuming too much power it could still be loosing battery or effectively not charging. You definitely can have issues with going USB C to A and the cable not being compliant causing it to try pulling too much current from the A port but C to C I wouldnt be too concerned with since it is meant to be able to do that android even offers the option to charge other devices in USB options. In this case it seems like it is using up more power than its worth through the convertingcharging. Probably not supplying much current either.,nexus5x,cy3xp4n,2,t5_39t31

6130491,0,t3_3zgfd1,Ive had my x for a couple of weeks now.My biggest complaint is the low volume output through the headphone jack. I use my phone at work to listen to music through a small stereo. With the volume maxed out on the stereo and phone it is still really quiet. Really bummed me out. I have to bring my ipod with me and use that instead of my phone. The volume out the speaker is also really bad but I dont use it nearly as much as the headphone jack. Im not much of a power usergamer and I dont use the camera excessively so I dont have any lag complaints there. Battery life is also much better than the S I came from. ,nexus5x,cymh1g3,2,t5_39t31
6131350,0,t3_3zj53i,I usually keep my phones in a fitBAG so that I can use them naked. However due to the known problem with the NXs soft touch finish getting smudged up very easily even on the black model I decided to go with a case and TGSP combo this time around.I wanted a minimal hard plastic case with button cutouts so the Spigen Thin Fit was the perfect match for my needs  its a great case. However the one thing wrong with this case and with any case for that matter is that it hides the Nexus logo on the back of the phone. I dont want it to look like Im carrying just another generic Samsung Galaxy Ace  Turbo Ive made a concious decision about the phone Im using and I want it to show.So I decided to fix it myself by slapping a dbrand skin with Nexus logo on top of my case. Installation was easy the application was pretty similar to the standard procedure of sticking the skin to the phone itself.I only had to improvise a little around the cutouts the case has one rectangular cutout for the flash and laser ports but the skin has two separate cutouts with a divider in the middle so I had to heat up and stretch that part of the skin a bit so it would stick to the back of the phone. Same thing with the cases camera cutout which slopes down a bit so I had to heat up the skin around there as well to get it to stick down.Overall Im quite pleased with the result  its not perfect but its definitely a lot nicer than the boring look of the plain black case! The feel of the matte dbrand skin is great too its a bit more slippery than the case itself but definitely grippy enough.Thought Id share because anyone can repeat this procedure with any skin combo they like. Basically you can have your phone both protected by the case AND styled with a skin to your liking!,nexus5x,cymkjv3,1,t5_39t31

6338362,0,t3_42csf5,I have bought the grey flannel case from Google store and I bought the black one from eBay china. On the grey one every single port opening is perfect. But on the black one the two mic ports one on top edge and one on the bottom edge the cutouts are a bit off but the hole is still visible and still picks up sound when I tested recording. On the grey one it coves my screen fully all around the edges and a better overlap on the screen protector. On the black case it is slightly off all around and I do notice more dust getting right in between the edge of the screen protector and the phone. Also the flannel on the black case at the top edge seems to be wearing off eventually it looks like it might peel right off since thats the way I stick my phone in my pocket. I have not noticed it much on the grey case so far. Also on the black case the fingerprint camera flash  IR cutouts seems to be aligned better than the grey case. Overall they are both a good case unless specific phones made for the Chinese market where the mic port is maybe made differently than US phones I dont know if thats the reason why the mic port cutouts dont line up. But I only have two in a million cases  every one will be different.,nexus5x,cza3nsp,2,t5_39t31

8199823,0,t3_4rn0jl,There is something messed up with the caching with MTP connections on the phone.  I dont know where the problem is on the x but my DCIMCamera folder doesnt show up either.  MTP isnt presenting you the actual filesystem.  There is some process that provides MTP with a filtered view of your filesystem.  This app is getting out of sync.I made the mistake of clearing media andor external storage and it triggered a recreation of the media data.  Unfortunately it seems some indexes got reordered and all my ringtones are pointing at random sounds after the data got regenerated.  Also that process didnt allow DCIMCamera to be visible so it was pointless.I did find that I could switch to PTP mode and I could see Camera.  Downloading the pictures was fine but for downloading videos the PTP system wanted to convert the MPEG files to MPEG.This is the nd time Ive broken the ordering for media sounds on this phone.  Last time I did it I didnt know this would happen.  This time I used Titanium to backup external storage and media storage but after restoring and rebooting the sound index was still messed up.In the end I think the easiest way for me to download was to just use ADBadb pull sdcardDCIM,nexus5x,d52j5d5,1,t5_39t31

This causes the exclamation mark on the wifi indicator though the internet will work nothing Googlerelated will. You will need to install a VPN product. Some VPNs with endpoints in Japan can get out to Google. Using VPNs in China can be frustrating though because they have become better at detecting them. Now some products also encrypt the VPN packet headers to make detection harder but if you find your VPN tunnel to be really unreliable this tends to be why. If you install a VPN product check its settings for special modes that provide the extra packet header encryption  these usually require turning on manually and may limit the list of endpoints you can choose from.FYI never ever send any communication to anyone against Chinas interest while in China nor access anything they might want to restrict access to.

11147645,0,t1_devk0eh,Is the flaw due to hardware design or the manufacturing process? Im just spitballing here so bear with me  Assuming the issue was the latter  would that necessitate a new HW revision version if they corrected the process on their end but didnt change the components themselves?  E.g. used a slightly different solder formula or made changes to the manufacturing sequence?  I have an extra year warranty through my credit card and the pixel will be more than a year old by the time thats up but it just seems strange that google would keep selling phones that they know will break especially for how cheap the x sells for.  The already slim margins would seem to be completey obliterated by the costs of replacing all these handsets I would think. ,nexus5x,devknu7,1,t5_39t31

11553223,0,t3_5l66de,LG has decided to really screw their customers in India over with this one ...  My phone froze and went into a boot loop on the st of Jan so I immediately took it to the service center. At this point my phone was about  days out of its warranty period but having read about the issues for a few weeks before then I made it a point to ask about the free replacement.  The lady at the desk told me that while this might be an international policy they hadnt received any memo re the same in India.  Ended up paying Rs. . approximately US  for the motherboard replacement and went my way.  Almost exactly  months later a friend had the same issue and sent their phone to the same service center where the part was replaced for free.  Turns out LG has extended the warranty on the phone to  months but they will not refund the cost of repairs to people who paid for it before the decision to extend the warranty was taken ...  Good job LG.  ,nexus5x,dg5k7zv,3,t5_39t31
