4499909,0,t1_csx6u3h,gt Extension support is being worked at and should be ready soonish. That is great to hear. I am an old time Opera user version  I think but these days I am extremely extension dependent. Extension support is one thing thats stopping me from using Vivaldi full time.Oh and thank you very much for keeping us informed. It is greatly appreciated.,vivaldibrowser,csxv8wq,3,t5_35tfc

Ive only been using Reddit Facebook Youtube and the like so I cant imagine that the sites are whats causing it.Windows  has all around been really slow and buggy for me over the past  hours or so that Ive been using it so it might not even be a problem specifically with Vivaldi.

8738054,0,t3_4zpapz,The one major security pitfall that it has imho script blocker extensions dont currently work.  So if you rely on something like ScriptSafe noscript firefox for a secure browsing experience youll likely have a more difficult time here.  You can setup Ublock Origin and UMatrix to block first and third party scripts as a workaround but I wouldnt be setting it up as a Tor Browser on a Tails install just yet.It also still does connect to some Google servers but it has a lot less Google integration than Chrome which is a good step.  They also recently fixed the Web RTC IP leaking see settings menu.,vivaldibrowser,d6xwmpa,3,t5_35tfc
