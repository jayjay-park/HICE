7294424,0,t1_d27b51m,Good point there. But if so they shouldve at least arranged the groups like that random mixture of all the sub kteams beforehand. Now the groups are officially grouped horizontally while in fact you never know what you get from a ..k team. I agree that forming weak groups just leads to unattractive stomps later in the playoffs also for the spectators that are more likely to show up in the later stages of the tournament.,learndota2league,d27bron,1,t5_3d5iz

7308273,0,t1_d28w6fq,I guess you feel stupid now because you read the comment and realized that I was talking more about the k guy feeling entitled to a handicap in a competitive tournament rather than trying to put him down for being bad.  And no I dont want to scrim.,learndota2league,d28wfvo,1,t5_3d5iz
7308356,0,t1_d28wfvo,I dont feel stupid at all. This league is called Learn Dota . Its literally for learning the game. If you give a shit about winning this so you can brag do you man. This tourney is geared towards lower mmr. Toxic fucks like you are the plague of our mmr and theres a reason youll always fucking be stuck in k. Oh wait based off of your recent comments I guess youve spammed a hero to .k which means youre not eligible for the league anyways which further reinforces my idea that youre a piece of shit.,learndota2league,d28ws47,1,t5_3d5iz

7592572,0,t1_d34wy5k,Yeah and thats what i meant by the rest of what i wrote in that paragraph. When I signed up for this tourney my hope was to meet some new dota friends and play some fun matches with my new team. The latter was not the case in the first match after the reset. But yeah we have learned a whole lot like i said.Like one of the other replies said i can be really disheartening being stomped in  minutes and you have no clue what the hell happened during the match. The gradually more challenging opponents that the old format could have provided would have mitigated some of that.,learndota2league,d358jz8,1,t5_3d5iz
7809979,0,t3_4m3u23,Hey  whats your teams average mmr? I have a  stack with a K average. If were around each others mmr wed be down to schedule times to practice against each other.DotabuffSteam,learndota2league,d3twm5z,1,t5_3d5iz
7894467,0,t1_d4338sf,To OP I think this means that your team average mmr is not allowed to change more than  from a standin. For anyone looking to standin their average team MMR is  it seems. Would love to standin myself but Im not allowed to. ,learndota2league,d43eu0n,1,t5_3d5iz
