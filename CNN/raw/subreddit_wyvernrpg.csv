6200496,0,t1_cyueab8,Not as of right now I was setting it up so that other people could connect with relatively low latency times and I killed some internal process I need to track down and patch. Ill try to push an update in the forum post above sometime before Friday though if I can get it functional again then worry about latency gt.lt,wyvernrpg,cyufhon,1,t5_2wsk4
6482232,1,t3_44dz13,First off change is hard. That being said here is a list of sentences that broke my heartYou WILL have to log in using either Facebook Google or TwitterSo you will be able to do things like purchase Quest Points if you dont want to do quests and it will be pretty cheap. But paying will never be a requirement.The game will of course support inapp purchases.Wyvern is going to be a mobile gamearchery having the game autoselect the right arrow of Slaying based on the monster you tap Man with my other hand being held this sounds hard to do. I guess I will need to buy another armhand from you. How much will that be in the app store? Wowza...Why not make your money on some other bullshit ass mobile pos and put your heart and soul into wyvern like you seemingly want to? Why dumb down such a great game? Oh thats right...She wants money what she wants She wants money what she wantsWhat the fuck does Candy Crush have to do with anything?Sorry for the negative tone. I promise I am excited and that this only stems from fearthe unknown. Like you said give it a shot on a mobile device but fuck...I really dont understand how it could be the samebetter.,wyvernrpg,czpt7me,2,t5_2wsk4
6486882,0,t1_czq07il,Honestly?  Im hoping the game gets so big that Sony offers to write the console version for me.   I have no idea how to write a console game but I do know how to write a PC one.  So depending on how things go I could totally see myself doing PC first.,wyvernrpg,czqaiid,2,t5_2wsk4
6490012,0,t1_czqg5g0,I think what always wins the hearts of gamers is uniqueness.  Wyvern is one of those games Minecraft was one of those games when it came out now in my opinion its one of the worst out there  They go for the younger crowd.I really think all you need to get a game out is two things  Its gotta be unique at least in the style.  Which Wyvern definitely is.  You need to get word out thats the hard part.  Im convinced there are plenty of great games out there that nobody knows about.

7660250,0,t1_czpjvfp,Hello R I was one of the people that was wanting to try to go through and recreate this game before anything was heard from you regarding legal status and what not. I was curious if you were by chance looking for Programmers to help you with any sort of development port it to pc or at least get it started? I would be very interested in helping to get this game back into the glory it use to be when I was a kid and played it any chance I had on the computer. Hopefully you have the time to glance at this message and give me a reply. Thank you much!,wyvernrpg,d3cxdnd,1,t5_2wsk4

8246726,0,t1_d57gkak,As for the blocking  fair enough I am quite convinced that you and your team and eventually the alpha player test will do enough testing to see how it will work. It feels like it will be a whole different game. Then again it works pretty much in most modern MMOs so there is no reason why it wouldnt work in Wyvern. I guess it is something I am used to since  or  WOW! thats  or  years.gt If you and the other person are friends i.e. used the friend command on each other then there will be no filtering. Is that good enough to cover your situations?That is perfect. It is all that Id like but as a precaution there should be an explicit switch to turn it on. As far as I remember you were always aiming at PGish? So if profanity is not allowed by default but can be switched on explicitly to follow the rule you mentioned that would be awesome.,wyvernrpg,d58ea1v,1,t5_2wsk4
8307032,0,t1_d5d0v2p,Ah thank for the clarification.  I see what youre getting at now.For starters I dont think there will be a big separation at all because there will be hundreds of thousands of people vying for the top of the list.  That means theres a much bigger pool of people with ridiculous amounts of time on their hands.  So in a sense I think youre barking up the wrong tree.There will definitely be potential for being discouraged by the leaderboards though so I have a solution Im working on that should make it fun for everyone.,wyvernrpg,d5fxoxk,1,t5_2wsk4

9747522,0,t1_daelbm0,Well actually games as big as maplestory allow all classes and builds to max DPS some builds and classes of course being better than others just like on Wyvern. And these games also have high end enchantment systems based on luck literally like ours that become the only way to get super good items after actually getting the best gear in the game from the raids they would be enchanted then sold for . You get the point atleast!,wyvernrpg,daelerj,1,t5_2wsk4

9903858,0,t1_daxtnzj,Ill get to work on these but one important note  having an unlimited number of items is something thats eventually going to hurt you the game or both.  Its too risky as your player file starts to be many megabytes in size.  I am going to have to institute a hard inventorywide cap on items and Im working through figuring out what the biggest number I can safely support is.,wyvernrpg,dayhv4m,2,t5_2wsk4
9905552,0,t3_5h6ed5,R in your post you say that you would enable aliases for touch ui players if you knew how. Are you serious about that it that was just something you said? I mean if that problem is solved would you revert your decision based on what you said in this post?I think it should be fairly easy to disable the semicolon when the keyboard is enabled. You control the state of the keyboard so it should be just a matter of checking a bool at alias execution time. edit I just saw your hackable reply in a previous post.

9948209,0,t3_5hxy45,Honestly didnt even realize Belladonna was used for Scrying too. I was wondering if there was some hidden reason as to why it was so rare.

10328816,0,t1_dcepgr6,I think whats happening is that some monsters including the cacodemon override the standard XP award  they have a hardcoded number rather than a formula.

10395332,0,t1_dcm9ing,Yeah I only played a Stone Giant years ago out of the Giants because of the  clubs and the insane health bonuses youd get through Cavies Frost was a second due to the Whirlphlosion Axe you could grab early and the fact that you had  axes so you were just a tankier dwarf with resists the only downside being x as opposed to x when I read the wiki and found out Fire Giants had  sword now it makes them the OP ones because DB  Firespray and all of those abilities are far more deadly than Icestorm or Frost Wave or Lightning BoltThunderstorm I specifically think being immune to all fire damage and simply wearing Black DSM and having a few enchants makes you completely immune to everything almost.,wyvernrpg,dcmdlfk,1,t5_2wsk4

With the lowered resists on monsters each destruction cast whether its a rod or spell should do roughly the same damage as before. This is a super nice buff for magic whip. Magic whip would be haltered by resists lack of a guild the need for strength and find weakness on top of all your other utility and Regen skills.
