4128017,0,t1_crqt4zf,Gotta remember Crimson Crush and a huge bunch of all meta gangs are found in Redmond... I know its got its unfriendly elements but thats more due to the more dense living population and lack of law keeping racism in check than there not being a lot of metas. Its a lot easier for racists to act on their urges in Redmond because metas are everywhere and you see them all day. Whilst Puyallup is a bit more isolated bursts of insular communities Tarlisar is a big example of such. This said its a lot worse living in Renton as its more everyday racism that you face harder to find a place to rent people snubbing you day to day in all sorts of places and people just looking the other way.This said Im  willing to shift into living in the TarislarLoveland area. As at the end of the day if youve got ideas to go with this is a half thought through character concept. ,RunByPost,crqtgv1,1,t5_38abb

4333205,0,t1_cse2hds,The drone flies through the apartment starting from the kitchen following a lefthand turn path so as to encounter every room. A summary of its relatively brisk flythrough The kitchen A room with cabinets from the floor becoming a kitchen counter a  burner induction stovetop with a microwave oven underneath and a medium sized sink. There are some cups and a plate on the counter as well one odd appliance that looks like a white rectangle with a vertical cylinder extruding from it.  The main hallway Featuring the entra door as well as a line of key hooks some of which have lanyards with key cards and others with rings of actual keys. The door has a deadbolt but it is not bolted. The living room The room at the opposite end of the hallway which has a multitude of bookcases and  comfortable looking chairs around a coffee table. There are magazines under the coffee table and a chess set on the table. At this point your two drones can see each other. A second hallway A hallway which has the bathroom on the right and bedroom on the left when faced from the living room. The bathroom A relatively mundane if not bare bathroom featuring a full shower toilet and sink but a surprising lack of personal supplies.  The bedroom A room with a large bed and average sized TV across from it along with two bedside stands one on each side of the bed. There are some folders and papers strewn on the bed as well as a computer and a notepad.From the bedroom is loops back into the hallway then living room then kitchen.uNotBb uIkashi ucormicshad uMaxInsanity What do you do?,RunByPost,cse2y0j,1,t5_38abb
