103773,0,t1_ceja8n8,Just receiving this reply from you makes me feel better its disgusting that the medical mafia gets away with this.Thank you Ill let my mum know.,Candida,ceq8v36,3,t5_2qyzp
490742,0,t1_cfw033c,I was feeling pretty crappy for the first  weeks when I got hit with what seemed like a flu all of a sudden it felt like a flu normally would.However after I got over it I had a ton of energy and was eating SO much more.  It was like my body was free unencumbered ready to start living again.It may suck now but trust me its totally worth it!  Theres plenty of great recipes and healthy foods out there that are not only good for you but taste amazing.  People dont usually associated health food with tasting good but if youre open to trying some new things youll be amazed at what you find.,Candida,cfw1u6h,2,t5_2qyzp
2199732,0,t1_clipu77,Actually figured out it wasnt the biotin.  Just took some again with no negative effects.It was the probiotic pickles I was eating.   million bacteria count per ounce and I ate a whole bunch of them.  Ate them again yesterday and got the same breathing trouble.Not sure why....maybe dieoff or something.,Candida,cljfusf,2,t5_2qyzp
2812618,0,t3_2qlip9,Clay worked wonderfully for me it doesnt heal the intestine but I think it cleans it so it can heal better. I hear only great things about clay I cannot recommend it enough !,Candida,cnnsbww,1,t5_2qyzp
3737817,0,t1_cpw7eqb,I think I did the full GAPS diet.  I dont recall any intros.  But I like it a lot actually.  I dont miss the carbs and the only junk food I actually miss is pizza but other than that Im fine.Even after if I get rid of candida I can see myself continuing to eat this healthy. It does get a bit tricky when eating out with friends or going to pastry shops.  I just stick with water and ask do you um.. sell any apples? heheh.Edit  Do you think Im doing it wrong because I skipped the intro?,Candida,cqic2we,1,t5_2qyzp
5468497,0,t1_cwak2xo,Jesus! Why are you still doing this diet and spending all that money? Surely you should be in the clear by now? How could a fungal infection possibly still be an issue after all that for so long.It seems really excessive to spend so much so regularly and still be seeing a naturopath. ,Candida,cwanhkd,2,t5_2qyzp
5815086,0,t1_cxfuhnq,Thats so strange! You sound SUPER sensitive. Dont let your doc get you down. Different people have different trigger foods and it sounds like yours is a little more severe then mine is. Ive realized its all trial and error. Dont be afraid to try new things you may have a reaction but at least youll learn what to avoid and what not to avoid. Make sure to introduce one food at a time. For example Dont do carrots and apples at the same time. Introduce one wait a couple weeks and if no reaction introduce apples. Hope this helps!! ,Candida,cxhwyul,1,t5_2qyzp
6185872,0,t3_407ibz,This is probably bad advice but what I did was take a strong anti fungal and gauge what happened next. In my case I took some black walnut tincture put about  drops in a glass of water and waited. I had taken black walnut before during a cleanse in small amounts so I knew it wasnt going to cause serious side effects.Within  hours I felt like I had flu and spent the next day brain fogged exhausted and sick in bed. Waited a few days then did it again and got the same reaction. I then switched to an antifungal drug from the doctor and the dieoff response was even worse. At that point it was clear I had a systemic fungal infection otherwise I wouldnt have a die off reaction that bad. Again this is not good advice and you really should find a naturopath to help you. This was in August of last year at this point. Im still fighting using probiotics coconut oil diet olive oil and a Chinese herbal formula from my acupuncturist. Pretty sure its in my liver kidneys and possibly my spleen still. Fun times. ,Candida,cysrpbm,3,t5_2qyzp

6676097,0,t1_d09upzk,I started by using Google reaping information from Mercola and influent paleobloggers but my symptoms only marginally improved over a pan of several years.So I requested a psychostimulant from my GP methylphenidate mg and was able for short bursts of time to actually peruse understand and compile the information from more scienceintensive papers. While there is still plenty of grey zones in my understanding of the yeast overgrowth phenomenon Im quite positive A antibiotic usage is the main causal factor B Coconut Oil and Nystatin will trigger JarischHerxheimer if gastrointestinal yeast infection is a problem C Quorumsensing ability is the reason why several yeast strains only become pathological when they reach a certain density.,Candida,d09v79p,1,t5_2qyzp
7336805,0,t3_4fsrt9,These drugs have about  effectiveness or less.  Systematic candida means you are on your death bed about to die from candida in your blood so no need to worry about that.  What you have is CRC candida related complex.  The top causes of CRC include prior antibiotic use birth control and heavy metal toxicity or combination of all .  These drugs dont address the cause.,Candida,d2c57ee,2,t5_2qyzp

7934872,0,t3_4n3sxq,I dont recommend it but I do recommend other anticandida homeopathics.  One is called pleoex which is banned in US by FDA because of a variety of reasons too much to explain but I personally think its because of its effectiveness.  A substitute for this is low mycosis nosode which is created in my town and my ND helped aid them in their formulation of this product.  ,Candida,d47yd7r,1,t5_2qyzp

9199474,0,t1_d8fsyfy,Thank you for your kind words.I have considered it but they are usually private  more expensive then the normal doctors here which are mostly free and they are quite controversial as to if they actually help with more serious stuff like my ongoing problems and symptoms that change every few days a bit  ,Candida,d8i3nf2,1,t5_2qyzp
10218367,0,t1_dc2b5fr,gt To test your candida I believe you would need a biopsy at this point but dont quote me on that.gt Theres a small probability your prostatitis is viral meanwhile theres a greater probability that it is bacterial or fungal. If youve been tested for STDs then it simply rules out sexual transmitted diseases and I believe Candida is not considered an STD although there is a possibility it can be transferred between people. If you have not taken antibiotics then that means you havent ruled out bacterial prostatitis either.gt Candida is present in all stools as it is normal to have some candida within the body so its possible your Candida levels were within their margin of error. In other words how they read the test means they dont consider you to have candida based on whatever levels they detected but this doesnt actually mean you dont have candida elsewhere in the body. Plus if you infection is local to a specific area say your prostate then that doesnt necessarily mean you will have more candida in your GI unless the condition eventually goes systemic which is what happened to me and many other people here because we went untreated for too long.gt Western medicine is somewhat oblivious to candida and most doctors lack even a basic understanding of the condition.gt With all of that said the protocol of supplements Ive recommended addresses your condition from multiple fronts. gt Bromelain is an enzyme and reduces inflammation in the body and prostate.gt Quercitin  gt As for Iodine heres a Google doc someone composed of research gt Cant speak to how accurate everything is but I do know Iodine helped me considerably but it is tricky to figure out and might come with side effects. uapplextrent,Candida,dc2b5l0,1,t5_2qyzp
10249071,0,t3_5mpgst,. I laughed.Part of the problem is gut bacteria research is in its infancy and doctors are lazy just like everyone else. Theyve got the job and theres little reason to expand their knowledge base.,Candida,dc5sejq,3,t5_2qyzp

10571218,0,t1_dd6bfts,In tangent with urasterraster it would be great if you could get back  to a naturopath. Ideally run some tests an find out if you have candida in the first place. The symptoms youve described could be symptoms of candida but possibly not. I feel like you would have had die off symptoms by now if you are two weeks in.,Candida,dd6c6nv,2,t5_2qyzp

11595296,0,t3_6403eg,For external sources Diatomaceous Earth works well even on toe nail fungus however when using it I recommend getting one of those cheap air filter mask off ebay for  as it really sucks to breath as it will dry out your sinuses badly making it hard to breath. However I noticed almost no improvement taking it internally.Internally the best alternative Ive found is a good diet but its a long road to improvement.,Candida,dgac2ut,1,t5_2qyzp
