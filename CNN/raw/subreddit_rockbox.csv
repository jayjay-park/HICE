632306,0,t1_cgc4u9m,It looks like you are doing it right. The command line output says you downloaded version .. of the sansa firmware the latest version is ... Maybe try again with the newer version.,rockbox,cgc56v3,1,t5_2rn0h
2225463,0,t1_clm31tp,gt For example right now it is stuck hanging on the USB Keypad Mode screen after unplugging it from my computer. Im guessing Ill have to wait until the battery dies and I can reboot it and recharge it...Rebooting a locked iPod is easy.  See hereThis uses a hardware reset circuit and should always work unless the buttons are broken.,rockbox,clmpkl7,3,t5_2rn0h
3415224,0,t1_cphgjix,Thanks. That is an option but my preference is to not transcode the files.    I received the player yesterday. I already had a GB MicroSD card that I had previously loaded up with FLAC files. Im happy to report that it accepted the card no problem.    However it wont play FLAC  kHz  bit. It had no problem with FLAC . kHz  bit. I have not Rockboxed it yet. I found this link which suggests Rockbox might fix this problem by transcoding the files on the fly. Otherwise yes I would have to transcode the files down to an acceptable format if I want them to play on this player.    That being said space is not really a concern. My main worry was that with the small screen and small text it would be difficult to navigate the UI on the Sansa Clip and for that reason I thought it might make it quicker if I just got rid of all the stuff that I would never use.,rockbox,cphk5xy,2,t5_2rn0h
9391912,0,t1_d96e039,Many my whole library  I often shuffle everything when I dont know what I feel like listening to. After using the normal ipod interface for so long its an interesting adjustment not being able to shuffle my whole library it a straightforward way. ,rockbox,d96hpfj,2,t5_2rn0h
