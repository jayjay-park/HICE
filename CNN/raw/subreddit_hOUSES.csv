Proper insulation appropriate ventilation etc.Neighbours are another big one  again dunno how old you are but some people dont want neighbours who party all night so worth parking out front on a Friday evening and again on the weekend to see if anyones tuning hot rods or operating a circus in their backyard. Listen out for yappy dogs too.Pubs  clubs within earshot?  hour shops or amenities? Parks that get used at all hours of the night for all kinds of sleazy...stuff? Are you likely to be downwind of a butter factory  sewage plant  abattoir? Worth knowing about.Signs of any mould or infestations  leaks around skylights and windows or near shower stalls. Warped plaster or water stains. New silicone or fresh paint may be a giveaway if theyre wanting to cover up water damage nobody wants to use a bathroom thats leaking everywhere or deal with a house where the walls are filled with mould or timber beams are slowly rotting. Bad  no ventilation in wet areas. Any signs of rodents or termites particularly around the foundations.Security in general. Consider the character and demographics of the neighbourhood and have a think about how youd break in if you were in the mood to do so. Be a bit creative just because you cant haul your own misshapen carcass up a drainpipe it doesnt mean someone else wont.Not sure if you know any cops but I used to rent with a policemans son and his dad would quietly do a search for us when we were checking out rental houses to see how many times each address had been burgled  thats incredibly useful info if you can get it. Obviously good securitys more important for a house than it is for an apartment because there are usually a lot more points of entry and a lot more places to hide.Public transports a good one. If youre near a train tramlines or a highway make sure you know how much sound carries into the house. Its great living near PT but having a bus stop petrol station or similar directly outside of your house can also be a good way to get intimately acquainted with the local vandals.,hOUSES,cesapwv,2,t5_2qu1o
