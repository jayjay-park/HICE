9658649,0,t1_da3fjjn,gtThe problem with your entire argument is quite simple No creator is required to represent anyone they choose not to. Youre totally right but just because theyre not obligated to make them doesnt mean they cant or shouldnt.gt Tau and EldarYou yourself admit the IG dont have female representation the Tau have one female character one of only five female special characters in all of k and one those is straight up dressed in a battle lingerie the Eldar have one set of female models. Thats not really a ton of representation is it?gtYou also neglect to mention anything Sisters related outside their defeats as if they havent had novels and codexes of their own in which they are the victors.There are two novels written about Sisters in which they triump Faith and Fire and Hammer and Anvil. Two. Heres the other references to SoBs I can remember off the top of my head. Daemonfuge one SoB kicks ass but only because shes psychicallyspiritually enhanced by an entire convent of Sisters brutalized and stitched into a living human ball of flesh by a demon. Oh and another Sister in another convent is seduced by a demon and falls to Chaos because SEX. Good show for the Sisters I guess.. Ciaphas Cain yes there are Sisters of Battle in a Cain novel. They all die fighting Tyranids. Badass sure but all dead that too.. The Necrons first codex. What better way to introduce the Necrons than having them wipe out a convent full of Sisters flaying the flesh from their bones with gauss cannons. Not exactly a triumph. . Soul DrinkersRelated short story cool we get one badass Sister and her redshirt sisters who get beat up by Space Marines of both the traitor and neutral variety. In the end the brave Space Marines spare the poor woman and in the short story the Sister doesnt finish off a demon the heroic demonic reformed Space Marine does. Shes still a badass but she sure does get the shit kicked out of her a lot.. The aforementioned Khornate Knights incident. A Space Marine Chapter cannibalizes an entire group of Sisters for breaking sacred rites or some nonsense. Another entire order of Sisters gets turned by Slaneesh. Grey Knights slaughter a bunch of Sisters who get tricked into thinking theyre evil by a wily Chaos championgtLying about things only makes your entire position on the matter all the more laughable.Deliberately ignoring things doesnt help you much either.,ImaginaryWarhammer,da3mplw,3,t5_360vi
