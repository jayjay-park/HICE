474411,0,t1_cftot89,Hey Thanks for asking.I designed stackflow to help speed up locating testing and exploiting remote EIP overwrite buffer overflows.This tool should be able to exploit most remote EIP overwrite exploits. There is a very good Readme file with plenty of examples but the general idea is to have something that can. Communicate with a server send commands receive reply. Fuzz with cyclic pattern.. Calcualte offset from EIP string after fuzzing crash.. Test using calc.exe shellcode.. Generate and exploit using metasploit shellcode.. Export the exploits in a form that can be used in metasploit. rc filesYou should be able to go from fuzzing crash to meterpreter within  minute on any remote EIP overwrite vulnerable software.So to answer your question yes you can find BO with this tool but the key feature of this tool is the ease and speed of exploitation and the integration into metasploit.,blackhat,cfu6yrc,4,t5_2qt2m

765999,0,t1_cgr3vyq,I think its actually the payload called permutation. But I dont know how to use it properly yet with how I want to use it.I found files in the wordlists directory where there is REGEX I assumed it may be available to add a REGEX to a file and use it as a payload. But i dont know if this is correct.,blackhat,cgrcl7p,1,t5_2qt2m

1081996,0,t1_chr8neq,From the Pineapple Bar you can run custom code written in any of five different scripting languages including Python. There are also prebuilt Infusions which are either back end or front end code to add new feature or make the UI easier respectively. Theres an approval process for the officially recognized Infusions.Technically you could do most of the Pineapple commands using software and a WiFi adapter. Ive been meaning to test out setting up a soft AP named attwifi and seeing what devices connect to it. Or going to a place with an open WiFi connection and seeing if I cant broadcast my soft AP over that.Hak had a  minute episode covering the features of the Pineapple Mark . Ive been learning about WiFi encryption so this is just the next natural step in my education.,blackhat,chr9xmn,1,t5_2qt2m
