11117156,0,t1_dernqju,gtIf my mix works fine ingame then whats the problem? The only thing we care about is the result ingame.Youre not getting it. The file works fine in game because its not corrupted. The point here is that Audacity is corrupting the th channel for some users when they create the .ogg file. Any file generated on your end will work because youre not suffering from the glitch some of us do. You save the .ogg and when you open it again the th channel doesnt sound as bad as the one in my example file.gtOr maybe youre just some capcom apologist who thinks the MT frame work is a perfect engine and doesnt have flaws.Theres a higher chance of Audacity being at fault here. Especially when a lot of people do exactly the same steps yet end up with different results.gtEver think that the th channel gets compressed because thats what audacity is supposed to do?No your files dont get their th channel ruined. The game source files dont have the channel ruined either. Audacity is not supposed to do that which is why its not happening on your end. If you grab the .mp I linked to and do all the steps to convert it to .ogg youll end up with a file that can be used while some of us dont.Im not sure if this is related to the operative system people are using.gtYou dont have to agree with my methods but you also dont have to point out every single fallacy in a fucking essay when most of the shit you say has no difference whatsoever on the modding progress for this game. If youre so sure about the Magneto ALT slot not being deleted then prove itSince you brought that up I didnt even remember you were that guy in the other thread Ill biteThe game expects Magneto to be able to select the ALT slot The game also crashes if you force Magneto to use the ALT slot once the character was chosen This is all I was talking about back then and the thing you didnt get after so many posts. We only have two things to fix in order to access this costume slot Change the variable that tells the game that Magnetos costume wasnt bought so we can access it via color scrolling like usual. We should be able to fix that once we find the variable to tweak. Add the assets in the correct places. The game crashes in the second picture because the assets dont exist. These include things like the D model itself and HUD and system related graphics Character select screen portrait next to the lifebar win screen all the VS screens and maybe even the license card where you set up your  preset teams for example.Thats the thing I was talking about thats all. I even just learned how to use cheat engine in this game just to find the variable in charge of the costume selection.gtthis post also bothers me from my perspective you are talking down to someone who worked on a mod because they have computer issuesOr maybe Im telling the person to post a screenshot because his video is super pixelated and the framerate is atrocious? Were reaching extreme nitpicking territory here. Im sure the guy can take the feedback just fine.Im trying to be as nice as possible here but please dont ask me to turn into Barney the Dinosaur especially when I have to point out things that are wrong. I cannot be responsible for people getting their pride hurt over the most minor things.On topic I went to the Audacity forums to see if I can get a reply. In the meantime Ill download an older version and see if the glitch is present there. I also figured out that saving a .flac song with  channels actually keeps the th channel intact but sadly every format converter Ive tried will convert the song to stereo when you change the format to .ogg.,mahvelmods,des4cm0,1,t5_3jere

11142099,0,t1_deuksxu, Kinda but not really. Model editing means editing the current models in the game. Model making means making a new model for the game. Model importing means importing assets from an external source e.g. importing costumes from sf into sfxt.,mahvelmods,deuy20u,2,t5_3jere

11293762,0,t1_dfc41tl,it is yes but the architecture was based on older gen fps on I think the FPS is really GPU driven having a dedicated GPU makes a world of difference.,mahvelmods,dfc4r5w,1,t5_3jere
