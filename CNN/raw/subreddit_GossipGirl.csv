7408216,0,t3_4grzw1,Its also hilarious how every time she starts liking a guy and someone gives her advice she doesnt listen. And then like an episode or  later at the most the advice she was given turns out to be true and she moves on to the next guy. Repeat. She also gets so pissy when she things arent going her way and almost always calls a guy. She has done something like that every time and shes doing it again right now. Nate wants to take things slow and wants to go to a dinner alone and even though he never said she could go with him she gets all whiny and leaves. Followed by calling a guy and asking if she can go to the dinner with him. Knowing Nate will be there. I really dont understand why people give her so many chances. She doesnt deserve any of them if shes never going to learn.,GossipGirl,d2k9l2w,9,t5_2rn7c
7931653,0,t3_4nu8ii,Nate was the only one with a real moral compass. Like come on he was the complete package and yet he was still alone by the time the series ended. He only fucked up when he slept with Serena but after that true golden boy of the whole damn show,GossipGirl,d47lchi,8,t5_2rn7c

9313333,0,t3_572gwn,Id have to say my most hated was Jenny until I watched it again. My new one is Dr van der Woodson for constantly breaking up Rufus and Lilly. I thought they were an awesome couple and Rufus definitely doesnt deserve that. Jenny might have caused a few problems but William created permanent ones. ,GossipGirl,d8wj7pm,3,t5_2rn7c
9437436,0,t1_d9ai78l,Not at all. Its a completely different story. ,GossipGirl,d9c9ez4,1,t5_2rn7c
9743067,0,t3_517lpi,Yes there was also reports about her being disliked on set acting like she was too good forover it since she was then this rockstar who took herself to serious to be on a girly shallow show like Gossip Girl. ,GossipGirl,dae1n0v,2,t5_2rn7c
10940467,0,t3_5w8xvq,I love the ending so much! Mostly for seeing Blair and Chuck ruling and how welldressed their son is. I love also the drama after Barts death and the rushed wedding. Dont care at all about Dan and Serena but do like seeing Nate as a young politico. I used to watch the show with my boyfriend and we called Nate and Serena the golden retrievers sweet but inbred and unintelligent. Glad Nate at least developed a bit. ,GossipGirl,de8fkhq,12,t5_2rn7c

11671793,0,t3_6535w9,I totally get you on the Brittany Snow part!  I mean Alison and Jenny have similarities but Dan and Rufus are not at all similar. Also the captain and nate nope.,GossipGirl,dgj0i96,2,t5_2rn7c
