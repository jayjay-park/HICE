9423957,0,t3_59qiud,One thing I noticed recently is that the information out there on the internet with regards to Birch Rings is flawed. The cost tends to be overestimated by about  orders of magnitude trillions instead of billions of dollars and nobody has apparently even attempted to rule out a small scale version on the order of  tons or so.Birch himself proposed Orbital Rings II part . a bootstrap ORS costing a billion dollars or so and massing  tons. Thats likely a bit overoptimistic as its  or so times as massive as the ISS. Modern readers circa  should be thinking in terms of much smaller and less expensive bootstrap launch systems.Another thing worth mentioning is that much as Dyson spheres shouldnt be solid shells Birch Rings probably shouldnt involve a continuous wire for their ballast. Its just not a great design. You can look at computer simulations showing that they tend to break apart with mild perturbations.Still using a swarm of cloud of ballast is something well worth considering. Especially today since small sized satellites are starting to be a big thing now. You could in principle have a hundred tons of gram sized satellites with built in propulsion and on board computer tech or radio electronics to make use of external computers to keep their hyperorbital path precisely aligned with the stationary components.Such a cloud would weigh  tons easily enough to keep a  ton stationary satellite from falling out of the sky while remaining reasonably close to circular path and the components could be spaced less than a meter apart form each other in low earth orbit.,IsaacArthur,d9ajv47,2,t5_3g7ux
