7045270,0,t1_d1eudei,Haha nice guesses! Heres a little help in case you want it.None of these flairs are either currently available or in use by mods. So if you see a mod sporting a character as their flair that character probably wont be unlockable unless the mod themself releases it for the rest of the sub to use. So Wolverine isnt one and neither is Capatain America since hes already out for use.Some of the wording in the hints are purposely emphasised to help guessers chances of figuring things out but most will likely only be discovere when theyre revealed the first time on accident. Others are tied to contests and events well be holding sometime soon. Heimdall is actualy a really neat guess for the watchful flair! Id suggest trying something a tiny bit more literal aong the same lines to get the real answer if you really want to go for it. Thanks for being so interested!,MarvelFanfiction,d1extou,1,t5_3ccp1
7047551,0,t1_d1ey3iy,I guess the same could be said to me but Im more of a first come first serve kind of guy if the first pairing Ive read about in the fandom was say TonyLoki and its wellwritten Id latch into that pairing and just... wouldnt stick with other alternatives. I agree with you.. it takes a special kind of strength and inhumane patience and inner goodness to be with Loki... and this translates to a very onesided relationship almost all the time. because most of the time what I see is the other party is giving Loki a chance because they pity him... but maybe because I havent found a good story yet Im all for Loki pairings but I think he really needs to deal with his own issues by himself or at least with nonromantic relationships like trying to come to grounds with Thor or with his parents etc because I think while he can be better because hes in a romantic relationship with someone its idealistic to think that it could fix all his issues and make him whole. There needs to be more gen fics about Loki or Thor and him being brothers.I see the appeal of Stony but personally Im more of a Stucky guy. Science bros are always a treat and Natasha... is too complex of a character and history to be paired with anyone imo tho! I havent watched season  of AoS. But yeah there are so many shipping potential going on there...,MarvelFanfiction,d1f74mg,1,t5_3ccp1
