1604696,0,t1_cjhfi81,Well thats awesome. I guess the real question is who would I go through to even try to get a job? I dont know if I would have to go through the carrier or the equipment manufacturer or some other type of contractor. Ive tried searching but I guess I dont even know the names of positions that I want to apply for. Thanks for the response. ,telecom,cjhfurp,1,t5_2qhm8

You can put protection on the lines for storms and such to help protect yourself.,telecom,ckr7qwj,4,t5_2qhm8

5218142,0,t1_cveon5n,No one is running copper plant anymore unless they absolutely have to.  Even on the long distance runs into the country its more reliablecheaper to either put the subscriber on wireless or drop a fiber mix and deliver services.  The vast majority of copper plant is degrading its anywhere from  years old in places and it just cant get enough bandwidth to service customers. The only saving grace for copper pairs will be that most businesses are migrating to Ethernet from T services. ,telecom,cvez8fu,1,t5_2qhm8
