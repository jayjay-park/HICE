232844,0,t3_1ws2gu,Ok  this might be one of the most confusing things about IBR so bear with me.  Dont leave IBR  and by leave I mean dont notify the servicer you want to change to a standard repayment plan.  Doing so will put you in whats called expedited standard  which will likely give you an extremely high payment.  By simply not renewing  i.e. sending in your income documentation next time they ask for it  they will put you in whats called  wait for it  the standard standard repayment amount which is what your payment amount would be under a ten year plan starting that month.  In both scenarios any outstanding interest you have will capitalize  theres really no way to avoid that frankly other than to make payments before hand to ensure there isnt any to cap.  You can do EFT and pay extra  youll just have to send a check for the nd payment or maybe pay online and specify that you do NOT want the extra funds used to pay you ahead.  If you dont do that your eft payment wont come out the following month because it wont show you due for a payment.,StudentLoans,cf4vsz9,1,t5_2ror6

Furthermore any flexible repayment or forgiveness options will be based on the parent borrowers ability to pay not yours.With that in mind it is fairly common for students to help pay back some or all of their parents PPLs since they are the ones benefiting from the loans... but this is something that should have been discussed before they took out the loans. Was there ever a discussion about who would be pay back these loans? If not would you ever consider working out some sort of agreement where you split the cost of the loans?Oh also Since the Parent PLUS loans are not in your name they will never appear on your credit report regardless of whether or not you agree to help pay them back.

First of all Im sorry to hear about your condition but I wish you the best of luck with your wedding!As others have mentioned assuming your loans are federal and not private you have a pretty good chance of qualifying for a Total and Permanent Disability Claim www.disabilitydischarge.com. All you need is your medical doctor to certify these three things The disability is PERMANENT and not expected to simply go away at any point in the future. The disability was diagnosed AFTER the loans were taken out sounds like it was March  The disability PREVENTS you from being able to work and earn an income this sounds correct in your case since you are claimed as a dependentYou dont necessarily have to file for Disability income assistance in your state but its not a bad idea if it will bring in a bit of extra money for your family. If the Total and Permanent Disability claim is accepted all of your federal loans will be forgiven. If thats the full K then all your debt would be gone.If you do decide to go this route and something changes just know that returning to work will cause the loans to come back. Id recommend talking to your doctor about helping you file the claim and then enjoying retirement with your kids.Good luck!,StudentLoans,cnu6b6w,1,t5_2ror6

So I see it as a sort of equalization of the income redistribution policies of the th century really.  Also student loan debt is basically a tax on your inflated self esteem.  So you think that at the age of  you are so special that you should shackle your future self with enormous debt so that you can go to college now instead of getting a job...  Well good luck kid.  Student loans are certainly a swindle.  They should be drastically reduced.

3190229,0,t3_2wo8zf,This is a good question. The answer is It depends.Scenario  Your income increases but you stay on IBR.You cant get kicked out of IBR for earning too much money so if you go to renew the plan and your income is too high for partial financial hardship your payments will max out at the equivalent of the standard payments you would have had when you started repayment. In this scenario it should take you less than  years to finish paying everything off... but the exact length of repayment would depend on how much progress you already made.Scenario  You formally leave IBR and switch to the Standard Plan.On the IBR application it says If you leave the IBR plan your payment amount will be the standard payment amount calculated based on the outstanding balance of your eligible loans atthe time you leave the IBR plan and the repayment period remaining for your loans. My interpretation of this is if you already spent  years in repayment formally switching from IBR to the Standard Plan should pay everything off in  more years. With that in mind your monthly payments would probably have to be pretty high to compensate for the reduced payments you were making while on IBR... so depending on your income this may or may not be affordable.Scenario  You consolidate and choose the Standard Plan.If for whatever reason you decided to consolidate your way out of IBR you would have to start from scratch on the year plan since consolidation creates an entirely new loan.Note There are no prepayment penalties on student loans so you really dont have to switch to the Standard Plan to pay off your loans in  years or less. You can just pay extra every month... preferably towards the loans with the highest interest rate.,StudentLoans,coso0vh,6,t5_2ror6

3952196,0,t3_35q1lh,There is a lot of helpful info on the sidebar. Regarding your specific situation Try to avoid accruing credit card debt during medical school. This is especially important during the summer before and during the first half of th year when you will be interviewing at dozens of residencies. Please please please budget for this period of time during all four years. Do not charge those travel expenses. That is easily several thousand in debt that you will save yourself from.  As lsp said focusing on the highest interest rate regardless of balance is the best strategy for paying off all loans.  Since you are doing instate med school youll have less debt that many residents but it will still be a substantial amount unless you have some sort of family patron helping you out. Your tuition and fees are fixed but your living expenses are not. There is a saying Live like a doctor while a student live like a student while a doctor. Get one or several roommates. Utilize room renting services for away rotations or look for the rare unicorn of away rotations with housing. Do not party in the bars after every exam. Live frugally. Your medical school will award you significantly more for living expenses than you need to survive. Make a budget and only take the minimum that you need. Be sure to allow for health emergencies and the previously mentioned expenses of interviewing.  If you even have extra cash like an inheritance or large gift do not invest. At this stage in your life your return on an investment will likely be less than a return on paying down a loan or taking less money for your next loan. Youll have ample time and capital to invest soon.  This is a bit away since you havent started first year but be sure to stay on top of your paperwork once you start residency. This includes applying for payment plans PSLF paper work setting up auto payments assuming an interest reduction is still a benefit. Every little payment helps. Every little additional payment helps. TLDR Med school and residency  a long road until you can really pay off debt. Have the mindset that you are poor. Be frugal. You will be fine. Edit grammar,StudentLoans,cr6s8l8,2,t5_2ror6

If you need one to move up in a company that youre established in or you simply need the business acumen to do your job or run your own business better then getting a k MBA is totally worth it as you are relying on your own skills for work and not the weight of the reputation of the university.If you are going to change careers like I did going to a wellknown university is critical.  Not just because of the schools reputation but because recruiters from Fortune  companies come to campus every week to try to convince students to work for them.  They actually fight to see who can get onto campus earlier.I ended up leaving my kyr job getting my MBA and now working at a Fortune  company making k  its a totally different world.Finances  Youd be surprised that despite the high price tag that there are a ton of financial aid options.  While you wont find any scholarships universities offer fellowships.  There are a ton to try to get women into business schools  theres a huge push to rectify the  gender disparity.  Otherwise youll be able to get several unsubsidized loans without much of an issue.  Other people in this thread have covered that already.

Thats why I recommend only having minimum payments as automatic and paying the rest manually whenever you feel comfortable. The . interest rate drop from automatic payments is too insignificant to matter.If you have multiple separate accounts not consolidated I recommend paying off a huge chunk of one of them at a time.

7988939,0,t3_4ok9z0,Sorry to hear about your moms passing. If the loan was in your moms name you are not legally responsible for it. Whether your dad is legally obligated to pay it back depends on whether he actually cosigned for it and the intestacy and marital property laws in the state where your parents live. A lot of creditors will mislead the surviving spouse to believe he or she needs to pay for debts that in fact died with the spouse. As a first step you should check with your dad to make sure he did in fact cosign for the loan. If hes not sure he needs to ask Discover to provide documentation that he did in fact cosign for it. If he did in fact cosign for the loan hes stuck with it and will have to make his best efforts to pay it off under the current terms andor try to get Discover to work with him to figure out a more manageable repayment plan which they are not obligated to do unless the terms actually provide for some kind of forbearancelike relief.,StudentLoans,d4e17fj,1,t5_2ror6

At BEST you are paying money that you dont have to pay for a free service.Contact the people who already have your loan its probably a collection agency and ask for rehabilitation. You do not need to pay to get into this program.Under rehabilitation you make  monthly payments to the collection agency and then your loan gets fixed up like new and returned to a normal status with a normal billing company. There is no enrollment fee for this. Theres a form to fill out but you dont need to pay anyone to fill it out for you.

Everyone pays an extra  percent in taxes each year but it is used to fund the education of the students currently in school. That way school is free as long as you graduate if you dont graduate it becomes a loan with the agreement that you will pay a little higher tax after school to help people younger go to school for free just like you did.

11022248,0,t3_5xcdx3,Youre not paying for the school to issue you a degree. That degree if you went to a public university is accredited by a national program. If it was say engineering it would be accredited by ABET. These accrediting organizations exist to ensure that anyone who possesses a degree accredited by them understands and knows various core concepts and ideas. Professors must set up their classes in accordance with these standards. In order to issue you a degree you must score high enough for an accrediting organization to accept that you understand said core concepts and ideas. If they let anyone through the degree becomes worthless and nothing more than a very expensive slip of paper. Compare popular liberal arts degrees like philosophy which have very little accreditation to heavily monitored and accredited degrees like engineering degrees.The situation you describe is part of adult life. Yes they are concerned about busy work and attendance. So is the real world. As a guy who works to feed a family and goes to college so he can make more in the future my employer maintains a  attendance policy. If you miss more than  of work days in a year youre terminated with no questions asked. From time to time I must do obnoxious HR paperwork. Notetaking I dont have to do much but notetaking is an essential study tool. You really shouldnt skimp on the notes when learning new concepts.You talk of how you would have just gone to trade school but I get this feeling that your problems would have persisted. Never minding the fact that trade school is often just as expensive two years of welding school will run you a cool k depending on location and prestige it honestly just sounds like youd be the sort of guy to sleep through his welding drills and then come in to do his certification test not pass and then complain to the inspector about how nice your beads look. If youre not going do busywork which is often how people refer to tedious but essential homework or take notes or even show up for class what do you expect to do? You say you aced your tests but if your GPA is that low Im kinda wondering how that could be. Often times homework is a very small portion of the grade at most . If attendance counts for another  you should have at least been scraping by with Cs if you just simply never touched a single homework or attended a day of class. I note that you say you showed up to class every day eager to learn and then complain about attendance being highly ranked. If you showed up every day why is this a complaint? You were there doing it and if you were eager that doesnt sound like you dreading having to go in every day and wanting to be somewhere else.You were deemed unworthy of the degree because the university is contractually and in some cases legally bound to follow accreditation standards. You dont mention your degree so going off of what I know engineering the state has a vested interest in its engineers knowing what theyre doing. You must do well in school and get the accredited degree to become a licensed engineer in most of the US. Presumably this is because we dont want our bridges to be built by people who felt taking notes was problematic.I dont say any of this with the intent of malice or ill will Im just kinda genuinely baffled by all of this. You seem to be under the impression that you pay money and in return you are guaranteed a degree unless you yourself decide to go away from it. This is not the case. You are paying for a service that gives you the means and information to obtain what essentially is a certificate saying that you have met certain standards and that you can be relied upon to meet those standards again in the future. This is the case for all wellpaying jobs that can be obtained without the help of sheer luck or familyplacement. Companies and governments dont want to take risks with their money so for positions where a lot is on the line they put in place requirements and the university system and their accrediting bodies reflect that. If you go to trade school youll find exactly the same thing.In the comments you mention you are a director of sales. This sounds like a good position and I hope it pays well enough to help with your new debts. A director level position should at least have a decent salary. Id encourage going to a cheaper community college and pursuing an associates that would help your grades and your career path if sales is something you want to stay in. Having done my time in sales before it is an industry you may be a fit for.TLDR The university is held to certain standards by businesses and the government. You have to meet those standards. You did not you went through the appeals process and it was determined you still did not. You borrowed money to come to this conclusion and it is now your responsibility to pay that money back because you agreed to it.
