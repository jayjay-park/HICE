You should NOT have to spend  for a pad to have at home. I believe you can buy a nice hard foam pad for  but I will need to look around to find a link to one My down arrow is sort of broken anyways so I am interested in finding a new one!Edit Ive been looking all over and it appears that the foam pad industry is doomed unless you place some wood paneling under the pad or something....,Stepmania,cqtd0ca,2,t5_2s2wx

4679391,0,t1_ct4ikb3,is that a soft pad?  I am just trying to get in to this game and probably want to play it more or less the way you do but I was getting an impression that the soft pads wont hold up very long with regular use especially for bigger guys.  Have you done anything to modify your pad?  What difficulty do you mostly play on?,Stepmania,ctkdv8q,1,t5_2s2wx
4884730,0,t1_cua98d4,Go for the ones that are designed for Pads as in dance pads. They are much less complex and easier to get into and you can work your way up from there that is if you play with your keyboard!

6828746,0,t3_499i7o,Let me save you a lot of money and trouble. I was in the exact same position as you. Well my pad was an official Konami Xbox pad but the Red Octane is more or less just a fancy xbox pad.Anyhow..You have to buy a new pad. Im so sorry. I loved my pad too. I tried EVERYTHING to get it to work. There are no workarounds. Microsoft simply doesnt support those drivers anymore.If you really like playing Stepmania I would just go for it and buy an Omega GX Its expensive and its a hard pad not metal theres a difference but it requires no maintenance and it functions flawlessly right out of the box.I dicked around with other pads. You may feel tempted to try the soft pad from Dancepad Mania. Dont. They suck. Mine lasted a week before it stopped working and they never responded to my customer support ticket. Precision Dance Pads Omega GX is really the only quality nonarcade setup being produced these days. If you have the cash go for it.,Stepmania,d0qc742,4,t5_2s2wx
