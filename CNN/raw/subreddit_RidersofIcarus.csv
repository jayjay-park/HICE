8252262,0,t3_4sgmq4,hmm i had h of playtime on my berserker when i reached lv. All i did was to do the main story with all the side questsas it was my nd toon i already knew what to do and did them fast but i also had a slight help from my friends when doing some questskill bosses tougher enemies story dungeons etc.. Dont know if there is a faster way than just doing all quests fast,RidersofIcarus,d59370u,1,t5_3brut
8255848,0,t1_d59ib5g,Ah okay I saw a few comment around talents and Lv so I thought it was a level unlocked feature...guess I should stop soloing elites and heroics for a bit. XD,RidersofIcarus,d59jd5h,1,t5_3brut

8365120,0,t3_4u5q8v,When I crashed on entering places I switched characters jumped in place a few times and then switched back and it was fixed. Since doing that the errors stopped.    I googled it once and there was a shader file or directory people deleted and supposedly that fixed it for them.,RidersofIcarus,d5n6wft,1,t5_3brut
8408935,0,t3_4ut9nd,Look at Hakains Grasp and the skills you can use after.  Youll get some AoE aggro grabbers knockback and damage depending on what you use.Rising Truth and Dominant Virtue will slash more than one target if theyre in front of you.,RidersofIcarus,d5snui4,1,t5_3brut

8517442,0,t3_4wbte4,This one is a good starting point. Some things to note are that you need to manage your buffs pretty closely. Surging Light and Dark Ecstasy are your friends. Surging light will increase your DPS and Dark Ecstasy will allow you to regen healthmana. Good wizards know how to switch between them through out the fight. ,RidersofIcarus,d668nrl,1,t5_3brut
8527624,0,t3_4wg8fn,The new version of logash Reindeer elite is Int . magic attack and will power . crit. TBH with Crit Cap being easy to hit off neck and gear he is the best choice. It is kind of a tie for IntCrit damage once you hit  Crit so either go for Blue Bloodwyrms and only a few items of Crit Gear  prices with  Crit or go for more Crit gear and the Elite Reindeer.Also HP is a bad stat. Between mana shield and our frost thing that ups resistances we are fine in dungeons. I run FK HV with .k health.Unless you pull threat faster than your second mana shield cd nothing should touch your hp. If you are getting hit in dungeons you are doing something wrong.,RidersofIcarus,d67ils3,1,t5_3brut
8539908,0,t1_d68zy3n,I would take that to mean do not discuss how to hack or where to get hacks from. That  is far different than posting screenshots of someone ruining the game.,RidersofIcarus,d6921gz,4,t5_3brut
