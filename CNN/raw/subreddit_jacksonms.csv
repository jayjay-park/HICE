326319,0,t1_cfcxzlh,this is a great summary to jackson food i completely agree with everything you said. i have a couple additions.for indian food i like ruchi its hard to say which is better but ruchi has better naan and has a nice kick of spicy to it. its located down county line road close to old canton rd.another place in highland village is crazy cat bakery. they have great sandwiches and my mouth is watering just thinking about their desserts.The Manship Restaurant in the new medical building right next to keifers is amazing. i dont remember what all they had but i had a wonderful burger. i had a bite of everyones food and it was all great.if your ever out in clinton you should stop by froghead grill they have a wide variety of food and i can rarely finish everything on my plate. thats where i had lunch today.another buffet to add to the list is mama hamils out in ridgeland. its quite cheap for all the food they have to offer.there are so many great places to eat.,jacksonms,cfeldl2,1,t5_2skgq

933190,0,t1_chacezn,I second this. When I first decided to move to this area Jackson wasnt even an option. I live in Brandon and could not be happier. I dont mind the  minute drive to get to work but I know I can sleep better at night. Also taxes are higher in Hinds County. I know a lot of people suggest Fondren or Belhaven area but they have a lot of breakins and stolen stuff. I have a few friends who live in those areas and all  of them have had something happen to their apartment or vehicles. Just my opinion. ,jacksonms,chacwzc,4,t5_2skgq

1110678,0,t1_cghfeuy,You definitely should look more in the Ridgeland and Madison area. Just past Madison on the way towards Canton theres some great subdivisions. My SOs parents used to live in one off of Gluckstadt Road. Great neighborhood houses a bit cookie cutter sure but nice and affordable. Stay away from Pearl and Brandon. I havent come across a single nice person who lives in either of those towns since Ive moved here.  Flowood isnt too bad though. But there is a definite wrong side of the tracks aspect to some parts of Jackson. But there are some great things about the area too that more than make up for it. Good luck!! ,jacksonms,chujj8y,2,t5_2skgq

5087694,0,t3_3koggz,There is a new play and trade next to north park mall.  Your best bet is going to be to go to the flea market in Flowood.  There is a guy there named Michael who has a large game store.  His prices are based on eBay though.  I used to be able to get really good deals there got splatterhouse  and punisher for Genesis for  each.  Now he looks up prices on the spot.  Still worth going.  ,jacksonms,cuz9cyc,3,t5_2skgq
