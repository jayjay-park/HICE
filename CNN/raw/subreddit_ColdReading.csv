Due to an injury I  very rarely use cards anymore However before  I preform a routine I normally do what I was advised and thats be honest as in admit that what I do is just pure trickery what people take from it is not my fault.And always remember its the effect you are creating and to make it the best takes good  presentation. My goal is try make people question life by giving them a taste of pure magic even if its for a moment. And I Never ever give away the secrets!! As that takes the magic away from the spectator You will only make yourself out to look like a smart ass and the spectator feel like a foolNot good for either of you.
