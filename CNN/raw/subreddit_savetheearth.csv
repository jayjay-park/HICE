1865386,0,t3_2fymlu,If you connect then your internet goes out you still can play as if nothing had happened. We lost internet several times in the last month and Ive been able to play throughout so long as I dont close the game.I can still save export import etc I just cant gain any additional updates or changes.If you mean close the game entirely then continue to generate resources I doubt it. This game is a semi idle incremental its purpose is to keep players actively playing as much as possible. The creatordev that often posts here has said that he does not want to push the game into a full idle stance at any point.This is why the supply crates alien carrier and speedster are supposed to be powerful so you keep playing to get the next one.,savetheearth,ckdz1yc,1,t5_32dyu
1865892,0,t1_cke03nx,We are  guys Zaloran and I. We both code and do sprites and we plan everything together. Basically we work as one. So Im definitely reliable xD. I can assure you the new ship will be implented soon enough the sprite is already done I just dont want to say tomorrow because shit happens.,savetheearth,cke18wn,1,t5_32dyu

2489003,0,t1_cmjdqaq,The fifth page will have a whole line of conversion with extra bonuses so its better than just a max button. A max button is another thing that will come but the new researches will make a difference between max and new conversors.This problem with the numbers was urgent since all of your saves could get broken and beyond repair. Relax guys we dont have that much time but everything will come.,savetheearth,cmjg8uo,3,t5_32dyu
2510128,0,t3_2odsd1,You have to complete each portal to unlock the next on the next reset.There are money portals and exp portals. Money portals are generally better because the money they give is real money that builds your passive bonusThe exp portals are different because they give access to crazy amounts of RP and GP that is turned into lots of empty money that does NOT build your passive bonus.Also you have to complete each previous money or exp portal to unlock the next on your next reset and each subsequent one is a little stronger.,savetheearth,cmm7n49,1,t5_32dyu
4465169,0,t3_3c6lrv,As far as I am aware this is the current version and wont be updated anytime in the near future.  The game is very much still worth playing. Plenty of ranks to go through. ,savetheearth,cstig5c,1,t5_32dyu
