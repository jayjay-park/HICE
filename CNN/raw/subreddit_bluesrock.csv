150422,0,t3_1vt3ck,Really liked the album. I saw him twice on the tour with Hacienda supporting. Great live show check out the covers of Rockinghorses Oh Carol The Animals Outside Looking In and the cover of Link Wrays cover of Hidden Charms. I enjoyed these more than most of the originals.,bluesrock,cevkbb6,3,t5_2sy9f
451946,0,t3_1z7zro,I really like the Trio stuff and I find it funny how a lot of people are just unaware of his stuff in the blues. But this strikes me more as Jazz than anything else. ,bluesrock,cfrmv5k,2,t5_2sy9f

726039,0,t3_22de7x,So I have some questions for the community What Led Zepplin songs would you include? What TBK songs should NOT be included? What songs if any should be added from The British Invasion  What Gary Clark Jr. songs should be added?  How do you guys feel about Wolfmother? Ive always mentally kind of lumped them in but thats me.,bluesrock,cgmsyrm,1,t5_2sy9f
