4926686,0,t3_3fbtl0,I had a hysterectomy when I was .  Id complained about super painful periods for YEARS but the nurse practitioner I saw would just tell me that my Mirena IUD was supposed to prevent endometriosis so it just couldnt be that.  November  during my routine gyn exam she was doing the part of the exam where they feel your ovaries... and her facial expression said it all... she proceeded to tell me that I had something on my ovary that felt like she was rubbing her fingers over knuckles ew and she set me up to speak to the gynecologist for a ultrasound and to discuss my options and whatnot.Seeing how this visit I was going to ask about other birth control other than IUD and the fact that I didnt want children the gynsurgeon gave me the option to have a hysterectomy but keep my ovaries and cervix.  In my head I thought it would be a lifechanger... no periods or cramps less fatigue etc.  I also hurried the surgery along so I could benefit from meeting my deductible earlier in the year.  The surgery was a few days after Christmas . Afterwards the surgeon told me my endo was BAD.  He actually called it wicked.  Haha.  But he was straight with me and said one ovary had to be removed.  And I would most likely need another surgery in about  years. So I accepted that.Fast forward  year later.  Im getting periods and bleeding badly... and Im freaking out I understood Id have a cycle but WTF am I bleeding from? So I see the surgeon and he says the endo is on my cervix now and bleeding just like endometrial tissue would.  So he chemically cauterizes it and says that should help.  It didnt.  He said I could have another surgery to clean me out and remove my cervix... but Im not prepared financially to pay for that or deal with the time off work.Ive been bleeding monthly ever since and it feels just like a period from before... painful cramps sore boobs pms achy body crazy fatigue...  the pain has gotten worse.  Ive only had sex with my bf once since my surgery  Im either too physically uncomfortable or just in too much pain to even think about being intimate plus Im scared its going to hurt or make things worse.  Ive also noticed that working out seems to aggravate whatever is going on inside Ill get crampy and sore in my abdominal area a day or two after a good workout.  Its obvious I need another surgery but Im not in the position to be able to right now or anytime soon.  Im extremely discouraged.I found this subreddit after I was googling if this was common so soon after a surgery when I was told it would be more like  years.  Guess Ill stick to my ibuprofen and bitching heheh until I can have another surgery.,endometriosis,cufjq8f,1,t5_2z46j
5687733,0,t1_cx1xtia,How do you deal with this? Very good question! Snap my ovaries like to stick to things too Wow I am really shocked your dr is not concerned about going back to work! In the UK they say minimum of two weeks to a month off work after surgery. It sounds like we had very similar ops I too had ovaries covered in scar tissue and I took  weeks off work I have an office job! So no where near as demanding as a nurse. I find having people around you who support you and are fully aware of the situation and how you feel helps. It will take a while to digest this information be patient with yourself if you can! ,endometriosis,cx249ya,1,t5_2z46j
5756501,0,t1_cxal49p,Im actually pretty excited. Aside from the ovarian cysts that seem to mostly stay on the left most of my pain is in the uterus. I have adopted one child and an adopting another and have never wanted to be pregnant so I dont have to worry about that. Thank you for your concern! ,endometriosis,cxand3h,1,t5_2z46j
6056442,0,t1_cydei68,What a pain! I know with OBGYNs in my area you can just book and come in. I see one for nonpregnancy related issues. Maybe see what resources are online? You seem like youre off to a good start by cutting out unhealthy food.  Take it easy!,endometriosis,cydhwu6,1,t5_2z46j
6445632,0,t3_43wbb5,I am so so sorry. Honestly. Endo is bad enough with out the insanity you are going through. It seems like your going from one clueless horrid doctor to the next. I highly suggest you find the extremely active Facebook pages available and share your story youll receive lots of help.My experience with endo was I went In said my symptoms was told it was likely endo but we were going to do some blood work and a check up to rule everything else out stds pregnancy etc. Then we did an ultrasound but I was told before hand this likely would no show any endo because its almost never picked up. So then I had the surgery my doctor cut out a lot of endo and when I woke up he told me I was likely a stage  it would be a few weeks before lab results were back but to rest and take it easy. I was given pain pills and I was in some pretty bad pain for a few days and bloated for over a week. After that at my post op he prescribed me new birth control nausea meds and pain pills. He also gave me stuff for depression and anxiety because with the pain and the birth control I was just going crazy.You really should see a specialist or at least someone with more experience with endo. Lime I said endo sucks enough without the hell you are living through. Search Facebook and find all the groups with high amounts of members and reach out to your endo sisters. They might be able to answer your specific questions that I couldnt.Hugs,endometriosis,czm0ofa,1,t5_2z46j
7196684,0,t1_d1w5lmi,thank you! im new to all the subreddits to ill ask some questions on there too,endometriosis,d1w7d2s,2,t5_2z46j
7531180,0,t1_d2xuqgp,Youre very welcome. I can relate I suffer from anxiety as well and take medication to help. You mentioned you have a therapy dog do you find that helps you? Ive been interested in looking into a therapy pet maybe. I hope your surgery goes well and that you have a speedy recovery ,endometriosis,d2y9bcz,1,t5_2z46j
8278499,0,t1_d5cc8pu,I know how you feel. Getting this diagnosis has made me feel more alone than I ever have. If you ever need a sympathetic ear send me a PM.,endometriosis,d5cddbu,2,t5_2z46j
10057348,0,t3_5jn63e,Yes!!! The pain starts during ovulation then stays there until my period finishes. So I go about a week and a half every cycle with no pain. Every. Damn. Month.  ,endometriosis,dbihwcs,2,t5_2z46j
10173353,0,t1_dbwncto,Thank you so much for your post. So much valuable information there. I really appreciate you taking your time to write all this. I hope youre feeling OK today! Dont forget to say thanks to your husband as well. From the internet guy! D,endometriosis,dbx7eyk,1,t5_2z46j
10844901,0,t1_ddy3hpj,I feel you on that one girl. I might try some snake blood at this point. Its hard DAMN hard for women with this and I wouldnt wish it on anyone.I read an article on reddit a while back about a woman whos trying to make bigger strides in finding more about endo and treating it and I was just so happy that doctors are shining more a light on it FINALLY. ,endometriosis,ddykq20,1,t5_2z46j
11274636,0,t3_60wvn8,The only way to diagnose it is to do the surgery. birth control only does so much. IMO I would insist on the surgery so you can know if you have it or not then go from there. ,endometriosis,df9yp7k,1,t5_2z46j
11498125,0,t3_63ytab,You sound so much like me. Ive always had bad periods and they got progressively worse until I sought help at . Ive been on the pill and using prescription NSAIDS for about  years. Ultrasounds and colonoscopy showed nothing. I was having all of your symptoms plus a lot of infections. Sex was super painful. My obgyn never wanted to use the word endo and Ive still never had a laparoscopy.I ended up getting something called Premarin for the sex pain...this was more for the fact that repeated infections left me with scarring. Afterwards the doctor changed me to taking my birth control  packs back to back. My periods still suck but I dont have the pain symptoms outside of my period. Ive still never been officially diagnosed but I have a treatment that is helping. Doctors are also usually pretty chill about the pill and the one I use is only  for a three month supply.,endometriosis,dfzb8y0,2,t5_2z46j
11752497,0,t1_dgs5yq7,Same. I take continuous microgestin and so long as I take multiple packs back to back Im generally fine. Its just if I accidentally miss a dose or get my period that things get bad,endometriosis,dgs6b7q,1,t5_2z46j
