4880335,0,t3_3h73fd,Last week I was on holiday so that was pretty fun. Did next to nothing productive which maybe isnt so good.I received my GCSE results today and did fairly well I got into the college I want to go to so thats a plus. However with my maths grade they said I will have to work very hard to get a good AS maths result. Thats my goal for this upcoming week and probably the ones following that. I will have to study hard if I want to get into uni to do computer science!,KaizenBrotherhood,cu9pckf,1,t5_35afn
5002965,0,t3_3jg1yy,When it comes to writing dont worry about how it will look like in the end. Writing is a very interesting process and just like you said sometimes it feels like its not us who wrote it. Thats because we are accessing our deepest sometimes unknown thoughts through writing and its also why journaling is so beneficial. gtHowever with all these negative thoughts I get its a struggle.It is. But you have to continue despite of those negative thoughts. Its hard to believe but those thoughts will dissapear over time. It might take monthsyears but it will happen. Its also important that you dont get overconfident. Failure is inevitable. Always keep that in mind. We are humans we can never know everything and naturally we will fail when doing something new. And its through failure that we learn and grow. But its up to us will we see failure as an obstacle or make the obstacle the way by learning from our failures and going on. I suggest you look into the book The obstacle is the way.gtI have also learned recently that is hard to break bad habits and hard to start good ones.You see those negative thoughts are not your true self and you can realize that by comparing them with your writing. There is a potential in you to achieve great things you just have to work on aligning your thoughts with reality and transform in the person you already are deep inside. This is done by manifesting your thoughts despite of obstacles. Over time you will become more and more like your vision.,KaizenBrotherhood,cup1mpx,2,t5_35afn

5237045,0,t3_3mpu6a,I hope to become better aware of my thoughts  emotions and impulses so when I am anxious I can realise that its just my thoughts that are making me anxious.  To realise that when I want to procrastinate I realise that I am just avoiding work because I am scared of failing and doing something else take my mind off.  To realise that when I feel that everything is meaningless that I am just  rationalising something that should have no effect on my enjoyment of life. I want to live the moment instead of living the future or the past so that I can live instead of just going by  afraid of the future or ashamed of the past. ,KaizenBrotherhood,cvh95in,1,t5_35afn
5839933,0,t3_3tuoii,Have a location that you go to for each activity of your day and even an outfit. I plan to get an outfit just for meditation and go to the nearby park just for meditation and I think that will make it far easier to make it routine and just part of my schedule rather than something extra or unnecessary.,KaizenBrotherhood,cxl54li,1,t5_35afn

6585172,0,t3_45t90b,Join a sub like rloseit  ask those who have have more expertise.Based on the basics of body mechanics heres what itll come down toWeight loss is  diet  exercise. Depending on your height and metabolism your best bet will be to reduce your calorie intake to  per day. Spread your meals out throughout the day . Get ideas from here risplenty Hydrate hydrate hydrate spread your drinking out throughout the day  liters of water. Drink before you eat your meals. Green tea flushes out your system and cleans up your system. Drink  cups of tea a day Green tea is steeped a maximum of  minutes so if its bitter youre steeping it too long and killing off some of the beneficial antioxidants.Because youll be reducing calories make sure the foods you are eating are nutrient rich. A few fruits vegetables lean proteins like poultry and fish. If you have access to protein powders great. The goal is to cut all refined sugar zero soda or sugary juices and boost fiber intake leafy greens.Work out wise you dont need to do anything crazy. Bodyweight exercises should be sufficient you can learn more at rbodyweightfitnessGood look brother! ,KaizenBrotherhood,d00glpe,3,t5_35afn

8702113,0,t1_d6pnmx0,gtIm ready to shed this bullshit story Ive given myself. I dont know what the new story is going to be yet but I know I have to throw this one in the trash.And right here youve given the narrative power. Youre framing it as it controlling you and it being whats holding yourself back. gtI have to throw this one in the trashRight here is where its clear. You see it as a negative thing thats a part of your life instead of something that you do.If I punch myself should I get mad at my fist? Go Eugh! You stupid multiple appendage limb! Ill get you!...well...I dont do that......not anymore....I was drunk okay???But the point is you define your narrative with your actions. To give anymore power to your narrative and assume it as anything more just highlights the problem and takes the focus off of you as a person. So stop punching yourself! and start building something with that hand!Try. Fail. Reflect. Change. Try again. Dont give it anymore staying power in your brain than you have to.,KaizenBrotherhood,d6teasw,1,t5_35afn
9216337,0,t1_d8jovyd,I strongly disagree. Shortcutting it by first getting used to the cold water shortcircuits the whole idea.It is cold as hell in the beginning. Thats the key. When I started it it took me ten seconds to jump in put shampoo in my hair and onto my bodywash it off and jump out. But after it a feeling of warmth of having accomplished something great filled me up and I connect this habit to a lot of other things in my life. You just gotta get your shit together and jump in every day despite all the thoughts about turning it warmer or not doing it. I wish you the best on that journey.,KaizenBrotherhood,d8k8m2j,2,t5_35afn
