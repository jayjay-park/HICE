I had several friends in it who either forgot to turn in the quarterly paperwork or got a bad grade in a class and were kicked out. I managed to stay on top of the paperwork and do well in classes. It was such a relief to choose my classes and have everything open. No panic. No fear of not getting into a class. It made registering so easy and I graduated well on time.,CalPolyPomona,ck4fsl0,1,t5_2sdae

4058600,0,t3_3712gj,CPP emails work like normal emails.The problem is that certain professors use filtering tools on their CPP emails. Not all professors do this. Most professors should receive emails fine from gmail accounts. Some professors may require certain syntax in the titles or certain email domains to not get your email filtered out. If your professor uses email filtering he should have written it in the syllabus.The main reason that you should use your CPP email though is that your professor can look up your CPP email and confirm who you are. This is important for certain requests.,CalPolyPomona,criwslq,2,t5_2sdae

7679282,0,t3_4khybc,first of all  GPA only really matters a lot when it comes to impacted majorusually almost always STEM.  you can get into any basket weaving  major with a GPA as low as . after all that is the minimum.  transferring from a Cal state to a UC is tougher than switching from a CC to a UC or even highschool to a UC.  its not impossible  though and MANY have done it.  I would have much rather gone to any UC except riverside   tbh  but I didnt apply to UCs because I kept my goals realistic. out of all the Cal states CPP has the second best engineering program in general so I went ahead with that. so what if you end up going to your hometown CC  you save money in the long run and it gives you more time to explore your major options if youre not sure what you want to do. I can bet you itll be easier to get a better GPA at that CC than CPP. but if youre going to transfer and plan to do so  dont end up taking too core courses cause they might end up being useless,CalPolyPomona,d3f36zy,1,t5_2sdae
7881946,0,t3_4n9i7n,Alright so first of all getting a job is not an instant gratification. It is sometimes a long and tedious process but as long as you keep applying to places online or drive to the location itself and hand in a resume you will probably find job sooner or later. College is very expensive nowadays and if at the end of the day you dont have enough money youre gonna have to take out loans. It sucks but unfortunately thats how it works. If I recall we dont pay tuition until early September but keep checking your bronco email as the school will automatically send you reminders of important dates and such.
