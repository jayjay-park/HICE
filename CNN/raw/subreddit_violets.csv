11506185,0,t3_641hxe,Just returned from a plant festival and have the leaves of  types of AFs Im about to set up to root.  A little unsure about my potting medium and really want to use some old Styrofoam cups.  Any warnings regarding the Styrofoam?  I plan on cutting the top of the leaves placing the stems in the medium and then putting them all in a larger plastic container and let them sit in a well lit east facing room.  I also have a little root hormone Im going to use.  I guess I should have some babies in a month or so and ready to plant in  months.  ,violets,dg086hm,2,t5_2tkmd
