10736027,0,t1_ddn7yxk,Giving the way that damage can spike or fall flat I can totally see the luck factor. Had one turn where  archers did  damage to our Cragheart because of bad flips and another turn where I got attacked by  skeletons for  damage. We probably used some of our lose card powers too early. ,Gloomhaven,ddnc9ls,2,t5_3hpmt
10797119,0,t3_5twy7u,We are now  games in and have added another player. After toying around with Monster lvls we decided against tinkering with any addition House Rules.The game is just so tightly tuned that as you all stated it would skew the gameplay to far in our direction. Even playing at MLvl  while at Plvl  it felt to easy. The difficulty is perfect at equal lvls. ,Gloomhaven,ddtn98e,2,t5_3hpmt
11202465,0,t1_df1e0im,Ya Ive read through the FAQ a few times.  Thanks for the input.  I had this on a couple cards in error and it was too strong.  At least I get to pick from more diverse upgrade options now. ,Gloomhaven,df1s9qq,1,t5_3hpmt
11228028,0,t1_df4b0is,I dont burn cards to negate demage until Im down to  damage or its a hit of .  Ive played the first mission with almost every combo and never had a problem.  Spellweaver can nuke that first room and recover all her cards.  ,Gloomhaven,df4okji,1,t5_3hpmt

11341291,0,t3_61tmii,Scoundrel is so much better than she gets credit for.  Acting first Being invisible half the time and destroying bosses and high hp enemies is very underrated.  ,Gloomhaven,dfhikmq,3,t5_3hpmt
11460436,0,t3_63ijds,In Normal this scenario ends in about  or less rounds.  Feel free to use lost cards and let them whale on each other.,Gloomhaven,dfv176r,3,t5_3hpmt
11532870,0,t1_dg33rmh,Some great points there. The Flame Demons though there are plenty of melee damage classes that can just kill them outright with attacks even discounting instakills so its still kind of the same. They just punish you if you cant deal enough damage.,Gloomhaven,dg3949p,1,t5_3hpmt
11695892,0,t3_66u68r,Which cardability are you referring to that would provide you with a persistent bonus like this? ,Gloomhaven,dglqxig,1,t5_3hpmt
11696409,0,t1_dglqxig,I can answer this question but it will involve spoilers. Let me know if you want me to.,Gloomhaven,dglt1eh,1,t5_3hpmt
11768956,0,t1_dgtyp8b,Thanks for that clarification. I was curious whether that was possible or not as I ran out of cards and became exhausted. ,Gloomhaven,dgu1ivn,2,t5_3hpmt
