10638079,0,t1_ddd7z5e,I think their explanation of why it couldnt be kept private was valid though thats debatable.Also its worth noting that Heather didnt break the nudes story. DeodorAnthony posted the Youre worth getting arrested for screenshot first and called her by name. Only then did she post the rest of the texts so I dont think its an attention grab. Even if she did post the info first it still makes sense for her to do it now that people know how shitty of a person Zaptie is. You think people wouldve believed her a month ago?Edit Corrected quote,Zaptie,ddd8iob,1,t5_3erdr
