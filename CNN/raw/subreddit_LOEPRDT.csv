5602414,0,t3_3ruq9i,Why doesnt anybody talk about this card? I am definetly going to try this card instead of shredders in my secret paladin deck. For paladins its a  mana  argent horseman at worst plus after minibot and muster you get to drop this and after you just play loatheb and can attack again. Sure its less sticky and in the range of BGH but do you really care abou your  mana minion get BGHed?Edit Thanks for uadambard for correction. Turns out evaluating cards after a night of drinking wasnt a good idea ,LOEPRDT,cwrj7mo,-1,t5_3aodn
