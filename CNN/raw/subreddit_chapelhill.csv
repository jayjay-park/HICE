326600,0,t1_cfb139v,The signing in is a legal loophole in NC by the way. If a place sells food its exempt but otherwise the bar cant sell alcohol to the general public... only members. Not sure why Beer Study doesnt need to do this maybe because they sell bottles to go.,chapelhill,cfemffo,1,t5_2rohp

572069,0,t1_cg57k0s,Its a state requirement not just UNCCH. A lot of temp jobs will go up for a minimal length of time if there is someone in mind already..longer if they are actually looking. In the current funding environment its gonna be hard to get a foot in the door and have someone make a position for you. I know research techs being laid off left and right and they have priority for rehire by the state.  Id continue to look around and hit any job that comes up. Be prepared to email PIs for volunteer time as well to get that wet lab experience..and get known around a floor  hallway. ,chapelhill,cg5as1k,2,t5_2rohp
1028806,0,t3_25vs2j,TLDR maybe dsl.Longer explanation As in most of the US you can pick cable or DSL. Cable is a local Timer Warner monopoly you can sign up for Earthlink but its TWC under a different brand name. For DSL you have the option of ATampT or an ISP who leases from ATampT centurylink or frontier. The issue with any DSL option is that your speed is dependant on how close you are to the central office. If you are close gtkm you will have good speed but not as high as cable.The other complication is that if you live in an apartment complex. Some get paid off to only offer one service and even if you can choose if you have line issues then it can be really hard to get anything done as the telco will blame the apartment management for bad lines and vice versa.Switching can help you reduce cost. Canceling and going back on will give you a good deal on certain promotions so you might want to check it out. ,chapelhill,chl8bsf,1,t5_2rohp

6990803,0,t3_49kcuf,Its a college town most people know someone who can hook you up. And as far as prosecution goes just dont be foolish about where you smoke it and be super vigilant if you have to put it in your car  youll be fine.Edit I should clarify it would be incredibly foolish to smoke anywhere on South campus or North campus is risky  except for the cemeterybattle park.,chapelhill,d18r00h,1,t5_2rohp
7198119,0,t3_4e24r9,No real happy hours NC has banned happy hour specials all day special will be the best you can do. Unfortunately Saturdays dont have much in the way of those.I would recommend the Baxter in Carrboro its a cool barcade. Miltown has a very decent beer selection and huge patio also serves pretty good food. Top of the Hill is kind of a Chapel Hill landmark. Second Wind usually has some good music or something going on. The Cave and The Cellar are also pretty cool spots as is Zogs which is a pool hall if youre into that. Theres a cool little duo of restaurantbars in Carrboro called Calavera tequila and empanadas and The Shoppe whiskey and meatballs. For music Check out the Cave local  Cats Cradle and Second Wind at least one of them usually has something going on every night.Are you looking for anything specific? It being a college town the bar and restaurant scene is pretty extensive.,chapelhill,d1wd8xb,8,t5_2rohp

9346183,0,t1_d90lx1k,I know its not officially included but Ive read reports on the internet that when people have an internet connection that they were also able to get basic cable channels without paying for anything.

9706581,0,t1_da9hzwn,Shifts last  hours. We dont ask for any solid time commitments but volunteers typically volunteer  days a month. We do have folks who volunteer  times a year too. I honestly am happy to train anyone no matter what their commitment level may be. This is a tough gig and as such folks need to take breaks and some folks just give up on it all together. We respect that  and honor that. I am willing to give anyone a chance to try it out though and see if it is a good fit! We do training during scheduled shifts which helps us feel OK with the time commitment required to train. I dont want to waste your time nor do I want to waste our trainers time. We have you come during a shift so you can see if it is a good fit  ,chapelhill,da9jlqt,1,t5_2rohp

10146029,0,t3_5l4ie3,Ive been here since . Franklin Street has lost some of the gritty music scene since  that was akin to Austin today but the town has been upgraded quite a bit. UNC is at the tail end of a building boom following a  BBB BILLION dollar fundraising tear and downtown Chapel Hill has been built up literally...UP and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future according to my friend on the town council.As far as the Triangle is concerned it too is undergoing a building boom and many areas surrounding Raleigh are overbuilt for my taste. Durham is still as dirty as ever but in a hipster sort of way much safer and enjoyable now that the abandoned tobacco warehouses have been condoed and gentrified.My perspective is that this part of NC is one of the last few places in the US where one can put down roots however one pleases urban suburban or bucolic for a reasonable price high paying jobs are available and its all upside for those who work hard.This coming from an aging baby boomer who was raised in the shadow of New York City and has studied worked and lived in college towns ever since I left the northeast in . I set out that year to my education and to ultimately end up here in Chapel Hill or in Austin Texas. Since then I prefer NC because as bassackwards as the state government is here currently Texas locals are far worse IMHO.,chapelhill,dbu14ba,2,t5_2rohp

11374017,0,t3_61urme,Hi fellow UNC student here! Just in case you didnt know the UNC Symphony Orchestra is actually open to nonmajors  started with them when I didnt have either a major or minor declared! If youre not a major you wont be placed in the front stands though.I also heard that some students are trying to start a pops orchestra group on campus next year which sounds like it might be up your alley! But Im not sure if thats confirmed to be happening or not. Would keep an ear out for that in the coming weeks.Finally for pit orchestra music you could get directly in touch with groups like the Pauper Players? They typically send out emails asking for pit volunteers when theyre prepping shows.Good luck!,chapelhill,dfl83hc,1,t5_2rohp
