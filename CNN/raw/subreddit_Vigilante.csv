11582952,0,t1_dg88zko,OMG! That actually happened at the end of last term where it did get out to the local media yet the school was all hush hush about it. The schools way of giving out punishments and that are all ok as they have a child psychologist guy kinda. It is just their way of finding them. They can only catch them in the act of smoking or if they find something suspicious. They never have any ongoing investigations is what I am trying to say. I am thinking about finding out who the dealers are and talking to my tutor about it and try and get them expelled. Tbh I think going to the police and giving them a criminal record this early in life is too harsh. The dealers out of school I have an entirely different opinion on. Thank you so much for all your help!,Vigilante,dg8xngv,1,t5_2qt86
11728745,0,t3_660aq2,If you truly wish to help the drug issue then you wont go straight to thats illegal !.You find the reasons why people are using these substances you inform people and guide them to answers that will hopefully show them drugs doesnt help anything. You will provide assistance to fill the hold drugs may leave behind. You will research and find how little harm vaping does youll also find how marijuana isnt as bad as the War on Drugs propaganda makes you believe. Then after all that perhaps you may find the people spikinglacing the drugs with extra substances and put in end to it by which the best method of doing so is through law enforcement ,Vigilante,dgphfex,1,t5_2qt86
