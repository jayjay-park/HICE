If she talks about being crazy in love and intends it to be real but goes about emotionally cheating on you by keeping such contact with her ex then you have to ask yourself how real is this love shes talking about thats between the two of you? It sounds like she isnt at your level of maturity when it comes to relationships. She wants to have the new happy thing but wants to keep the ex along as a safety net. Youre not an upgrade with a rollback policy. You are an individual person who deserves the proper attention and devotion. From my anecdotal experience this behavior is a big red flag that she is flaky and doesnt understand the difference between loving someone and loving being in a relationship.Youre not just an accessory for her life. She can understand from your perspective of you can do better for yourself and keep searching for someone who loves you not just the idea of you. Best of luck in your decision andor reconciliation of your feelings. ,Relationship,cz24emr,3,t5_2quob

Just tell her its something u enjoy doing with her.In my opinion its something very trivial. I get that you want to watch it with her but I am sure that she can show you her love in other ways. Dont let that get in between you. ,Relationship,d93hnol,1,t5_2quob

If both of you get your own space for some time you come to realise how much you appreciate each other.,Relationship,df4g7wt,2,t5_2quob
