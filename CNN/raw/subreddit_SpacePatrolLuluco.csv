7915233,0,t1_d45kdmt,My opinion of Kiznaiver so far is that its a total mess. It started off strong with a concept full of potential what happens when human connections are forced too deep? but it quickly lost the plot through offtopic detours. After the setup suddenly everyone landed in summer camp then forget everything because one of the characters was a manga artist so lets look at only that for a few episodes... Ep made progress to bring everything back on track but the love squarepentagon was still largely an asspull that came out of nowhere.The characters themselves are cardboard cutout tropes that seem to have been pulled randomly from a hat. I think their designs are so mismatched that they all look like they walked out of different shows when they stand next to each other. The whole production is just so wonky that I cannot take anything seriously.Luluco by comparison knows exactly what kind of show it wants to be and goes all out with a lasersharp focus. It would have been easy for it to be a totally random show about random things happening but the whole thing has been carefully constructed to balance the wacky hijinks with a fairly simple touching story. Its a lot of fun to watch and it leaves something to think about between episodes. Thats why I like it so much.I guess I care about this a lot because I was expecting great things from Kiznaiver and it let me down. ,SpacePatrolLuluco,d45qwyu,2,t5_3e5ca
