10862505,0,t3_5v8yxw,We were in a similar situation except there wasnt a bond anywhere. First I would highly recommend a respite. For us this helped but didnt solve the problem. ampnbsp Second I think you need to work with your caseworker and husband to figure out a plan to solve these issues or discuss finding him a different home. ampnbspTheres also types of therapy out there where therapists talk into a head phone and help you learn to handle children like him.ampnbspTeens are hard. Good luck.,Fosterparents,de0e2t9,1,t5_2xchv
