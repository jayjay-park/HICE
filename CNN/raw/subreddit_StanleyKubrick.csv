1440284,0,t1_citqonw,Yeah. Theres a bunch of crazy BS in that movie. I dont even understand the logic behind leaving the kids crying in there? What the fuck was that? In of my favorite resources about Kubrick is www.kubrickfilm.tripod.comThere is so much really good research on that site you almost dont need to go anywhere else ever. If you look on the left tab youll see a link called imperfect symmetries there is an insane amount of content on the shining there. Sure some if not most is speculation but really well educated speculation. Whoever did all that work for the site really understands so much about film and people. ,StanleyKubrick,ciwte51,2,t5_2sm5x
1501539,0,t3_2bc13z,I hope.  And if they do depending on the film they need all released aspect ratios.  For say Full Metal Jacket . and . the same for The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut.  Barry Lyndon in ..  No more bullshit.,StanleyKubrick,cj4hpkj,1,t5_2sm5x

1753835,0,t3_2e4su7,Speaking of Wendy Carlos does anyone know how she got that vocal in ode to joy? Is it some kind of home made vocoder? Ive never been able to place the effect.,StanleyKubrick,ck08913,1,t5_2sm5x
1777548,0,t3_2ev1bu,The secret is out. We have seen through the lies and now we know the truth. Kubrick had so many cats because they were really his target audience all along. His films can telepathically communicate with them. Theres no other explanation.,StanleyKubrick,ck37qnx,11,t5_2sm5x

2525599,0,t3_2ol4pc,So as a research tip instead of just aiding and abetting plagiarism perhaps take a look at a few other major Vietnam films. When did they come out? What was the general response critically and otherwise? This is all easy Googling. When does FMJ fit within that? Was it received differently? How does it compare formally to those other films visually structurally aurally? Do these distinctions or similarities relate to the milieu at all? Etc etc.,StanleyKubrick,cmo8dyw,3,t5_2sm5x
2697545,0,t1_cnao861,funny you mention that...by the end of the night during one o f the last scenes we shot..we started going for a comedic tone. I took out the scene of course in this cut..but what happens is man runs to a harbor an goes into a corner gets his phone out calls someone...and says wheres the boat!...you forgot the boat!?  in a very comedic way. Hes actually great at being comedic...I wish I had more ideas to elaborate this short film I got here cause I went into it with no plot in mind..it just happened to be a paranoia situation cause what else can you really do with one person in the middle of the city? Any ideas? ,StanleyKubrick,cnaory6,1,t5_2sm5x
3028160,0,t1_cobtlpw,I think EWS has over the years become much more popular then at release.  That Cruise is a Scientologist has not really effected his popularity or getting big box office.  It might be true that they arent still together and arent  talking about the film much these days but they did so many interviews in the past proclaiming how wonderful Kubrick was as a director and how they love the film that more of that isnt really necessary.    EWS stands on its own at it has become a part of the cultural memes as has all the Kubrick films and will continue to be talked about and watched repeatedly because it has so many layers of meaning and mystery.,StanleyKubrick,cobv7fu,3,t5_2sm5x

Personally I think this painting gives you a very good impression of Stanleys personality and character.

5305377,0,t3_3nm3ly,Hmm the author lays out a syllabus basically but even if Paths Of Glory is the best starting point for a beginner cant say never having seen it popular consensus would seem to disagree with placing it among the essential four.My essential four would be  Clockwork Strangelove and Lyndon.,StanleyKubrick,cvptnm5,0,t5_2sm5x

7065972,0,t3_4b0x3c,You left out Kubricks obsession with his own pets and cats.  He had a subscription to Cat magazines and would leave incredibly detailed instructions on how to care for his cats to his daughters when he needed too.  But honestly we all have obsessions or things that just particularly interest us.  We wouldnt be in this sub if we didnt. ,StanleyKubrick,d1haglu,1,t5_2sm5x
