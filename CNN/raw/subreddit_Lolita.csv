54390,0,t1_cef6cbc,Well here is Bodylines point of view of the situation. Honestly Id take both sides of the story with a bit of skepticism as it is apparent that they dont trust each other either and were apparently difficult to work with.According to Bodyline Venuss mother was attempting to blackmail them into participating in the Living Doll seriesshow thing by publicly posting imagesfootage of Mr.Yan that he said were not allowed to be posted on the internet.,Lolita,cekmetf,5,t5_2sf5v

245461,0,t3_1wrgj4,I adore sailor lolita actually just got a dress for it gtult and I find classic nicely refined. But gothic appeals to me as does sweet not ott more of a toned down kind or bittersweet.Honestly I love all the styles .u.,Lolita,cf670dl,2,t5_2sf5v

473082,0,t3_1zf26k,I agree with everything else that has been said here.  It hurts and its hard to take I was posted to BTB twice in less than a month this time last year.  While it hurt I did take away some additional lessons aside from what was already posted here be careful who you are friends with and be careful about what pictures you share on facebook.  Having polished coordinates will help go a long way with confidence and try to ignore anything that isnt constructive criticism.  Hang in there and feel free to message me if you ever want to talk. lt,Lolita,cfu1iu9,2,t5_2sf5v

1485540,0,t3_2b72lr,I second looking for poses you like.  Are you working with a photographer? They may offer advice to you.  If not take time to review the pictures as you take them and think what you can do to to make it better. Try a different smile head turn or hand placement. ,Lolita,cj2hk57,3,t5_2sf5v

1869329,0,t3_2fyaho,If in doubt get an Aline. Generally speaking you can wear an Aline petticoat under any skirt though it wont have quite the same shape under a rectangular skirt but you cant wear a cupcake petticoat under an Aline skirt or it looks super goofy. Tiered and Aline skirts work best with Aline petticoats and rectangular or trapezoid skirts usually work better with a cupcake petticoat though they can be worn with an Aline.,Lolita,ckeg4gk,2,t5_2sf5v

2061761,0,t1_ckkuutd,Im not an expert by any means but from what I can tell once its out of stock they dont really bring it back. At least for the bigger brands anyway. If theres one you really want that they dont have anymore youll have to look around for secondhandcommunity sales.,Lolita,cl1w84n,1,t5_2sf5v
2493617,0,t1_cmk0ip0,Thanks! The quality is pretty good. There were a few loose threads and stuff when I first pulled it out but those were easily trimmed. Infanta may not be as sought after as BtSSB or AP but I love their designs and would recommend their clothes.,Lolita,cmk1y1x,2,t5_2sf5v
3049447,0,t1_coe1gs5,Yea I was thinking of bringing more whit down but bringing more black up sounds better.

3374678,0,t3_2yr8na,If you dont want to buy online you can always find lots of shoes in thriftvintage shops and even regular retail stores and of course those go up to fairly large sizes. Id be wary since you say its your first time in lolita but if you know anyone with experience you could try taking them with you to help pick appropriate shoes. Something like these you can find at a store like Walmart fairly easily although they lean towards classic Mary janes are more on the sweet side like these and definitely casual which you may find in a regular retail store And if youd prefer flats these are okay too Id suggest looking for white pairs because its pretty difficult to find sax shoes outside of the lolita world haha.,Lolita,cpcxsa2,2,t5_2sf5v

3581196,0,t3_31c1n4,Lovely! Its so hard to find cute tartan pieces. If you dont mind some concrit I think the coord would benefit from accenting in some pink. Perhaps a pink pair of shoes and a bag? I also think the shoes might be a little too sweet for a classic coordinate. Regardless you look really gorgeous and I hope you have had?? a lovely evening with your family,Lolita,cq0hgrb,5,t5_2sf5v

4178077,0,t3_38mt15,Trim your bangs! Wigs come with extra long bangs so you can cut them into the proper length yourself. They look awkward clipped to the side like that.For the Lost in Sea OP coord I would recommend sax shoes. The white dont really go with the rest of the outfit but sax would match the purse and look good with the dress!,Lolita,crwi7rw,3,t5_2sf5v

4257024,0,t3_39paar,Real lolita fashion is not about being sexy in any way and your outfit pose and twitter hashtags seem to suggest thats what you are going for. To be honest it is a bit off putting for the users in the sub because thats kind of the opposite of what they are going for.If you really like lolita fashion catcircle gave you some great resources to start with and there is no reason you couldnt pull off the fashion if you put the time in to understand it. ,Lolita,cs5hg38,7,t5_2sf5v

5213135,0,t1_cv2360o,Thank you so much for the ideas! Archduchess you have really helped. My hair is nearly waist length and for work it absolutely has to be contained no loose strands or fly aways no one really wants long hair in their food   and Ive been experimenting with twists and pony tails with flowers but Id love to see the tutorials you mentioned. Sorry it took so long for me to respond was out of internet for a few days.The shoes thing is my biggest issue. They have to be nonslip and my maybe my Googlefoo isnt up to the task but all the shoes Ive found are either clunky not made for standing for hours on end I found a pair of . inch nonslip heels I cant imagine the cook who would find those comfortable no matter how adorable! for  hours at a stretch or just plain dull. I do have a favorite apron that I wear to work on occasion a bright yellow flowered pinaforeesque little darling but I definitely need to learn to sew to make bettercuter ones.Unfortunately skirts are currently out of the question until I want to wear thick leggings underneath hot oil spilled on nylons or other thin leggings is not a recipe for health. But pants are sooooo not Lolita of my style. I tend to gravitate toward bright colorful playful or elegant with an edge of Goth at least as far as Ive come to understand it only been researching fashion and Goth for a couple months. So far Ive found that a neutral base and a modestly bright top is the best compromise. But then the top is covered at work so whats the point of wearing it when even I cant see it?TaoBao sounds like it could help me out though and I look forward to seeing your links for tutorials. If you ever need a good recipe look me up. Im a wiz at finding them or modifying them after all I am a cook for a living  ,Lolita,cvedji5,1,t5_2sf5v

5561426,0,t3_3qrktb,Just now starting to plan for my meet! Ack. Every year I say Ill start sooner but October is just so busy. Im in Vegas so there is plenty of unique things to do just have to find the right price point for the group. Last winter ILD we went to Madame Tussauds then a Gordon Ramsey restaurant then a monthly outdoor art festival. This summer ILD we did lunch in The Cosmopolitan and pictures in the Bellagio garden. This year Im looking at  Capos Speakeasy  Mobthemed diner suggested by a friend but Im worried about how dark it is inside and staining dresses.  High Roller  Giant ferris wheel on the Vegas strip. The Linq which is a street full of restaurants and little shops is also right in front of it. Stratosphere Tower  Great place for photos and reasonably priced food options but has a fee to get in. Ethel M Chocolate Factory  Free tour and cactus garden with nighttime list display. If not for ILD thinking about doing this or a Hogwartsthemed gettogether for christmas.,Lolita,cwmg1ye,1,t5_2sf5v
6225309,0,t3_40t365,CDJapan is popular for ordering KERA Gothic amp Lolita Bible brand  MOOKs and other Japanese fashion magazines. Stores like Kinokuniya will also carry some. For strictly lolita GampLB would be the best since its almost completely lolita and will show information like prices. But you arent able to order through them besides calling the stores number and putting in a reservation but that only works for in Japan.Also many pieces shown in these magazines will already be up for reservation or wont be up for order for a while. They are also completely in Japanese and cater to people living in Japan. I follow Lolita Updates on Facebook which has magazine scans as well and use that along with brand twitter accounts to follow news instead. ,Lolita,cyx905g,2,t5_2sf5v

6833782,0,t3_49ae4b,Its only really considered ita because of the mistakes that are so easy to make with it like a beginner with classic black and white and way too many frills and bows and just badly put together.  If youre a beginner like Uufi said I also recommend against starting out with Wa and starting with some of the easier styles... its easy to pair princess sleeves with Sweet Gothic or Classic. If you like the patterned style of Wa Sweet and Bitter Sweet would be your better bets to try.Once youre more comfortable with coordinating and have built your wardrobe up to the basics then you should give it a try after looking at what other Wa Lolitas wear.,Lolita,d0qwsa0,3,t5_2sf5v
