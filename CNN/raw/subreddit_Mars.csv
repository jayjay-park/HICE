The researchers detected the water using Raman scattering spectroscopy which reflected a laser off the surface and produced a distinctive signature.Use robots to collect this perchlorate then dump it on the polar caps during the warmer times of year and see what happens.,Mars,cinjkty,1,t5_2qku9

7320424,0,t1_d29v8ph,for the sake of crop variability would want to have a few species of different genesis for each nitch so that if one species is killed or hindered by something the whole system wont suffer a cascading failure. I wasnt saying not to use arctic plants that survive cold temperatures I was suggesting that we keep the pressure a bit higher than the standard in Hellas basin for the sake of not being as extreme on the plants. A tented doom with slightly increased pressure would be a lot easier to maintain than a full life support habitat. The issue with using water ice to seal the edge of the tent is that were assuming the inside of the tent will have plants in it. Generally speaking for the plants to grow the temperature will have to be greater than zero degrees Celsius for some extended period. This means the seal on at the bottom of the door that is keeping it sealed to the ground will slowly melt and weaken which might lead to blowouts or leaks. You need some material that isnt super dependant on variable conditions. When I say concrete I mean some pourable material that cures and becomes solid. Also burying the greenhouse doom doesnt seem like it would work well as it eliminates the light from the sun. You could use artafcial lighting but that takes power and more infrastructure.,Mars,d2aa5kv,1,t5_2qku9

7945448,0,t1_d48ynss,Speaking for myself  I disagree.  Taking the long slow development path results in the overall Mars plan being at the whim of shifting political favors and budgets.  Currently were looking at  years until boots on Mars which is five presidential terms and a minimum of three different people.  Hell Constellation didnt survive the change of administrations and actual hardware was produced and flown for that one.I think that doing it fast would help prevent that.,Mars,d4955dt,1,t5_2qku9

Medical issues will be corrected by medical means long before there is any chance for speciation. People would not tolerate the alternative they would work harder to correct it or they would leave.

10632565,0,t3_5rzhre,Main takeaways Mars lost most of its liquid water due to atmospheric escape. It was previously thought water was prevented from escape due to cold trapping in lower layers of the atmosphere. During southern summers water molecules escape from ice deposits into the air. Molecules at mid altitudes are broken into hydrogen and oxygen by high levels of UV in the relatively unfiltered sunlight. The hydrogen easily rises through the atmosphere and escapes.  This effect is weaker in the northern summer when Mars is further away from the Sun.Side note a while back I remember hearing this mechanism as a possible explanation for Mars being so rusty. With all the hydrogen loss surface oxides would be much more likely. Unfortunately if true this means we cant terraform Mars back to its former wet glory by simply heating it up. Even a warm Mars would be pretty dry if we dont reintroduce lots of water.,Mars,ddco2ka,2,t5_2qku9

11679898,0,t3_66l6dw,The wall estimates are somewhere better  to  billion. If we say spacex has used  billion dollars to get to where it is today  worth then you get a rough tripling or doubling of where they are currently.Or if a falcon  launch is  million dollars then between  and  falcon  launches.I dont think we can yet put a actual price on the development and launch cost of the ITSIf it then costs as much to maintain every seven years and the wall cost  billion dollars that means a addition falcon  could be launched every  days for as long as the wall would be up.As a falcon  can get kg to mars that quickly adds up to a high amount of material moved.Over  years thats . million kgs or  tonnes.We can assume that the its would be more efficient than this but we cant give a actual value as of now.These values are for the  billion one off sum and every seven years paying the same again.,Mars,dgjxlp1,1,t5_2qku9
