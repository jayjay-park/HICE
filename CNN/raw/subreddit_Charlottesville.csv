3884005,0,t3_34vmca,I ate there a lot when I was younger Hispanic and while none of us have the right to tell you your feelings were right or wrong I think you went about expressing it the wrong way. Systemic racism is real but it isnt about conspiracy and collusion to act prejudicially under subterfuge its about systems that undervalue and underrepresent minorities. Could this establishment have a policy of discriminating against minorities? Sure but not likely. Could this waitress have a history of refusing to serve minorities? Sure but not likely. Whats as likely is that it was Saturday they are busy understaffed and she isnt a great waitress. Whats as likely is that she knows what kind of joint they are and that if she spends all her time serving regulars and groups of  then she will get a lot more in tips than if she focuses on small tables. You felt what you felt and nothing we say should change that. But just because you felt it doesnt mean it was true. And to write a Yelp and Reddit review where you express these feelings as facts just hurts your argument. Stick to things you know to be true. And consider calling and asking to speak to a manager. That Yelp review wont change anything. Telling a manager that you had a bad experience irrespective of perceived racial undertones might have a bigger impact than you think.,Charlottesville,cqz0d2u,12,t5_2qhq4

UVA didnt have a lot of new student housing at the time and they tried to fill that gap. Im sure it worked for a few years but its location runs in direct contravention to what has become the major principle of millennial housing being walkable and accessible. So when places like the Pavilion and now the Flats were built it just decimated any appeal of any of the Ivybased properties.So Eagles landing was made cheaply and for students but now it doesnt even do a good job job filling that role in the marketplace.

No problems with coral reefs.  No problems with ingredients.If you are worried about the health of your body you wouldnt consider base tanning as it is guaranteed to cause damage when there is only some anecdotal evidence that the bad chemical sunscreens might cause some people issues sometimes and when you can simply use zincbased or even titanium dioxide though there is perhaps evidence it might not be quite as effective as zinc oxide physical sunscreens.,Charlottesville,czhyina,3,t5_2qhq4
