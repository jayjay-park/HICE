5952115,0,t1_cxztlgp,Ive been going to Ren Faire my whole life.  It really does destroy the environment.  Its a poor mans Anime Expo for some of these guys and it takes the fun out of ren faire.  Why the fuck would anyone want to see a chubby Sephiroth or fucking Doctor Who at these things?  The Doctor Who joke was funny the one time When the first guy did it.  Now we have all these kids coming as Doctor Who Marty McFly and other time travelers like its funny to disillusion the whole point anyone goes to these things.  Then theres the steampunk kids.  Why the fuck are there Victorian era shops in the Renascence Era?  It makes no sense.  Punkmetalheads are starting to come as well.  Thats all fine and dandy and you can come however youre dressed.  But it just takes away even more immersion when you got light blue denim jackets with The Addicts or The Dead Kennedys on them.In the s till about like  it was a relatively normal place.  You might have some fantasy cosplay LoTR Warcraft but shit at least it blended well.  But now?  Its all just a bunch of fucking kids that want a reason to dress up like their favorite animu rather than be part of the Faire.Also beers are like  dollars a red cup now so fuck that too.,TheSquadOnPoint,cxzup1p,5,t5_37p32

On the other hand if this subreddit devolves into making fun of retarded people it will be ruined.Yup thats because it would be funny even if he wasnt developmentally stunted.
