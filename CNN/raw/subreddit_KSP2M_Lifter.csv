3001960,0,t1_co8uaxd,At the moment we are assuming that the payload will do manoeuvring but that may change aswhen we hear from the orbiter crowd. Ive had a go at making a lightmedium orbital manoeuvring vehicle but havent done a heavy one yet.Also I think the main goals are in order Relatively bugfree  e.g. majority of launches will by bugless and require no restarts and any bugs present can be avoided. Total payload to orbit  the higher the better. At the moment we have two approved designs and one design that we would like to get working but cant seem to the Odysseus Heavy. Realistic  Stay away from asparagus staging if you can and keep designs looking good if possible. Easy to fly. If it requires splitsecond timing its less likely to get used as it will be harder to programming for.kOS is something you probably dont have to deal with if you dont want to  try and make sure all of your rockets have a kOS enabled part found under Control on them and also a probe core and decent omni antenna e.g. Communication  within a fairing.I tend to fly by hand but I make sure I pitch at the same point or I alter the pitch point to alter my trajectory as a basic gravity turn is typically the most efficient way to orbit path of least resistance etc.I dont remember seeing details on the actual rendezvous orbit  originally it was quite a bit higher but I am not  on the final plan  there was talk of nuclear engines on the Orbiter being used as a tug and starting from LEO km orbit so someone else will have to answer that.In game cost is arbitrary and while its a loose guideline it is not a fantastic one. For example in most of my rockets the main cost comes from the fairings and decouplers because of how procedural parts works out their value not the engines or the millions of litres of Liquid Hydrogen that goes into them.Ultimately good luck trying to build a realistic rocket that can carry  tonnes of Hydrogen into LEO  anything over about t will be lifting mostly wet mass and a t LH tank is roughly a m x m cylinder. Without using boosters it is either ridiculously wide and so unrealistic or ridiculously tall so it doesnt fit in the VAB. With boosters the game engine seems to have problems.If you can manage it then go for it  The Odysseus Heavy once worked but now Engine Igniter is in the pack seems not to. Ive got a t variant I am working on but when I go much larger I tend to have problems.As a final note would you mind posting subsequent questions in our FAQ thread that is pinned at the top of the Subreddit? It lets others easily view the same answers that you have got helping answer everybodys questions.I will copy the question and answer over shortly because these are the sort of questions that everybody will need the answer to.,KSP2M_Lifter,co95g67,2,t5_35uuc
3304276,0,t1_cp4uj0o,Just a heads up guys Im going to need more time to look at the x ton launch plan. Its going to be close isnt it always? and unless I can figure out a way to cut out some mass Im not sure if we can do it for less than  tons per launch. Let me know ASAP if thats possible. Thanks. uctrlurootnegative ,KSP2M_Lifter,cp4wwym,1,t5_35uuc
