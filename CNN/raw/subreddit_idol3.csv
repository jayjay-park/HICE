3949923,0,t1_cr6cbwg,Curious what your reasoning is. Dropping the price after the launch is usually the sign of a poor reception read Amazon Fire Phone. If they thought  was a great price Im not sure why they wont just sell the phone  ? ,idol3,cr6iwxj,1,t5_378ur

4597692,0,t1_ct66y79,Mainly the screen size and quality but it also has dual front speakers its reversible and has nearstock android Touchwiz feels sluggish after a while. It also supports TMobile Band  I have TMobile. The rest of the hardware is pretty much a wash CPU camera etc. Granted its not a MAJOR upgrade but I do feel its a nice upgrade especially for the price.,idol3,cta4ob7,1,t5_378ur
4694671,0,t3_3f8kfp,So with the announcement of the new Conquest smartphone from Alcatel Onetouch they have also announced a new lowend phone that will be released on August with . installed.

5029658,0,t1_cus3xau,Android M would be a better choice IMHO.In my experience on this phone I am really not seeing significant bugs with the current OS.  My phone is boring i.e. it just works.Since fixes dont seem to be urgent see ZenFone  battery drain issue which we dont seem to have why not go for the better upgrade and wait a bit more?,idol3,cus9kpg,2,t5_378ur
5121850,0,t3_3l4oau,What made you move from the GS N then settling on the Idol ?  I sort of already sold myself on the idea of having an sd card slot so Im hesitant on the OPO. Zenfone  I just cant stand the skin. Unless I find something terrible by November Im probably going with the Idol . If not Ill just get the Moto X Pure. ,idol3,cv3di73,1,t5_378ur

6028923,0,t3_3y187a,I really hope so.My worst fear is that they just let the Idol  fade away into the distance when they unveil those shiny new phones at CES. ,idol3,cy9wtnc,5,t5_378ur
6470715,0,t1_cz8khaq,Theres an app called Twilight that can bring the lowest brightness down even further. It does it by dimming the screen but its VERY effective at night and even has a blue light filter if youre into that.,idol3,czom90q,1,t5_378ur
6762350,0,t3_47cp7e,Been using mine almost day to day because I dont feel like lugging around my ATHMs in my day pack. Theyre honestly better than any prepackaged earbuds that Ive tried. Obviously if you already have a tried and true set of headphones that you usually use these probably wont compare. For free headphones theyre pretty good IMO.,idol3,d0isgz1,0,t5_378ur

9407250,0,t1_d986yho,Just to make sure you know using a lower effective dpi allows the assets to be drawn smaller. That means text and boxes are smaller which means apps such as facebook can show more content.Heres an exampleTo answer your question now i use a lower dpi because i feel like the default dpi is a joke. I used to be on team Apple and their assets are drawn much smaller on the screen. My hypothesis to this is historical compatibility android has been forever developed to be ultracompatible which would mean it has to work with reactive touchscreens low accuracy.Now that capacitive touchscreens are much more common android should drop the horrible huge buttons and text. I invite you to try a lower effective dpi and judge by yourself youll understand.,idol3,d98fo1u,1,t5_378ur
