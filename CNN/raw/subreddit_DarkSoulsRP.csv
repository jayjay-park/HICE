7959716,0,t3_4o78n1,Lief looked closely around the caves entrance. There had been some traffic apparently hours before him. Maybe they would have dealt with any traps or nonundead threats that dwelt below. Although maybe if he waited someone else might show up. Someone more skilled than him to deal with whatever lurkedin the cave.,DarkSoulsRP,d4aqwnl,1,t5_3eukd
8137121,0,t1_d4unu6m,Youve got some fucking nerve she swore punching him across the face once more. She leaned back and looked down towards a Pyromancy tome which he clung onto. She snatched it from his old hand and raised it overhead  growing ever more desperate. Dont you fucking understand old man?! There is no choice! she reared backwards stabbing him in his shoulder and twisting the dagger her voice raising TELL ME!,DarkSoulsRP,d4uoq5k,1,t5_3eukd
8159140,0,t3_4mkwj4,. Beatrice Hargrave. Female             lbs technically weightless. During her life Beatrice was an Astoran noblewoman. Her family the Hargraves were wellknown for the vast amounts of land and wealth they owned though they also tended to be wellliked for their charity and the fairness they treated their workers with.Beatrice grew up to be a typical Hargrave woman. Proud to the point of toeing haughtiness inquisitive and loathe to be accused of cowardice or injustice.In addition she adopted a deepseated dislike for another Astoran noble family the Ashworths. The dislike between the two houses stemmed from a land dispute over several acres of forest nearby both families lands. Though the Ashworths were the registered owners of the forest the Hargraves claimed to have owned the land originally and that the Ashworths had obtained it illegitimately.Not one to question her own familys side of the story nor turn the other cheek Beatrice took up the family tradition of provoking the Ashworths by treating the land as their own. Her preferred methods were deliberate trespassing and hunting on their grounds.Little did she know that such petty actions would lead to her demise. As her own hunting party scoured the woods for deer the Ashworths youngest son also happened to be hunting in the the same forest.Spotting a solitary deer Beatrice separated from her own hunting party to track the animal. As she stalked after the animal through some sparser foliage she was shot through the chest by the youngest Ashworth.Her last memories were that of the redstained ground and the sound of a young mans frantic swearing before she slipped into unconsciousness and eventually died of blood loss.Her spirit now wanders the deep and has been doing so for countless ages.. None. None. None. Ghost,DarkSoulsRP,d4xfvmp,3,t5_3eukd
8164588,0,t1_d4y49pq,From what I know  Sir Harken is at the Bonfire about what happened here though.. Robert was about to say to Marinko what happened here when he had an Idea. The man was using a crossbow And they knew the beast was Massive in size according to the onion Knight and that meant that its attacks probably were in close range..they could use an Archer during this battle.Tell me Marinko. Robert said taking out his Helm and looking the small man in the eyes. How would you feel about becoming my squire ?.,DarkSoulsRP,d4y4e8h,5,t5_3eukd

8184801,0,t1_d50n44v,GRAAAHHH!Volur fell to his knees. He failed Robert. He had failed the Sun. He began to feel the world fade around him... calling him back to further within. No... I... I am not...Volur knew he could do nothing. Marinko... Why?He knew it was likley he could not be heard but he looked at the direction in which the little squire had ran. His expression if any was around to see was not one of rage or frustration but one of dissappointment tinged by disbelief. But the world faded and the heir of Sunlight did too. There was no trace that Volur had ever been there afterward.,DarkSoulsRP,d50nfpw,2,t5_3eukd

8216919,0,t1_d54kjxh,Her arrow did indeed strike true but did not make her prey fall off the cliff fortuitous as that may have been! The manservant raised its urn overhead and looked puzzled down at its foot that now had an arrow poisoned? sticking out of it and it bellowed looking around to seek what puny creature could have done such a thing. It takes it a while to find the wolfgirl easily long enough for her to fire another shot.,DarkSoulsRP,d54o4s9,1,t5_3eukd
8240598,0,t1_d57mfbx,Chance watched as the woman died waiting expectantly for her to return to the bonfire. It took longer than he expected. More than ten minutes had expired before the ladyknight would appear there again.Marinko I told you to leave! What are you still doing here? Chance worried about the young man hed stopped caring for his own husk long ago.And then her ashes swept into view reconstituting her body from the boots up her armor forming with her as she resurrected. As was the curse of all Undead. She must have died so many more times than Chance she seemed younger than him or at least of a close age but clearly her mind had suffered from the hollowing force of repeated death repeated loss repeated disillusionment.Alayne! he waited until she he had picked up and put on his helmet This dagger! he held the small blade aloft Tell me what this means to you!,DarkSoulsRP,d57mpzk,2,t5_3eukd
8240868,0,t1_d57nue6,Alayne sighed sheathing the two swords and walked over to the knife crouching with a groan. Im getting too old to keep up these fights every day I feel these aches more and more. He sheathed the knife and walked over to a nearby tree.He took out the greatsword heaving it over his shoulder and slammed the point into the ground. He leaned back against the tree bringing the greatsword close. Time to let her have it back I guess Ill be watching these dumbfucks however. Smacking his lips a few times he got comfortable and let his head rest on the sword.,DarkSoulsRP,d57nxku,2,t5_3eukd
8257680,0,t1_d59mh0c,It happened in a damned instant. The barrier fell and so did the rest of the facade. The forest became furious steamingly furious as felt by the now hot sun and had sent every animal in the forest after Galaye.She had started by climbing up the tree she had been sitting under at first. Only birds could get her up here and she could swat them away with her greatsword. She had managed to get farther up the tree when a nearby branch swung at her and knocked her off. A nearby bear reared its ugly teeth ready for a meal.She couldnt die yet. If she died here would she come back at the bonfire? Would she just be gone forever?Either way she really didnt want to die.Uther help!,DarkSoulsRP,d59rmb9,1,t5_3eukd
8312209,0,t1_d5gkutv,Alighieri took a step back the  Armored human holding his hands out by his side as the Krogran showed up and picked up the Turian like a piece of wet tissue paper. He cleared his throat patting his thighs and turning towards where the other twod gone wanting absolutely nothing to do with the Krogan and whatever he decides to make of the Turian.I dont get paid enough for this shit.He took a deep breath calming his nerves a bit. He took a few steps towards the docking bay exit placing a hand on his forehead.Busy busy busy busy...,DarkSoulsRP,d5gl04k,2,t5_3eukd

Thankfully he wasnt being thrown across the room so he guessed it was alright.His head slamming forward onto empty air he looked up Why is everyone in Lothric such a giant he asked as if it was the most important question which could be asked.,DarkSoulsRP,d5yxtz4,3,t5_3eukd
8469590,0,t1_d5zrzy7,Harken balled his free hand into a fist trying his best to not shout at the hexer standing beside him. Temper Harken temper. Regardless some irritation doubtlessly slipped through into his words as he spoke That is all well and good hexer but do warn me properly when you create a bomb on my shoulder next time yes? He said no more falling back in line with the others as they made their way up the tower towards their destination. Calm yourself man. Take a deep breath count to ten...,DarkSoulsRP,d608l5o,1,t5_3eukd
8473325,0,t1_d60p74v,Rose gave a gentle wave to the man as he left a smile on her face. See you around Kalos thanks for your contribution. She said cheerily collecting the things he prepared with the rest of the prepared veggies.Were more or less done the boring stuff. The vegetables are prepared just need to boil them when the time to serve comes along.  Weve no meat to work with yet and theres already a few bread rolls and the like in the crates. She grabbed about  baking pans and laid them out she began to grease them up with butter. She washed her hands and grabbed as much flour eggs salt and sugar as she could. She got inspired she wanted to make some cookies or something of the like for dessert. She began to root through the crates looking for vanilla extract nearly falling into the crate as she scoured the bottom of the boxes for the substance. Laney! Did you ever find that vanilla? I need it too! She cried hands on her hips as frustration overtook her. ,DarkSoulsRP,d60pgio,2,t5_3eukd

8506227,0,t1_d64thaz,Marinko leapt back with a yelp as the dagger nearly pinned his foot to the forest floor he turned and pointed with his blade angrily as he spotted his would be assassin. He quickly searched for a pathway up to the beast but saw nothing of the sort in the immediate area short of scaling the rocks they had no way to retaliate as it crept away saving itself from a hail of arrows and magic bolts. He kicked at the dirt in annoyance. ,DarkSoulsRP,d64u0ec,2,t5_3eukd
8518567,0,t1_d66dhxu,poeIn the distance a woman could be seen shuffling through the toxic marsh. Her skin was gray in texture and tone matching the vestments that adorned her body. A worn tattered skirt accompanied her legs shifting in the wind as she continued to run. Her stomach was exposed her chest covered by a humble wrap towards a blackveiled hood. A metal shoulder pauldron rested atop her left faintly glowing a light blue as she continued to  sprint. From behind her jetblack veil she saw them   Undead explorers amidst the swamp. She sprinted in their direction and from around the corner approached two colossal figures accompanied by a small group of diseased tribal men.Two massive horned demons followed her in rapid pursuit wielding massive a massive tree trunk in its arm. Dark skulls radiated around the creature as it pursued the skinny frail female. She turned mid pursuit and rose her staff high slamming it back down before her. Suddenly the hooded female glowed a bright blue. She thrust her staff forward and the Catalyst from her gem erupted to a massive sorcery. A massive beam shot from her staff  a soul stream for the educated  piercing through one of the massive horned demons chests and bringing him down with a single mighty spell.One of the smaller tribal men leaped upon her tackling her to the ground and into the swamp. She struggled beginning to be swarmed.,DarkSoulsRP,d66dqt4,1,t5_3eukd
8771453,0,t1_d70lgq8,A shrill screech reverberated through the arena overpowering the clashing of steel and the roaring of the blood thirsty crowd.  What felt like thousands of pounds of pressure filled the announcers head as the abnormally loud and high pitched noise entered through his ear drums making him slam his head on the hard stone of his perch in hopes of knocking himself out.  Please make it stop he pleaded with his own thoughts before searching for the source of the noise.  His hands shook as he gazed upon Rense and then a marsama of blue light something very very bad was about to happen down there and he was glad he wasnt a part of it.Kulinos smaller than average dirk connected with Pons abdomen once before she slipped off the knife accompanied by the sight of a puddle of blood spreading across her leather armor.  Ignoring what she temporarily thought of as a small inconvenience the knight pulled back her twin curved swords for a sloppy counter attack only to find the crazed knight gone.  Looking over to the apprentice she yelled Rense a short warning before limping after Kulino but she hadnt made it in time.  Kulinos dirk reached half way into the boys eye making him let out a short whimper as he shook from a combination of fear and disunderstanding thoughts no longer on the soul arrow it shot forwards impacting with the arenas stone walls.Head turning towards Pons at her rudimentary warning dread and terror quickly filled her very being as she saw the dirk falling towards the boys eyes.  Heart racing Rense let out a scream projected by magic before sprinting towards Kulino. Large chunks of sand kicked up by her frantic running accompanied her as she tackled the crazed knight to the ground but he took the boys eye with him as he fell.  An eye that the boy could never get back.Kulino hadnt even landed on the sand before Rense had grabbed the dirk from his hand and slammed her shield onto his face.  Whispering just loud enough for him to hear her she continued while slamming her steel greatshield onto Kulinos face.  You may be undead she started her voice cracking with every word but undead can hollow eventually.A deep veil of blue coated Renses back coming from Ilitans apprentices rotted wooden staff.  Rense practically his mother had raised him from birth or the last ten years giving him everything he needed when Ilitan neglected him and now she was injured and bleeding out and it was all because of him.  It was because he wasnt competent enough for Ilitans standards that he was kicked out and sent to prove his worth at this tournament.  It was his fault that he hadnt stopped her from following him and it would be his fault if she died.  All of these thoughts sorrow sadness repulsion love and even hate filled his being as he pulled his staff back.  Something ripped at the boys soul pulling out piece after piece into the vortex of swirling light congealing at the tip of his staff.  The light grew brighter and brighter before the boy let out the loudest cry he could before sending a shock wave of energy flying through the air and towards the oncoming paladin.  A soul stream.  The paladins sword flew threw the air in the arc while the soul stream activated if the paladin could continue his attack the boy would surely die.,DarkSoulsRP,d723ifx,3,t5_3eukd
