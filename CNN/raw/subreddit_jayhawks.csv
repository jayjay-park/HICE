272308,0,t1_cf7ynxg,What makes you say that Seldens season is better than Henrys was? Xavier outperformed Wayne in basically every area of the stat sheet. That obviously doesnt prove that he was better than Wayne but it is a good indication.Check out their stats side by side ,jayhawks,cf8zheb,3,t5_2qnky

3476090,0,t1_cpo1upb,Thats not even really it... I mean it is better for them but thats not why it would be dumb to schedule them.  NonConference play is about  things Upping your RPI and extending your visibility to key recruiting demographics.   Now... is Wichita good for your RPI... sure the last  years but how long is that going to last?  Maybe Marshall has built himself a powerhouse here but in reality we are talking about a team that has only won its conference championship  of the last  seasons... and its not like theyre playing in a powerhouse conference.  If you look at KUs non conference they play a few softballs but  shoot for high caliber teams to boost their strength of schedule.  Especially this season  UK Georgetown Michigan State Utah and usually good though not so much this year Florida amp Tennessee.  Schools that year in and year out can be counted on as SOS boosters.  Then look at the other matches  UCSB SoCal... huge recruiting hot spot Ryder New JerseyNew York... recruiting hot spot Temple Philly... recruiting hot spot Lafayette... Lousiana... again hot spot.  So what exactly would playing WSU do for KU?  Nothing.  They already have the recruiting exposure in Kansas in  years when Marshall gets hired by a bigger budget school and WSU slides back to where they have spent the last  decades as a non factor in a non conference it wont help RPI.    And the same holds true the other direction... it really does nothing for WSU in the long run as far as improving the program other then maybe give them the shot at one televised game a year for recruiting purposes and if its you getting smoked by  its not gonna be great for that. ,jayhawks,cpoi03d,6,t5_2qnky

5671965,0,t1_cx051wp,Our D was some major cause for some concern in the first part of the game. And you could see it on Selfs face. He took them into the locker room and slapped them around and they responded. Its exciting to see how well they responded to his coaching. Most the recent teams weve had took a lot longer to start clickin. All of our guys gelled really well with each other. Its very exciting to see that we could have anyone on the court and still play as well. Grant it it wasnt a great team. But I see good things and early.  Real test Tuesday. ,jayhawks,cx05w2t,2,t5_2qnky

10614128,0,t3_5rv64i,I vote we quit giving any of this crap attention.  I read the KC star article and its horrible.  It seems as if they did absolutely no research almost like the girl who is stalking the team wrote the article herself. They could really ruin somebodies reputation by publishing unverified crap like this.,jayhawks,ddarltl,10,t5_2qnky
11055354,0,t1_del1yij,I would rather not play Witchita St. in my region if it could be avoided. UCLA and Virginia could be trouble. But honestly this team seems like its going to play most teams close and have proven over and over again that they can close. If Bragg can keep up what hes been doing and Svy can regain his shot I like our chances against anybody. ,jayhawks,del3thu,1,t5_2qnky
