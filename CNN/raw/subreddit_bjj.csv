16261,0,t3_1ua57n,Congrats.  Thats a big step.The next step is when you start to lose track of how many subs you get in a night because theyre not so rare anymore.Ive been training for  months now. My first sub came about  months in I started at  so similar age. I can still remember the sub and the place on the mat when I felt the tap. But now I can leave a sparring session and not remember who I subbed who subbed me and which matches just went the full time unless I stop and think about it.Of course there are still some subs I remember like the first time submitting a guy that just dominates you for months on end.,bjj,cegaa19,1,t5_2qn02

26981,0,t3_1ueq0h,I think it was a legit tap and the ref just wasnt paying attention.Holding a RNC after a guy goes out is not as bad as punching an unconscious person. I dont know who isnt complaining about knocked out people getting hit. In fact I think its just the opposite. I read more and more comments about how this ref is going to get someone killed.I think both are bad but if it was me Id rather you hold an RNC for an extra  seconds than punch me while Im out.But Id also rather you hold a RNC for an extra  seconds than a Paul Harris kneebar or any kneebar really for an extra  seconds ,bjj,cehi5p5,1,t5_2qn02

65020,0,t3_1us449,One thing mentioned to me by an upper belt was that if Im applying a submissionno matter how crappy the techniqueits my responsibility to listenfeel for the tap.  If my rolling partner is doing what hes supposed to physical or verbal tap its on me to catch it.Your situation is complicated by him throwing full forceno control submissions but ask himdoes he hearfeel the tap? If not he should recognize how hes endangering his training partners.I had something like this last week.  Applied an arm triangle slowly squeezed...but didnt hear or feel anything.  Squeezed more.  Partner was very lightly tapping the mat.  I didnt hear it and it was only the sound of him gurglingchoking that made me stop.

81359,0,t3_1v0np6,This is one of the concluding remarks of his talk and I do not beleive I took this out of context with the rest of his presentationIf we have these cultural responses from the Hells Angel to the Weekend Warrior and if my generation grew up with the WWF and the result is the most violentbrutal sport that we have whats going to happen with the next generation?I could go on about that statement alone and how its an unfair portrayal of this sportlifestyle.  I think the biggest issue I have with this is presentation is that it lumps the fans of MMA and MA with the participants and I think these are two separate things.  Yes you can be both a fan and a participant but I think the fan has a largely different look on MMA then the person who is training it and participating everyday.  I wont get into that now.I understand the need for graphic examples to strengthen his points and but if you are going to give a educated talk lets try to pull examples from all fields.  You should one form of MMA besides striking in all your examples which was a bloody BJ Penn your favorite fighter? putting a RNC on a bloody as hell Joe Stevenson.No wrestling takedown?  How about a awesome suplex?  Judo throw?  How about a really nice armbar does not need to be something extravagant like darce or Peruvian Neck Tie that no one would understand.  Any sweeps from bottom?  What about WMMA?  I agree with other arguments that this is a poor delivery as well.MMA includes so many different aspects and different Martial Arts and every Martial Arts has some level of personal exploration and self discovery that not every martial artist starts out with the intention with seeking but one that many who continue to partake in the MA often end up pursuing.  Yes I started BJJ and other MAs for very surface level reasons self defense or like you said some social status but that was quickly replaced with a need to pursue my own personal quest for self discovery.I mentioned it before but would your argument hold for womens MMA?,bjj,cenowqo,5,t5_2qn02

113797,0,t3_1vdzca,My favourite instructional BJJ book is Jiu Jitsu University. My favourite noninstructional book related to BJJ is probably Clyde Gentrys No Holds Barred. Im a fairly fast reader but I really relished that one its a history of MMA. I spent years reading up to a certain point in a chapter then watching all the relevant MMA events I owned on DVD that were discussed. Id then stop until I got some more MMA DVDs on birthdays and christmases. That meant I could reread the bit Id read before along with the section that covered my latest DVDs. Took ages to finish the book as a result but made it so much more enjoyable.More recently I thought Sam Sheridans A Fighters Heart is probably the bestwritten book related to BJJ Ive read so far. John Wills autobiographical Rogue Black Belt series at least the second and third I havent read the first as he wasnt training BJJ then was enjoyable too if rather less well written.,bjj,cerdzjq,7,t5_2qn02

119274,0,t1_ces0b5r,I mean I would hardly use the word unacceptable. He def messed up but you are being too critical to say he should not be a ref. It very much looks like a bicep slicer. I have seen wayyy worse calls by refs. Hes responsible for the angle and everything but he is just a human like the rest of us. Mistakes happen. If Im not mistaken they have no real measure to reverse a call. Its just whatever the ref says on the spot and thats it.

Your ability to not feel useless is going to be directly correlated to how often do you train and what the size of your gym is. If you train at a smaller gym where the majority have more experience than you youre probably going to feel useless for a while. If there are more people and the playing field is closer to level it wont take long. But there are levels of uselessness. Right now youre just getting killed. Pretty soon you wont be getting killed but youre going to be in crappyinferior positions. Once your defenses and escapes start to get up to par you might even find yourself on top.

353488,0,t1_cfhcr6d,I know Im just a bluebelt so Im sorry if this seems condescending. But this is a typical whitebelt problem. What youre describing is an aggressive side control which is open for attack. The more stable you want your sidecontrol to be. The more you have to follow the principles outlined by Joshvogel. I very very very seldom attack from sidecontrol. I only attack from sidecontrol when people make stupid mistakes or get careless in other ways. Most of the time I attack from mount or the back. Im a small guy. When keeping sidecontrol my preferred thing to do is   Grab the gi by the shoulder with the arm thats under his head to anchor myself to his head and keep the crossface.  Instead of the underhook I place my other hand by his hip. Not holding it. Not grabbing it. Just checking it so that if he moves his hip I can sense it and move with it. My hand is now a placeholder for the knee youre used to from the standard sidecontrol all whitebelts learn. I get on my toes knees off the ground. Both legs stretched out. My chest makes contact on the side of his chest. I dont want to be all the way on top. I want to be a little off to the side so that my weight is pushing into the side of his chest. Done correctly it feels almost impossible to escape toward me. This prompts the turning away escape which I anticipate and use to take the back or technical mount depending on how fast andor skilled they are obviously. If they simply stay put Ill move into more aggressive sidecontrol variations. There are lots of different ways to do that as well. As well as many other ways to hold sidecontrol. Even in kesa gatamescarfhold as mentioned in this thread as well keeping your arms butt and knees off the ground will help you put weight on the guy. ,bjj,cfhemsn,2,t5_2qn02

362060,0,t3_1y8gao,Another thing to keep in mind and equally as important as the type of soap you use is what you eat. Try to incorporate some greek yogurt Kefir or kombucha. The probiotics will help maintain a healthy ecosystem of good bacteria on your skin that will be your first line of defense when your exposed to harmful bacteria. In terms of soaps defense is really popular because it helps maintain a good skin ecosystem and not kill off healthy bacteria. The last thing you want to use is a harsh antibacterial soap. Most guys use Head amp Shoulders because its designed to combat dandruff which is a high level of a fungus called malassezia globosa without harming other skin bacteria. My advice is to stick with a healthy diet never wear a wet Gi or rash guards after training try to change clothes right after training and take a shower immediately when you get home. Also wash all your gear ASAP and regularly disinfect your gym bag if you use one some guys just wrap their Gi in a bundle or bring stuff in a plastic bag they throw out afterwards. Most guys that catch skin infections dont take any of this seriously and will roll in a dirty Gi for a couple of classes wont shower right away and have a horrible diet. ,bjj,cfiaklj,3,t5_2qn02

408604,0,t3_1yqysh,The best tip Ive heard is probably something you wont like... slow down.Guys that train  days a week at the very beginning are more likely to drop than guys who train  times a week.  There are a few reasons this might be the case here are the ones Ive seen Someone trains  times a week sometimes twice a day and suddenly they suffer a major injury.  Blown knee hernia something that takes them out for  months.  They rarely come back.  Some rationalize that if they suffered an injury their body will never be healthy enough to train.  Some realize just how much time and money they were spending on jiujitsu and how free their schedule is without it.  They get back to hanging out with friends and then dont want to give it up when its time to go back.  Either way they rarely return. Someone trains  times a week does a competition after  months and lose the first match in  seconds.  They get frustrated thinking if they train that much and cant be a champion they will never be good and quit.  Ive seen this happen way too often and its always sad when it does. Someone trains  times a week and then their significant other or friends and family start complaining all they do is train and they never hang out anymore.  They start feeling obligated to spend time hanging out then over time they realize how much they missed their personal life.  They have it in their head if they arent training  times a week then they arent going to get better and so rather than cutting down on classes and sticking with it they quit. And then we have the plateau.  Someone trains  times a week and they have a training partner who started around the same time but only trains  times a week but they arent twice as good as that other guy.  They dont understand why they arent so much better and they start to feel like they arent improving and get really frustrated which slows down their progress even more.  The thought gets into their head that even training every class they still cant be the best and quit.  This is probably the most common Ive seen.Ive talked to three seperate gym owners all running decent sized gyms and they all independently came up with what I posted above.Im not saying you cant train  times a week and stick with it for decades just that Ive seen more people stick around that train  times a week than ones that train more.Training  times a week gives you more time to recover more time to process what youve learned and more importantly more time to spend with your family and friends.,bjj,cfn49w4,10,t5_2qn02

482171,0,t1_cfu6k24,Thank you very much for posting that! He has some very interesting points. He does say at the end of the article that he is not saying to never use iceantiinflams which is good but throughout most of the article I instantly thought of many points to counter what he was saying.I would credit that to my field though. In my work there isnt an option most of the time to let the body take its natural course. Anything we can do to keep a person going is what we absolutely need to do.He did bring up RICE. Again situational but RICE is a great treatment method but I think people have a misconception regarding some of the letters. For example rest does not mean to sit on a couch and not do a single thing for a week. When I tell a patient to rest the injured limb an ankle for example I let them know that they shouldnt be hitting the gym doing dead lifts or attempting to run a marathon.Thanks again! ,bjj,cfv2qwz,1,t5_2qn02

497449,0,t3_1zru5x,As ugunslinger would say you do suck. Youve only trained six months in a sport that it takes about two years to obtain any meaningful rank in and about  years on average to master. And guess what? Thats okay. Because everyone sucks at six months unless theyve grappled previously and even then in their legitimate first six months of grappling they sucked too. To use a cliche jiujitsu is a marathon not a sprint. Maintaining mount longer than necessary to get your points in training does you no favors. As someone else said be active. Go to high mount and set up an ezekiel choke for when they roll you over. Go to Smount to set up an arm bar if you cant break their defense set up a triangle. Go to knee on belly. Go to side control. Go to northsouth. Submit or keep moving. Locking up triangles on bigger people is a bitch. This is a case where you really must grapple with your bones. Lock in a high guard first one arm in one arm out grab your shin and scoot back to work your elbow to your stomach creating a picture frame around their head and arm with your leg and arm then lock the triangle and cut the angle. Try feinting a move in the opposite direction of the sweep or a more elaborate setup or a setup in the first place if youre not doing onesweeps just like submissions need to be setup. This comes with time on the mat. You build up your own arsenal of techniques from each position that are your goto techniques and having those burned into your mind youre more free to try new stuff you just did in class. Your top and bottom games are equally important but as a white belt its kind of expected for your bottom game to develop at a much faster pace than your top game since thats where youll spend most of your time until you get a handle on sweeps. Fight for top but dont die on bottom. Learning which escapes that work for you and some bottom guards that keep your opponents weight off of you spider guard xguard shinonshinspider guard are probably going to be your saving graces.,bjj,cfwtars,2,t5_2qn02

507044,0,t1_cfxu9tj,I understand what you mean. So for the sweep you are describing you are putting yourself directly under his hips with one foot on his bicep and one foot on the ground correct? Do you lift him and bring him over your head like a tomo nage or more of standing up with the leg like an x guard sweep?I see what you mean about trying to bait the pass. Especially against bigger guys. The people that put me here are significantly bigger then me like almost  lbs. I dont have the issue with guys more my size because I either hit the sweep or I fail and im able to recover again by stretching him out like you said. When guys are bent over trying to pass standing I feel like I can move between dlh and spider and when they combat base I can do that too. Its when they are standing straight up and they are moving their hips close to me that I start to look for this as a sweep because I dont know how to stop the pass unless I turn myself out and stretch the arm. Id love to see the sweep you are talking about if you have a tutorial somewhere it sounds like the option im looking for.   ,bjj,cfxwjm7,1,t5_2qn02

Once youve got a good armbar youll find it from more positions.Edit my game is generally to pull guard look for a sweep at first if I can attack with an armbar thats what Ill do. Eventually a sweep will happen mostly butterfly sweeps. I take mount asap and threaten with an Americana if I can if they defend one way Ill attack the other arm and go for an armbar. If he turns to his side Ill jump on an armtriangle. If I can Ill take his back and go for a bow and arrow choke.

What helps more though is when youre standing and you can put your hips into a punch.

746252,0,t3_22ocan,How old are you? What is your recovery like? Are you functionally mobile? Can you easily touch your toes? Can you put your knees on the ground in a butterfly stretch? Any chronic injuries or muscle or postural imbalances? How naturally strong are you to begin with? What are your goalsto prevent injury or to use muscle to aid in high level competition? When it comes to exercise prescription no two people are the same nor do they have the same needs one size fits all is a myth. I do agree that once mobility is prioritized and handled the Wendler  is good for athletes especially older and with worse recovery ability because its very straight forward about your training volume. Its too easy for males to get sucked into some high volume bodybuilding style routine which can overly fatigue you and interfere with your sport your sleep and your life. So maybe try Wendler with very little additional assistance work I like to do pullups rollouts and TBar rows ignore the Boring but Big stuff and then set the maxes in your template deliberately low while you gauge what your body can handle.A lot of program design really depends on recovery. BJJ is taxing as are weights. Especially if you are an old fart a big dude or both. The bigger the muscle and body the longer it takes to recover. So if some people are lifting xweek and rolling xweek they might be  year old lightweights and that works for them because their bodies can handle it due to age and size. Or they might just have great testosterone levels or be excellent sleepers. The most important thing is to remember that we are athletes first and lifters second so fitness goals need to support lifehealth first BJJ second and then ego as a distant third. If youre lucky you wont have as huge of a lifting ego to overcome as I do so  and  will come to you naturally. Be very careful learning form if you have never done certain multijoint lifts like squat and deadlift before. Done right they will make you into a nearly indestructible tank. Done wrong well they will just do the destruction themselves!,bjj,cgp3sw9,1,t5_2qn02

791178,0,t1_cgu4mkb,Yeah. I have. One thing you have to do is figure out what you want out of jiu jitsu. For me I wanted an outlet to challenge myself. Boy did I pick a doosey. Naturally nonathletic way overweight slow injured and I picked BJJ... What the hell was I thinking. But whenever I get to feeling so pissed that I havent seen any progress I remember that I started this not to become the best at jiu jitsu. I started this to challenge myself as much as possible. Are there nights where I come in and get completely wrecked? Hell yeah. Those nights are in the majority. Do I let myself get down after those nights? Hell. No. If I try my hardest at something and cant do it well Im fine with that. If I dont try my hardest at something and fail at it I have to reevaluate why I am there in the first place. Despite what many people may tell you not all people are created equal. Deal with that and work your hardest. That is if you can get what you want out of jiu jitsu. ,bjj,cgu7lle,4,t5_2qn02

842757,0,t1_cgzxndb,White belt here. My coach taught me a halfguard passattack that so far Ive had quite a successful percentage with.Lets say your opponent has your right leg trapped in half guard.You would drop your left hip to the mat while still keeping body weight and pressure on his upper body and crossfacing in order to prevent the underhooksweep. You would then begin to push with your right hand on his kneethigh to slice your knee through to mount. This will bait himher into bringing hisher left arm over to prevent you from passing by pushing your knee back into his half guard. When heshe does this immediately snatch their arm and lock in a Kimura grip. This is where it gets a little weird so with your Kimura grip you transition to a single arm Kimura grip which is essentially instead of attaching your left hand to your right wrist you just reach over the shoulder and directly grab your opponents wrist leaving your right hand free. You can then use your right hand to break the lock on your right knee and then transition into mount. Now you can finish the one hand kimura you will already have locked pretty tight or work from mount.I tried explaining this to the best of my abilities I hope you can visualize what Im saying. Feel free to ask for clarification. Good luck.,bjj,ch02oo5,1,t5_2qn02
844756,0,t3_23sxd7,I recently returned to the Seattle area and decided to take up BJJ. Basically my thought process was simple  Whos the best in our area?  Can I go to their gym almost every day an hour drive to and another to come back can really kill the joy  Affordability.After reading reddit and a few other online sources it came down to GB and Marcelo Alonso gyms. Then I went to Revolution tourney website and looked up who takes st places as a gym consistently. Been going to GBKirkland for a month now and cant be happier supergreat and friendly instructors and team mates.Fun note when I was reading reddit I came across someone answering the very question you asked.

852896,1,t1_ch184ap,I wasnt trying to word it in a biased way if that happened it was my bad.NOTE  I have reworded that statement and made an edit remark for clarity.I guess my point is...dont we put certain limits on guard development if the mentality becomes never pull guard always fight to the takedown?Sure it doesnt prevent anyone from playing guard but it makes the guard a less desirable position right?I dont disagree with you on the rules.  If you want the rules to have some bearing on fight realities then I guess penalizing guard pulling makes sense?It seems like we have a bit of a divide there too...with some people suggesting that match rules should be set to enforce fight conditions such as a penalty for pulling guard...while others seem to embrace BJJ as a sport with its own rules that dont need to be dictated by a self defense POV.I appreciate your thoughts.Personally I think guard pulling is cool and fighting for the takedown is cool too.  Do what you like!  I just find it strange that people are trying very hard to stamp out guard pulling.  Why not let the guys who want to pull pull and let the positions on the podium sort it out?,bjj,ch189i0,0,t5_2qn02

Just like Judo has been making rule changes for more explosive exciting judo the IBJJF should look at making some rule changes to avoid this shit. Every time I see it I roll my eyes and turn it off. And unlike some of the rule changes in Judo I think prohibiting guardpulling would be beneficial for BJJ as a sport and as a martialartself defense. ,bjj,ch1jxe5,1,t5_2qn02

It involves trying to ensure that Im relaxed yet enthusiastic and I preemptively forgive myself for any mistakes. I personally need to focus myself on having fun and aiming for mental perseverance. Then I do my best to stay in that frame of mind no matter what. Sometimes my mind will wander to other aspects of the matchup e.g. gold medal match opponents strengthsexperience level how crappy it will feel to lose due to a stupid mistake etc. but I consciously bring myself back to those framing motivating thoughts.

Yes it still seemed like a far off dream and I felt like if I ever even reached blue belt Id be satisfied for life but black was always a realistic goal. The biggest trip of it is that I probably dont know a fraction of the jiu jitsu that you think I know. As a white belt black belts seemed like the magical creatures who could bend space and time and answer any question about any position. It sounds cliche but Im just that  year old white belt with a handful of thousands more mat hours. Theres so much I dont know its crazy.Just never stop training.

1048666,0,t3_2645lp,This is something that has been bothering me since class last night.  As a white belt of  months I have only had  legitimate taps against white belts and poorly survived against everyone else so I have very little experience in holding someone in a submission.  Last night we were drilling triangle escapes at about  speed and I slowly locked in a triangle until it was deep and my partner couldnt really escape.  It was really tight and he continued to try to escape but never tapped.  The drill clock rang and we stopped but I had held him in a red faced triangle for about  seconds while tried to escape and he seemed fine with everything and we joked around after but was my holding it a dick move?  Once we stalemated and his escapes werent working should I have released and reset?  Again this is coming from someone with virtually no experience being on the delivering end of a submission.

The other issue you may run into is the ref misinterpreting whats going on. This happens more often than youd think e.g. DQing people for perfect baratoplatas thinking its a slicer. If your opponent is a douche he might also claim it was a slicer. My advice is to talk to the ref beforehand so he knows what youre planning to do. A good ref will let you demonstrate it to prove its not a slicer. ,bjj,cht2c0l,5,t5_2qn02

1159381,0,t3_27dsyp,I am a sport BJJ guy.  I dont care about self defense.  I never have I never will.  All of the self defense stuff in my eyes is stuff against a person playing with rules.  As an adult I have never been in any situation that required some crazy knife defense to get out of unscathed.  If I just try to not act like a total jerk and be careful about where I am and what Im doing it seems to all work out allright.  I am quite happy to enjoy a sport with guys looking to do the same thing.  Go out on the mats work hard learn some cool moves and try to be better tomorrow than we were yesterday.  Ive learned a lot from the relationships Ive built in the sport and learned a lot about how hard I could push myself how much I could take and how far you can come if you are willing to put in hours of work week in and week out for years on end.urand hit the nail on the head for me.  Rolling with brand new people can often be the hardest because they dont react in a way that most people with bjj training do.  I find a lot of the Royce guys in my area are really big on the self defense stuff because thats what hes having his coaches push.

1160179,0,t3_27ef4m,My cardio isnt amazing or anything but its pretty good. Certainly at the beginning of this year I was ahead of quite a lot of guys in particular some of the oldier heavier guys who arent in great shape.It got that way through a series of brutal early morning training sessions involving huge numbers of burpies. I absolutely use it when I can. The way I see it Im not the biggest or the best but if I can keep pushing the pace to give myself an advantage thats a legit part of the roll. When some guy has kgs on me and uses that weight to help pin me from mount thats a big problem for me so I dont feel bad about using a fast scrambly pace to try and gas the same guy out.This only really applies to other white belts and some blues theres not a whole lot of point in trying to gas out a purple belt of whatever age because he can just shut me down with technique.Use what you got. You dont always have to try and run your opponents into the ground  youre there to learn and experiment not collect taps  but you also dont need to throw your cardio and wrestling experience out of the window just because they dont have it. Look at it this way If they keep gassing theyre getting fitter from pushing themselves and youre also helping them by exposing a hole in their game.I do see your point about wanting to get an entire roll in but Im sure these guys will improve their stamina andor learn to slow the roll down with grips and so on.,bjj,ci04zj0,1,t5_2qn02

What I think should happen is irrelevant this started as a result of wondering why cops dont get departmental training in Grappling.As for my opinion yes a taser is preferable to aggressive contact for a NONCOMPLIANT suspect.  If they are already laying down hands behind waiting for cuffs then there is no reason to Taser them.  There is also no reason to grapple them either.Now if they become violent during the cuffing as some do and the officer has to defend themselves then grappling comes into play as does the taser.

The first portion is a series of moves with a Uke to demonstrate technical knowledge side mount escapes mount escapes combinations etc.... The second part of the test is live rolling. Its about demonstrating skill level for the appropriate belt. One poster indicated RD gives students openings which he does to see if the student can spot the opportunity and take advantage...this is true. Also rolling with RD comes after the demonstration portion up to  minutes of demo then rolling live with three or four other students.

It is essentially the perfect complement for BJJ  it tackles the exact problem areas that are most common in BJJ spine neck shoulders hips... well basically all joints while correcting imbalances improving endofrangeofmotion strength and focusing on breath work.  In other words it will go a long way toward sustaining and improving your health and longevity in BJJ while likely improving your BJJ at the same time.  I feel strongly that every Jiu Jitsu practitioner should be doing at least a little Yoga but the more the better.That said I second the others in this post who have suggested clean food certain joint supplements and weight training.  When you go into the weightroom just make sure you are training for the right reasons  you could step in there to lift heavy and get big which can be destructive on the body as well and doesnt gel well with the rigors of constant BJJ training or you could step in there with the intent of preventing injury i.e. prehabilitation and when necessary rehabilitation.  Youll gain strength in either way but the former is an end to itself while the latter is more supporting of health and of other efforts namely BJJ.,bjj,cien1yh,4,t5_2qn02

The one time I let him pass my guard so I could work on escaping he goes right to north south and starts neck cranking me with a very poorly applied darce choke. I was going easy and figured if tap early to avoid an injury we get up and he starts lecturing my about the escape. I just smile and nod trying not to be rude and proceeded to SMASH him right after that. Last week we were drilling headlock escapes and I was unlucky enough to get partnered up with this tool.

For starters try not to leave your neck exposed or your arm out to the side or out in front.

I have the same issue but normally if I keep trying and letting techniques fail I can use the techniques as stepping stones to move to the next one. If I play really conservative maybe I keep my position longer but he doesnt have to defend anything except the first attempt.

1484234,0,t3_2b6kx8,Ive had some knee problems and I especially feel them when I have a triangleheavy day and the next day is brutal.  My main advice would be to keep looking for triangles but dont FORCE them.  If you can throw on a tight triangle with a nice angle and all go for it.  But if you know that this triangle attempt is going to force you to really strain your knees to break their posture and youll have to fight to get their arm across and youre having trouble shoulderwalking back because theyre stacking so well well...give it up.  Work on transitioning from that position to an omoplata or armbar or if youre really worried about the pressure on your knee just give up the pass and start over from side control bottom.  Its nice to win in training but the health of your knees is more important.  Keep your triangle game fresh by snapping on the tight quick ones you get but save your knees by giving up a little earlier on the tough ones.  Just my two cents.,bjj,cj2bof8,2,t5_2qn02

Im usually just the dummy for the head kids coach at our gym but the last two weeks I was left in charge and I actually typed up a lesson plan for each class with warm ups a technique based game and two moves to teach. Last week we focused on tightening up their side control this week we started working on guard passing into side control and knee on belly.Our technique based games used medicine balls to smooth the transition from side to kesa gatame and back to side and for knee on belly I had them practice the knee on belly posture but without a body under them and whoever did it longest without falling over will be getting a surprise next week.amp really it wasnt that hard to come up with things that flowed together either.

Positive reinforcement has the highest response rate of CR condition response that can be reduced to the lowest amount of USUnconditioned stimulus with the longest extinction period. It is just a superior method of altering or strengthening a behavior. Not that it cannot be assisted by other behavioral conditioning but if you arent even using PR then you certainly shouldnt be using positive punishment.Positive punishment is by the way what we are talking about. Negative reinforcement means removal of an aversive stimulus. Positive punishment is the addition of an aversive stimulus.,bjj,cjattil,5,t5_2qn02

I mainly wear spats for compression and injury prevention in particular a niggling groin injury that causes issues every now and then hence why I almost always have spats on under gi trousers in gi class unless its stupid hot. However I also like the reduction in friction for me at least Ive heard some people wear them to increase friction. It is almost certainly just my imagination but I feel like I flow better in spats. If I have shorts on top of the spats that ups the friction and also gets uncomfortably hot in my experience.,bjj,cjqrx08,1,t5_2qn02

The only way youll improve and get better is if you keep going to class.The things that I write down are basically how to do a particular technique step by step. Thats what helps me the most. I also take note on what I should work on by input from my rolling partner.

1815330,0,t1_ck7wshm,Damn. Im a teacher so it bugs me when I cant transfer info. So okay here goes. Gonna get step by step here. You are on your side with your opponents knees on either side of your head. Your opponent has a figure four on your top arm. You have your hands gable gripped together. Take your feet and extend them downwards getting a good grip on the floor. Take your forearms and place them on the thigh that is in front of your face. Just enough to assist in squeezing your head out of the space your head is in. Now at this point you should still be on your side legs reaching at a downwards orientation to your body forearms ready to bracepush off. Now use your feetlegs like a reverse shrimp shrimping from side to back traveling downwards and pull your head out from between their knees. Now if we are walking through this at this point you are on your back and the top person probably still has your arm gripped in a figure four. Now start to rotate your body by swinging your legs towards the side that they have an arm grabbed on. Stay on the small of your back while spinning. Do not turn on your side. As you spin you should be able to bend the bottom leg in sliding your knee in between you and your opponent who will still have you gripped and take your other leg and throw it over their face. Youll need to hip up and into this to make it effective and tight as you apply the armbar.,bjj,ck7xh0i,2,t5_2qn02

Now there are only one or two of the really aggressive guys who obviously avoid rolling with her but she doesnt take it personally because there are lots of other good partners for training.

2081319,0,t3_2ipt9k,The same reasons as the guysfun a good social hobby thrill of competition getting in shape personal development and selfdefenseoffense if studied seriously and coupled with other disciplines and physical conditioning.As a female that has been raped I would never recommend it for rape or sexual assault defense specifically. edit I mention this as a response to a now downvoted commentThe reason being that most perpetrators are known to their victims and are trusted by them. That means that most victims are inherently taken surprise by the attack on some level. It is hard to understand in that moment that you are actually being attacked because it is so deeply counter intuitive that someone would use sex so deeply associated with love and intimacy as a weapon of control. That is why crushing selfblame is very common in rape victims regardless of gender it makes more sense to believe youve done something wrong than that someone else would use sex as a weapon against you.The confusion is way too deep I think for most people to be willing to use their skills against their attacker in that situation. Moreover most people just arent willing to hurt someone they trust. It is easy to imagine trying to fight a stranger or someone that punches you. Someone that could be construed as wanting to be with you intimately? No. It just isnt going to happen for most people. Can you imagine being motivated to kill or beat your girlfriend or boyfriend? Your best friend? No? Then you probably arent going to slap a triangle on a rapist if your time should ever come. The consequence of marketing grappling specifically as rape defense is that victims will just have more ammo to blame themselves I could have stopped it it is all my fault needlessly. Now there are always those special people in that specific circumstance that manage to respond with appropriate violence. That is great. I just dont think it wise to expect or create the expectation that most people would be able to use grappling or any other martial art successfully because a lot of evidence points to it not being so due to lack of will or freezing.FWIW shrimping and hip escape helped me. That was all the physical resistance that I was both physically and mentally capable of mounting in my defense against my attacker.Edit clarity,bjj,cl4dqkh,25,t5_2qn02

2091867,0,t3_2iv08k,As much as I would love to see BJJ practitioners get paid at Worlds Vitor really has no business sense and kinda needs to shut it. I dont know if he realizes it but the reason some other sports offer such high salaries or rewards for world championships because of the fact that they are SPECTATOR SPORTS. There is such a demand to view it and be involved you can charge a premium and pass some of this along to your competitors which will thus increase the overall quality of the comp.. yadda yadda. Frankly most BJJ matches are incredibly boring  and the general public isnt going to sit around and watch something it already doesnt understand. dont get me wrong  I think events like Metamoris and general advances in technology have helped ease viewers into BJJ but it is still kinda blandAdditionally if you really wanted a professionally ran organization with payouts you would need some type of commission  overseeing body  NOT IBJJF  that would handle EVERYTHING. From payouts to disputes over matches which are now worth . This isnt like the ADCC  Abu Dhabi Pro stuff where you just go and graciously get paid  you would have to run this as a professional organization. Wrestling and other combat sports have been around for centuries with no payout for being the best per se though I think USA Wrestling now pays k if you win an olympic gold medal.. which... you know isnt hard or anything. I know there may be some instances where there have been payouts  but go look at any wrestler  they are broke. BJJ is relatively new and while extremely practical and obviously dominant in self defense... it would need a huge concentrated push by the community as a whole to get this type of thing going. And at the end of the day Vitor couldnt compete anyways since he would get popped for them roids...for those who are wondering IBJJF is directly linked with Gracie Barrathe Gracie family is a forprofit org and would be and technically currently is a huge conflict of interest.,bjj,cl5q0nw,32,t5_2qn02

2291145,0,t3_2lfdvh,Honestly I was obsessed with pro wrestling as a kid and particularly interested in chain wrestling. Good chain wrestling guys are essentially flow rolling with opponents and  of the techniques they use are catch or BJJ moves already. I would seek out independent leagues where the less muscular guys who would never make it in the WWE for business reasons would wrestle. Many of these guys were incredible at chain wrestling and even some guys in the WWE who came from these leagues...Daniel Bryan being one guy Ive seen live a few times and CM Punk being another. I initially wanted to be a pro wrestler and to use a submissionoriented stretcher type style. When the ugliness of the pro wrestling business and the lack of money involved became more clear to me as I aged I started thinking about training for and competing in the other love I had held since my early teens in MMA. It wasnt until I was  that I bumped into a friend of a friend in a Full Contact Fighter track jacket and asked him where he trained. I showed up for BJJ the next Monday and other than for college havent stopped since.So yeah MMA ended up being the thing that brought me to the door but it was pro wrestling that made me fall in love with submission wrestling in the first place. Soon after taking up BJJ I decided I really didnt want to compete in MMA and loved the science of BJJ more than anything. My real goal now is to learn as much as possible and teach one day.,bjj,cluwgzk,5,t5_2qn02

2309955,0,t3_2loadt,I know its hard but in my opinion you have to completely forget about the color of your belt or the colors of your opponentsteammates belts. It just seems like such a negative thing. You need to scientifically analyze the weak points in your game and turn them into strengths at all times. Push yourself to the limit and then move beyond those limits. Immerse yourself in the science of the art and why the techniques work. And if while you are doing this a lower belt taps you during a sparring session big deal happens all the time.I do think a belt promotion is a good kick in the ass to work even harder though.,bjj,clx85z1,1,t5_2qn02
2310318,0,t1_clx978l,gtThose are the guys who wont ever become black belt world champs.Most black belt world champs were also world champs in the lower belts. Most of them have sandbagged thats just how it is in high level BJJ its been like that for a long time. If you go to a local tournament yes I agree with you there is no pride in beating those guys. But when you go to the Worlds for example you are gonna face other sandbaggers as well as I said before. Thats the name of the game. You are sandbagging to beat the other sandbaggers not to beat the average Joe...If you are a blue belt world champ its definitely time to move to purple IMO but there are plenty of examples of blue belts who are x world champs.gtYou gotta fucking push yourselves.

But before that even as early as college they were using unorthadox techniques. For example Dave is very commonly known for defending his single legs with a arm lock kimura and then rolling people Sakraba like and it worked against the elite. Mark broke a guys arm in the olympics with it and then got dqed with it.

2425218,0,t1_cmbgi7t, for s hair.Good posture good grip fighting. You keep trying that snapdown you should try to combo the snapdown into a single leg pick.LOL Opponent DETERMINED to get that berimbolo...Ok REEEEWWIIIND! Aight at  seconds you cant get suckered into trying to run away from berimbolo. Youre in the right position to fight it and get the pass but you stand up and give up your control. From where you are you need to turn your right knee out hard to pop his hook free then drive your right knee to the mat near his shoulder. Standing up screws you. You lose all ability to control your opponent. Good job threatening the triangle when he rolls up though. Aight at  you should probably give up on the idea of single leg X and switch to halfguard control and try to work towards full X guard. Swinging your right leg down hard to trap his right leg would likely have given you a chance to generate a sweep.AAAnd more chances to get to Xguard thrown away like so much trash. Do you hate Marcelo Garcia? Did he kick your puppy? Bang your mom?At  you should have been fighting to get to X you had opportunities there and didnt go for them. From there its all down hill. You catch quarter guard but your opponent has all the pressure and grinds right through it. You try to turtle and he snags the Kimura and its game over.Aight I thought I saw something at the beginning so I jumped back to check it out. At  after your opponent pulls guard you have grips on his sleeves and neck and shit switch your grips to his PANTS. Control the limbs closest to you.,bjj,cmbgq97,2,t5_2qn02

2430764,0,t3_2nbmvk,Essentially if you want to play open guard youre going to have to learn an open guard. For most if not all open guard play you need to have some sort of pushpull mechanism that allows you to control the distance between you and your opponent. If you cant control the distance you wont be able to get your opponents base compromised enough to execute a sweepsub. And youll get passed. A lot.IMO white belt is a fine time to learn an open guard. Youre more likely to have people in an open guard than a closed guard in your jiu jitsu career so why not learn how it works now?If you really dont want to tackle an open guard then maybe shooting to a bottom half guard would be a good option. EDIT Some details in my response were geared toward gi which is what I assumed you were talking about. The general premise is the same for no gi but its generally more difficult. Tbh in no gi I prefer half guard butterfly or a guard in which theres much less distance for me to manage bc there are fewer opportunities for grips.,bjj,cmc5e2d,1,t5_2qn02

2453286,0,t3_2nmki0,It is tricky. Some people are not terribly selfaware even the best of them can still not realize when they are getting more competitive. This is sometimes compounded by the fact that higher belts sometimes have worries about doing poorly against lower belts. Its also FURTHER complicated by the fact that certain styles are just really poorly suited for dialing down. Its hard to say Toreondo just realize I have no idea how to spell this pass lightly. Id have faith that most people who are worth keeping friendships with understand that matching pace isnt exact and can sometimes mismatch. Try to be friendly humble and helpful. The kind of people who are going to get way upset over something that is an accident or worse their own fault arent worth bothering with anyway. ,bjj,cmexgo3,3,t5_2qn02

It makes it really painful to maintain the lockdown when you sprawl hard.Another way is to lift their lockdown with both of your feet separate the lockdown from the leg that it is being applied on and swivel that leg to the side and hide it in regular half guard.That probably made no sense unless youve seen a video of it though...As for the actual sweep heavy heavy shoulder pressure on the face keep your base very low keep your legs away from them so they cant shoot under you and sprawl when you feel them trying to whip your legs over.That being said someone with a strong lockdown who knows how to use it well will probably still sweep you.,bjj,cmirx5g,3,t5_2qn02

For me as a lawyer this really highlights how little most people know about the crim justice system and how much the media race baits and sensationalized everything.

2634251,0,t1_cn29614,Im a firm believer in getting the fundamentals down really well before trying out the more advanced stuff so I think what youre doing is on point. I was just giving you an idea of what I like to do as a person with a similar body type. I think inverting is important because it really helps with guard retention and recovery and because it makes it easier to get under and move around under longerbigger people. It helps me move more fluidly and to keep my momentum instead of having to stop and turn. Again maybe this isnt something you want to invest too much time into right now if you dont feel comfortable with it but I would recommend you keep it in mind. Im actually not as big a fan of side control just because it feels like an uphill battle battling against longer peoples frames stiff arms etc. but thats just something I have to work on. I like the mobility that knee on belly gives me and the control I can get from mount. Its often harder for long legged people to really get their legs out from under me for a shrimp escape or to hook my leg for an UPA like ucerebralonslaught said. Now that you mention it I need to revisit my closed guard. Its been pretty crappy lately. If you feel really comfortable in closed guard maybe you could work on arm drags? Good back taking and sweeping options from there and relatively safe.,bjj,cn2fi74,2,t5_2qn02

This is about the second half of every class. Implicit drilling and working shopping of technique for me that has been private lessons and working with higher belts in class in a looser structure asking them questions about specific positions I get stuck in or general advice on how to control a position or strategy. This is great for adding dimension to techniques Ive already been taught but never fully understood or could employ fluently.

2738702,0,t3_2rey73,Ive done a few sub only tournaments Ive done well in them. Never actually gotten subbed just had one match go to a draw.Ive found both in my matches and from watching others that there are a LOT of people that go out there planning to use that full  minutes and  start the match like a friendly roll. If you go out there aggressive you can and will catch these guys badly offguard and end up with a quick sub especially if youve got good standup. At the very least Id much rather expend a little more energy and be the guy in side control than the guy who won the guardpulling dance.Is a ten minute roll in which youre trying to conserve your energy the whole time for the hypothetical next rounds really any more tiring than one where you just go for it? Unless you surprise them eventually the intensity is going to ratchet way up someone gets close to a sub and now youre in the same place you wouldve been anyway except you were rolling light for  minutes already. And having a gameplan based on conserving energy sounds a lot like playing to not lose to me.The flipside? What if the other guy is aggressive too and now youre both just expending a lot of energy? Well he wouldve done that anyway so at least youre matching him out of the gate instead of having to mentally adjust after he steamrolls you and takes better position because you started soft.tldr I dont think the you have  minutes take it slow strategy is a good one and Ive had a lot of success by staying aggressive ,bjj,cnfdn69,2,t5_2qn02

2851081,0,t3_2sq8zm,Just an idea once or twice go to a class that is quite long and has a lot of time for rolling at the end.  keep yourself fresh and wait till one of the last rolls when he is tired as it sounds that he uses his strength a lot.  If you can get the better of him once or twice he may give you more respect in the future even if you can just hold him off and he cant catch you with anything. But  lbs is a huge advantage.  otherwise just try to make it to more classes and improve quicker than him. You could also just think of it in a different way when you roll with him you are improving your game more than he is improving his as you have to use technique more so who cares how many times he taps you.  When you guys go to compete in your own weight classes you will probably do much better than him and you can shove that in his face when he gets arrogant.,bjj,cns61t1,1,t5_2qn02

2878087,0,t1_cnuw982,He might train something but it might just all be drills and no live sparring.  I had somewhat similar experience with Shotokan karate in college. I had a pretty roundhouse kick but I wouldve gotten killed in a fight. A few times we had guest instructors that would actually let us non black belts point spar and I felt I learned a ton more than any other class not that drills are useless but that sparring is also vital. I didnt fully realize the importance of sparring until I started BJJ.Ive heard that Shotokan was designed by Funakoshi as a striking supplement for Judo guys as a result he specifically left most grappling out despite the fact that old school Okinawan karate had it. He left in a few takedowns that come up often in striking situations like osotogari which you will see often in point tournaments. I think Lyoto Machida has largely disspelled the theory that karate cant be useful for fighting. However the way its taught in most schools these days is really not targeted or tested for selfdefense applications which is an issue thats starting to arise with BJJ as well.,bjj,cnv8nkj,5,t5_2qn02
2878877,0,t3_2sy2p9,Im around your height and weight  lbs  rulershaped and wear a Fenom gi in A. After shrinking it fits pretty well. Id say its a regular fit  not so baggy that its ridiculously easy for people to grab material but not so slim that they cant.  Here are some pictures of my gi when I first got it  front side It looks pretty overwhelmingly large  but my bf assured me it would shrink down a lot. Here is a picture of me after training in it for  months Im on the far right if you want a better picture I can take one later when I get home. You can see what I mean about the regular fit. I think the sleeves and pants shrunk by  inches in length. The girl in the A Fuji gi my second choice to my left is about  lbs and her gi is much baggier. Im glad I went with the Fenom as my first gi.  Honestly I feel like youre overreacting here. I think a lot of us have body types that make us fall into the I cant find a gi that fits! camp but it doesnt mean that we go and disparage the company in social media when it happens.

2943986,0,t3_2tu0lk,Ive had similar problems from going from running to Jiu Jitsu. It exacerbated an ankle injury I had from years before. Heres two exercises that might help. If you spend any time sitting during the day in an office or in front of the TV take a towel and put in flat under your bare feet and practice scrunching it up with your toes. You can do this without a towel of course. Just practice using your toes to clench and drag.. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart then point your toes together to make a broken V. Then practice going up on your toes and back down as slowly as possible. Feel free to use a wall to balance but work towards being able to do this without a wall.I get physiotherapy free through work and have had to use it for elbow ankle and back injuries due to my extracurricular activities. I cant tell you all the science behind why this worked for me but I know it did. Hope this helps!,bjj,co2qtau,2,t5_2qn02

2945489,0,t1_co19k7y,I would seriously consider referring to a dietitian nutritionist or a personal trainer about your caloric intake. Doctors usually take a grand total of one class on nutrition during their entire grad school and usually are not well versed on sports nutrition or athletics. Im not saying your doctor doesnt know what hes talking about or that you wont gain weight from eating more you will. What Im saying is that you need to adequately consume what you exert in the gym and should probably do something like lifting to create more permanent calorie burning stores in your body. Theres a misconception that eating less and doing more cardio will make you lose weight or that lifting will make women look like a man. Cardio and diet will certainly make you lose weight but most times you will plateau and never achieve the body you are looking for. I think with the proper guidance eating more and training the right way will actually make you lose weight in the long run. That being said I dont know what your body type is or what your athletic situation is so maybe I should just leave this argument alone. Ive had this conversation so many times because I used to be the same exact way and now that Ive realized the error in my ways it frustrates me to see others do the same.,bjj,co2wz4w,1,t5_2qn02

3025636,0,t3_2ut8du,Counter their grips with grips. As soon as their hands come to your knees your hands need to be getting some kind of control on them ideally before they even get any control on your knees. If they control your pants at the knee and put you on your back then you are well on your way to getting passed if you arent able to bring your grips into play. Collar drags sleeve grips and lassosspiderx will slow them down if you can establish those. DLR style pants grip and off balance them by pushing their thighs and hips with your legs. If you get past your knees with your hands completely disengaged they will likely complete the pass.

That means I should be a black belt amirite?Nevermind the fact that the black belt I was rolling with let me get the position and then the submission and pretty much broke it down step by step as we were rolling how to finally get that submission. I still tapped a black belt.Ugh. WTF. I havent even been training very long Im absolute shite but even my dumb ass has learned enough from the people I train with that in order to learn new things and progress one must try new things and fail.

I found that first fighting off the under hook to be the first line of defense.Then engaging the hips and core while shoulder walking away from them will loosen their underhook and Ill try to wizzer their underhook to get in that attack position hopefully working to get the cross lapel grip. key detail wizzer arm stays on your chest in a armlockstraight ankle lock position. Hand flat on your chest with your thumb pointing at you. This keeps the wizzer grip as tight as possibleThe above coupled with side to side hip movement butt walking to adjust for their attempt to move and put pressure on your hips and legs to open your guard. So far these combinations have been successful in thwarting their advance. One guy the black belt there whos  x and lbs has been successful in advancing with this guard pass.

If youre only a few pounds under the next one up try to bulk up and whatnot but just getting fat to be heavier isnt going to help you.

If I hold my opponent by one arm only Ippon Seoi Nage style or grab the belt with one hand its Hikikomi Gaeshi. If I use the standard armlapel grip its Sumi Gaeshi.Nowadays theres a number of more or less odd competition variants of each and the lines between them blurr a lot. Along comes someone with some half assed knowledge of technique names and classifies it as whatever heshe thinks it is.This popular technique linked above for exampleThe clip says yoko sumi gaeshi ...

Not just in the UFC but for women fighters i know a lot of people started to take up Judo because of Ronda and weve had a surge of women taking classes who all say its because of Rowdy  Are we heading towards a bigger martial arts craze than the s had when bruce lee ruled? up until  years ago very few people i knew had a clue what MMA was now everybody knows about it i keep seeing it in movies celebrities not only talk about it but are taking classes i hear about it on the news Bruce Buffer alarm clocks.

I have a weaksmall bladder dont know the proper term all i know is i have to urinate frequently and have never gone through a class without having to take a piss. Im almost  years old I have to raise my hand and ask my coach if I can use the potty? Every  min? Every day? Seems a bit ridiculous.     No coaching other students during class I assume this applies toward sparring at the end of class or during randori sessions. I often give my friendsteammates advice if they are nearly passed or nearly finished a sub or nearly swept. I am banned from altruistically helping my teammates?     Talking kept to a minimum and relate to class subject Unless this is one of those its a rule but not a rule things it just sets the mood for an uptight atmosphere. What kind of atmostphere is it where I have to hesitate about simply opening my mouth to speak for fear of whether or not sensei will find it unsuitable for inside the school doors?    White uniform No grey Gis its silly but ok. No orange Gis same. But no royal blue Gis? God damn. So uptight and financially a burden to an experienced student who has primarily blue or black Gis and wants to enroll in AOJ selling all his Gis at a loss     Absolutely no other affiliation patches I mean I know you dont want to advertise other schools but this is absolutely overkill.

To start off I highly recommend starting with the Overhook.  There are a ton of attacks you can do from there.  If you go to www.bjjcollective.com and click on Closed Guard its on the top row then under Bottom Dominant Clinches click on Overhook should be on the second to top row.Heres a few moves you can do from there.Note make sure you use the nonhooking arm to clamp down on the back of your opponents neck to keep them from slipping out of the overhookAnother subposition you could try is the Forearm Lock,bjj,coywzu5,2,t5_2qn02

3334288,0,t3_2yc28w,I hate the gi with a passion. It will be hell trying to adapt. It will take a lot of dedication to get used to. Gi chokes are a lot tighter too than normal ones. Its just a case of gritting through and building up.I genuinely hate having to wear a suit of handles as it almost feels like cheating when someone can grab a loose bit and stop you moving forward. Thats my opinion.,bjj,cp8c2a4,3,t5_2qn02

3383254,0,t3_2yxdol,Id say Im most excited about the upcoming tournaments this year in the following order ADCC Polaris  Mundials Metamoris EBI  and then Pans. Abu Dhabi is always awesome and Ive been watching it since well before I started training mostly due to the MMA crossover. Polaris has the right approach to submission only superfights and is my current favorite promotion. The worlds are just too big to ignore and its the showcase for the top gi players which I prefer over nogi. Metamoris and EBI are both fun and use the subonly format that I prefer.Copa Podios May th finale is also right up there but the season format kind of puts it in a different category. Their production is great but I do wish they tried a bit harder to appeal to the English speaking crowd. Still the match between Moraes who is one of the rare Relson team guys doing high profile competitions and Gregor Gracie has me pumped.Pans has a couple divisions Im eager to watch and Im interested to see who takes the open but it does feel a bit overshadowed this year. A lot of exciting top prospects and established guys are competing so itll be good and most years it would be a bigger deal but this is an awesome year to be a fan of submission grappling and the other promotions have stolen a bit of the thunder.,bjj,cpdx0rq,1,t5_2qn02

3446605,0,t1_cpkt5rb,Thanks for reading amp posting! Of course I understand your point. I recognize the limitations here and as others have said my intention was never to draft a scientific paper to publish. If I were to do that Id probably want to sample from basically all the videos I could find then toss them into a randomizer to pull out  of them and have a panel of  also random or pseudorandom most actual scientific studies use college undergraduates which are hardly representative of the general public people assess whether the fight hit the ground at any point and whether grappling experience could have affected the fight in any regard.As its only  fights it actually wouldnt be too hard for me to produce a full list. I chose from HOT on rstreetfights last night around pm PST rather than TOP to try to minimize the likelihood of particularly exciting fights being selected. Furthermore that sub loves big brawls and I dont think they particularly want to see great torreandos so I think if anything its selected AGAINST in this particular analysis.If you have any further concerns let me know and Ill try to address them but the bottom line is that this isnt a professional metaanalysis for publication its  hours of wasted time to get a rough estimate at how often street fights end up on the ground especially in cases where there was obviously no individual possessing takedown knowledge.Cheers ,bjj,cpl50ou,2,t5_2qn02

We have a relatively small core consisting of a couple purples a couple blues and about  active whites. It is tough to gauge how much I am learning and applying because there is no one my size and current skill level so although sometimes I might catch a purple it is normally due to my size not my technique.

3473474,0,t3_2zzeje,Here is what has been working for me.  You must not let him dominate you with sleeve andor collar grips.  This is HUGE because of what those grips will do to your posture.  If your posture is broken in DLR you are fucked..  I always work to get to the Headquarters Position as shown by Saulo here  .  Once I stabilize in the HQ position I have just two basic passes that I use unless the guy goes to sit up guard which is a different problem to solve.Pass   Knee cut pass.  I pressure into his DLR leg turning my legfoot out and pressing down on his knee with a pants grip until his DLR hook pops out.  From there I dive my hand into the space between his arm and his ribs taking the underhook.  I then step wide over his other leg with my head next to his head and I execute a low knee cut pass.MLJR shows it here starting at   For that pass  If you cant get the underhook you can use a cross collar grip and flare your elbow up high under his chin which will put NASTY pressure on his jaw and force him flat.  If you cant get under the jaw you can still use that cross collar grip but post your elbow on his shoulder and use that to flatten him out as you knee cut.  Pulling up hard on the nearside sleeve is also very helpful.Pass   X pass.  Same setup I get to HQ smash the DLR leg and then step over into the X pass.  My trigger for this pass is if they let go of the ankle or if I cant get the underhook or collar grip to start the knee cut pass.  You can do this pass even if they have the ankle but you have to kick like a mule HARD straight back to break the grip and then elevate the leg over his nearside leg.  Its tricky I had to drill it a lot before it started working.Here is JT showing this passSIT UP guard Because a TON of people I train with use the sit up guard its a staple technique of my lineage I have two passes that I use for this guard.If they want to play the situp guard I like to block their situp with my shoulder reaching over their back and then longstep pass here is MLJR showing that passThe other pass is from the video I already linked I drive them down onto their back I use a stiff arm on the far shoulder to help with this its just what works for me and then switch directions to the knee cut,bjj,cpo79j7,3,t5_2qn02

3494096,0,t1_cpqjjok,Thats not what Im saying. Im saying that conceding the top position is inherently giving your opponent a mechanical advantage so giving them an advantage on the scorecard is fair. I think competition scoring should heavily encourage top position because fighting heavily favors top position. After the match hits the mat the normal scoring system already addresses this by giving points for the positional progression. Pulls are the only thing remaining that havent been addressed by the scoring system so thats why people have opinions on them giving your opponent points. Im more in favor of the advantage but other guys would rather you give up points to the opponent. Disagree with them winning back an advantage from guard shouldnt be hard if you had any business pulling in the first place.,bjj,cpqjvoc,1,t5_2qn02

3525896,0,t1_cpu5ngz,Its fine I thought using some of the words I used might get me some heat.I should probably take a more detailed look at when my technique is failing and try out some adjustments.  Like using my hand to move their head or a foot to get under a shoulder when doing armbars.  Try to pay attention to the details but also realize that transitions are a great thing to work on too so not worry about giving things up.  Really try to pay attention in the moment for say  seconds adjust see what happens then move on.  Ill get another chance at all these things and honestly I need to work on transitions probably most of all.

3557856,0,t3_311dnx,Depending on where you live BJJ classes can range from mo to over mo. I would as a general rule steer clear of places that offer training in multiple random TMAs in addition to BJJ as I find that those tend to be taught by some dude that has a mystery th Dan Black Belt in some vaguely related Jit Jitsu but really what you want to do is look up who actually teaches their BJJ classes and make sure that hes legit. rBJJ is a great resource for this and if youre willing to disclose the statecity you live in people here will almost certainly be able to give you some recommendations.gtThe gym that you will actually show up to and train it is the best gym for you. uKintanon As uButterflySammy said most places offer at least a free class.  Go to a few different gyms and try them all out.  Call email or Facebook the gym before you show up to introduce yourself and let them know when youll be coming. That might help make sure that theyve got a spare Gi in your size or whatever. Show up like  minutes before class so you can shake hands with the owner or whatever learn to put on your fighting pyjamas and tie your belt. Bring flip flops in your bag along with water a pair of gym shorts and a tshirt or compression shirt Under Armor is fine. Do not walk into the bathroom barefoot thats fucking nasty. The school might have strict requirements for bowingtitles and Gi color or it could be a super laid back place where you refer to the instructor by his first name.The gym you walk into shouldnt smell like shit and the mats should be clean. People should be pulling clean Gis out of their gym bags not Mondays Gi out of their gym locker. You shouldnt be hearing idle chatter along the lines of Man Big Bob is out with Ringworm for the third time this year!During drillingtechnique generally keep your mouth shut nobody wants to hear about how you did it in the Army. Dont correct your partners technique unless they ask for it. Attempt to match your partners intensity but as a rule go super light.If you get to roll on your first day know your limits. Please do not vomit you will not impress anybody by showing them that you dont know when to quit. People at the gym should not be calling you a pussy when you opt to sit out a round to catch your breath. If they do this is a shitty gym. In the same vein of knowing your limits tap a whole bunch.

Stand in base step back run away.Anyone who knows anything about striking will tell you that a few sleeve grips and a leg hook isnt going to stop them.Not understanding when you should stay close and when you should get away will only get you hurt.

This isnt just because of the pot being gone but because I was now motivated took jiu jitsu seriously.I arrived on time traveled to train watched tons of instructionals started drilling before class and in the mornings and really gave up all the dumb shit being high would result in me wasting my time on like excessive videogame playing and other...things...Dont want to think when training? then drill your techniques get lots of matches in and you wont have to think.I wasted a lot of time in my own development by being a dumb high dickhead in class but I know it was a phase I had to go through.,bjj,cq470dk,6,t5_2qn02

3637461,0,t3_3216k8,I just saw Xande teach a couple variations for this position yesterday. Since you like pressure passing this should work nicely for you.. Start by flattening the guy and crabwalking sideways to create a better passing angle. . Hip switch as shown at  in the video above but keep your forearm checking their head. When you hip switch dont sit on the mat keep your butt off the ground and use your toes to push off the mat and pressure their chest down with your shoulder to keep them flat. Now is the interesting part  grapevine their half guard leg the close leg that is not hooking you with your outside leg. The hip switch gives you the angle to do so. Go back to being flat with the grapevine.Two options to finish the pass. Push the hook leg with your palm and move your hooked leg over it ending up in mount. The grapevine enables it since they have no leverage to use their hook any more as their other leg cant touch the ground.. Anchor their heel to their butt like you said youve been doing and back step to end up in side control. Again the grapevine enables it since it kills the leverage of their hook.Key details for this passing sequence are Getting them flat and creating passing angles by walking sideways Caio Terra shows a similar approach for defeating the knee shield Checking their head with your forearm so they cant come inside but not crossfacing your elbow should be off the ground so you can put more pressure on their chest Keeping them flat with your shoulder on their chest.

You can avoid that by using weight vests etc. but if youre going to do weightassisted training you might as well just lift weights.

Once your opponent gets high under your armpit its pretty much game over youre either passed or getting your back taken.The first line of defense is attacking the back with butterfly hooks as he back steps. A good reversehalf passer will shoot his hips up your body so that once hes settled you cant insert a butterfly hook. So you have to make sure you insert it as he is transitioning to the reverse half. From there you can sweep and take the back rather effectively.,bjj,cqgjg8r,1,t5_2qn02
3723935,0,t3_331pgu,I trained at Atos for two years and I currently train at AOJ.  I think Im in a pretty good place to answer your questions. Youll be able to come in whenever you want at Atos pretty much but AOJ has much more limited open mat time because they seem to run a lot more classes. The plus side to AOJ is that youll have as much drilling as you want because there are literally classes from ampm.  Atos has a more limited class schedule but there are always people on the mats and there are always people looking to drill. Of course both gyms are cliquey. We spend all our time around each other.  Both gyms are very open to outside training partners though if youre not a total jerk to people youll undoubtedly make friends easily in either gym. Ive never seen anyone ostracized in either place for being a visitor.  The only time Ive ever seen problems is when people are mean egotistical etc... pretty much like everywhere else. Not sure I can answer this one. Ive loved my training at both AOJ and Atos.  It really depends on what youre looking for and what style of training suits you. Youll get hard training that will completely burn you out at either gym so it really comes down to whose style you like more Andres or the Bros?   How do you feel about white gis?  How many white gis do you own because youll need quite a few at AOJ   I will say this if youre a bigger guy say above middle heavy youll get better training at Atos most likely.

I usually wear a  relaxed fit jean due to the fact that I squat and deadlift every week and so my ass and thighs are fairly developed.  If jeans are too tight its an assthighs issue not a waist issue.  Every pair of jeans I own would fall down without a belt if they are roomy enough to be comfortable everywhere else.Cue the origin pants  I get the  waist and the waist is roomy but I cant even squat in them because they are cut for a marathon runner with no ass.  I exchange them for the  cut.  Its better but still a bit tight.  The way the origin pants are cut to get a truly comfortable pant with my build I would have to get a  waist and have TONS of useless material at the waist to have enough room for my ass and thighs.If you are a lanky guy these are probably going to be the best fitting pants ever.

For awhile I was lifting heavy three times a week and I was rolling like shit and very stressed out.  Then I decided to drop the volume and intensity of my lifting to roll more and now I feel great once again.For you I dont know if Starting Strength or Strong Lifts is right.  You basically do strongman training all day at work.  It would probably be beneficial to do some mobility exercises strengthen the muscles that my be neglected while you work and work on postural and core muscles to combat the painful positions contractors and carpenters fight themselves in for extended periods of time.

4024745,0,t3_36l77w,So I have two replies to this one general and one to your specific situation.gtow I get it. Sometime when training with the opposite gender accidents can happen. Ive touched butts my butt has been touched a partner has accidentally patted my exposed belly rather than my shoulder and the general response is an embarrassed laugh with a Sorry excuse me until your partner responds with a Hey dont worry about it. Right? Or even a quick pull away of the hand or repositioning is a fine response.Im not going to apologize for any accidental touching. Ive touched guys dicks Ive had my dick touched Ive touched boobs Ive touched ass and any other imaginable body part. Thats something you need to accept in BJJ. You wont get an apology and to be honest I probably wont even remember  seconds later so if you get upset thats not going to do much good.Now in your specific situation theres nothing accidental about it at all and that is obviously completely unacceptable. The instructor should have dealt with this guy  probably permanently. You need to be comfortable with body contact to do grappling but you certainly dont need to be tolerant towards being sexually assaulted.

Perfectly done up the intensity until form gets sloppy. Then slow it down. Do this every session. Until you hate me...

4085571,0,t3_37dxel,  minute sparring rounds yesterday and I rolled with  BB brown belt purple couple blues and a white belt.So I had some varying emotions after since I handled the fairly new white belt very easily.  As a matter of fact it was the first time I felt in control of someone since I could tap him any way I wantedwith the limited tools I know.The key for me was prior to rolling with him our black belt instructor worked me over.  Sure he didnt hurt me but I didnt stand a chancenor do most who roll with him but it put things in perspective so I didnt punish the much less skilled new white belt.I felt super self conscious rolling with the black belt.,bjj,crlzb2n,1,t5_2qn02

As a white belt I deliberately avoid most of these positions in BJJ at this point I actually dont even know what lo guard or z guard are. But think about the building blocks of BJJ. Positional hierarchy use of the hips and legs for control ie the guard in general pressure weight distribution etc. These are all the same building blocks of Judo newaza. The fundamental techniques escapes basic closed and open guard sweeps hold downs and submissions are going to be more or less the same.

I spend equal time disrupting their grips and changing angles as I do shifting their balance. I get sweeps fairly often but my game is so much stronger from the bottom that I find myself looking back at rolls and realizing that I could have gotten on top but didnt because I knew I could win from the bottom.

4233334,0,t3_39ev1s,Theres no right or wrong. Some people attack from all positions sometimes giving up a bad position. Some people like to work into a favorable position first then grind out a submission. Its more a reflection of personality and approach than anything else.In my opinion theres such a thing as being too conservative with attacks. I trained with a guy that had a killer knee slice. He would pass your guard then just maintain side control for the rest of the roll not attempting anything that might lose him the position. If you get a good position whats the point of just maintaining?I feel to be balanced you need to see what the other guy doing and adjust instead of insisting on one course of action. If hes moving his weight and posture backwards while in your guard making it hard to sweep dont insist on the sweep perhaps try a triangle setup instead. If hes standing up in your closed guard while you have a sleeve grip you can attempt an omoplata on that arm. Often that omoplata attempt ends up being a sweep anyway. If youre passing half guard and they keep ducking their head inside threaten a darce or a guilliotine.Adding submission attempts to every position will make everything else easier  passing sweeping even side control escapes.,bjj,cs2scv1,6,t5_2qn02

4359658,0,t1_csh1gyw,Think like you are doing a squat. Lower your levelcenter of gravity. If you lean your shoulders forward past your knees you become very easy to tip over or move. If you stay postured you have better control over your balance and can move with power or take advantage of an opening in your opponents defense. Most of my teammeates take advantage of my bad postureforward lean by push kicking me in the stomach and sending me backwards because i asked them to.

4371912,0,t3_3b2ou6,Ive seen it happen once at my school. The owner wasnt there that day so one of my other coaches handled it. It was a dad of one of the kids that train saying he didnt think it would work and calling out my coach at the end of the class. Dude got armbarred five times or so each time in less than  seconds. He grumbled some and then took his bruised ego home with his kid. Hes come to class a couple times since to try it out but he always has a kind of weird attitude.We are a small school in a rural part of a wrestling state so I dont know if that plays a part.

4497364,0,t3_2wv6tc,I was hunting across rbjj for posts about  masahiko kimura and I came across this write up. Great post.  I wonder have you read Masahiko Kimuras My Judo? check out  for an excerpt from it.The website also links to an interview with Helio which provides added insight on what happened that day  Definitely provides some additionaljapanese insight on the conflicts between judojiu jitsu in Brazil From  people came to see the bout including President of Brazil. Helio was cm and kg. When I entered the stadium I found a coffin. I asked what it was. I was told This is for Kimura. Helio brought this in. It was so funny that I almost burst into laughter. As I approached the ring raw eggs were thrown at me. The gong rang. Helio grabbed me in both lapels and attacked me with Osotogari and Kouchigari. But they did not move me at all. Now its my turn. I blew him away up in the air by Ouchigari Haraigoshi Uchimata Ipponseoi. At about  minute mark I threw him by Osotogari. I intended to cause a concussion. But since the mat was so soft that it did not have much impact on him. While continuing to throw him I was thinking of a finishing method. I threw him by Osotogari again. As soon as Helio fell I pinned him by Kuzurekamishihogatame. I held still for  or  minutes and then tried to smother him by belly. Helio shook his head trying to breathe. He could not take it any longer and tried to push up my body extending his left arm. That moment I grabbed his left wrist with my right hand and twisted up his arm. I applied Udegarami. I thought he would surrender immediately. But Helio would not tap the mat. I had no choice but keep on twisting the arm. The stadium became quiet. The bone of his arm was coming close to the breaking point. Finally the sound of bone breaking echoed throughout the stadium. Helio still did not surrender. His left arm was already powerless. Under this rule I had no choice but twist the arm again. There was plenty of time left. I twisted the left arm again. Another bone was broken. Helio still did not tap. When I tried to twist the arm once more a white towel was thrown in. I won by TKO. My hand was raised high. Japanese Brazilians rushed into the ring and tossed me up in the air. On the other hand Helio let his left arm hang and looked very sad withstanding the pain.tldr Masahiko Kimuras experiences outside of japan namely Brazil provides interesting insight into the evolution of both judo and brazilian jiu jitsu ,bjj,csxjrjp,1,t5_2qn02

From everything Ive seen and heard I think hes pretty damn good. garry Tonon said Weidman has darce choked him over  times and a few people that have seen him rolling with some world class guys at Renzos have said hes looked very sharp. I thought he showed some real solid jiujitsu in his earlier MMA and UFC fights although he hasnt used as much currently. I thought his pass and mount against Belfort was also really solid.There was a video of him rolling a bit at Renzos on youtube too and he looked really crisp and clean on there. Lot of cool passes and finishes. ,bjj,csytf86,4,t5_2qn02

They dont care about he fighters the sport or the art. They just want to see guys bleed. These are the same guys walking into an MMA gym wearing tap out shirts saying let me bang bro.

4516361,0,t3_3cxth0,This match took place at the Newcastle BJJ Open today in the UK.  The young lad is James hes . Hes been training since he was really young. He got his Blue Belt for his th birthday and he got his purple belt at the start of this year. He immediately went on to win at the IBJJF Europeans and IBJJF Nice Open. He trains pretty much every day.His Dad Steve is a Blue Belt. Im too polite to ask his age but he competes in Masters  at IBJJF tournaments. He introduced his son to BJJ and comes training with him as often as he can. Hes battled some issues with his knees but still shows up and keeps training. He works really really hard helping his son drill and prepare for tournaments.Steves game plan is usually to try to outlast his opponents and capitalizes on any mistakes they make when they get tired. Hes pretty good at it to be honest. One of the lads at the gym suggested a submission only match with a twist  if James taps his dad he wins. If his dad survived he would get the win. James Dad liked the idea so much he put up  as a prize for James if he won. Id been scorekeeping and doing brackets all day and was exhausted when they rounded the tournament off with this match. It was a nice laugh after lots of serious jiu jitsu.Its stuff like this which makes me love BJJ so much.,bjj,cszxjod,5,t5_2qn02

However if thats all you care about there are way quicker routes to much more reliable methods of self defense. Get a concealed carry permit or some pepper spraythat takes an hour to a couple weeks maybe a month or two if you have to take a class. Getting that good at BJJ takes years and still doesnt matter if your assailant has martial arts training of his own or a weapon or an athletic past.

4533111,0,t3_3d5q9g,The best advice I can give is to simply put yourself in those positions and fight out of it youll eventually get better at it.  Also if you havent already learn some standing guard passes.  Breaking a guard open is hard especially if their guard is good so play around with different guard breaks and different types of guard passes.   I like this guard pass a lot this is for MMA I believe I dont want to spend a lot of time finding exactly what I want so.. the only difference between how I learned it is that we would stay standing and break the guard that way and then do a standing guard pass but you have to be careful because if you do this roughly you land your partner right on their shoulder and that could injure them so you need to be controlled with you do that guard break whilst still standing.  ,bjj,ct216g4,2,t5_2qn02

4546762,0,t3_3dbi3g,Easiest things first re the friend absolutely does not matter. As a pretty new white belt you dont know nearly enough to negate lbs of advantage despite the relatively limited amount you think the friend knows. I think and this is speculation based on the very limited information I have that competition mentality might be making you hypercritical of yourself. Like having it in your head that everyone is better? They probably are  fortunately you are not trying to beat them they are your team mate and you want to learn from them. Thinking youre only going to survive? Always assume this will be the case  white belt BJJ is commonly considered the survival belt particularly for that reason. At this stage the biggest accomplishments are surviving better each time.I think regular flow rolling will help you a lot in terms of getting comfortable with how to be. Change of mentality might help too  youre not facing off against an opponent as much as testing and applying what you know and conversely taking note of what you dont.Not sure if that answered you but feel free to message if you have anything else to ask.,bjj,ct3qtop,2,t5_2qn02

The real killers  dont have time to be out drinking loud mouth soup and  theyre not gonna talk about it at the bar with people that cannot relate to the realities of combat. The real killers are the ones that look like everyday Joes and then surrounding you without you even knowing it. What the general public knows about PTSD is also bullshit. People think that PTSD only manifests itself with violent tendencies. That is absolutely not the case. Honestly the situation you got yourself into sounds like a group of guys yourself included all looking for a fight and you obliged them. Honestly you should know better than this. Youre a fucking black belt and could easily have your way with  of the population. You dont have a fucking thing to prove. All you had to do was say cool guys I think Im going to head to another bar. Here is my card in case you guys ever feel like doing some training. Then walk away. Man Im not trying to lecture you but you need to be carrying yourself in a higher standard. You missed a great opportunity to sell your gym and get some new guys in there AND you got into a street fight because you couldnt disengage andor deescalate the situation.

There have been matches that Ive watched where the ref lets it go on even though the guy is out.  Im also kind of a control freak and dont want to be unconscious around people I dont know in public. Finally if a choke is sunk in and Im not getting out of it might as well tap.  There are ways you can be hurt while be choked especially for a wind choke.  ,bjj,cttpb46,2,t5_2qn02

4857915,0,t3_3hbuy7,One of the things I like about BJJ is that  of the people who do it really want to do it and are motivated to do more than just turn up to class. Im not convinced that marketing to people who arent interested and hoping that they will suddenly develop an interest is worth it.Judo in the UK tried that back in . Numbers increased dramatically for a short time but then they shrank to lower than ever before. Most of the new guys didnt stick around because they werent interested in Judo really they just fell for the marketing. A lot of the experienced practitioners became disillusioned partly rule changes but also partly because their clubs changed to try to retain the new people and they moved on to SamboWrestling.I think the best thing to do is just do BJJ if you like it. Represent BJJ in how healthyhappy you are. Say I cant go out this weekend because Im going to a tournament and then answer peoples questions if they ask them. The ones that are motivated to ask questions and show up of their own accord are more likely to stick around and theyre the kind of people that I personally want to have as training partners.,bjj,cu6vkh5,1,t5_2qn02

I was a lot younger at the time got to hang out with him a lot with my other buddy that would go to class too. It taught me how to be an awesome person that has fun more than anything. I respected that a lot and Its something that I think super rare. It also is what got me hooked on jiu jitsu. Worst I was rolling with a purple belt that was realatively big guy. He had a reputation for hurting people. I remember being in top half guard and some strange sweep started to happen. I tried to post and it wasnt stopping him from coming on top. I still dont know how it happened but my posted arm was trapped while he was coming up and it was putting a lot of pressure on my spine to the point that it was actually scary. I didnt care about being swept at all at this point I was just trying to get my posted arm rotating with the rest of my body and his bodyweightlbs that was about to fold me in half. Only time I had ever felt scared about rolling. Im also known for being more aggressive smasher too so Ive had hard rolls before.

If you dont push yourself you arent going to get better at BJJ. Coaches can only do so much but your training is going to have to come from within. If you werent having fun you shouldnt do it.

You can transition to whatever you want. NorthSouth KoB Mount whatever you can do but you cant use your hands to do it.Its hard as a hell but just doing it for  minutes at a time a few times will teach you a lot about using just your body to control your opponent and make it that much easier to free your hands up to attack.,bjj,cuggc18,2,t5_2qn02

Should I go into rolls with those in mind or is this something I shouldnt even worry about as a white belt?,bjj,cunie9w,2,t5_2qn02

4993873,0,t3_3jbje1,I think this kind of question is very much related to the post last week? about why it is difficult to get people to start BJJ. Some of the comments including my own were related to its hard for people suck at something and look bad in a group of people better than themselves.There is no way to better prepare yourself to start BJJ. You arent going to show up super fit and impress anyone. You wont be able to memorize a bunch of YouTube submissions and expect them to work. The first many classes are going to suck no matter what you do. You will have pains and moments of panic and will have to take every second role off so that you dont puke all over the mat. You will be tired after shrimping half way across the mat and will feel like you already worked out towards the end of the warmup or midway through the drills. The explanation of the drills will feel like an impossible number of unrecognizable moves to remember. And as bad as the first half of every role will feel it will be nothing compared to the second half when the little you have in your defensive toolbox completely runs out of juice. Your partners will literally let you get up out of turtle out of empathy and understanding so that your heart rate doesnt stay at  bpm for too long. They dont want to be puked on for some reason.You might be exhilarated by how much you suck and the journey forward or you might be crippled by it. If the latter maybe BJJ isnt for you.If you go you are a new BJJ practitioner. Its a fact. It doesnt make you a lesser person. It makes you a less skilled BJJ practitioner. Guaranteed that everyone more experienced than you knows exactly what it feels like to be where you are at.Embrace it! Rip the proverbial bandaid of newness off and just go train. The fastest route to get to whatever place you have it in your head you should be before starting BJJ is through starting BJJ itself.Knowing all this now prepare yourself mentally for it embrace the suck and get on the mat.,bjj,cuny4s8,4,t5_2qn02

Ive got a number of guys who want to train  but either cant find time in their schedule to get out for a class but in  months things should be settled down!  perpetually  or need to get in shape first.

5050972,0,t1_cuutf0o,maybe you could split the difference and go with some more novice people and let them smash you from the beginning so you have something to work out of. the trick will be not smashing them too badly when you get out or you will scare them away.       positional sparing might get you some a good workout they start in your guard and have to pass. you have to sweep or submit. the hardest rounds where i train are in competition training. outside of that it is the grudge matches.  we have some students that are hell bent on beating each other.  we really encourage that stuff as long as it stays friendly. it makes for some really competitive matches as well as some funny banter before and afterwards. the problem is you have to have trained with people for a while before you get that sort of relationship.     i know exactly what you are talking about.  i have often said that i would not likely get past a blue belt if i started today because of age and injuries. the truth is i rely on my technical ability to get me out of stuff.... that means i am not grinding as hard as i used to.,bjj,cuuu0pn,3,t5_2qn02

5057155,0,t3_3k88i0,I think your problem is best solved in sparring. Try to think about where youre spending your time while sparring if you find your self in top control most of the time your guard wont get any better. One easy thing to implement is to always start from bottom forcing you to play guard. Also  try to avoid closed guard unless thats your goal area and try to recover guard instead of scrambling to top position. Hope this helps!,bjj,cuvktma,2,t5_2qn02

If you have your leg trapping their arm and head it isnt a bad thing to grab your shin and roll or fall back then lock up the triangle with your other leg. Whoever told you its bad practice probably told you that because if youre not comfortable or proficient at triangles and you lose the triangle you end up on your back and probably getting passed.

5141996,0,t3_3lffcj,the straight ankle lock and basic positions for finishing it are a good place to start IMO. Personally I would say start out making it a feature of your bottom game when you escape from positions and then slowly make it apart of your guard passing once you have a passing sequence you like and use it as a way to take away certain foot positions of guard retention. ,bjj,cv5sw7e,3,t5_2qn02

A lockdown with your knees bent is no good  it can be escaped at any time by the top person doing a leg curl. A good lockdown pushes into the opponents shin so much it is actually painful for them.The second thing is to push the lockeddown leg sideways to the outside and up. In th planet terminology they call it whipping up the leg. It forces the top person to turn their knee inside and takes away some of their base.,bjj,cv70n5j,5,t5_2qn02

Its possible in theory and I could definitely make it to work on time. Thanks for the real talk though if I were really committed to the morning thing I could make it work.The main thing that happened was actually I personally wanted to stay late past everyone else nobody had asked me to do that or expected me to do that. There is no policy around hours since Im a full employee. Its just more of a cultural thing that I noticed several people stay late so I thought Id do it too. But its definitely not mandatory or even explicitly mentioned. In fact if I show up before everyone else like  or even  nobody has come in yet I should have a reasonable excuse that Im more of a arrive early and leave early person than an arrive late leave late person. ,bjj,cv8pgak,3,t5_2qn02

5283860,0,t3_3nbwl7,I did some classes in Brazil when I was a few months into training BJJ and had very little Portuguese language skills. There was no English spoken at all I felt lost most of the time in classes at home so was even more lost in these classes as expected. I learned some body part names and basics before I went and managed to get through.A few years later and Ive been training in Romania this year. Again I speak very little Romanian but everyone in class has been incredibly helpful. Its much easier to pick up on concepts and moves this time by watching. I watch intently listen for any words I know and some of the guys will translate for me when needed or key points if Im unsure. I still get a bit lost at times and am sure I miss out on a bit but overall its definitely been a positive experience.Ive never learned a second language fluently and am struggling with it. Since Im here for work I have limited free time and have prioritised BJJ over language classes in the evenings in the hopes I can use online resources and pick it up as I go. I also got very little notice before I was sent off from Australia by work so didnt have time to try learn much of the language ahead of arriving. Ive thankfully found it pretty easy to get by on the basics  English.Edit formatting,bjj,cvn2ov6,2,t5_2qn02

5285791,0,t1_cvn7z65,I like to place my forearmelbow on the mat right above my opponents head and clamp down my knees on his ribs while my other arm fight his elbow so I can slowly grind my way up to occupying that space under his armpit with my knee  then either transition to Smount or try to get the other knee up in his other arm pit by switching the forearm controlling the hand and attack the hand. If the guy starts trying to buck while im high up or manages to shrimp me down  ill put grape vines in and drop my hips on my opponents gut and try to work my way back up to Smount. I basically arch my back and drop my hips to maintain pressure the entire time im in mount  I dont want to give any space and I want my mount to be uncomfortable for my opponent to breathe. If you want to be a dick you can also use your Gi to microwave your opponent  i.e use your gi to suffocate while youre high up in mount. You can get people tired by staying tight and having your hips low. ,bjj,cvnbleq,1,t5_2qn02

It can also get you surprisingly jacked without compromising range of movement.The other thing I would suggest is some sort of movement programme like Ginastica Natural Ido Portal Method or what Im currently doing the Gold Medal Bodies Elements programme.

From half I focus on preventing the crossface first plan A is to get the underhook if I cant or the opponent responds with a strong whizzer I look to go to octopus half.A good darcer will look to almost create armlock style pressure on your underhook and swim your arm through to attack the chokeIts a great time to swim through to the far side.

5521614,0,t3_3qqd98,The nice thing about pressure is that gravity and your weight is constant and relentless. It doesnt require any effort and it doesnt come in spurts like strength. Make your opponent carry your weight so that every movement they make is heavy and laborious and they will tire eventually. Pressure and good control is how you set the pace. It doesnt matter if you go fast or slow as long as you are the one setting the pace to your level.The ultimate style is to pressure and slow down the game when needed and bait and stay one step ahead when needed. Its not a matter of big guys are heavy and light guys are fast. The situation dictates when to be heavy and when to be fast. You need both and need to adapt constantly moment by moment.Whats the limits of floaty styles? They never take advantage of gravity and weight so their opponent doesnt tire as easily. Their opponent is free to move as fast as they do.Whats the limits of pressure styles? They miss opportunities to bait and catch their opponent off guard. Their opponent is able to stay one step ahead on defense because they have more time to assess the situation and react.,bjj,cwhfphf,3,t5_2qn02

I roll with a huge blue belt partner and jesus I have to up my speed to counter his pressure. Then I roll with smaller whites and It allows me to work on transitions. Unless you are specifically working for a particular tournament that is on the horizon I think you are being unreasonable and unflexible. Dont roll the same way. If they tap so what.

Someone on this thread called these guys lazy...yes they definitely appear out of shape but has anyone of you had to grapple with someone with excited delirium?  Im not talking about a new white belt on the mat but someone who is truly off his rocker?  Now add the fact that the police cannot use certain grappling techniques for fear of another Eric Garner because it is sanctioned by your police council.I get it these guys are out of shape and probably couldve done things better but its tough for someone to sit behind their computer and watch a  minute video and get the whole picture.  A guy in handcuffs doped up can be just as difficult as a guy not cuffed up.  We do not know the whole story or what transpired prior to this video and tasing for all intensive purposes was the best solution in this case even though it looks bad.This dude had other things going on inside him...the taser did not cause his death.  As far as grappling and whatnot what if those guys and very large out of shape lady just jumped on him and tried to hold him down.  The guy wouldve still died due to whatever the internal issue was.  The point I guess Im trying to make and anyone can have their own opinion is that LEOs are put into a box when it comes to using certain techniques because if its not sanctioned by the higher powers in your state youre days as a LEO are done.,bjj,cwz10ne,0,t5_2qn02

5683578,0,t1_cx1i0d3,I agree its bad BJJ. However these patterns are found all to often in MMA even with people that are considered good at Jujitsu. More often than not people with reputable or high level jujitsu get beat on by wrestlers with a basic understanding of positionssubmissions. Rickson also talked about this problem with high level black belts in MMA. I could provide you with many gifts of reputable Jujitsu practitioners implementing a sportive guard or failing to control the opponent from the bottom and getting beat up but it is too time consuming. I also think youve watched some of these fights and can understand my point without any visual references. For those reasons I will not posts anymore more gifs to illustrate my point. I think simply dismissing it as the fighter is bad at juijitsu doesnt allow us to explore the causes of bad BJJ which I think is due to failure to teach traditional selfdefence techniques. There are many fighters that have done great in reputable competitions but are unsuccessful in MMA because they dont block punches or control posture. There are also many sportive guys that have done great in MMA but they had to change their game considerably. People like Frias  Zahabi think that JuiJitsu will make a comeback but Im skeptical. ,bjj,cx1lqb6,1,t5_2qn02

I have seen some rather excessive celebrations for minor stuff and even ive caught myself getting a little too excited over landing something ive been trying for unsuccessfully for a long time. I guess when it comes together and the training finally sinks in in the form of a victory the emotions can get a little wonky. still tho...i get mad at myself even for celebrating something a little too much and end up apologizing like crazy to everyone around hoping i didnt offend anyone.

5780682,0,t3_3uabf6,Timings part of it I think. I think another part is that the judo throws are just hard. You have to get the hips to do this and the body to be tight against that and get the arm up and you mess up any of the elements and youre standing trying to lift a resisting dude whos behind you.I find wrestling much more intuitive. You get his legs and push him backwards or to the side. You pick up one of his legs and then make him fall. Maybe its just me but judo just seems to require more finesse at the very basic level.

Id recommend the MonWed midday classes if youre gi focused as the MondayWednesday nights can sometimes be a little crowded. NoGi on Thursday nights is wrestling focused and Fridays we do Judo with Judo Olympian and National team members RJ and Aaron Cohen dropping in to teach the day class from time to time.

5872250,0,t3_3voun9, Yes and no.  You may be more prone to concussions genetically than other people.  However since there is less work on the takedowns in BJJ there seems to be fewer moments where a head slams against the mat.  Just remember that accidents will happen. Your pressure will be great as will your ability to work from the top.  You will most likely have to concentrate on working off of your back but at your age it shouldnt be hard to do so. I believe Montreal is home to Grappling Industries and David Aguzzi who puts on several tournaments each year. At any gym that you enjoy the atmosphere people and facilities.  To each their own.Final advice Wrestlers go harder than JiuJiteiros so there may be people who accuse you of going too hard.  Dont get upset at them see if theyre able to help you.

5917075,0,t3_3wd6n4,It is important to adopt a cerebral and cognitive approach to BJJ. However what youre doing is just subjecting yourself to information overload. Just go to the gym and train. Dont try to bypass the days when you will get smashed submitted and dominated with information to get ahead of your classmates. Most people whom have gone through the ranks with me all started out the same way we found a position or submission which we learnt during class that we liked and built our game off this slowly. Thats how you develop you own style in BJJ. You might be impressed with Romulo Barrals use of the spider guard but if youre short stocky and built like an ogre chances are you wont get good at the spider guard no matter how much you work on it. When youre a white belt certain positionssubmissions will just feel right when you do them. This is a process of discovery requiring mat time not time watching DVDs.

5969901,0,t1_cy24tv7,It definitely can put someone to sleep. Braulio Estima has a good video on that here The idea is to to make sure if their chin is tucked that you get their chin right in the bottom of the V of your choking arm. A lot of people stress that with the RNC but in reality you rarely see the V lined up perfectly and it doesnt matter so much if youre under the chin. But on the chin if you get the crook of that V in place and you sort of squeeze down in and up it will pull their chin into their arteries and throat more than enough to put someone to sleep. It doesnt hurt very much either on the receiving end. Usually when a chin RNC hurts as the receiver is when the blade of their forearm is partially lined up on your chinlower teeth and thats where you are probably more likely to end up with dentaljaw damage. Hope that helps. ,bjj,cy26o86,6,t5_2qn02

You also dont have to run to the police to get them to defend you. The fourth thing is we dont know what truck man thought when the bad guy hit the box.

Hell Ive got  or  Multi time world champions in our gym and they wont even look in my direction come time to roll. Its not that they are scared or dont believe in their technique its just preference. Some of my favorite training partners are those who are half my size more experienced and can turn up the heat when needed. Ill gladly take a beating if I have to work for it. Theres a video on you Tube where Josh Barnett is having a conversation and said anyone that believes that top level athletes dont use strength during rolls is fooling them selves. They give and get strength and use it to their advantage.  This is also a part of smaller guys not possibly wanting to roll with larger guys. Find a partner who youre comfortable with wholl let you work your technique. This person may be a higher belt whos got the wherewithal to put you in your place if you start spazzing out yet then isnt afraid to correct your technique or something youre not doing correctly. Im a firm believer in the Big BrotherSister theory in BJJ. Its a higher belts responsibility to help out the lower belts in a constructive way.

No. But they are pretty close and can be improved.I dont think halfguard is better than side control because even though you can effectively strike from halfguard you dont have as much control over your opponents ability to make space and escape. gt The reason guard isnt awarded points is the fact you are on your backSo do you think guard top should be awarded points?,bjj,cyebdgq,1,t5_2qn02

Its a pancake.The  takedown starts with a fancy flip but the actual takedown is a snap down spin around done to a kneeling opponent.,bjj,cyhhr1p,0,t5_2qn02

But its ok if BJJ isnt your source of income and you have other responsibilities then BJJ shouldnt be your priority and you should view it as you say a hobby. Just take it for what it is a good workout that you enjoy and a skill that you can evolve at. So what if its slower than others at least you turn up and try while having a pile of other things in your life. That dedication is more than those who can turn up day in day out without any other burdens.

If its putting torque on your knee it not worth the risk where it is.If they sit back and lower take it out and use a lapel feed around their leg or berimbolo or grab the near ankle and put your foot on their hip to make space and go to an X variation.

6273338,0,t3_41epfa,Im assuming you are getting mat burn? If so you will learn to move without dragging your feet so much and getting mat burn will be much less frequent. The same for your teammates you are talking about. As for why you would get mat burn in different areas of your feet it is probably because the motions you are making that are sliding your feet across the mat are different. So you may be dragging your feet while moving one way and they are doing it with a different motion putting different parts of your feet in contact with the mat. This gets drastically better pretty quicklyyour feet toughen up a bit and you stop moving as awkwardly. ,bjj,cz2phm8,1,t5_2qn02

When you have these grips stand up your leg on the same side as the sleeve control high and tight next to their chest. Stand up with the other leg and turn your hips the guard should pop open.

6344993,0,t1_czareek,gt I now firmly believe that people need to have a somewhat positive experience the first few times they roll if they are to stick to it for the long haul.I completely agree with you in that the above should be the goal. However Id prefer to see it achieved in different way without restricting the new students.Just letting new white belt jump incan have mixed results. If they ended up paired with a slightly smaller weaker  month white belt itll be a messy roll to say the least. But if they rolled with the black belt head coach it will most likely be an an eye opening experience and the highlight of the class. But obviously the head coach wont be available for new students everytime.In short there has to be a suitable middle ground. Id suggest that the new student first rolls with a medium sized. In some instances a bluebelt with a decent amount of awareness is suitable too. After that first roll they only roll with coloured belts for the first month. After that assume average attendance they should have enough of an understanding to roll with the whole class.This way I feel is the best of both worlds. As they are getting the experience of rolling but under somewhat controlled conditions.,bjj,czaut0d,6,t5_2qn02

6348486,0,t3_42l8rk,Ive done two trips in  and  for  weeks and  weeks respectively.My first trip I was a fresh white belt. I was with Infight Brazil.   We went the first  days up in a private secluded villa in the mountains for a training camp before the Rio Open.  There was about  of us and they brought in a bunch of high level guys to train with us.   I was a bit overwhelmed as the only whitebelt but this experience was probably the reason I fell in love with BJJ.After the camp we went back to Barra da Tijuca area.  Infights Rio gym is located there.  It was much more calmer than Copacabana and extremely less busy area it was pretty safe. The Infight gym was a short walk from our beach front condo. We would train x a day there and do some outings between.  We had the two main instructors and one of their students with us most of the time and they acted as translators for the most part.As a pretty fresh white belt about  months exp I found the other whitebelts to be just the same as me.  It was tough training but I learn a lot. I still remember an omoplata setup one of the blackbelts showed me from that trip and still use it today.  Im not sure if training was always that tough or if it was because we were competing at the Rio Open.Second trip in  I was a pretty dedicated blue belt.  I moved cities and was training with Rodrigo Munduruca  Gracie Humaita now.    Myself and one went down and we stayed right in Humaita neighborhood not far from Rodrigos mothers.   We wouldnt really venture out at night far without Rodrigo at night mostly since we knew zero portuguese.  Rodrigo had a car so hed pick us up and drive us to the gym.We trained at Gracie Humaita x a day.   Warms ups were light and classes were strict. We were again there for the Rio Open so one room was pretty much dedicated to blackbelts only. Its not a big place.   But as a blue belt I still felt good where my skill was compared to the other blue belts.  Wed usually go relax at Copacabana beach in the afternoons and nap. Both were incredible trips.TLDR  neighborhoods tend to be sketchy  knowing Portuguese is incredibly helpful or at least a translator  I never seen or experienced any type of flow rolling  keep it playful  skillwise was about equal to what I was used to back in Canada  Different gyms have different levels of stubbornness to tapping.  I travel and train in California now cheaper most gyms english,bjj,czb9323,10,t5_2qn02

The whole purpose of systems that allow live rolling are for you to remove harmfuldangerous elements in favor of the longevity of training. The arts intention is still to train with self defense in mind. You dont need to allow strikes to know that sitting on your ass in a self defense situation is retarded unless you were forced there. When training shifts to favor the rules of the sport you move away from the art itself. Which is fine if you just want to play a sport. But its still a disservice to the art. ,bjj,czdicfh,2,t5_2qn02

6385310,0,t3_43476i,Firstly Ill say I have a huge bias for MgInAction because its the only one I use out of the  you listed and also because I have very similar physical attributes to Marcelo decently athletic short but strong legs and arms similar height and weight and  of my game is based on his.MGInAction is THE shit.That being said it is the biggest reason why I am still motivated to do JiuJitsu because I have seen such an improvement in my game due to MGInAction. Marcelo is an extremely detailed instructor yet he is extremely concise and puts concepts in a way that is extremely easy to understand for example by using analogies. He not only teaches techniques but also offers lessons on mindset as well similar to thisSuper motivating and these videos also have changed my game a lot.Marcelos techniques will generally work on bigger guys provided you have decent athleticism and base strength. His game is focused almost entirely on transitions and is very fun to play.MGInAction has by far the most videos out of the  you described and is probably the most comprehensive. It has  video clips!!I could talk on and on about why I love MGInAction.TLDR Get MGInAction.,bjj,czffx6n,2,t5_2qn02

I imagine your path will be harder than mine since youre a smaller female and Im a shmedium male.What has helped me is letting certain people tap me one or multiple times to get their ego out of the way so we can have a good roll after that.

6440252,0,t3_43p82t,About a year ago I was competing at a small tournament that I decided to enter last minute. It was just me and my wife that made the drive up to compete so we didnt have anyone from our team there. We started talking to Brandon before my division just about where we were from and what school. A little later on when I was competing Brandon started coaching me a little bit because he is super nice I was a white belt and my attempt at using half guard was probably painful to watch. After the match he walked me through some details on the sweep I was working let me practice it on him and then came around and coached me through my next few matches. The point of all this is just to say I randomly met Brandon at a tournament without really knowing me or the school I was from he coached me through my matches and really tried his best to help me out. It may sound small but it really did mean a lot to me for him to take the time and effort for a complete stranger.Thanks Brandon and congrats on the Black Belt! ,bjj,czlgloo,2,t5_2qn02

So whether you start on your knees or your feet break grips! if they establish grips their pull is more more effective so if you break and establish your own you are ahead. Work your takedowns into a pass or if they still pull concentrate on your grips and controlling their legs. Maybe force a half guard.,bjj,czmgr2q,1,t5_2qn02

Sure it sucks if you have to pay out a grand and insurance doesnt help but theyll be there when you get billed  grand.If youre young enough you can be covered by your parents plan and if youre poor enough no shame in that you can get plans for very low cost.Now I have and love my plan which is a PPO that Ive never managed to be out of network for free preventative services including dental low deductible low total OOP.

As a general rule dont put your free foot on his leg to push it away unless you are controlling the far arm or are using the leg as bait to gain control of the far arm. If he grabs your free leg immediately pull that knee to your chest grab his sleeve and then kick out your leg to break the grip and gain control of his far arm. If you have no grip or control of the far arm keep your free foot on the floor and attack the back the attack does not need to be a berimbolo. Your hand should be gripping the same side sleeve belt or collar. Both your free side hand and leg should be actively fighting for the control you want to for your preferred attacks do not just hang out in this position.

Most softtissue injuries are actually misdiagnosed fractures.  You would not always see these on an xray alone gotta get a bone scan.For fractures of the rib increasing vitamin D is critical.  Also zinc has some benefit in bone remodeling.  Studies on rowers who get rib stress fractures have shown that low vitamin D is a risk factor.  TENS unit wont really help heal injuries.  What it will help with is the sensation of pain as well as the muscular spasms that happen with injuries.If you do have a fracture there are devices called bone stimulators that can help fractures heal faster and more strongly.  Honestly a lot of the healing is diet and reducing activity that aggravates it.

6822867,0,t3_48z5lz,My theory is its easier to apply guillotines and darcesanacondas etc with skinny arms. This is coming from a guy with fat arms who cant get those submissions.,bjj,d0po5li,1,t5_2qn02

6824512,0,t1_d0pu1wz,gt Assuming that the fight went to the ground immediately whether it started on the knees or Nate got a takedown right off the opening bell I still think Conor was at a huge risk of being submitted. Even if Nate didnt throw a single strike he is still more than capable of passing Conors guard and submitting him because well... Stockton motherfucker.again the assumption that it is going to the ground is the issue. Yes Nate has a huge edge on the ground. Closing that distance isnt easy in MMA there are near countless fights to show this but Garbrandt vs Tanquinho is a prime example Garbrandt isnt anywhere near the ground grappler Tanquinho is but Tanquinho was never able to effectively close the gap. Rousey vs Holm is another example. Tate did a much better job of closing that distance and even then she struggled for rounds at time to get in on Holm. And Nate even got McGregor down in the first round and McGregor hit a sweep and finished the round on top. ,bjj,d0puvgl,4,t5_2qn02

6830107,0,t1_d0qh7q5,He was taking a bunch of direct shots to the face when he was on his back. Giving up the back is not going to yield many positive outcomes but it makes ground and pound a bit more difficult as your opponent isnt allowed to strike you to the back of the head so you can focus on just protecting the sides. Theres also the possibility that he had resigned himself to defeat and was just setting up the least damaging finish. If he kept on taking shots to the head he could end up with a heavy concussion if Nate managed to grab an arm from the top theres a possibility for injury. RNC sucks but out of the available options Id say its the best way to go. ,bjj,d0qhrbz,7,t5_2qn02

6832919,0,t1_d0qsjal,Yes my new instructor is a black belt. Though he doesnt compete anymore and doesnt even roll with people people say he rolls maybe once every  weeks with one person. I couldnt find anybody knowing his lineage and I dont feel like asking it would be a good move since Im not sure how he reacts.Edit But I am pretty sure he is a legit BB. Thing is it seems he is out of real rolling for a few years now. My old coach was great a carlson gracie bb who admittedly was a bit greedy with belts but we didnt care too much.I hate the idea of him hearing that I started wearing a brownbelt right after leaving .

6833208,0,t3_49d79i,Absolutely awesome. Conor was talking about that after the match. He said between the high elbow guillotine and the leg trap that he was totally unable to pass and had to flip out and sacrifice the top position. Marcelo Garcia is golden for instructionals on how to use your legs in tricky ways like that to keep them in the choke. Nate Diaz has my favorite guillotines in MMA. I was honestly surprised he didnt finish it right there. If you take a shot on Diaz and dont get guillotine choked Im surprised. Hes got such awesome high elbow and prayerJones guillotines. Hes also great at using his legs to either trap their arm and press it down or extend it away from their body. Its a lot like the Rafa Mendes anaconda choke adjustment or the Braulio EstimaBill Cooper darce choke adjustment. Pretty sure Nates done that in several fights. Marcus Davis and Jim Miller come to mind. ,bjj,d0qufqe,46,t5_2qn02

7061976,0,t3_4cbpcl,Match Good takedown pressure and good passing. If youre going to hang out on your knees in half guard pinch your knees together so your opponent cant just pull his leg out and get full guard. You need to break your opponents collar grips as soon as they get there. Your corners right on the grip break. Break the grips with  on  on the wrist youre over reliant on the gi grip which isnt there. Once youre passed the guard stay off your knees so he feels your weight. On the armbar defense you have to stack him and crush his knees to his head before pulling your arm out. Posturing up gives him the armbar. Good work you were killing this guy before you got caught.Match Shoe laces to the ground on the sprawl. Nice open guard sweep. In half guard you had your free knee super high up on his body so he got an underhook on your leg. You need to get your crossface deeper and really drive him away. Then you can drive your leg back to get rid of that leg hook. You were sitting in  mount and you let the guy turn into you to get half guard AND take an underhook. In  mount the leg thats hooked needs to be super heavy on his thigh so he cant even entertain the idea of turning to face you. If he manages to you gotta get that underhook in sooner. If he gets the underhook make sure you pull his bottom arm off the ground so he cant come up for the old school sweep. Later on you got underhook half guard. Instead of going for the rollback sweep grab his toes with your bottom hand and come up to finish the old school sweep. Now youre stuck in side control. I know youre tired but heres where the technique will save you. Frames in before you bridge. Good job toughing it out looked like a hard match.Match I know you got some takedown chops. This guy is super obvious about his guard pull. Youre looking for outside reaps but his legs are square and wide open. Ko uchi gari and drive into him for  pts. You get stuck in a knee slide scramble after his guard opens. Pull his bottom arm off the ground as you slide and get heavy on him. Good log splittercredit card pass. Now youre in combat base get passing! Hes already got a sleeve grip and a de la riva hook on your knee up side so you gotta understand youre liable to get knocked that way as soon as you get there. Ask your instructor how to pass de la riva. Almost got that scissor sweep at the end. Good try.Final takeawaysGreat work! With a few adjustments theres no reason why you cant come back to the next tourney and sweep your matches. Go over arm bar defense and escapes with your instructor. You have a habit of panic posturing instead of driving into them and stacking. Get your knees off the mat and pressure when youre on top! Make him feel your weight. When you half guard pass you leave a lot of space under you for the guys leg to come up and re guard. Either pinch his leg with your knees together if youre going to stay on your knees or get your free foot on his thigh to start pushing out. With your knee slide pass if you cant get an underhook your inside hand is the one that collar grips. Your outside hand should be pulling their bottom arm off the mat.,bjj,d1gu3oo,5,t5_2qn02

In my classes I try and force everyone to do everything nice and slow... I say slow is smooth smooth is fast  You ever watch guys like the Mendez brothers or Ciao Terra or Bruno Malfacine? Those guys are smooth as silk in their technique so they appear to be fast. They probably are moving quickly at times as well but can afford to do so because their technique allows that.... slow is smooth smooth is fast..If you can force yourself to do things slow and technical it will benefit you greatly in my opinion. Every roll I have I try to do everything nice and slow and technical even though im a big guy. This saves my energy so I can roll for a long time plus it just helps be refine everything.

Your head will move up and you will replace the pressure that your head had on the opponents tricep with pressure from your chest. You will slightly turn your hip to go into a technical mount situation. You will slowly extract the choking arm and place the outside arm under the opponents neck grabbing his arm to secure the position.,bjj,d1s69bk,2,t5_2qn02

Bjj is a competitive art and you are likely to experience the occasional minor injury. I strongly suspect that if you start tapping simply from bad position itll become a self fulfilling prophecy. You can not possibly reach a point where you are comfortable live rolling without live rolling. Last point  even though you dont know a technique doesnt mean you cant do it. If youre in an unknown position do what your gut says and try to work out why it did or didnt work. This will teach you the concepts of bjj not just individual techniques. For example if my arm gets bent in this direction Ill tap instead of he is executing a figure  from mount the first step of this escape is to x... ,bjj,d29ogl6,2,t5_2qn02

Fortunately Ryan was okay and he has also been a tremendous sport about the fact that the video resurfaces every now and then and that people laugh about it.So the answer to your question It was actually pretty bad. I felt terrible about putting anyone to sleep let alone a friend who had invited me into his academy to do a seminar my first one. Then I have to add these other missteps. After Ryan went out I continued to talk for several seconds I was clearly oblivious to my surroundings and the safety of my partner and I had to be told by someone in the group that he was out.. Once I realized what had happened I covered my mouth in shock and didnt do much else again someone else had to go over to him to see if he was all right.In short that video captured what to me were some serious holes in my leadership skills. I say were because I hope I am a better leader now.Thanks for the question iloseagain. Its definitely a tough one for me to answer.,bjj,d2bvksa,19,t5_2qn02

Im not proud of injuring him no one wants to see anyone actually get hurt. Nor was it a shady tactic. Im proud of my performance why wouldnt I show it off? I go for breaks is out of context.

In otherwords my lungs are shit.The first days of class I was literally the only one gasping for air during the  minute of roundrobbin sparring as everyone else looked fine.. heck we even get a breathing break inbetween rounds.. it shouldnt be that bad right?  not me lol.  I started to wonder if I just will never have the lungs for this.  I remember getting lightheaded and felt like i might pass out lol but i didnt want to be a bitch and kept going.Well Im still only a few classes in Im still gasping for air but no where near as bad... but I can make it through the  minutes just barely.

7389072,0,t1_d2i2rs8,Thanks Im more than happy to be corrected and come up to date on the rules. Yeah I also see what you mean about students. I guess the difficulty is that its actually usually more easy to control gi divisions as the belt system is fairly standardized. No Gi is muddier and people compete sometimes without even having a BJJ focused grappling coach. Would you think going by years is better? Or some sort of grey Beginner Intermediate Advanced Expert? Good points regardless.,bjj,d2i354e,1,t5_2qn02

There are certainly techniques that I regularly use that are way less effective against guys their size so I tend to shy away from using them. That being said I would never use the excuse of Well that would have worked if it were smaller No it would have worked if my BJJ was better. Saying it would have worked if you were smaller would just be an excuse so I could feel better about myself because the fact is if I really knew the techniques in and out like your instructor does then I could hit it on someone any size.

Rugby clothing needs to be quite tough or its not going to survive a single game. As a result its going to last you forever when used for BJJ.

Often I get really frustrated with how slow Im learning relative to others. I also get frustrated if Im not learning a move fast enough too. But those are the bad days there are other days when I feel unstoppable and I feel that my learning has gone by very fast. Took me about a year and a half to blue belt then  years to purple.

7428910,0,t3_4h1iki,Not quite what youre asking but Robson Mouras Super Nogi set has an excellent turtle hook series where he uses a leg control to stop the opponent going behind him. This is probably the best example in my collection of him using the actual hook and the position which is kind of inbetween the side ride and behind positionIts one of those great dvds where each move builds of the next to make a gameplan.

Well no one has done that. Ive never seen someone refuse to grapple a TLI team member on moral grounds at anh level. Ive never heard of an event thats banned them. Whats happening here is lazy outrage slacktivism. Theres a sudden expectation for grappling industries to punish an employee for something theyve done off the clock that isnt a crime on the grounds of collective morals. If people wanna boycott an event then by all means... But to pretend your on some moral high ground for choosing grappling industries is a farce. Every group in bjj can be connected to TLI in some way and unless your going to go the full nine yards and exclude from those as well all thats happening here is an attempt at soapboxing.What excuses were made? This is a grownup whose entitled to do what he wants when hes not on the clock. If the mob isnt asking for some kind of punishment what are they asking for? Because it seems like the good things grappling industries has done already isnt good enough and theyre somehow cowards for not having a morality police on staff to scrutinize the personal lives of their employees.Loyd Irvin is a price of trash and so are the people involved in his scandal... But that does not mean we need to vilify anyone whose ever come into contact with him unless they stand up and publicly disassociate.Further to suggest that this makes grappling industries a place were people shouldnt feel safe is absurd. The events are nothing but professional and completely free of the politicking bullshit most other events are infested with. Really how can it be suggested that the mob isnt looking for punishment and then suggest that theres a reason to feel unsafe in the same block of text. Its retarded,bjj,d2om3dx,6,t5_2qn02

7482093,0,t1_d2sm32n,We didnt have this structure in place until I started implementing it a few months ago. Before that open mat was . free rolling for everyone. Even flow rolls were pretty rare.That being said I think the best way to think about the differences for me is at higher levels I got better at forcing things towards whatever I wanted to actively work on. Right now I have maybe half a dozen things that I guide towards when Im rolling with blue belts who are my main playground. I dont care which of those things come up but I do try to avoid other results unless Im just out to have fun with a gimme move or I want the student to work on something specific for their game. Ill often do the technique of the day in a live environment to at least one student.At lower levels I couldnt guide things as well but every time I made a mistake I made a mental note and sometimes I would recreate the problem after the roll if my partner was willing. Other times Id ask my black belt about the scenario and more often than not Id think back to the technique when I learned it and realize where my mistake was. Instead of drilling I was constantly analyzing the roll while it happened as best I could. When something unexpected or interesting happened it would stick out. The main problem with this style is it tends to be chaotic and all over the place and you have to be willing to deal with very uneven progress in different areas. Drilling removes that chaos. Now I can limit the chaos during free rolling with my students by depending on the skill differential. As I get good at something I tell them my triggers as well as how to ideally shut down what Im doing.Overall I have no regrets over not being a driller. At the same time I assume that drilling is a good default approach for most people.,bjj,d2so7d3,1,t5_2qn02

7489541,0,t1_d2tiby7,gt Of course without the quality of what I do suffering in the name of making a buck.Ok. STOP THIS THINKING!!! You need a mental shift more than business advice. This mindset will fucking destroy your business. You are associating making a buck with a negative concept. People who have this mentality will pour their hard work down the drain. It is very naive and it might be how you were raised but look it was wrong and it will make or break your business. Profit is not a dirty word. Look there are natural ups and downs to any business or economy you need to make a profit when the times are good to have savings that get you through the times that are bad. Im not saying buy a mansion and sports car you can reinvest it into the business and do things like hiring a business manager website guy marketing agency etc.... Making a buck has got to be a top priority because without it you cant offer ANY quality of teaching bad or good as youll have no place to teach it. Making a buck means getting new students interested it means being able to support your competition team it means having enough savings from profit so your gym can stay open through a recession or personal crisis  it means having a better quality website to bring students in it means being able to open another location so spread your BJJ further it means giving a stable future for your students so they arent turned out in the rain when you go belly up!Of course there is going to be a reduction in quality if you spend time on this... Stop thinking this is a problem. We arent talking about slashing your quality completed however if you have to teach at only  quality in order to use that free  to make the business profitable then its either that or your business withers and dies and youll keep wondering what you could have done differently.,bjj,d2tiqwz,7,t5_2qn02

7619386,0,t3_4jnqkr,Found this when I went looking for the history of black beltsThe first ranking system in Japanese arts was a merit system based on menkyo or licenses. Essentially you trained until you learned enough to earn a license recognizing your ability in that set of techniques or lessons. You may have a menkyo for each section of the syllabus mokuroku or you might have menkyo shoden menkyo chuden etc. Ultimately though this culminated in a final license menkyo kaiden license of full transmission.Kan Jigor  was the first to incorporate a system of Kyu and Dan into martial arts but this system actually originated in a chesslike game called Go Igo in Japanese Weiqi in Chinese. He split his students first into two ranks Unranked or mudansha and ranked or yudansha and instituted a belt system to recognize the difference between them. These were later divided into levels of Kyu white belt and Dan black belt based on the rankings in Go.The colored belts came after Judo began to be taught outside of Japan. Sensei Kawaishi Mikonosuke  introduced various colored belts in Europe in  when he started to teach judo in Paris. The story goes that he felt that the Europeans he was teaching needed some sort of encouragement to continue training and that a new belt at a new grade made the sport more appealing. This system was later adopted into various other martial arts taught throughout Europe but was also adapted into Karate by Funakoshi Gichin  attempting to increase Shotokan Karates appeal to the Japanese.,bjj,d38a996,5,t5_2qn02

I dont doubt that there are hapkidokaratetkdtma schools out there that are completely legit. Hell there might even be some that teach useful self defense curriculum and Im sure there are even more that would at least supplement other martial arts.  However  of the martial arts schools in my area are McDojos or glorified fitness centers that run ddly artz  evry or leern self defences in  hrs!!!! marketing schemes. Due to how widespread the hate is for TMAKravotherselfdefense is I imagine that the situation in my town is not all that uncommon.

7664527,0,t1_d3ddjhy,Its not a slight against Saulo. I love the Ribeiro style I myself have a very heavy TD  top game style and I use a lot of stuff from BJJ Library. My point was that you probably shouldnt say leg locks are easy to defend when guys as good as Saulo have been submitted by devoted leg lockers during the primes of their careers. My point was also not and is not that leg locks beat everything. Clearly they dont. In general the better grappler is going to win any match if they can force the match into their comfort zones guys like Galvao and Lepri have been dealing with leg locks plenty for years even if thats not the focus of their games and theyre better overall grapplers than Palhares or Tonon IMO. My point remains however that learning leg locks and getting good at them doesnt mean you cant also learn to have a good top game and that what order you learn those skills in really depends upon how important they are in the rule sets you plan to compete under. If youre going to be a sub only open rules competitor it makes perfect sense to get good at leg attacks and leg attack defense before you get good at passing. If youre an IBJJF guy then you should learn to play guard and pass guard before you mess around with legs much. Ideally youd eventually integrate your top game and leg attack game in such a way as to use both together in whatever way works best for your chosen field of competition. I primarily look to pass guard but I have spots where Ill leg lock and a lot of times its just using the threat of the leg lock to set up the pass or the sweep if were talking bottom game. In any case I see no real evidence that learning to leg lock early means you cant have a good top game. If youre only leg locking and never learning to pass you shouldnt be advancing in rank and your coach should be on you about it just like he should be on you if you only try to start on top every roll and never develop a guard. Being not well rounded is bad in general theres nothing special about being poorly rounded is that even a phrase? because you have good leg locks and suck at everything else. If you only berimbolo Id also criticize your game doesnt mean the berimbolo is bad to learn if you want to win sport BJJ matches.,bjj,d3devqz,2,t5_2qn02

7669948,0,t1_d3ds7r4,Honestly i think we are able to see much to little to fully establish how much he trains we see him fail a at takedowns twice being the one that ends up on the bottom against an opponent who is at least a foot taller than him and possibly much stronger. The next situation we see him in where he should be potentially using grappling skills to protect himself and try to take down his opponent is when he is being repeatedly slammed in the face he scrambles away the guy grabs his back and he shouts He is going for my gun! How do you know that when he is pummeling him in the face that he does not have his other hand on the handle of the officers gun trying to yank it out of its holster to shoot him? he could be there thinking There is probably backup on the way he odds of him beating me to death are much lower than the odds of me dying if he gets my gun. Once that thought locks into your brain you are going to hold on to that gun for dare life even if its not the right thing to do.I mean have you never gotten a good chance at a choke hold it for too long allowing your opponent to get a chance to sweep you or even place a submission on the arm youre using to secure one of the lapels because youre so sure youre gunna get the choke? It could very much be whats going on here.Then theres the fact of how quickly he starts screaming HELP! in a rather panicked voice You know could this be because he is facing a MUCH larger opponent whom he instantly realizes is muchmuch stronger than he is? While there are certainly a lot of situations out there where cops could use grappling skills to much more effectively apprehend a suspect or protect themselves this pitch black footage where  of the events are hidden behind the hood of the officers car is not a good example.,bjj,d3e11vm,1,t5_2qn02

I said you should spend more time in avoidance of the triangle.  The best escape is not getting into that position in the first place.  As white belts our main job is to survive and the best way is to get tapped and work backwards i.e. Got triangled how did it happen? Ahhh he broke my posture while in his guard.  K mental note focus on good posture.  ampnbsp    gtAs for the move itself.. it seem that advanced. Sure there are several steps to it but that goes for several basic moves like a triangle too.  Difference is the triangle is a one of the fundamentals and is easier than that escape.  Hence why your instructor taught it to you. I think its awesome and good for your development to search out for bjj resources i.e. youtube instructionals just be careful which you try out.  Run it by your instructor to make sure its cool.    ampnbsp    gtI can assure you that I am not spazzing out.   I said inadvertently because I truly believe you have the purest attentions at heart.

7725513,0,t1_d3k2zol,As far as setups go I can inbox you with a bunch of gifs if you like. The darce is the kimura of chokes and you dont have to have the inside track to get it. So basically anytime someone has an open elbow elbow away from their ribs you can get it. If you want to be more directsimple you can get it anytime someone presents their shoulder to your centerline or anytime you can bring your centerline facing someones shoulder. So when someone toreando passes theyre often driving their shoulder straight into you which is the angle you want. I try to have an entry on both arms from no matter where I am. So near side or far side from openbutterfly guard top side control bottom side control the top leg drag leg weave mount the front headlock side ride etc.Your nearside setups from the top are usually the safest because they dont require anyone to turn into you and you can hit them while theyre facing away from you.Just curious have you ever seen Jeff Glovers Darcepedia? I think Ryan Halls Arm Triangles set is the best for an overall understanding of the choke but in terms of setups and entries the Darcepedia cant be beat. ,bjj,d3kc4r4,2,t5_2qn02

7793802,0,t3_4m1l1w,Here is I have written when this topic comes upI have had  back surgeries microdiscectomy with laminectomy First was due to herniation of LL and LS. Second was due to reherniation of LSThe pain OH GOD THAT PAIN! was instantly gone after the surgeries. It no longer felt like my leg caught fire every time I stood up. All of the sudden it was no longer there. That is both a good thing No Pain! and a bad thing I feel better. Im going to roll.In both cases the recovery time for me was about  weeks. If you get the surgery I highly recommend not stepping on to the mat before at least  weeks. It will take at least that long for the disc to begin to scar over and even then wont heal as much as it can for another couple of months. At  weeks I was released to do light activity. To keep from going stir crazy I took up Pilates because of the emphasis on stretching range of motion and highreplowweight exercises. It actually helped my BJJ game a LOT. I had to modify some exercises trunk twists are a nono and the instructor made suggestions for alternative exercises.At  weeks I began to train again but in a very limited capacity. I chose to only roll with people smaller than me the likelihood of injury is reduced should either of you fall hard. I did slowrolling light positional maintenance and absolutely zero takedowns. I also completely avoided being in peoples guard sitting and twistingrotating is one of the absolute worst motions you can do with a recovering back. I gradually progressed on a weekly basis by adding in a little resistance and rolling with bigger people. I think I was back to rolling at full strength after about  months. BUT in the course of that time I learned a LOT about more technical aspects of the game hooks grips balance points posts etc.. that I would have taken me much longer had I been able to use more strength and resistance. It was a beneficial curse. PMy surgeries happened almost  years ago just before I got my blue belt. Ive been back to training  days a week.The only thing Ive modified in my game is my defense when people go to stack me. The compression of the spine paired with the impending rotationtorque is enough to worry me and get me to move. I used to fight through the stack shoulderwalking away and working feverishly to destroy their posture. Now I transition to sweeps a lot sooner than I would have before. The result is that my sweep game has improved a lot.Other than that I cant say my game has changed. Ive always played a light top game favoring mobility over pressure and a flexible bottom game halfguard is goto for some reason. ,bjj,d3s2y4u,4,t5_2qn02

7857434,0,t1_d3yikfh,Again knee injuries are extremely common in BJJ. Just because you dont have one doesnt mean the tournament rules should be designed around you. Ask around Im sure a lot of people you train with have previous MCL or ACL tears and you just never knew it. Watch gracieworlds video on knee reaping they explain why its illegal  because it bends the knee in an unnatural way. BJJ is the lowest risk combat sport AFAIK. If you want to learn how to defend yourself without getting kicked in the head its the obvious sport of choice. There are many people training well into their s. But I guess that doesnt matter since you dont have any knee injuries and are hardcore. We should do what you want. The knee is the largest joint I didnt just make that up its a often cited fact by physicians. The hip bones are large but the joint in them is small. They also are subject to less barely any lateral and torquing forces. The knee also has twice as many ligaments and moving parts as the hip.

IF the instructors are committed to keeping the gym a positive place to train Im speaking in general terms not about this specific case and the other stuff going on.Ive rolled with literally hundreds of people. The vast majority of the encounters Ive had have been positive. There have been some bad encounters. Thats going to happen anywhere that isnt a members only club where people need vetted before they get in and even then to be honest.  In my experience the bad guys dont tend to stick around all that long  and if they do stick around they become better.  Not were all friends now better but at least I can turn up train and ignore you because youre not disruptive or dangerous any more better.There are nasty people everywhere. In a sport like BJJ where the turnover is so high there will come a point where you turn up to your gym and realise that all the cool guys you train with have moved awayare injuredhave quithave changed teams. At that point the best you can hope for is that those guys set a good example and the newcomers are cool people too. If they failed to do that then thats when a once great gym can become a bad place to train.Ive lost my cool over bad behaviour from new guys on a few occasions   but for the most part those bad guys dont last. Either they quit the sport because of their egos or just like everyone else they get injured move away etc. I think it would be sad for someone to throw away a good gym and some good friendships over a few people.I agree re the instructors. In that case yeah things probably wont change and it makes sense to look for somewhere more suitable. ,bjj,d4a110x,2,t5_2qn02

8134324,0,t1_d4ua2bw,You shouldnt roll with super petite girls if going light bothers you. Youre too big in comparison to a smaller female to have much of intense roll and will be unsatisfied. They will have to exert much much more energy to escape you to the point that its not an equal fight. Equal or close to equal weight is very very different. Guys dont go light on me. They try to not put all their weight on me and throw me around like a rag doll because that evens the playing ground and protects me. They focus on the technical aspect of BJJ. Also in terms of competitiveness surrounding same sex sparring and competitions in general outside of jiu jitsu.... Its real lol. Its very very established in psychology that a male wont see me as a threat as he would a guy and vice versa for females. There is much more competion between same sex especially in terms of sparring. Im unsure why youre trying to argue that....Look at some of the above comments its agreed females experience more competition amongst themselves.No need to get defensive! Youre clearly very knowledgable lol,bjj,d4uddyc,1,t5_2qn02

So if you were someone who missed that monday or multiple you could never get one.They mean nothing for promotions.  You go from bluegtpurple or purplegtbrown when you win something or someone cares enough to promote.  The stripes dont matter.It ends up kind of comical because most people outside of the kids class do not wear them on their belts so you can have someone getting their like th stripe at purple.

Not only is that scientifically accurate The scientific element of this equation deals primarily with the way that an individuals reproductive biology operates. The distinction of whether one identifies as a man or a woman operates much more within the social norms of our society.gt a long existing paradigm that doesnt require a person to engage in group think to change the minds of billions to passify the needs of a few.Youre  right in that its a longstanding paradigm that doesnt require us to confer with one another as to whether its the right way to think about gender. That said paradigms shift and its reasonable to say that weve been watching them do so for the last century at least. Globally were seeing groups that have been historically marginalized to the point of lacking any meaningful voice significantly improve their opportunities for education social and professional mobility reproductive rights earning potential and the ability to be seen as equals within mainstream society.

Also as a woman I notice that my ribcage seems to be able to take less pressure than the guys I train with.

Maybe you can try to work on tight cage rather than heavy weight with those kind of training partners and work off your back?

8314483,0,t1_d5gtsn5,I think its very applicable. This seminar was in the Gi but the principles of control are still the same. Instead of using their lapel at shoulder height control their head. Of course the major difference is the reap but its still the same principle of clearing the foot off of the hip. I spend a lot of time personally playing SLX and my students are quite good at it too so I spend and equal amount of time defending itwe allow reaping in no Gi class. examples Cummins vs Tanquinho at Polaris If you watch a traditional guy like Tanquino whos excellent in the Gi and out of it against Eddie Cummings at Polaris he utilizes all the right principles. He clears the foot from the hip controls eddies head so Eddie cant hip in hand fights etc. Tanquino shut down the SLX very well in no Gi while trying to advance forward against an amazing guard player like Eddiewhos guard is near impossible to pass.  Vagner Rocha vs Gordon Ryan at SapateiroVagner does a great job at escaping and avoiding the reap from SLX however he never advanced past this. He blocks the reaping leg and jumps over Ryan but theres not really any pass attemptsagain I dont mean any naysay about Rocha obviously Gordan is a killerMoral of the story I do think Lepris instruction on shutting down and advancing past SLX is applicable in Gi and No Gi.

Attack with a straight ankle lock and they apply the boot. Shift your hips and pressure slightly and attack a heel hook. Make sure you extend and if they try to turn and pull their leg out they will be caught by your pinching legs and turn right into a kneebar.

8428936,0,t3_4uzm93,When I first started grappling I was told there were  ways to get promoted well  sort ofa.  Go compete up a belt level at a respected tournament and take st place.  You can win by points submissions whatever.  You just need to leave with gold.b.  Compete at your current belt level but you need to win every match by submission.  Even if you take first place but you won a match on advantages or points... thats great but no promotion..  You need to be smashing guys at your belt level on a consistent basisyou should be the best ltcolorgt belt in the room.Personally I liked that criteria because it sets a very defined standard of what you need to do.  Are you smashing or getting smashed?  It made things pretty black and white.  Plus this way it was merit based.  I looked at it like this if Im hiring someone for a job I want the guy who is skilled and good at what he does meaning proficient as well as knowledgeable.

I think theres a degree to which you can either think Im gonna show this new blood what a real white belt looks like GRRRRR! or you can see how little effort you can put into the problem of controlling them. If its a weedy person with no weight and no coordination then you may never find that minimum level some people really do just fall over in a stiff breeze. But if you get overpowered you can see where it was going right and where it went wrong. The true beginner cant do that.

8474813,0,t1_d60va3l,Yup I agree with your points. I wont add any but with regard to the first and third points I would advise that you avoid planning your goals in nonspecific terms. Dont plan what you are going to improve. Identify what you want to improve and then plan what you are actually going to do to improve it. For example if I want to work on improving my game from a certain position I will start by identifying the specific combination of complimentary techniques that I want to use from that position. Note It is absolutely crucial that you have a credible and accessible source for any technique that you want to use be it your instructor or a credible instructional. Once the moves for the game I want to work on have been decided upon I plan drilling sessions with specific repetition goals for each technique until my execution against a compliant opponent is satisfactory. Once this level has been reached I move on to a new topic with my drilling but I will start trying to force the new game on my opponents during every sparring session until I feel completely comfortable using it against a resisting opponent. Once this has been achieved I move on to the next area of focus.Rinse repeat. With only  months under your belt you should feel free to specialize in whatever area of BJJ you want. Fundamentals refers to principles not moves. Just make sure you specialize in something and the fundamentals will begin to grow.gt Edit As to immediate feedback BJJ does that all by itself.,bjj,d60w5sl,3,t5_2qn02

Its not just the weight but the control grips of the head that prevents this whether its a chin cup or an arm triangle or just the weight of your torso while you hook behind their arms or around their trunk.If someone is going to release the grips on a front headlock enough to go for a spin behind they should not only be pushing the head down andor away but be moving with enough purpose that a somersault would not place them back in the other guys guard.

I think if you focus on those and then tangle the free leg whenever its presented then any of the attacks are viable.

8550422,0,t3_4wuky0,The Clark Gracie collar choke from there is a good one that uJeremySkinner linked to. I particularly like forcing them to roll and  getting the armbar you have to keep your knees pinched tightly together. Theres the obvious triangle if they turn back in and an inverted single leg x sweep if they stand because theyre way bigger and soooo strong. A wrist lock will be the easiest way to get the finish. The Musumecis do a pretty cool back take from there too. Speaking of Musumecis you can also grab that far arm if they give it to you for a shoulder lock on that side. There are just so many options. Worst case scenario its just a sweep into side control. Personally I find it easiest to finish the omoplata by being perpendicular to my opponent and putting my weight through my shin right above their elbow. My other leg is usually under their neck. I can either get the tap with this use my arm to lift their hand for more kimura pressure. Thats just what works for me though.,bjj,d6adift,2,t5_2qn02

I shoot for windows of  hours of eating.  After messing around I feel like theres not perfect set time.  Your body is your body its going to do what it wants so as long as you have longer then normal fasting windows I think you will be fine.  I know Martin Berkhan Leangains pushes a  hour fasting window he also talks about how the meal coming out of your fast is the most important.  So if youre training at night I could see breaking a fast at pm with a sizable meal a light pretraining snack followed by a post train meal before bed.  Ive even seen reports on how eating carbs before bed now help you recover and make Growth Hormone at night.

Try to lose or at least diminish your ego it sounds like this guy is a better at grappling than you. At least in a rolling aspect you are likely more knowledgeable and rounded at BJJ.Dont be offended by that there are reasons for this it sounds like he has a great deal of experience in wrestling and those old USSR countries are no joke.  For example Khabib and a lot of other UFC fighers are from Dagestan.As others have stated wrestling is grappling.  Even though he he only goes twice a week he has been training grappling for a long period of time it sounds like so he can pick up techniques a lot quicker than your average person.  Also he is likely a high level athlete and I would guess a lot stronger faster more explosive coordinated etc than you. as far as technique goes When in scarf try to get control back of your arm that he is controlling.  This Firas video should helpAlso it should be noted that experienced wrestlers are beasts and once they learn some basic submission defense they can be a nightmare to deal with especially for not as athletic BJJ guys.

Itll take a few weeks before it feels normal again and a month or two before you can handle a toe hold without repeating the entire healing process.  Dont sweat it. Its a spooky but minor injury that youll fully recover from with rest alone. Ive seen tons of them and had one myself the prognosis has been nearly the same every time.  Just remember heel hooks target a lot of parts of the body with nearly no pain receptors. If theres pressure you cant get away from its time to tap.,bjj,d6u7vrj,1,t5_2qn02

8711753,0,t3_4zaou2,White belt here. Been doing BJJ for  months now. I have a little wrestling under my belt previously and am really good shape fitness wise coming into BJJ. My Ive always been a fitness freak so fitness regimen already included work outs that are conducive to BJJ or wrestling.. Lots o kettle bell work sprinting calesthenics Stretching ect. So against most whites amd some blues I find myself getting into good positions and not knowing how to finish. One I find myself in a lot is taking the back and getting the hooks in. Almost every time as soon as I get hooks in they will defend the choke by crossing the arms in front of them and trying to roll into turtle defense or they will slip into half guard while Im messing around trying to figure out how to finish. I understand I am supposed to straighten them out and not allow them to roll to turtle or bridge up on top of me but how am I supposed to get a choke in with them crossing their arms like that? ,bjj,d6ult6v,1,t5_2qn02

EXACT same thing for me it hurts to sleep on my side a lot or twist my body but the pain isnt really back pain but its right where I assume my ribs are connecting.All of the symptoms it lists it hits and its not quite as broad as webmd like the fact that it says the pain is in the left side of your breast bone check sharp aching  pressure like check Affects more than one rib DEFINITELY check because thats one thing was that its not really a specific rib pain but the whole ribcage area in the back of the sternum feels sore.And worsens when you take a deep breath it hurts to take a deep breath sitting or standing. At least now I might have a basis to see a doctor and explain what I think I might have.The awkward thing with this sort of injury is that I dont want to be going in and be like I should get like a chest xray Im hurt. But Im also not great at vocalizing what I suspect. It can be excruciating pain but usually only for moments like... When im taken down in BJJ and I land on my side or someone going like side mount on my left side. One of my buddies finally learned how to tap me out with this shit he just would get me in hard pressure only when he gets frustrated and its all in good fun.,bjj,d6ykm1f,2,t5_2qn02

The reason for this is jiu jitsu encourages you to be conformable on your back which is a huge nono.The second part is true but it also depends on what type of jiu jitsu gym you train at. Some gyms incorporate some basics of wrestling like shooting in for takedowns sitouts and so on. We have several wrestlers at our school and our instructor encourages them to show their techniques and knowledge as it pertains to wherever you might find yourself in a jiu jitsu match.If you go to a school that is big on guard especially gi dependent guards then probably not so much.,bjj,d7lj21u,7,t5_2qn02

8945292,0,t3_52qi6d,I recently returned to Jiujitsu at a local gym. We train no gi its more of an MMA gym really. Because I am new again we start off in a beginners class then intermediate.So at my last class we discussed belts and promotions. We were told that we should get some MMA shorts with a white belt on it. It was explained that a white belt has some skills but little to no experience. A blue belt would be fairly competent compared to a white belt but not a purple belt.My question is given I am at an MMA gym and we do not train in a gi is getting a white belt less of a deal? Or maybe as I have thought having these white belt shorts is just to catagorize the new and less experienced? I ask because I honestly would rather work for my first belt.

9090619,0,t1_d84gz43,Yes the problem somewhat restated is that most BJJ guys who enter MMA dont have great wrestling. If you dont have good wrestling you need to develop it. Maia did that GSP did that and they have had a lot of success. Penn his whole career mostly used his BJJ reactively and it got him in trouble when he couldnt take down people who were beating him on the feet ala Edgar. The idea that a bottom game is missing I dont think is the answer. Mostly because being on bottom in MMA is just a terrible idea. Youre not going to catch many subs against other experienced fighters but you are going to catch a lot of punches. The bottom game in MMA has moved towards using BJJ andor wrestling to get back to your feet and rightly so. You are not going to be an effective BJJ athlete in MMA by starting from the bottom those days are long gone. People dont give up stupid subs and if youre on the bottom just throwing up subs and the top guy is doing damage hes going to win rounds again rightly IMO. I think the only people who have some success with a very bottom oriented game are leg lock experts but even that sort of approach seems to have a ceiling based on the admittedly small number of guys weve seen try it. Its hard to get past the fact that gravity helps the guy on top whos throwing punches and if hes careful hes going to wear you down and not get subbed in the majority of fights.,bjj,d84jnlf,7,t5_2qn02

Of course this is true but according to up to date science the correlation the difference they make in effect between lowhigh rep and strength is very lowly muscle mass strictly correlates with strength. The way to gain this muscle mass is not really important. There may be a slightly difference but its according to studies minimal.So Im not really sure if that really is the difference I dont think so.

Can you keep up with other blues on the mat. And second when youre keeping up with other blues or anyone for that matter are you using your jiu jitsu intead of athleticism.

As for half guard being tall and heavy half guard top is a place I like to play but if you can get a strong half guard game it seems easier for smaller guys and the smaller the easier to get out from my side control and into half guard because of the distance from my hip to my knee.  They can slide their knee in.  That usually requires a ton of squirming in order to free whatever block I have on the hip but it can open up. ,bjj,d8dlqmi,6,t5_2qn02

9165489,0,t3_55u5cp,I started watching competitive bjj right after starting to train.  I found a few cool styles to emulate early.  I would watch matches from Marcello Lovato Jr and Kron trying to use a little bit of what they were doing.  It barely worked out for a long time and I was getting frustrated Why cant I keep my opponent controlled? Was something that came up in my head alot whether I couldnt finish a sub or get a pass.So one day I went home defeated after practice and found a match I hadnt seen one of Bernardos.  I remember watching him pull deep half and then proceed to control THE WHOLE MATCH.  I was hooked.  That night I watched probably like  hours of footage and noticed that over undergrip.Went in to practice the next night and almost passed everyone with a similar skill levels guard.  They couldnt really stop it and I was barely good at it.Fast forward to now when I go to other gyms and roll with their white and blue belts they feel so unprepared when I get the overunder.

Not saying he should have landed on her but anyone that close in your personal space in an aggressive situation is a threat imo. Forget a knife Ive seen a girl slash a guy in the face with a set of keys because he didnt respect the threat someone poses when theyre determined to do harm and think theyre immune to retaliation.

9354997,0,t3_58mu30,There are two main variable that affect this ability. These are weightathletic ability and skill. In an extreme case I would have a really hard time believing that a lb woman blue maybe almost purple belt could subdue or even get away from a lb muscular untrained man. But I do believe that a lb woman black belt could. But there are so many other small variables. Does the woman just do sport jiujitsu or does she train her self defense a lot? Is the man trying to kidnap her? rape her? kill her? Is the attacker a muscular lb or a chain smoking overweight lb?All in all most of us train with a sense even small that we may have to use these technique in a real life situation hopefully with an outcome of ending up safe. The techniques we learn will facilitate that as this is a martial art. And it is way better to know something than nothing at allOn a size on size basis I personally feel that I became capable of beating most untrained people when I hit  stripes on my blue belt. The day it happened I tapped a lb D college starting defensive end with a triangle choke. I am about lb and I never hit triangle chokes.

Theres tutorials all over every rock climbing site its pretty much just mounting plywood to the front of the thing. Then you can buy a grab bag of holds and change them up whenever you get bored or want to hang a different position. If you dont mind the money of course there are lots of prebuilt ones that still hang in a doorway like that.You have to be careful with hangboards though you can injure your fingers training on them easily. Generally in rock climbing its not recommended to even start using them till youve been climbing about a year and all your tendons and such get beefed up.

9560310,0,t3_5bsbhu,Very interesting! especially that pinky grip.The big thing I have noticed isThere are actually two different orientations in each of Saddle and outsideashi and these necessitate different controls though there is a mirroring between saddle and outside ashi.The outside Ashi details Ashi  Here your opponent is sitting on the hip that you have entangled turned in towards your back. You get the best pressure from a scissoring motion with the legs. This motion is actually in opposition to crossing your feet though the DDS keep their feet crossed  which is useful for defense and to maintain position if the opponent manages to partially clear the pin. By keeping elbowarmpit pressure on the top of the foot you end up with  pieces of opposing pressure downward on the foot upward under the calfknee and downward on the thigh. I think the strongest finish here is belly down which is not what DDS teaches but is what they often doAshi  Here the opponent has started to get up on the opposite hipfoot and is trying to spinrotate the knee out. The leg motion is different here and the triangle is optimal for pressure. There are two major keys here to maintaining pressure a Dont pinch your knees! Instead your outside leg should be applying pressure pulling down your inside ankle which is also on the outside this forms a bite on the thigh of the leg you are attacking with your inside thighknee. b Dont try to pull with your inside knee or retracting your hips instead use a bit of hip extension. The hip extension serves two purposes. First it applies counter pressure to the back of the calf with the upper thigh of your outside leg  this gives the same  pieces of opposing pressure as before. Second it also lifts your weight slightly off the mat and attaches you to the opponent via their leg. This means when they roll you roll with them and the orientation of their knee with respect to your entanglement doesnt change you need to be comfortable here basically rolling across your face.

If you watch his matches you can see that he doesnt worry that much about trapping the whizzer arm because he has such a strong grip on the hips and such a strong leg torque that the rollover sweep is easy. If youre doing it right he shouldnt be able to base. A good example is hereHe doesnt try to trap the whizzer arm at all but Clarks hips are so out of position that he cant defend even with the post.

But its way easier to get the RNC for example as youre taking the back. Whenever I teach back attacks in nogi I encourage people to tack on a submission as theyre throwing in their nd hook or body triangle on each rep. ,bjj,da1ehzk,6,t5_2qn02

9651503,0,t3_5d9esl,Awesome idea. Ive done similar with putting hands in belt but that can be dangerous and doesnt really allow you to defend or substitute your grip for other movements. Definitely recommending this next class.  ,bjj,da2qxnd,2,t5_2qn02
9653332,0,t1_d9z4h13,MMA is substantially different from combat bjj because so much changes when the rules of engagement change. MMA is about as close as you can get to a streetfight in a relatively safe and productive way. Probably the biggest change you could do to mma training to make it more applicable to a streetfight is to put more emphasis on throws and on keeping your distance. The effectiveness of judostyle throws is lessened in mma due to the fight taking place on a padded mat. And in a streetfight you can try to avoid getting into an allout fight by keeping your distance using a lot of teeps anglingoff and other things that might get you a foul for timidity in an mma match.Training combat bjj in a way that keeps it visibly identifiable as bjj would require restricting striking so much that the training would a minimal improvement over sport bjj. And it will be restricted not just by the approach to technique training but also by the skillset of your fellow students. If your use of striking in training doesnt go beyond performing strikes simply for the sake of letting your partner defend against them you wont get very good at performing strikes. And if youre not very good at striking your training partner wont be skilled at defending against a good striker.Train striking to get good at striking in a fight and you and your training partners will be better skilled at defending them. ,bjj,da2z2c0,1,t5_2qn02

9662773,0,t1_da44ffk,Thats a bit of a freak injury but the best way to prevent that is a combination of improvded grapevine technique and position management. If you are grapevining you should be doing so actively with your opponents legs stretched out with yours. Them straightening their legs shouldnt put pressure on your knee.But once you have the position settled you should usually give up the grapevine to go to standard mount or tech mount on bigger guys. The grapevine is just to pressure through the initial escape attempt or solidify your position.In  years Ive never picked up even a mild injury from using the grapevine.,bjj,da450n8,2,t5_2qn02

9694832,0,t1_da7wdea,In response lets look at cricket. Look at the turn out for male odis vs female odis. The numbers are a fraction of what the guys get. The ropes are put further in the field and the scoring generally isnt as high. The fans dont get the excitement of a massive hit into the crown because the females just cant hit it as a hard and in turn this reflects on viewer turn out.I dont know about you but I didnt start bjj to make money. Nor any other sport for that matter. Money is a side product of being good at the sport. I doubt that is a contributing factor for female interest. Get more females involved then let competitive selection show if the best females draw attention to warrant the same money.Capitalism really isnt that discriminatory. If the same money could be made off of showing female NBA games as the male NBA games. It would have the same coverage. Im never going to call viewing bias sexism.Edit.

9715890,0,t3_5e8ik2,U gotta completely embrace it. I went through the same thing. Not so much hated it but I refused to embrace it. I thought relying on the gi and grips would mess me up for mma or real life so I literally refused to do anything with the gi. No spider guard no collar chokes I still did everything like nogi like grabbing the wrist and back of the neck.But I saw a video of Jose aldo and he was talking about he loves training in the gi and he started showing moves from spider guard and it made me realize u dont have to be so against the gi. Have fun its jiujitsu not mma or wrestling just treat it like another sport and fully embrace it  and u will learn to love the gi and it will even start making u better at nogi. I used to refuse to believe that but it really does. It makes your base so much better cuz u get used to someone pulling on u and doing all the weird sweeps with the gi grips and also everything is done with technique u cant just wiggle out of things and get lucky like nogi. U have to know how to escape or u will be stuck. That friction is real. So it really forces u to do everything the proper way with technique. So go in there like u really wanna do it even if u gotta fake it. When u roll start going for all the grips sleeves collar etc. Play spider guard pull the lapel out and act like youre keenan Cornelius. Start tugging and pulling and breaking grips. Just cuz u do nogi doesnt mean u have to disregard the gi its two different things so treat it as such and just have fun with it. I love the gi now.

9813068,0,t1_damn5kx,Trying to reach out to people that may not have access to BJJ whether due to location living environment constraints or even economics.  On an old forum might have been even theirs someone asked if they could still take the test even if their DVD wasnt purchased from them pirated and they said it didnt matter as long as they understood the material.Their technical bluebelt the Gracie Combatives covers some good principles and techniques for basic self defense against an untrained opponent.  Getting people to train an organized curriculum and have some reward at the end is better than nothing.BJJ is getting more and more widespread but that wasnt always the case.  There are a lot of people out there that wanted to learn but didnt have the opportunity to go  times a week to a local gym and pay  plus a month.  I dont know how many times the question is asked on this sub about not being able to train and is there any videos out there to learn from.  One of the most common answers is their DVDs.Is it as legit as an actual blue belt.  No way.  But it does get BJJ out there to people that otherwise wouldnt have access.  And maybe they will get hooked and one day step into a real gym.And their Bullyproofing program for kids is awesome too.If they are making money more power to  them.  They arent charging outrageous prices.And for the  record I dont train there or have ever met them or anything like that.  ,bjj,damo5at,14,t5_2qn02

Youre most likely to go to the De La Riva school. Also that gym has to pay premium to De La Riva as he is like using the name. Usually if they become affiliate if De La Riva has a specific set of curriculum that gym will follow.

9880060,0,t1_davcy1d,True but Im not talking about him focusing on submissions but rather being conscious that they exist. Being in the exact same mentality as him half a year ago I realized when I started thinking about attacking as well as transitioning that things open up even if your end goal isnt to finish your opponent. As an example I have someone in my guard and Im not looking to throw triangles only to sweep. But he keeps blocking everything. Now I see an opening for a triangle and go for it. I fail because its my first triangle. The armbar is still there. Fail that because its my first armbar. All the sudden I got the omoplata. Maybe I wont finish it but Im sure as hell gonna use it to advance position which is what I was trying to do to start with. So not only does this open my mind to recognizing when I have an attack but it also allows me to reflect on the basic mistakes I made when I didnt finish the triangle or the armbar where if I had only thought defensively I wouldnt be exposed to these thinking patterns till way later.,bjj,dave8ce,2,t5_2qn02

Mma grappling is mixture of bjj wrestling catch etc. Its well suited to self defence but of course depends on how its taught and to whom. In the gi bjj is a sport and also interesting and exiting in its own way. Submission grappling no gi is just that. Why shouldnt people go for leg locks from seated position when there is no striking? Its the most effective manner for that rulesets. Original bjj if you like was mainly in gi and generally against untrained opponents. It has evolved with time as it should to refine itself. Saying the old way is the best is a tma attitude and doesnt encourage progress and refinement. Grappling is the most evolving of all fighting styles amd we should encourage this in all its forms. ,bjj,day2oup,1,t5_2qn02

9989730,0,t3_5ijgxa,Successll hinge on your ability to stay motivated amp disciplined and your ability to tolerate being hungry day after day.  Its a tough thing to do.  Id suggest developing a few habits thatll help keep you on track weigh yourself daily before you eat or drink anything and track that number dont worry too much about minor blips focus on the overall trend.  Pick a couple of BJJ highlight videos to watch whenever you feel your discipline flagging collect a photo album of ripped bodies or motivational memes or whatever on your phone to scroll through whenever you need a little boost.  Let your wife and people at your gym know what your goals are and explicitly ask for them to support you and hold you accountable.  ampnbspRegarding dieting tips Id recommend finding a few meals of high quality foods that give you the mix of nutrients youre looking for high on proteins amp fats low on carbs and repeating those meals day after day. An app like MyFitnessPal can help you figure out nutrient amp calorie counts and you can track everything there if it helps you stay disciplined.  If your wife can be convinced remove everything you dont want to be eating from your house.  Itll feel like a waste of money but give it away or trash it.  Some people have had great results with Intermittent Fasting google it and it may be an easier way to manage the hunger.  And Id recommend training on an empty stomach and not taking in any calories for a couple hours afterwards you may feel surprisingly exhausted but youll get used to it and it forces your body to tap into your stored fat for energy.  If youve got weighins the day before definitely look into the water loadingcutting strategy that NMND posted and do at least one test cut several weeks beforehand. And just commit to drinking  water why dick around? Also look at your calendar and plan some ridiculously gluttonous cheat days line them up with social events holidays travel etc. and make sure theres at least one a month maybe even one a week.  Most people have a way easier time suffering through calorie depletion if they know that theyll periodically get to stuff themselves with their fantasy food.  Itll help your motivation and help your body stay in a fat burning mode.  ampnbspAnd try to keep things in perspective  months will feel like an eternity but its a tiny portion of your life. Keep the tournament in perspective also its just a silly event where people meet up and roll to figure out the pecking order of the day.

The technical difference between a white and a brown is vast to the point that they shouldnt have to resort to leg attacks. Secondly leg attack defenses are in themselves intricate and arent often taught so basically the upper belts are attacking you with an offensive maneuver that you have no idea how to defend.

10106480,0,t1_dbop6gq,I doubt it. I dont think complexity is what wins titles. When I think of the legendary champs most had pretty simple games that they were able to implement on anyone. Its not universal Caio Terra has a weird game Buchecha just seems to make things up as he goes along but guys like Roger Gracie Marcelo Garcia Romulo Barral you see them doing the same things over and over. Even someone with a less conventional game like Rafa Mendes mostly repeats the same positions over and over theyre just positions he innovated a lot in so they carry a probably undeserved reputation for being complex. I think Kron just wasnt quite as good as his competition at the point where he gave up competitive BJJ.

Also belly down arm bars are pretty unfancy and basic so i think the issue is the guys mind set more than anything. Just remember coaches are students too teaching and creating a system is not an easy task give him some feed back and let him know how you feel about his perception of your game. If you cant communicate with your coachtraining partners learning and growth becomes stunted.,bjj,dbtc92z,1,t5_2qn02

10154424,0,t3_5leb35,Neither as they both ignore attitude and aptitude.I go to an academy where the class is small enough that the blackbelt professor personally knows all of his students. He pairs us up against each other and frequently rolls with us to determine where we are and how were doing. Its his judgement call to make when students are ready to advance and we all respect that.Where attendance or hours fails is that there are some gifted students that start who have backgrounds in other martial arts and are already ahead. For example  months after I started someone with a lot of Judo experience started as a new BJJ white belt. It took him just a week or so before he was dominating all the other white belts  when he arrived he already had the right mindset and a lot of the tools he needed to be competitive. Hes already a Blue belt which is deserved as that is where his skill level at BJJ is while Im just on my rd stripe as a White despite putting in more mat time overall. And this is also deserved because none of this comes naturally to me at all.And where the test fails is that the students attitude is also important. When receiving a belt it is important that the student reflects and upholds the values of the academy to other students and to other competitors when competing. It doesnt matter if someone knows all the moves and can pass a test if theyre an asshole to their classmates or disrespectful at competitions. Belts are more than just the ability to do the moves.,bjj,dbv26m3,17,t5_2qn02

10162212,0,t3_5leb35,Your instructor should know whether or not you are ready for a particular promotion. This should not require either a test or an attendance log. Franchise schools graded by someone who is not the students regular instructor can be more challenging but if the local instructor is doing his job this should still be manageable as they can brief the head instructor on their own students performance.I was awarded all my belts after grading days. I personally like the ceremonial aspect of a day where everyone gets tested en masse. Those days were some of my favourites at my academy and I feel they help create a tighter bond between students.A couple of times I was awarded a higher rank than I expected. I also underwent one informal assessment towards purple where I agreed with the instructor assessing me that I wasnt ready.I have failed students going for blue on a couple of occasions. These tests were set up by other people. Both times the guys were obviously floundering and both agreed that they did not deserve blue belts. I gave these guys some tuition and things to practice and both did eventually attain their blue belts.Im a bit bemused at white belts on this thread pontificating on how promotions should be conducted TBH.,bjj,dbvxyp3,1,t5_2qn02

Every time you pick up a position of technique you learn there are  more nuances to that position or technique.

Pulling the crown one way and pushing the chin the other gives you control of your opponents spine giving you just enough space to pummel your hands underneath your opponents chin which you can frame on getting space for underhooks.

10315227,0,t3_5np16s,One thing you have to look at is risk and reward. In MMA if you have someones back its the best place you can be. You can punch them they cant punch you you can submit them and they cant submit you. Pretty great. In a sport like Jiu Jitsu the back is also a great place but in a match where youre up on points maybe and you want to get the finish the risk of losing position going for that armbar can outweigh the risk. If you fail youll lose position and may end up on bottom but if youre ahead on points you can still win and you wont take any damage by losing position in grappling. Contrast that with MMA where if you go for that armbar and youre both shirtless sweaty and wearing gloves the risk of losing it increases and the risk is much greater. If you end up on bottom it doesnt matter how many points you have youre going to get punched in the face and will risk not only losing the match but also concussion or serious injury. Its not that people cant pull submissions off in MMA its that its too dangerous especially from dominant positions. ,bjj,dcdacn9,4,t5_2qn02

10373836,0,t3_5ojltz,Im a fella so I cant offer any insight from personal experience but one of my training partners went through a pregnancy on the mats and everyone turned out happy and healthy.  She sat down and had a conversation with our instructor earlyon he may have been the first person outside of her immediate family to know and he began hand picking her rolling partners.  Right about the  month mark she told everyone and we celebrated and kinda mentally wrapped her belly in bubble wrap.  She still worked out hard but she tailored her warmups to include a bunch of passive amp active hip stretches and she cut out any inversion stuff and anything that involved twisting or putting pressure on her abdomen. We all joked about there being an invisible force field around her womb and some days she talked about being exhausted but most people wouldnt have known that there was anything special going on.  She started tapering off after the  month mark removing any semblance rolling with speed or intensity and eventually she spent her class time stretching and chatting on the sidelines.  Now shes got a wonderful healthy toddler running around and it felt great for us to support her and be a part of her process I think it kinda brought our whole school together.

10382253,0,t1_dchug71,This may not be your problem but a good number of hamstring injuries are caused by quad dominance. So for instance if you were to leg press a lot and never squat this would actually increase your injury risk. The solution is to train the posterior chain squats and deadlifts are ideal. A lot of lumbar injuries are caused not by hamstring shortness but by iliacus and psoas shortening due to posture and genetics. The problem presents seemingly has hamstring shortness inability to touch the floor and it partly IS TBH but often the main problem is really the iliopsoas and the BEST way to fix that is with YogaforBJJs King Arthur Stretch or what Kelly Starrett calls the couch stretch.,bjj,dckw54a,2,t5_2qn02

10402721,0,t3_5oz5in,Well the short answer to the compete. That said if you dont want to be considered a hobbyist what do you want to be? A serious competitor or a professional? Well one can be a serious competitor and still be considered a hobbyist. One thing about how your instructor see things compared to how you see it is very much different. Aside from your intention that it does not  sound like you have told your instructor. Allow me to throw a possible curve ball to you. What if you tell your instructor you intent for the extra time that will be available and want to really show your commitment. Have you thought about how it may come off? Or what if they say here is the training schedule for the comp team and you cant make it through a session. I see a lot of talk about intent to be a competitor with out really talking about entering a tournament. My advice is to enter a tournament first. You can tell your instructor that you are serious but they wont believe it until they see that you are serious. To in instructor having a student of  months being a hobbyist is much better than seeing them as a quitter when it comes to what they teach. Imagine if you rolled with a brand new person and you hear is about how they want to fight MMA and how serious they are about it. Well say they come to a hand full of jiujitsu classes and quit because they could not handle the reality of getting tapped by a hobbyist and novice.,bjj,dcn7rjp,1,t5_2qn02

10447500,0,t3_5pm3lr,I am going to approach this from the perspective of the obese grappler.  At  and  I am pretty much the poster child.First off you are correct that weight loss is usually a natural consequence of hard training.   For the vast majority of people hard training combined with reasonably clean eating will lead to serious weight loss.  For some however medical issues may limit their ability to lose weight.  In my case I have a thyroid disorder that makes losing weight very difficult and causes me to put on unbelievable amounts of weight when it goes out of whack.  Combine that with a serious back problem that limits the types of cardio that I can do and losing any weight becomes a very serious challenge.  My situation while not common is also not unique and may account for some larger athletes. I am certainly not a world class professional I started Jiu Jitsu at  but do pretty well in age group competitions.  There are not many that you would call obese that compete at the highest levels of Jiu Jitsu but they do exist.  One example would be Luiz Pedro. As far as whether it can ever be and advantage the answer is mixed.  Being heavier than your opponent can certainly be an advantage.  If you know how to use that weight it becomes even more so.  If I get on top of someone their odds of getting out are much lower than against most smaller players.  It can also be an advantage when you are on the bottom.  Because the distance between my chest and the floor is so high it is hard for opponents to keep their hips low and apply good pressure.   Likewise few people can mount me and keep both knees on the floor.  I can an do take full advantage of these situations.Those advantages come at a huge price though.  The tradeoffs come in the areas of cardio and mobility.  Both muscle and fat require oxygen.  For really big guys with a great deal of both cardio can be a big issue.  Mobility even more so.  I simply cant move like a little guy.  Even really mobile big guys like Luiz Perdro who I mentioned above cant move like they could if the were lighter.  I believe that a Jiu Jitsu game can be created for any body type.  I have worked hard to build one that I can play well and think that I have done a pretty good job of doing so.  That said I think that my Jiu Jitsu would be that much better if I could lose  pounds.Edit just fixing typos...,bjj,dcsbayc,12,t5_2qn02

10460942,0,t1_dcttzht,I think BJJ already does a great job of appealing to the wrestling community. One of the reasons why I decided to join BJJ was because the BJJ fighter just about beats the wrestler . Not only does BJJ incorporate the takedown and control aspect of wrestling but the submission aspect makes it that much more enticing. Plus I had to give up on wrestling because of the very nature of the sport. I love grappling but wrestling is full throttle every single practice. My senior year...the day before states our coach was making us run  miles nonstop push ups and  minutes of live wrestling. I was so banged up at states that I didnt take a shot the whole tournament. BJJ allows me to enjoy grappling again without the injury prone intensity of wrestling. Plus I get to finally choke people. All the moves that were illegal in wrestling I get to do now?

10482946,0,t3_5q33g2,Doctor wrestler and BJJ practitioner here.  The short answer is the better you get at BJJ the less injuries you will have.  As you master techniques youll find yourself forcing less positions and the roll is will slowly start to become a process you dictate.  The whole point of the sport is to control and submit your opponent using the least amount of brute strength and force required.  It can be a rough go early on.  This is true of any sport.  Except for the ears you could have the same injuries from almost any sport.  Its better to be in cardiovascular shape and lose weight than not.  We all know how hard it is to find an activity we enjoy but is also good for us.  Your ears might get a little ugly you might get a rash now and then you may get some musculoskeletal injuries.  For me the feeling I get from BJJ outweighs the minor injuries.  ,bjj,dcwcma6,1,t5_2qn02
10483511,0,t1_dcwe5zp,Excellent question and I was just speaking to a new white belt male last night about something similar. With the stress that comes from being a smaller practitioner theres going to more than your share of uncomfortable situations. Two of my earliest hurdles to overcome were as follows  my posture being controlled inside someones closed guard where they break your head posture down and pull you into their chest and hug your head early natural white belt tactics and  being on bottom side control with not just shoulder pressure but my face being covered by shoulder and gi. It took me a while but whenever I got in those positions I had to teach myself not to panic. To realize I could breath and I could think and maybe not move exactly how I wanted but as mat time accumulated and escapes became part of my arsenal then I could execute. Or not. But the biggest victory was the mental battle I won with myself regarding realizing I could breath and that I was keeping myself safe. Each bad position will become more familiar everyday and the fear in each bad spot will lessen.,bjj,dcwexgy,9,t5_2qn02

I never had the vomiting but Ive had the other symptoms.  Those symptoms sound exactly like an aural migraine.   You get tunnel vision aka loss of peripheral vision or youll have one spot in your vision that is just blocked.  The light bulb or horizontal lines is what I call an electric squiggle.  Usually it starts off as the lightbulb spot and then it becomes a horizontal squiggle that looks electrified or dazed.  Those symptoms generally pass after  minutes and then the headache sets in.    Each time this happened it was after not having proper nutrition and being way over exerted.    From my research it sounded like a migraine.  Ive also had the same thing happened once or twice while being super stressed at work.   I would wake up with a lingering headache the next day but not a terrible one like you described.

10577132,0,t1_dd5ygy8,I call them hacks but more appropriately they are simply fitness challenges with myself. Too many dudes think bench pressing lbs is an impressive feat which it is...but it doesnt translate to real life strength and efficiency. Ive developed little  day systems to push myself and maximize physical outcomes. I may do  days of HIIT training then  days of pilates or bikram yoga followed by  days of body weight training etc. There are some really badass personal trainers where I live so I originally leaned on them for guidance and then took it from there. I find that the  day period is enough time to shock my body and keep me motivated for a short term goal. Im not one to continually do the same shit day in and day out. Another caveat...these little  day hacks put me in fantastic shape for BJJ.

10737550,0,t3_5tki6j,. If you are reacting to comment which has to do with somebody from EBI saying its bogus that blues and purples get superfights and get paid I stand by my comments. Some of them are better than black belts more popular and deserve to be paid. Anybody that says otherwise in this case  somebody from EBI  is wrong in my opinion and I am willing to put together matches that showcase it....and get people paid. It is a pet peeve of mine when people undermine how good elite bluepurple belts are. I dont know everything but I do know that these guys would wreck many black belts. . If you are upset at the statistics I gathered about win rate No Gi worlds that puts th planet in an unfavorable light I am sorry but I didnt make up the data. This does not mean there are not many talented people in th planet..  I really like EBI and what Eddie Bravo does for Jiu Jitsu. Hes innovative with techniques and provides an alternate competitive outlet for different types of grapplers who want to make it in BJJ. I went to one event and it was well run and fun. I think that his event is the most innovative thing he has done in BJJ. I do not enjoy him saying early on in his promotion that his technical innovations were better than everybody else in BJJ but he doesnt say that anymore. His technical ideas advanced the art but every person who develops a system does. . Why wouldnt I have top quality guys from Cicero Costha film for my website? They get paid and I get great videos. I am going to assume for a second that you are not referring to the top guys who have filmed like Paulo Joao and Hiago and geared more towards Little Miyao Jonas and Italo. Why do they need to be my students to film and contribute to my website? I have  or so people that have contributed..all from different teams. If you are upset about me using them to promoting my GYM rather than JiuJitu.net they do live with us free btw for  of the year staying at times for months. They are a big part of the academy both as training partners for the guys and on a social level. I DID NOT make them good but contributed as many have in small ways to their technical knowledge and in big ways enabling their success by helping them do what they do.  . I have brain damage. I cant roll much less compete. This probably frustrates me more than you. Last competition I did was that Five Grappling  Man Open Weight invitational at mid way through my brown belt in . I  submitted th Planets Jeff Willingham after  beat Checkmats Steven Martinez by  and lost to Atos HQs Mike Carbullido  for nd place. Before that was Pans where I won by no show defeated somebody I dont know the name of  from McVicker then lost to AJ Agazarm  .. I dont hide behind a burner account to make a comment. Since it has been suggested that I am not competent on the mat I will strongly consider a superfight between you and I. I would not be able to train for it and would be with the gi but think I will be able to have enough cardio for a single match. This requires A. you coming out from a burner account and B. getting my families support  because there are health consequences.. Thank you for calling me a great commentator and analyzer.

10740513,0,t3_5tjp6y,Well first the problem is you are in physical danger. Your thinking brain knows that your partner will stop when you tap but your less evolved parts dont know that. So thats panic induction. Next you are trying to do new moves which means you have to work harder mentally and physically to get your body in the right places. Then you have to know which moves to do and by the time you remember which thing youre supposed to do and how to do it its not the right thing anymore. So you wasted all that time and effort and are no better off than before. To get better at this do it a lot. Also have a plan. Start with I want to be on top of or at least not underneath this other person and make that your whole thing.

10913076,0,t3_5vvar1,I agree with OP but I feel the word that is missing from this type of debate far too often is leverage. You use technique to increase your natural attributes in strength and flexibility you leverage your strengths with technique. A great example of this is a sleeve grip break if someone grabs your sleeve tight youre going to struggle to get them off. A Ygrip break greatly increases the amount of force you can apply while making your opponents grip weaker. Using a second hand on it increases this mismatch even more. However a five year old no matter how good their technique is not going to break a heavyweight adults sleeve grip.You also leverage your knowledge of fundamental concepts knowing that pinning a hip or head weakens the bridge or shrimp or flattening someone out nullifies their half guard. You still have to have a decent level of attributes to pull that off or better still know where your attribute mismatches are and direct your opponent away from their strengths and towards yours.,bjj,de5lu6p,0,t5_2qn02
10915252,0,t1_de5jm14,I think it comes down to addressing diminishing returns or the spider chart area concept which basically amounts to mathematical proof of the value of attribute balanceyou dont need to necessarily be an elite outlier in any one attribute but its also very important not to be like a  sigma outlier in anything either lest it drag down your total effectiveness and safety. Whether the attribute is strength mobility or endurancewhatever effort brings you from  sigma to  or  is worth more even mathematically as above in calculated radarspider area than getting from  to  or  because being a negative outlier in any one trait is disproportionately detrimental to mean performance level.Being able to pancake in half or to play inverted guard for  years without risk of lumbar damage is probably a  semielite mobility skill. I would estimate that only about  of people especially men I have met or seen on BJJ mats can put the bottoms of their feet on the floor behind their head which is pretty much the gold standard for elite and complete hip mobility. To some extent this is genetic based on hip anatomymany people may not even be able to ever stretch to the point where they can do this.The reason that plenty of other people still manage to avoid injury without that elite level of mobility is proprioceptive and nociceptive intelligence. The body subconsciously adapts over time to its ROMs and what it knows it can do and intuits and transmits danger warnings when it gets close to being subjected to something injurious. The faster an insult happens the less time there is to react to this neural feedback which is why more people are hurt during explosive play than slow play. Ideally every grappler would be a perfect mix of above average attributes but the reality of personality and preference is that people tend to acclimate to the practice of improving favorite attributes and thus they end up with attribute imbalances. One thing no serious player ever wants to do however is to end up left of  bottom  in any trait.Cliffs Math proves balance isnt bullshit. But lifters gonna lift stretchers gonna stretch.,bjj,de5txc4,1,t5_2qn02

10970650,0,t3_5wmwhu,. Try not putting too much strain on your joints. Eg. move hips more instead of trying to do stuff with your knees. . Err on the safe side when you think you couldve been injured. These days if my body makes any weird sound when sparring  some click some knock  I sit it out for a while cool off and doublecheck if Im okay. It may sound paranoid and obviously the majority of times its nothing but I learned it the hard way. You cant feel most injuries right away not fully at least and carrying on can make matters worse.. Every time you have an injury dont return to the mat until its resolved. Otherwise it will keep on coming back.. Once youve healed an injury returned and now are protective of it beware  now youre at greatest risk of injuring something else. Especially with limbs its a typical pattern you hurt one the opposite one follows because now you use it too much.. Train regularly. If youre switching gears too much the body is more prone to injuries. Most of my injuries happened after I took like a couple of weeks of break.. Theres never too much of good warmup and stretching. And often too little in the class. If youre early for the class dont waste time do a bit of that. Every little helps.. Dont try doing clever stuff in sparring  like grabbing two pant legs with one hand I screwed up my finger exactly that way and it was only a few months back so not being a beginner anymore I really shouldve known better. Its sometimes tempting but taking such shortcuts is when bad stuff often happens.. When in doubt tap. Its not a competition just tap.,bjj,debjmmi,1,t5_2qn02

The reason I ended up playing this way was I found it a lot easier for me to sweep and end up in top position which I prefer wrestling base.  I really feel like if someone is good at half guard sweeps there is nothing the other guy can do hell eventually get swept.  Because the nature of the position you have the ability to sweep under electric chair or under hook side dogfight or waiter sweep. The only subs Ill attempt are kimura  roll under to heel hook  or deep half to back control.  I recommend watching guys like Bernardo Faria Ryan Hall and Eddie Bravo. The lock down is really effective for me too in controlling larger stronger guys. But sometimes you realize you get too dependent on it. ,bjj,deqwboq,1,t5_2qn02

Or a lower belt within  inches of me who refuses to let me have my kimura grip so they move up really high on me on his own and puts me right there for the sweep.

11384399,0,t3_62gku9,Lol that story made me cringe. Poor Lil white belt.I remember when I first started probably had about  months experience at this point my professor told me to roll with a brand new white belt who we all knew was the ultimate spaz. Thrashing around constantly violent arm flailing grunting loud enough for the entire gym to hear every few seconds you get the idea. He was indeed that guy. So I get paired up with this kid put him in my closed guard and proceed to get slammed on my back over and over again from him trying to break my guard. It wasnt working so he switched to grinding his elbows into my thighs. Still wasnt working so he started slamming me again repeatedly. I blame myself for not controlling him as well as I should have but by the end my back was completely fucked. I was never in any danger but I was definitely injured at this point. My professor and I made eye contact a few times throughout this experience and I think he knew what I was thinking. He called me over and told me to sit this round out but to watch him closely. He called the other white belt over and proceeded to dominate the shit out of him. The kid was still grunting and Thrashing around and stuff but my professor was just laying there smothering him looking at me and talking me through what hes doing while not even breaking a sweat lol. I think my professor looked at the other guy maybe three times their entire roll. At one point the white belt stood up like he was about to go for a takedown so he immediately got hit with a solid hip toss and landed back on his ass. Round ended they shook hands I smiled at my professor he nodded at me and that was it. It was humbling just to even watch that happen. The dude kept showing up for a few weeks afterwards and was WAY more calm during his rolls... but I havent seen him since. Its been a loooooong time.,bjj,dfmehsi,19,t5_2qn02

This is a lousy place to be. A very explosive granby can get you to reguard. Its much lower percentage here though Sitouts are still possible if they dont have a harnesshooks yet If they come too high up on your body you can actually buck them off by lifting your hips and throwing them forward. Be careful you dont expose space for their hooks thoughTake a look at Eduardo Telles for a lot of amazing resources as well as any wrestling you can find. Wrestlers deal with turtle a lot so its a major area of study for them.gt Should I try to pass to the other side equally or is it okay to focus on the side that feels more natural?I have passes that I do to my strong side knee cut XPass etc and complementary passes I do to the other side. I personally find it more efficient to work passes on one side but build a system where failures for the first pass lead into answers for a second pass often changing the direction on my partner.Further youll find over time that techniques have a habit of marinating. Even if you suck at something at first and dont train it youll discover in a few years that youre much better at it anyway just from your general body movement improving over time and how things tend to abstract themselves as concepts later down the road. So I wouldnt sweat this point too much if youre a whiteearly blue belt.,bjj,dfvvo4s,6,t5_2qn02

11485890,0,t3_63xjjj,As soon as you realize hes going for this move hug your shin with your inside arm. Keep your arm between your leg and the mat. This will make it hard for him to finish the pass but youre still stuck.Try to engage your outside leg to form a barrier like knee shield or foot in the arm pit and push against him to relieve the pressure of his forearm against your face. Your inside leg should be hooking his upper thigh pushing him up and away from you to make space for the outside leg to get engaged with the help of your outside arm. Think about trying to get his weight off of his arm and ideally the leading leg.And then watch out for the long step pass which will be coming at you with a fury if you let him switch grips and move back to the middle.He may also redirect and try to take mount by turning his knee the other direction.

11630993,0,t1_dgecsrw,Even though youre not likely to be executing high amplitude throws at home rolling on some .mm mats over concrete will leave you feeling worse for wear IMO.  I light roll with my kids on a mm kids play mat which is anything but high density over floor boards and a light hip bump sweep can be felt pretty heavily from my admittedly tough  year old sometimes P You could get away with a higher density rubberfoam underlay and bring the total density gtmm IMO.  Check out Clark Rubber as well for larger rolls of this stuff at various densitiesthickness.  Horse stall matting as a base layer might even work as an underlayer and comes in .xm sizes usually.  The Zebra options are mm thick puzzle mats for mif this is your preferred option then just go with the Bunnings options IMO and maybe double it up or opt for an underlay as mentioned above to the mm option which is about m  this might be a suitable option as a single layer and probably cheaper.  Alternatively you could use their rollout mats or their grappling mats which are .xm or xm respectively for around .  In my opinion youll never regret buying a quality piece of gym equipment where quality like this counts.  If youre just deadlifting or working on your beach muscles any old iron will probably do.  If youre rolling around and dont want to get hurt waiting a couple more months and getting some nice mats will be well worth it. ,bjj,dgedw3x,3,t5_2qn02

As simple as that.I could show up to a few more classes a week I could be more concentrated during drilling and more goal oriented while rolling I could come up with more questions for my instructor I could be using this break at work to watch BJJ videos on youtube instead of talking to people on rBJJ.

The sport becomes entirely about your ranking once you do that and technique devolves into the best local minima for winning at a specific ELO instead of constantly improving. For example club champions at . in tennis may have horrible groundstrokes but they can chip the ball back  times and no one at . has a weapon to punish defensive play. If you have ELO in BJJ you will see the middle divisions develop their own shitty offshoot techniques that only work on people at that skill level.,bjj,dgorl0m,1,t5_2qn02

11775966,0,t3_680q9j,Theres been a weird influx of posts about douchey instructors lately. Where the hell do you guys find these people? Ive been to a tonne of different schools in the  years Ive been at this and not a single one has even become visibly upset and Ive never had anyone walk off a roll and ignore me.How does anyone even get good at jiu jitsu if they just walk off a roll when they get challenged?,bjj,dguubh6,3,t5_2qn02
11778751,0,t1_dgv4x9p,Came here to say this. Seemed like he was skeptical about the sport and simply wanted to assess whether he needed it or not. He tapped didnt throw punches and seemed to be impressed by the guy rather than blame him for cheating or something. ,bjj,dgv5qa8,87,t5_2qn02
11779198,0,t1_dguvns5,there is an adult blue at my school he is so fast and strong I just cant stop his torreondo pass. The masters purple seems to chain passes more fluidly ie use less energy. ,bjj,dgv7k0n,1,t5_2qn02

11783837,0,t3_6831ez,I agree with letting the gym ownermanager know. Your last convo should get the point across I hope! In the case that she is just super socially awkward if there are other women that regularly train you could also introduce her to them and suggest that they would make good partners  find someone to pawn her off on ,bjj,dgvqimq,2,t5_2qn02

11809546,0,t1_dgyn9yz,A. Its hard to keep my mouth shut. I am passionate about science. He talks shit about my heros Carl Sagan Michio Kaku Brian Greene Stephen Hawking Einstein... Etc.B. He is anti vaccine and has Bachelors in nursing. He has influence on kids and their parents.C. I am watching as people are slowly converting to this stupid ideology and it makes me sick.The hand sign is literally arm out in a  degree angle with the palm facing down and fingers extended... Like youre telling someone they must be this tall to ride.,bjj,dgyniqm,36,t5_2qn02
11809560,0,t1_dgylszm,Im not sure about other shady stuff but he is not nor ever was anywhere close to being a real brown belt. Him and I have relatively similar amount of time exposed to bjj training but he likes to lump it in with TKD wing Chun karate etc and say he has  yes of experience he does this in the vid. When we trained together three years or so ago Id say we were similar in skill but it feels as though he stopped training altogether around that time.  I have been training about every other day for six years now and it really wasnt hard to control him when he showed up for open mat despite this he claims he has more technical knowledge than me.I think he has convinced himself of his own rank and excuses his lack of training due to his busy schedule. This however is no excuse to claim a rank you dont deserve especially since there are plenty of skilled practicioners in the area.  He is stealing customers from respectable schools by using misleading marketing techniques. This is reprehensible and I have tried to steer him into the proper way countless times. I was the one who suggested he start training with Fabio and us at  in the first place.,bjj,dgynksl,10,t5_2qn02
