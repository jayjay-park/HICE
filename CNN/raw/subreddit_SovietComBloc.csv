4963047,0,t3_3iw4bv,I made this little album because as some of you know Im working on a RussianSoviet collection that spans from  technically .  It only concerns the onpaper official infantry rifles which means the collection would simply consist of the M M SKS AK TypeIII AKM AK and AKM.  Since Ive got an alright AKM representative already and an M I figured Id do a direct sidebyside.  I always found it interesting just how different their designs had become over the past  years.  Bonus  photo at the end to really show how quickly the changes were made.Like it says in the album my SGL  AK is standing in for the M here but I do have a proper M variant that I plan on properly converting into a sidefolder SGL .  Since the two rifles will be identical with the magazines removed I figured it wouldnt matter for the purposes of this album.,SovietComBloc,cuk4q4y,3,t5_314zg
