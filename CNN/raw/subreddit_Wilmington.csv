But you do have several beach options and downtown between th Street and the river is pretty. Plus youve got Airlie Gardens and other picturesque garden like places to visit. Wilmington is expected to grow quite a bit over the coming years and is already pretty expensive. You might find more affordable living in Leland right across the bridge a quick little trip. Wilmington is surrounded by water on  sides and a lot of expansion will happen in Lelands direction. Food is good I hear the nightlife is good I dont really participate in it. Theres areas around downtown you should avoid namely most of the teen streets th th etc the area around Greenfield Lake and the streets off of Market Street nearer to downtown. Ive lived here  years and like it fine. Its not as full of options as your larger city but if youre sociable Im sure you wont run out of things to keep you busy. ,Wilmington,cplb26s,1,t5_2r69k
