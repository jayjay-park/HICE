3368979,0,t3_2ymtzj,eBay Lichtbjd is a china place that has some. I usually just make my own though but I live right next to a thrift shop where kids jeans or leggings are like a buck and I can make five or so out of them,BJD,cpcaeqz,1,t5_2s889
3392462,0,t1_cpeydhk,Yeah! A lot of BFs dolls are like that. A bit.. childlike dreamy. I named mine Q. Shes my little darling. shameless bragging.Anyway. A lot of sites are like that. If you find a doll whoose face you like look around the site. Often you can choose MAKEUPNO MAKEUP and stuff right on the order page. And sometimes you have to look around for BODY PARTS and find the bodiesfaces there.,BJD,cpeyu4y,1,t5_2s889

3622227,0,t1_cq08qt3,Hujoo msd are very cute. They have an innovative joint sistem and cute faceups. Take a look on them. Many people dont consider them bjd due the plastic resin is more skinlike and easly faceupable but they pose so well and they are so cute that on flickr usually takes the bjd tags.,BJD,cq55sas,1,t5_2s889

6313588,1,t1_cz77ii9,I actually just did a full photoshoot with lots of different angles these  shoots were kind of limited due to my lighting but I just got a new setup that allows a lot more flexibility. So expect more versatile photos soon That said yes I do love Mirais boobsNot sure why you feel the need to be condescending,BJD,cz7a9nm,1,t5_2s889

6707134,0,t1_czxz6n9,I think right now theyre just dolls... I know theyre working on some that can walk and do emails and stuff like that but I wasnt able to find anything to indicate that they had already succeeded on a small scale. I could totally be wrong though.,BJD,d0d2pzj,1,t5_2s889
9180629,0,t3_561g0x,Congrats on maybe finding the one! Honestly youre not on a time limit or are you? lol so take your time and feel free to search through other companies.  If time has passed and you still find yourself going back to Crobidolls Lance then go for him!My first doll was a cm and to be honest any size is a great size to start.  Yes some people may prefer smaller sizes and then there are some people like me who prefer bigger sizes but how will you know unless you can see them in person or actually own one?  If you can try to see if there are any doll meets in your area its a great way to meet other doll owners ask questions and a great way to see dolls up close and personal and possibly handle one.,BJD,d8fpn5z,2,t5_2s889
9435944,0,t1_d9bjgko,I think practicing them and reworking is your best option for sure!  I think even getting the doll I want for him is going to be a while still. XD,BJD,d9c2lge,1,t5_2s889
