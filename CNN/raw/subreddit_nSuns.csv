10505116,0,t1_dcyuz3j,Yeah. I guess it wasnt so much my Chest but more of my shoulderneck area. The weight just felt painful when it was resting on me. I tried just pushing through the pain but once I got to the later sets I thought something was wrong and I didnt want to injure my self. ,nSuns,dcyv7bx,1,t5_3isih

10535745,0,t3_5qsvx0,Looks pretty reasonable to me. Seems like its inspired by the  for beginners bit. I would use a similar  progression for the overhead press since thats the only upper body lift for that day. ,nSuns,dd2ccz2,1,t5_3isih
10665143,0,t1_ddeppjb,Tips of Front Squats to help you out before yours.Spend some time with the empty bar getting your grip right. Dont try to hold the bar but let it rest over your delts and kinda use your middle three fingers to balance it. I used the elbow grip and not the cross grip. Stretch your wrists out a good bit because its not the most comfortable thing in the world.Felt super satisfying to finish though.,nSuns,ddg115r,2,t5_3isih

11653945,0,t1_dggy8xu,I would definitely say deload your  set to the weight that is your RM. I found OHP takes longer to stall if you start it where youre getting more than  on  set and killing AMRAP. ,nSuns,dggzmce,3,t5_3isih
11656187,0,t1_dgh6w2c,Nah best to just do the sets as theyre laid out and try for the number of reps in each set. Record any failures and move on. If it becomes a recurring thing then perhaps do a deload.,nSuns,dgh8rrb,5,t5_3isih

11725792,0,t1_dgot99b,When I started my s were a good deal less than my recently tested onerep maxes so I was originally busting them out for  reps. A fun game I would play is to use my previous  total plug it into a calculator lets say I did  for  which is a onerep max of  and calculate how many I should be able to do next week via calculator if I upped the weight to  I know I should be able to get at least . It kept me motivated early on especially knowing that I should be able to get up the weight multiple times.    After a while my s turned into s and some s every now and then. Ive read on this subreddit that some people dont up their TM  pounds after a  on the  but I always would since technically the spreadsheet said If you get  reps increase TM by  pounds. Im glad I did this because for five consecutive weeks my  bench went  for   for   for   for   for  and I was able to finally hit two plates before my first bench deload.,nSuns,dgp5dft,9,t5_3isih
11733679,1,t3_67fg7z,No. The incline Bench is an accessory to help increase your bench Press numbers. If you want to do Dumbbells for variants then do it after as an accessory. If you still want to do it in place of incline bench then ask yourself if this program is right for your goals.,nSuns,dgq1jbw,0,t5_3isih

11757312,0,t3_67rbmk,How long have you been doing this program?  OHP will be the first lift that  of people stall at. But  week is not a stall. Give it another week hitting all your reps for DAY  should give you the endurance you need to crank out  reps next week or the week after.Theres no reason to deload  lift unless youve missed it  weeks in a row and youre not making progress. Progress isnt just the  but the  at the end of your  day. Maybe you struggled at the  and  rep OHP on day last week but you hit them this week with ease.,nSuns,dgspz0k,1,t5_3isih
11783379,0,t3_684r2c,Deload mate.  IMO youre not completing a workout if you cant finish the sets after the .  Accessories are up to customization but the volume that follows is part of the core program.  If youre cutting there is details on how you can trim TT to suit the lack of energy.  Aside from deloading you can pause the set for secs to catch your breath and finish the last rep or two.  If youre pausing mid set for a typical resting period then thats more reason to consider a deload.,nSuns,dgvon7v,5,t5_3isih
