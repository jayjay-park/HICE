1361572,0,t1_cimya66,While in an ideal world that would be great not everyone will want to reserve an attack. Balloonion is very touchy with the type of base you can attack. Usually the two I take are two of the only bases of comparable strength that balloonion can hit. Again I want to win I dont want to have to fill out a chart to call an attack. I want to get on find the base I want and take it. Not get on well hey thats a base I could take but oh wait soandso called it. I want to win. I do. I really do. But this is WAY too serious. If the clan is any good at attacking then a chart is not necessary. Just kick the idiots who dont lure or dump a retard army on a base  spots above them. Clan wars are won inside the lines by being a  pr not by planning and charting off the court.,redditstrike,cimyo4l,1,t5_2yy75

2208535,0,t1_clkj336,Love it.Id also like to suggest that for lost cause wars where we each get a practice attack...we encourage people to think outside the box and try something new. Ill admit it whenever I see a mass dragon attack against a th I sigh...come on guys. That used to be solid for THs but now as a TH its time to step up the big leagues. The single best thing I did to improve in wars was to stop using mass dragons...once I got practice with GoWiPe for example Im now confident I can  star any TH and some THs. Thats a huge step up from someone who can only attack with  dragons and a handful of rages.Its a big jump to make though which is why I think itd be perfect for those wars which we deem imbalanced.,redditstrike,clkk4kp,3,t5_2yy75
