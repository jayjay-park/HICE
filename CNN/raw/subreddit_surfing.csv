155831,0,t3_1vtx4q,i lived in SEA for  years and just moved to SD  months ago.Winter in WA is rough the water is frigid and the coast can be quite rough with strong swells.  not a great time to learn.However you can score some more manageable and fun surf in the strait of juan de fuca.  You can get west of port angeles in  hours or less by taking the ferry.  I always took the EdmondsKingston ferry never crowded in the winter time.The thing about the strait is that its a damn gamble for whether or not youll score.  I look at the forecast for what i think will work before i go and ive had some shoulderhead clean days ive had some completely flat days and ive had some choppy blown out days. that variability makes it more of an adventure SD has tons of opportunities to learn year round.  totally different scene down here!,surfing,cew6ih8,1,t5_2qmde

I suppose I ought to revise my statement to be more clear  You dont see many boards with those dimensions that have three and only three fin slots.  haha!And I think the point still stands.  Out of those people who have five fins who COULD I guess ride it thrusterstyle very few will choose to do so.  As you noticed to much drag and once youre down around   is just too wide to really be able to be going rail to rail to get good speed out of a thruster.FYI  that board sounds freakin fun.

Try also staying in the top rd of the wave if you can.  Here was a good discussion that took place the other day on pumping The other thing is your bottom turn.  Are you maintaininggenerating speed? Probably just need some practice to really drive off the bottom so you start to fly down the line.  Keep at it man.

Like you I felt very intimidated and still do sometimes but its amazing how much difference it makes to get used to the placebreak. Paddle to the lineup even if you dont go for anything but get used to it. I personally do very very very early dawn patrol like am just so I can get the break to myself for a bit.

1413805,0,t1_citaovz,With the proper combination of swell tide wind and crowd it is a pretty good wave for shortboarding. For most average days the closest comparable Ive encountered while traveling is probably head high Sunzal longboarders included. The longboards make it hardannoying to navigate and catch waves unless youve spent some time sorting it out.With respect to the chaos  my guess is the longboard revolution gradually screwed up the lineuphierarchy that was there before. When I talk to people that used to surf there back in the day it sounds like it used to be pretty orderly and mostly shortboards. My theory is on most days now you have that sort of longboard crew out there but on big days everyone comes back out of the woodwork along with people that normally surf other spots which are maxed out and it gets chaotic. So it doesnt seem to be like other primo spots in SD where you have the same local crew that is there on both the average days and the good days and will regulate the crowd.,surfing,cithzt1,3,t5_2qmde

Thats why the shapers have sizing instructions e.g. XX inches shorter YY inches wider etc. than your standard board. But its not like increasing volume when going to a groveler is going to hurt.I think the current split for my boards is about .L . and . for the boards that have volume measurements on them but in a perfect world Id add a touch more to both.,surfing,clstvbj,3,t5_2qmde

2868098,0,t3_2sx8v9,As others have mentioned your board is big. But that doesnt mean with good technique you cant get that thing under waves. First on a big board paddling speed is a huge asset for getting out the back. Paddle as fast as you can at the wall of water then reach up and grab the board right up at the nose and pull yourself forward to submerge the very front of the board. The tail will stick up and the wave will hit it. As it passes over you try to control the board aiming it directly into the direction of the flow of water and let your body slide back down the board  laying as flat as possible to pierce through the water while you still hold on at the nose. On the surface adjust and sprint to the horizon again. The faster you get out the fewer waves you have to duckdive.,surfing,cnu3qth,3,t5_2qmde

Some of the emails TCA has received since the April  meeting mention concerns of the projects potential impacts on the San Onofre State Beach park leasehold within Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and coastal areas adjacent to I. The  Tesoro Extension is approximately . miles from the state park leasehold. It is not in the San Mateo Watershed.Read more  Follow us theinertia on Twitter | TheInertia on FacebookSo its actually not even IN the watershed and has zero impact on state park lands.

4015702,0,t1_crdg2he,Thats a grossly exaggerated explanation about surfing.  If youve actually done any surfing you would know how it actually is. To quickly sum it up based on my personal experience of course and at my local break I would say I catch anywhere from  waves. They can rage from  sec close outs poor choice of course or  second rides. Now you do the math and compare that with the time it takes you to get down the mountain on a single run. As a side note surfing takes work e.g. paddling out and positioning yourselfsometimes constantly. Complaining about waiting in line and taking a lift up the mountain isnt going to catch you any sympathy at least not from me. Also you want to talk about waiting I can surf for  hours and I just told you how much of that is actually spent surfing a wave. I think you get my point.This is why we respect each other in the lineup most of us at least and unfortunately this is why localism exists. ,surfing,cre0qvx,3,t5_2qmde

I am an individual that deals with injury often and what Ive learned is this  we heal.  If you follow the advice of your physical therapist once youre ready to see one I would assume youd be on the road to recovery.  The trick I find difficult is to not stop once you feel fine but to continue the strengthening exercises for a while afterwards.  Sorry to give you information that brought you pain but as I said earlier it seems like a good thing something was found and now begins the road to recovery even if that means surgery.

Cloud did turn on proper later in the week but at the time I was thinking Ill take the guaranteed epic big lefts. Also Manilla is probably the biggest shithole Ive ever been to besides Cambodia. For fucks sake get your country together no wonder Filipinos are all over Hawaii and the West coast. Krui area is packed with surfers though  of them cant surf and everyone is hitting the reef. Got some long ones at Ujong....intown Krui never really turned on maybe the swell was the wrong angle? but I was charging the right like a maniac and managed to score some jet engine barrels. Met some cool ppl. Another win for Indo no surprise there. Maybe next year Ill take my girl to Siargao  seems like theres a lot of smaller waves that are good for chicks.,surfing,cu6dlr1,1,t5_2qmde

Have a look at the animation here Tues and Wed. The way the lows skirt up but dont make landfall while the wind comes in SE is ideal. The deciding factor locally for most spots is the wind obviously. Anywhere there is moderate shelter form the SE wind will light up from tomorrow on. The west swell mid period and SE winds should see good surf from Kerry to Sligo for the next few days...hopefully. ,surfing,cuup85o,1,t5_2qmde

Along with the common chimpanzee the bonobo is the closest extant relative to humans. They are also widely considered to be the most intelligent ape apart from humans of course. Female Bonobos are socially sexually submissive and their societies live in peace as a result. Its a different case for both Chimpanzee and Human societies and we both live in a state of perpetual conflict.  While you consider this red pill woman to be espousing a hateful ideology that doesnt mean shes wrong. It just means that you think shes wrong. Unless youre some kind of authority on human social sexual behaviour and you may well be though I doubt it youre not really equipped with the necessary intellectual framework to be able to determine whats right or wrong in this instance. Just to be clear Im not promoting this red pill thing personally. Im merely pointing out some facts about the reality of nature which is much much bigger and more relevant than your personal opinions about whats right and whats wrong.

As for what to do during the incident the same thing you should do every time you wipeout. Stay calm. You have to learn to fight what your mind is telling you. Its hard but it gets easier. Push yourself but understand your limits. Most those guys you see me included at one time or another were sketched out by anything overhead. You get more comfortable the more time you spend in the water. For me when the surf is small I try to go spearfishing.

A solid  months of large swell offshore winds and spots that are very consistent.Last Sunday every local was in the water at the same spot all  of us.Any one from any where could have paddled out and not had a problem there is so much surf here.

7031958,0,t3_4bqqx8,This is the thread for me! Some good ideas above.  yrs old and  knee surgeries have left me with arthritis in my right knee which swells anytime I surf. Just got some Supartz injections which may lube it up but it only has a  success rate and is usually used on people who are  or .  Ive gone from surfing  to  times a day to not at all with the possibility of never surfing again...at least not without major repercussions. Its been really tough depressing angering jealous all the emotions. Married for  years so I started wondering if I should have a kid!!! Just something to fill the void but Ive realized theres not much that can replace the feeling of surfing. I dusted off the sponge and have been getting a few days here and there but  more months and Ill find out if the injections worked and if I can surf or not. Loving the ideas listed here. My only thoughts are enjoy it every day. Surfing is the best thing ever ,surfing,d1dfe0m,2,t5_2qmde
7052298,0,t1_d1eaz02,I catch any wave so long as Ive had a chance to compose myself. This point break was giving me no chance to do that.  OK so this is good feedback. I think Ive been unlucky with the point breaks Ive been choosing  theyve both just been really strong side currents. There was a guy in the carpark who said to me Yeah need a gun!. At the time I thought he was being silly because it was a bit overhead but really not too much bother. But now the suggestion of mini mal for more paddle speed makes sense  the guy was taking about paddle speed to maintain position rather than wave size which is what I associate with guns. I managed to catch a wave by paddling off the point and immediately catching a wave. But there was no chance to rest so it was like  full effort to get to position and then need to give that  again immediately with no rest for the take off. Heart rate at max for like mins... I was able to do it once but no more and it required perfect timing and perfect duck dives. ,surfing,d1fqiyq,2,t5_2qmde

7747519,0,t1_d3mf97c,So depends on where you ride and what you like. Long mellow waves you can get a huge square tail with a huge spoon nose and tap dance all the fuck over it. If you are somewhere that is more of a beach break that might be shorter and dumpier you might want to look at something with a pulled in nose a big more of a pig shape. I have a spoon and I really just couldnt mesh with it in dumpy waves at home there was too much nose that would get caught or would swing too slow when I needed to pivot or turn. My current log is a square tail as well but more piggy in its shape with a pulled in nose a bit. I can slam on the tail an whip it around when I need it but it nose rides like a freaking dream. Granted the guys I used to ride with some rode big spoons and others ride  set ups on high performance longboards and kill it as well. Its all about what you like. Ive been riding almost exclusively longboards for  years holy shit just figured that out and it look me forever to figure out what I liked the best. ,surfing,d3mu43m,1,t5_2qmde

7887414,0,t3_4nbvrx,I moved down in size pretty quick but thats not really recommended for everyone.  I would just browse craigslist at this point obsessively.  Pick something in fair shape that will last you a month or so until you are ready to downsize again or get a nicer board.  Dropping down to a  isnt that much of a downgrade in size maybe going for more of a  to  foot board would be ideal.  soft top boards are really slow in my experience but its okay.  You arent going to be able to generate a ton of speed on them unless you know what you are doing.  If you go and get a glass board it will be a bit quicker and more solid but if you get it at the same size its really not going to be quick enough to make any real difference other than just noticing it.  If you have only had one great day maybe hold off until you have had a few and you start feeling really limited by the board.  The next step really depends on what kind of surfing you want to do.  Plenty of people are perfectly happy with surfing longboards the easy smooth rides are a lot of fun.  Other people want to get down in size and start shredding the wave up.  You should think about what kinds of things you want to be doing on a surfboard and then start asking for recommendations.  Some people really have no interest in making a bunch of turns they just want to have long stylish rides on a long board.  Some people want to be in and out of the pocket more than paris hiltons credit card so they want to get to small boards quickly. Figure out what you like and dont like then go from there.  And be lucky you have surf.  Its flat for me right now.  ,surfing,d42m9p9,7,t5_2qmde

8512570,0,t1_d62pl09,Honestly the outline of the Carver deck is almost completely irrelevant. Air resistance is just nowhere near as strong as hydraulic resistance. The most important things to think of are  the length of the deckwheelbase  how far away the front truck is from the nose  the rocker.With a normal skateboard you generally put your front foot right in the middle of the board on essentially the sweet spot for a skateboard with your foot pointed forward. This is because youre not gonna be able to turn much anyway and the skater will shift his front foot slightly before making a carve which will require LOTS of speed in the first place. The normal skateboard foot placement is meant to maximise forward drive from a kick since that is the engine for accelerating on a normal skateboard.With a Carver you dont ever kick after the first time because you can pump so you want to put your feet on the deck a lot more like a surfboard or a longboard if youre already going down a bomb. The front foot should go right behind the front truck at a  degree or more angle placement across the board and your stance should be as wide as possible with the back foot right on the back rocker and right on or behind the back truck.So going back to the  things I mentioned  the longer the board the wider your stance can be and the more you can apply the torque of your body into your carves even if the arc of the turn will be wider simply because the wheels are further apart think basically of how a longboard would act in the water or even just how a gun like your CI Tangent... so so jelly you live in the Galapagos would work on a bigger wave vs. a normal shortboard or a fish on a smaller wave way way more drive but less ability to make critical turns. It means you get the max speed from your pump and lots of control so you can effortlessly glide and cruise along the sidewalks. Heres how that would lookEDIT The Platypus is on a CV truck which was a prototype that lead up to the CCX Ive changed the video to the Cs on a Tyler Riddler. See how he can Carve UP a hill?!A shorter Carver is lighter and can go rail to rail more quickly so it takes more work but has better accelerationThese are on CX trucks which has more impact than length.then  how far away the truck is from the nose if you dare you can shuffle your foot further up past the front truck in order to make more critical turns and juice the torque out of your bodys rotation into the board. But obviously if you go too far forward you shift too much weight past the front fulcrum and WHAM face first into the pavement you go. You have to compensate by shifting your back foot further back. Leave too much weight on the back of the board especially with a deep tail high rocker and close wheelbase and then WHAM youre on your ass.Now the thing is most Carver boards already have the truck right up just behind the nose so in most cases the regular foot placement on these boards is already the most critical turn making foot placement you cant really put much weight past the nose because theres just no skateboard there to support your weight and because of the reduced nose weight you get less front swing which means way way more turn control. These boards are usually really short anyway and so you couldnt safely balance yourself by shuffling your back foot further back. These are the SURFSKATE series which are designed to most emulate surfing since like a surfboard if you put your weight any further forward than the sweet spot you will pearl straight into the reefOn the other hand even on a deck with more room in front of and behind the trucks the criticality of your turn will still largely depend on your foot placement relative to the truck. Basically with more deck in front of and behind your trucks you can cheat a bit and do far more critical turns on land than you ever could reasonably on a surfboard but of course simply just at greater risk as explained above. Furthermore the ability to do core skate tricks like Ollies and Manuals or Vert Lip tricks lies in how much board there is sticking past your trucks and of course the rocker which Ill get to at . Essentially with more deck you have something that is more of a CarverNormal Skateboard hybrid that works as an all around land vehicle. These boards are under Carvers Pool amp Park Category or TRANSITION seriesThis is what I have. I have the  Fraktal with C trucks. Its perfect for widening your stance in order to get more drive and turn or just putting my front foot in the normal Carver position and my back foot far far back on the high rocker in order to get the best surfy feeling and just gliding through empty streets. Its probably got the nd most extreme rocker of all of their boards beaten only by the Surfpunk.Which brings me to  the rocker. High rocker gives you way more torque and drive since the deck takes in more of your bodys rotational energy against the griptape and is also useful for skate tricks. Almost every single Carver model has a high back rocker and a deep kick tail so this isnt really a huge deal in the end. But of course the more rocker the more drive youre going to get which may or may not be a good thing as of course like always more speed  less control. So if you want to surge around like a maniac get the  Booster deck. If you want to have smoother more controlled flowier lines get a lighter rocker like the  Eggbeater.When it comes down to it though just get the one that looks coolest. There really isnt THAT much difference between the decks outside of length and truck placement but that will be why you might want to stick to Carvers decks because the wheelbase will be optimally placed relative to the length of the deck. Putting Carver trucks on a traditional skateboard deck will give you something that is basically a lot like a TransitionPoolPark.Heres my personal experience Ive ridden my friends . Flying Manta and my own  Fraktal. Heres the difference between them her Flying Manta felt a low more flowy although that might because she had just bought it and so the front truck bolt was still pretty tight and a lot more tight and controlled but with less ability to make critical turns. You cant really change modes on her Manta however by putting your feet in different places because there just isnt that much space to shift your feet around but I think these short nose boards make the most sense for shortboard practice for sure. You dont want to develop bad habits if youre largely using the Carver to practice specific surf moves. My Fraktal feels very skatey or surfy depending on where I put my feet as I described and works to feel more like the surfboards I surf which as a kook is limited to  to  Minimals I just recently got a barely used  Firewire Submoon if you want a comparison of the kind of surfboard Im trying to emulate with my  Fraktal.Here are the training videos that describe how to translate your Carver experience into the surf feat. the Flying MantaGiven that the experience you most want to emulate is surfing your  CI Tangent Id say you want a  overall long board for the drive to emulate the good surf conditions  a shortboard type Carver experience which would mean a truck thats very close to the nose which basically means looking at something in the Surfskate series probably one with a fuller tail so you can exploit more tail kick and  a tame back rocker because after YouTubing it the Channel Island Tangent has a relatively low back rocker so overall a very controlled surfy board thats got a lot of drive.Id say the . Tyler Riddler or the . Point Break would be pretty good if you have the room for a larger board. Those two also have pretty badass designs. You can really breeze from class to class on one of those. The Tyler Riddler for a more cruisery board the Point Break with a fuller nose for something more flexible.For something slightly shorter and more flexible get a full nose . Stacked . USA Resin or . Fort Knox.If you want a more compact board Id go for no shorter than  if you want it to feel like your Tangent. If youve got a shorter hybrid you use in your quiver that youd like to emulate then go shorter than . Like another poster said change between CX and C trucks to switch up between a FishQuad experience vs. a ThrusterSingle Fin experience.Id say if you want a  board go for the Proteus CI Pod Mod CI Flyer they go with your CI board or the one you posted the . Firefly. Personally speaking though that feels like to me the most boring design out of all of their decks. I guess there is a simple minimalist appeal to it though. The CI models are brand new and have matching surfboards that go with them and the same goes for the Proteus which is a little bit older. I think all of these collab decks are limited edition so get them while you can!! I guess if you dont have the exact matching surfboard however that might be why you want to nab the Firefly.But overall? The board Id recommend is the  ResinThey say it right there in the description The narrow nose template and wide tail is just like your favorite squashtail wave killer. Sounds like your Tangent all right! Of course if you dont like the design then dont get it. In the end were talking about extremely subtle differences here.,surfing,d65mne5,3,t5_2qmde

Mind you we do surf in Michigan but its very seasonal for us. The best time for us to ride Lake Michigan is during spring and winter. Summer every now and then and as long as the winds are at least  mph. Yes I have experience as a Great Lakes surfer. No I havent had much experience in the ocean. Although I can honestly say I remember the swell being much smoother in the pacific. Thank you for the tips on the Sharks. Ive heard that juvenile great whites tend to come close to shore once in a while. When I was I Maui I saw a Tiger shark from a distance with my instructor. It was a rush and it was pretty cool.Thank you for the tip on going to Malibu for longboarding. I will keep that in consideration. Ive never ridden a short board before. I know that you dont have to paddle as much when it comes to catching a wave compared to a longboard but I hear its harder to balance. Should I just go up to Malibu and longboard there or should I attempt to learn how to shortboard? Im only going to have one day to go surf.,surfing,d6kk40l,1,t5_2qmde

Until you know what is actually wrong with the board dont bother with that one.Honestly I would not be buying any board off Ebay. The board could show up in worse condition than it was sent. And since its a private seller you will probably have no recourse for a refund or compensation for damage. Surfboards can take an absolute beating during shipping. Think of the conditions that boxes show up in when you receive them. Now place a fragile surfboard into that position.Check Craigslist  Backpage for used boards. You want to look in your area because having a board shipped to you is a real roll of the dice.,surfing,d8dqqn3,3,t5_2qmde

9632803,0,t1_d9zso4f,My usual pop up tip is move your hands further down towards you hips. Like bottom ribbelly button level. You will find this lifts your hips up high.It could also be timing  as XXaudionautXX says you need to get the foot from prone to planted. You need to turn flex as said the foot at the right time and bend the knee at the right time.If you practice at home you will notice if your foot is hitting the floor or scraping along the floor. So dont do that...The pop up is pretty much muscle memory. Once you have it that is what you do and you wont forget how to do it  but if your muscle memory is doing it wrong then you will do it wrong until you retrain,surfing,da0fvxn,1,t5_2qmde

10709150,0,t3_5t581g,Im on the right coast so not an option but wanted to stop in and say dont get discouraged. That applies to the steep learning curve but also to the guys you surf with. Surfers can be very territorial so dont take anything said in the water personally. The same guy who heckles you in the water could be the most friendly dude on the beach and the same guys you chat with over a long session may not ever acknowledge you in the grocery store. Further making surfing friends who are not also regular friends all depends on the culture of the spot the quality of the wave and the make up of the crowd. For example the dawn patrol at the primo spot in my area are all good natured longborders of maturing age. Theyre friendly with me because they know my dad and because Im a regular. Now the late morning crowd is a completely different crew of younger and frankly more obnoxious guys whom I try to avoid. So try a few spots different times of say and under different conditions until you find what youre looking for. Good luck and have some fun. ,surfing,ddkkh7n,11,t5_2qmde
