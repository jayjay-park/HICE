7313040,0,t3_4fj1d4,That would probably be ideal but the purpose of a Civil War event would be to profit from the hype of the movie so I think theres no doubt that there will be some premium aspect be it event generator limited time character Zemo again? new premium costume or new permanent premium character. So it makes the most sense for it to be a event although probably more like the Pepper and gamma events than the GotG event.,avengersacademyios,d29fyaz,3,t5_3e8qf

7343898,0,t1_d2cxtv0,Hasnt she lost her shapeshifting powers? I think I read something about her accelerated healing factor inhibiting her shapeshifting. It was rather complicated something about shapeshifting changing cells and the healing factor restoring them to the original state and making them harder to change next time so her two powers worked kind of against each other.

7380635,0,t3_4gdew6,Unfortunately I was one of the those people that was hit with an bug that made it nearly unplayable.  My game would keep crashing as soon as it would start that paired with the fact that for three days I couldnt find a solution really demoralized me and I lost a lot of progress.  I actually ended up deleting the game today because I wasnt having fun anymore.    That being said this event did have some great features that I hope Tinyco will continue to use going forward for those who still play.  The separate mission board was a big plus I felt like I could focus on the event and building up my academy at the same time.  I dont generally have a problem with PP features afterall the company needs to make money somehow but if you got behind at all in the event it just seemed like the only way to catch up was to spend money and I dont really approve of that.  Overall it was a good event but yeah bugs killed the game for me.,avengersacademyios,d2h4lwt,2,t5_3e8qf
