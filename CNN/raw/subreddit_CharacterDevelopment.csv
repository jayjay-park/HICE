599992,0,t3_20v5gq,It begins with a name. A name randomly pops in my head and settles in my mind for a bit. I sit there and ask myself about that person where do they live? What are they like? Soon a face pops into my mind and I begin describing what they look like.Soon I have a couple paragraphs about them and they are ready to be inserted into my world or into a world of their own.,CharacterDevelopment,cg8h0tw,1,t5_2ytn2

1944441,0,t3_2gw9bp,Im not sure I get the story. What is the climax? Does the attackmutation happen early in the book and if so what will the rest of the book be about?,CharacterDevelopment,ckni8q8,1,t5_2ytn2

4438019,0,t3_3bvm57,Agree with Psyladine.One way to execute that is to  make sure that the secondary character dies with unfinished business of some sort something left to do that now needs to be done by someone else. That is the character cant die the moment she becomes unneeded to the story.,CharacterDevelopment,csq3igv,3,t5_2ytn2
8351912,0,t3_4turke,What makes a villain frightening? Wealthy villains are scary because they have influence. An impverished villain can still be scary because they might be Untouchable. Someone with power protects them Amoral. They dont recognize or care about the distinction between right and wrong Cunning. They are clever and can weasel their way into and out of situations with ease. Relentless. Nothing seems to phase them or stop them. Petty. They hold grudges and act spitefully at every opportunity.,CharacterDevelopment,d5ljiy4,3,t5_2ytn2

10201377,0,t3_5m2k1b,Personally I like your idea of leaving her vague. It makes it easier for a reader to get absorbed in the story if they can subconsciously put themself in her shoes. Maybe instead of giving a direct physical description you could describe something about her that more indicates her personality like the way she walks or the tone of her voice,CharacterDevelopment,dc0dssb,4,t5_2ytn2

11105326,0,t1_deqrpkj,Ive been kinda mixing the two.  Mostly its the dry encyclopedic stuff to help me get a handle on how I want my magic system to work but there are occasional offtopic notes from Mitexi fitting the way Ive written their personality frustrations and work ethic.But yeah its mostly for myself.So far while its been mostly devoid of political opinions by the character the characters problems with the powersthatbe in the world have come up.  The findings are inuniverse Mitexis way of organizing things and summing up the basics for explanations to the idiots that Mitexi has to deal with let them just read this.Mitexi generally likes very few people but does mention the two people Mitexi respects the one person Mitexi finds particularly useful and the one person Mitexi considers a friend and comments about them one of whom is a major character in the story Im working on tend to pop up.  Such as Danielle killed my recent experiment.  Spoiled brute no respect for my work.Mitexi is working under a dictator and as an antagonist is somewhat of a Mengele character.I really appreciate you putting so much effort into your response Human.  Thanks.,CharacterDevelopment,deqs28e,1,t5_2ytn2
11482950,0,t1_dfunehk,Lukas long term goal is to be a world famous inventor and wants to make a difference in the world in some way of course. Her impact on society is the fact that shes a well known prodigy already and is fighting for AIs rights since theyre oppressed so heavily. This isnt the only part of the conflict however. I could elaborate but this is for the character not the plot Thanks by the way! If you need to know anything else just ask yo,CharacterDevelopment,dfxl9eo,1,t5_2ytn2
11543657,0,t1_dg4ggtt,Fueled by her rage and need for revenge she might get carried away into thinking she can just cut Kody down but being on a stealth friendly terrain Kody would throw some sand into her eyes blinding her temporarily then moving in quickly for a deathly stab. He may or may not use his warps to move but he doesnt need them to suceed. Hed be grumpy about having to kill two instead of one but hed quickly get over it.He would then proceed to run or warp away depleting his energy pool of magic for the day and hide in a nearby city town or literally under the closest rock he can find. By now hed be a bit tired. I suggest sending a searching party after him that is unless they think theyve already lost enough people.,CharacterDevelopment,dg4h45v,0,t5_2ytn2
