That mall has a nice pool on the roof. Lazy days riding a bike playing cards amp saying hello to strangers.Do you not drink? Thatd be the big avoidable expense.,longtermtravel,czplxxz,1,t5_2yvl6

11072560,0,t3_5y1nww,Brazil Chile and Argentina are currently more expensive than traveling in Colombia Ecuador Peru and Bolivia so if youre looking to maximize the time the  lasts you might want to take that into account. You may also consider renting in one country like a local for a month to help it go further. As an example I am currently living in Baos Ecuador and there are two really nice hotels here night with plenty of cheap hostels at night and plenty of places in between. I pay month for a fully furnished very nice apartment with everything included water electricity internet full kitchen with everything I need. There are smaller miniapartments in my building that are month. So you can see K could go a long way with the right housing strategies rather than blowing it on some nice hotels.Best thing is I can still pay  for a day pass to the spas at those expensive resorts and still get that experience at a fraction of the cost. But you would never find these rentlikealocal places unless you found them in person in the larger cities and even medium size cities it can be easier to find those situations online but you can still likely do better by asking in person for a month discount and then asking for an additional discount for paying cash. Then you can use that place as a home base and explore other parts of the country on extended weekend trips and still come out cheaper than if you were staying in expensive or even moderately priced hotels.Also traveling via bus in South America will save you a ton of money vs frequent plane flights. Example round trip cost from Quito to the jungle Coca is . Round trip bus fare for same trip . Multiply that times  trips and it is  vs . Some serious savings in the case of my earlier realworld rent example a savings almost equivalent to a years worth of rent!.Colombia is even cheaper than Ecuador right now as well.,longtermtravel,den2bux,16,t5_2yvl6
