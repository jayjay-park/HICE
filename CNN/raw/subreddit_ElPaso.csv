9792519,0,t1_dak4csj,Only thing I can imagine is that the vast majority of land in Texas is privately owned. Whoever owns this land must have turned in a plat to the county and may have been planning a development at one time or another. Prior to development surveyors and soils engineers would need to get in to the areas and its likely that the owner hired a dozen or something to level out the roads. Later funding or interest waned and the project got mothballed but the plat still exists and therefor google overlays the map. I bet you would never notice it if your drove through there. I shoot at the abandoned quarries in the area and I have never noticed. Still cool though!,ElPaso,dak52do,3,t5_2rp61

El Paso has nothing to do with the downfall and the closures. The issue with K Mart is that they ran them terribly. They didnt keep up with the times. Same thing that is happening to Sears and the exact same thing that happened to Blockbuster. Are the El Paso blinders preventing us from seeing that big cities with larger economies such as Denver are closing down K Marts as well? Guess so...,ElPaso,dc5ba95,3,t5_2rp61

El Paso takes its Catholicism pretty serious. Any decent sized church isnt going to let you fly. My only other option was like  years of Sundays. Im not religious at all dude for me it was nearly worth it ending the relationship over it. Plus once its said and done all your friends want you to be god parents because finding married Catholic couples is like finding unicorns.  I say just go with the church you found. Its not worth the hassle. ,ElPaso,dcm8cxo,6,t5_2rp61
