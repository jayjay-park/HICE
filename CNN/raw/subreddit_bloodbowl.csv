355665,0,t3_1y5mdm,I think that using two similar teams is better so that the players can learn not only from what theyre doing but what the other person is doing as well. That way when one player figures out that a particular way of doing things is correct the other player learns that too or at least has some help learning that.Humans and Orcs have a lot of desirable traits such as the presence of both dodge and block but not in too great a quantity and generally similar strength but with a few outliers. Theres also juuust enough difference between the teams that the players can get a feel for utilizing their advantages while still playing basically the same game.,bloodbowl,cfhmqhb,1,t5_2r6pl

Opponents tend to underestimate the skill Nerves of Steel that comes on catchers meaning those long bomb passes are even more likely to be caught despite being marked.  Because the entire team like all elf teams has Ag  you can use any player for practically any ball handling.  Throwers and Catchers obviously are more likely to succeed in those whole pitch passes but dont be afraid to hand off to a lineman to cut the pass distance dramatically.  On offense use your superior speed and agility to put distance between the ball and your opponent.

5221551,0,t3_3mim1y,Blitzers and BlitzingBlitzers are better at blitzing because they are usually faster than your other players and have the block skill which makes them better at chasing and knocking down other players. The block skill negates a both down result for the piece that has it. This means that when you roll  block dice a player with the block skill only has a  chance of being knocked over compared to the  chance a player without block has They also have a  chance to knock down another player instead of a  chance because you can select the both down result knocking down the opponents piece but leaving your blitzer standing up.AgAG  means agility  which means that the player is better at dodging allowing them to get around the pitch more easily and better at handling the ball allowing them to capitalize on other teams mistakes. An agility  player picks the ball up in  tacklezones on a   chance where a agility  player would do so on a   chance Agility Dwarf is bad.  Agility Human is average.  Agility Elf is good.Armor ValueArmor Value is the stat that determines how hard it is to hurt a player. The higher the armor the less likely they are to be hurt. Whenever your player is knocked down d are rolled. If the sum of those two dice is higher than your players armor value after modification from skills like mighty blow or assists on a foul then you have to make an injury roll.  Armor Value Wood Elf is bad  Armor Value Human is average  Armor Dwarf is good,bloodbowl,cvfe08f,5,t5_2r6pl
5222190,0,t3_3mim1y,Strength is only used for blocking. If two players have the same strength roll one die. If one is stronger than the other roll two dice the stronger player gets to choose which die to use. If one player is more than twice as strong e.g. ST vs ST or ST vs ST roll three dice and let the strongest choose. Players next to opponents can give assists when blocking each assist gives  strength. Players standing next to opponents that arent involved in the block dont give assists.Agility is used for various skill rolls like dodging picking up the ball passing catch and more. In general you need to roll at least AG on a d to succeed so an AG player needs  or better. However many skill rolls have modifiers. Dodge for example has a  modifier and so does picking up the ball so an AG player only needs  or better to succeed in those. Passing gives a  to  modifier depending on the distance. The most commonly used skill rolls all have a  modifier. Before modifiers a  always succeeds and a  always fails but can still succeed on a  after modifiers if you have  agility.When a player falls down or gets stabbed you roll a d and if you roll higher than the armor value he gets injured. It doesnt change the injury just how often they get injured in the first place.Blitzer is just the name for a positional. On new teams they tend to be the only players with the Block skill which makes the blitz more likely to succeed and succeeding with the blitz is pretty important since you only get one per turn. They also tend to have higher movement than the rest of their team which gives them more option in what to blitz. Nonelf blitzers also get access to strength skills which can make them better at injuring opponents when blocking and blitzing is usually the only way you get to block the most important pieces on the opposing team. Theyre not neccessarily better for blitzing though. Dark elves for example will probably want to blitz more with their witch elves than their blitzers at least once they get the Block skill on them and every team will frequently find themselves in situations where its better to blitz with someone other than a blitzer.An AG blitzer is just a blitzer with  agility. Probably an elf.,bloodbowl,cvfgs3z,3,t5_2r6pl

As you get no benefit from it player cannot move again and you dont get SPP its sometimes seen as injuring for the sake of it. But then this is BB so some people are fine.In general fouling is a necessary part of the game and not at all unsportsmanlike. That tricky elf dodge into your cage but then roll a skull? Well foul him to stop it happening again. That key player you finally got down but didnt break armour? Well put the boot in whilst hes down. That guy on the line refusing to stand up so he cant be blocked into the crowd? Well make him regret your fist more than the fans.Teams with low cost players skaven linemen for example or in teams not yet released like zombies and goblins are great for fouling as even if they get sent off you dont lose much.

Bashy teams are just another style when youve got a finite league or tourney but in perpetual leagues they just have... so much of an advantage in the long term. It doesnt help that in the perpetual leagues theres not really any motivation to win games beyond just being proud of your leaderboard ranking. This hurts Agility teams because although many of them can go ahead and beat a Bashy team in TDs thus winning the game the Bashy team often comes out ahead in the long run just because they didnt have as many casualties and the loss really doesnt matter.

6703149,0,t3_47f2dm,I love your premise that is creating a mutations team with the purpose of encouraging people to really diversify what mutations they pick some of which are really fun and I think youve had a decent go at it. Essentially youre trying to bring out the agility side of mutations which are really fun but we dont see enough of.There are some issues I think you could work on the wizard some people have already mentioned. Your Tzaangors seem cheap to me k for both Horns Extra arms AND regular agility access seems ridiculous to me and I would consider reducing the number from  to  I think it might be better to allow  horrors rather than  tzaangors. You could probably treat the horrors as a tzaangorlite character that absorbs a skill from the tzaangor such as taking extra arms from them rather than prehensile tail which doesnt seem to really synergise with the statline or more mobile feel you have for the team. Im dont really like giving Warriors shadowing and tentacles. For a team youve tried to build around movement giving them an extra movement and taking away an armour then giving them skills which intentionally keeps them in tackle zones seems a bit silly. Also all strength  characters on other teams start with no base skills and I would be cautious about deviating from that youd risk making them complete freaks at high TV with great stats and a wealth of skills to go with it. Id say treat them like the rest of the team and let the coach build them how he wants. IMO coaches will be inclined to build them slightly differently to Chaos warriors due to their extra movement perhaps turning them into tanky catchers or ball carriers.Lord of Change seems fun though if his goal is to be a passer I would definitely consider a couple of things. Firstly give him six movement. I dont see any flavourful reason to make him slower than the rest of the team and if his job is to retrieve the ball give him the tools to do that. Secondly that ability access is ridiculous. With his statline it would be way too easy to feed him SPP through touchdowns and turn him into an unstoppable character especially with no negatrait besides loner even without general access on normals. I would definitely remove strength and agility access and perhaps remove some of his starting skills if hes not going to be given a negatrait some variation of bloodlust might be appropriate in this case. An interesting idea youll have to tinker with.Overall I like the idea and think with a bit of work you could make a really interesting team that fills a nice niche!,bloodbowl,d0cnwdi,2,t5_2r6pl

People can still buy inducements to help their cause a certain team may still buy a wizard because they believe the  TV boost of a wizards helps them win but at least their opponent can spend the TV as well Assuming even team values to start and maybe they grab a bribe and a babe.  So the match is still blood bowl balanced more strategy is required and the result is more closely tied to the play on the pitch instead of one team inflating themselves.

High strength ball hawk.With break tackle str can dodge into a tight cage on a  and most likely get a pretty easy  dice. Its a little situational since he has to start free or make the first dodge without using break tackle I guess but its a cool play to have available. This break tackle play would get better with also having dodge. So if you like this idea you could get dodge with the intention of taking break tackle later. Or you could just take break tackle now seeing as the wait for the next level will be long..

They are just the people who shout loudest and it worked! Look at Brets getting into BB. Same with the people GW might think to approach from tabletop  several exmembers of the BBRC are completely out of touch. With one or two exceptions these guys never played high level BB and dont have the depth of understanding to make high level recommendations. There are a number of people I would trust with helping GW develop the game if they ever needed it and most of these people would not be asked because they are not loud on the internet.,bloodbowl,d9zp01s,6,t5_2r6pl

9873534,0,t1_dauir1h,Do the rules mention perceived size or perception whatsoever? Im not seeing that anywhere hereI like how you left out the operative part of the rule that the ruler be placer OVER the models. If that is done with the new ruler and the new pitch in a straight line then the th square is shifted from long to short by virtue of the th difference in perceived size. This is  in line with the part of the rule you did quote. The rules say to look down from over the template not from the side and not with the template over the board. It doesnt use the language perceived but it does use the word look which is to perceive visually. If the steps are followed per the rules as written then the th square is clearly short. A by your logic I could choose to hold the ruler several feet above the board stick my eyeball right up to the ruler and get a quick pass from any square on the pitch to any other square.Again as with GWs other work the template is placer over the models head. Yes a several feet is technically over but that would be asinine just as much as placing it flush would be. There is a reason that holding it an inch or three about the board yields the same results.B You mean the ruler in the book that isnt to scale with the pitch consistently in the composite shops in the book? In none of the three pictures in the book I have from the new box is the ruler to proper scale either laying on the board or held over the models. Sorry.,bloodbowl,daujmho,0,t5_2r6pl

9894714,0,t3_5h3rdg,If you want some ideas i have recently build my own nurgle team from scratch using GW models. ImgurHere is my old reddit post about how i went about deciding what to use and mode small updates on the way RedditIn terms of what you would get for the team note that there are restrictions on the amount of models per model type that you can have in your team at any one time.For the Nurgle team these restrictions are  Rotspawn beast of nurgle  Bloaters nurgle warriors  Pestigors beastmen and  Rotters. So while you can model more than  for the bloaters  pestigors you can only field the maximum in a team at once. For this reason the nurgle team would would most likely be a mix of bloaters  pestigors and rotters small chance of getting the beast of nurgle in the box but i doubt it.For modelling the only real requirement is that you are able to identify the different types of roles in your team. Having different models entirely helps out as in my case using  different types of models for the  different types of roles,bloodbowl,daxazcs,4,t5_2r6pl
9897414,0,t1_daxnibq,Sure. I think they will. This time GW seems to be more interested in doing expansions. We already have Death zone season  and a snowy pitch.

11159708,0,t1_dewu1gd,gt Think of it more like you have an extra unit option on your team and while Rotters are your main line you also have this other choice to go with if you want.That would be thinking wrong then. Rotters are objectively worse than Beastmen. Its not a unit option you would never play with rotters if you were given the option to field unlimited beastmen.gtMoney is the easiest obstacle to overcome in team management  unlike SPP which Choas absolutely positively must get to become even slightly competitive you get money even when you lose.Its not just money that Im talking about. When people mention costs its also referring to TV. You seem to have some weird fixation on money I agree completely that its a nonissue. TV is a huge issue though. Its one of the primary ways you compare two teams as similar as nurgle and chaos.gtk for  skills compared against Choas whopping zero skills and a slight nerf to two stats that a team tough guy doesnt need anyway doesnt sound half bad at all.Youre vastly underestimating how powerful agility is. Sure you can word it like that and it sounds good. Or we could say its k for  garbage skillsregeneration isnt a real skill in this context at the cost of two incredibly useful stats. A team tough guy might not need agility and movement but chaos warriors are so much more than that.gtNurgle is about strategic placement not moving around a lot  those stats are exactly what they need to do that. Those stats are bad for ball handlers Nurgle Warriors aint ball handlers.NWs arent ball handlers. Youre absolutely right. And they never will be. Because of their stat losses theyre forced into a specific role forming a cage and eventually cpombing people. Because Chaos Warriors have a much better stat line theyre infinitely more versatile. They can dodge they can blitz they can catch the ball. Theres only one thing theyre not better at and never will be getting hit. Any decent coach will tell you that specializing in getting hit isnt likely to win you any games.gtA CW who even wants to consider taking those skills needs to injure a halfdozen guys to do itFeeding chaos warriors touchdowns is a staple of lowtv chaos play. You dont have to injure anyone. That extra point of agility and movement makes CWs fine ball carriers and its easy to hand the ball off to them for a score as well. Nurgle Warriors dont have this option and as a result skill up much slower and the team gets to competitive status much slower.gtNurgle is exactly that  youre a Choas team thats just buying a bunch of skills. Any strategy guide that talks about Chaos says this teams biggest drawback is that they start with no skills... Nurgle is a Chaos team that literally starts with skills.Yes Chaoss biggest drawback is that they have no skills. Do you know what Nurgles biggest drawback is? They start with no skills garbage stats not enough rerolls a roster that isnt full and they rely on a big guy.Nurgle is a good deal weaker than Chaos to start off and they never actually surpass Chaos because stats are so important at high TV.,bloodbowl,dewxvr5,2,t5_2r6pl

11241626,0,t1_df62lch,Not at all.  Like I said elsewhere when your TV is down in my league you make a lot more gold per game since we use the old deathzone league rules.  So while the squishy teams might get hurt more easily they also have the lower TV so they have the majority of the gold whether they win or lose.  As such the vast majority of bounties are put on the high TV teams the bashy teams.  Most of the bounties end up having the bashy teams crunching the bashy teams.On top of that we have the auction I also mentioned so a lot of people want to save gold as well.I guess if we only have the bounties without the auction you may be right but with the auction I think it offsets really well.,bloodbowl,df67zvp,1,t5_2r6pl

This makes it very easy to knock down amazons who all start with dodge Tackle negates the dodge skill both in blocking and during movement As an Amazon your advantage in bashing comes from being hard to knock down as normal undeveloped players can only knock you down with a pow or take a turnover through both down.

11650185,0,t3_665o5c,I think in some senses Id chose based on the environment tournaments how long the league is etc. Personally halflings and goblins are as good as they get straight away really skills dont do a huge amount. But in a league with a few seasons you can actually build up quite a team of ogre. You can try all  teams in Blood Bowl Chaos Edition ,bloodbowl,dggk9ed,1,t5_2r6pl
11661826,1,t3_66d7s0,Im actually ironing out the basics of a new league right now and Ive made two changes to core rules for it.Firstly Block is now an Extraordinary skill so your player can have it on his base positional but can never acquire it through normal means. This stops Block from being a snap pick on every first or doubles roll and makes blitzers more of a tactical threat rather than just a tougher lineman. This is also balanced in league terms since you wont have access to Norse Dwarf or Chaos Dwarf rosters for reasons Im not going to spoil.Secondly Ive done away with the awful TV system and simply made inducements based on the number of games youve lost so far. This works decently well since youll get the chance to boost your team in the offseason.Both of these changes should add up to a game with more emphasis on lesser valued skills without doing away with typical team advancement strategy entirely. ,bloodbowl,dghvsk7,-1,t5_2r6pl
