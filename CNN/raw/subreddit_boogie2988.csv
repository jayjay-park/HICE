40803,0,t3_1uj24r,Im a subscriber for a long time and I watch every video Boogie uploads but I think these kind of videos really make him look weak minded and whiny...He doesnt have any motivation and willpower you cant lose weight without this Im pretty sure hell never lose his weight.Its probably even harder for him to stop over eating because of his Youtube career he can stay on his computer all day and earn money. The fact that he cant exercice and walk for more than  minutes makes it worse hed have to eat lettuce all day for months to lose some weight... Its sad for him but hes in this situation because of choices he made when he was younger.I know Ill get downvoted Im on Boogies subreddit but its my opinion.,boogie2988,cej2rav,0,t5_2wbzn

495513,0,t1_cfwl5ou,I think ignoring the stupidity of little kids on YouTube who insult you and talk shit about you will help you if you surround yourself with positive people like this Subreddit then you will be more happy as well. I just wanted to tell you that you are one of the most inspiring and amazing persons I know certainly the most inspiring and amazing YouTuber youve helped me and many others through bad times we can all learn from you the mistakes we all made and your inspirational and emotional videos thats what counts because in the end people wont remember you because of little kids who liked to spam your comments with infantile stupidity they will remember your videos and how you helped and inspired other people Im sure there are people out there who literally owe their lives to you because they looked at your videos and got motivation and advice from them thats what matters I know its very hard to focus on the good side of things it always is but if you sit down and think logically and objectively about things its pretty obvious that those haters shouldnt bother you. But as I said in the end youll be remembered as a person who let others learn from his mistakes and who saved lives. Please keep up what youre doing and dont focus on negativity too much. Thank you for everything Boogie.,boogie2988,cfwldqj,4,t5_2wbzn

1656858,0,t3_2dbcmz,Its odd because I have had depression for awhile now and anxiety goes perfect with it  if by perfect I mean it creates a toxic cocktail. However for as much depression  anxiety I have there is the smallest tiniest most microscopic sliver of hope that burns brighter than all of the darkest parts of my mind. Sometimes the darkness tries to consume it and turn it against me but it always stays shining and after a few days I can go back to feeling like my normal I hate myself self instead of suicide does not sound so bad right now. What is my hope? Hard to say really. Maybe that I will find a way to cope with this beast or perhaps find a solution. Maybe its to find a guy who loves me and can deal with my mood swings depression anxiety. Maybe because I want to have the greatest sex of my life before I die. It could be the fear of death that I have the unknown of what comes next.Whatever that little sliver is I am glad its kept me going this far. I hope it continues to burn for many years to come.,boogie2988,cjo0dk9,3,t5_2wbzn

4078926,1,t1_crl76gn,I agree with your comment . Its sad that this has to be stated but you simply have the common sense that people on both sides of this discussion lack. Of course if you are severely overweight it is bad for you. You are likely to die earlier because of it. You are likely to become very sick because of it. Most people will not find you as attractive as they would if you were a normal weight. That is just a reality and noone can expect to be told that they are healthy when they are not or not to be debated on it if they do state so themselves. Also no one can expect that people will find you attractive  naturally this goes for everyone. Because of this to me HAES and fat acceptance are ridiculous movements spearheaded by delusional people who do not want to face reality. At the same time there is no reason to hate on anyone because of their weight. You dont know that persons story maybe they are overweight because they have a condition either physical or mental that keeps them from practicing a lifestyle that would be healthier for them. Maybe they just dont have the right information and want to be educated  but nobody is going to listen if they are being called hambeast in the process. Fatpeoplehate and its shitlords are for that reason equally ridiculous to me.Also I think it is important to state that not everybody who is skinny lives a healthy lifestyle. I myself am  according to my BMI  very close to being underweight yet I do not nearly get as much exercise as I should. I dont eat healthy foods as much as I should and I drink a lot of sodas. On the other side there are bodybuilders and fitness freaks that pump their bodies full of supplements that are potentially harmful whilst pushing their body to the limits in the gym risking sometimes serious long term injuries.I think that if everybody was just to focus on themselves for a little while and improve what they can the world would be a much better place. But it is much easier to point out the flaws in others that it is to face your own.EDIT Grammar,boogie2988,crl81fl,0,t5_2wbzn

But they have changed the amount of stomach they remove at least they have over here in the UK. My grandmother had the surgery a year ago and is still eating as much as she was before it. Sure shes lost some weight but shes still about  pounds. She was roughly  when she underwent the surgery.My point is there are success stories there are failures and there are tragedies attached to this surgery.

We all want boogie to be alive and healthy but whenever someone on this reddit talks about this stuff its downvoted into oblivion because everyone wants to keep the positivity up. The problem is as you pointed out this method is NOT working currently.When he said on Twitch he got into a screaming match with his wife begging her to bring him trashgarbage foods that made me think that while he is happier nothing has changed with his weight and mentality. I really believed him in his The truth about why I am so fat video. I still think he is trying to beat this but I think his version of trying and other peoples versions would be very different.I agree with you though. He needs to get off the internet and away from all the people baring his wife and check into a place where he can be CONSTANTLY monitored I fear its his only chance at this point and he needs to act very very quickly.,boogie2988,d43dryv,3,t5_2wbzn

Yeah some parts of the state are redneckconservative in the manner you suggest... but its an inappropriate cliche for many others such as the ones that Boogie mentions above. The progressiveconservative divide thats present in Arkansas isnt all that different from what youd find in a lot of other states... Given the abhorrent politics coming out of just about every state these days its pretty hard to really point at Arkansas in sanctimony.sorry for the rant Im just a little tired of hearing the same jab at my home about its being white trash et al while my immediate neighbors are all A professors at a tier  land grant university or B successful entrepreneurs who are also well educated. Yeah every now and then we get some obnoxiously loud cars driving around town... like the yellow Lamborghini Aventador I saw blasting by while I was on the bike trail yesterday. And then theres been some goofball with a McLaren s or GT I dont know McLarens well that drives a little better than the   GTR owners.
