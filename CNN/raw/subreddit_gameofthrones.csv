13947,0,t1_ceftm3q,What I find really interesting is what we are given in the Melisandre Chapter you have her speaking with Mance about rescuing Jons sister and he suggests that Jon would send his crows because thats what he would do. Melisandre dismisses that telling Mance that Jon has chosen to live and die by his vows then Jon proves Mance right.I think it lends some weight to the theory that Mance wrote the letter not Ramsay.,gameofthrones,ceg0t4m,3,t5_2rjz2
14325,0,t1_ceftm3q,If you really think what motivated Jon to decide to go to Winterfell was the fact that he got a letter from Ramsay addressing him as Bastard then I think you missed the point entirely.

203516,0,t3_1wfwba,So...I think Danys storyline will more or less end with Dany I of ADWD. Keep in mind the following things still need to happen  the march to Meereen problems with food the signposts of dead children. the duel with the champion. planning the assault. the capture of the city. Dany banishing Ser Jorah and learning about her family from Ser Barristan. finding out what happened in Astapor and Yunkai. the  wise masters being punished.Theon I think well definitely get into some ADWD at least as far as Moat Cailin and a bit further. If I had to guess Id say theyd leave it at the reveal that Arya is coming to marry Ramsay. As for Balon...you really think he fell off a bridge for no reason? And I cant disagree more about the religion the religion is what makes them Ironborn and its already been prominently featured in Season .Bran theyre adding new material for. First of all Im going to guess that the Sam meeting Coldhands gets turned into Bran meeting Coldhands. Second Im pretty sure from the casting that theres going to be plenty of stuff happening at Crasters Keep.

510706,0,t1_cfx40qj,ADWDg Sorry for not responding sooner but theres a bunch of small pieces of evidence throughout the series.  The biggest piece of evidence IMO stems from the fact that in the old days lords and kings used to bed with whomever they wanted even if they were married to some other lord.  Its speculated that the Mad King slept with Tywins wife and she got pregnant with Tyrion.  Tyrions mother died during childbirth... same as Daenerys and Jon Snow Jon is of course another suspected Targaryan.  So I think the three heads of the dragon are Jon Dany and Tyrion.  ADWDg Now I also believe that Varys and Illyrio know or suspect this... which is why they have taken such a great interest in Tyrion and have been keeping him alive.  I think Tyrion is a big piece of whatever their plan is.ADWDg Some other circumstantial evidence The Youre no son of mine line from Tywin when Tyrion kills him... mentioned by uQLR below.  Tywin also expresses how much hes done for his family when he shouldve killed Tyrion.  Just watch this exchange between Tywin and Tyrion Tyrion also has one green and one black eye... the colors of the Targs.,gameofthrones,cfybj52,1,t5_2rjz2

If were going by historical accuracy the hammers used throughout the Medieval era were a bit smaller than the average sledgehammer. If you think about it as a soldier you carry the weapon a lot more than you fight with it. Carrying around a huge hunk of metal would kill you before you got to the battlefield. That said this is fantasy so I suppose Roberts weapon could have been  feet long and weighed  lbs.

619089,0,t1_cgaid1s,gt he had so much the advantage being able to strike and withdraw before his opponent could swing.ASOSb Not really. Oberyn uses a spear specifically because the Mountain can pretty much onehand a great sword giving him so much more reach than a normalsized man with a normalsized sword. With a spear Oberyn could match or slightly beat the Mountains reach and considering the spear is the weapon Dornishmen are famous for next to the bow Oberyn was likely better skilled with a spear than a sword anyway and even makes a flippant remark about it. He used the poison to guarantee the Mountains slow and agonizing death Oberyn wanted him to suffer  which suggests Oberyn expected his chances of winning would be low but that wouldnt matter because in return the Mountain would survive the trial allowing him to die by poison instead. Oberyn never had any interest in Tyrion only revenge. I think when Oberyn saw himself winning the fight he realized hed rather die than give the Mountain a clean death. He decides then to riskily try to butcher the Mountain slowly which backfired obviously.,gameofthrones,cgan3fb,3,t5_2rjz2

665330,0,t1_cgfrgdu,Allb Kill the boy become the man. He killed the boy and became the man. Men get killed. Thats how GoT works. You try to learn as many lessons as you can and do as much good as you can before you go but in the end youre a mortal man and All Men Must Die. The Targaryens died and they were dragonriding magicblooded warlords. Jon Snow was a good man and he stuck to his principles and he has one tarnish on his record from lying with Ygritte. He held his honor above all else and because of it he was murdered by those closest to him. Like father like son? Like brother like brother? Eddard Rob Jon the three Stark men. Honor one stain on the record honor leads them to their doom. Its all a symbol and theyre martyrs in their own way. Maybe not to anyone in the books themselves but theyre martyrs to us as readers. As each light of hope and honor gutters and is extinguished we cling harder and harder to those we have left. And the best things weve got now are the reformed Kingslayer a wayward Half Man a impudent Dragon Child a Dragon Queen who cant make up her mind in her loyalties the aspiring and shrewd Queen of Roses a FaceChanger in training and well Prince Tommen the alltooyoung King who proves that sometimes the most blunt honest truths come from the mouths of innocent ignorant children. It all ties in. Jons death hit me hard. He should stay dead. I thought it cheapened Cats death to have her brought back by Rhllor. Melisandre might be able to do it and may very well try but there should be dire consequences.I wish i could do line breaks in spoilers so it wasnt just this wall of text.,gameofthrones,cgfwb93,14,t5_2rjz2

But thats not how a lot of other characters get treated  for example Olena Tyrell is repeatedly described as being utterly insufferable even though the readerviewer gets to enjoy her quips at other characters expense so we like her.Both Stannis and Renly are far more complicated than merely what other characters see.  In Stannis case its virtually a crime how much of him is being left out.  Hopefully theyll turn it around later on as he becomes a bigger part of the action.

783996,0,t1_cgt724w,Let me preface this by stating that Im not sure what the succession laws of Westeros are but if they go anything like medieval Europe which they by and large appear to do than the answer togtwouldnt Margaery now become Queen regent?is No. She has no claim to the throne and women are by and large treated more like property than rulers.  Even though Margaery is queen the minute she marries Joffery the second he dies shes nothing.  Cercei was regent because she was the kings mother and had the most vested interested in seeing him ascend to the throne.  Thats all the regents job is to hold down the fort until the king comes of age comes back home or dies depending on the circumstances of the regency.  If Joffery had become ill or incapacitated it is conceivable that Margaery could have become regent though with a slew of Lannisters around one of them Tywin or Tyrion would likely have slotted in.  With Tommen the presumptive heir the regent will most likely be Cercei or Tywin and Im putting my money on Tywin.  Margaerys only path to the throne now as Queen not as an actual ruler is marrying Tommen.,gameofthrones,cgte754,4,t5_2rjz2

After that we blew straight through S then decided to spread the Gospel of GRRM and introduced everyone we could think of including my conservative inlaws.If you feel lost after the first few eps go back and rewatch. Each time you rewatch an episode youll notice these little things that come up that give you clues and that really make the characters compelling. Even now as the new episodes air we watch them first at release and again later in the week to really get the gist of all the details. There is SO much to see and especially hear. I hope you do get into it. Its very well done. But I do agree with those who say to stay away from anyone whos seen the show or read the books.

785239,0,t3_234vm5,After King Roberts death Stannis is his legal heir as Joffrey Tommen and Myrcella are Jaimes children. He sends ravens out to the entire realm from the island fortress of Dragonstone calling on them to pledge fealty to him. However pretty much everyone ignores him hes not wellliked and has recently been converted to a foreign religion by Melisandre who sees him as a messiahfigure.So Stannis is left with a very small army in comparison to the other kings forcing him to recruit pirates to boost his numbers. He marches against his younger brother Renly who is supported by the lords of the Stormlands Baratheon territory and the Reach Tyrell territory as he has married Margaery Tyrell. At the same time Catelyn Stark is trying to broker an alliance between Renly and Robb and tries to persuade Stannis and Renly to set their differences aside to deal with the Lannisters. They refuse and battle seems imminent.However Melisandres shadowbaby assassinates Renly the following day. The lesser lords of the Stormlands join Stannis while the Tyrells and their vassals go back to their own lands. Stannis sends Melisandre back to Dragonstone on the advice of Ser Davos who distrusts her.With his new armies Stannis sails into Blackwater Bay to capture Kings Landing take the throne and kill Joffrey. However Tyrion uses wildfire to decimate Stanniss army. Ser Davoss ship is destroyed and his son is killed. Stannis presses on regardless but Tywin shows up backed by the Tyrells who have allied with the Lannisters. Stannis retreats to Dragonstone.At the start of season  it is revealed that Davos survived the destruction of his ship. Davos learns that Melisandre has been burning men alive at Dragonstone. He returns to Dragonstone but is imprisoned by Stannis for attempting to assassinate Melisandre. Shortly afterwards Melisandre leaves Dragonstone guided by visions and finds one of King Roberts bastards Gendry the blacksmith with the Brotherhood Without Banners. She brings Gendry to Dragonstone because There is power in a kings blood.In prison Davos is taught to read by Stanniss disfigured daughter Shireen. Stannis frees Davos so that he can witness a demonstration of Melisandres power. She uses three leeches  one for each of the remaining false kings in Westeros Joffrey Baratheon Robb Stark and Balon Greyjoy to extract blood from Gendry and then Stannis burns the leeches.Not long afterwards Robb is killed at the Red Wedding though Davos is sceptical as to whether Melisandres ritual had anything to do with it. Stannis decides to sacrifice Gendry due to the power in his blood. Davos tries to dissuade him from doing so and eventually releases Gendry behind Stanniss back.Stannis is furious and resolves to execute Davos but Davos persuades him instead that he should go north to help the Nights Watch at the Wall. Melisandre agrees and Stannis lets Davos live.At the start of season  Stannis executes several prominent noblemen for refusing to abandon their religion. Davos objects but Stannis ignores him.Edit I apologise for the poor formatting Im terrible at this sort of thing.,gameofthrones,cgtjags,13,t5_2rjz2

787634,0,t3_236426,gt First of all how can something be the best show in the history of television when  per cent of it is lurid sex and violence? Thats like saying Hustler magazine is better than The New Yorker. Not to come off as prudish but lets be honest here. This show is all about sexual intercourse and murder done in armour.Um...  He is coming off as prudish.  You cant say something prudish and then say you arent being prudish to magically nullify it.  The show is most certainly not about sex and murder in fact its the opposite.  Its about the struggles of the characters who will rise to power what is going on in the North will we find out whats going to happen next?The sex is to add to the era show a certain realness of character.  The culture of this world is not something completely fabricated.  Its based off of the Medieval era.  GRRM took humanity and placed them in a new world.  He restarted human history on a new planet just with magic added in.  This is how humans are at least at the time.  Sex and murder were the thing back then.  Thats how you gain power thats how wars are fought thats how most things got done.To exclude sex and murder would make the story unrealistic and it would essentially become a fairytale.  This is how the world works not how you want it to work.  If it was how the fans wanted it Ned Stark would have led the North to kill all the Lannisters and free the throne of tyranny.

The only exception being Roose Bolton because hes just so fucking cool. As powerful and respected Tywin seems to be hes the worst of all. Cunning working the battlefield is one thing but scheming with and buying the Freys so they could do what they did is unforgivable. Remember the Rat Cook. My top choice would be Stannis right now but hes really fucking up. He killed his brother also unforgivable. He needs to put Mel in her place or get rid of her same with his wife. Hes gotta stop threatening his Hand and burning his inlaws. I feel hes under some kind of spell hopefully he snaps his gloomy ass out of it and redeems his taboo act. Westeros has fucked off for long enough it needs Iron Stannis to enforce the laws and bring the realm to heel.

TV shows generally start off episodic every episode is like a mini movie and start to get more serial soapy  you have to watch the whole season to know whats going on.Id say not though. Its always been fairly serial. Its always had a mix of longrunning plots and smaller conflicts that get resolved within the episode. Its not like it started as a monster of the week show and is only just starting to have major arcs. You might be right that its gotten a little less punchy but its nothing like the decay that most TV shows get. Its moved a little towards larger more drawnout conflicts and has fewer adventurous road trips.

820428,0,t1_cgx6mfl,ASOSb Im pretty certain they share a goblet in the books. I believe its the large goblet Mace gives them as a gift and they both drink from it as a symbolic gesture. Supposedly one of the reasons Mace was so set on Tyrion being executed rather than taking the Black was because of how close Margaery came to being poisoned by sharing the same cup. Several options I can think of ASOSb The show reflects what actually happened in the books and Margaery wasnt involved at all. This means Olenna must have been extra careful about when she administered the poison. Or possibly LF lied to Sansa about who administered the poison and how. ASOSb Natalie Dormer doesnt want to spoil anything so shes being careful with her words. ASOSb The show is going a different route from the books.

843973,0,t1_ch07h9a,st of all  if she says no that means no. There really doesnt need to be a followup conversation about whether or not she consented. Saying no means that she did not consent. while she may not have wanted it there... means that she did NOT consent. When Cersie really didnt want to have sex she might have indicated differently... For our purposes we dont need to speculate on how she normally refuses to consent. Saying no is more than sufficient to refuse consent. It doesnt matter what the fictional characters might think that doesnt get to change how Alex Graves and the rest of us in the st century real world define consent. The director is wrong when he says that an encounter like that can become consensual in the end. No it cant thats not how consent works.,gameofthrones,ch07op8,3,t5_2rjz2

852495,0,t3_23vivj,I think this episode and the previous episode serve as moral questions we see two people we have grown to hate victimised in horrible ways. We all cheered last week at the death of a boyking who died of poison in his mothers arms yet a rape scene against a woman with perhaps more villainy to her name we find morally repugnant? I think the purpose of the rape was to serve as a further blow to the Lannister clan. For not only is their boyking dead but now the brother has raped the sister. Its odd but when I ask myself which of the following  events in is the most morally repugnant I arrive at a simple answer the first one. Of the other two Im not sure which is worse but one is certainly more final. The Red Wedding Joffreys death by poison. Cerseis rape by Jaime.At the end of the day Cersei lives through her ordeal and Im not convinced among the other events that it is her who deserved to live not to imply that it wasnt repulsive to watch.

855889,0,t1_ch1gyv7,The entire crux of my post was GoT fans are shrugging off criticism by completely misrepresenting arguments and here you are with about five different Strawmen for me!gtHe pushed bran out of the window and was somehow redeemed by telling the story about how he killed Aerys II.He also saved Brienne from being raped as well as saving her life as well as crucially letting us know more about his personal philosophy in a way we were never shown in previous seasons. He was obviously never completely redeemed but it added depth to the character to find out some of his more sympathetic traits Namely that hes unable to stand by and let horrible things happen to people.gt Thats like saying a pedo isnt that bad because he was touched as a kidThat analogy doesnt work at all pushing a child out of a window to prevent a massive scandal is not an equivalent crime to peadophilia. Obviously both are terrible crimes but one was at the time considered necessary and was not the result of lust or want. While were on that topic the kind of mentality that makes a soldier devalue life is not the same mentality that makes a man devalue rape as an extremely sinister act. Jaime has spent his entire life killing people based on necessity crucially the Mad King. That was an established part of his character. He was never a massrapist and was in fact explicitly antirape as I detailed in my previous comment.gtAnd this is GRRM. Hes all about crushing tropes...  If youre really hoping Jamie is suddenly a white knight than you should go read some LOTR.Barely even worth responding to but ill go for it anyway the scene was consensual in the books with Cersei beckoning Jaime to continue before he starts having sex with her. So GRRM had nothing to do with it and in fact wrote a blog post explaining that the scene is handled very different in the show. And then a blackandwhite argument about how theres apparently no middleground between every character becoming morally bankrupt and a white knight. Do you honestly believe any of these critics got to Season  without being aware of the type of show theyre watching? gtMany husbands think their wives owe them sex. Many dudes and ladies think of rape only being violent bloody and in a dark ally. This is a very human concept.If the Jaime the show has portrayed truly didnt understand that responding to No please no stop with I dont care along with ripping off her dress and pushing her to the ground was rape then either theyve completely forgotten how the character used to be or have completely changed him out of nowhere.

876591,0,t1_ch3q7td,so fwiw since youre being serious this doesnt belong in the cj subreddit so dont worry about that. The reason people are suggesting that is because your post seems to indicate a lot of work for a revelation that is either so farfetched as to be completely dismissable or so meta that it doesnt have anything to do with the actual plot. Will GRRM insert himself as a god figure? everyone is telling you no both because its antithetical to Georges writing style and the themes of the book and because it would be bad trite writing on the level of it was all a dream. Ok so it wont be a plot device is it an intentional reference to the story being a work of fiction? maybe but why is that important? at most it would be a little wink to readersviewers. Obviously youve put some thought into this so dont take the rejection the wrong way but the original post was a bit melodramatic and the idea is really out there so no one was sure whether to take you seriously or not.,gameofthrones,ch3x7nq,1,t5_2rjz2
876662,0,t3_245iiu,Im going to totally theorise here but I think we were just spoiled quite a few ways and we have also possibly had something explained to us. Now Mr Coldhands the weirdly helpful white walker who actually takes Bran north is given what seems to be more intelligence than most of his kind. Reason? Possibly the children of the forest. It may be they gave him that power but in order to save lifehelp the threeeyedcrow. We dont know how long coldhands has been wandering around helping travellers hell the three eyed crow could be controlling coldhands every step of the way we have no true idea. We have no idea if Coldhands is influenced by his king the threeeyedcrow or is totally of his own free will.Assuming coldhands is also trying to keep on the good side of his king to save his own skin he may also be aiding his king and thus we have just seen our first glimpse of Coldhands who set up the baby ritual or the aftermath of Coldhands doing. It may be he only appears on an elk and robed when he meets Bran simply to initially disguise himself and as he has knowledge of what he truly is... I assume Coldhands appearance to Bran is somewhere after Crasters keep. The absence of Coldhands has bothered me for a while he is the reason they survive the north..Next Weeks episode hidden for those who havent seen itg shows Jon Snow at Crasters keep this recapture of those at the keep could be the motivation for making him commander. This would replace the weird mind games played by Sam which seemed loose at best in the books. It saves on getting loads of people in for the choosing ceremony. It gives more of a reason for those who have only seen the series and not read the books to see Jon Snow as a believable Lord Commander. The reasoning for all these changes have likely been OKd by George RR Martin who has huge input on how the series goes and he might see this as a better way to display Jon getting power.My alternative to the baby stealing WW being Coldhands is that WWs have been intelligent all along to some degree. They are under the command of their king so their seemingly mindless acts are simply a compulsion to take orders. Its not hard to imagine a WW letting Craster go. Imagine if you will Crasters first born son hes got probably one wife maybe two likely not very established and doesnt want this son around. He decides to kill the baby using exposure Craster doesnt raise a finger to do much himself so its an easy choice leave it and forget about it. He wanders to the woods to find himself confronted by a WW at that moment he offers the baby to the WW in trade for his own life and promises any future sons to the WW. The WW accepts this offer and so begins the sacrifice of Crasters children the perfect symbiotic relationship for both parties.While confused and sad for Hodor Im happy to see this turn in the story I think its become a lot more interesting than Brans original trip north which was basically a lot of walking in the cold. Its got a lot more possibilities Jon Snow might not even make it out of the north alive but that would ruin so much of the future.,gameofthrones,ch3xi2y,6,t5_2rjz2

Sansa is the biggest inconsistancy as she stated in season  that she was  so should now be  going on  but told Tyrion on her wedding night that she was only ...by now Arya should be  as she was  in season .A few inconsistencies exist with Cercies age too as she should be in her mids but has stated events and things that she remembers that she shouldnt even have been born for unless she was in her mids.Also IF Roberts Rebellion was  years before the start of the show then given that Danys pregnant mother was smuggled out off Dragonstone during the Rebellion then she must have been  when it started?,gameofthrones,ch48oy7,5,t5_2rjz2

IF you rewatch carefully youll see that Olenna is always sitting very close next to that that old dude next to her dunno his name.  But the scene which shows the arrival of the wedding pie and we saw the BACK of Olennas head and it shows that she was pretty FAR from the old guy whos head showed up a second later.  It means at that time when everyone is looking at the arrival of the Pie she MOVED toward the end of Joffrys table instead of standing at her seat. That is when she slipped the poison in his cup which is near the far edge of his table.  Its a pretty cleaver trick by the director!,gameofthrones,ch4wio7,1,t5_2rjz2

In any case if Olenna did not murder Joffrey and exposedblackmailed Littlefinger her reputation would come into question why did Littlefinger think she might want to murder Joffrey? and in the meantime Margery is still married to the psychopath. I think one of Olennas terms must have been to have a person between her and the murder thus implicating Sansa.

Regardless of them being strong and shit I doubt they have a chance against the seven kingdoms. After all that time plotting and gathering men he would spread thin and throw it all away to kill everyone? The wall is first then he needs a foothold and that means manning every castle and even building walls for the keeps on the southern side. He is far from the goal you talk about.Edit I of course forgot about the dragonglass being one of the only things to destroy them. I also forgot the fact that the long night they DID try to kill everyone but were stopped when the children and first men found out dragonglass stopped them and pushed them back. Lack of children of the forest to make the dragonglass for men might pose a HUGE problem in the others being stopped. My theory is that the dragons are going to come into play in the defeating of the others this time. It seems like the only option now.

902119,0,t1_ch6ssc9,Context Septon Meribald talking to Breinne and Podrick.More less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men driven by greed soured by malice despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are commonborn simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad they march away beneath his banners ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers sons with fathers friends with friends. Theyve heard the songs and stories so they go off with eager hearts dreaming of the wonders they will see of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure the greatest most of them will ever know. Then they get a taste of battle. For some that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundredandfirst. Brothers watch their brothers die fathers lose their sons friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after theyve been gutted by an axe. They see the lord who led them there cut down and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound and when thats still halfhealed they take another. There is never enough to eat their shoes fall to pieces from the marching their clothes are torn and rotting and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water. If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm they need to take them from a corpse and before long they are stealing from the living too from the smallfolk whose lands theyre fighting in men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens and from there its just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They dont know where they are or how to get back home and the lord theyre fighting for does not know their names yet here he comes shouting for them to form up to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them faceless men clad all in steel and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world And the man breaks. He turns and runs or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain or steals away in the black of night and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day from meal to meal more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these the traveler must beware of broken men and fear thembut he should pity them as well.,gameofthrones,ch6tqp7,57,t5_2rjz2

914096,0,t3_24klg8, Join the rasoiaf subreddit Read the Novellas which are awesome as their own stories but mainly serve to provide parallels to characters and plotlines in the main series also to give extra worldbuilding information.  Youll likely learn a lot about the direction the future books are going in by reading these. Read up on topics on A Wiki of Ice and Fire you can lose yourself on that site. Listen to podcasts like History of Westeros and Vassals of Kingsgrave on Youtube for topics you want to know more about. Play the A Game of Thrones mod for the video game Crusader Kings II.  It takes a while to learn the mechanics but there will never be a better or more commited to canon ASOIAF video game. Reread and reread again.  Pick a topic like What is going to happen to character name in the next book? then read again with mainly that in mind and see what clues and patterns you can decipher to predict where their story is going to go. Read the  Moments of Foreshadowing threads on westeros.org forums to learn how to analyze the patterns in Georges writing then have fun projecting the future of the story and coming up with wild theories.   Read some of the  posts in the Heretics Guide to Heresy topics on westeros.org to start thinking differently about the themes of the books. Read the amazing blogs my favourites are Wars and Politics of Ice and Fire The Winterfell Huis Clos and The Meereenese Blot,gameofthrones,ch86svc,2,t5_2rjz2

925339,0,t3_24l769,The title is an obvious reference to Tommen being crowned but what are the double meanings. I think this will be the episode where Dany says I will rule from the trailers.Cersei and Margery going to both try to manipulate Tommen. I think Cersei might realize something is happening behind her back after that scene in the teaser with tommen smiling at Marg and cersei getting inbetween. I think we will have at least one more jaimetyrion cell scene before the trial where Tyrion learns Pod got away safely. I doubt we will see Brienne and if we do it will be a very short scene. She needs to get farther from Kings Landing before anything significant happens. And lastly I hope we see more of this Nights King which Im still not convinced is legit.

936418,0,t1_chapjki,To continue and expand a bitgtAlso I cant tell if they are being mean or not to each other in this scene.Sort of both... Margaery wants to be the queen and Cersei wants Margaerys father to vote Guilty in Tyrions trial for the murder of her son. In this scene I felt like they were sort of coming to a mutual agreement to give each other what they want while at the same time taking pot shots at each other... Whether either or both were sincere about giving the other what they want I dont know.gtDaario and the ships. What did he do that he was told he wasnt instructed to do?He captured the Navy of the city that they took over. I think the important thing is that he did it without Dany instructing him to do so. Up until now Dany has kind of had complete control over her army and its liberating actions. I think that this is the first display of her not having total control of all of her subjects which later gets highlighted by the news of the cities she liberated earlier starting to slip out of her control.gtWhy does Jorah say some think Tommen is a bastard that doesnt deserve the throne? Isnt he the son of Cersei and the King that died in a hunting accident?As the other poster said Tommen and Joffrey is the son of Cersei and her twin brother Jaime... This is kind of the driving force of the overall plot in the first season  Id suggest rewatching the first season if anyone missed this...gtWhat was Robyn saying when Little Finger quieted her?I think you mean Lysa not Robyn. She was talking about how Littlefinger had her poison her previous husband Jon Arryn and convinced her sister Catelyn Stark that the Lannisters were behind the murder. This event kicked off the entire series in the first episode of the show and lead to Ned Stark becoming the new Hand of the King Jon Arryn was the Hand before he was killed. This is a very big revelation because up until this point the viewers were entirely lead to believe that the Lannisters were actually behind the plot. Instead it has been Littlefinger pulling the strings and causing pretty much most of the major events of the series up until this point. If you have the ability I would really recommend rewatching from the first season  you will probably catch on to a lot of things that werent apparent on your first viewing.,gameofthrones,chaq56l,2,t5_2rjz2

He is the last surviving member from what is often regarded as the greatest Kingsguard ever one where Jaime is regarded as one of the least skilled. Sure hes probably slowed a little in his old age but hes far more experienced and he keeps himself in such good shape some characters note hes as fit as a man half his age.

952095,0,t1_ch9wbsy,yes it is sorry for late reply.  When storming a castle wall the edges are even and easily used with a ladder well apart from the men at the top wanting to kill you.  For a cliff which is uneven at best you will need more than just ladders.  Also one assumes that these cliffs are higher further away from the gate as the pass road had been cut out of them in earlier times presumably by Bran the Builder or some other great wizard of a bygone age.  but even so assuming that you could climb an army up in some distant place.  You would also have to climb up supplies which would mean a great deal of work and time spent doing so which would set you up for ambush from armies within the Vale.  This also keeps the Vale safe as they can use skeleton crew harrying forces and horse as skirmishers and retreat back up the road when chased.  The position is far more secure than just climbing them far away from the gate as you suggest.We arent talking about a party of well trained saboteurs like Jon Snows wildling bunch that climbed the wall we are talking about an army capable of taking the Vale which would need to be thousands strong.  With all the supplies that such a thing entails.  That is no small task to take a cliff.,gameofthrones,chcif0o,1,t5_2rjz2

957396,0,t1_chd3rbu,Right but you said the author acknowledges it as such which in fact he doesnt. All he said was that the scene was meant to be disturbing but that Cersei did want it.

959056,0,t3_252tbg,Littlefinger and Varys are by far the most interesting to me because they are so cunning and unpredictable. We have some idea of who they really are but not what they are up to. Every little hint they drop is valuable information for the viewers. They need only to speak for the scene to be intriguing. In contrast Tywin and Olenna are also very cunning but are somewhat predictable because we know their motives.Also Theon. When the war begun he already was destined to lose no matter what because he had to choose between his birth family and his ward family. Family is everything in Westeros so had he betrayed his birth familyno matter how cruel they were it wouldnt be long before he is seen in the bad light throughout Westeros. And obviously betraying the Starks did not do him any good either. He is arguably the most conflicted character.Lastly Arya. She has been trying to survive for so long while witnessing the murders of her family. She has gone through so much yet remains strong. But she is also vengeful leading her into a very dark path. Its only a matter of time before she snaps at the world.,gameofthrones,chdaxtp,3,t5_2rjz2

981860,0,t1_chfl1ff,With a heavy heart I have to respectfully disagree... well partly actually. Alfie Allen is doing a bang up job so far but the Reek scenes in the book are far more intense and with much more despair. The show has done an adequate job of giving a hint of what hes gone through but not nearly at the level of the books.I know this just sounds like Im being an arse but there is a severe lack of Reek Reek. Im Reek it rhymes with squeek. Id compare his insanity at the level of Gollum. Reek should be truly insane and more mentally unstable. He shouldnt even sound like Theon anymore. I wish the show would have gone all out in his transformation. When we look at Reek we shouldnt she Theon but some pathetic remnant of a man that sorta resembles Prince Theon of the House Greyjoy.Im hoping we have just gotten a taste of the beginning of his downward spiral and that future episodes will show him much deeper down the rabbit hole.

982374,0,t1_chfsx23,Shae was the tie that bound both Sansa and Tyrion as being guilty. The testimony of the necklace points at Sansa which i swear Baelish had but need to re watch more than Tyrion.  Shae tied him to Sansas alleged deceit.  Not that Tyrion would throw her under the bus it still is wise to tie him to the person with more motive and connection.  It also allowed her to toss out on record the marriage was not consummated. So now Sansa has no claim to any inheritance.  If they want to try her as well they can if they want to marry her off again she is still a maid. . . it wins on both fronts.  It also means that if Sansa were to get pregnant with someone elses child she can not claim it is  a Lannister.   I think Shae was there more about Sansa than Tyrion.  Sansa being the culprit does not seem that far fetched I would not be surprised if Tywin thinks Sansa is guilty anyway so this is a way to get the truth and screw over Tyrion in his eyes.    ,gameofthrones,chfycrf,19,t5_2rjz2

There might also have been environmental factors like higher global temperatures or warm ocean currents that allowed medditeranean classical nations support such large populations.  The Reach Tyrells might be able to field a million man army but they are the most populous region in Westeros.  They also have nearly no battle experience.  k could have a chance but they would need allies eventually and a plan for winning them.  ,gameofthrones,chhhraz,2,t5_2rjz2

997868,0,t1_chhno9l,For me I understand why they went with that ending. It was clearly mapped out from the start. What bothered me about it is how they executed it. It was very poorly done. The creators clearly recognized that Ted had a lot of chemistry with the Mother and Robin and Barney made a good couple. Particularly with the latter pair they kept pushing that relationship like it was endgame. They based the entire last season around the weekend of Robin and Barneys wedding. To sit through  episodes about this goddamn wedding and several seasons of will they or wont they with Robin and Barney only to undo it all  minutes into the final episode and revert Barney back to his old ways was horribly lazy and rushed. It made a lot of long time fans feel like the last few seasons particularly the final season was a complete waste of time. Plus it really trivialized the Mothers importance in the story by leaving her fate to be told in a quick montage. There were a million ways to do that exact same ending and they picked the worst one. It would have been controversial but Ted should have met the Mother at the end of season beginning of season  or at least by midseason and then spent the remaining episodes setting up what happened in the finale. ,gameofthrones,chhpqzb,23,t5_2rjz2

Jaime is on a redemption arc but this is no where near the worst thing hes done and its precisely because I dont sympathize with Cersei that I wasnt too upset with Jaime by the scene. The victim in this case does matter when it comes to what we think of Jaime at least for me. If it was someone like Brienne or Sansa it would be obviously much different.The main argument I saw was concerning whether or not it was rape which is an entirely different question. I obviously think it was. I just dont think I should have to feel remotely bad about it. Thats why I made my initial comment which prompted a bunch of people to say You think she deserved ityou were cheering for her rape. I also think its okay to acknowledge that there are degrees to how bad a rape can be and this one was relatively mild when it comes to the Game of Thrones world. That sounds weird to say but its Game of Thrones. Fucked up sit happens constantly. My bet would be Cersei barely cares it happened anymore.

1031915,0,t1_chljlc2,I agree it sounds like epilepsy. Often when a child has prolonged seizures they dont actually breath and this causes some level of injury to the brain.  In addition the seizures themselves can be prolonged and cause an exhaustion of the neurotransmitters of the brain which lead to developmental delay.  Occasionally seizures can even be prolonged and occur in areas of the brain that cause outbursts in emotion sometimes these will progress further to cause actual physical signs shaking but often they may just effect the persons mentality.  Obviously he was also a spoiled brat amidst all of this.  So when you combine this fact and the fact hes developmentally delayed you can easily see how you can get a little delusioned crazy Robin running around thinking hes the end all be all. ,gameofthrones,chll0vw,12,t5_2rjz2

Yes hes saving his skin but being righteous and offering to fight for Tyrion wouldnt get him anything but most likely dead. And even if she didnt kill him... hed have to fight the fucking Mountain.

The show may have already filled some roles and that is why some parts are not present.and accordingly  panic or  assume that characters X Y and Z will be cut.There is no indication that the show is going to suddenly veer sharply from the books. On the contrary despite peoples constant attempts to expecthopewishfear that the show will leave out some character location or storyline it has not left out any nonminor storyline location or character in . seasons and counting. let alone a PoV. Heck it has even included or will include characters that are so minor andor fungible as to puzzle readers Styr the Magnar of Thenn is a perfect recent example and Areo Hotah and Lollys are two more examples we now know from this leak are coming.Quentyn Martell by contrast is a PoV character whose story intersects with Danys. Why would any TV show ever resist the chance to portray a love story even if in this case it is oneway? Quentyn plays an important part of Danys storylines as he Daario and Hizdahr compete to win her. Expect a cute young actor to be cast and for DanyQuentyn shippers to argue on Tumblr with DanyDaario and even a few DanyHizdahr fans.He has the single best death in the series. Better than Viserys better than Oberyn. In  pages he is the first PoV to die by dragonfire. Yes Strong Belwas and Patchface are minor characters.

1101186,0,t3_26qb7l,So first as a distinction tinfoil usually refers to a theory with little or no evidence that people might hold as a joke. RLJ is not a tinfoil theory it is extremely common among fans and heavilyevidenced.Some assorted theories about the series up to the point where we are in the show. Some of these are more likely than others. I dont necessary believe in any or all of these RLJ Jon Snow is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. This is the most common ASOIAF fan theory. You can read about it here scroll down to III. RHAEGAR TARGARYEN AND LYANNA STARK Southron Ambitions A theory that certain noble houses Stark Tully Arryn and Baratheon were secretly plotting with Rhaegar Targaryen to overthrow Aerys II. Rhaegar ended up accelerating the plan when he abducted Lyanna Stark Rhaegars harp is hidden in the crypts of Winterfell in Lyannas tomb and is part of the proof that Jon is his son Benjen Stark joined the Nights Watch out of guilt because he knew the truth about why Lyanna ran off with Rhaegar and kept it a secret getting his father brother and thousands of others killed Melisandre saw Dragonstone in her fires and assumed it meant Stannis was Azor Ahai reborn. It actually meant that the heir to Dragonstone Rhaegars son Jon is Azor Ahai Littlefinger not Cersei hired Mandon Moore to try and kill Tyrion during the Battle of the Blackwater Grand Tyrell Conspiracy The Tyrells have been secretly plotting to overthrow the Baratheons and Lannisters for some time Roose Bolton is immortal and using dark magic and flayed skins to keep himself looking young and to change identities Melisandre is undead and glamoring herself to appear younger Syrio Forel and Jaqen Hghar are the same person Meera Reed is Jons twin sister and the daughter of Rhaegar and Lyanna Benjen Stark is still alive Syrio is not deadThere are a ton of other theories I didnt mention because I dont know if youve read the books.,gameofthrones,chtgkzv,1,t5_2rjz2

1107937,0,t1_chu7fzn,I appreciate the courtesy in understanding the behavior as oneoff.Specifically the only rule I see that I might have broken is The books and show contain adult content. This sub is not restricted to  but maturity is expected to participate here.This rule is vague enough to cover a lot of content in this subreddit even if that content does not remain with the spirit of the rule in its inception which seems to more speak to treating the adult content on the show in mature manner.I guess where I take minor issue is in the specificity of the rules language toward the show itself. I was commenting in a thread that was already offtopic as it was a reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail and I made a poor attempt to continue in a comedic vein when I saw the word clop repeated. As I had seen similarly NSFW subreddits posted in a post about which subreddits GoT characters would sibscribe to I was not certain there was a hard line I had crossed.Im left with a couple questions . Would I have crossed this line if I had not provided the subreddit as a link? and . Would I have crossed a line had I tagged the subreddit as NSFW?Finally to avoid any further confusion why not plainly state in a rule that no NSFW material unrelated to the show or books will be tolerated?,gameofthrones,chu8ahp,1,t5_2rjz2
1107961,0,t1_chu82d4,Hes Saddened by having to kill his brother but he also believed that it had to be done. Renly offered me a peach. At our parley. Mocked me defied me threatened me and offered me a peach. I thought he was drawing a blade and went for mine own. Was that his purpose to make me show fear? Or was it one of his pointless jests? When he spoke of how sweet the peach was did his words have some hidden meaning? The king gave a shake of the head like a dog shaking a rabbit to snap its neck. Only Renly could vex me with a piece of fruit. He brought his doom on himself with his treason but I did love him Davos. I know that now. I swear I will go to my grave thinking of my brothers peach.

Theres too much good I could say about that portion of the book but specifically when he was sent out to kill Mance I didnt care if he died because he had already been the center of some of my favorite events in the books. The funny part about it is that even though I know its going to be entirely different and I respect that one of the smallest changes is the one thats gonna piss me off the most.

One of them pulls a sword during the discussion breaking some cardinal rule which gives Littlefinger the ability to rule in a probationary manner.

1137708,0,t3_274lwq,hi! I just wanted to say that you are right that the world that GRRM and the HBO show paints is extremely bleak. and its hard to take that episode after episode. butand I would argue the same is true of AMCs Walking Deada lot of the beauty of the show lies in its moments of hope. Jon amp Ygritte kissing at the top of the wall Jamies gifts to Brienne hot pies breads for arya. I know theyre fleeting as those moments are in life too but they shape who these characters are as do their decisions in the darker moments. without the other wildlings around her Y doesnt need to kill Gilly and her baby Danys merciful exile of Jorah... maybe try to reset your expectations from this being a grand story of redemption youve come to the wrong place to it being a series of vignettes some tragic others a little less so but all beautifully brought to life. and also maybe dont watch Walking Dead that shit is heavy on the soul for real. ,gameofthrones,chxlpi8,4,t5_2rjz2

Whatever redemption Jamie was headed toward gets derailed as Cersei crawls the rest of the way into her wine bottle and he has no one to interact with other than his father and Merryn Trent.   Bronn turns out to be an exceptionally dull character without Tyrion to prop him up.

1154272,0,t1_chz4aq8,I find the fact that they missed crucial details about Sansas aunt Lysa quite tragic as well. Not really a spoiler considering shes dead in the show but here is her backstory ACOKb So one night Petyr Littlefingers real name gets heavily drunk due to Cats rejection and Lysa comes to have sex with him while he is lying in a bed. Either he mistakes her for Cat or she pretends to be Cat but I like to think the latter  its a classic teen soap opera story. After his fight with Brandon Stark where he gets gravely injured Lysa nurses him back to health. They continue their sexual relationship only this time Petyr knows its Lysa and not Cat. This leads him to believe he took the maidenheads of both Tully sisters. Lysa eventually gets preggo but her Dad forces her to abort the baby. He then marries her off to Jon Arryn who is at the time old enough to be her grandfather.Jon Arryn sees sex as a duty and is quite probably disgusted by Lysas lack of a maidenhead. The only reason he marries her is because he couldnt produce an heir from his two previous wives that survived infancy and Lysa has proven to be a fertile woman. In return Hoster Tully Lysas Dad got the Vales forces and Jons alliance in his rebellion against the Targaryens. We have a classic Daenerys situation  a girl being sold to a much older in this case to a disgusting extent man in return for an army and an alliance but there was no love like the one we saw between Daenerys and Drogo. Lysa has several miscarriages and Robert Robin in the show is the only one who survives infancy. Obviously all the wrongs that have been done to her have taken a huge mental toll on her. Readers at least have an inkling of understanding why she spoils Robin so much. It is very very sad that the last words she hears before being murdered by her one true love is that he loved Only Cat. But to the showwatchers it was just another batshit crazy person getting what was coming to them.,gameofthrones,chzgz7j,1,t5_2rjz2

1155816,0,t3_27cmnq,Hard to say since different story arcs are being messed with along the way.  Some have been fast forwarded up in  and  already while others are being expended where they were still half way through  with side pieces like the return to Crasters Keep.  I take it as just their way to try to make it more chronological than what the books were for a better flow which was admittedly tough when  finally came out and we had to back ourselves up in the storylines to where  started instead of where it ended.  But if I had to guess I would say they have  seasons they can still go before WoW needs to be worried over.  And speaking of which  I am also guessing that we still might see another split like  and  out of the original planned  for one or both of the unreleased books.

Obviously shes not aware of Varys or Illyerio so how can she see his side? He got a pardon signed by the man who destroyed the Targaryean dynasty and she isnt expected to be a bit more pissed? I would of think she would have killed him. He didnt apologize and he didnt come forward himself he let someone else reveal is intentions whether he still held them or not at this point.

1160526,0,t3_27e8yl,okay i am going to make some assumptions. I promise you i am not a book reader but purely a show watcher. Tyrion while found guilty and sentances to death manages to make an escape. he enjoys living and is willing to do it in exile. He most likely gets some sort of help from his brother Jaimie. Now Arya The Hound and Sansa are all in the vale! Except Arya will not trust Little Finger and I doubt Little Finger will trust Arya. but the hound is going to be protecting Arya so shell basically be untouchable BUT! that nasty little cut the hound has will probably rear its head again a seemingly harmless cut killed Drogo the hound complained about it in the last episode Jon...well Jon likely disobeys some order that helps them fend off the wildlings long enough to either escape or keep them at bay. Him and red head might meet again and red head will probably get merked. and uhh lets seee...thats about it so far.

1168375,0,t3_27hzhv,I have a few ideas that might explain why its so popular . the uniquediverse characters . the fact that GRRM is helping HBO transfer his work to the screen . its one of the only honest shows on TV The books are masterpieces the depth of his characters and the imagination to combine an ancientmystical world with modern conceptions of morality makes it identifiable with nearly everyone. But make no mistake the strength of the franchise and GRRMs writing is his polarizing characters and their development. Have you ever hated a character more than Cersei? Have you ever rooted for a couple like you rooted for Jon and Ygritte? The characters are so vastly diverse as well. Almost any person can watchread GOT and immediately identify with one of the characters  whether you identify with Tyrion Sansa Davos Lady Olenna Tywin etc.  However one of the most fundamental aspects contributing to the shows greatness is the fact that GRRM writes most of the scripts to ensure the translation from book to screen is seamless. Also one thing I noticed the really important scenes are usually taken straight out of the book some of them go line for line  which I love. They know where they have some intellectual freedom and they know when to tear out a page and write script on the top. This plays into my untainted thesis. Its also untainted in the way that well its not Hollywoodized to the extreme like so many other popular shows. The characters are real people who have real indepth conversations and problems. Just like in real life the show blurs the lines between religion and magic honor and duty even life and death. This is why I say it is one of the only honest shows on TV. Reading the book is almost exactly like living a day on earth. We are changing our perceptions of the people in our lives everyday learning new details connecting historical dots we are constantly considering the meaning of life  wondering whos gods are real and whos arent does eternal life exist what does death entail. These are honest worthwhile questions and debates that we have everyday on earth and they share in Westeros and the rest of the known world.Hope some of this makes sense!,gameofthrones,ci1296v,3,t5_2rjz2

And although the white walkers have been looming as a threat and winter is coming I just havent really thought about what the stakes are.  Ice zombies are coming... I imagine thats a big deal.I think I would have preferred an hour long episode of Tyrion and Jamie quietly talking about their retard cousin than watch a battle between characters I barely care about.

Its barely worked out of an ore state and its full of dirt and sand and never heated to a molten state long enough to boil out the impurities.

1195681,0,t3_27t54c,ASOS MAJOR SPOILERSb Seriously nonreaders. Turn back now. As a preface please keep in mind that this list only confirms what is certainly in the episode but doesnt confirm exclusions since it only contains the list of scenes with such amountquality of prosthetic work that the department has deemed it significant enough to submit for consideration. There could be other prostheticinvolving scenes in the episode and they could pull off both LSH and the Children without heavy use of prosthetics. That being said I am still absolutely confident that LSH will close out the finale for three main reasons . Common sense. This is literally the greatest cliffhanger they could ever come up with and it would be absolutely abysmal writing from DampDs part fair enough weve seen some of that this season but nothing of this magnitude if they hadnt put it at the end of a season finale. And lets be honest S would be too late for multiple reasons. First of all they cant sideline Michelle Fairley for two entire seasons and expect her to stay committed to the show unless they pay her for two years while she does nothing which would be piss poor budgeting. Secondly this is the perfect moment to maximize the impact on nonreaders. If they wait another year the memory of the RW will be way too far away and the impact will be diminished. . There is no fraking way Lena Headey would have posted this on instagram a year earlier than it was relevant. I think this picture is a surefire confirmation. . The soundtrack for S has just been released on itunes and the last track which shares the title of the final episode  The Children is just way too perfectly suited for the reveal. Here is how I see it going down the first  seconds play over the scene but before we could see LSH herself then at  we get the reveal underscored by the King In The North theme  I mean is there any other reason this theme would be playing anywhere in this episode?! I cant think of anything! We hold on Cats face for a bit and then cut to the credits at . Ill buy you a beer if Im wrong about this.. Is there any way to do paragraph breaks within the spoiler tag?

1210057,0,t1_ci5p6ns,No. It follows being courteous when there are hundreds of thousands to millions of people who are very interested in not having something spoiled. As time goes on things pass into general knowledge and then they slip into just not being mentioned anymore. If youre going to show someone Star Wars who hasnt been exposed to or understood references you do the original trilogy first then the prequels. And for the love of god dont spoil it. Not because it hasnt passed some magical period after which spoiling things is fine but because its the notdick thing to do. And there are varying degrees of not spoiling things. Just using some caution is a nice thing to do for other people.TLDR Using common sense and not being a dick is about all there is to it.,gameofthrones,ci5qzzu,7,t5_2rjz2

The giant would certainly have completely changed the tide of the battle at castle black had the giant made it through he definitely would have changed the outcome how could the watch deal with him AND the southern raiding party? In an enclosed space like the tunnel the giant couldnt use his size as much it was much easier and more effective to take him out at this point the decision from Jon to do so probably won them the battle.,gameofthrones,ci65107,4,t5_2rjz2

There are four kings in the realm and three of them have more men and more gold than I do. I have ships ... and I have her. The red woman. Half my knights are afraid even to say her name did you know? If she can do nothing else a sorceress who can inspire such dread in grown men is not to be despised. A frightened man is a beaten man. And perhaps she can do more. I mean to find out. When I was a lad I found an injured goshawk and nursed her back to health. Proudwing I named her. She would perch on my shoulder and flutter from room to room after me and take food from my hand but she would not soar. Time and again I would take her hawking but she never flew higher than the treetops. Robert called her Weakwing. He owned a gyrfalcon named Thunderclap who never missed her strike. One day our greatuncle Ser Harbert told me to try a different bird. I was making a fool of myself with Proudwing he said and he was right. Stannis Baratheon turned away from the window and the ghosts who moved upon the southern sea. The Seven have never brought me so much as a sparrow. It is time I tried another hawk Davos.

Jojen and his sister Meera came to Bran from a house that was always friendly with the Starks.  Jojen has visions and his visions told him to lead Bran to North of the wall so that he could meet the three eyed raven.  In visions Bran always saw the three eyed raven and a tree on a hill the one from last nights episode.  His whole goal this season was to make it to that tree for some reason.  You dont know yet why that is but you do know that the three eyed raven is the guy who was in the roots of the tree.  Jojen through his visions knew they would make it to the tree and he also knew he was going to die the way he did.  Thats why when they were held captive by the renegade Nights Watch he knew he wouldnt die there.

Theres a very widely accepted theory for where the storys going for which the only evidence is in those first two books but its still speculation anyway. After that point the two media start diverging wildly. At the current moment Jon still has several chapters of ASOS to go Tyrion Dany Jorah Arya and Jaime are more or less at the right point for the next part of their story in AFFCADWD though Jaimes and Tyrions final ASOS chapters have been utterly butchered to the point where youd be confused as hell having not read them. Jorahs also been made a lot more sympathetic though the meat of his story is the same. Bran and Reek are well into their ADWD storylines Sansa has moved past the current books and now theyre making shit up. Briennes off doing her own thing right now though it shouldnt be too hard to get her back on track. Several characters from the books dont appear at all in the show Strong Belwas Coldhands various fools and prophets while others are still alive at this point in the books Jojen Xaro Xhoan Daxos Grenn so youd be pretty confused about who they are and what theyre doing.,gameofthrones,ci8u86k,8,t5_2rjz2

They would have had to remind us of Tysha once or twice this very season to prime this discussion and they chose to avoid it entirely and its really not that hard to understand why. They are changing his motivations and his bitterness about love and whores will most likely be transposed into one about Shae since his relation towards Shae was much more complex and deeper in the show than in the book. TV has to be simpler than books it has to have a lesser number of significant characters especially minimize off screen characters that are just spoken about there is nothing more confusing for an average TV audience than important never seen characters that are rarely mentioned.So TV Tyrion is less tormented and has slightly different motives than book Tyrion? Welcome to the reality of lth TV shows versus the reality of  pages long narratives. I absolutely have no idea what most of you were expecting. They pretty much HAD to exclude that confusing discussion.,gameofthrones,ci8vs11,8,t5_2rjz2

Theres no way hes anything other than a complete baddy!If the story had started from Cerseis point of view you wouldve thought Eddard Stark was an awful man whose only purpose in life was to bring down the Lannisters. Cersei is just an innocent mother who was forced into a marriage with a fat brute and Eddard Stark is here to reveal her deepest secret the only thing that has ever brought her joy in life to the world. aIf GRRM wanted he couldve made you weep like a little girl when Oberyn was winning the duel against the Mountain. You would see the gentle giant that constantly has to chug Milk of the Poppy to ease his constant pains that follows the Lannisters orders because he has no other choice being beat up by a cocky butthurt prince from Dorne all because Gregor followed orders. Gregor didnt deserve this. All he did was follow Tywins orders which were given during a time of war!Yes the Mountain may seem like pure bad guy but so did so many other characters.

1247520,0,t3_28dswz,Well not so much predictions but what Im curious about is this.If Dany isnt in the th book like Ive read on here and they already skipped ahead to the th book then how much if at all will she be in Season  and if so how much will just be made up and not taken from the books?  Same question for Jon Bran North Of the Wall which I believe has skipped past the current book they were working from.Dany already seemed to have very little to do this season after so much character development in the last couple of seasons that I have found her a bit boring.  Again shes not in the book that Season  will be pulling its storys from so I dont think well see much of her...Anyway my predictionsHopes for next season as a whole will includeStanis Davis Jon Snow Mance Ryder leading the army of wildlings south to reclaim the north.Roose Bolton and Ramsey fighting to keep the north  possibly with some involvement from Littlefinger and EvilSansaArya will continue to be developing as a bad ass in Bravaas.  I dont think well see much from her beyond her journey to be awesome.  I doubt well see her having any major involvement in anyone elses storylines.  Maybe Brieanne spreading news of Aryas sighting to Sansa or Cersie and her new whereabouts being discussed but not really much happening with her  I think well have big major involvement from her in the future....but not yet.In Kings Landing I think there will be some initial fall out from Tyrion escaping and Tywin being dead.  Im going to guess that Jamie will tell Cersie either than HE killed Tywin and then let Tyrion go to frame him or that he let Tyrion go in exchange for killing Tywin to protect Tommen and ensure she doesnt have to marry Loras.  Cersie will forgive him and the real battle of the season will be Cersie vs Margarey for control of TommenIm wondering if Varys will end up with Dany we know he was instrumental in her getting where she is now he was a slave in Essos he set up her wedding the eggs Jorah and Barrison....perhaps he might actually get to her now to help.Ive no idea whats happening with Bran and The Children.  That whole part of the story has been the least interesting to me so far so now these freeky kids have become involved Im a bit more interested in where its going to go from here.One other thing I noticed in the finale while none of the friends I watched it with noticed so might require a rewatch was the way The Red Woman looked at Jon Snow during the burning ceremony.  I thought she looked somewhat frightened or shocked to see him.  I think hes not who he says he is and that she can tell.  Im thinking the black hair bastard son Ned came back from the rebellion with that hes going to be a bastard of Roberts rather than Neds and Ned took the blame so Robert could take the throne.  ,gameofthrones,ci9ymhj,2,t5_2rjz2

1269735,0,t1_cicgbzx,Haha you make great points man and I respect that but you gotta shorten up your comments cause Im half asleep right now and its hard to take all this in at once but Ill just respond with your point with Tyrion and Tywin for now. I honestly think that was totally justified. Tywin was a total piece of shit father for everything he did to Tyrion but I could have overlooked that but when he sentencing him to death that was the last straw really. At that point I saw his father as more of a monster then anything so that was totally justifiable in my eyes. On the other hand Renly and Stannis could have talked it out hell even joined forces and later down the road figure it out they didnt completely hate each other. Tywin hated Tyrion all of his life. Although it caught me off guard when Tyrion killed Tywin I see it as just. Yes they were blood BUT Tywin NEVER treated Tyrion like a son. So i will be hypocritical in this situation yes in certain circumstances i wouldnt say its okay... But Tywin had it coming to him. ,gameofthrones,cicgmzj,1,t5_2rjz2

1275927,0,t1_ciczck5,If anyone is still wondering on the ones you werent  on.  No deaths this episode could be a reference to Bran wishing he were dead because of the fall.  Not sure if that is covered in the show though. Is the death of  members of the  after Pree and Xaro  rebel and steal Danys dragons. Pree dies in the House of the Undying after to Danys dragons. This is referencing the  northern prisoners slaughtered at Harrenhal. the scene referenced isnt a death scene probably because the only possible death that could have been was Hoster Tully. The Fist of the First Men battle  I dont really understand because the line referenced is from Season  after Brans fall and the only Sept of Baelor references would be pending marriages? This is the only one that seemed truly out of place to me.  For sure the Sam the Slayer episode.  Im pretty late to the game but if anyone was wondering those were the others.

If its actionpacked like ASOS and it probably will be since it is apparently the second last book of the series they might have to take  seasons to cover it like they did with ASOS. If GRRM is very quick about writing the last book that could mean he gets it out just before the the show catches up to him. But its probably unlikely. What will happen if the book isnt out by the time the show catches up is the show will just continue on with the plotlines GRRM has told them about.

George RR Martin chose DampD to do the adaptation because he knows that they will do a good job at telling the story but it wont be the exact same story. The events everyone are upset were left out werent feasible to be included. Characters that are the product of internal monologues in the book are just as real as characters that someone interacts with. On TV shows they are far less real. The emotional impact for the show watcher was greater as a result of this change. In addition what people thought should have been the SE final scene wouldnt have worked with the pacing of the show.

They said the effort was not worthwhile unless there was some greater meaning or relevance to the role.  I can agree with all that other than I always thought GRRM did have a purpose in mind for Stoneheart.  So either DampD dont know it yet they do know but theyre delaying Stoneheart till the character is more important later or GRRM never intends for Stoneheart to do anything.  The more obvious role the character could play end story speculationg is to completely kill every Frey ending the family line forever.  But I have always expected the Others were most likely to do that with Aryas killers the next mostlikely.  ,gameofthrones,cigvi09,2,t5_2rjz2

1320944,0,t3_2971au,I disagree. A lot of the time you dont know what is foreshadowing until youve seen or read the events that are being foreshadowed. Foreshadowing becomes evident in hindsight. When the event being foreshadowed happens you recall earlier material that foreshadowed it and think yourself a fool for not seeing it coming. I think speculating that something may be foreshadowing an event that hasnt happened yet can be interesting but it can also be pointless. In terms of analysing the show or books I find discussing foreshadowing of events that have already happened much more interesting from a literary perspective. You talk about certain instances of foreshadowing being merely coincidence from a characters perspective because the character who said it had nothing to do with the event they were foreshadowing. But its the writers perspective we are interested in. Foreshadowing is a literary device. If the writers know SEs that Tyrion kills Tywin partly due to pent up anger about Tysha and now Shae and earlier in the series SEs Bronn says hed kill the man who did what Tywin did to Tyrion that could very well be intentional foreshadowing and far from coincidence.,gameofthrones,cii81qi,3,t5_2rjz2

1323624,0,t3_298lrs,I dont think they could be  faithful to the books no matter how hard they tried.  The way the story is presented in the books  from individual characters POV  just cant translate to TV or movies for that matter.  There are other real world amp logistical reasons for changes.  They have said that they have changed some things in order to flesh out a character more based on an actoractress.  I think the biggest problem they are having is in regards to the timeline.  The first two seasons  as has been stated  were fairly faithful to the books.  As they entered ASOS which is the last book I have read this became more of a problem.  They felt as though it was too big a book as far as plot events to cram into one season but not enough for two.  So I think that is why we have ended up with so much filler this past season.  Couple that with some characters story lines being past the third book while others are still have a few things yet to happen and Im not sure what to expect going forward.  The difference I noticed this season after having read ASOS beforehand is that the timeline bothered me the most.  Not to the point where I disliked anything but to where I feel like I wont fully appreciate it until I rewatch it. I was too focused on this is supposed to happen now and this happens later etc..  ,gameofthrones,ciiiwd6,1,t5_2rjz2

To be struck by your HUSBAND must be so humiliating and while arguments can be made that fuck Cersei shes evil and shit her relationship with Robert is such that I can actually understand why she hates him so much. Thats probably not the first time he hit her and it seems like hes done nothing but humiliate her throughout their entire marriage.

Letting one region detach itself would also set a questionable precedent what happens now if another region wants to be on its own again?  What if the Ironborn claim that the Riverlands is theirs since Pyke was sovereign over the Trident before Aegons Conquest?

1352406,0,t1_cill2o1,Im sorry but Tywin is a bitch. All of Tywins obsession with his family just stems from the fact that his father Tytos was weak willed and practically ran the Lannister name into the ground for Tywins stepmothers lavish needs and the coolest thing hes done is strip her of her power and make her walk naked through the streets as soon as his father passed. Why else does everyone fear Tywin though? Because he helped sack Kings Landing? I mean only after the war had pretty much been decided on the Trident with Robert killing Rhaegar did Tywin Lannister even switch sides and by the time the sacking started Ned Starks men were already at the city gates with a ram to bring them down. And then he decided to rape and pillage all of Kings Landing even though the city had already fallen Kings Landing of course being the city he served as Hand of the King to just several years prior. I guess you could consider him cool for destroying all of the heirs of House Reyne when they rebelled with the Tarbecks but taking a family that rebelled against you and killing every one of them so that the line dies is more an example of brutality than clever strategy. It would be like if Robb Stark had decided to kill every member of the Karstark family after Karstark committed treason by killing the two Lannister prisoners. And Robb Stark defeated him in every battle he fought Tywin had to win by convincing a scorned ally to violate guest rights and kill him just to be done with the Young Wolf in fact the only two battles Tywin won were against Roose Boltons small northern host and by showing up late at the Battle of Blackwater and taking Stannis unaware while Tyrion was the one who pretty much held the city. You say Tyrion hasnt done shit but pun intended he managed the sewer system at Casterly Rock for years the only job Tywin would actually permit him to have so you cant really blame him for not having a more active role in court and battles and it ran better than it had in centuries knowledge he sued to hold a whole city while his fatehr showed up late to the gates AGAIN and took the glory. Tywin is a punk who uses his own riches and brutality to inspire fearrespect but none of it is really earned.gt The story about how he paid everyone to fuck Tyrions wife sounds so sketchy as if he overstated what his father actually did.Yeah except he admits to doing this and reveals that Tysha was actually not a whore but a real lowborn girl who actually loved Tyrion. But hes gotta protect that family namestatus of his its way more important than his actual kids.Edit No disrespect meant towards OP. Im very passionate about Tywin being the biggest fraud in the Seven Kingdoms.,gameofthrones,ciltdb1,2,t5_2rjz2

1423882,0,t3_2aenpz,Seriously every single scene that features AlfieTheon. Someone already mentioned the I chose wrong scene and the Rodrik execution somewhat unrelated but the Karstark execution was also excellent but Id also throw in his scene at Moat Cailin and the bit where he yells at Balon You gave me away! Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didnt want anymore. And now you curse me because Ive come home!.On a nonTheon note one that really strikes me is the Khaleesi in the House of the Undying when she repeats Mirri Maz Duurs words to Drogo and Rhaego. ETA I forgot one of my very favorites Jaime and Brienne in the bath.

As the apparent opposite side of magic it would appear that fire magic can alter the nature of death.

1576796,0,t1_cjdx4bv,gt I dunno. Seems like I recapped the first one just fine. Maybe youre having a problem remembering what you said.Im talking about the second. We can work that out fairly logically. I was the one who called your first post a recap. If you had one made post and it was clearly a badly comprehension of the previous post I wouldnt call it a recap.gt And I let you know what animosity he was referring to but since you seemed confused I was recalling what you were referring to. Either way you were being a judgmental doucher but that clearly wasnt out of the ordinary considering how smug youre being now.Theres no confusion on my end I had already told him that it wasnt animosity nor should it have been read as such. He indicated  indirectly admittedly  that I was in some way right as he had not actually been serious answering my fear that I hope lthesgt not serious.I also asked that the worst possible tone not be interpreted. This is me recapping because youve then gone and decided Im being smug when Im being completely matteroffact. Can I also venture that calling me a judgemental doucher is that someone who showers? is probably then the first actual animosity in this little string of comments which previously had been something approaching a grownup argument?,gameofthrones,cjdxelt,1,t5_2rjz2
1577915,0,t3_2caqjb,All of the rapesexual abuse. I hate it so much because it feels like they ruin characters whenever they explicitly add it in. It doesnt make sense. Dany and Drogo on their wedding night was awful. Especially since Drogo becomes so important to Danys character development. Jaime and Cersei. I dunno if the shows writers realised but we are meant to be feeling sympathy for Jaime at this point. Having him commit an assault is just so illogical for story telling. Theon. I dunno I think Ramseys actor is excellent but there are some points where I nope out of those scenes. Personal preference though. Oberyn Martell and the gay Ros. Seriously these background scenes arent establishing anything important. It would be fine and in character for the gay Ros guy to be like yes I am so on board with banging this Prince with the finest ass in the seven kingdoms Basically off the top of my head. I know Sansa gets assaulted too but Im not adding it because its actually important to the story both for Sansa and the Hounds characters and eventually when Hound joins Arya.  ,gameofthrones,cje2i2b,9,t5_2rjz2

Saying that someone should have to look like Emilia Clarke to cosplay Daenerys Targaryen is ridiculous. We may not have book illustrations but we have book descriptions. So going by that anyone with silveryblonde hair lilac eyes and a slim build could play Daenerys and be great at it. The only people who think otherwise are being absolutely ridiculous about it. Emilia Clarke is the best known Dany cosplay because she was hired by the author himself to play her. But she isnt Dany no matter how much you feel she is.

Though I definitely enjoy GOT better then BB because it has more twists throughout the show and has more characters and story lines. Instead of BB were you follow Walter White become a one man drug cartel. So essentially GOT is better because its something completely different and has something for everyone in it The War of Five Kings for people who enjoy battleadventure stuff Arya for a young strong women lead Kings landing for a House of Cards political show and multiple love stories. Also GOT makes you actually nervous for lead characters because the writers arent afraid to kill of anyone. ,gameofthrones,cjne1qr,1,t5_2rjz2

1684169,0,t1_cjrfrmm,hmmm. Thats difficult. Its an important event that directly causes other events to happen but you dont see it happen through a POV so there isnt any buildup or suspense. Its not like Season s Oberyn having his face smashed or Littlefinger pushing Lysa out of the Moon Door. Characters just mention that it happened.My example would be when Robb Stark captured Jaime Lannister during The Battle of the Whispering Wood. You dont witness it firsthand but because of it the Lannister army around Riverrun disintegrates and Tywin Cersei and Tyrion are all affected. The difference between this example and the midlevel spoiler is that in the Jaime example you get to read about the aftereffects almost immediately. However with the midlevel spoiler the aftereffects are not really covered until the start of AFFC.Anyone else have a better example?,gameofthrones,cjrgb1h,6,t5_2rjz2

1724721,0,t1_cjwd4zb,The closest legitimate male relative to Stannis in the show is probably his greatgreat uncle Maester Aemon.AFFC spoilersb Although in the books theres also Stanniss mothers brother Lord Eldon Estermont of Greenstone  theres a contradiction in the book appendices that makes the specific family relations of the Estermonts harder to figure out one of several good reasons they are not in the show these are very minor characters  but the Lannisters and Tyrells capture him or flip him at the Blackwater make him swear fealty to Joffrey and remarry him off to a Dornish noblewoman presumably his wife is dead.AFFCb Tywin takes enough trouble to get the Estermonts into the fold that he probably saw Lord Estermont as a potential future rallying point of the rebellious houses from the Stormlands and the Reach. Its pretty clear that most of them are on the LannisterTyrell side as of the events at the end of Season   if you trace who knows who and look at when Sansa sees the Estermonts and who they are with you can assume they are probably more on the Tyrell side than the Lannister one.AFFCb However Andrew Estermont a nephew on Stanniss mothers side is still with Stannis  in the books hes a former squire of Stannis who helps Davos smuggle out Roberts Bastard so Melisandre cant burn him. If he was going to be in the show you would have seen him in the Gendry boat scene. The Estermonts and the forces of Greenstone that keep supporting Stannis are notable in that they refuse to convert to the worship of Rhllor.AFFCb So yeah Id say Andrew Estermont is one possibility. And he likes Davos so thats nice. Though at that point it would more be keeping the rebellion against the Lannisters alive rather than seeking to put him on the throne personally.AFFCb Oh theres also Lomas Estermont Andrews father Stanniss uncle and the last major Estermont still in rebellion who is one of the dudes Stannis put in charge of Storms End before he attacks Kings Landing. If it came to it you could potentially marry Andrew Estermont to Shireen Baratheon change Andrews name to Baratheon and call him Andrew Baratheon of Storms End  or at Stanniss death you could create House Estermont of Storms End as a cadet house claiming Stannis invested them with it and since the Estermonts of Greenstone support the LannisterTyrells and make Lomas lord of it to raise Andrews station call him Andrew Estermont of Storms End marry him to Shireen have him be queen consort name Lomas as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm and have Shireens children reunify the titles to be Baratheons of Storms End as well as King of the Andals etc. etc. AFFCb Andrews only from a knightly branch of the house not a lordly one so that would be a huge upgrade for him but given the desperate circumstances were guessing at that arrangement I think would be generally seen as legitimate  you know except for the war. Though it would cause problems since neither Andrew nor probably Shireen would want to worship the Lord of Light and it might be smarter to marry Shireen to somebody wealthier or more powerful. Its almost certain none of this would end well.,gameofthrones,cjwkdb4,4,t5_2rjz2

The trick to being successful as an actor is part talent which he absolutely has and part finding the right role where you can thrive.  I think tyrion is one of the best characters on television and he would have had to be incredibly lucky to land such a memorable role.  Just look at how long it took Brian Cranston to be given the right role.    And Matthew mcconaughey while he had a career he wasnt respected until he was given respectable roles,gameofthrones,cka7xkg,6,t5_2rjz2

One chapter youll be inside the mind of a very noble and honorable man then the next chapter you are inside the mind of an incredibly witty and smart man who loves wine and whores and then the next chapter youll be inside the mind of a  year old girl who is enthralled by songs and stories of romance and adventure depicting handsome princes and honorable knights.Heres a sample of a Meereenese Blot essay that I really lovedgt  The human heart in conflict with itself is the only thing worth writing about. George R. R. Martingt Martin has paraphrased this quote from William Faulkner time and time again in interviews yet many readers havent fully internalized it. It means Martin is not interested in merely showing characters leveling up like a video game progressing from incompetent naif to awesome badass. His main interest is in exploring his characters values. And throughout the series he creates drama by forcing characters to choose between their core values  love vs. duty honor vs. pragmatism vows vs. innocent life.The book can do things that the show never can. The show is amazing but it is focused on plot points and loses some of the narrative brilliance that the books have.

2034192,0,t3_2i30i2,At least Shakespeare finishes his books.A great writer is much more than a complex plot. Books  and  make me seriously wonder about the capabilities of GRRM.Shakespeares works are so familiar and commonplace with such a wide influence on later writers that his writing style now seems common and ordinary whereas GRRM is primarily known for twisting and inverting the genre of fantasy. In terms of writing quality Tolkien has GRRM beat hands down even if he had very few female characters  wars at that time didnt involve women and the role of women was largely relegated to the domestic sphere so perhaps understandable and unlike the rape and incest and child sex themes abounding in GRRM books his depiction of the dangers faced by men was way more abstract.Its like claiming the Good Wife is worse than Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad simply because it cant show boobs and rape and incest and beheadings on network TV.

The pen pressure capabilities of the stylus are really hard to do without and work so well on Photoshop. And in terms of building up technique I guess working off photo references is a good way to start because youre sort of unconsciously learning about how light falls on the facehair and how to draw the little details on the face like the waterline of the eye. Having good brushes is also important for building up texture on the skin and saving you time on drawing the hair. This brush pack is the main one I use. Also painting process videos on YouTube are great and specific tutorials like how to paint realistic skin or how to paint realistic eyes because they go into detail about what kind of techniques you can use. ,gameofthrones,cn2s8pv,3,t5_2rjz2

All things considered Joffrey would have been likely to decide that his champion should be an actual lion or that he could have a champion against Ned for each of the seven kingdoms he betrayed and arm him with a wooden training sword.

But the camera starts to shift around a lot after that point and I lost perspective on what areas we were supposed to be focusing on. I know the normal opening has camera cuts but you always know where you are if that makes sense. Still utter genius though. Thanks for sharing this ,gameofthrones,coruthj,3,t5_2rjz2

3192771,0,t3_2wo2je,One thing this argument doesnt address is a valuation of the dozen lives taken versus the . Its tempting to say that one life has just as much value as another but in a civilization with a feudal structure where power resides in individuals thats not completely true. The death of a few dozen lords can have a huge impact on the stability of the region they govern. Its impossible to tell how many more lives will be lost due to infighting crime starvation etc. that comes from resulting power vacuum and the loss of law and order.A similar but more abstract argument could be made regarding the manner of the assassination. Guest Right is a cornerstone of civilized society in this world. Violating it in such a blatant highprofile way does great damage to peoples faith in Guest Right and by extension the societal order in general. As people lose trust in even the most fundamental institutions you move closer to a breakdown of society. If pushed far enough the result is mass distrust and a return to tribalism as people can only rely on their closest friends and family. ,gameofthrones,cosxidy,1,t5_2rjz2

3198375,0,t3_2wravc,Man and Im thorougly negative over here. Im sorry to say this but I believe the show creators are just getting lazy and losing faith in themselves. Of course Im no professional but after the fantastic first few seasons they just dont seem to have that courage of going with lots of characters and settings from the book or keeping the proper dialogue anymore. Sure they have Dorne this season but why skip over the Greyjoys and their fantastic storyline or Lady Stoneheart? I would LOVE to see just the Greyjoy storyline and the events at the wall for this entire season and nothing else but instead we have the story advancing awkwardly and not in line with the books because they have to progress the TV series in some direction. I dont want changes. I want the fantastic material thats in the book to be used and once theyve caught up with the books which is going to happen sooner or later then go their own path and progress as they see fit. Anyways I will still religiously watch every episode of this season. Its just that I wont keep my hopes up like I have for the past few seasons.,gameofthrones,cotieyr,-3,t5_2rjz2

3219276,0,t1_cov968e,I am a book reader and a part of me legitimately hoped they would keep Pascal.  Seeing as how the books storyline only has a couple more years left in it if that the one change in the show that I think many fans would have actually loved would be if they did indeed keep Oberyn.His brother Doran who is getting introduced is a cunning planner Tywinlite but lets not get too obsessed with staying true to the books because Oberyn is also shown as exceedingly smart and close to his brother more than smart enough to carry out the Martell storyline for a few years whether they included Doran or not. Those two are not the kind whose identities and motivations and plans within the story actually change just based upon if one of them dies or not.They are already cutting many Dornish characters. I am not trying to be negative but I wont be surprised if it turns out after Seasons  that the show needed Oberyn for those fans who really need someone strong who they can root for who they actually have a proper amount of time to get invested in  because the show is already halfway over. Someone high up in the character heirarchy with a plan and who can possibly give the viewers a show and have it be  satisfying every now and then.And what better way would there have been for Game of Thrones to pull a Game of Thrones move than to finally not feature a disappointing death?,gameofthrones,covohzb,3,t5_2rjz2

The TV version had that aspect mostly stripped away but its so core to his role in the story that you cant remove it entirely without removing the character.Thats why I dont take the Stannis is a murderer stuff seriously.

3472109,0,t1_cpnz5fa,I agree. I think the conflict between LF and Varys will come to a head if at any point LF makes a play for the throne Varys will then have to act as he has clearly backed Dany. You brought up the point of LF and Sansa which obviously cannot be denied due to the foreshadowing the writers allude throughout some of season  and more in your face in . Its heavily suggested he is replacing her for Cat and also views her as the ticket to the next step but does he see her a a piece of hot Tully stock or as a child he has cared and loved. I personally believe he wont do anything to hurt Sansa if anything hell take her with him to the top.Heres the question I have that has not been answered so far in the show or books or at least I missed it is there any law disscussed in regards to succession of titles and land for men and women? does the male heir take precedent no matter the age?

But to your point similarly we also hear different characters work or influence invoked here and there. Recalling how the Lord of Light is invoked when Varys is opening the crate in his quarters in front of Tyrion.

3489738,0,t1_cppyd38,But see these responses are all prime examples of what Im talking about.. I agree wholeheartedly that Aidan Gillen is EXCELLENT as Littlefinger but why not list his offenses as well? An entire paragraph saying why Jorah is a horrible man but not Petyr because OH ITS OKAY CAUSE HES FUN TO WATCH. Why is it only Lord Friendzone is seen as the creepy old man crushing on a young girl?To me Petyr is much worse. So he fell in love with Cat and even tried to duel for her hand understandable. So he still loves her also understandable. But hes projecting those feelings onto Sansa and even tells her at one point that he sees her as the daughter he could have had and later proceeds to KISS HER. I have never once seen any uncreepy person refer to someone as their child and then kiss them.. This is the same girl whose father he betrayed which led to Ol Dead Neds fate.In all honesty if GoT fans and I dont mean you fellow Redditor truly believe that Jorah is worse then Id rather stick with Tyrion as my favorite character lol.,gameofthrones,cpq1zrn,2,t5_2rjz2

Dying her hair and spending a little times with Littlefinger wouldnt make her suddenly do a  and become what is essentially everything opposite of who Sansa is. There is a huge drastic event that accounts for why LSH is who who they are. Nothing like this would happen to Sansa to justify the abrupt change.Im guessing your using the Littlefinger line from the trailer Avenge them to support this idea?

We dont know how far north the Lands of Always Winter stretch nor do we know how far south Sothoryos goes nor do we know how far east the Shadow Lands reach.

3622123,1,t3_31r86l,For everyone that is pissed it is exclusive to Apple TV for  months let me remind you that there were ZERO options outside of cable last season and every season before it. Most of you would pirate anyways because lt. HBO isnt forcing anyone to do anything especially not pirate in fact theyve made more options available yet this has made some people even angrier.The reason Apple wants to force you do sign up with iOS? Because it would defeat almost the entire purpose of Apple paying whatever boatload of money they must have payed in order to make it temporarily exclusive. Apple wants you to buy the Apple TV not borrow your friends iMac for  minutes and then play it on your PC. If they allowed you to do it that way they all deserve to be fired immediately for incompetence. There are a few workarounds if anyone was interested. First buy an Apple TV. This solution involves money so thats probably out of the question for most of you that get Game of Thrones for free. Second find someone with an apple product and get them to buy HBO Now and then use their sub to log in you can even login on a PC. This also involves money so its probably out of the question as well. The third option is to keep pirating and use mental gymnastics to convince yourself that you are not a bad person and instead are being forced to do it by evil corporations. ,gameofthrones,cq55cyp,1,t5_2rjz2

3687857,0,t1_cqcmiln,The thing for Mance is him bending the knee to Stannis and putting his people into servitude would betray everything the Free Folk stand for. Ignoring what transpired in the books and taking the shows universe as its own entity the actions of Mance make perfect sense in regards to how the Wildlings view bending the knee or serving a Southron Lord.If Mance bends the knee he in effect sentences his people to fight and die for a Southron Lord who only wants their help because its convenient. Stannis doesnt see the Free Folk as refugees who need saving from the terrible fate that will come for all. He sees them as pawns to be used and sacrificed in the game of thrones. Mance probably knows this coming from the Nights Watch. Therefore even if the deal sounds good from a practical standpoint Mance cannot make the deal because to do so would be to sentence his people the people who raised him up as their leader to a life of servitude of lords and kings.That is not the way of the Free Folk. ,gameofthrones,cqcn289,4,t5_2rjz2

3696666,0,t1_cqdlttu,The pieces may be different but the beats are the same. What youre talking about is repainting the deck chairs on the Titanic. It doesnt matter what color skin they are or if they were abused or mutilated. What would matter is if this impacted the storytelling somehow and so far it hasnt. Mostly because Dany refuses to treat Grey Worm as a slave or as a eunuch or whatnot.The worlds stigma against the eunuch is delved into much more thoroughly by Varys.A very related story I think is Forrest Gump which is about the love between an abused girl and a retarded boy. But the story wasnt about that so much as it was about Forrest proving to the world that he has something to offer and that his mental handicap doesnt mean hes not capable of love and friendship.,gameofthrones,cqdn7rp,1,t5_2rjz2

3741755,0,t1_cqiqv6y,There are at least . Cerseis Myrcellas and Sansas. We dont know which of the two younger girls necklace was sent with the snake or who sent it. As Doran Martell wouldnt condone threatening the life of Myrcella if that was actually her necklace it was sent secretly by either Ellaria or one of the sand snakes. If it was Sansas any number of people could have sent it most likely either Baelish or Cersei herself.That is assuming the writers remember that Sansa had one too. This is a plot that never happened in the books but it would be quite interesting if they are using such obscure details from previous seasons for major story lines now.Edit ucy pointed out that Ros received one from Tyrion back in season  and Cersei found it and incorrectly deduced that she was Tyrions secret whore from having the necklace. So there are at least  and Cersei for sure was aware of at least . Both Cersei and Baelish would have had an opportunity to acquire either Sansas or Ross necklace at some point. Maybe she forgot the other  maybe she is lying to create a reason to get Myrcella back and get rid of Jaime for a minute maybe Baelish is just stirring shit up for the lulz and to increase his own power somehow.

House Lannister has always been one of the greatest and most powerful houses in Westeros. Tywin was very prideful of his House his family not so much. Tywins father Tytos made House Lannister look foolish and weak. Because of this House Reyne challenged their power and it was Tywin who put them to the sword. OK Tyrion makes bad choices. I said it. He killed his mother by being born that wasnt his fault. Hes a dwarf thats not his fault. He is however a drunk and a whoremonger he gambles his fathers money and associates with a lower class of people. Hes basically that bad cousinuncle every family has. To make matters worse he is more perceptive and intelligent than his siblings. Because of this Tywin sees him as wasted potential and a threat to  the pride of House Lannister. And of course Jamie and Cersei are just ungrateful vain and conceited. Tywin pretty much has the worst children.,gameofthrones,cr0dy1g,3,t5_2rjz2

There also exists lunisolar calendars which mix the two by adding extra days to a lunar calendar to bring it in line with a solar calendar. As it turns out on our planet  lunar cycles lines up fairly close with a solar year somewhere along the way for the Gregorian calendar specifically people made decisions to add days to the lunar calendars moving them from a lunar to lunisolar  which is essentially what we use albeit the connection to the lunar aspect is less pronounced because of the changes.tldr  our calendar system started as based on the moon cycles.We associated  lunar cycles to a year because of a number of aspects of our worlds the seasons were just one of them. Theres any number of things in Westeros that could happen annually  cosmic phenomena tidal patterns current patterns etc.  that could be used to mark a regular cycle. In time they associate a number of lunar cycles to the space in between and you have a year.

Before I start citing that stuff whats your criteria for credible and whats your qualification for judging it?  I have an actual not metaphorical Ph.D. in this field.  Im not trying to argue from authority Im saying that Im well read on the subject. FWIW Im not that big on media effects in general and there are specific instances e.g. gaming where I think most of the published research is...not good.  But other types of longitudinal effects research is fairly well established.gttime and time again the exact opposite has been shown. This makes me suspect you dont know what youre talking about.  While the field of media effects is controversial and enormously complicated the exact opposite has almost certainly not been demonstrated certainly not time and again.gtBad representation how? The slavers were the bad ones not the ones shouting Mhysa. Sorry should have been more clear.  Bad as in a representation that inculcates or perpetuates racial disparities through stereotypetrope.  Bad as in we are poor brown wretches who are prostrating ourselves to our white savior.  At least that is one possible interpretation.  I think its a valid interpretation because precisely that type of scene with that intended message has been portrayed in Western media of various kinds for most of the last two centuries.For the record Im a bit on the fence with this reading of the scene.  But I certainly think that reading the scene in that way is entirely credible and to that end some of the criticism of GOT along these lines may be warranted.  Certainly you can say that you dont think the scene rises to this level but so far you want to dismiss it out of hand suggesting that people are looking to be offended.

4005281,0,t1_crcsm9z,From her perspective in the show I dont think she really understood just the level of fucked up that Ramsey is. Jeoffrey wore his crazyness on his sleeves but Ramsey has done things in poor taste. Up to the rape scene she had an idea that he may not be on the level but that it was his father she should be scared of. After all she was being protected by Baelish who emphasized it by telling her that Ramsey was under her finger and that Roose was the real threat.People keep saying that the scene is gratuitous and that it doesnt drive anything forward for the audience because it just reinforces that Ramsey is a psycho Sansa regresses to a passive bystander in her own story and Theon pees himself. But really all the characters are learning something. Sansa is learning just how deeply screwed her situation is. Ramsey learns that he has a new play thing to torment and Theon learns how much he actually cares for Sansa which is arguably one of the most important plot points. All  characters relationships shift in this scene and in a show that is driven by character relations and alliances that is the most important thing a scene can do.,gameofthrones,crctzlc,8,t5_2rjz2

Each Stark has a destiny to separately become very exceptional in their pursuits.  They each become the best at what they do some even doing things that no one has ever done in the world before.  The direwolves names and for some their actions are clues to the Starks fates.For example Direwolf foreshadowing for Robb with Grey Wind spoilers through SASOSg Grey is the color of death in ASOIAF many references and wind is a fleeting thing that blows strong but fades.

She went from being abused by another character to being saved by another character to bad hit from other characters to being saved... now with it being Sansa in the north shes just back to being abused by another character.

4015083,0,t3_36h19b,I have a theory about the reason people like Ramsay more than Geoffrey.  Geoffrey is a more disagreeable character by todays standards because he was able to torture people on the basis of his privilege and status while Ramsay lives in a more dismal kingdom and is a bastard that had to work his way up.  In todays social climate in the west we tend to admire people who have to earn their status rather than people who are granted it through legacy wealth.  Ramsay however is far worse than Geoffrey though.  If I had to choose to be executed by Geoffrey or be locked in a torture room with Ramsay I would choose execution by Geoffrey.  In the former case I would have my head cut off or some torture which might last a half an hour in the latter case I could live for months or even years enduring epic psychological and physical torture.No Ramsay is far worse and there is no contest.  And dont take this the wrong way but I find it a little disturbing that so many people are so chill with Ramsay and make excuses for this characters all the time.  It should be unquestionable that this character is a depraved subhuman who deserves nothing short of spending eternity experiencing the suffering he has caused others.  Sadly this probably wont happen!  He will probably get shot with an arrow or something and die quickly.,gameofthrones,crdy7bl,1,t5_2rjz2

She married him for power to get back into a high position in Winterfell and this was the plan by Littlefinger that she agreed to.  Once they overthrow the Boltons then she will be in  position in Winterfell.  This was the plan all along.  It has to be a convincing performance that she wanted this marriage she knew this was coming and kind of bit the bullet that it was a necessary evil she had to go through.  Sansa also knew Ramsay Bolten was a sadist killer of many womenpeople torturer Reek so this was pretty much expected to happen.  I dont see how knowing his character this is surprising.

He undid his breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart. One hand slid up her thigh and underneath her smallclothes. When he tore them away he saw that her moons blood was on her but it made no difference. She clearly did not want to have sex and resisted but Jaime forced his way on top of her anyways. Thats rape.,gameofthrones,crfm37h,-4,t5_2rjz2

4030075,0,t1_crfgs0k,gt and believe that the point of view youre explaining is analogous to a problematic one that is widely held by a lot of people nowadays.Just to be clear I view the world of GoT as vastly different from ours. A fantasy world with other rules. In real life we havent been inside of the head of the characters. Like reading the books. And so we shouldnt speculate as much as Ive been doing here but rather stick to the facts we know and what can be proven.         To make it even more clear I do not hold the opinion that a married man can force his wife to have sex. That would be rape.        I think my opinions about what is rape is on par with the opinions of most decent people. But back to the scene. Maybe it was rape maybe youre right.  It looked very rapeish.        What bothers me more is the fact that people react so much to it.          Some people will always be offended no matter what so I dont think the guys who makes the series can bother about it. Its a reason it is on HBO after all and people can avoid it if they want to. And even if they would censor themselves with regards to rape victims they should probably do the same with regards to victims of war and so the snowball starts rolling.. So anyways thats it for tonight. Thanks for being someone who can actually talk about a touchy subject like this like an adult even though we have conflicting views.

In the books he storms dragonstone so that the fleet can be used to help defend tyrell land against the iron born because cersei was not going to let them leave until that situation was settled. Stannis was already known to be in the north then and as such there was zero chance for him to get revenge out of the battle. He was just trying to get it done as quickly as possible.  ,gameofthrones,crgf717,1,t5_2rjz2
4036792,0,t1_crg9loy,Thats the problem that a lot of people have with the scene though. They took Sansas rape and used it to focus on Theon. Sansa was gaining her own power and agency and they took it from her for the purpose of another character. The show has always been weird when it comes to women and rape and they usually never show the aftereffects of it. People rightfully so are worried that the show will not show how the rape affects Sansa but Theon.,gameofthrones,crgfavi,3,t5_2rjz2
4036797,1,t1_crg71pn,Its not just people saying this is outside my comfort zone Im going to stop watching.  Its people denouncing the writers or describing the scene as problematic the same people who never said a word about all the other acts of horrific violence.  This annoys many fans including myself.Was it problematic for Theon to be tortured for a full season and have is dick cut off?  No?  Then why is Sansas offscreen rape problematic?  We all know the answer  gender politics.,gameofthrones,crgfbm6,0,t5_2rjz2
4036818,0,t1_crgd7ta,gtBecause by showing the effect on him instead of Sansa its implying that he was the main victim.Strongly disagree. A reasonable viewer knows that Sansa is the real victim and that Theons emotions are a reaction to the far greater pain she is suffering.More importantly keeping her and her reaction to this act off screen until the next episode denies catharsis to the viewer. If the camera zooms in on Sansas face showing some steely resolve we all get to feel slightly better knowing that shes going to use this atrocity to fuel her revenge. Thats something positive for the viewer to latch onto. Denying us that perspective makes the whole situation even more horrible. Given Sansas arc she probably will get the upper hand but for now thats uncertain and we have to fill in the details with our imagination. Denying resolution is a great way to ramp up the tension.,gameofthrones,crgfepu,14,t5_2rjz2
4036900,0,t1_crg9knl,What was the duress? She describes how he touched her gently and after that he asked her No? That implies he wouldve stopped if she continued to refuse. He wasnt holding her down she wasnt fighting him off. And lets not forget that they have no common language to discuss what theyre doing. Im just really unclear what the duress is here unless you mean the general expectation that a wife will have sex with her husband on their wedding night. In this universe there is no reason that Drogo wouldnt see that as Danys duty as his wife. ,gameofthrones,crgfqtw,1,t5_2rjz2

In the books Tommen looks up to Loras a great deal at this point and admires his fighting ability.

4037340,0,t1_crgfsqf,You make a good point that its not really the writers responsibility to handle it sensitively. They can and should do what they want. But its perfectly reasonable for people to stop watching if they dont handle it sensitively or to complain that they havent handled it well.Maybe follow up isnt necessary but Game of Thrones is gritty and realistic in other ways. People hold grudges actions have consequences heroes dont always survive. I think including real emotions would be good for the show. Many of the characters have been feeling hollowed out lately which to be fair is one of the difficulties the show has to deal with since they dont have a lot of time to go in depth. Im honestly not sure how theyre going to handle the aftermath of this in the show. I really want to see it be interesting and valid and I think the only way they can do that now is going into Sansas emotions and mindset which would include her immediate recovery.

4041071,0,t1_crgv56n,Thats fair as well but I personally disagree that its not bad writing for them to do that. DampD these days seem to be going with things that will cause the most drama and upset when they change things from the bookswrite their own stuff regardless of whether its something thats expected from the character. Barristan should not have died the way he did. Grey Worm and the unsullied should not have fought the way they did. Jaime shouldnt have pretty much raped Cersei though for this one I will accept that its possible that it was bad directing and not bad writing. Theres just so much that theyre having characters do despite showing said characters in completely different lights in earlier seasons. Thats what I dont like.Everyone acts like its that bad because to them it is. Honestly the Sand snake scenes to me are so bad I almost dont even want to watch them I only do because I know the storyline will end up important to Jaimes and hes my favourite. But its not even the storyline itself its that literally everything about it is bad to me. The writing is terrible their motive is terrible the fight scene was terrible the way the actresses deliver their lines is terrible goes back to writing but still. I respect that you dont think its that bad but that doesnt mean that it isnt to some other people. Its becoming increasingly obvious to myself and others that the time constraints they had in regards to shooting at the Water Gardens location has made the Dorne story seem very rushed and not well put together so far at all. That theyve only had  scenes to develop doesnt mean much to me because first impressions are huge. Instead of them wowing me with the first  scenes they made me completely hate the characters and now theyve got to spend whatever time they have now winning me back.,gameofthrones,crgwv96,1,t5_2rjz2

However to say this season is perfect would be a lie. Theyve done a poor job moving the plot along theres plot holes littered about the kings landing plot when I almost cant remember one plot hole from previous seasons and dorne is an absolute mess. Ill try to address this with  major points.. Dorne  Oberyn was a huge hit and I think theyre trying to milk the success of him. They have this big elaborate setting and were only given  week to film all the scenes there including that mess of a fight last week. The  sandsnakes are a terrible combination of the power rangersninja turtles. The fact that they both showed up at Myrcella  seconds apart is ridiculous as is the fact that Bronns cut on his arm is the only wound from the fight. Bitch had a whip for fucks sake and BronnJamie grabbed it at one point. Pull her ass into your steel blade and toss her in the garden whats with all the dancing? Absurd. My next problem comes with the unnecessary duos we get. I could certainly be wrong but BriennePod and Grey WormMissiendiSp? get way too much screen time for how little affect they have on the major plot. Brienne is just like a pathetic loser to me now. You let the  people you were protecting die swore by this oath to find the stark girls found them and they both told you to get fucked and now youre just like there. Enough she was a cool character but frankly the Hound shouldve murdered her and then still been wounded and had the Arya scene where she leaves him.. Last the characters we care most about are doing NOTHING. Tyrion has literally just been traveling the whole time with a  minute stoneman fight in the middle. He started the season on the run from kings landing to Dany and hes still doing exactly that. Dany started the season with her city in turmoil and everyone hating her and thats exactly the situation still. Her marriage was the biggest meh event of the season. Like who cares I dont think her husband will ever be a major player in Westeros nor will he help her get there. Jon snow started the season and became lord commander kind of a big deal but it hasnt really affected the plot because he was still the one going solo to talk to the wildlings and thats literally what hes going back to do now! I know things have happened but becoming Lord Commander when youre basically doing whatever you want anyway wasnt that big of a deal to me. Getting married to appease some slaves in a city you plan on leaving isnt that big of a deal to me. Tyrions has had no redeeming qualities outside of Peter Dinklage being the man and doing an awesome job with not that much to work with.Theres  episodes left and I want some plot development. By the end of this season Dany either needs to give up or this shit has to be peaceful. Im sure Tyrion will get there and things will get spiced up but I dont want another season of civil unrest its not entertaining. Stannis needs to attack Winterfell and Im fairly sure Ill get that. Last I really need a whitewalker event. A big one. They need to invade wherever SnowTormund are going and that can convince the wildlings to move south. At this point Im forgetting that theyre even the main source of fear in this story. Regardless Ill love it either way. Id be lying if I said I wasnt a bit disappointed in what Ive gotten so far but in my mind its taken the show from like a  to a . ,gameofthrones,crhntjc,12,t5_2rjz2

4067447,0,t3_375p8n,This is an interesting theory.If you were to have a twist for the end of Danys season it would be this. Most people seem to be expecting Hizdahr as the man behind the harpy attacks.If it is Daario then there would need to be a good reason why he betrayed Dany especially when he is in such a good position. And if he was to be the backstabber than that may be a push towards making the Dany and Hizdahr bond stronger.  It would certainly help her claim of the region. You add Tyrion and maybe some obedient dragons to all this and you got Dany back in business to conquer Westeros. But this is just one potential path down the story. The good thing about Daenerys story right now is that it can go in alot of different directions.. But I guess the one common element is Tyrion helping her towards an eventual Westeros visit so I dont think many people will see that part of the story go away. ,gameofthrones,crjx1d6,13,t5_2rjz2

4084523,0,t1_crkga9d,Thats funny what you said about Dorne lol. I had the same thoughts. I was wondering why the patrol was there but just assumed there was an explanation about what they were doing there in the books. And then when the Sand Snakes and Jaime amp Bronn get to where Myrcella is all at the same time that was just too much. I literally LOLed.  Hopefully the whole DorneSand Snakes thing will get better right now its just so weird. Why are the Sand Snakes with Bronn in a dungeon but Jaime is hanging out in a fancy suite? Books  amp b Thats interesting about Jaimes story and how he realizes he is more like Brienne. When Jaime and Bronn passed Tarth in the show the look on Jaimes face well he was obviously thinking about Brienne. I wonder if that is the extent of Jaimes realization that he is indeed more like Brienne? I do hope the Sand Snakes stuff gets better. It was very hyped up and so far I have been disappointed. I didnt even realize at first that one of the Sand Snakes mother was Oberyns girlfriend from last season I guess because her hair is different? I was like who is this person? But that stuff happens when you havent read the books there are so many characters it gets confusing.Sansas story yeah. One thing I thought was interesting after GRRM released an excerpt of Book b not sure if you read that  the chapter was titled Alayne and I skimmed through it bc I didnt want to be spoiled on anything too big but I did recognize the name Alayne as Sansas fake name for like one episode on the show. In the chapter she talks about getting married again but worries that she cant get married because shes still legally married to the imp or something along those lines.

4097852,0,t3_37k2p4,I suppose if Tommen and Myrcella die then it would go to the oldest Baratheon since Roberts kids all died. but seeing as Stannis is already at war with the Crown i dont see that happening. i would think that cersie would attempt to hold onto the throne by any means necessary and either claim it for herself good luck with that or her Uncle Kevin would take the throne. which wouldnt make sense since he is not in the line of succession at all. but then again Cersie is only using the Baratheon name as her kids right to rule. take that away and they would most likely take the throne for the Lannisters in name as well. since all the remaining Baratheons are either dead. or already at war with the crown currently.

The Valar forbade them to use force to dominate or compel Elves and Men which is part of the reason that they dont appear to be particularly powerful but Sauron is also a Maia though a particularly powerful one.

4109883,0,t1_cropeaj,gtIt makes no sens for many reasons. gtFirst Littlefinger has no reason to make Gendry king. Its now fairly obvious he doesnt want to rule trough someone but have the Iron Throne for himself. Making Gendry the new king does nothing to further this cause. I think Littlefinger would be happy to rule through a proxy. Joffrey was King Tywin was Hand who was the real boss? Tommen is King and everyone is bossing that guy around. gtSame for Olenna Margery is Queen with complete control over the King why would she undermine Tommens claim ? She doesnt want to get out of King Landing like you said thats a complete assumption on your part. Well considering that she constantly complains about Kings Landing I did kind of just assume. Margaery is the one with all of the ambition. She doesnt just want to be a Queen she wants to be the Queen. But now her Mother of Madness mother in law has had her imprisoned along with her brother. Thats after threatening to have her throat cut a few times already. The Lord of their house Mace has been nothing but a sycophant to Cersei and now hes been sent off to The Iron Bank where he very well may be killed by Meryn Trant on her order. Maybe its time for Margaery to cut her losses and go home. gtAlso you assume Cersei is going to get condamned and Tommen removed from the throne but how exactly is the High Sparrow going to prove the incest between Cersei and Jaime ? Making love between cousins is widely accepted in Westeros and even that is hard to prove unless Cersei also has a conveniently placed birth mark as well ? But that would be... boring. If anything Cersei is going to be prosecuted for the murder of Robert which once again its going to be really hard to prove she did anything spiking someones else wine isnt really murder and Robert was a notorious alcoholic anyway. All in all I am sorry but that doesnt make sens for Gendry to be the gift. It would be proven to the High Sparrow by the Tyrellsand unbeknownst to him Littlefinger in the same way that it would have been proven to King Robert by Jon Aryn. Black of hairBlack of hairBlack of hairRobert Baratheon black of hairJoffrey Baratheon golden haired. Im sure they dont factor in plausible deniability in Westeros. Lol. As far as Roberts murder goes the proof is Lancel as witness and coconspirator. If they planned it it was murder.gtOlyvar makes more sens it would allow Olenna to clean her grand children of all charges while letting Cersei rot in prison effectively letting the Tyrell in control of the Iron Throne and in debt to Littlefinger.Its too late for Olyvar to clear the charges. He already testified. ,gameofthrones,cror2qb,5,t5_2rjz2

4143324,0,t3_385x9q,. Old Valyria was destroyed by a series of volcanic eruptions which is referred to as the Doom of Valyria. This happened roughly  years before Aegon the Conqueror took over Westeros which was about  years before where we currently are in the show.. Greyscale is contagious to touch as you said but I dont believe it makes anyone go crazy. The infected that attacked Jorah and Tyrion while going through Valyria were sent there to live out their lives in solitude away from everyone else. Stannis daughter had greyscale but Stannis had the best Maesters and healers from around the world to stop the spreading of the disease. They arent sure exactly what or how they stopped it but they did.. That wasnt an avalanche it was basically a snow storm. With the storm came the White Walkers and their wights. Wights are basically the zombies that the White Walkers control. The wildings didnt all of a sudden look like they were dead for years those were wights.

Ned Stark is Honorable Tywin is a Strategist Tyrion is Witty Littlefinger is Cunning Brienne is Loyal Ramsay is Mad Cersei is Manipulative Hodor is Hodor etc.An Honorable man either broke his vows and slept with Jons mother or allowed his wife to be dishonored by lying all these years and tarnishing their vows anyway. We give him the benefit of the doubt because otherwise he seems so upstanding but he does have failings.Id have to agree though that Tywin could be fairly decent strategist though with only Robb kicking his ass hard to explain. At war Tywin should have dominated but it might be understandable given the conditions. Tywin might have been god at pitched battles but struggled to cope with guerrilla tactics British army versus Virginian hunters during Revolution. Who would have pictured Ice Zombies being a real threat? Magic doesnt have a huge presence in Westeros outside of the idea of dragons so itd be like me proving zombies really exist by showing someone an elephant. Daenarys and her army is also hard to believe would go so big so fast. She came from nothing to huge Tywin was probably thinking they needed to get home in order first then when a small force shed muster got to the Seven Kingdoms he could point out a common enemy and unify the lands more strongly.

4152825,0,t1_crtmgmz,Cocky yes he didnt see Sam as a threat but thats not a taunt. Maybe its just a matter of interpretation but I dont consider humiliating someone the same as a taunting action. To me a taunt is a type of humiliation yes but one that tries to provoke a reaction from the opposing side.I went to rewatch the clips where Sam encounters the white walkers one of the lieutenants looks at him sees him in his pitiful quivering state and orders his troops to keep marching. If you want to attribute any emotion to that gesture Id consider it either mercy or disinterest.When Sam destroys the white walker he doesnt stand in front of Sam waiting for him to strike or pull out a weapon he just walks towards the baby destroys Sams weapon and throws him aside in the process as he poses no threat at that point. He had no idea that such a weak creature like Sam would be in possession of a magical dagger capable of killing him in a single blow.So yes we can deduct that they can be arrogant and underestimate their opponents which in both encounters weve seen in the series with main characters have lead to their demise. But if the intention of the final scene was to give a sense of hopelessness and dread it would have been far more effective in my opinion if the Night King just stood near the edge of the water on his horse staring at Jon as the slain wildlings rose behind him and stared back as well. The gesture was needless.,gameofthrones,crtmwcf,1,t5_2rjz2

4158173,0,t3_38assg,In the books it was never revealed whether the wights were a force of nature with no real motivation or intellectual beings. In the show the latter has definitely been confirmed. This coupled with Old Nans stories of the others and the children of the forest I personally think they used to be there before man ever came to westeros and fought for the territory. Eventually man and the CoF pushed back the others to their land of winter and Bran the Builder put up the wall. Any men who fought the others but got left behind eventually led to the wildlings and lived behind enemy lines with other beasts. After centuries of waiting and regaining their strength the others now wish to reclaim the land beyond the wall especially now that the CoF are gone.,gameofthrones,cru8ra5,3,t5_2rjz2

Also the books and the show heavily favour the common tropes of fantasy and society selectively men hold the physical power while women hold the metaphysical power with the exceptions that prove the rule. Brienne Bran Arya there are the outliers such as the sand snakes but all those daughters are bastard born and the Maesters are a religious order.So its very likely that the women of that particular group by and large follow the same trope. ,gameofthrones,cruapoj,1,t5_2rjz2

4195156,0,t1_cryee7f,Im a huge Tolkien fan as well but I think you need to watch Game of Thrones without Tolkien as your reference point. GRRM said it himself Tolkien was the first author who had made him feel like anyone could die at any point. First Gandalf is cast down it appears fighting the Balrog then chapters later Boromir is killed. It all happened very fast for him and I think it made him want to write a story where the people you love can die. In fact they most likely will. But aside from that the world of Westeros is RUTHLESS. To an even further extent the Middle Earth in a lot of ways. Nature and Weather were a threat in Middle Earth but are even more of a driving factor in AGOT. From religion to war they inform a lot of decisions the houses make. People die people scheme and you should not feel good afterwards. You should be pissed off. But hey dont say that there is something inherently wrong with the way the author decided to write the story. If you can not see the larger implications of all of the death then the show just isnt for you. Its not story telling that adheres to rewarding the characters with the most honorable intention. You will root for those who will lose and it will suck but there are plenty of rewards in the show. But Ill say this if you arent enjoying it and cant by the end of season  perhaps you should just read the books and avoid the show. Maybe it would create more of a connect for you  ,gameofthrones,cryg16d,2,t5_2rjz2

He has been single mindedly determined to get the Iron Thrones since the start. Thats all he ever talks about.. We can talk about how touching that scene was with his daughter earlier but regardless there were  and a half seasons of ignoring her. You omit that one scene and I forget Stannis even talks to Shireen when there were  dozen scenes of him talking about the throne.Yeah this is fucked up and I dont like him for it but hes not a good guy.

4201223,0,t1_crz42mt,Yeah I agree.  Hes aging and sick which I think is hinted at in this episode with how much difficulty he has in the pits.  Brienne is at the height of her strength and I think we forget that she truly is one of the best sword fighters we have seen on the show.  When Jamie was alive she was almost? its somewhat unclear his match.  She beats the Hound in an incredibly brutal fashion.  She wins Renlys tournament against Loras a known excellent swordsman and she does it with apparent ease.  There are a few other really strong swordsmen in the book like Lorass brother and Robert Strong but so far we havent seen them in the show.  Theres also Bronn but who knows about him.  Dorne is supposed to be home to many great warriors but the Sandsnakes our only examples have failed to uphold this reputation so far.  Uh Jon Snow is also an excellent fighter but that hasnt been seen in quite a while and Im not sure how much hes really excellent or if hed just way better than the band of misfits at the wall because of his formal training.,gameofthrones,crz4rja,30,t5_2rjz2

4203509,0,t1_crz32ky,Gout is a form of arthritis. It will flare up periodically and is generally tied closely to ones diet.  Its caused by the buildup of uric acid in the joints causing inflammation swelling and increased sensitivity.  Its extremely painful.  During a bad attack my feetknees will swell up until it looks like the skin will burst.  The area is hot to the touch and putting even the slightest pressure on it is agony.  I cant even bear the weight of a sheet.  If Im forced to walk on it it feels like walking on a badly broken bone the edges grinding together.    I have a hereditary form where my body overproduces uric acid some missing enzyme or something.  It sucks but thankfully there are medications now that will help control it and limit outbreaks.

Light cavalry who neglected to flank them and charged directly into the phalanx. Just like in the show we hear a lot about them but they ever actually do anything that warrants this bizarre supersoldier archtype that people have attributed to them. The books even say that they get soft when on guard duty which is exactly what theyve been doing. Its actually funny that  is used here because the  Spartans are great example of this.

4204347,0,t1_crzb1kh,Thats also not true.A short punch may have follow through but at some point it stops being a punch and starts being a push. Furthermore. They both allow the same amount of force generated. Both punches will move the same distance but one punch will end with more speed. The shorter punch moving the opponents head with a lot of follow through has more mass as the head and hand are essentially a connected system. You use your quads and glutes for literally every punch not just an uppercut. An uppercut starts to lose speed as you pass mid extension. This is why its most powerful there. A punch delivers force to its target when it causes its target to move. The more acceleration it causes the more force it had delivered. Wi th a short punch the hand isnt moving very fast. Say it connects at  miles hour. Once it connects to the head it slows down significantly. At this point if you follow through youre delivering speed but at a much slower rate. Wi th a longer punch the hand is moving much faster. Say  miles hour. Obviously it has more energy it can deliver to the head. The strongest punch lands not at full extension but when its nearly there. In This way it has both speed and follow through.Take the example to the extreme. If a punch started with the fist already touching the head would the punch hurt? No you would essentially be pushing the head. It doesnt matter how far you push their head. It doesnt matter how far their head goes after you punch it. The only thing that matters is how much acceleration their head experiences. This is achieved with a punch that travels as fast as powerful while still allowing for follow through at the end.,gameofthrones,crzhhrz,-2,t5_2rjz2

4226991,0,t1_cs20txd,The series isnt over. So well see how this fantasy world with magic that only comes from kings blood develops. If it was just to shock us all then maybe it jumped the shark. But the last time someone burned kids it was used to justify him being tortured having his member cut off and becoming a wholly different person.Until last night Stannis was someone we rooted for within the plot. Apparently GRRM told the show writers that this was part of the story. The show has also set this up for a while. Melisandre and Selyse have both hinted at it. Im betting there is a point to all of it. most obviously will be what magic this act provides Stannis. In happy days Fonzi had previously said hed never perform stunts like that. It was against his character. In GoT Stannis has been on a path towards do anything necessary because I am destined to be king. Stannis has also been a firm believer in Rhollor and burning people alive. I will now be happy when Stannis fails. The plot development has also now pitted two villains against each other in the battle of winterfell. That adds something to the plot.So I disagree that there is no plot development here. The burning of a girl is horrible and that was the point. The scene was memorable for a reasonYour personal barometer for what youll accept in a tv show that is full of death torture rape and magic does not accurately measure whether it has jumped the shark or not. For example my mother would have been upset by season  episode  and never been able to watch the show again. Does that mean it jumped the shark?,gameofthrones,cs21xoi,2,t5_2rjz2

There are a couple of mentions in reddit threads but thats about it.  Even then the authors say its really unlikely.  Basically its a couple of flings with a farmers wife and being called a kinslayer most likely because people believe he killed Bran and Rickon...his adoptive family members.  Come on.

Castration was a way of trading individual power and tenacity for singleminded obedience see Theon.The type of motivations you describe are strong but their way of life didnt prepare them for that sort of violence. They were individually hobbled in order to allow a collective strength and now that strength is gone.Could they be great fighters again?

I dont like that he has no mercy or sympathy for people who dont agree with him or who arent like him. You know who else was like that? YOU KNOW WHO ELSE.He accepts as fact ridiculous doctrines because he manages to filter them through his rigid code of honor which is really just I AM OWED THINGS AND THEY BELONG TO ME AND I WILL TAKE THEM EVEN IF I BREAK THEM IN THE PROCESS.Boooooooo Stannis.

4249579,0,t1_cs4llwf,Starks havent considered themselves Kings for  years. Just because Melisandre stresses kings blood doesnt mean that any blood of anyone that is relation to someone that was once king or claims to be king is of use. Every kingdom has a noble family that had a ruler that claimed himself king of that region before Aegon. Only two families have proclaimed themselves Kings of Westeros and actually ruled Targaryen and Baratheon. To me thats what kings blood actually means. Its not just someone of noble family that has kings blood but someone of Targaryen blood the blood of the dragon royal blood. House Baratheon was born from the bastard son of Aegon the Conqueror and has long been close with the Targaryen family and RobertStannisRenly had a paternal grandmother that was a Targaryen so they all had kings bloodblood of the dragon.Jon may have kings blood for different reasons but not because hes a Stark.,gameofthrones,cs4n3fw,2,t5_2rjz2

The past scene in the cave where Melisandre observes her fellow priest resurrect one of the Brothers Without Banners  served absolutely no purpose other than to A reinforce to viewers again that Rhllors power is in fact real and can be wielded by mortals in the realm and B resurrection IS possible in Game of Thrones. C Melisandre arrived at Castle Black with perfect timing as it happens. After a long season of brutal deaths and treachery we are going to get some serious SEp or Ep fan service with one of GRRMs power  POV characters brought back to life. Then the real fun begins.

Tywin showing up was a deus ex machina of epic proportions. I still dont understand the math there honestly. You have two forces going from point A to point B stanniss army and the tyrell army. Stannis puts the entire army on a ship and hightails it to kings landing. The tyrell army heads to highgarden waits for an alliance offer and then marches to kings landing. How on earth could they have possibly arrived at the same time? tywins army marched from harrenhall to kings landing so I can understand how they could have arrived at the same time.

Plus sellsword companies kinda dont really persist if they break their contracts like that. I think they just wanted to show that the Boltons knew Stannis was vulnerably and mopped him up.

GoT is already a fantasy world as it is if you want to add stuff like resurrection there has to be clearly defined rules and sound reasons why. To shock or evoke emotion is a shitty reason GRRM doesnt need to resort to killing and unkilling people to keep the suspense up for his books.Death seems to be the only almost certain thing in GoT if random vital people can cheat death GRRM better be able to explain why these people and only these people can cheat death or Id be pretty pissed.,gameofthrones,cs7ismm,1,t5_2rjz2

4280755,0,t1_cs83dl3,Yep this makes way more sense. Jon being shortsighted and going to try and reinforce Stannis in direct contradiction to his vows and having people really regret having to kill him was way more impactful to me.It was also much more reminiscent of Robbs death being caused by his own mistakes and all.In this case Jon is getting killed for doing the exact right thing and the Watch look incredibly shallow for putting their own feelings about the Wildlings ahead of the safety of the entire realm from the White Walkers.,gameofthrones,cs85rwv,7,t5_2rjz2

He won a terrible victory at Franklin which smashed his army but the Union retreated because they wanted to get to Nashville anyway. Hood followed or rather limped after and actually laid siege to a heavily fortified city that had more troops than Hood. Like Stannis Hood felt he had little choice but to follow thru with his grandiose plan of taking Nashville crossing the Ohio River and linking up with Lee in Virginia. After nearly two weeks the Union finally stirred and smashed Hoods weakened forces completely in a twoday battle. I think Stannis like Hood was so demoralized and could only just go forward with a fatalistic determination to see it through which was unfortunate for their men.,gameofthrones,cs8gf72,1,t5_2rjz2

Going against the watchs chain of command is completely contrary to his characterization. Olly on the other hand has had almost no characterisation he is only there as a vehicle to further Jons characterNights Watch ethos and so he constantly feels tacked on. ,gameofthrones,cs8njya,12,t5_2rjz2

4299014,0,t1_csa7tji,So shes gotten her protectors killed for associating with her Yorren was arguably Gendry but only Jacquen arguably died directly as a result of her recklessness.Syrio she was relatively innocent of but she did need rescuing.She tried to rush the stage where Ned was being executed thus needing rescuing from Yorren.Oh I forgot Tywin also had to rescue her at Harranhal. So she continues her streak of Getting into trouble and needing powerful men to come down and rescue her. After being rescued there she persists in clumsy spying attempts gets caught and... needs Jacquen to rescue her. And then rescue her again later. Also notice that she uses her free Jacquen kills to pursue petty vendettas and save herself not you know... do anything useful.The Hound she tried to rush the Red Wedding and did rush up and stab Frey soldiers both times would have gotten her captured or killed if he hadnt intervened on her behalf. She then failed to make any real attempt to interrupt the HoundBrienne pissing match leading to him getting killed.She then went to Braavos with no plan other than Show up and hope this coin means Jacquen rescues me again. Doesnt she also mouth off to the first street thugs she meets?The basic story Im getting is that to Arya selfpreservation means throwing herself into danger and waiting to be rescued.,gameofthrones,csa80ue,2,t5_2rjz2

4306679,0,t1_csb04t2,Start of season  A slow zoom up the road to Castle Black showing it fully manned and combat ready the gates open as a revived Jon Snow and Melisandre walk out Ghost running out ahead. The camera continues into Castle Black where we see several traitorous bastards hung. Getting a good look at each as the camera pan slows down so we can identify that neither Thorne nor Olly are among them. We begin to zoom up the wall passing the elevator on its way down and coming to the top. Once we reach the top of the wall we see a tall broad figure looking over the almost infinitely vast expanse of the North. The camera flips as we pass the figure to show Gendry in full black and his hands on his hips. He looks down to his feet camera moves parallel to his perspective to show a few fingers desperately hanging on to the edge. As Gendry begins to talk the camera shows two familiar faces Ser Allister and Olly.Well this was fun but I have a realm to protect. You two may stay here andSir Allister tries to bark some threat or order but the moment he opens his mouth his grip loosens and he is left barely clinging to the edge by his nails. Gendry continues without missing a beat looking over to the whimpering Olly.and I dont think we have much more to discuss. I think you can find your own ways down. For the Watch.Gendry leaves the two whimpering defeated traitors to fall to their deaths. The camera follows Gendry as he makes his way down to Castle Black discussing Lord Commanders business with several dutiful men. Davos is waiting by the elevator he gives Gendry a smile and congratulates him on getting the Wildlings to help on the wall and repelling a Bolton attack as punishment for quartering Stannis and his men.The two take a long elevator ride talking about the future issues and reflecting upon Jon Snow. When they reach the bottom we can hear someone screaming and get a shot through the gate of Ser Allisters body exploding from the impact. Several brothers gather around to watch the shit stain. Before they can disperse another scream can be heard from the top of the wall and moments later Olly splatters met with cheers from the loyal brothers.We then go to Meereen where we hear a Sienfieldesque intro as Tyrion walks into the throne room Vayrs already there and tending to his birds.EDIT This got way more detailed than I initially expected.,gameofthrones,csb36s5,15,t5_2rjz2

4308528,0,t1_csb3836,Also my issue is loads of mainrecurring characters seemingly diedcliffhanger.For all we know Bronn could have the antidote and save Myrcella. Brianne could hit the tree and not kill Stannis. Sansa and Theon could land safely on a bed of piled snow. Jon could get resurrected somehow.Or they could die. Bronn doesnt have the antidote. Brianne cuts Stanniss face or whatever. Sansa and Theon could die from the fall and not being enough snow to land on. Jon could not get resurrected.Its so unusual to have all these people completely disconnected and not together all die. The red wedding they were all in the same room so it made sense. So what happened was the episode was just such and such dies and oh these two jumped from a high wall and never shown again and myrcella bleeds from her nose and collapses and after one second cuts away never shown again. Eventually watching all these scenes became tedious. But also they arent confirmed. We know Joffrey died because he went purple and stopped moving. We know Tywin dies because he falls still.Were not shown any of this with any of the characters who died in episode . The only one we spend any time with is Jon and thats presumably because of his plot armour and all the unanswered questions which seem important to the story that havent been touched upon. ,gameofthrones,csbap4e,5,t5_2rjz2

4309280,0,t1_csapsf4,Im surprised how many people write up extremely long and elaborate arguments for why the Unsullied dying like stormtroopers makes sense in the show universe. Usually this revolves around the explanation that they arent trained for urban combat and policing and that spears are very ineffective weapons in close quarters combat which is the type of combat they are in in multiple scenes when being mowed down by the SoH. Id say this is creating an overly thought out overly elaborate explanation for what is probably just somewhat lazy writingdirecting. SOMEWHAT lazy to be clear Im not saying what the show runners have done to the Unsullied is a cinematic atrocity but the books and the show very clearly state that the Unsullied are trained in combat with short swords which are obviously the weapons that they should be using now that they are patrolling and fighting within the walls of a dense city. It doesnt take a military mastermind the likes of Stannis to figure that out. Either Gray Worm or... any other of the warriors present hell even Daario Naharis should have seen that straight away. Even after scores of Unsullied get killed including in a tight corridor fight where Barriston dies still only spears.I could go on but the point is Im so tired of the endless attempts at explaining away what is clearly just a little bit of subpar writingdirecting. ,gameofthrones,csbdr7s,13,t5_2rjz2

4311157,0,t1_csb1xh1,I feel like there are some details pointing us in the right direction. Probably just speculation but Mel showing up at Castle Black. Im assuming she left Stannis camp because she knew what was coming but why go back to Castle Black? Cant red priestpriestesses bring people back from the dead? Why ditch Stan the Man? IMO Mel knew all along that Stan wasnt Azor Ahi ? but that Jon was. I also think she knew from the beginning that Stannis would die and become a White Walker General but thats a different conversation.  GhostHis name is Ghost because he has white fur right? Or is it because Jons soul or ghost transferred to his direwolf? I think Mel will have to sacrifice Ghost to bring Jon back or something.

Its not hard to convince someone to follow you if they will otherwise die with a  chance.gtHe was also able to get elected as the head of the Nights WatchWhich he has to thank Sam for.gtRegardless of Jon Snows skills as a leader the Nights Watch already had corrupted bad seeds on the top that wanted him out in order to take the power for themselves. They just took that opportunity to fully conspire against him.So your saying Olly and Alliser killed him because they were power hungry? This is ridicolous. gtI think Jon Snow needed more friends in higher places to have his back. Sam was his best friend and really couldnt defend himself without a wolf.What he needed was a connection with the people he led. Fromm their perspection he was just a wildling lover which is pretty understandable considering that he barely talked about the white walker and why they needed the wildlings to anyone but his friends.

Besides Sansa agreeing to the marriage made sense to me shes shakily getting a hold of the Game thanks to Littlefinger and at least trusts his power plays to a degree. Him saying she can get revenge provoked her into the marriage and she went in under the impression Ramsay could be controlled. She was probably thinking after Joffrey noone could be worse.

Jaime in AFFC spends a ton of time in the Riverlands doing a whole lot of nothing whining about Cersei commenting on Ilyn Paynes pockmarks on his face and thats about it. The Dorne plot in AFFC would be really weird to do on TV because they basically introduce entirely new characters that youve never seen before and youll never see half of them again and honestly nothing really happens. Having Jaime go to Dorne instead of the Riverlands makes a lot of sense. Having Bronn come with works too in a character advancement sense rather than the book alternative where Cersei just bitches at the Stokeworths for  pages.AFFC is honestly a book where most of the main characters dont do a lot and they just spend a lot of time thinking about stuff that can be summarized with a couple  minute scenes of them actually talking about it.

Power is only a shadow on the wall and it only resides where men believe it resides. At this point charts like this dont even matter. Gendry cannot take the throne because nobody believes in that he has power in his claim to the throne.

4391981,0,t1_cskpes9,I have two theories on the last chapter.I think it will be a distant future glimpse of things.Characters that we currently know will be remembered as their titles glorified in a new age of heroes. They wont be Robb Stark and Tyrion Lannister they will be The Young Wolf and The Imp. Their deeds and traits will be exaggerated as myth and reality overlap with the ages. Maybe they say Robb turned into a wolf rather than commanded one. Or Tyrion really is a monkey demon.Im hoping itd be presented as a maesters book perhaps the literal song of ice and fire.The other ending Id really want would be a Rhaegar Targaryen pov. Its him before the battle of the Trident. He knows Lyanna is safe and his son will be born. He is preparing to dispose his father after he wins the battle. Then he will unite the realm against the coming danger.His son shall be the prince that was Promised. His shall be the song of ice and Fire. All he needs to do first is defeat the Usurper Baratheon.

When Renly combines his Stormlands forces with the Tyrells he has  thousand footsoldiers alone with several thousand knights.  If Westeros banded together against an invasion which I would assume it would politics dont matter much with a band of barbarians threatening the whole continent they would have an absolutely massive army with a ton of knights pikemen and crossbowmen.If just the Westerlands and the Riverlands sent armies to help the combined force would be over  .

As this video of the lore notes they have to design the rooms so the ceiling can collapse to drop sand on the Wildfire.Also the substance is unbelievably volatile.

4478539,0,t3_3cfrax,On the flipside Catelyn started the War of the Five Kings when she took Tyrion Lannister prisoner on a whim. edit Because people seem to think the inception of the War of the Five Kings is a debatable topic and keep contesting that Tywin or Joffrey started the war let me just share this from the wiki of Ice and Firegt The War of the Five Kings begins as a local conflict when Catelyn Stark seizes Tyrion Lannister for the attempted murder of her son Bran. Although he bears no special love for his son Lord Tywin Lannister refuses to allow the slight to his familys honor to go unpunished. In response he masses two hosts at Casterly Rock in preparation for an invasion of Catelyns homeland the riverlands. One host of  men is to be commanded by Lord Tywin himself while the other  men are to be commanded by his son Ser Jaime Lannister. Thats an objective unbiased assessment of the War of the Five Kings. People need to take of their rosetinted glasses and stop letting their proStarkness affect their reasoning. George RR Martin doesnt write black and white fiction where one side is pure bad and the other is pure good no matter how hard his audience tries to misinterpret it.,gameofthrones,csv6sn4,7,t5_2rjz2

Imagine a decent president or prime minister whoever leads you like Obama or Clinton trying to lead a nation like Afghanistan or Iran. Theres no conceivable way that it can be done well. Additionally Daenerys is also a very young woman who is trying to fix a very oppressive flawed culture. There are almost too many morally ambiguous decisions shes forced to make and no matter what she does her people and to a lesser extent certain fans will just demonize her for it and compare her to the Mad King. While undoubtedly entitled at times she has shown little inclination to becoming like Aerys or even Viserys she genuinely cares about the people of Slavers Bay meanwhile Viserys wouldve left given the first chance and would not have allowed the Unsullied the choice to fight for him. And Aerys burned innocent people and proceeded to rape his wife every night Dany makes questionable choices at times but at this point has shown very little inclination towards madness. If Dany continues to fumble with people who are generally on the same moral page as her Westeros then wed have a problem too bad theres only one way to find out.

4528714,0,t1_ct14b97,Firstly x is the same as x in reddits formatting so you can get rid of the space.Secondly no. With brackets you treat each level as a single term for example XYZ is simply XYZ. You would simplify one bracket at a time XYZ gt XYZ gt XYZ. It is different when there is more than one term WXYZ gt WXY  XZ gt WXY  WXZ and you must multiply accordingly. Because in RRGRM the GRM is one single multiplication term and not separated by  or  then you simply expand as in the first instance.Sorry if this doesnt make sense I tried my best.

I dont feel like the show is very good at conveying the emotional states of characters because nearly everyone is locked in a permanent snide cunning mode because its cooler to show Dany cold as ice instead of unsure of herself and its cooler to show Tyrion as permanently smarter than everyone instead of an emotional wreck.

4574210,0,t1_ct74p0r,I think GRRM does that a lot but only if its there to explore the worst of humanity that makes you question the reason they are all still going on. The story really focuses mainly on the storylines of Jon and Daenerys and with one of those huge story lines gone the wildlings are basically gone and the last hope of killing the white walkers is lost with his knowledge of valyrian steel and dragon glass even if sam succeeds in becoming a maister and learns more it will be too late. Jon needs to return in order to lead the true fight against the white walkers hopefully with daenerys. Plus his death allows him to leave the nights watch without breaking his vows. He didnt leave because he knew that he would be completely breaking his vows. Now that he is free from them he can help out with the wildlings or hopefully find his way to Daenerys with Mel as she is probably the true chosen champion of the god of light.,gameofthrones,ct76s5f,4,t5_2rjz2

4585776,0,t3_3dttm5,In my opinionthis has been the HBOs weakest season yet.Although the last three episodes were certainly excitingwith a lot of fightsunexpected deathsdragonswhitewalkersfans were forced to endure the seven episodes long drawn out build up first.The show failed to deliver on many of this seasons biggest promises. After all the hype surrounding the Sand Snakes  and four episodes of waiting  the trio turned out not to be the independent fierce feminine warriors which the show could have used but instead three more indistinguishable objects of sexual exploitation. In fact the introduction of Dorne left a lot to be desired.One of the most highly anticipated moments of the season was the longawaited meeting of Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen. However after eight episodes of stalling the pair shared about five minutes of screen time before the Mother of Dragons skipped town on Drogons back.Sansa and Theon Greyjoy remained in a stagnant state of fear until the finale  aside from that clumsy controversial rape scene. Stannis spent eight episodes playing the voyeur to Jon Snows growing leadership before his wisdom with Snow was undercut by his delusional desperation in the final two episodes.Overall the season had the feel of a show stretching for time before masking its shortcomings with anelectrifying finale. ,gameofthrones,ct8mxl9,21,t5_2rjz2

He appears to have some sort of personal code that he follows but it doesnt seem to align with any code that makes sense. I once heard many years ago that a good villain always has a reason why they do evil things but the reasons dont necessarily need to make sense to anyone else. Ive always found the villains whose motives I cant understand to be the most interesting. When I really realized I loved Roose he was talking about how fond he was off Walda. I believe he really is. Hes as spiteful petty cunning intelligent and cruel as anyone... but he really does have this cute relationship with naive Walda. Thats the kind of detail that sucks me right in. Ramsay on the other hand is just your typical wants to watch the world burn kind of villain. Those dont interest me much.

That makes no fucking sense. Nearly entire north was prosperous and happy under Stark rule because of their honor. Yet you claim that this honor is arcaic horrid and treats women like objects but you support a house whose sigil is a flayed man for Gods sake a house of rapists whose heir literally hunts what are essentially his sex slaves when he is bored of them.

4624939,0,t1_ctdgsvr,gt There is a specific scene in the earlier seasons where Mel runs into Thoros of Myr the red priest of Beric Dondarrion who was raised from the dead ? times. Her and Thoros have an eery conversation about resurrection so there is that to consider.Yes. In that scene he makes two things very clear  He Thoros denies having any power. The power comes from the Lord of Light not him.  He explains exactly how he does it. He just recites the proper words for his fallen friend following the known ritual. The Lord of Light takes it from there.If Thoros is right then Melisandre knows the words and the rituals already as a priestess of Rhllor herself and she doesnt need any special power just to call on the Lord of Light. She can therefore try to resurrect Jon and the only question is whether the god answers or not.,gameofthrones,ctdjp4q,33,t5_2rjz2

Regardless of the time period rape is rape. She didnt want to do it and he forced it on her. BUT Im saying that this scene isnt there for the sake of including a sex scene or because its glorifying rape. Its simply what would happen in the world that the story takes place in. Tyrion most definitely could have raped Sansa and it would be acceptable to everyone in the show heck it was encouraged by his father. That shouldnt have anything to do with how we view rape in our actual reality however rape is terrible and inexcusable.

Only recently since around the s has the word opinion been perverted to mean My own personal view  but it can still be incorrect.

4775997,0,t3_3gb4o6,Trickery. Hell march north with an army as their supposed ally remember his bold words about their alliance to Roose before he left. The reason for him showing up with an army could be quite plausible  He started the march when Stannis was still on the way.  The rest of the north might rise against the Boltons especially now Sansa is loose.  There is a Wildling army south of the Wall which might head south towards Winterfell.Then when opportunity presents itself hell turn on the Boltons with his army already in a good position to strike. I wouldnt be surprised to see him ally with other forces in the north too  other northern houses perhaps even with Sansas blessing or even with the Wildlings.,gameofthrones,ctwk20f,14,t5_2rjz2

4781319,0,t1_ctx4kyz,I agree Renly does not have a legal claim to the throne. His brother Stannis is legally in between him in the succession. However Robert did have a legal claim to the throne because of Targaryen grandmother. In normal times he would not be considered for the throne. This does not mean that he did not have a claim. After Aerys broke the vassal contract by murdering his bannermen along with his other multitude of crazy acts many of the lords of the Seven Kingdoms looked for a new king. Rhaegar was not a valid candidate because of the previously mentioned kidnapping and Robert was relatively closely related to Targaryens. His claim was therefore legally sufficient to gather banners to his cause to overthrow Aerys and place himself on the throne. The situation with Robb is not the same. Renly claimed lordship of the Seven Kingdoms over his brother. Robb claims the North by ancestral right and the Riverlands by his mother and at the bequest of the Lord Protector of the Riverlands. The Starks were basically returning to a preAegon state after Joffery betrayed the vassal contract. Robb was not fighting for the Seven Kingdoms just the North and the Riverlands.,gameofthrones,ctx84v8,0,t5_2rjz2

Not necessarily putting himself on the Iron ThroneAny throne but tearing down the powers at be. My friend argued it made sense with Petyrs whole complex about not having the knightly strength to defeat enemies but the wits to do it.

4901302,0,t1_cucc1s3,GRRM has stated in interviews that he has issue with characters being revived because it cheapens their death and that death needs to have consequences and change things if you are going to use resurrection as a plot device...Beric The Mountain etc...any character we see ends up changed.  So I think that yes Jon will not be the same Jon Snow we know...this will change him.  And knowing GRRM and how he takes characters that seem evil and shows their other side I believe he intends to do the same with the characters that seem overtly heroic and like the protagonists of a story from the opening...namely Dany and Jon.  We are already beginning to see that despite her good intentions and the hardships shes endured Dany is making some moves that other people clearly see as dark menacing...things a conquering Targ does with Fire amp Blood.  Hes shown us why shes like that and so shes not a villain but to many characters especially those in Westeros we know if she invades she is.  We may end up still rooting for Jon andor Dany and seeing the good in what they do but I think they are going to end up hurting people...hurting people we like to get the results they believe are morally right.  GRRM is against war mostly and while he believes just wars are sometimes necessary I think one of the main themes of this series is that both sides have heroes and villains and that war even for a good cause hurts everyone even good people.  The conclusion of this whole story where weve met people from all over from every family and all these continents and sides I believe is going to pit characters against each other and we wont want either side to lose...the series already made a change from the books along those lines...people like Brienne and the Hound and when they fought it was a moment that was hard for a lot of people...for many fans there was no winning scenario.  The only winning move is not to play the game of thrones to paraphrase wargames and the series.,gameofthrones,cuccior,29,t5_2rjz2

4942108,0,t3_3ilcog,Its sad that what people remember about the fool Robb Stark is that some of the decisions he made off of the battlefield didnt turn out for well for him.   He was a young man and following his heart  having to deal with crime and loyalty and a mother giving him trouble were challenging  but he made some good decisions too  on balance  things didnt work out for him  but they were complicated decisions. .  And he won every battle he fought and these did involve interesting tactical decisions and coordination of forces and use of the terrain.  And he fought directly in all of them. By contrast  everyone takes Davos word for Stannis being a military genius  and Stannis not only made horribly bad decisions about his family killing his brother and his heir and burning alive some relatives who refused to convert but also lost every battle on the screen he fought  to his credit he had previously won some battles before the series started.     So whos the fool here? As far as big armies...  Daenerys may yet assemble a big army surviving unsullied surviving second sons possibly Dothraki.   The Vale is supposed to have a sizable force now in the service of one Petyr Baelish.  The Dornish could have something going on.

Lets say theres  of them so we can count it better. You fold it once  you get  layers. You fold it again  you have  then     and then . Thats just six times and it can continue few more until the blacksmith is satisfied. Can you imagine how much time and money those swords would cost if you had to fold them thousand times each? Youd have to burn crap ton of coal on just one blade. Id probably rather stick to regular steel sword for men and dragon glass dagger for the Others. EDIT but yes melting it down would ruin it.

5003489,0,t3_3jfrce,I feel like Ive got an unpopular opinion here I felt Ed was much more charismatic and brought the real bad guy feel and look that Daario is supposed to have. Hes supposed to be enticing for Dany yet she has to question whether hes really a good guy or not Michiel is too nice guygood guy straight off the bat. And hes not hot to me hes cute. Which I dont believe fits the mysterious Tyroshi Sellsword whos been fighting all his life character. Mysterious is a key word there and Michiel doesnt look like hes hiding something the same way Ed does.,gameofthrones,cup3w98,21,t5_2rjz2

5077017,0,t1_cuxqaji,Exactly what I was thinking at this point it should be obvious to Jon that the Nights Watch  Does not have enough men to even hope to fight the WW army and  Most of them are too busy fighting about wildlings and other things to even unite them together to fight. Davos is a good man and without Stannis he has no interest in the battle for the Iron Throne at this point but when he hears about the WW threat and how substantial it is hell know that Jon is the only one who can get enough forces together to hope to stop them. Also Davos was there when Stannis offered Jon the chance to be legitimized as a Stark so he can make sure that Jon is recognized as a Stark. The North will be beyond happy to welcome a Stark back and I doubt that any of them will end up objecting to Jon being a Stark anyway but its still nice to have someone there who can verify that Stannis gave Jon the offer to be legitimized.,gameofthrones,cuxz0bh,3,t5_2rjz2

Also I believe that the main reason that Ned hid the truth about Jons birth is because if Robert knew that it was Rhaegars son he would immediately kill him so Lyanna made Ned promise to keep him safe no matter what including lying to his best friend about Roberts mortal enemys child with the love of his life.,gameofthrones,cv0xhtz,2,t5_2rjz2

The initial revolt was based upon Robert wanting Lyanna back and Ned wanting revenge for his murdered family members but as the war dragged on and in particular after Rhaegar was slain it became evident that a new dynasty was needed on the throne.Robert had the best claim having Targaryean descent on his grandmothers side. Naturally Ned supported his best friend Ned never wanted the throne for himself even less than Robert and he had no decent claim on it either. There were no proper Targaryens to claim the throne for though once Rhaegar was slain the rest of them were children or a Maester like Aemon.,gameofthrones,cvgshuy,1,t5_2rjz2

5281230,0,t3_3n8ybf,I believe Stannis is alive. For how long who knows? But I think when season  airs people will be surprised for sure. Hes still alive in the books for certain we know that much.Just watched that scene with Brienne in Season . Just look at her eyes when he says Do your duty. Just LOOK at her. They focused on her reaction with deliberate intent.Brienne will likely use Stannis in some way to retrieve or gain access to Sansa. Stannis has nothing left of his own and would likely face a grim death...but not yet. Perhaps Stannis will help Brienne back to the Wall and will be burned to save Jon. Wild speculation for sure. But more fun than him just being dead like that. And if Stannis became the sacrifice in order to save Jon the possible AA...well wouldnt that just be some lovely bittersweet irony right there?,gameofthrones,cvmqlot,1,t5_2rjz2
5282586,0,t1_cvmq3da,Given that the direwolves hadnt been seen south of the Wall for hundreds of years the probability of them coming across them would be something like  X  years  .  chance X probability of there being exactly  pups  in  as a very maximum probability. So . chance. X probability that there are  Stark children maximum  probability. So . probability. Or at an optimistic absolute maximum  chances in  million that there would be  direwolf pups south of the Wall on that day found by a family with exactly  children. The probability that the pups would also have the characteristics of the  children makes the probability essentially zero. So Id say its a much  higher probability that its NOT random. Sometimes the almost impossible is the most likely option. So I think someone sent them to the Starks.  Note I am definitely not a statistician but this was fun to try and calculate.

Azor Ahai theory and Melisandre resurrecting Jon are not mutually exclusive theories in fact they are pretty much dependent on each other. As Thoros stated a priest only says the words they do not hold power. Whether someone is resurrected or not is all up to Rhollor. Azor Ahai might be Rhollors chosen. Therefore to create Azor Ahai Rhollor could use Melissandre as a tool. Just as he used Thoros to resurrect Beric.Whether Jons body can burn or not does not imply anything about his lineage. It was an exception that Danny did not burn. Her brother did burn alive and he was Targaryen. Maester Aemons body was burned too he was also a Targaryen.,gameofthrones,cvpej8f,3,t5_2rjz2

XDBtw the original emblem of Game of Thrones already placed Targaryens above and Baratheons below which always makes more sense since the fight for the IronThrone is mostly between Lannisters and Targaryens.

5718695,0,t3_3tg028,Youre taking things out of context. In the show Drogo is portrayed a savage in their bedding whilst in the book he shows respect and wonder through the ceremony. Of course shed fear the savage at  or . Dany was craving love in whatever form she could find and Drogo gave it to her in the books. Age is somewhat irrelevant here.But both manners work. One is portrayed a savage beeding her wife as was his right as a Khal would do and another is portrayed respecting her wife according to their cultural ceremony as a Khal would do. Both work and they still represent the same exact character just under different circumstances. It is also worth mentioning that they didnt fall deeply in love. She was raped in the coming nights afterwards and its not like they were lovers  he was still a silent rock unwavering and unkind. The progression aftwerards is much like in the show as Dany embraces the Dorthraki as her people and accepts their culture. Both in the books and the show she accepted her fate her new status and realized if she were to have a home it would be among her new people.,gameofthrones,cx5ykuv,5,t5_2rjz2

5748452,0,t3_3ttufy,Id give Drogo the edge. Jorahs fighting style is very defensive and I imagine he could hold out for a pretty long time but Drogo wouldnt make the kind of rookie mistakes the other Dothraki that fought Jorah did. Just sort of stand there dumbly for five seconds when he cant pry the sword out from Jorahs armor. Plus Drogo was physically more powerfully built and had a much more fearsome intimidating presence.For Jorah to win he would probably have to pull off the same kind of trick that Bronn amp Oberyn did only in reverse. In this case the more heavily armored fighter focusing almost entirely on blocking attacks in the hopes that the more lightly armored fighter would eventually tire out and create an opening.

Also the whole Bran thing alludes to a much bigger threat via the white walkers than we may realize otherwise the Bran thing doesnt make a lot of sense so I think the white walkers are a bigger threat than we know.If thats the way it plays out Im not sure how theyd end up fighting each other if they were kicking ass together on dragons...but this could be a long shot theory as well.,gameofthrones,cyeuvpn,1,t5_2rjz2

They know where the story is going and all the major beats they need to hit for each character. However because they dont have the books theyll have to write all the various interactions and conversations themselves. Sometimes their dialogue is great Jons speech to the wildlings at Hardhome Olenna confronting the High Sparrow other times less so the Sand Snakes dialogue leaps to mind. So basically they have a framework for the entire story but will have to fill in the gaps on their own rather than being able to use the books. ,gameofthrones,cyqsepd,3,t5_2rjz2

6180048,0,t3_407ipm,If you can go so far as calling the Faith a cult and the HS a cult leader you go into a researched and very interesting often scary field of psychology. The thing about being a good cult leader is that you want to be able to believe the bullshit you are selling so that your faith appears genuine to your followers and lieutenants or you will be exposed as a snake oil salesman.You want to keep some faith but you want to always be aware of what exactly you are doing what the endgame is and be careful not to become dependent on the adoration of your flock and the beginnings of personality cult because all people are corruptible after the right angle and amount of pressure is found and if you become too drunken on yourself and powerhungry you become vulnerable and dangerous to yourself and others. Most people who spend too long time on the top of a pyramid scheme with a human element cults of indoctrination not pyramid schemes selling silly merchandise become easy targets for usurpers and asskissing backstabbers especially if they have nave Jesuscomplexes and think they can actually challenge the status quo and pull off a revolution.The High Sparrow hit the ground running when it came to making moves throwing the wellknown murderous QueenMother in jail. He must have very good confidence in his options fallback plans and exit strategies to turn and bite the hand that handed him a chip in the game literally within a month of being promoted from the shitfilled gutter. Either that or he doesnt care about his own life and just wants to get as far as he can with the chance hes got. I doubt he is a moron.Maybe his birds have given him ample information of just how much support and future recruits there actually is to find in the land maybe he hopes to safeguard his position by having paramilitias and chapters in all towns everywhere. There certainly must be a lot of people tired of all the rich nobility riding around having sex killing people and spending gold on silly things.

6318934,0,t1_cz7p9ro,That makes no sense. Why would he do that now when he could have more easily killed Myrcella or let her get killed earlier in the Water Gardens when the Sand Snakes were attacking them. Why would he let himself get instigated in the crime through direct association now instead of back then when he could say the Sand Snakes were the cause of it? My argument is the same as Tyrions when he was locked in the cellar... why would the abettor or perpetrator of a crime be at the scene of the crime to incriminate themselves unnecessarily? And if he wanted war there were more direct ways to start it and why kill off a royal hostage in that situation which would be a very important asset to keep? Doran isnt Joffrey. We know because Oberyn and everyone else in the kingdoms precede him with the graceful reputation. Peoples reputation remain more or less consistent in this universe even the sly Littlefinger who everyone warily trusts. But then again nothing about the Dornish plot made any sense. Why would Doran even let Elaria within  miles of Myrcella let alone see her off? Why would he risk anything like this happening in a critical moment as seeing off the connections he had with the Iron Throne. ,gameofthrones,cz7w5ht,1,t5_2rjz2

As other comments stated they communicate wear different clothes and use different weapons. Theyre also intelligent enough to control the wights in battle against humans. However the best proof of the others intelligence is the legend of The Nights King. He was the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Nights Watch who took a white walker to be his wife and declared himself King. Eventually Bran the Breaker and Joramun the King Beyond the Wall at the time rallied to defeat him.  The fact that a human man married a white walker woman and the fact that she helped him rule shows me that they have to have some form of higher intelligence.,gameofthrones,czbo270,1,t5_2rjz2

6417497,0,t3_43lkas,YES. absolutely.  The books offer far far more insight and even tells you more of the story.  The story is very big and long so the show really had no choice but to leave a lot of things out.  So you will meet new characters and even new smaller stories by reading the books. And also you get a complete better understanding of the history of the houses and families and of Westeros itself.  Sure you know all the surprises and fun things that happen but honestly that really wont matter.  Just to see how everything forms and to read the story as it was originally written is well worth it.  Highly recommend it.  But dont skip over any chapters thinking its the same as the show because thats not the case.  Read every page from the first book to the last.  And after reading all the books you can read all the theories over at rasoiaf.  A lot of it will blow your mind and will make you want to read them again.  And be sure to read the short stories that GRRM wrote called the Tales of Dunk and Egg.  A very great story about a hedge knight and his squire taken place in Westeros but  or so years before the events of the novels.  As far price Im not sure if ebay or amazon is available to you but online is the way to go.  Try to buy all books at once as a bundle if you can might save you money.  But yes it is worth it.  Or if your abel to download them some how onto your computer or like a kindle you can try that.  Hope to works out,gameofthrones,czj3s2v,29,t5_2rjz2

She will lead an army of stone men who I believe operate similar to the white walkers and their wights to westeros and clash with Jon Snow and his White Walkers. Her army will likely consist of Dothraki soldiers who she will kill via the Grey Kiss. I think itd be a nice ending because she originally planned to cross with a Dothraki army.

EDIT This is really tin foil and something that is more alike the AGOT mod for Crusader Kings  I have  hours on it btw.. great mod better than the base game. But if RLJ is true Jon is of Targaryen blood not Baratheon and the Baratheon line of succession even without the bastards Joffrey etc. will still fall to Stannis and then Shireen.,gameofthrones,d03r910,0,t5_2rjz2

None of the people I watch with have the slightest clue about his parentage.  Somebody put together a youtube video of all the show hints.  It runs about  minutes.  Of the approximately  hours of show we have only  minutes of it can help you come to the conclusion that RLJ.   minutes buried in  hours of tv.

Neither of their roles have been replaced yet theyve just been sort of erased from GoT history but shoehorning Arianne in now would be terrible as it would be sudden and a living Myrcella is fairly important to her story line.

Now a lot of this was Western e.g. Mediaeval England so its natural those characters might end up represented as white.Narnia  C s Lewis and Middle Earth  The Lord of the Rings are both big fantasy worlds for me as a Brit. For sure they can be analysed as very Anglocentric but they predate the civil rights  political correctness movements becoming big so maybe thats natural.My impression is that Hollywood maybe not just TV takes a very inclusivist approach to race representation. e.g. the Robin Hood Kevin Costner film has a black guy Morgan Freeman put into it it feels totally unnatural if you are British.,gameofthrones,d0h81z1,1,t5_2rjz2

6948170,0,t3_4aseg1,I think Season  will be great though we will have to wait and see. I am a book reader but I am very open to most changes theyve made in the adaptation. Season  was a huge letdown for me since Im in the minority who actually love A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons and I though that the way they handled several stories was unsatisifying The Wintefell Stannis DanySelmy Death Arya Brienne storylines. And Dorne was just awful throughout except for that scene involving Tyene and Bronn. I loved Jon and Tyrions storylines though and Hardhome is my third favourite episode of GOT ever.Im hopeful for season six. The one thing that Ill take me a lot of convincing is Sansa as a legitimate ruler and Queen in the North. I cannot stand her character  and no its not because she isnt like Arya  and j dont think at this stage she can be an effective ruler of the North I hope Jon comes in to become King or even Rickon.Im excited for Bran for the flashbacks for the Greyjoys though I hope they dont destroy Eurons character Kings Landing The Northern story Jaime venture into the Riverlands The Wall involving Jon Arya Tyrion ruling Meereen.

Even at the Eyrie Cat realizes shes been a fool.I mean dont get me wrong Cat ticks me off as well with some of the stupid shit she does but shes honestly not that dumb.The Jaime thing is where she just straight up goes emotional which is perfectly understandable but also very very bad in every way. As for the rest of it shes basically a regular person as in not a geniusgreat gameplayer like LF or Varys doing the best she can and its honestly not that bad. Compare her to Cersei the other mother trying to protect her kids and shes a goddamn paragon of detached intelligence. Compare her to someone like Olenna and she doesnt shine very bright.Thats basically Cat. Shes more or less a normal person trying to navigate a series of extreme situations. Even at the point of releasing Jaime she probably keeps her head a lot better than most of us would do just having lost two children having the other two taken hostage by awful people and the last one leading a war from the front lines. Which isnt mentioning her husband having been killed by the same people who she thinks has her daughters her dad dying and her sister having gone insane.All I am saying is cut the lady some slack. Its not like she has a heart of Stone.,gameofthrones,d18b1o2,5,t5_2rjz2

7001250,0,t3_4bjn5k,Like you said shes a kid. A really smart kid like you say but shes not exactly versed in what would be most strategically important even to just her own personal interests if that makes any sense. Shes also in a horrible situation Harrenhal in which she is simply trying to survive while also experiencing major PTSD as a child. She also doesnt completely trust Jaqen right away hes wearing Lannister armor and all that plus hes kind of a weirdo at least at first so shes really just trying to lay low I think. I could be wrong on all that though.Like others have said the first one was a test. The second one was where she needed a way out real quick otherwise she probably would have named a more high profile person the third time was to get the heck out of Harrenhal. If she would have named Tywin right off the bat what then? Would everyone be released from Harrenahal or would have something worse happened i.e. they kill all the prisoners? No way to know now but its something to consider. Personally I think it makes more sense in the books since we get her POV on the whole matter but I wont go into book spoilers. ,gameofthrones,d19xph9,1,t5_2rjz2

Roose would personally denounce Ramsay if he ever found out how he treated her. He needed Sansa healthy and with a Bolton child for there to be any legitimacy to there hold.

Like go ahead. Tell me how littlefinger taking sansa to marry ramsay makes sense. Come on. Also its disingenuous to say that the people who criticize these things are overboard realize they criticize the stuff heavily cause they care for it. George lucas did the same thing with the prequelsfans criticized the movies he didnt listen and look what happened.And the reason people act hostile towards those who liked objectively bad things is because they figure that those people would be happy with the product regardless of the quality. ,gameofthrones,d1mdidv,-30,t5_2rjz2

7144947,0,t3_4dersm,Alright so the war in Season  was commonly referred to as the War of  kings. The  kings are Joffrey Stannis Renly Robb and Balon. . Joffrey Anyone who doesnt beleive that Joffrey is a bastard born of incest between Cersei and Jaime acknowledges Joffrey as the rightful heir to the iron throne.. Stannis Stannis discovers through the letter from Ned Stark as well as his own suspicions that Joffrey was not Roberts son. Since Robert doesnt have any true born sons Stannis is the rightful heir to the Iron throne.. RenlyRoberts youngest brother and while the throne should go to his brother Stannis Renly believes that Stannis is not fit to be a king and believes that hell make for a much better king. Renly has no right to the iron throne until Stannis dies since Stannis has no sons.. RobbRobb never wanted to be a king. After his father was taken prisoner Robb and his army marched south to Kingsland with the hope of freeing his father. Obviously things dont go so well however Robb and his men decide that it would be best if they ruled themselves. Its important to note that Robb doesnt want to rule Westeros however he no longer wants to be under its rule either.. Balon in many ways is similar to Robb. Balon has no intention in ruling Westeros however he wants to be free from Westeros as well. Balon declares himself King of the Iron Islands which essential is no different then what he is now.,gameofthrones,d1qazws,35,t5_2rjz2

7233573,0,t1_d1zzrke,I didnt really get the impression they respected her actions in the slightest. Justice is an imaginary concept and it wasnt particularly apt for what she did. Rather she enacted petty vengeance. And all her selfrighteousness came back to bite her the moment she realised that the slave  master situation wasnt as morally monochrome as she had believed. Whatever the display of strength achieved was shortlived.Perhaps your idea that she should have eliminated the nobility entirely might have worked... but I doubt it would have been easy to achieve. Some would have slipped through the cracks and then been forced to act against her out of desperation. Rather I believe the opposite approach would have been more appropriate.  Making a far smaller number of examples before giving the majority an extra chance each and then continuing to make larger numbers of examples with each further transgression.  The point here is to ensure that the nobles still had a lot to lose and thus more incentive to play nice.   What she did by executing so many of them right from the start is push them right the way through the safe fear zone into the desperation zone on the far side ensuring that they would do their utmost to act against her having lost anything that might hold value to them. ,gameofthrones,d20eklm,1,t5_2rjz2

7237862,0,t3_4eh2dd,Its a terrible Idea. In Westeros there are only a small number of institutions that can afford to loan money to the Iron Throne in the first place. That being the Iron Bank the Church and the Richest Lords.Secondly The Iron Bank is not Even Westerosi. It is completely free of government interference and government Abuse. You know why no bank ever formed in Westeros that could hold a candle to even the minor banks of Essos? As soon as a Lord or king got greedy or desperate it would nationalise the Banks claiming to be saving the country from Usurers and then help itself to the banks savings wipe out its debts and run the bank into the ground.finally and this is the biggest problem with these articles. A feudal state like Westeros has no need for a pederstrian loan company.

7243498,0,t1_d21by79,Okay...  We DO know they WILL get South of The Wall. Reasons The story has been building up to another Long Night and the war for the dawn this war wont take place North of The Wall.  One or two whites might sneak under the wall but how could the White Walkers even know about these tunnels if they have the power to bring the wall down why would you try and sneak an army through a small tunnel.  As we saw in Hardhome the White Walkers tend to be sensitive to most elements that arent snowice in the trailer it looked like the White Walkers didnt care about fire either hence why they wait until the long night to push south. They probably dont have the initiative within them that tells them to climb The Wall or sail around it.

I sort of agree on your second point. But to me the problem isnt that he brings in Maggy too late its that he doesnt make Cersei a POV character until AFFC. In some cases thats a good thing because weve seen her be a total ass and now we get to see the motivation behind it but at the same time it wouldve been so much better to follow her from the very first book.

7328550,0,t3_4fqs2x,If Tywin was raising a host to march on kings landing to either save or avenge Jamie Robert would immediately raise the Stormlands. The north would raise along with the Riverlands to avenge Ned. The Reach would rise for him as well Renly was already plotting to make Margaery queen and had ties with the Tyrells and this would be the perfect opportunity to try to weaken the lannisters and damage the CersieRobert relationship. That leaves just Dorne and the Vale and the iron islands. The Vale might stay out of it because of Littlefinger meddling but I dont see there being any chance of them raising banners for Tywin. Dorne hates the Lannisters and might join the fight against them. The iron islands would stay out of it or just weave the coast of the westerlands and claim to king Robert they were helping. Tywin would be outmanned with enemies to all sides. As amazing a leader as he is I do not see him coming out on top. ,gameofthrones,d2b7fs8,8,t5_2rjz2

Otherwise having a tower of joy scene would not make sense especially given that the greensight does not work exactly like that in the books. So yes in that case it would make sense for snow to be dead for the season and it would explain why Kit Harington was only there playing a corpse by his own admission for two months of filming. Eventually they will have to burn the body lest they risk it turning to a wight.

7371498,0,t3_4gb8j3,My reactions . Overall I feel like theres a much more lighthearted and even humorous approach that I think comes from the writers directing it more now. From Davoss crack about mutton something I cant picture book Davos saying he would have reached for his fingerbones only to become depressed and reflective when they werent there to Tyrions joke about Varys I feel like Tyrion normally makes darker more bitter jokes although it may just be because his character is in a different situation now and so on and so on. . Im gonna miss Aero even though they never did anything with him in the show. I loved him in the books. Even though his chapters were few and farbetween he was such a badass with an awesome perspective. He will be missed.. Idk about cerseis reaction. I kind of expected her to scream at jaime. I think her character is legitimately changed by the sparrows locking her up possibly a good thing? and its gonna be interesting. . Overall pretty great.  . Edit I forgot to say that I think that when they show Ollie theyre making him purposefully even more hateable. Maybe cause hes gonna die soon and they dont want us to feel bad for a kid? I hope so.

7371542,0,t1_d2g29xj,It makes sense. Dorne doesnt view bastards in the same way the rest of westeros does and she literally said all your peole hate you because youre weak and give in to rest of westeros. Dornes words unbowed unbent unbroken literally comes from the fact that anyone from westeros that has tried to fuck with Dorne has been sent back running dragons and armies not withstanding. Elia her children and Oberyn were brutally murdered and Doran just takes it. You see the guards disgust while she murders Doran and even says their people hate his weakness. And on top of that those bastards are Oberyns im pretty sure which would still make them royalty. Also Dorne is actually a pretty seperate part of the  kingdoms. They were brought into the kingdoms way later than the rest and even then Id say most of the kingdoms are too far to care about them or hate them for example the tyrells. Everyone else doesnt give a shit. The dornish mostly stay in Dorne. It makes sense but Whether you just hate the storyline is another thing.

No more heir. Doran revealed that to the Sand Snakes after they had kidnapped Myercella and she was injured. Its safe to say that war between Dorne and Westeros was going to happen and certainly after the Sand Snakes learned that Dany wasnt coming they would have wanted to start the war anyway.And war would likely happen no matter what after Myrcella was maimed.,gameofthrones,d2g971x,1,t5_2rjz2

7382840,0,t1_d2hcxqu,But would she kill an unarmed man who lost everything  the last of the true Baratheons? I dont think she would. Chivalry dictates such a thing to be the gravest of sins. Shes a knight with a strict moral code not an assassin. We must ask ourselves would she ultimately follow through with her oath to Renly would she have to kill Stannis to fulfill her oath? Catelyn told her explicitly that Renlys dead and its not worth it to blindly fulfill an oath of a dead man when it comes at extreme disadvantage to yourself. And I think Brienne has started to take this to heart. The fact that Brienne doesnt just charge into Bolton Winterfell but chooses to wait instead is a shining example of her change in character. She is no longer the overzealous naive knight that she once was. She now understands that a knight must think for herself to weigh the pros and cons of a situation and act with both righteousness AND intelligence. Furthermore let us consider who else is left that could rally soldiers to the cause against the Boltons who we know Brienne understands to be a grave threat? Who else has the connections or the authority needed to do anything? There is one man who could and she commands his fate. To any of the good characters Stannis is a valuable asset and to kill him outright when you could have him indebted to you is a very simple choice. I just think that knowing everything we know about Brienne plus the circumstances that she has found herself in she would spare Stannis if not for anything else but the fact that he is the one person that might be able to do something against tyranny.,gameofthrones,d2hdnef,2,t5_2rjz2

7386529,0,t3_4gb8is,Im so certain they took the Sand Snakes and built the Dorne plot around them and Elaria to appeal to the whole empowered women thing. I mean think about it this seasons focus is mostly on womens roles which is fine. But the Dorne plot is crap they didnt do it well at all and it feels so forced its so blatant.We havent really seen the city or barely any of the people of Dorne its so . We havent seen them displeased with their prince and apparently only one guard was ready to defend his prince. Somehow Elaria amp SS convinced all the other guards there to plot against their prince even though he never leaves his palacegarden lol. Or we are supposed to believe the guards wanted him to die all along? Why would they want that though? What could Elaria amp SS grant them ? Would they really give a shit about revenge ? And they whine about Oberyn whom they will never do justice with their shitty dialogue. The biggest problem is that its too blatant why theyre giving the plotline to SS because they are DampDs babies. But theyve shown theyre not capable of writing believeable main characters into the show that are up to par to the quality of GRRM.,gameofthrones,d2hsq5r,3,t5_2rjz2

So Tristane was not killed in the harbour before the trip to Kings Landing unless the crew were in on it then why not kill Jamie and the princess the same way ?. Doran is also informed by letter that the princess has died. Tristane is also making eyed stones implying he has not reached Kings Landing yet when he is killed so he cant have been killed in the harbour after the trip to Kings Landing. So maybe the Dornish ship stayed a while in Kings Landing ?

7389264,0,t1_d2hzwuk,gt What bothers me is that Dorne was sorta you know the good guys for most of the story. There was definitely a lot to root for in their general philosophy.  We treat men and women equally we do not shame the lowborn or bastards we defend our lands but try not to intrude in meaningless conflict.  I love the idea of dorne however the realities are not so great.  On the show its outright terrible but even in the books its less interesting than I thought it would be.  What the fuck kind of plan is we let women rule in dorne so therefor we should take myrcella and claim she is the true ruler of the kingdom. . .  First off to get to that point you have to do exactly the same thing as just taking the throne for yourself conquer it.  Secondly they make it seem like putting myrcella on the throne is some worthy cause even though she doesnt want it and no one else that could possibly aid in their attacks allows women to rule.  Third their problem is with the lannisters not really the kingdom as a whole.  They care about their small folk a war would destroy them.

They have each evolved to be much more sympathetic through their individual suffering but part of that had driven them apart and shown each that the other cant be relied upon. They spent  seasons evolving in one direction and then suddenly in one scene they are right back to the beginning.

7410151,0,t3_4gnu3v,The Dorne scenes are pretty weak but almost everything you say is just wrong or misunderstood. For one no one will shut up about Dorne so clearly it interests viewers a lot. gt Not only do the Sand Snakes do this seemingly just for funThey dont do it for fun they do it to start a war with the Lannisters. That has been made very clear several times.gt They dont strike me as people who want to rule Dorne either is their motivation power? Why would they want more power what more power is there for them to have?They want to put whoever controls Dorne into a position where they have to start a war. Presumably now theyll control Dorne somehow but either way Dorne is going to war.gt Prince Doran seemed like a great plotter and mastermind in the books always plotting from behind the scenes but with a calm and collected pace of planning not unlike Tywin Lannister.For all his plotting in the books there is never a single instance where one of his plans comes to fruition. It isnt even some outlandish unpredictable twists that fail him he just has expectations of his brother children and nieces that theyll clearly never meet. Doran is just a Targaryen loyalist waiting for his masters to get back.gt As one of the greatest fighters in westerosi history Hotah Oh give me a break. The guy is a bodyguard. He probably hasnt had a life or death fight in longer than Obara has been alive. He doesnt even get to train that much he just stands around in corners and thinks about how much of a badass he is.gt Prince Doran shouldve foreseen the Sand Snake rebellion especially when he found out Myrcella had been killed.The note he received informed him of that which gave him about  seconds to react to the news before getting stabbed. Ellaria knew what was in the note Doran did not. Ellaria was there specifically to kill him when he gets the note.gt Would a masterful strategic mind in a high position really read a secret message like that out loud in front of anyoneIt was not a secret message it was regular correspondence and he didnt read it out loud.gt Dorne is the strongest of the seven KingdomsHighly doubtful. The Vale and The Reach are both bigger more densely populated and better supplied while having suffered no casualties. Exhausted as they are the Lannisters are probably still stronger than Dorne on their own not that the Dornish have any way to get to them at all.The story is bad though that I am not arguing with.,gameofthrones,d2khhrs,1,t5_2rjz2

7424125,0,t1_d2lxqns,Enjoying a TV show has nothing to do with intelligence. Good TV can last with us for life. I still watch Lost in its entierty every few years and The West Wing and other of my favorite shows over and over and will for the rest of my life. Game of Thrones will definitely be on that list.The TV show is still the best show on television. Are the books better? Maybe probably but books have more detail and take x more time to get through than the TV Show. But the books also have their downsides like GRRM taking  pages to describe a meal and sometimes the slow pace will have you thinking of skipping over chapters. OP dont use this as any part of your reasoning. The TV Show is great. Toward the end some things happen differently and some characters are a little different. These decisions were made for a reason to help enhance the show. That doesnt make it where NOBODY will care about this TV show in a decade. I think its had a huge impact on all of our lives and will continue to do so. I would do both if I were OP. Start the TV show and read the bookslisten to audiobooks in the car. The books are just as enjoyable after youve seen the show. I like to find the differences and speculate on why. The truth of the matter is you will not hear the ending by book for another  years. Better off to watch both and enjoy the show while its here and current.,gameofthrones,d2m2p1i,1,t5_2rjz2

7451329,0,t1_d2p01lt,Yeah I figure white walkers I meant as well but I didnt want to commit given all of the other cryptic hidden meanings in the series.Tbh I only ever made my theory based on the first paragraph which is why it made a lot more sense. The theory falls apart a bit when you look at other references to Azor Ahai. Not sure about the lineage part because it seems pretty individual specific although I cant recall anyone else drawing a sword from flames. Thats the issue.Even with all possible metaphors and things I cant think of a way to reconcile the fact that the first passage seems to explicitly refer to dany and the second to stannis. There doesnt seem to be any overlap where both could be applied to the other one or anyone really.,gameofthrones,d2p63lt,1,t5_2rjz2

Eurons as piratey as a pirate can be hes sailed literally everywhere including rumors of him traveling to Valyria itself.

He waited so long because he was trapped in that room without her I think during the last episode. He saw her once but it might not have immediately occurred to him.Re Stannis doesnt make sense for Davos to ride off looking for Stanniss body based on something that may or may not work. It might make sense now that he knows it works for him to try and get Melisandre to bring Stannis back and she might be willing to since it means her visions might not have been wrong.,gameofthrones,d2p8wtg,26,t5_2rjz2

7455008,0,t1_d2p3zh7,If I remember it right the show where he gets the news that Walda is pregnant is called Kill the boy. I know the title could be interpreted in many ways and it was basically what the Maester said to Jon Snow meaning he should grow up and be a man but you could interpret the title in  waysRamsay kills his baby brotherJon grows up gets stronger and turns into a more feared leaderJon kills Ollie Kill the boy was the episode where a lot of us hoped he would do it but he forgave himMy guess is that all of those will come true and Jons character will change a bit. I expect Jon killing Olliewithout trialofficial beheading but in a brutal revenge type of manner which would be untypicalof his old ways. I dont expect him to get corrupt or evil I think he still be the old Jon in most waysbut I think he will be a lot less soft and forgiving from now on.I might be totally wrong on this but everything comes back to that Kill the boy episode where we thought of all the possibilities what the title could mean and I think all of those possibilities will turn out right.,gameofthrones,d2pl5a9,1,t5_2rjz2

7456593,0,t3_4hicto,I knew it was coming but I still hate this development so much. In the books Roose talks about how even Ramsays loyal bastards boys were given to him by Roose and arent Ramsays men as he believes. All the northern lords fear but respect Roose but see Ramsay as a psycho kid and Ramsay has done little to nothing to earn the loyalty of the Bolton men as a whole. Basically the maester should have gone to basically any high ranking person in the castle and had Ramsey seized for the murder. Why Karstark is just fine with it is not explained well at all when the murder of Roose is going to destroy all the work he did to unify the North.But hes Ramsay so likely things are going to go fantastic for him because of his plot armour. Everyone will believe Roose was poisoned and that Walda and the baby ran away or something.

I could see Jon winning the Battle of Winterfell however Wun Wun stomping around the courtyard fractures various tombs in the crypt.  After the battle Jon traverses the crypts and is sad to see so many tombs damaged.  He comes across Lyannas and gets a glimpse of something inside.  He doesnt know what to make of it however.If the Tower of Joy segment spans beyond the skirmish with the Kingsguard then Bran and the audience will find out the truth.  As Jon gets situated in Winterfell Bran will eventually catch up with him.  Not only will Jon have the word from a greenseer but also evidence from the tomb.,gameofthrones,d2ty6jp,2,t5_2rjz2

7524200,0,t3_4idzu0,Cersei seduced his  son made him kill the king and after that she hit him in during Blackwater when Lancel was telling Cersei to send Joffrey back to battle. Lancel had been wounded but the arrow had not sink that deep before Cersei hitting him. The following was explained in the books only if I recall correctly but Lancel was ill for a very long time and very nearly died. It was during this period he became very religious mostly because he felt guilty of his past actions.And Lancel seems to have told in the books about the CerseiJaime incest or Kevan figured it out in his own. In any case he knows the entire war is her and Jaimes fault ultimatelly. Kevans two kids only  in the show one was the son of his sister Genna that is not in the show Martyn and Willem were murdered by Karstark after Catelyn freed Jaime. So the deaths of them and the near death of Lancel and his current mental health issues are untimatelly all Cerseis fault. And he is not happy with Jaime in the books either. Additionally in the books Cersei refused to make Kevan Hand and Jaime made comments after Kevan revealed he knew of incest that sounded like threaths even though they were not.  Besides all this Cersei is quite incompetent even more so in the books. Kevan always did.what Tywin said but that was because he respected and loved Tywin and now Cersei thinks he will just do what she tells him despite not earning respect. However Kevan might be just a bit ambitions and pridefull in any case and wants power since he has been so long been just the sidekick for Tywin. He is a Lannister after all.In the show most of this is all there but since it is not clarified it kind of looks like Kevan is being just sexist. So I hope he would get a bit more screentime this season and charcater development.,gameofthrones,d2xgq68,3,t5_2rjz2

7531260,0,t3_4ihick,So I guess in all seriousness that whats happening with Rickon is just some ploy to con Ramsay. Winterfells very own Rickon Roll      Think about it Ramsay isnt one for strategy and has a very head first approach of doing things. Roose was literally talking about this right before he was ahem poisoned. So that said why the hell isnt Rickon dead? If your so hell bent on keeping your claim why wouldnt you just kill the very individual who is very likely to take that claim from you? Plus if Ramsay were going to kill Rickon which the loose cannon very well would why not kill him this episode? You placed the scene at the end of the episode and you would have shocked everyone. Rickon had been gone for a long time no need to save him for the end ep.  just off him now and be done with that plot.       Because we didnt see Ramsay outright kill the boy and REALLY make a statement Im going to assume this is the writers giving us a bit of suspense before we see Rickon and the Umbers really wreck shop.       Now lets talk about the Umbers and Rickon and Osha. When Rickon and Osha left a very long time ago they would have made it to wherever they were going a very long time ago. This means that wherever they ended up theyve been there for a while. Additionally this was during the War waged by Robb Stark which tells me that they either intentionally went to the Umbers or they got picked up by the Umbers who have for some reason been keeping Rickon safe. Who by the way looks fairly healthy and without the look a prisoner for an extended period of time may look. So I doubt theyve been held captive very long.      So Rickon fell into the hands of people who as mentioned in this episode were loyal to the Starks. I very much doubt that during his time there Rickon was treated anything but good. On that note why the hell would the Umbers then bring Rickon to the traitorous Boltons? Additionally if they were going to see Rickon die or do this going back on the Starks why not kill Rickon show the world and make alliances? Why wait until so long after  seasons . the wedding to make this kind of move?     Better yet why were the Umbers allowed into Winterfell?       Also whats or who? all that stuff in that wagon? Just supplies? Really?      I think Ramsays about to get Trojan horsed hard. Rickon I hope kills Ramsay and the Karstarks get murdered. Shaggy Dog I bet is still alive and hiding. Thats probably just a huge ass wolf or something I dont know.       Or maybe Im wrong. By god I hope Im not. I doubt I could stomach Ramsay Bolton being the winner in the North.  ,gameofthrones,d2y9n51,3,t5_2rjz2

7531448,0,t1_d2y9myj,Melly loses all of her faith and her magic wanes  demonstrated by her resuming her ancient form and Davos finding her wrapped in a blanket sitting by the fire. She performed the ritual all without any faith in her Lord and it still worked. Which to me demonstrates that it was done with just magic. Thoros didnt have any faith the first time he did it to Beric but the magic still worked.I also submit Tyrions trial by combat. Tyrion was innocent yet with Oberyns defeat the gods have made their will known. We all knew this judgement was outright incorrect. Purely a judgement by men  had the gods actually made their will known Oberyn would have been yelling about rape at a corpse instead of getting his head liquefied.Finally a realworld example During WW a Polish rabbi goes to his temple for mass and finds it empty. Contemplating the lack of attendance he hears a train not far away. Knowing it to be full of his people going to their death he curses God for allowing it to happen asking why He doesnt intervene. The rabbi then realizes he could have done something about it himself and in that has a revelation we are the hands of God. We spread His message and do His work while interpreting coincidences and happenings as miracles or spites because of our faith not in ourselves but in imagined deities.Theres this belief in both Westeros and the real world that deities guide our lives when really everything that happens is guided by mere mortals. In Westeros some of those mortals live for centuries and do magic with fire or are kept alive by the power flowing through the roots of a magical tree.Disclaimer I do apologize for the obviously aethiestbiased argument but its the best I could come up with to explain my stance.,gameofthrones,d2yaetr,15,t5_2rjz2
7531466,0,t3_4ii25u,If anything Ollena will be forced to work with Cersei and the Lannisters to get Margaery amp Loras back. With the help of Jamie and the kings guard along with Tyrell forces they will demand to take Margaery and Loras back. This will probably fail however as Margaery will be set free by the high sparrow out of spite for Cerseis little sharade that caused the death of the faith militant members at the hands of zombie clegane. Setting Margaery free will ease tensions between the faith and the crown to allow time for both trials of Loras and Cersei to begin and lets remember Cersei confessed and Loras did not. Loras will be found innocent and Cersei already confessed therefore she will be found guilty the punishment being death. she will demand a trial by combat and we can only cross our fingers to know what will happen then.,gameofthrones,d2yahh5,1,t5_2rjz2
7531508,0,t3_4ihos7,I agree with this theory for one reasonIf Umbers were that worried about Wildlings they would have supported Stannis as soon as he help protecting the wall from it. It is known that Stannis contacted every house in the north and they remained loyal to Starks. Stannis also had the extra point for having Ned Starks support so even if the Umbers hate Robb they would still have plenty of reason to join Stannis army.Not sure about Karstark but I would say the same. Wouldnt know how supporting Boltons would be better for then than supporting Stannis.If Im wrong likely I would say that his is completely messed up from DampD. It would be clearly an attempt of give power to Ramsey which he has none. Basically since Ep  no other house supported Boltons cause and the whole realm think they are traitors. The betrayed Robb they betrayed the Lannisters they betrayed the Freys. Nobodys on their side. So if giving Northens houses to him is just an attempt to fix the mistake from previous episodes this is fucked up.EDIT Typing error,gameofthrones,d2yanni,17,t5_2rjz2

7533098,0,t1_d2ygejg,I figure this is pretty likely. Ramsay may know his shit when it comes to dogs but he mostly knows about hunting hounds not wolves or wolflooking dogs. He could probably describe his best hounds pedigree back  generations but I think a large wolf would be enough to fool him. Consider as far as I recall hes never seen a real dire wolf and hes definitely never seen Shaggydog.I think this is especially true since he thinks hes hot shit. He thinks hes untouchable and cunning and terrifying and smarter than any hick from north of Winterfell which means hell be blind to how catastrophically fucked hell be when the time comes.,gameofthrones,d2yh5f4,2,t5_2rjz2

7533501,0,t1_d2yia5j,From the wikiDawn is the ancestral greatsword of House Dayne whose wielder is always given the title Sword of the Morning. Dawn is largely the reason for House Daynes fame. Its origins are lost to legend but it seems likely that the Daynes have carried it for thousands of years. It is said to be made from metal forged from the heart of a fallen star. The blade is as pale as milkglass looking like no Valyrian blade yet sharing all of the properties being incredibly strong and sharp. Unlike other houses who have ancestral swords House Dayne does not pass its sword from lord to lord. Only a knight of House Dayne who is worthy can wield it. The name of the Daynes castle Starfall and their arms featuring a white sword and falling star both reference Dawn. ,gameofthrones,d2yissq,1,t5_2rjz2

7534000,0,t3_4ijmuw,Theres several good videos on youtube about this.The fight at the Tower of Joy is at the end of Roberts rebellion.  Rheagar is dead the Mad King is dead Rheagars wife and children are dead.  Ned took a bunch of his pals to the Tower because thats where Rheagar had stashed Lyanna before getting himself killed.  The two guys outside were Kingsguards Arthur Dayne and...not Arthur Dayne not important.  Ned expresses surprise that theyre here and werent at the Trident where Rheagar was killed or at Kings Landing and they tell him that they were ordered there by Rheagar.  This of course feeds the whole theory that Lyanna is giving birth to Rheagars son who assuming they were married which I would think they were if Kings Guard are there is now the heir to the throne.According to the official story Ned finds Lyanna in a bed of blood and she dies extracting a promise from him.  The theory is that shes just given birth to Jon Snow and begs Ned to protect him.  Ned left Kings Landing pissed off at Robert for condoning the murder of Rheagars other children so he knows that the kid wont live long if he finds out who he is so he takes Jon as his own.,gameofthrones,d2ykuhb,4,t5_2rjz2

Again it makes since that this would be the reason but we still dont know how dragon glass or Valyrian steel is made. I think that Valryian steel having a connection to dragons makes since because Valyria had the most dragons in the worlds history but was there ever a mention of dragons even being in Westeros before the Targaryan invasion? How would the First Men acquire dragon glass if dragons were necessary for it to form?

Also using  swords allowed for longer blocking as with a shield you can literally only block within arms reach which is dangerously close for a v. Also one block with a shield leaves the rest of you exposed so rotating the blades to deflect the strikes means less force absorbed by Daynr and thus he can continue much easier than if he were absorbing all the force with a shield.,gameofthrones,d31qqu0,2,t5_2rjz2

7578575,0,t1_d33hi3e,Seriously  all thisgt Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldnt get used to it though Id been staring at him all afternoon. His skin white despite the faint flush from yesterdays hunting trip literally sparkled like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded into the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass his shirt open over his sculpted incandescent chest his scintillating arms bare. His glistening pale lavender lids were shut though of course he didnt sleep. A perfect statue carved in some unknown stone smooth like marble glittering like crystal. Just to say Edwards skin sparkled.,gameofthrones,d33nbvk,1,t5_2rjz2

7581140,0,t1_d33uavb,you are bending over backwards here. your argument hey there could have been some other kick to the head doesnt hold water from a story telling perspective. they had to deliberately put the scar on the young actors head and choose to show him speaking. why show that he has clearly been kicked only once that left a major scar yet that wasnt the kick that fucked up his speech? that would mean they went to all the trouble of making a fake scar to put on two different actors that doesnt have anything to do with the story.the much more believable theory is that the scar was placed there initially to give us the impression of an origin as simple as a horse kick specifically so they could pull the rug out from under that theory  exactly the way they did.no they have quite clearly shown that he didnt lose his speech to a horse kick.,gameofthrones,d33xstb,1,t5_2rjz2
7581178,0,t1_d33xstb,I dont agree. This author in particular likes to mess with our expectations. I can easily see a scene where old Nan or someone comes running in saying He got kicked in the head by a horse! and another character replying Again?!. ,gameofthrones,d33xyes,0,t5_2rjz2

7588127,0,t3_4j57tf,I do cheer for the Stark family but Ive had the same thought about how lucky their family has been when considering LSH. She thought she lost her husband oldest son two youngest sons Arya was completely missing and assumed dead or capturedtortured leaving only Sansa to be married to Joffrey. All this pushed her over the edge. But really its just Ned and Robb. Sure they were both important to her but in comparison it could have been a lot worse. I was hoping to see her at some future date having a reunion of sorts and seeing Sansa Arya Bran and Rickon all together and happy GoT version of happy surely they have issues and thinking maybe she should have toned the vengeance bit down a notch.,gameofthrones,d34qead,1,t5_2rjz2
7588269,0,t1_d34n60o,I do think that Osha is ultimately going to sacrifice herself to save Rickon. Considering her first appearance was her trying to kill andor kidnap Bran back in S and soon becoming a protector of sorts of the last two Stark boys or at least thats what I think she is now its been a while I think it would be fitting to see her trying to protect them to the end. On the other hand this is Game of Thrones so shell probably just get tortured and killed by Ramsay for funsies. ,gameofthrones,d34qz6q,15,t5_2rjz2

Considering every other Lannister she met at that point had been a raging ballbag it probably made for a refreshing change for her. ,gameofthrones,d361553,11,t5_2rjz2

Thats what I really like about him. He knows his limits. If the job is manipulating people he does it best but when it comes to leading an army he does not overestimate his capabilities and goes for the best candidate he can control.

No doubt Nakloz was a nasty guy let me tell you he was a nasty guy and said nasty things but that sort of reputation for being a bad dealmaker who acts in bad faith is part of what has caused so much hatred and mistrust of Daenarys by the traditional rulers of those free cities. Barristan warned her that too much heavyhandedness would be problematic  after all King Aerys reign was a disaster that turned normal Westerosi against their ruling family and sure enough it seems like many regular Mereenese are indeed becoming more sympathetic to the Sons of the Harpy. How will those onthefence people feel when they see their dragon queen return with higher energy Dothraki? Everyone in Essos knows the Dothraki and what theyre about  feel like shes really raising the stakes. I hope maybe she has them change their ways but I digress.

7620480,0,t1_d37j453,. How were the Khals to suspect she would dump the braziers on the ground and ignite the place? Sure it seems obvious since youre watching the show but to them? Unlikely.. So when a tent made out of combustible materials is burning your first instinct is to kill the person who set it on fire? Really? I dont know about you but my first instinct would be to get the hell out. Honestly who would stay in a burning tent and waste their lives killing an arsonist instead of getting out and dealing with her later?. No one noticed because they killed the guards quickly and gtfo before anyone could see them. And there could be no other people for many reasons. The writers only have so much time per episode they cant spoon feed you the details of each scene. . It is possible to do things silently you know?. Of all the things to whine about you chose the most ridiculous one. Call for Drogon? Because one deus ex Drogon wasnt enough?

7620791,0,t3_4jp3v0,It gets on my nerves when people reduce those scenes to just tits even jokingly because they are such powerful moments for those characters.  And it is really interesting how they contrast.  In the first season Dany was first stripped naked as a way to show her powerlessness against Viserys and Drogo then at the end of the season her clothes were burned away while she was displaying the tremendous power shed discovered in herself.  This happened again this season when she was first stripped naked as a way to show her assumed powerlessness against the khalasar and dosh khaleen and again her clothes were later burned away when she rediscovered her power.  In Cerseis case shed always used her body as a weapon to gain power first by marrying Robert then later by sleeping with Lancel so she could have the king killed.  Once Robert was dead though she couldnt use her body against her children in the same way.  Younger prettier women were around for them they were better armed.   Eventually the weapon shed been using was turned against her when she was forced into an engagement with Loras and again when she was forced to walk naked through the streets.  First Cersei fucked the king then she fucked herself and eventually Cersei got fucked.  In short Dany went from having sexuality used as a weapon against her to using her own sexuality as a weapon while Cersei went from using her sexuality as a weapon to having it used as a weapon against her.  Fucking love it. ,gameofthrones,d38g016,30,t5_2rjz2

7623233,0,t1_d38ivr6,Right. Especially given that there were no real strings attached. On a practical level the masters could literally do nothing to abolish slavery and well be at the same place in seven years. They just dont really have much of a reason to fund the Sons of the Harpy. There isnt much of a choice for Danys crew though.Itll be interesting to see how Dany handles it.

At that point in the story I could her being  wins  assists by Drogon.Either way... I did not expect her to get Jorah to lock them in the hut and then burn it down.

The contrast to Dany after last episode with her literally fiery determination  he still remains rather timid and humbled by death.

7636894,0,t3_4jwpmt,Its not that she has a right per se but she does have a claim to the Iron ThroneAs Varys once said Power resides where men believe it resides. If Dany lands her army of Dothraki and Unsullied its going to shift the balance of power in Westeros. The armies of Westeros are weakened from the War of the Five Kings. Many Houses will immediately pledge support to Dany bolstering her forces and weakening her opponents. Some will do it out loyalty to the House Targaryen. Others out of fear of annihilation. Others will do it just out of spite for the Lannisters or whatever House they dont like who sides with the Crown. This is the ultimate source of her claim. Shell have the power to take the Iron Throne. Her name gives her claim similar to how the Stark name gives Sansa a claim to Winterfell.

I see no more time for the battle for the throne. i really do believe that we are going to move at  what will seem to us like lightening speed now. i could be totally wrong and so that would change who survives and who wins. i see Dorne Freys Lannisters Tyrells and Mereen done for this season both story lines and fight for throne.

7652513,0,t1_d3bwmp8,Pasting this here from other thread to outline other points about Winterfell. gtWinterfell began as the First Keep which despite appearing mundane required the skill of Bran the Builder and giants to construct. The First Keep has an enormous crypt buried deep beneath it and it was specifically built over hot springs. Its construction occurred just after the Long Night ended and the Others were defeated.It would be a perfect place to imprison a God of Ice. And the saying there must always be a Stark in Winterfell could be related to the magic holding the Icelord at bay.Also the name Winterfell could be where Winter fell Where the God of Winter was defeated and subsequently imprisoned.Also Jon and other Starks has nightmares of the crypts and is afraid of something down there that isnt the statues of past kings which Ned says are built to keep evil spirits in checkAll in all I think the Crypts of Winterfell are likely imprisoning the God of Winter the Great Other Hodor. The only problem is that the TV series hasnt included many of these clues which would make the reveal slightly less substantial and more of a random curveball to most viewers.,gameofthrones,d3c1qpv,13,t5_2rjz2

7672721,0,t1_d3dya17,We see their actions which we think are driven by evil. Yet we dont know their motivation. My theory is that The Others were also involved in The Pact between The Children of the Forest and the First Men.  The others were given the land above the wall yet Wildlings and Ranger expeditions have encroached into the Others territory.  They are simply protecting their own land from the humans.  I think the first part is very plausible and this is where I start looking ahead a little more.  I think The Children of the Forest and The Others will team up against the humans and Bran will have to pick a side of the conflict knowing everything about the history. I think Bran helps the Children of the Forest and Others which would make that war even more interesting.,gameofthrones,d3ecdk8,29,t5_2rjz2

7687875,0,t1_d3g1zfp,The First Men acquired these powers from the Children of the Forest. Those were the ones who adopted the faith of the Old Gods. If Bran prevented the First Men from invading the lands of the CotF the events that led to the existence of The Others would not come to be thus the timeline would not happen. You cannot prevent events from happening  even Bloodraven said so. Because they have happened when youre at the point when you could prevent them from happening. In that timeline it cannot be reversed. If Bran is the Builder as I believe he is then its because at a point in the future where he has mastered his powers he goes back in time and becomes Bran the Builder.Think of Interstellar and how Cooper realizes that he was the one in the past that set the events of him going to space in motion allowing him to contact his daughter in the future to save mankind. He had to do it because it had already happened.Similarly I think that Bran does what he does in the past because those events have happened and cannot be reversed. He set everything in motion himself until the moment in the near future where the Others can be defeated for good and until then the timeline cannot be reversed or changed. This is a whole where prophecies happen and things that were foretold come to be because theres no other way around it.Bloodraven knows this probably because Bran himself told him at some point in the past  or that the knowledge from Future Bran had been passed from generation to generation of Greenseer since the time of the First Men when Bran passed his story to the first one.,gameofthrones,d3g2a27,1,t5_2rjz2

Also if that is the case maybe the time period when he started descending into madness is of some importance with the WW and NK.

But they did. Because just like every other character in GoT theyre fair game for death.Honestly shocking mrw LSH is fucking stupid and a totally independent arc? Are you fucking high right now? You realize she closes Briannes story and more than likely Jamies in the books right? They dont chop off pieces of the plot in the show? Doran Martell would like a word with you. Or Strong Belwas.

The Bloodstone Emperor not only practiced torture but also dark arts necromancy. He enslaved his own people took a tigerwoman for wife feasted on human flesh and cast down the true gods of Yi Ti to worship a black stone that fell from the sky.    Both took a nonhuman wife ruled as a tyrant sacrificedworship to someonesomething considered evil or wrong committed atrocities.    The Long Night  gt According to Westerosi legends in the midst of this darkness a race of apparent demons called the Others emerged from the uttermost north of Westeros the polar regions of the Lands of Always Winter.  gt Other legends from the Further East including Yi Ti state the Blood Betrayal began the Long Night. The Lion of Night was unleashed upon the world after the MaidenMadeofLight turned her back on it.    Essosi legends has Azor Ahai wield Lightbringer to beat back the darkness while Westerosi legends have the Last Hero. There is some speculation on connections between them but nothing proven.

7691456,0,t3_4koh7u,My guess is . in the scene that depicts the turning of the baby.  Goes up to  with the baby.  Minus three courtesy of Sam the Slayer Jon Snow and Meera.However this is a pretty far reach for a guess.  We know that Craster sacrificed multiple sons to the walkers and that some or all of them were turned.  Now we never get hard data on Craster but given that he has at least two generations of DaughterWives on the go it seems like hed be able to generate more than  over his long life Not counting the nights king and his bride in this because they are ooooold.  He mentions somewhere that he had  sons but we havent seen anything to confirm that yet and its an easy boast for a man like him as well as not being consistent with the amount of female children he had.That also assumes that all of the White Walkers with the exception of the king and queen were killed off during their first defeat at the hands of Bran the builder and Joramund.Damn now that I write it out I am even less sure.However it seems fairly clear they have a class system of some kind.  Of the  White walkers weve seen there is one king one queen and then there are only three others that ride horses who appear to be the generals  highest status of the .  So that leaves some kind of Royalty King and Queen gt Nobility Horse back riders gt Upper Class the  other white walkers from the turning scene gt Peasants the reanimated wights who arent walkers system .,gameofthrones,d3ggwei,1,t5_2rjz2

7693778,0,t3_4kplkq,I agree. And I also agree that there seems to be a ton of confusion. From what I see people are confused about the idea that the Bran that we see in the visions of the past is his projected consciousness. He didnt change anything by warging Hodor. He had to warg to present Hodor through past Hodor because thats where his consciousness was. He didnt warg past Hodor he warged present Hodor. He cant warg people in the past and fuck with the past he can only warg their consciousness from the past and fuck with the present.,gameofthrones,d3gqecl,0,t5_2rjz2

7695461,0,t1_d3gwwge,being given the memories is what made him a simpleton it makes perfect sense really.Bran warging into him through time and space broke his mind because he received a message that he wasnt supposed to enact in that moment but something in the future because Bran knew he needed to effect the present.Hodor knowing what he has had to do the whole time is the only logical conclusion whether or not he had the mental fortitude to understand that thats for him to know and us to speculate Bran gave Hodor a mission through time and space to protect himself.This happenstance has much more precedence than people seem to understand. This doesnt just show us how Hodor came to fruition it shows us that Fate and Destiny most definitely are real within the world of Planetos.

7700747,0,t1_d3hipdz,OK fuck that. The reason this show has been better than other shows is because its just a show has never been an acceptable answer to anything. Everything that has happened has had an inuniverse explanation that made sense until this season. Summers death could have been done much better and actually had an impact and still been a metaphor. And the problem with hodor dying isnt with the characters its with the writers. They wrote Into a corner there because although its totally in character for hodor to sacrifice himself that sacrifice wont accomplish anything with tens of thousands of tireless fast Wights chasing a teenaged girl carrying a cripple through unfamiliar territory in a blizzard. And accusing me of nitpicking is basically just admitting that these are mistakes. These types of mistakes Didnt start happening until now. I didnt suddenly get higher standards for this show. The show set high standards for itself by being excellent for several years and now its pretty regularly failing to meet those standards.,gameofthrones,d3hivbk,0,t5_2rjz2

The Mad King slowly descended into paranoia and insanity over decades as a result of several complex interwoven influences.

7708733,0,t3_4kt746,If Bran actually is Bran the Builder here is a scenario this obviously only works if he is Bran the Builder.  Now the White WalkersWights possibly have a way into Westeros since the magic of the cave could be linked to that of the Wall.  Logically Bran heads to Winterfell to connect to the nearest known weirwood tree.  He might have only built the wall in the first place but now knows that the wall has or will fall and builds Winterfell as another stronghold to fend off the undead army.  If that comes under seige only he knows the secrets of the place and can escape.  He then can reconnect to another weirwood tree to influence the build of Storms End as noted above that can be held long enough for Danys dragons to help defeat the Nights King.  This is similar to the movie Edge of Tomorrow whereby Bran is constantly going back in time to get defenses built ahead of the advancing army.  Obviously people would say that Winterfell and Storms End have always been there but the same is being said about the Wall.,gameofthrones,d3ifjg7,3,t5_2rjz2

Hed be one of the Big  players in fulfilling one of the three prophecies between Last Hero AA and PTWP. If hes also the the voice that guideswargs into Bran the Builder then hes already made all the difference in the world of Westeros to help place a Wall. Without him men would have been wiped out by WWs long ago in that case. I think he just leads to clarity for the viewer and for people in his time to understand how to fulfill the prophecies. I dont think he decides whether Jon Dany or whoever else to succeed in the other  prophecies but I think hes crucial in providing them clarity.,gameofthrones,d3iggj0,1,t5_2rjz2

7709304,0,t1_d3i8nx6,Thats true. There are ways to suss out the situation though before going straight to the Tullys like maybe doing some spying etc. And she should really have shared with Jon that the intel came from Littlefinger and what kind of a person he has proven himself to be. Never mind all his speeches in earlier seasons about chaos being a ladder and the like. Why would she trust his info at face value? Either they are trying to depict her as still very naive though taking her power back or its bad writing.edit Also sending away her sworn protector who is extremely powerful in battle as well as having an acute perceptiveness of others motives is potentially disastrous. Especially with Ramsey after her. Who knows what the creep would do he could decide he doesnt need legitimacy via a Stark heir anymore and Sansa could meet a horrific end. In fact he has Rickon  who is next in line if Sansa is dead so even more reason just to get rid of her altogether. ,gameofthrones,d3ihvm8,3,t5_2rjz2

This might help you put into perspective just how big Westeros is For scale Britain is about  miles long. Not even including the travel from The Eyrie to a port and then from Eastwatch to Castle Black he is going to be spending at minimum a solid week at sea.gtHighballing the distance the average horse can travel in a day puts it at about  miles a day. From the Eyrie to Hearts Home will probably be about  days. Eastwatch to Castle Black will probably be about  to  days accounting for the slowed speed from the coldsnow. The ship to Eastwatch is going to take them a minimum of  days.

This isnt the case for most fights and during a war where everyone is fighting around you you are more likely to get killed because of it. Armor slows you down but it offers great protection.Bronn isnt stupid thats why he didnt wouldnt fight Sandor on Tyrions behalf.Yes in v where you are better and have a good strategy it is probably possible. But for most cases this isnt going to be a good idea and the armored knight will likely just win.. Not an exact example but look at what happened to Syrio vs Trant.

I think your issue is that you are looking at a boy having a seizure and can explain away his flinching and mimicking of dying Hodors movements as something that can be explained by a seizure. In doing so you are ignoring the editing. When a zombie claws Hodors stomach boy Hodor moves his arm to his stomach. As he lies on the ground he mimics the holding back of the door.He is shouting Hold The Door.gt Why doesnt Hodors character ever show any behavior that suggests hes traumatized by this experience?Apart from only being able to say the word Hodor you mean?gt Wheres his apprehension towards doors or really anything that resembles that situation? Not only did I not say he remembered his experience I specifically said that was open to debate. Personally I doubt he remembered. That being saidgt He isnt afraid of dark cramped passageways.If you look at the scene again you will notice he started holding the door outside. He died a painful death outside.gt Hes afraid of loud noises and fighting in general.He died after being violently attacked with people screaming at him and a doors wood being loudly shattered around him. gt If his character had shown any fears of anything resembling his death Id also would have come to your conclusion.You sure about that?,gameofthrones,d3l2hg0,1,t5_2rjz2

7732639,0,t3_4l864p,A few issues with this theory.A. Roberts rebellion lasted approximately a year. So Im thinking somewhere in the range of  months. So if Ned came and rescued Lyanna at the tail end of the war she should have given birth two months prior.B. Lyanna wasnt very attracted to Robert. In fact by the time Lyanna was kidnapped Robert had already fathered a bastard up in the Vale. Lyanna knew that Robert loved her but she also knew that he wouldnt be faithful to her. She was basically going to do the Tully thing and marry him out of duty rather than love. The idea that she would enter into consensual relations with him is a little farfetched I think.C. It should be noted that Jon apparently has dark brown hair and not the typical jet black Baratheon hair that all of Roberts bastards have. Now to get a little tinfoily. Out of Ned and Cats  children only one of them has Stark features. So we can say that Tully genes are stronger than Stark genes. And we also know that Roberts children all have a very distinct hair color regardless of the mother. So if we want to think of Stark genes as weak and Baratheon genes as strong I think it would make more sense for Jon to have many more similarities with Robert than Lyanna. I do know that genes work waaaay differently in real life but GRRM has seemed to simplify it down to the fact that children usually strongly resemble and inherit the traits of only one parent primarily. So with Stark genes being weak and Baratheon genes being strong one would think that Jon would look like Gendry and Renly instead of a true Stark.D. If Jon was Roberts bastard why would Ned keep that from him. Robert would almost assuredly legitimize Jon and he would grow up to be a prince and eventual king that could connect both the Iron Throne and the North like Robert and Ned always wanted. Instead Ned besmirches his otherwise immaculate reputation to keep Jons true identity a secret. ,gameofthrones,d3l59yp,2,t5_2rjz2

7759637,0,t3_4lkdc8,gt Besides confirming White Walker magic  Old God magic it also confirmed the Greenseers can change the past.I like the theory however I think both of those points are debatable  We know Children of the Forest created the first White Walkers. However thats just part of a bigger story in which somehow for some reason the Walkers turned against them and we have no idea about any of that. We also dont know that the first Walkers had the full extent of powers the current ones do. Perhaps there is a single explanation for both for example perhaps the first Walkers were nearly invincible in combat  as current ones are  but not able to raise and command the dead. Then some great evil corrupted them turning them against the Children and giving them additional powers at the same time.  We actually dont know greenseers can change the past there are still multiple interpretations of the Hodor scene. Consider this option Jojen saw his death well before it happened and so did Hodor. Jojens seizures looked much like Hodors seizure as well. Therefore perhaps Hodor is simply a greenseer like Jojen with the difference that Jojen was strong enough to stay sane after seeing his death while Hodor was not. In this theory Bran didnt cause Hodor to be Hodor he just witnessed it happen in the past.,gameofthrones,d3o7lro,2,t5_2rjz2
7759735,0,t1_d3o5j2p,In addition it will also follow the general arc of the other Stark kids where they left home faced tragedies learnt new skills and then came back. Like Jon considering him a Stark for now left faced deaths of Lord Commander Mormont Ygritte became a leader and is now going back Sansa left was tortured learns through observation from Littlefinger at least in the books and will now go back Bran loses his legs explores his warging abilities and is now fleeing probably heading South.So Arya going to Braavos and learning how to change faces and fight and kill before coming back makes sense. Like you said Needle and her wolfdreams will ensure that she never COMPLETELY becomes no one. She will just become more ruthless than she was before but she will definitely take Needle back with her when she goes to Westeros.Although Im not sure when that will happen. She might or might not kill the actress I dont think she will but theyve been dragging the Waif beats Arya up again for too long so I think she might be heading to Westeros in this season.As for returning to square one  no because her insisting that she wants to become no one is also her practising how to lie. Where before she got by on guts and a fair amount of luck and cleverness now shell actually have the skills to survive she will also know when to control herself and not act impulsively how to use all her senses blindness etc.She will be a VERY changed person but more Arya than No one when she goes back.,gameofthrones,d3o806a,1,t5_2rjz2

I believe DampD also said the ER had sort of queued up visions for Bran to see and the reason he took Bran into that Winterfell season was to hurriedly upload them to Bran before the WWs got in the cave. So maybe Bran is currently stuck in the visions the ER had set up for him until he sees them all? And the next one is Harrenhaal?

I think its an obvious connection people make but I doubt read hope the Hodor wargingchanneling incident was anything more than a onetime thing or else the show risks turning into LOST and enters the murky waters of convoluted timetravel territory.Importantly Hodors name and affliction were a mystery and long foreshadowed by GRR Martin.There is no mystery to the Mad King there is a wellestablished genetic history of mental illness and inbreeding among Targaryens as well as medieval monarchs.  A strong influence of GoT is the War of the Roses in which King Henry VI suffers from mental illness which leads to a dynastic struggle between the Yorks and the Lancasters.He too like the Mad King died of an affliction known as getting stabbed by a sword.Neither requires a supernatural explanation theyre both poignant stories on their own.  To heap a Brandon flashback into altering the timeline causing him to say burn them all would be extremely poor writing and rather disappointing.Then again build me  ships.  how many ships would it take to carry my army? .,gameofthrones,d3ot4rd,4,t5_2rjz2

7765164,0,t1_d3op7tb,It was a reasonable move in the short term for the reasons you listed but also one that is bad in the long term.He just gave even more power to a dangerously psychotic fanatic  someone you can never control no matter how much money or power or morality you appeal to him with.  Hes more dangerous than even Joffrey was because at least Joffrey wore his sadism on his sleeve and just acted like a selfish child.

Message or not the viewers havent really enjoyed her stay in Braavos much and really going there getting beaten up constantly and then dying there just doesnt make sense to me.Basically all Im saying is she may or may not die and it may or may not be because of her desire for revenge and her tokill list and the Faceless Men may or may not be behind her death but I dont think it will happen now.,gameofthrones,d3p0o16,2,t5_2rjz2

Danny burning the Khals and taking control of the Dothraki is her embracing Fire and Blood.Basically before she was saying to her dragons Keep quiet dont burn people just be a obedient gentle creature. And thats denying them their nature as dragons and Drogon rebelled.Now shes telling him Hear me and burn my enemies!Or perhaps in a more primal sense The dragons accept Danny and possibly her inner circle as part of their pack.

It really seemed like she was going through hard times and it would temper her into a fine leader. It hasnt gone that way though. She hasnt struggled since she took her Khalassar through the desert. Its like the longer she spends playing at ruler the more she forgets about how she got there. Shes settled into this I should lead because its my right nonsense and bears almost no resemblance to the Daenerys that I wanted to see succeed.Perhaps thats the point though. Perhaps its to show that power corrupts and that now the things that shes been through are so far in the distant past shes turning into another pampered noble who believes the world owes them what they have and more.

I know we love Arya The Mega Vengeance Ninja but I think with the faceless men shes learned weirdly to be more circumspect about death. She knew the actress didnt deserve to die. She also knew that Cersei must on some level be human and have hurt in the same way Arya has hurt. She obvs still hates Cersei and probably wants to kill her but it was humanising. I think Arya has learned to be more strategic and balanced in the way she thinks about death. Shes no longer the wild little ball of fury...

7773379,0,t1_d3opfbn,Naw most of Westeros is under agnaticcognatic primogeniture Dorne being an interesting exception being absolute cognatic. There are a few titles in play here  House Lannister Lord of Casterly Rock Warden of the West. All three passed to Cersei being the only inheritable child of Tywin.As a dynastic title House Lannister passes automatically from Cersei to Jamie now that he is inheritable again. Casterly Rock was granted to Kevan Lannister Devan Lannister in the book but it looks like Kevan and Devan were merged in the show by Cersei and remains with him until he dies or abdicates and Warden of the West is either attached to the Westerlands as a kingdomlevel title held by Kevan or a titular title appointed by Tommen which could be anyone but probably someone at Casterly Rock since Kevan is serving as Hand. Wed have to look to the Boltons to see how that works. Did Tommen make them Warden or did they just usurp it when they took over Winterfell? Did Ramsey automatically become Warden?,gameofthrones,d3prqup,12,t5_2rjz2
7773497,0,t1_d3pk4gj,Yes. I was just trying to put into words the thoughts in your last paragraph. The WW make all the nonsense going on in KL seem even more petty and ridiculous. In KL Cersei has her panties in a bunch about everything and is still mad she had to walk naked through he cityand in the North we have John who was actually murdered and who has fought reanimated corpses on a murderous rampage. Can you imagine Tommen faced with a WW? Could he have killed it like Sam the Slayer? Dubious. But I bet Tyrion could have. I feel like there are so many more insights to be made from this comparison but Im too sober to put these thoughts into words. If those in KL were to acknowledge the threat of the WW amp wights they would have to acknowledge how stupid their game of thrones is.

Sam wasis an anxious kidperson who freezes up under pressure. The cure to this is not putting more hard ass inspired pressure on him. The cure instead is having a person like John Snow who is patient calm and stern at times work with him to act under pressure. Having a hard ass scream at you while you are frozen up is never going to work for kids like Sam. It ends up being paradoxical and makes them more afraid and anxious which makes them freeze up more.

7799807,0,t1_d3sqm0b,Spoilers for the episode aheadWell in the episode he explains that his band of rangers he led north was ambushed by white walkers and they all were killed except him he was stabbed by one of their ice blades and left for dead. The children took him and gave him the same treatment they gave the original white walker stabbing him into white walkerhood. They havent expanded on this yet but I think its safe to say that in the shows history the original white walkers either werent crazy so much as controllable or werent immediately just zombies or maybe you need to be killed by one of the ice blades to become the zombiestyle white walker. Anyway he isnt a zombie but he isnt human anymore either.So hes spent the last several years north of the wall alone just trying to survive in the most hostile territory in Westeros.Now as far as the books go we dont know yet. He went missing north of the wall and is still KIA as far we the characters know. Its a pretty strong theory that hell come back especially with the show backing it but we dont know for sure yet.,gameofthrones,d3srcbb,12,t5_2rjz2

Filming is done in a very limited amount of time and out of order if using multiple locations.  Trying to portray Sam losing weight consistently and gradually would have been very difficult.  His weight would bounce around depending on the scene and there would probably be a pretty jarring moment where he clearly lost lbs out of nowhere.  Sams weight is as iconic as Jons hair at this point for the show. Its easier just to let him stay the same.That being said I wish they had done exactly what you describe. ,gameofthrones,d3tepbt,2,t5_2rjz2

I actually didnt remember if it was even said who brought her back I just assumed it was thoros since she was with the brotherhood but its been a while since I read ASoS so Ill take your word for it.  I actually just thought you made a typo and said beric instead of thoros lol.  Didnt know berric had the power to do that but I think they made a pretty good point that the resurrections only worked when both thoros and melisandre lost their faith in rhollor.  So its totally plausible that it doesnt even have to do with being a red priestpriestess.  Him being the broken man is definitely plausible in light of that.  Although I thought the showrunners were pretty stern that stoneheart will not be making an appearance?So is berric gone for good then?

7813080,1,t3_4mazk9,A couple of things.Aerys was said to have had a promising start to his reign right? Maybe she is more similar to him than previously thought. Also a lot of things people complain about probably have to do with pacing and to a certain extent therefore also writing. Her speech at the end which echoed Drogos speech was yet another way of hyping her that has been going on quite a lot this season. Did we really need to END the episode with that speech? I felt like it had been better to just have Arya blow out the candle and present the speech at another time perhaps.Because of the pacing her droning on in Mereen forever I feel like it hurts her arc a bit but Gurm has to take some of the blame for that as well since it was originally planned to be a trilogy. I think that is at least part of the reason why it is a bit messed up.Furthermore her becoming the villain isnt necessarily a bad thing since I like villains and antiheroes more than your standard heroes that everyone seems to like. Usually I think the main character tends to be much less interesting than the rest of the cast yet mainstream people hipster glasses on seem to like them for some reason. I just dont get it. On the acting I think Emilia is doing a fine job with what she is given but I disagree with you on some moments being epic or her being particularly awe inspiring. However that is much a matter of opinion. I get that its a TV show and the CGI budget isnt something that can or should be prioritized but her riding away from the arena on a dragon looked very weird but thats just being picky.I used to be a Dany targaryen loyalist supporter early on but some of these decisions have made me unexpectedly gravitate towards the Starks by virtue of the fact that show Sansa is becoming more powerful and that we are learning more about the magic of the Weirwoods and the COTF. Huge sucker for magic especially evil Wizards like Saruman in LotR. The Targaryens and the Starks the North have consistently been my two favorites since they have so much extra development. Being from Finland probably also has something to do with preferring the North. Greyjoys are also looking interesting atm however.Anyway most of your points have a grain of truth in them at least but I certainly see why people are frustrated or turning against her.,gameofthrones,d3u96bq,0,t5_2rjz2

7819732,0,t3_4mdeww,ok this has been pecking at the back of my brain all day. I think I got it. Considering that the crown has to go back up the MaleBaratheon tree and there are no other known living legitimate male Baratheons the line takes us all the way back to the founder Orys. Orys was supposedly a Targaryen bastard so that cuts him out of the line of succession. The crown goes up to his Taragaryen father Aerion and back down to his legitimate brother Aegon the Conqueror!!At some point in time Maegor son of Aerion the Monstrous was passed over for Aegon the Unlikely Egg because they were afraid of the crazy gene being in power again. Technically the line of succession should be from this family. After Maegor Maester Aemon wouldve been next in line he abdicated. Egg was after that and we know how that turned out. So the person with the strongest claim to the iron throne would be Aegon son of Rhaegar if he is alive. yassss,gameofthrones,d3v04dl,1,t5_2rjz2

Logistically its definitely not even possible. If you have a narrow sea connecting the two continents its always going to be the route you take because crossing an ocean thats at best  times this is lowballing it immensely the size of the narrow sea means youd have to bring along  times the supplies. Usually that much of a difference means you need a much larger ship and I dont think anyone is building vessels that large. Why would they when they can just skirt the coast and then cross the narrow sea?Think about Columbus...Those ships were huge and it was a whole fleet yet they still nearly starved and several times nearly mutineered against him.

7827556,0,t1_d3vv2u8,How would every sentence be five times longer? Youre attacking a straw man here. Im not saying that we should make sweeping generalizations about people and then rein them back in with half a dozen footnotes. Im saying that we should stop making such sweeping generalizations. Instead of saying All Chinese eat rice say Rice is a staple food in China or simply Most Chinese eat rice. Either one has the benefit of being more accurate and the latter is even the same length. I dont really see the hardship here to be honest. And as for your doubts about how much our diction matters I think the connection rather obvious. If we all over and over again refer to the Middle East as a nest of murderous nutjobs  all the while implicitly limiting the description to actual terrorists but never saying so  how can we and those who hear us help forming that impression in our minds if only unconsciously? And if we have the pattern of Middle East  ISIS  Evil embedded in our minds how can we avoid having it influence our actions? Generalizations like the ones youre arguing for allow us to sand away the human features of people we dont know. And once theyre all faceless Others its very easy to vote for bombing them all to Hell or banning them from the country or monitoring them in their places of worship. The more we speak of people as individuals rather than groups and the more we limit our classifications the more human other people become. ,gameofthrones,d3vvtzc,2,t5_2rjz2

I cant imagine it was a mistake in directing and I do think its possible that either Cersei or Tommen is going to die at the hands of the Mountain but hes also a member of the Kings Guard and thats essentially a version of the vow that they would all take so I dont know how significant this is in context.ETA Can we also stop using Robert Strong?

7830633,0,t3_4mkrll, GRRM himself has said that Magic has no rules. So therefore there is nothing to explain. The Sansa Rape scene was actually less shocking than what happened in the books. The books had Ramsey rape Jeyne Poole after forcing Theon to perform cunnilingus. The Sansa rape was to show that Ramsey is evil and sadistic and that Littlefinger was wrong for once. It shows how addicted Jaime was to Cersei. He got better the longer he was away but then as soon as he got back he became her puppet again. It happened in the books but not to the same degree before being sent away again. It was only when he was sent away that he actually became the good Jaime we like.As for Sansa shes a novice to the game. She bounces between player and puppet because thats what she is. She isnt a full fledged player  but neither is she a puppet anymore. All your criticisms were valid for the first few seasons. Except now they are killing named characters with significant back stories instead of just nameless babies and traitorous Bannermen. ,gameofthrones,d3w8aze,8,t5_2rjz2

This is evident because he formed his own Church I mean if that isnt megalomania I dont know what is.You wont ever hear me disagree on him being a megalomaniac. To be honest I really hate the dude. However I dont think he wouldve split with the Catholic church if not for his fixation on having a male heir. He wrote the Defence of the Seven Sacraments in  for which Leo X made him Defender of the Faith. He was considered a devout Catholic until they wouldnt let him divorce his wife.

7839589,0,t3_4mg2c2,Alright well Ill throw some thoughts out thereDany returns to mereen flips shit at Tyrion I dont think its going to blow over as easily as people think. Dany might chill for a bit until she sees some slave atrocity and kills the master in an emotional haste before screaming some mother of dragons yada yada but that may be saved for another episode.Bran and co head back to the wall I dont think the wall will actually break but its magic will no longer prevent the white walkers from crossing all well see is them crossing and seeing brans arm glow or something followed by the nights king turning his head ominously. Maybe one more flashback before the big tower of joy one to comeJon and Sansa try and rally some northern houses the north is reminded they dont get much support until Jon is legitimized maybe by Sansa if she can do that or idk and then theyll get the support they needLittle finger will tell Ramsey about Jon and Sansa getting the blackfish causing Ramsey to send his men to the river lands which weakens there hold at winterfellWere probably going to see Dorne again this episode and its going to suckThe river lands is super interesting dont really know whats going to happen there would guess it ends in the death of Walder Frey more than anything else. I feel like its going to parallel the war of  kings with Frays Boltons Lannisters vs Starks Tullys and other northern houses am I forgetting someone important here?Kings landing might not see much action I dont believe clegane bowl is this ep but rather the next one since its  and the mountain killed oberyn in . I think well get pretty much nothing here until the last scene when the high sparrow announces the hound as his champion maybe some shitty Tommen scenes otherwise.Think I covered everything wrote more than I thought I would would love to hear some feedback.P.S. I dont think all of this will happen this episode specifically most of that Dany stuff but rather very soonEDIT oh shit forgot to mention I totally think Theon and co are going to run into Jorah. I just feel like outta everyone the iron born could maybe help cure him.Euron will have his ships ready and set sail thats itProbably no Arya this episode unless they decide not to wait an ep and have the waif try and fail to kill Arya SJ is cool with Arya cuz a death was given to the gods but Arya leaves. I still believe that SJ is Syrio.Ok now Im done,gameofthrones,d3x8k9x,2,t5_2rjz2

7840820,0,t1_d3wilh7,But wouldnt either Tommen or Loras have to volunteer as tribute? IIRC you dont just get to choose your champion. Tommen is probably worse at fighting than Ser Pounce so I cant really see him volunteering to either die if he loses or  execute his mother if he wins. Loras is out of shape for fighting but he may agree to it to see the other side of a damn dungeon. I could see that being much more likely but still dubious. Hopefully its da Hound. ,gameofthrones,d3xdk07,2,t5_2rjz2
7840908,0,t3_4mpzef,Stannis and Jon were allies. When Davos returned to the wall everyone kind of knew he and Jon were buddies. When Jon dies Davos immediately becomes a target and he knows this. It is even mentioned when Aliser is knocking on the door that despite what he says Aliser will not let any of them leave alive. I believe it is Davos that actually says this. At the end of the day I think Davos has a strong moral compass and realizes that Jon is the closest thing to Stannis from his point of view as far as honorrighteousness goes in the area. ,gameofthrones,d3xdwv5,3,t5_2rjz2

7842702,0,t1_d3xkosc,Jon and Sansa travel from house to house we see them experience the different edges to loyalty to the Starks  those who have fought and died for the Starks and will again and those who have and wont again.Arya was making her way home she was seemingly done with this life and ready to go back to her real family. She showed she has skills and seemed almost cheekily happy to show them off flaunting the money she quite clearly stole. She is then attacked and has to escape and this will bring about her presumably fleeing for her life while trying not to bleed to death. It is the start of a story.The Greyjoys have gone halfway across the world to seek out the Dragon Queen who can restore them to what they see is their rightful station. While at the brothel its expunged on how Theon doesnt just escape by leaving the Dreadfort he cant escape whats happening in his mind. His sister is starting to learn that her brother being safe in body doesnt mean thats the case in his mind.Jaime has for the first time since he was a teen been freed of the shackles of the Kingsguard his father and the capital. He is doing what most people hoped he would do  be the heir to his father he was supposed to be. Hes marched an army to retake Riverrun and a man who has won his entire life is once again facing that odd feeling  failure.I think you just want something to complain about truth be told. Everything I just said parallels the things you were trying to say in defence of your stance. Ned didnt arrive misstep and get executed in a single episode. It was stretched out. Jaime showing up at Riverrun doesnt mean nothing is happening and if you think nothing happened this episode I feel like you werent watching to enjoy again you just wanted something to complain about.,gameofthrones,d3xl6ib,6,t5_2rjz2

7842875,0,t3_4mqo0s,Short as fuck episode. Overall very good but probably my least favourite episode so far least favourite still means better than anything else on TV. Im just mildly disappointed by it. No big deal.Seeing Sandor Clegane alive was of course satisfying though. So was the ending. What an efficient way to get him from being a repentant peacenik to a mad dog looking for revenge in one episode. Im hopeful that Cleganebowl will happen but his beef for now is with the Brotherhood and there are three episodes left. Hard to tell where that is going. After three backfromthedeadnotactuallydead reveals Jon Benjen the Hound I dare not to expect a fourth.The Riverrun stuff was a bit underwhelming. The Blackfish was good but Jaime kinda pussied out. Hopefully his moment to shine is coming next episode. I did like the backhand to Black Walder though.Aryas scene annoyed me. They set it up in the last episode like she was going to fight the Waif in the dark and we thought maybe her tedious training scenes would pay off. Nope. Instead we got another surprise stabbing scene those are getting old they really need to think of new ways to kill people and there was almost zero emotional response to it because we know Arya wont die. It just seemed really pointless. Although she did overhear that the Greyjoys have landed in Volantis. If she reunites with Theon she can learn that Sansa Jon Bran and Rickon are all still alive. The Kings Landing stuff was good. I liked both of Olennas scenes. Im intrigued by Margaerys behaviour. I thought she was pretending to be converted because shes got some plan to screw over the High Sparrow. Now it appears she is pretending to be converted but just because shes scared shitless by the High Sparrow and shes doing it to survive. I also feel Cerseis furious fit of rage is imminent. Olenna telling her how she lost brought out the fury in her. She might do some reckless shit now. Some burn them all type shit. The North remains the best part of the show. I loved both the Mormont scene and the Glover scene. I like how Davos negotiated the Mormont alliance like he did with Stannis and the Iron Bank. I also respected Lord Glovers decision strangely enough. Everything he said made sense. You couldnt argue with it. Robb Stark did fuck them over. I like that some Houses still feel some resentment over Robbs stupid decisions and that its not easy for Jon and Sansa to unite the North. Im betting Sansas letter is for Littlefinger. They dont have enough men but he does. Thats going to cause a rift between her and Jon.Overall about a .. Still good but probably my least favourite episode of this season so far.,gameofthrones,d3xlvs0,1,t5_2rjz2

Even shitty storytellers and even brutally deadly storytellers wouldnt do that cause it would literally make no sense and take away from the overall story. Its like saying After James wondered the woods for days a young girl came and saw him dying from hunger and thirst. She brought him to her fathers hut and they nurtured him. He started working for them lived with them for  years until a disease took her fathers life. At this age they were both eligible to marry and did so.

7847777,0,t1_d3xyfvp,Honestly the theory made a lot more sense with the book version in which its a monastery hes theoretically as its a suspicious character in the monastery that seems to be him in so all it would take is the Queen choosing trial by combat and the High Sparrow looking for a champion on their side. I would assume in this one itll have a slightly more lengthy path maybe he gets his revenge on Lemoncloak and then heads South to return to the world and gets caught up in it. Maybe he just sees the star that Brother Ray wore and swears himself to it who knows. Youre definitely on to the main point thoughtheres not many reasons to bring him back without him having a part to play there. ,gameofthrones,d3y5r5f,12,t5_2rjz2

Walked like Jaqen wore hair parted down the middle threw the coin with the right hand Arya is left handed. Was too obvious. Arya would have never asked for a cabin. The money was thrown around too casually even if she was capable of stealing such a sum.. Lingering shot of statue on the bridge maybe sorry to leave. Arya hasnt been there that long doesnt have a particular fondness for the place. Could have stowed away as a cabin boy too easily. Jaqens life belongs to her. He promised her  lives to take for the Red God. He took  then she named him as her rd. Instead of dying he bargained and agreed to help her escape but then when he left he gave her the coin and told her to come to Braavos. And he gave her the words Valar Morghulis all men must die. Knowing what we know about their relationship with death there would have been no bargain really. He believes in deathHis life is owed to the Red God. No bargain can change his fate and he knows it. He willingly dies in Aryas place wearing her face to fulfill the contract on his own life. He also was testing the Waif who did not fulfill the contract correctly by doing a belly wound instead of killing quickly. Waif is going to go out before he is gone officially.

If I cant get behind a writers style by then it just wasnt meant to be.  For instance I know lots of people who rave about R. A. Salvatores writing but I just dont enjoy reading him for whatever reason.   If you want something a little more lighthearted but that was kind of a defining set for fantasy novels you may also want to check out some of the Dragonlance novels by Margeret Weiss et al.  Im not claiming they are grand literary works or anything but Ive always found the books to be well written they flow well and the characters are easy to relate to while being cliche at the same time.  Plus Dragons of Autumn Twilght is under  pages long so it wont take too long to get through if you dont enjoy it.  Id try my other recommendations first for the more gritty and grown up fantasy whereas Dragonlance is more a game of DampD in a book how the series was conceived.Happy reading!,gameofthrones,d3yjjx4,2,t5_2rjz2

Yes giants dont like being stared at and can pound a man into the ground like a hammer on a nail.  Saw that scene as well.  That shit has no bearing on the screenshot I posted.  Those dudes arent averting their eyes.  If youre ashamed or afraid to look at someone you dont stare off blankly at the horizon like fucking blind person.  You stare down at the ground.  Theyd all be looking in roughly the same direction.  Theyre practically staring off in different ordinal directions.  Theyd at least turn their heads towards him so as to listen more carefully if not to look at him outright.

7854677,0,t1_d3yxjav,I dont think he will die at the battle itself.  He will stay to the rear and let the others do the fighting.  He is that kind of chicken.  He picked a mockingbird but is should be a chicken.  He will be dead soon I think.  It may even be Sansa that kills him.  It would be poetic justice if she had the dagger that was meant to kill Bran to kill LF with.  That would be awesome. For the first few seasons I thought Varys was the jerk and LF was just a creepy sex addict but my views have change a lot since reading the books and seeing the events of the last couple of seasons.,gameofthrones,d3yxq4r,1,t5_2rjz2

7856395,0,t1_d3xk38f,Obviously. And theres nothing cryptic about it. She drew the symbol of her house...But as someone else mentioned in this thread it could have been a ploy by the High Sparrow to test Margaerys loyalty.

7857700,0,t3_4mtn2a,From another threadI cant believe that was Arya. At the end of the other episode we see her retrieving her sword hunkering down for the night blowing out the candle hidden. Then shes wandering about in Braavos different clothes different hair no Needle by her side. Chucking money about then taking a stroll across a bridge to take in the view before getting shivved.So this a girl that survived and got out of Kings Landing when the Lannisters and Gold Cloaks searched for her. She disguised herself as a boy and travelled with the Nights wartch survived the Bloody Mummers and being the cup bearer for Tywin Lannister. Shes been trained by the Faceless men FFS. She knows how to hide she knows how to sneak out of cities and why on earth would she wander Braavos openly knowing the Faceless Men would be after her without her sword. So to my mind its definitely NOT Arya unless she just had a massive brain fart.What it did resemble was a trap bait to draw someone out. Jaqens words to the Waif was dont let her suffer and yet she stabs her in the stomach and twists. Thats not a clean kill a quick death stomach wounds kills you slow and painfully. If the Waif was being tested she failed. Not sure who was Arya perhaps another accolyte perhaps Jaqan.If it was Arya then she deserved to get shivved it was just moronic.,gameofthrones,d3z9yhu,3,t5_2rjz2

I know some people who would fastforward through his scenes because they couldnt bare to watch.Yara is Ironborn. They dont coddle people. They fucking drowned their new king. They dont know how to be sensitive and caring so when Yara calls what Theon went through some bad years the audience is supposed to react as Theon did. Shes being ridiculous but so are all Ironborn when it comes to things like that. Theon calls her on it immediately and she apologizes for joking about his disfigurement. Thats practically a mushy family moment for the Greyjoys.I can appreciate the connection youre trying to make but I dont think its a  to  comparison. ,gameofthrones,d3za5ma,29,t5_2rjz2

7858820,0,t1_d3ze9ep,gtIm not sure its reasonable for the show to go through an entire explication of the resurrection each time Jon comes into contact with a character who is learning of it for the first time.The problem I have is they havent even really had a single person outside Castle Black even talk about it. Not even Jon and Sansa having a conversation.I agree it doesnt need to be brought up every time someone new meets Jon but it would be nice if people acknowledged it or at least someone besides the wildlings and the brothers of the watch.Jaime gets acknowledged for being a King SlayerOathbreaker every other sentence with new people.

7860352,0,t1_d3yxauf,Good point  yet thinking on it I do wonder about the rules of marriage in Westeros. After all it seemed the Boltons were fairly aligned with the Lannisters during the period of the Red Wedding but Sansa is now considered to be a traitor. So does each territory honor their own rules of matrimony? Or was it assumed that the SansaTyrion union was automatically forfeit after Joffreys demise?Edit Reading more about it on the web it seems that for the purposes of the show if a marriage is not consummated it isnt considered a marriage. Annulment can only come through the High Septim but apparently her nonunion with Tyrion is what gave Reese claim to wed her.,gameofthrones,d3zkovg,1,t5_2rjz2

7865095,0,t3_4n1mek,So heres my thinking correct me if Im wrong Ramsay has approximately  men at his command.  He also has Rickon if the poor little guy is still alive.  But how well do they know the area and how good are they at fighting in the cold?Jon Snow has the Wildings and WunWun I swear if WunWun goes down Ill die a little inside myself but he also has the potential of a calvary coming in at the last moment  the Knights of the Vale.  Added bonus Ramsay has been gaining enemies at every turn families once loyal or appearing loyal may reconsider their allegiance to House Bolton and its psychopathic leader with Jon and Sansa back in the picture.  And again I truly believe that the Umbers only gave Rickon to Ramsay as a ruse and that Rickon is in on the plan.  House Umber was incredibly loyal to the Starks at one time. Its really the only reason Osha took Rickon there in the first place  Bran suggested it because they could be trusted.  I think many more Houses will rally around Jon and Sansa at the last minute.

Either it wasnt them and isnt them destroying Frey campssupply lines lem and other members have gone rogue or someone else a fan awaited favorite is running the show now.  Thats the only things that make sense to me.  Although If it wasnt them Lem was still pretty dubious and not BWBlike if you ask me.  Its been a while since I read the books or saw him on the show so maybe he was always a prick but the brotherhood I remember from the show were all pretty stand up guys.  He might have been annoyed with arya cuz lets face it she was quite the pain in the ass for him especially in the books I think didnt she like break his nose or something?  But he still seemed not the merry outlaw type and it was obvious that community was no threat or supporting any army.

While Ive been hype for Stoneheart for years now I kind of hope it doesnt happen this season after seeing Brynden Benjen Jon and Rickon come back in various ways already.It could be some kind of petty revenge against the Hound could be religious could be out of hunger.

7873390,0,t3_4n5tij,Ive argued this premise several times in the past. Cerseis prophecy will become true because she makes it happen. The witch had no reason to tell her the truth. Why would she? I dont know how the scene happens in the books but in the show Cersei intrudes on her and the witch tells her to leave and she doesnt. So I think she just messes with her. Its possible that the witch knew exactly what would happen to Cersei and fed her some truths and added lies to make her mistrustful. Or maybe she got lucky based on the fact that Cersei was clearly royal.I agree it would be pretty anticlimactic if the prophecy turns true and Tommen dies before Cersei eventually leading her to be strangled by someone.,gameofthrones,d411i9b,2,t5_2rjz2

7881371,0,t3_4n4rjt,Without any tin foils on. I think this is what happened she probably knew there was no escape for faceless men. So she needed to fake her death. She brought attention to her self and tried to get in a scenario to fake her death. She thought she could escape with a mild wound and survive. But she underestimated the waif and ended up getting stabbed very hard. But the last scene were she is walking the streets bloodied is rather strange. I think there is some significance to walking the streets bloodied where is she going the alternative would be to stay out of sight which is what I would have expected.,gameofthrones,d41xu2g,1,t5_2rjz2
7881396,0,t1_d41x8mb,Well the idea isnt that Water Dancers are all faceless men just him.  Honestly alot of the theory is contingent on there is only one god A Girl knows his name when he never tells her.  This is both an echo of and reliant on Arya remembering Syrio saying there is only one god death to her in their training.  The similarity in wording IS pretty suspicious especially since they were the only two people in the room when he said that. Syrio also died offscreen.  This keeps the possibility that he was still alive open since the squad sent after him would report him dead either way so their claim that he is is meaningless.  The notion that anyone more skilled than a bag of rocks would lose to Meryn fucking Trant when hes surrounded by other weapons to pick up from the soldiers he already beat seems unlikely.  The fact that Syrio would lose a fight where he outskills his opponent that hard is even lapshaded by the Hound which in itself is foreshadowing.Finally Jaqen joined the caravan going north in Kings Landing despite there not really being any high profile targets killed in the city besides the ones killed in the purge of the Starks.  Also the notion that a faceless man would be caught and imprisoned so trivially especially one with the stupid levels of stealthiness and combat ability as Jaqen he wiped out the entire guard at harrenhall without a single one of them so much as getting the alarm out seems bizzare.  This hints that Jaqen was not actually captured but was using the inviolability of the Nights Watch as a means of exiting the Capital.  This makes even more sense if you assume that he did so to remain close to Arya he could leave the city in any number of ways but he chose to go with the watch probably one of the hardest for him to get out of.  He would only do that if he had a specific reason to be with them...,gameofthrones,d41xxq3,4,t5_2rjz2

7886484,0,t1_d4288e7,gt Shes no less than  months pregnant if thats the case. They also havent shown her with any sickness she has definitely had no problem riding a horse and jumping off walls and doing a pretty decent amount of walking.Morning sickness is a very overplayed pregnancy stereotype not all women have it. And from those who do  never throw up most just feel a bit queasy. And even if Sansa did get morning sickness it wouldnt necessarily be shown onscren. When Dany got pregnant she either wasnt sick or it wasnt shown and she was riding the horse into late pregnancy just fine.  months definitely wouldnt be a problem riding let alone walking.I personally dont think shes pregnant just saying that pregnancy isnt always the way its stereotyped to be  like some horrible thing that completely incapacitates the woman. There are many who dont even know theyre  months pregnant. ,gameofthrones,d42ii5m,2,t5_2rjz2
7886614,0,t1_d42irgs,gt which is strange that there were so many faces on that corpse and somehow the corpse managed to change into Aryas face while deadMy interpretation would imply that when someone truly becomes No one they abandon their face entirely and have no true identityface. That every face is an illusion because No one has no face and no identity.gt but theres been no indication that you can wear the face of a living person.again not if you go with the idea that we were shown Aryas face on the faceless mans body. Also not if you consider that the warlocks of Qarth were able to take the form of Pryat Pree.All of that would be evidence that the faces are not a requirement necessarily just the preferred method for the faceless men.

7887660,0,t1_d42mf5s,True weve only seen him murdering people and being Cerseis puppet. We all assume he isnt capable of anything else and so we treat him like a monster. Im saying maybe the hound who is his brother after all may be the only one that knows there is some humanity left he rediscovered his own after all. So at this point he is the only one that has the balls to confront the mountain and try appeal to the mountains better nature. And what if he manages to get through to him in some way  which we all assume isnt possible similar to Luke trying to turn Darth Vader which weve only seen being purely evil. It requires some great writing of course but I think its possible and it makes for an interesting arc for both of them  the hound turns nonviolent in the end fits with brother Rays speech about violence being a disease and the mountain gives up the fight and either lets the hound finish him off or kills himself.,gameofthrones,d42n9iy,0,t5_2rjz2

7924502,0,t3_4nthy1,Wow. What a sea of low effort comments. I personally dont fault the River run scene or the faceless men storyline. Were they flashy and gripping? At times sure but overall it was meant to show more of a personality change. Jaime is no longer using brute force and Arya has developed into more of her own character. Does that mean I cared for this episode? Seven gods no. This was one of the most boring episodes. Easily my least favorite in a few seasons mainly due to the off screen deaths.

7924558,0,t3_4ntdsc,I have a theory.  Personally I think they could be talking about a legitimate heir.  Perhaps now knowing that Tommen has truly betrayed her and is out of her contorl Cersei now plans to get him off the throne.  I know that may sound kind of tin foily but perhaps they are talking about exposing Gendry to the world.  This would in my opinion be a great dramatic way to finally bring Gendry back and make him someone of more importance rather than just a dead plot line.

But no it was just a few bad apples and all is well with the merry men of the forest again. Are we supposed to accept that had those few bad apples not been roaming around in that particular place Ian McShanes pacifist commune would have survived just fine? If so last episodes message about the impossibility of pacifism in Westeros was just negated.We get all of the awesome cinematography surrounding Riverrun but it ends with a weak surrender and the most interesting character in the situation alongside Jaime dying offscreen. Was the purpose of all that to show that Jaime loves Cersei and also likes Brienne? We already knew that. No point at all. Changes nothing.They tease us with some mindblowing shenanigans surrounding Arya and the faceless men but it ends up just being a straightforward clumsy plotline which doesnt advance her character at all. Wasnt she supposed to be smart and brave in the first few seasons? While now shes just reckless and an alright fighter in the dark? Whats been the point?And we get teased with a fullon Mountain vs sparrows massacre but only get him owning one guy. This isnt relevant to the story arcs but its still a disappointment.What needed to happenBrotherhood They become red god ISIS.Arya Her time in Braavos makes her smart and deadly and she returns to Westeros as a weapon instead of...?Blackfish He joins Jon amp Sansa with his troops or dies heroically not betrayed by all of his men  does he really come across as a guy who doesnt inspire loyalty in his soldiers? The guy is badass and has gravitas. Are they really saying that nobody in that castle was loyal to him over an almost Theonated Edmure?Jaime He lets the Tully army escape to the North as a way of showing that hes becoming a more honourable and oath keeping guy and that a bit of Brienne has rubbed off on him. He accepts Oathkeeper from Brienne as his personal sword and having it influences him. He maybe even kills Cersei after she goes mad and completes his transformation into a hero by becoming king. Instead after all of the teased redemption from the past several seasons we get him threatening to kill baby Tully. The only way hes developed is that he overlooks Brienne being his enemy because he has a bond with her.Tyrion He shows hes a capable ruler like he was in Kings Landing instead of playing boring drinking games while he gets totally outmaneuvered by his enemies and waits for goddess Dany to save the day.,gameofthrones,d46z54z,3,t5_2rjz2

The Blackfish just wants a fight the only thing he knows how to do.  Self preservation can be a powerful motivator.

7929071,0,t3_4ntjcl,I liked the Arya storyline a lot. The girl she defeated had brought about her demise by training a blind Arya. Arya couldnt win blind or with vision but when the other couldnt see she gained an advantage. She leaned and grew in this time and became proud of her house. All of this was very satisfying to me. The hounds story seems very abridged. His time at the Sept couldve been longer and more transformative making his return to his old ways more satisfying.

There was literally nothing he could do.As for the Riverlands one Blackfish wanted to let them hang Edmure not Tully soldiers.

Loved The Mountains interaction with The Brotherhood. Thought that was incredibly well done. Loved the JaimeBrienne interaction and the Podother guy interaction. Those were all very well done. Felt the Edmure thing was well done and I was was surprised by it and it had some great tension. Was surprised and saddened by the kings decree and the effect on Cersei.

I cant remember the situation but I recall it being a slap and he said something like you will never do that again.

7931188,0,t1_d47buwg,gt Furthermore with the BlackfishRiverrun all that did was show that Jamie loves Cersei and the Blackfish is dead. The rest is all filler.Totally disagree. Riverrun was a tremendous test for Jaime. He pledged to Catelyn Stark that he would not harm another Stark or Tully yet he was dispatched on a mission to take a castle from the Tullys. The easy way would have been to overrun the castle killing them or most of them in the process. Instead Jaime tried to talk with Blackfish himself then let Brienne talk with Blackfish and finally persuaded Edmure to hand over the castle. Jaime tried every possibility to avoid violence  and in the process aided the Starks by willingly sending them the Tully army. Riverrun was not action packed to say the least. But it was a defining moment for Jaimes character as the series moves into the next Act whatever may be left after the Battle of Bastards.,gameofthrones,d47jgpz,3,t5_2rjz2

7931305,0,t3_4nwnxf,Just based on what we can see in the trailer Wun Wun wrecks shit.  However at about  you can see what I think is Jon and others atop a heap of men that seems far too steep to be a feature of the landscape.  I think thats Wun Wuns overwhelmed corpse surrounded by dozens of Bolton corpses. Despite big losses Jons forces defeat the Bolton vanguard and come up to the Bolton lines.  This is where they encounter the shield wall and start to really get wrecked. As per everyones prediction just as all hope is lost the Knights of the Vale arrive to save the day.   As per everyones prediction I doubt both Tormund and Davos make it.  One of those guys my guess is Tormund goes down. The sullen Jon we see at the end of the trailer is at the end of the battle contemplating gains and losses mostly losses I think.  OTHER SPECULATION Ramsay begins negotiations by either killing Rickon in front of Jon or something equally nasty. Ghost dies. Theres going to be some other twist about Jons victory that we cant see.

The little Bear Island lady looks like shes ready to personally lead her  men into battle.  I dont get that vibe from Sansa.  Jon will be leading that army.  Sansa wants others to fight her battle for her.  She is motivated by revenge and by taking back what is mine.  Jon is the one fighting for something more than just petty revenge or greed.  He is trying to look out for everyones survival.  He understands that taking back Winterfell is a prerequisite for fighting the Night King.  Sansa is not a leader.

7933153,0,t1_d47k58k,I think everything would have been fine and still can be fine if they showed Arya having developed some skills that could actually be useful to the Starks in the near future. Up till now she just seems like regular old Arya that can fight a bit better in the dark than most people. If she actually became a wicked awesome assassin but still chose to eventually go back to being Arya that would be a totally fine justification for the Braavos plotline. Which they may still be able to do perhaps her being bad at fighting with the Waif was just a way to manufacture tension and once she gets back to Westeros well see that all that training really has paid off and she can serve her house behind the scenes picking off key targets. As of now if this is all we get I cant see her being any more use to house stark than being one more person to nag Jon. ,gameofthrones,d47reqp,1,t5_2rjz2

Most of us still liked it or at least partially liked it we are just disappointed in how much better it could have been. Its still has some aspects that are really strong like the acting costumes make upzombie mountains eyes! amazing goresparrow getting his little head thorn off! and witty dialogueLady Crane was amazing and Jamie as well or one liners I prefer chickenor  youre shit at dying  The show feels rushed or at times illogicalpointless. It skips so much like Arya getting into the Hall of Faces Blackfish dying AND yet finds so much time for Tyrion telling jokes and Podrick and Bronnwhich I sort of enjoyed.  tldr we still like it just wish it was done better,gameofthrones,d47upmb,1,t5_2rjz2

I think the Waif was still in training herself and Ive always thought that the reason Waif hated Arya from the start was that she resented Jaqen favoring the new student over her perhaps with an element of class hatred as well since they state that Aryas pretty much the only nobleborn theyve trained.  People seem to be thinking that the Waif is already some superassassin but the shows never shown us her being particularly good at anything beyond closequarters fighting and shes certainly never had great control over her emotions.

Frankly he should have just asked Jamie why the fuck he would care and let Jamie mull that over for a while.  Two I dont see why the Blackfish would just straight up throw his life away like that. He could have easily done some good helping Sansa and John even if it was just recruiting on his way back up to Winterfell. Instead he just marches back into his death against three armies. He might as well just dove onto them as they crossed the drawbridge with a knife in his teeth. At least it would have been more badass.

Significant levels of hepatitis A and enteroviruses have been detected in Venices canals in relation to the lack of proper sewage treatment and even though swimming in the canals is forbidden the seasonal flooding in Venice exposes tourists and locals to the dangers of untreated sewage.

That being said the only different course of action Tyrion could have taken would be to kill the ambassadors he meets with.

7967073,0,t1_d4avzkb,But if Lady Crane had already been murdered by the time she shows up in this scene and Arya doesnt realise until later  now that would have worked! It also would solve another issue that bothered me which is that the waif said the Lady died in pain. But it seems to me she died in a second as Arya was woken by the noise of her body hitting the floor and at that point she was already gone. No screaming nothing. Its not a painful death if its quick! But if she had been killed prior to the scene it could have been and it would have been an awful reveal alongside Aryas mortal fear at learning Lady Crane is in fact the waif.

Varys is aware that his informants have uncovered something important and he needs to get back to Kings Landing.

7993664,0,t1_d4e7j0v,Something like that probably.Some of the leadersimportant figures who dont fight are the most likely choices. And there arent too many choices there. Tormond and Davos for example are important leaders but seemed to be part of the battle.I dont think Jon was actually shown raising his sword or fighting in battle so theres a smaller chance he could be one of them in the back to. The books imply that Tywin Lannister often sits at the back of his army in battles watching the fight unfold so that he can order some men held in reserve to go where he sees theyre needed most where his army is losing the fight or most vulnerable.

The knights of the vale are most likely going to show up to save the day since that seems to be the trend of this season although I hope that it will be the Umbers that were playing Ramsay all along. ,gameofthrones,d4en0hr,1,t5_2rjz2

The facts as they stand are such The Mountain is in KL The Hound is heading North. The Mountain goes where Cersei goes and her child is in KL so she stays in KL.

7995967,0,t3_4op407,Rewatching some old thrones and heard something I thought was interesting considering the theory about Little Finger  screwing over the Starks after he helps fight off the boltons with the Knights of the vale. Varys is talking to the queen of thorns when he says He would see this country burn if he could rule the ashes in regards to Petyr. As much as I dont want the boltons to win the battle of the bastards I dont know if I could take watching the Starks get fucked over again.

8008295,1,t3_4owdk2,Am I the only one who has found this season to be mildly disappointing with this episode being the most so? Cinematically this episode was shot absolutely beautifully. No arguments there. That battle was a masterpiece with the only contender for realistic full scale battle being Saving Private Ryans DDay. But other than that everything else felt wildly predictable and flat. Only thing that wasnt entirely expected was the final scene with Ramsays dogs and even that felt like something that should have resolved outside. The one who passes judgement swings the sword and all that. I just feel that this has been one of he weaker episodes Ive seen. It was very grand. But not a clever episode in the least. ,gameofthrones,d4g7hij,3,t5_2rjz2

Weve pleaded with every house that will have us the Blackfish wont help us. Were lucky to have this many men.gt I disagree. Ramsay needed the Starks either dead or in his custody in the case of Sansa. He wasnt just defending Winterfell. Even if they had never planned on taking the castle back Ramsay would have tried to hunt them down.He wouldnt have waited indefinitely but you cant just go from battle to chasing an army at a moments notice. Planning a chase requires supplies and equipment and it takes time.

8011058,0,t1_d4ghgcf,I think until she spurred those feelings again he has moved on from Winterfell and the politics of Westerns. Before he died his only focus was the walker invasion. He had left behind the stuff that tied him to the Starks. The Starks made him the man he is but his time in Winterfell is filled with hurtful memories. His life at the Wall gave him new purpose. After he comes back he knows everything that is going on but has no intention of claiming Winterfell...He wants to basically retreat from the world. Sansa appeals to his sense of duty Honour and familial love in order to get what she wants. Yes he doesnt really have a choice but he is emotionally manipulated by Sansa all the same. An example of this is the Stark cloak she gives him. A this is who you really are scene which is what Jon always wanted to be. He is then subsequently reminded by her that he isnt full Stark and that they are fighting for control of HER Winterfell. I dont know methinks Jon is being manipulated as a result of his good qualities the same way Ned was. ,gameofthrones,d4gin1c,1,t5_2rjz2

Theyll definitely be coming from the south though amirite? LOL were super far north get it? Of course thats if they show up at all I mean which I have no idea if they will or not. It all depends on whether we can trust the guy who arranged my marriage to Ramsay. Do you think hes still thirsting hard enough for me to make the effort?

8011882,0,t3_4oyssf,First a story sets up conflict in GoT the good guys die then the conflict escalates good guys and bad guys dying but then at some point you have to get to the home stretch save a few good guys for the final battle against the WW.  They cant really afford to lose more of the good guys and its arguably to late in the gamestory to introduce new ones.  The players still around now both good and bad are the key players to the end game.I think its just the everybody dying phase has to cool off at least a bit in the final stages until we get to the final showdown.

8011997,0,t3_4owdvs,So I was at a water park in Florida when I was like  or whatever. Went in the lazy river and there was a metric shitton of people in tubes. I wanted to get around them but there wasnt an opening so I had the brilliant idea of swimming underneath them. After almost a minute of swimming there was still no end to the sea of yellow rubber and fat asses and I was running out of breath. Being freaking  I did what any child would do and promptly started freaking the fuck out. I frantically swam back and forth between the walls trying to find an opening between the tubes so I could come back up for air. In desperation I dropped manners over survival and kicked a lady square in the cheeks causing her to flop out of the tube in surprise so I could come back up for air. Not the same thing as dying under a crowd of people in battle but I definitely had the same thought of I would REALLY prefer not to die this way. ,gameofthrones,d4gmftw,3,t5_2rjz2

To be honest if anything their cavalry should have charged with Jon. Maybe leave some safe space for a clean pickup but not near as much as the distance they had to cover.Furthermore I think what makes Jons action much more reasonable is that Rickon is the heir to Winterfell.

8013459,0,t1_d4gs6ow,But you have to understand a lot of people fighting there as common soldiers are just... well bad. Like when Rob is king he has  son of Rickard Karstark in his guard and Jaimed slices them both up as nothing when he was one of the best knights alive... Its like he showed excellent swordsmanship but there is nobody to compare him to.    As I said logicly it makes no sense because he spend a lot of his time commanding and travelling rather than sword training in the books he spends much more time sword training yet he isnt even close to best fighter.   But the show has a lot of offscreen time as I said and they can do whatever they want. Jon isnt confirmed best fighter nor is it logicly sound but if they want to they can just make it so Offscreen time  flashbacks or just mentions to past gets you pretty much anything you want. Or they can just roll with him being best fighter and pretend he practiced every time he was offscreen.,gameofthrones,d4gsd0l,1,t5_2rjz2

8014572,0,t1_d4gw3u7,Ummm how about a full scale charge into an enemy force that is  or  times your size and has a defensible position.  It was pure suicide and only worked because the riders of rohan magically appeared at the last moment to save the day.  Davos explicitly states the night before how they have to goad Ramsay into attacking them so they can be on the defensive and prevent the Boltons from reaching their flanks.  GOT has done massive battle sequences superbly in the past Blackwater Hardhome and the battle at the wall and stannis afterwards were all fantastic and left this episode in the dust.  Again I still thought it was good I just think they could have gotten the same conclusion in a much better and realistic way.  ,gameofthrones,d4gwv27,2,t5_2rjz2

Theyre going to try to adapt the story so that people like it again.So Ellaria is the ruler right now essentially right? I think Varys is going to her to get Dorne on Danys side. Dany has Martell blood and the Martells have Targaryen blood due to intermarriage. Dorne was loyal to the Targaryens during Roberts rebellion albeit because the Mad King had Elia. Ellaria may see Dany as almost a second coming of Nymeria their warrior queen. I honestly might be able to accept the Sand Snakes if this is the case please dont shoot me...

8021553,0,t1_d4hazrf,I pretty much suspect that he was afraid of being locked in a keep while Jon can run around the North and gather allies. One thing Jon had was a core army of wildlings. No one in the north could predict how long wildlings could support themselves in the North it can even be supposed that they can carry on a siege independently supporting themselves by hunting. It was not shown how many provisions he had I would doubt that he could gather much from a castle twice besieged and ransacked in the last two years. Maybe it was a very real threat that his superior army will just starve inside Winterfell. Once inside a siege he could only send ravens and as his claim to the North is pretty shaky in itself it was a pretty real danger that his whole domain simply turned to support Jon andor Sansa.  ,gameofthrones,d4hp535,12,t5_2rjz2

What the fuck did they expect to happen that theyd just be past The Wall and the northern lords would be like lol okay I guess. Had they knelt to the Stannimal theyd be citizens of the Realm. But of course the Umbers would have turned coat sooner their main gripe was the Wildlings so it wouldve been Mannis original forces   Wildlings versus the Boltons original forces  Umbers.The Wildlings still dont know the land so Ser Twenty Goodmen still burns all the food. Maybe they had departed Castle Black sooner so the snows dont pile up but weirdly enough this still doesnt look good for The One True King.

I think the point with pointing out Cerseis predicaments though is that she does not hold the sole or any for that matter leverage over Tommen any longer and as such questioning whether Tommen in his new alliance with the High Sparrow that is being a puppet of a shadow cabinet theocracy will be ableinclined to going through on the initial deal Littlefinger made with Cersei. He might not be legitimized under this new ruleand at worst he might even be branded an enemy of the Crown! Or the Faith! Or whatever youre an enemy of when youre pissing in the Sparrows oats.Like how would the Sparrow react to receiving a raven from Littlefinger going Tweet at Sparrow! lol. Anyway so I made like a deal with Mama C that if I shanked the Boltons and the Starks I could have their house. Could you send the lease papers? Kthxbai.? Why should he uphold that deal? Would he even want to have Littlefinger running things in the North? Why should the new rule be bound by deals and alliances from the one it overthrew in a revolution?

8035965,0,t3_4p8iem,Stannis is the rightful king as the next brother in age to Robert. Right of succession is important in a hereditary monarchy as it keeps the kingdom from breaking down into mass war every time the king dies didnt work so well in this case due to Cercis children of incest.  As Cercis children arent from Robert then the throne goes to Stannis. Even if Stannis was Ramsay or book Euron levels of cruel or crazy the throne is still lawfully his. Also if RLJ is true Jon would still be a bastard through a line of succession that ended when Robert claimed the throne through conquest.There is a difference between being a hero in the thick of the fight and being a generalcommander. The person in command needs to put the lives of all their soldiers into consideration and make the choices that wins the fight the most effectively and with as few casualties for their side as possible. Being hot headed compassionate or emotional is dangerous when you have to ensure your thousands of soldiers are being utilized effectively and not wasted. There are times that you get into the thick of it but generally leading from the front is a stupid idea as your likely to just get yourself killed and having your general die is a good way to break your own armys morale and give their army a big boost in spirits. Being a skilled warrior who fights in the thick of it is all good and well but you dont do that when your responsible for the entire army.Ramsay in the battle did the smart thing by observing the battle and issuing orders. What he failed to do is use his forces efficiently and instead let his cruelty allow him to make stupid decisions like firing arrows into his own army and wasting cavalry trying to ride down Jon which clashes into the Stark Knights instead of letting them do what mounted Knights do best which is break through formations outflanking and running down routed men. Honestly Jon was insanely lucky to not be dead from that act. If he wanted to save Rickon he should of sent a knight up to save him instead of putting himself in grave danger. Sansa even warned him about Ramsay trying to manipulate him and to not get baited into a trap.Book Stannis and show Stannis have a lot of differences in how they act and how they got their northern army and the show runners made a lot of changes generally for the worse on how they portrayed Stannis. Also this whole thing isnt a sign of who is the real Azor Ahai as for one the prophecies are probably a red herring and two its obviously Davos P,gameofthrones,d4jbg8q,4,t5_2rjz2

He is irrelevant at this point and moreover his sense of honor is what got him killed and put the Starks in such a precarious position in the first place. Ned lost spectacularly and Sansa would do well not to emulate him when it comes to playing the game.Further feeding Ramsay to the dogs was not just about payback for Ramsays abuse of Sansa. It was payback for House Stark as well. Roose betrayed them and had a hand in murdering Catelyn Robb Robbs wife and potential heir. Ramsay also murdered Rickon. This was as much about avenging House Stark and decimating House Bolton as it was about payback for Ramsays treatment of Sansa. I for one am not so sure Ned would be that disappointed at this outcome but even if he were I think it is a fitting end to Ramsay and House Bolton.,gameofthrones,d4jgdxz,5,t5_2rjz2

8048048,0,t1_d4kfx4t,Half agreed. Im of the Varys school of thought power lies where men think it lies. And who is left to think Jon and Sansa are in power? Not the crown not the clearly exhausted banners of the north not the knights of the Vale. Sansa and Jon are in the same position as the Blackfish except they have no moat no door and a decimated army.

8049783,0,t1_d4kus5c,I understand why people have that perspective but I disagree completely. The series is literally about Walt breaking bad and the removal of Gus from the narrative paved the way for Walt to attempt to establish his empire and go full druglord mode. He fails miserably due to his arrogance and hubris and it ultimately destroys him and everyone in his life. Most people that I have spoken to or read who think it shouldve ended after season four seem to think that Walt was the good guy or some kind of antihero. He was a villain through and through and season five really explores this. Uncle Jacks lack of connection to the other seasons in no way negates the emotional impact of the narrative as it shifts from being about Walt overcoming the odds to Walt losing control of himself. The fact that Jack was just some neoNazi rentavillain was kind of the point. It shifted from the typical Walt vs.  to Hank vs. Walt which is the most compelling and emotional plotline the show explored period. Walt cant go back and undo what he did but freeing Jesse and killing Jack and his cronies gives Walt the slightest bit of redemption. But thats just like my opinion man.,gameofthrones,d4kvdam,3,t5_2rjz2

All characters are some degree of grey. Jamie is one of the greyest characters in the whole series. Are you sure youve been paying attention to Jamies story arc example Sure pushing Bran out of the window is evil when viewed uniquely from Brans POV but having the truth get out that Jeoffrey et al. are illegitimate children could not only put the Lanisters at risk but possibly destabilize the entire kingdom.

8057553,0,t3_4ph8hn,Did anyone notice Jon kissing Sansa on the forehead in the preview for the season finale? Of course its not out of the realm of possibility for a brother to kiss a sister on the forehead but I get the feeling that the show is inching towards having them be together by the end of the series. If they are cousins then no incest and Sansa has been shown to be the Stark child least close to Jon while they were growing up so its somewhat less disturbing to think of them together. Further one could easily view Sansa as sort of an Elizabeth of York type  Martin and the show seem to be setting her up as the queen of the chessboard although I dont think shed rule in her own right but rather as a queen consort like Elizabeth. I think we can rule Aegon out as a truly important character since the show seems to have culled his character entirely. So whos legitimately left for her as a noblewoman of the highest pedigree to be with? Jon is really the only guy with a potentially legit claim to the throne assuming RLJ and that Rhaegar and Lyanna were secretly married. And if he were to be first named King in the North then marrying Sansa would give him even more legitimacy for that same reason Henry VII took Elizabeth of York as a wife. Also A Song of Ice and Fire was always at its heart a tale about the Starks and the Targaryens  besides the fact that the name of the saga itself implies that it is about these two noble houses Martins original pitch to publishers named five characters as the main characters of the saga Arya Bran Jon Dany and Tyrion. I would guess that Martins storyline has since evolved to include Sansa in that group as well. Tyrion is the only major character who is potentially not of either of those houses although there is a theory that he is Aerys and Joannas child and therefore half Targaryen. It doesnt seem like Dany or Arya is going to make it all the way to the end of the series which leaves Sansa Jon and Tyrion as the survivors in his original pitch FYI Martin had Arya Jon and Tyrion in a love triangle and it would make sense if he has since substituted Sansa for Arya since Arya is shown to be much more of a sibling in the traditional sense to Jon. Once you get past the squick factor of Sansa and Jon hooking up it would be rather fitting for them to end up together and to rule as king and queen in the North or perhaps even the Seven Kingdoms  they would be like Cat and Ned .. ETA We also mustnt forget as the original poster noted that Jon has a thing for redheads. ,gameofthrones,d4lqu03,2,t5_2rjz2

Jaime will be disgusted with Walder Frey  but I was thinking he was there to witness Freys murder.   There is a theory that Arya will kill one of Freys sons and then kill Frey with the face of his son.  It is an interesting one.  But Maisie Williams is not in her face at least on the cast list this week.

She was saved by Theon from Ramseys girl and Im guessing you forgot the fact that Brienne saved her the first episode of the season. I know a lot of people like the idea of her being another type of Littlefinger  or Varys but the hard truth is she doesnt compare to them and she never will. I feel like Im taking crazy pills she has only lied for Littlefinger a few times got Jon to do all the hard work on taking back Winterfell watched some dogs eat Ramsey and wrote two letters.

I also heard a rumour about a Dorne scene so watch out for that. Just a rumour though stay tuned. I hope they do each storyline in turn like they almost did last episode. Bran gets to the wall and has a vision followed multiple northern discussions involving sad John scheming Little Finger and angry Davos. Sam and Gilly enjoy a vista of the streets of Old Town. Frey has a feast and dies along with an Arya seen which may well be in the same arc. Something involving Dorne connecting them with Dannys cause. Danny finishes her arrangements in Mereen before sailing out of the harbour.  Tommen dies somehow pushing Cersei of the deep end. Something happens regarding the White Walkers which puts the realm in imminent danger. Cut to black and tells us when the fuck the book is coming outIts gonna be sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.Dear god how did I forget about the Hound?

8076612,0,t3_4psjov,Ill play the devils advocate here.. Referring to that particular scene There are plenty of reasons why people hated that scene but I think most of it revolves around Sansa since not only is she in a different storyline in the books shes also suffered so much up to that point. While weve seen just how far her character has developed now back then people thought it was just another storyline involving her being victimized by another psychopath again for the sake of shock value. Or at least from what I gathered as to their reasoning.. Referring to media portrayal of rape in general I also think its a matter of sexual assault being a much more common problem for women to deal with in the everyday world. Rape is still a very relevant difficulty to discuss as opposed presumably less common acts of brutality such as castration. As a result if a rape is shown onoffscreen youre much more likely to have women getting uncomfortable because it can realistically happen to them. Then again violent assaults are also common but as someone mentioned earlier rape has the potential to be more psychologically destructive as well as our cultures portrayal of violence versus sex being very different.With that said I do strongly agree with Martins view that rape does portray reality and that getting rid of it in his universe would be dishonest. However its always going to be tricky dealing this subject matter so no matter what you do theres at least someone whos going to make an uproar about this.,gameofthrones,d4nvxop,8,t5_2rjz2

We havent watched that scene yet so it has to be Sundays episode. My guess is by the promo and this scene that he meets with Sansa to discuss his reward in private.,gameofthrones,d4nxtob,2,t5_2rjz2

Their marriage was a duty.In Neds memories he remembers Lyanna telling him about she was not happy to marry him because she knew he frequented brothels and that he would never be faithful to her. Ned knew Robert had at least one bastard child at this point and assured her that Robert would love her to which Lyanna replied Love is sweet dearest Ned but it cannot change a mans nature.Does that sound like a woman happy to marry Robert?She did not get the option to agree to the marriage. She was told shed be marrying him.  Highborn marriages are often arranged by the parents without the consent of those to be married and they do it out of duty.,gameofthrones,d4orq6g,2,t5_2rjz2

His agenda is probably going to be to go take Riverlands back from the Freys hand it back to the Tullys and then sit tight in the North.Dany is going to be making landfall in Dorne most likely allied with the Martells and the Tyrells  whats left of them anyway. Once she gets the lay of the land and understands whats happening in the North she will probably arrange a deal with Jon. At that point Lannisters are going to be caught between a rock and a hard place. Theyll be completely obliterated.Once Dany has Kings Landing and basically the entire South and Jon has the entire North theyll unite powers to face the Night King together.,gameofthrones,d4pbw70,25,t5_2rjz2

8089672,0,t3_4q0yeg,I think this might be my favorite episode of the entire series. Holy shit! I took quite a few notes.I was so worried when I saw Dorne in the previously on. But what can you do?The music in this episode was phenomenal! Maybe some of my favorite pieces from this season. It definitely set the tone while being played during nearly  minutes of no talking.It sounded like Loras was signing up for the Nights Watch with his confession.Pycelle isnt a big loss. But Lancel! Whoa! I wonder if Cersei had him left alive like that so he could struggle to stop the Wildfyre only to have it blow up in his face. I wouldnt put it past her. I was really not expecting so many main characters to be taken out in one big bang. That was crazy! It makes me worried though. What if the fire doesnt go out? What if it spreads and catches the other caches of Wildfyre alight?Tommen jumping out the window! I am speechless. I really was not expecting him to do that. And I dont think Cersei was either. She probably just planned on keeping him locked up in a room while she ruled over Kings Landing. I dont know how Jamie is going to take this news though. His last child is finally dead and his sister just committed an act of terrorism. Sure he says he is loyal to her. But is he really going to stand by her with all that has happened?I was very worried that Bronn and Jamie were going to get killed Red Wedding style but the Freys are too chicken shit to do that. I really really want more Edmure next season. Tobias Menzies is a fantastic actor.Sam and Gilly at the one sept which I have blanked on the name. But holy shit! It is so beautiful! So was Gilly. Wow. That library is my heaven! If a place like that actually existed I would be there every day of my life.Davos...I was so choked up. I was wondering if maybe Mel would try and bring Rickon back or maybe that she would actually be killed for her crimes. But you cant have everything and this episode gave us a lot.Varys in Dorne with the queen of thorns! Its hard to be disappointed with that scene. Does Dorne stand behind Dany now?Dario quoting Sandor there with his whole Fuck Mereen speech. You know...I kind of feel bad for him. But I hope this means that the actor is returning to Orphan Black for the final season. I am beyond happy that Tyrion is the hand of the queen. He did an amazing job the last time he was the Hand. Imagine what hell accomplish now!ARYA! AHHHHHHHHHH! SWEET REVENGE! HOLY SHIT! That was so disturbing and so satisfying. Im surprised she  didnt take out Jamie while he was there though. Hopefully she will free Edmure and they will take back Riverrun or something. I dont know where her story is going outside a journey of revenge. Maybe shell burn down Kings Landing.RLJ CONFIRMED! FUCK YES! Petyr almost had me with his proposal to Sansa. He was seething as everyone declared Jon KING IN DA NORF! Finally Dany is heading to Westeros! HOLY SHIT YES! The dragons can totally go toe to toe with the White Walkers! These last two seasons are going to be bonkers!Varys on the ship with Dany makes me believe he has gotten Dorne on her side. And also that he can teleport.,gameofthrones,d4pcq0q,10,t5_2rjz2

8090507,0,t1_d4pfz0h,In the behind the scenes they definitely imply that Sansa is going to have an issue with Jon being named King. Edit credit to uahellborn lady for this comment with quotesYeah the official recap saysJon and Sansa exchange smiles but hers fades as Jon turns away. She glances at Littlefinger.And from Sophie TurnerHes named King in the North and she kind of gets no credit for it. Jon doesnt acknowledge everything his sister has done for him after all that theyve been through. And its not that shes looking for praise or anything she did it because she wants revenge and also because she wants her home back. Jon hes so naive! So Sansas just a little bit.. agitated.and Kit HaringtonI think Jon is oblivious. I dont think hes learned his lesson from trying to pay attention to what Sansas feeling. He says he has but hes asking her to trust him not listening watching and observing her. I think that could be a real problem for him.and DampDTheres definitely a hint of conflict there. We see that come out in episode  where shes at the war council and no one asks her opinion despite the fact that she knows Ramsay better than anyone. So I think theres a little bit of anger a little bit of jealousy and that relationship will be crucial to watch.So yeah. Theyre definitely hinting at some kind of conflict next season IMO.,gameofthrones,d4pg3hd,46,t5_2rjz2

8090782,0,t1_d4pgpt8,As a piece of war spectacle cinema I know its technically not a movie I just cant think of a better phrase atm I thought it was pretty perfect. It may not have had a pull the rug out from under you moment but I didnt find it  predictable nor was I looking out for something like that while watching. Plus they did things that could be classified as not typical game of thrones storytelling actions. The good guys won they subverted the rule of three with Ramsays arrows they built up the possibility of Jon dying for a second time and didnt follow through with it etc. Plus the level of research they did as far as battle strategy and homage was brilliant. Using strategy from the Roman wars of the s BC and the battles between the French and English during the hundred years war were awesome plus callbacks  to some medieval wars and the American civil war with the piles of bodies were unexpected and haunting. I feel like the pure spectacle of this scale was completely unexpected. The detail was rich and meticulously crafted. I think back to Hardhome and even with that battle scene being as unbelievable as it was I had no idea that they would be able to so soundly top it. Part of me thinks that this show being so masterful about including misdirection and plot twiststurns is its own worst enemy when they put out episodes like this that werent made for us to think about them in the same way. It was wonderful imo.,gameofthrones,d4ph7hn,6,t5_2rjz2

While still having the blood and guts of her murdered children all over him he rapes Elia then kills her as well.

Also completely destroyed.Tyrells theoretically Loras has two brothers but weve never seen them. Olenna is going to destroy them though. Outside of that the army is mostly notspent.Targaryans Daenarys is sailing now has a massive army of Dothraqi and unsullied.Lannisters Kevan and the rest of the cousins dont like her technically run by Cersei. The army could either be run by Jaime whose going to have some choice words with Cersei or Kevan who probably just wants her dead.Tullys Big axe to grind. Probably doesnt control anything.Freys Complete turmoil. Considering the books the Freys are probably busy beating each other to death. Also only real Lannister ally.Arryns riding with Jon mostly unspent army.Greyjoys split one side sailing to conquer Westeros the other sailing to raid it I guess? Both have fairly large navies and the men to man them.Starks Theyre after the Lannisters. A couple of Northern houses so admittedly pretty spent.Boltons There may be a ThirdCousin Walder? No army though. Also a dislike of the Lannisters see the whole SansaRamsay issue.,gameofthrones,d4pkxf5,1,t5_2rjz2

8092977,0,t1_d4pjiqp,Possibly. However there are three on her list in Kings Landing. Cersei probably wont die by Arya but Jamie. Fulfilling the prophecy given to her by Maggie the Frog. Jamies isnt on her list so theres a no go. Mountain is undead and I think Arya would have a hell of a tough time killing him. Also would seem more fitting for the Hound to kill the Mountain.Yet if Arya goes North then shell probably end up killing Mel whos on her list especially since she said she saw Death in Aryas eyes perhaps her own. Also coincides with Melisandra travelling south from Winterfell and Arya travelling North from the Twins making their paths collide. I personally think the second one has a stronger narrative since it progresses to a reunion and lines up Aryas list to be finished through possible upcoming events. ,gameofthrones,d4pq24z,5,t5_2rjz2

8093618,0,t1_d4pdqoc,I agree its a fun theory to talk about but I dont think I would like it. It would feel so weird for the Night King to use a human to manipulate like that. Besides Benjen was ressurected  seasons ago. It makes sense he was told that he couldnt go south of the wall but why would they tell him oh yeah and if ever your mate Bran happens to come north of the wall and if he happens to get the mark of the night king if he passes through  the wall than the magic is broken.And while I do think the theory is viable and holds merit. Justifying it by Benjen being not his old lovable self? Come on you said it yourself. Dead and living alone north of the wall for  seasons. Yeah dont think the old merry Benjen still be there. Besides he was parting with the only family and probably sane people he met since he went north knowing that he would never meet them again.

I think Jaime is certainly a target for Arya by virtue of his family name and the desire to cause grief and suffering to Cersei.Whether that means its Arya in that scene though is not clear though I personally believe it to be the case  Otherwise it means rather than unburdening the House of Black and White of an extra face or two she killed an innocent serving girl purely to use her face.

I truly think the show hurt itself over the last few seasons by tethering itself to the books.

Im really getting if I go down Ill bring you all with me vibes from her actions.  Its interesting when they started talking about enormous caches of wildfire buried beneath the city I had always assumed that when it went off it would raze the entire city.

Margaery at one point ironically now mentions that Lord Greenhand was too eager to spread his seed and had far too many potential heirs.  The Lannisters were chastised for having so many descendants but Cersei and Jaime have seen to that end killing their uncle several of their cousins their aunt and many more. The Starks also had a larger family but Benjen joined the nights watch Branden was murdered by the mad king Neds father was murdered by the mad king Lyanna died giving birth Robb and Cat died at the red wedding and Rickon was shot. ,gameofthrones,d4pz9se,6,t5_2rjz2

8095998,0,t3_4q2crv,Heh.  That theory was written by me  yrs ago on a site call Dragonstone run by Peter Gibbs.  That was the very first site to ever discuss about most of the theories that dedicated to GoT. That site and the Internet Archive that kept it is no longer available.    This interview was done in  but I cant find it anywhere but I got it from Reddit  Spoilers everything GRRM refers to fans guessing the secret Im going to reveal in book  back in  and his decision about whether to change the story   gt HOST Do you sometimes look at the speculations on the internet and go OMG how are they coming up with these theories?  gt GRRM You know I did once upon a time long long time ago but I ve given up doing that. Actually the internet song of ice and fire community game of thrones community of course has grown hugely over the years. It actually began right here in Australia the very first website ever devoted to the series was started by a guy named Peter Gibbs it was called Dragonstone and it was based here in Australia and it was the first bulletin board where people would post their theories and discuss them  talk about who was their favorite character talk about what secrets they thought i was hiding or not hiding and when that occurred  now were going back to around  when this dragonstone started i did look at I was very flattered to have a website entirely devoted to fans discussing not fantasy in general not Science fiction in general but specifically the series that i was working on and i read some of the discussions but then it rapidly dawned on me you know i should not be doing this.     gt For one thing i dont want to actually post there because the minute i post there the free discussion among fans who are all more or less equal ends and it becomes instead everybody gather around the author and ask him questions and thats a distortion of what the format should be and i didnt want to do that. And the other thing is yeah some of the theories were incredibly wrong headed and amusing in that sense. Some of them were clever and maybe i hadnt thought of them but now im saying you know that would be a good idea audience laughter gt HOST have you done that? gt GRRM no i dont want to do that either because then im like taking ideas from the fans i want this to be my own ideas. gt and then the other one was of course I have certain things that Im laying clues for that there will be revelations later on. Some people had put together those clues even as early as  adding things together gt What do I do with that? These people have guessed the secret that Im going to reveal in book . People have already guessed that here and book  is just out. You really have  choices there you can ignore it and proceed with your plan despite the fact that some people know where youre going or you can get all panicky and say Oh my god theyve figured it out I cant let that be Ill have to change it Ill have to go in a different direction. gt And I think some writers do that and I think thats always a mistake. You know if youve planned your book that the butler did it and then you read on the internet someones figured out that the butler did it and you suddenly change in midstream and it was the chambermaid who did it then you screw up the whole book because youve got this foreshadowing early on and youve got these clues that youve planted now theyre dead ends so you have to introduce other clues and youre retconning  its a mess gt so i decided as early as Dragonstones hey day and i think thats site had gone away by  or so that I would stay off the fan sites and let those by for the fans let those be for the readers let them argue their theories whether their right whether their wrong but i dont need to know about that.,gameofthrones,d4q2a3v,1,t5_2rjz2

Arya reminded me of Tantalus in Greek mythology.  Glad to see Samwell in the Citadel at last.  Brans vision of Jons parentage finally happened.  And I love how Jon and Sansa are evolving.The only letdown for me was they didnt really show the fiery carnage.  It was mostly the green CGI stuff as seen from a distance.  It wouldve had more visual impact if theyd shown more of the chaos of people trying to get out and burning alive.  But otherwise fantastic episode.

Im stating that letting your rule of law reflect your faith as Tommen was doing in my opinion is no way to rule at all and why I consider it to be the reason Tommen made an awful King. Stannis and Tommen were force feeding their citizens religion whether they accepted it or not in which they were put on trial murdered. What your religion says shouldnt justify the way you rule in general  weve seen some pretty gruesome events as a result of this practice.

8099601,0,t1_d4q1nte,I get what youre saying and Ill like to give some personal insight since it looks like youre getting downvoted for having a different opinion. I think the looks of the actress help to cement something Lyannas beauty in the show has been hyped by characters who never really saw her alive and know only as much about her and her story as Ned considered safe to be known.  All people in westeros know is that a war was fought in her name  lead by two men who apparently lovedlusted after her so is not a giant leap of logic  to infer that the woman was incredibly beautiful and of course after Robert wins the story becomes romanticized and Lyanna along with it. Yet as we discovered with Brans vision there is a lot we and pretty much everyone in westeros dont know about the Rebellion and Lyanna. The truth behind the war is much more complicated than the story of two men destroying a kingdom enraptured with the beauty of a woman.I think its telling that her appearance got this disappointed reaction out of some viewers had she been the supermodel kind of beautiful people were expecting  they wouldnt have questioned why there was such a fuss made about her now they see she was pretty at best with nothing physically outstanding about her appareance it makes for an interesting line of questions  amongs them Roberts passionate affections and longstanding yearnings and Rhaegars reasons  beautiful and dutiful by all accounts  to choose her amongst all women in the kingdom to start a war over.,gameofthrones,d4qguy5,3,t5_2rjz2

Say that  times fastBetrayed for Gold  Jorah betrayed her by informing on her to VarysSmall Council.Betrayed for Love  Could yet to of happened. With the books and shows at different place now it is hard to say.There is also a theory that these arent betrayals against Dany but possibly her betraying others.Betraying for Blood  She betrayed the Masters when she renegged her deal and had Drogon fry the Master. She kind of essentially stole the unsullied for the purpose of War.Betrayed for Gold  I guess you could argue the way she sort of used Xaro Xhoan Doxos. I mean it was a pretty mutually crap relationship but she did use him for power and eventually threw him aside. So maybe? Betrayed for Love  Again I cant think of anything she has done yet that might relate to this so perhaps it is still a future event. The biggest things with prophecies is that they are incredibly wobbly in the wording and very opening to interpretation so dont expect her to ever actually so Oh man he just totally betrayed me for gold Would be easier though.

But theyre becoming vastly different people. Jaime was an arrogant dickhead at the start of the series he was dishonourable and unlikable. He is becoming more honourable more level headed and humble. Conversely Cersei is descending into madness. Jaime killed the Mad King for wanting to burn everyone and Cersei just burned everyone. He is going through a crazy redemption arc right now while she is becoming more and more unbalanced. To have Tyrion kill her would be boring and lazy story telling.

8103244,0,t1_d4qev7p,My guess is they dont get the chance to declare for anyone. I think Danys fleet is heading straight for the Stormlands nnd Storms End. Taking Roberts old seat would be a sweet symbolic coup for the start of her invasion. It also makes strategic sense. Taking the Stormlands would consolidate her control on the South. She can also send her fleet to take Dragonstone from there and her army can use it as a starting point for attacking the Crownlands. I think shell take Storms End and after that she will gradually win over the Storm Lords who though they rebelled against her father are fed up with Lanister rule. ,gameofthrones,d4qvlw0,4,t5_2rjz2

8104099,0,t3_4q55jt,I feel that she definitely came willingly and that comes in weighing the burden of this child against Ned Starks backbone which is his honor. Ned was betraying the very reason he was there and completely devoid himself of honor by raising the child of his Kings nemesis. I think thats why we were shown Arthur Dayne being stabbed in the back to show Ned can lie. Lyanna was dying and she was very much hallucinating and seeping away but her intent was there. She knew he was important and she was given that belief by Rhaegar. It doesnt make sense for them not to be in love. ,gameofthrones,d4qz250,8,t5_2rjz2

8107790,0,t1_d4r5t7f,No. Sansa and Tyrion never consummated their marriage. Therefore it is incomplete and invalid. Remember how Tyrion forbid the bedding ceremony? The bedding ceremony is how the culture makes sure the marriage is final  This incomplete marriage is what made her marriage to Ramsey legitimate. They were wed lawfully and ReekTheon witnessed the consummation. Sansa may say she is a Stark but she is technically Sansa Bolton and Ramseys lawful widow. ,gameofthrones,d4rdzmw,5,t5_2rjz2
8107794,0,t1_d4rc6jx,Nope. Robert and Lyanna had yet to be wed when she was kidnappedran away with Rhaegar. They didnt have any children. But yeah Roberts grandmother was a Targaryen. Its one of the reasons that Jon Arryn insisted that Robert be the figurehead of the Rebellion and that Robert be the one to take the throne. After killing Aerys Rhaegar Rhaegars children and forcing Daenerys and Viserys into exile Robert was technically next in line of succession for the throne. ,gameofthrones,d4re07y,7,t5_2rjz2

8108148,0,t1_d4rdtes,Jaehaerys relied heavily on his Hand and closest friend Septon Barth. Barth was described as plain spoken but possessing of a brilliant mind. He was commonborn his father a blacksmith. After he joined the Faith his intelligence was plain for all to see and saw his appointment to oversee the Red Keeps library a position he excelled in attending to the Kings books and records.King Jaehaerys I Targaryen who loved to read became acquainted with Barth and the pair developed a friendship. The king saw Barths worth and eventually named him his Hand of the King. Barth was sent to Oldtown to forge a lasting agreement between the Iron Throne and the Faith of the Seven. This agreement took away the right of the Faith to conduct criminal trials while at the same time Jaehaerys pledged upon the Iron Throne that the crown would always defend the Faith. The great schism between crown and faith were healed by this accord.While it was said that Queen Alysanne Targaryen was Jaehaeryss great love Barth was his greatest friend.

She chose to kill her with poison because it was efficient not because she wanted to watch her die from poisoning. OP said that poison was never her style but her style has clearly changed from that of being an efficient and calculated contract killer to that of a vengeant murderer meaning that even though poisoning may not be part of her current style it certainly was her style at some point and as such the comment of never was her style would be incorrect.,gameofthrones,d4rmigz,1,t5_2rjz2

Targ blood means dick really and dragons are sentient anyway. Nobody controls dragons you can ask the freaking mother of dragons herself about that.I dont even think were going to see some mystical way to exert influence on the dragons unless theyre gonna start dredging up magical artifacts from minor plot points in prior seasons and the wider canon of supplemental material so Im pretty sure the only way Jon is going to end up riding a dragon is by gaining its respect. Which since dragons are as said smart as some maesters say even smarter than man could take as much as almost dying again or just having some rando gossip to another in earshot of the dragon about That time Lord stark was stabbed a bunch of times and died but then came back to life.,gameofthrones,d4s8jew,4,t5_2rjz2

8117305,0,t3_4qf71b,The only thing Cerseis got going for her is wildfire. Remember that wildfire can even burn dragons. I do think Littlefinger will do some trolling to cause discord I dont know how but he will. If his plan is to be on the Iron Throne hell have to come up with some way to split up the alliances.Also the biggest enemy Dany could have is herself. If she goes mad with power things can go downhill for her easily. She even hinted at this in how she felt nothing in cutting it off with Daario.Edit Also I forgot to mention that Varys may be a double agent with his own agenda. He may have made some sort of side deal with Dorne and Highgarden that Dany doesnt know about. Remember that Dorne is the only kingdom to have resisted Aegons conquest. This means they have some secret way to combat dragons. Theres the theory that Varys keeps his head bald to hide his silver hair. He may be a blackfyre a bastard line of the Targaryens. Remember that the sorcerer who cut him must have chose Varys for a reason. As Melissandre said there is power in kings blood. Also his disloyalty is hinted at by the High Priestess Kinvara when she said We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend you have nothing to fear from me. edit Theres also Euron Greyjoy. In the books he has this dragon horn that can bindcontrol dragons. The show hasnt shown it but its still possible that its an ace up his sleeve. ,gameofthrones,d4sgi13,2,t5_2rjz2

8118622,0,t1_d4slneu,Ive thought the same but it just seems weird to me that the Hound would kill Brienne. The whole reason that Brienne is killed by LSH is that LSH thinks Brienne has teamed up with Jaime and abandoned her oath. What has she done to the Hound that would give him reason to hang her? Sure she beat him on the battlefield but it doesnt seem likely that the BWB will allow him to kill her for that.

She friendzoned him hard in the godswood and pretty clearly is creeped out by him. She loves Jon straightup tells him he should be lord of Winterfell and that she considers him a Stark. Shes smiling and happy during the meeting with the Northern lords she only looks concerned when she sees Littlefingers obvious jealousy.Basically the only reasons people are thinking thered by some rift between the two character are some actor interviews bs and some lines LF said specifically to try to place a wedge between these characters which Sansa repeatedly ignoredshot down.,gameofthrones,d4tlujc,10,t5_2rjz2

Basics of it though is the prince that was promised is also Azor Ahai the savior given by Rhollor the red god Melisandre worships.The prince has a song the song of ice and fire. It gives the prophecy not sure if there is a readable version though. What we do know isPrince could actually be a princess as Valyrian is gender neutral.Born under a bleeding star meteorBorn of salt and smokeAzor Ahai fights with a flaming sword.Might be more to it but remember prophecies are always riddles or hard to interpret. For example a flaming sword could very well be a sword of fire or just a blade made from fire say the sword Dawn which is made from meteorite. Its name can be a perfect play on of course the suns light which fits perfect with the red gods image of fire and of course should Jon wield it hed be named Sword of the Morning.

8130683,0,t3_4qjw9g,I completely agree that Samwell will use magic of some kind. It was long said that to gain your Valyrian Steel chain you were to spend a day and a night beside a glass candle trying to make it glow Because in Old Valyria they used magic and enchanted glass candles to light their cities. You are then supposed to at Morning accept that magic is not real and that the higher mysteries are simply phenomenon that are not yet understood or can never be understood. Qyburn was removed from the Citadel because he refused this task. He believed that with enough time and dedication ANYTHING can be learned. He saw the living and asked himself How? and saw the dead and asked himself What if?We know that magical beings like Dragons can emanate enormous amounts of magic. It was the power of dragons that created White Walkers after all. It is said that when the dragons awoke some of the Glass Candles around Essos and Westeros lit prompting House of the Undying to search for her dragons now that they had their powers back. I fully believe Sam will be able to use magic. Maybe not in the same way as Mel The Faceless Men or the White Walkers but some kind of magic. There have been far too many hints towards him always wanting to learn it. My personal guess is that Citadelian Magic will be much more formal and scriptbased like that of worlds like Harry Potter. ,gameofthrones,d4tymxp,16,t5_2rjz2

Rember the conversation between Varys and Illyrio in season . Their plans needed the lannisters and the starks at each others throats.  if drogo had invaded in season one immediately after marrying Dany like Viserys wanted they would gave been screwed because it would have united more than half of westeros against them the forces that sided with robert and ned with have rejoined together and probably put aside plotting against each other due to to a foreign threat and the reach probably would have sided with Robert this time over viserys and drogo.So you would have had Drogos khalassar of   plus  the dornish and whatever sellsword companies Illyrio would have been able to pay for because they do not have the financial power danyngets because no conquest of slavers bay. And no unsullied.Vs.A united North West Riverlands and stormlands with the reach likely to side with them as well.Roberts army in this case is stronger and with a better mix of capabilites. He would he would have huge force of heavy calvarylannister reachstormlords plus non knight northern calvary. The northern heavy infantry armed with tall shields and pikea. The infantry forces of the other three regions are no slouches either.If the dothraki charge the infantry they hold the line and use their pikes like a hedgehogsee the first big battle in braveheart. and then hit the dothraki flanks with heavy calvary. If they dothraki decide to a ranged attack with the horse archers the westerosi just do what they unsullied and the ancient romans do absorb the arrows with their shields in a testudo formatation and use the superior range of their longbows to take out the dothraki who would be very vulnerable as they do nor wear any type of armor..Danys current forces on the otherhand are a even better mix of troops then what robert would have had under the hypthetical season  invasion.,gameofthrones,d4u15b8,-1,t5_2rjz2

8139068,1,t1_d4uwzda,gtYou people are crazy to sympathize with a terrorist like Cersei.She lived in Kings landing for a very significant portion of her life. The political landscape there comprises of murder deceit lies and even massmurder. You cant blame Cersei for flipping the table in a game she was losing. What should she have done? Attended the trial and be humiliated and carved or even worse? She was in trouble with no way out. Yet she emerged victorious with the help of extrapolation. That being said the people she killed werent innocent in her eyes. The high sparrow and his colleagues were power hungry. So was Margaery and her entourage. To her the other residents actively participated in her walk of atonement. Its not about whos right or wrong. Everybodys right in their own eyes.

On second viewing Sansa had a big ol smile on her face during Lyannas speech like she thought Lyanna was declaring for her and his name is Stark and lost it when Lyanna launches into the I dont care if hes a bastard bit.  Sansa smiles again but less than before when Jon looks at her which I interpreted as she thought Jon was going to give her props like he did earlier in private.  Smile fades completely as she looks at Littlefinger AND realizes that Jons going to say nothing.  Sansa is easily manipulated by Littlefinger still.

The styles are totally different. If you came clean and said you used the original photo as a template I dont think anyone would be upset. but passing this off as a painting you did is kinda shady.Their are many paintings on your deviant art that show this perfectly.Traced Your real styleThe edges and color of your paintings of people are very different than your original work. The anatomy seems different between the two. Maybe someone without a trained eye cant see the difference but I can.I aint trying to shit on you. Just letting you know that many artists can see through this. Simply posting a progress picture from a layer in photoshop shows us nothing. Many artists show the entire pic and program tools. Like this.Here is a good one where a person actually uses reference in the speed paint.Tracing is fine if you are trying to learn technique.

8163224,0,t3_4r2nt6,Interesting but usually the simplest answer is the correct one and your theory seems pretty unnecessarily complex.  I just rewatched the scene and here is my take on your questionsgt Why is there any fighting at all? Ned is Lyannas sister and can be trusted with her and her baby.Ned is Roberts best friend and ally.  Im not sure if Dayne knows that Rhaegar has already been killed at the Trident at this point but if he does then he is carrying out his Princes last command.  Or maybe he just wants revenge.  Or maybe he doesnt know if Ned will let the baby which is possibly the product of rape in Neds mind live.  Maybe Lyanna is dead before Ned gets up to the room and cant make him promise.  There are TONS of reasons why they would fight.gt Before fighting Arthur Dayne tells Ned Good luck in the wars to come a strange thing to say to someone you are about to fight to the death with.This really isnt strange at all.  It is probably just a salute to a worthy opponent such as the one Gladiators gave before fighting.  There are literally hundreds of cases of opponents wishing each other well should the other one survive throughout history and literature.  Doesnt seem strange in that context at all.gt When only Dayne and Ned are left Dayne could easily kill Ned at any time as the Three Eyed Raven said he wasnt just better than Ned but far better  why delay?This is your weakest point by far.  Neds not as good as Dayne but hes not a pushover by any means.  They fight as youd expect and there are only about  seconds in between Ned being disarmed and Howland stabbing Dayne from behind.  Dayne has already raised his sword for a death blow in those  seconds and is about to deliver but Howland stabs him through the neck.Your ideas are interesting and made for some nice conversations but they dont really fit the circumstances well.  Save your tinfoil for other theories.,gameofthrones,d4xy935,17,t5_2rjz2

What was the goal so that her son Joffrey can become king or because she just did not like Robert? She did say I killed Robert the king because it felt good to be rid of him. so I suppose that answers that to some extent although it seems like such a shit reason to kill off her husband and try to make the whole boar incident look like an accident.

I personally find Jon Snow interesting for the same reason I find Batman interesting. Theyre both morally rigid characters but its how their values clash with other characters that makes them interesting. Unlike Batman however Jon Snow has shown a willingness to compromise his values to a point. Hell execute Mance out of mercy. Hell execute Olly out of justice.

Braavos is saturated in fire magic Westeros in Ice magic. Magic will never die but Jon may be the great balance of the two rather than Dany.

8185764,0,t1_d50n3ab,gtmy wife and I have always thought that Tywin rejection of Cersei gave her some sort of inferiority complex and that motivates her to treat other people like shit... is that related somehow to narcissism?Most definitely.  According to object relations theorists narcissism develops as a result of the childs failure to internalize the belief that the self can contain flaws without being worthless.  This internalization can either be aided or hindered by the parents and surely Tywin didnt help when he rejected Cersei and embraced Jamie.  Her narcissistic personality organization is almost amplified by the presence of a twin since it reinforces her idea that people are either perfect or worthless.  From a young age she saw Jamie as perfect because thats how her parents perceived him and so she could only imagine that she was worthless.  By merging quite literally at times she can convince herself that she too is perfect.In regard to treating others poorly narcissism comes with a lot of anger.  That combined with the lack of empathy and a need to assert oneself as a perfect person among a sea of worthless people can sometimes result in cruel behavior.  So yes you and your wife were definitely onto something there!,gameofthrones,d50rry4,47,t5_2rjz2

8190611,0,t3_4r3y3o,I dont know if anyones mentioned this but I think the big flaw in this theory is the Trial by Combat.  Even if we assume that Varys knew about Tyrions quiet negotiations with Prince Oberyn regarding the Trial by Combat an Oberyn acting as Tyrions champion which I think is a stretch even for Varys we still know that theres NO way that Varys could have rigged the outcome of that fight.  He had know way of guaranteeing that the mountain would kill Oberyn.  If Varys plan was for Tryion to be judged guilty so that he would have a reason to travel to Dany the whole plan would have been for nothing if Oberyns showboating hadnt decided the fight.  That seems like too big of a gamble for Varys he strikes me as a man who DOESNT gamble but rather only bets on a sure thing preferably one he has arranged.  ,gameofthrones,d51dm35,1,t5_2rjz2

8191439,0,t1_d51h4g4,Yes and no. Show watchers basically have an alternate timeline and canon. There are things that are obviously not going to happen in the books because its so utterly different. For example... Book Spoilsb Sansa never goes to Winterfell and marries Ramsay. She is under a false identity in the Vale and is likely going to marry a noble there.The main things you can ruin are Jon Snows liveliness and RL  JS. Honestly though I dont think there is a single person there who doesnt think both those things are gonna happen. In the books RL  JS is so fucking obviously spelled out its ridiculous. Literally watching people trying to argue against it was always hilarious.Other than that there isnt much you can spoil. Because its not likely itll happen that way in the books or it might not happen at all. We really dont know.Basically all the characters at the end of ADWDbeginning of TWOW are in such drastically different places than the show that they cant be the same anymore. Not to mention all the characters who affect the plot who arent actually there in the show.FYI Lord Manderly not being a bigger badass in the show is such a crime. The North Remembers...Also Ian McShanes character not giving the broken man speech is a huge crime as well. One of the biggest missed opportunities of the show. I beseech you to google the broken man speech.,gameofthrones,d51hc9d,8,t5_2rjz2

8207191,0,t1_d536og7,I agree that my point is making a lot of assumptions. Dany would have to have her shit together which I know isnt necessarily likely. However lets assume for arguments sake that she does and she gets the dragons up north quickly.I think that the wall isnt necessarily something you have to protect at all costs. Its a first line of defense. It will give Northerners enough time to evacuate to a very defensible position e.g. Moat Cailin or The Twins and it will also serve as a way to severely cripple the army of the dead. Their vast numbers are their major advantage as well as their ability to create more soldiers from their fallen enemies. Give them limited soldiers to kill and deal a major blow to them at the Wall. Before the Wall comes down clear out the North get every man available down to the Neck somewhere. Force them to come at you with their entire force. Rain dragon fire down on them as they cross a chokepoint one that youve had plenty of time to fortify since you know theyre coming well in advance. Of course as I said earlier this only works if you get the Northerners to leave their ancestral homes which doesnt seem likely to happen.,gameofthrones,d53gc25,3,t5_2rjz2

8223192,0,t3_4rzwzc,Because of plots...Jon needs to be the King because next season he needs to be in a position of power. He needs to unite people to fight the WW and for that he needs power. They are foreshadowing an alliance through marriage between him and Dany be a Northern bastard with no power would be of no use and samesex marriage doesnt exist in Westeros so Jon needs to be the King and Sansa cannot be the Queen. And they are also creating a dispute between him and Sansa. And thats why they dont question why Jon left the wall and they forget that he has no right to be a King because hes a bastard and they forgot that the only person who has the Stark name in the room is Sansa so the no king but the King in the North whose name is stark speech makes no sense. In order to make the storyline move forward they need to sacrifice a bit of logic.To be fair probably going to happen in the book too only differently. Jon is going to be legitimized by Robbs decree Robb wrote a letter legitimizing Jon in the third book ? I dont remember Sansa is not in Winterfell and supposedly dead and Arya Bran and Rickon are supposedly dead as well. So it makes sense Jon to be the king.Relax a little you dont need to hate the character. The screenwriters are the ones who made this in an inconsistent way.,gameofthrones,d55ge8p,1,t5_2rjz2

Margaery would have done anything to save her brother so as long as Loras remained under the control of the faith either as a prisoner or as a member as he would have been after his trial Margaery was under Cerseis thumb.

As far as they know hes either a Lord Commander whos abandoned the wall or a resurrected splash of cold water on their religion and worldview. What hes got are a few fierce friends and beautiful hair and the former are family wildlings a little girl the former hand of a disgraced outlaw King and a few nights watchmen.

8247020,0,t3_4sbckg,Some characters like Littlefinger seem to be able to show up whenever convient regardless of where they just were.Overall though its TV. Nobody wants to watch Littlefinger walk for  days to whatever town hes supposed to be in. The show skips the walking scenes as much as  they can to cut down on unnecessary fluff. ,gameofthrones,d58fln8,1,t5_2rjz2
8247040,0,t3_4sbckg,I think part of this is that this story is really of its own kind.  I mean the scope of the show is so massive to incorporate so many characters into POV roles.  In a story that doesnt reach as far as Game of Thrones does you see a lot more of a smaller group of people possibly even one person rather than spreading out the expose across a cast of characters who seem to be as humanly developed as if the entire story had focused on just each of them individually.  Georgiebear has done some phenomenal work its really amazing.On a story that focuses on singleperson narrative you do sorta see almost everything that goes on with said character because theres no where else to go.  Someone gave a good example below uMrDoubtfire.gtDo you really want to see Varys travel itinerary? See who he gets stuck sitting next to on his boat ride? A shot of him frowning as he goes through customs?First of all I would love to see Varys go through customs.  But my real point is that in a story with a lesser scope you probably would see the character go through customs and he probably would frown.  Theres simply not enough TV time to actually deal with all that crap so youre basically only seeing the situations in which the stakes are highest in a much larger story.  Of course the book is able to do ten times the amount the show is but even then im not a book reader Im sure the book expects you to fill in a few holes as well.  Just my point of view on the matter.  I didnt think the time skip was a big deal.  Its a much bigger deal to show Daenarys getting on her fucking ships with the fucking Dothraki to sail across the motherfucking sea.  Realistically everyone should have said ITS ABOUT MOTHERFUCKING TIME!!!  Because shes been trying to do that forever.  ,gameofthrones,d58fovu,3,t5_2rjz2

When Varys left KL he did not make any move toward visiting the Citadel or any maesters..

Baelish wants to create chaos so he can use it towards his advantage and this only further heated the tensions between the Starks and the Lannisters.

8290761,0,t1_d5dvluc,True Cersei and Robert are definitely partly to blame. I guess we dont get much backstory of how he was like when he was younger which is why its easier for the audience to be detached from his character. Hed been portrayed as obnoxious and sadistic from the very beginning and did become quite dangerous as king.With Tommen though I was quite surprised by how many people disliked him and how they labelled him a pussy even after the suicide.

8295012,0,t3_4t2vej,Theres a lot of unknown variables about that that time that we may never learn anything about. Lyanna was a teenager at that time. And if she wasnt in love I do think at the very least she was infatuated with Rhaegar. You combine that with the knowledge that she had no desire to marry Robert what so ever I can see her making an impulsive decision like that. LoveLust makes people behave irrationally. From what we know of Rhaegars character he doesnt seem like the type to hold her hostage. So there was something going on that made her stay. We also cant rule out fear. Like the OP said she was the catalyst for not only the deaths of her father and brother but thousands. Given how young she was its natural to feel overwhelmed and afraid of facing the consequences of your actions especially on that scale. And if she was already carrying Jon then she could have stayed hidden for his protection as well. ,gameofthrones,d5efohf,2,t5_2rjz2

She even said and I quote we had our wedding night many years ago.

8313931,0,t1_d5gretj,Exactly. Me being halfasleep at the time made for an interesting read.gtThis is always something that seriously bothers me as a theory. It seems like half the people I talk to who watch the show think Jon and Dany will somehow team up and become BFFs or get married. To me this just sounds completely absurd when you actually look at the characters themselves and the themes of the show.This was normal. Game Grumps dont usually have a Theme per se but Ive never heard of JonTron and Danny teaming up to make a show or anyone talking about it but OkaygtJust looking at the two they have completely different views on the world that are mutually exclusive.I mean yea sure. Danny is an exstoner and I dont think Jon has touched drugs at all.gtSure they are both fighters Dany strictly in the warlord sense Jon is actually a boots on the ground fighter as well as a militaristic leader but they are fighting for two completely different reasons.I thought this was a reference to Dannys popularity with Ninja Sex Party and now with Game Grumps and Jons switch over to Normal Boots boots on the ground fighter,gameofthrones,d5gsqde,5,t5_2rjz2

8318252,0,t1_d5hbntt,gt but I cant quite quash this tiny little hope that Gendry the smith returns and fixes Aryas shattered lonely hearWell if you look it at the perspective that the sword Ice embodies the narrative of the Stark family if Gendry reforges it itll represent the Starks coming together again and gaining justice. Because Sansa is back with Jon Arya will be returning back to Winterfel and Bran... I forgot where Bran was last time but hes pretty much everywhere now.Click here I mean just look at the scene where Tywin melts down Ice note Ilyn Payne showing the blood on Ice to Sansa is only in the books.  Grey Winds pelt Robbs direwolf this is after the Red Wedding is laying ontop of Ice. Tywin takes the head pommel and crossguard off of Ice when he then melts the swords down into Widows Wail and Oathkeeper. He then throws Grey Winds pelt into the fire.  I think once Tyrion fulfills his role and kills Cersei I suspect that hell send Arya to kill Cersei as Jaime or the such I made a whole post about it and when they settle in the Iron Throne to prepare for Winter Gendry will reforge the sword symbolizing again the justice Ed wanted at the very beginning of the show for Cersei.gtArya is the one I most want to have some love and warmth and peace. The show aged her up but in the books shes still just a child.

I mean yeah hes the most eligible bachelor in the seven kingdoms at the moment but theres no need for a marriage to seal that alliance when he really really will want those dragons.  Since the last episode I have been leaning more towards a JonXSansa marriage for which I blame you pervs.  The marriage I think makes the most sense though is Sansa and Tyrion renewing their marriage.  Not only does it unite the North with Kings Landing it also serves as a symbolic gesture of peace.  After all it was their two houses that started the whole thing in the first place.Of course I think Dany herself is a red herring.  We keep seeing comparisons with her fire and Jon Ice but now we know that Jon is already Fire and Ice so Dany would be extra fire.  And since both Martin and DampD have said that the story isnt going to end with a war all Lord of the Rings style I expect it will be about Jon preventing a war between Fire dragons and Ice White Walkers bringing balance back to the world and marking the end of magic.,gameofthrones,d5jfsr4,2,t5_2rjz2

8414338,0,t1_d5t9s2u,The actress that hired LC could ask for Danys life as well. The price would be far less in comparison to someone like King Robert who also wanted a FM to kill Dany. Its not about the amount of money. Its about the sacrifice. A name can be offered but it doesnt mean it will be accepted. Thats what makes Arya so interesting. She plays with the names picks and chooses who lives and dies all while acting like the MFG himself. Right t the beginning she dares name Jaqen and tricks him into taking more lives then he set out too. And the weird part is that the KM lets her get away with it all. Forgives her mistakes and continues to mould and strengthen her. For what I wonder? Even her blindness wasnt a punishment but the next level in her training. Now we see Arya about to flower in Winds she is being offered to learn from Braavosi courtesans like the Merling Queen who hides behind a veil and whose face is never seen  surrounding herself with newly flowered maidens. Like Arya perhaps? What would she learn in this area of her training?  The FM dont benefit from the money they earn since they live basic bland and unlavish lives. So where does all the money go? How convenient that the most powerful bank in all the world just happens to be in the KMs backyard. Its interesting how Jon when contemplating dealing with the Iron Bank wonders how princes and Lords keep dying suddenly and replaced. And that Jaqens parting gift to Arya and her key to Braavos was an Iron Coin. There is a lot of evidence in the books that show the FM are more than just Murder Inc. You clocked a few very important details about Jaqen and Syrio. But what about their very origins? A Moonsinger who are girls lead the surviving FM to Braavos. They seem to be connected. gtAt the top she found a set of carved wooden doors twelve feet high. The lefthand door was made of weirwood pale as bone the right of gleaming ebony. In their center was a carved moon face ebony on the weirwood side weirwood on the ebony. The House of the Undying is also occupied by magical beings who play with the illusion of life amp death. The front of the Building also has a door that is half weirwood. So a certain someone can peep in? I mean why? Warlocks that live off the blue leaves of trees that grow outside their dwelling. It gives them unnatural long lives. Kinda like someone else we know? Bloodraven sustains his unnatural long life by the roots in the tree that have taken over his body. The KMs real face is nothing but a skull small pieces of skin and a graveworm he uses in one eye. He is very very old.  There are many people who agree that the idea of their being actual Gods is just a facade or illusion. That Bloodraven a decedent of CoTF and before him the CoTF have played Man and have had them worshipping and sacrificing to them. That Bran will one day wield that power controlling the past present and future. A theory that the thing that answered the prayers of the First FM was actually a CoTF giving them the magic to free themselves and cause the Doom. This blood magic. Recall this kill Jaqen made for Arya back in Harrenhal. Look at the manner of his fighting and what he does afterJaqen danced away from his slash drew his own sword drove the man back into a corner with a flurry of blows and killed him with a thrust to the heart. The Lorathi brought the blade to Arya still red with hearts blood and wiped it clean on the front of her shift. A girl should be bloody too. This is her work.

Now thay she believes Jon is tpwp I think she will tey and get him support in the Riverlands perhaps by approaching a group sympathetic to her beliefs already like the bwb.

Ive seen some fighting and battles and the BoB was great but it isnt like movie great you need build up story characters. i dont want to watch Robert mow through battle after battle I want to watch what goes on in kings landing during the war and end with an amazing battle at the end during the Trident.

8459795,0,t3_4veqzz,Why do so many people think Sansa will die? The series has been foreshadowing that she will survive and shes proven herself to be a survivor given all of the bad situations in which she has found herself. I dont think the show runners would have Tyrion utter a line like Lady Stark you may survive us yet if they werent foreshadowing that she would outlive most if not all the major characters. Seems to me that GRRM is setting her up to be the Elizabeth of York type character in this story which means she survives and also ends up as Queen Consort whether of the Seven Kingdoms or the North.My five Cersei Jaime Euron Littlefinger and a tie between YaraThe Mountain. Time to cull the herd further and set up the last season for dealing with the true main characters of the story Jon Arya Bran Sansa Tyrion Danaerys and the battle against the white walkers.,gameofthrones,d5z0cml,2,t5_2rjz2

The first season introduces an entire world and its people and sets up so much it can be overwhelming but it most certainly calms down a bit after that and youll know most of it by then. I would try the second season and see if it feels better or consider watching any of the companion videos people post online as well.

In the books his name isnt Willis for a start and Im quite sure he wasnt around the same age as Ned. Since young Ned in the show was in the courtyard at the time that Hodor went full Hodor or at least he left just before surely he would have known the story of how Willis became Hodor and told his family about it since he was there at the time and everything? ,gameofthrones,d61o4np,1,t5_2rjz2

Syrio Forel because he like Osha gave his life for Arya when he owed her family nothing. He was compensated for training her so had no cause to protect her from Merryn Trant.

8486237,0,t3_4vxoxv,I dont buy into the idea that Jon and Dany get married. Dany will take the iron throne Jon will rule as warden of the north and lord of Winterfell. Theyll be cool with this because they share Targ blood and Jon is a bastarddoesnt enjoy politics so he wont want to rule the Seven Kingdoms but he will pledge fealty to Dany and rule the north for her. He can do this because he has Stark blood has taken back Winterfell by conquest and is respected by the Wildlings and Northern houses alike.

8493322,0,t1_d636kqp,Craster giving the White Walkers his sons as the reason for them coming out of hiding is alluded to a little more in the books than it is on the show although they do have the one scene where a WW picks up a son Craster left in the woods which he then takes back to wherever they come from and turns him. Maybe they can reproduce on their own somehow but Im guessing the supply of children given to them by Craster was a huge help. Basically it seems like the WW can only be made from infant children whereas other people who die can only turn into wights. There being different types of undead was something I didnt actually recognize until I read the books. Im not sure its really explained in the show but maybe I missed it. Anyway I thought they were all considered White Walkers but the White Walkers are actually different from the wights. ,gameofthrones,d637qhs,11,t5_2rjz2

I remember The Tudors getting bogged down with all the historical happenings with war politics and international relations. Ive read several historical fictionalizations that include it all and that was good but its easier to follow on page than screen. Ive been hesitant to read the books for years but I think my craving for the deeper dive and more information and the different routes in the book is enough at this point that I would enjoy the books.

8541322,0,t3_4wqxn8,. Its very likely that Brienne will meet some people around Riverlands area and wont go back to Winterfell immediately because the show left Brienne and Podrick there. If they would just go back to Winterfell they would have gone in the finale but they were absent in the last two episodes. And they dont have their horses anymore they are moving very slowly and its even harder now because winter arrived. They could meet Arya Sandor and the Brotherhood Melisandre or Gendry in the area. Arya probably wont go back to Winterfell immediately either. She still has unfinished business with Cersei and the Mountain she is not done with her list. And she should meet some of those people in Riverlands too they are all related to her storyline.. Brienne and Jaime are slowburning starcrossed lovers of GRRM. It is an adaptation of the classic Beauty and the Beast tale as GRRM said years ago. At the moment they are in love with each other deep down but still cant admit it neither to themselves nor each other. I dont buy the theory that Brienne will kill Jaime. She may be forced to do it but she wouldnt because she loves him and she doesnt think he deserves to die she knows that he is not a man without honor and he changed after he met her and lost his hand. She would rather die for him. It is very likely that eventually one of them will be in a heavily woundednear death situation and this will make them realize the true nature of their feelings because thats what happens in beauty and the beast tale and circumstances are appropriate for this in GRRMs story as well. But they wouldnt kill each other it doesnt fit to their story. . In the books Brienne didnt agree to kill Jaime. She rejected it saying that he kept his promise and he is not the man he was before and they hanged Brienne and Podrick. In the last minute she saw innocent Podrick dying in pain and screamed sword to save him. And after that we read in the last book that she went to Riverrun and asked Jaime to come with her because otherwise the Hound will kill the girl and they left together. This is what we know so far in the books. She may be planning something to save both Jaime and Podrick or maybe something else happened to her before she arrives in Riverrun we dont know. But I can say that its extremely unlikely that Jaime will die in the end of that LSH plot. Because he has a lot of unfinished business in the story he will obviously go back to Kings Landing and maybe kill his sister in the end if nothing else. It may be possible that realization of feelings moment may come during Brienne and Jaimes LSH plot. So since there is no LSH in the show I see two possibilites here First they skipped LSH plot in the show and Jaime and Briennes encounter in Riverrun counts as that romantic reunion maybe they just started realizing their feelings there and Jaime went back to KL. Second like you said LSHs role may be given to Arya and she may either try to kill Jaime herself or force Brienne to do it. But again I think neither Arya nor Brienne will kill Jaime in the show he is probably the valonqar who will kill Cersei and I think that wont happen before season  finale at least. . Brienne didnt cause the Blackfishs death. Jaime didnt kill him either he didnt even attack the castle. The blackfish was foolish and if he is dead its his fault. But its not certain that he is dead I think. That soldier who informed Jaime that he died fighting may be a Tully soldier who was disguised in Lannister armor. The Tully soldiers werent happy when Edmure surrendered. Maybe they just killed some Lannister soldiers and escaped with the Blackfish. Just an idea.. Jaime and Briennes romantic story will definitely develop some more in one way or another because writers dont just end love stories which they slowly develop throughout booksseasons in a meaningless way without any closure or without being explored. And their individual storylines are also far from being complete. Jaimes redemption arc stills needs a lot of development he needs closures with Cersei Tyrion Daenerys Arya Sansa Jon and Bran as well as Brienne. And Briennes story is linked both to Jaime and Sansa in the show. There will be a SansaLittlefinger plot next season so where Brienne will end up may depend on that plot as well.. In the books before she was captured by LSH Briennes face was eaten by Biter. Currently half of her cheek is gone there is a hole in her face in the books. When they met in Riverrun Jaime asked her about the bandage on her face. I think GRRM did this to turn Brienne completely into the beast she was already being described as freakishly ugly in the books despite she is not ugly in the show and now she is even worse. It feels like GRRM intends to turn Jaime and Brienne into something as poetic as beauty and the beast making Jaime love her in the end although she looks like a freak. Actually in the books Jaime is a better man than in the show he has been disillusioned about Cersei long time ago and Brienne is madly in love with him although in the show its more subtle. In fact so subtle that some show fans dont even understand there is a love story. The show doesnt give the credit the books give to Jaime for some reason for example the almostrape scene with Cersei was not only consentual in the books but also she was the one who asked for it. And the same thing is true when it comes to his feelings for Brienne because the show so far made it look like Brienne is not that ugly and in fact other men are attracted to her too like Tormund Bronn etc. This decreases the perceived value of the depth of Jaimes character and the depth of his feelings for Brienne in the show. So I wonder if the show will go there as well I wonder if they will give a nasty scar to Brienne. I doubt it because they didnt even give Tyrion his nasty scars in the show but personally I think GRRMs more poetic version in the books is better. ,gameofthrones,d698fn4,6,t5_2rjz2

He quickly started to show signs of being a nice guy trapped in the role of a monster when he would try and give Sansa counsel to help her survive Joffrey. As you said as well he carved up a bunch of jackasses to save Sansa from rape. That and the fuck the king moment and  I started to come around to be a bit of a fan of his.  He has since protected Arya even though the ransom idea was long dead and basically fought to the death to be the one protecting her because he did not believe Brienne could do the job.  Now he is avenging the death of what I can only think is the closest thing to a friend he has ever had.  Dude has been a hero wrapped in a villain suit for the whole series but now he is in full on hero mode and I love it. ,gameofthrones,d6ae3fe,1,t5_2rjz2

Look at Gladiator or any other movieseries set in Rome the ritch ruling Romans are almost always seen as the bad guys or at least theres something really wrong with the system.

8586954,0,t3_4x451x,I think there are some broader strokes that are missed whenever this topic comes up. Yes the death of Rickon and Shaggy Dog is symbolically indicating that the Shaggy Dog story is over but Rickon isnt the Shaggy Dog story all the events that have happened up until now have been the Shaggy Dog story.The quotegt gt a long rambling story or joke typically one that is amusing only because it is absurdly inconsequential or pointless.Many of the things good and bad that have happened to our characters have been a matter of being in the right place at the right time a little bit of luck or a little bit of bad luck. Things could have gone dramatically different for many characters and we could have an entirely different cast of characters at this point.But you know what? None of that fucking matters. Its all been one long winded Shaggy Dogg story.Here are the absolutes that in my opinion will remain constant variables until the end of this series.This is the Song story of Ice Jon and Fire Dany.All the events that have happened up until the Hold the Door incident should be considered the Summer Period. FYIBrans direwolf being killed is another bit of symbolism. Summer is dead meaning Winter is officially here.Hopefully Ive provided enough to boldly claim that Summer Period  Shaggy Dog Story.Weve been told on several occasion that the Summer period breeds weak people because they lack the fortitude to survive when real shit is going down. The Lannisters gold will do them no good when the wights and wight walkers freeze them to death. The Tyrells lavish lifestyle will come crashing down when the wights and wight walkers freeze them to death. The Greyjoy ships will do no good when the wights and wight walkers freeze the water and march onto the iron island.The squabbling for the throne has been the Shaggy Dog story and now that winter is here only those that were preparing for it will stand a chance.No one will be remembered for what they did in the summer period the great stories will come from the heroic deeds performed by those during the long cold terrible winter well see in season  amp .,gameofthrones,d6eyh6e,2,t5_2rjz2

Robert killed the rightful heir to the throne on the Trident. And the Mountain killed Rheagars children and drove Rheagars siblings from Kings Landing.You can argue that killing Aerys was the right move because he was bad for the realm as a whole all that burning people shit but then the argument of who is the rightful king gets a little wishywashy because it hinges on your own judgement who decides if the current King is fit to rule?,gameofthrones,d6ho3cw,111,t5_2rjz2

8748979,0,t3_4zw8ht,I enjoyed your way of seeing things and theoriespredictions are very good to argue so here we go I dont think Daenerys will marry Euron like... ever even in the worst scenario. I believe that Eurons dragon horn will appear on the show I mean Daenerys is coming with a fucking large army and dragons something gotta happen so it wouldnt look so easy.I believe Cersei will blow up kings landing she is almost becoming the mad queen and KL has a big stock of wildfire since Aerys II was crazy about it. Lets remember that before losing the battle for Robert Baratheon the Mad King wanted to blow up KL so Robert would be king of ashes this way of thinking looks a lot like Cerseis like Its not mine so no one can have it.About Jaime Lannister I think he will kill Cersei trying to save the city again fulfilling the Valonqar profecy.I dont think ALL dragons will die I believe Dany will fight the white walkers so theyll be very needed to fight the Night Kings army but Im not saying all of them will survive in s at least one will die it could be because of Euron Greyjoy.,gameofthrones,d6za02d,3,t5_2rjz2

8770361,0,t3_507oop,Meera Lancel Lannister and Hizdahr zo Loraq heres my comment from another thread with a similar question. I think Lancel and Hizdahr were both interesting characters Lancel as the wimpy kid desperate for respect turned religious fanatic and Hizdahr a man who despite his circumstances still wanted to help Daenerys and his people. Theyre both quite tragic so I feel sorry for them. Specially Hizdahr as I think he could have been very helpful for Dany and her circle if they werent so quick to dismiss him even after discovering they wrongfully murdered his innocent father. At least Lancel found some peace and purpose with the Faith and had a memorable death Hizdahr died super quick without anyone ever mentioning him. Plus theyre cute,gameofthrones,d71yklt,6,t5_2rjz2

Hey Geoff this last thousand years was way better than the ones before it. To celebrate lets take this gross mans babies and make them into bad dudes just as tight as the two of us. k I mean its certainly possible. Geoff seems down at least.

The Vale is surrounded by cliffs rocks and mountains leaving them with only one meaningful port. If you include it and dont call it The South like the North is The North Dorne has some easternnortheastern ports! Ghost Hill for instance! ...Unfortunately without a local river it seems like few if any are fairly meaningful ports. Sure you can land your fleet there... But you cant go inland and the coast is rough and terrible. Sure the Stepstones exist off the Broken Arm but unfortunately the Free Cities constantly claim control of the islands. You would be fighting tons of pirates possible Ironborn Reavers and Free Cities fleets. Id say that you are better off just letting the Dornish freak the fuck out and murder any pirate who gets too pokey on their own terms.The only section that matters for ships is the Crownlands and they have the protection of the Master of Ships who orders the Royal Fleet at Dragonstone and can call upon the powerful Celtigars and Velaryons.,gameofthrones,d7bzaj6,1,t5_2rjz2

For Jorah I dont know the whole story of the poachers whether they were poor people desperately trying to feed their family or criminals that would have killed anyone that got in their way if they had a chance.  It varies between being too harsh to outright evil but like Theon Jorah tries to redeem himself later in the story.  Same as Tyrion with some of the things hes done.Tywin never does that.  Everything he does he does for the selfish gain of him and his legacy nothing else.

8902862,0,t3_525s9w,My vote is for Roberts Rebellion. People bitch about we know how it ends. Well we had  books of spoilers to start out the TV series and we all loved it anyway. Also history is written by the victor. I would love to see Roberts Rebellion be much different than what we were given. Even though we know how it would end there would be something sweet about this sceneRhaegar is in the Tower of Joy with Lyanna. She tells him she is pregnant. He smiles says he loves her but he needs to win this war. He leaves her to go face off against the usurper in the battle of the Trident. When you decide to do something new it may not pick up steam. But using characters we all know by name it would make it sweet as hell. Like Star Wars you could do a middle first prequel then the finale.,gameofthrones,d7hzuup,2,t5_2rjz2

Now I dont agree that every decision she has made is bad but she is far from a good queen.Also myopic is really a great way to describe how Dany acts it explains why she just rolls through Astapor and Yunkai without setting up any kind of leadership and why she is so intent on conquering Westeros when she has never even been there and would probably be better off just ruling Slavers Bay.,gameofthrones,d7ikza5,-1,t5_2rjz2

Khal Drogo ignored her when they rode even as he had ignored her during their wedding and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders racing his prize horses watching women dance and men die. Dany had no place in these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone or with Ser Jorah and her brother and afterward to cry herself to sleep. Yet every night some time before the dawn Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind Dothraki fashion for which Dany was grateful that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him her body bruised and sore hurting too much for sleep.gtDay followed day and night followed night until Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer.

9095863,0,t3_54ufdh,Personally I believe its connected to the lady of the flame religion Rhllor. From the show itself the only real connection to fire either comes from wildfire or Melisandre or the brotherhood. And Melisandre has already enacted rituals requiring blood of kings so balls IMO isnt too far of a stretch. Flames are also known in the religion to give off visions as shes already pointed this out a few times that she can see Stannis future in them.Varys claims a voice came from the flame and it haunts him. But it doesnt actually call out to him on a daily basis its just something he remembers. So I believe its not symbolic of something critical to the story but rather foreshadowing and interweaving more of the Rhllor religion into the GOT mythos.,gameofthrones,d856df3,16,t5_2rjz2

However Robert died soon after Ned was executed and a full fledged war broke out while Beric was hunting for the Mountain.This actually leads to an off screen battle at Mummers Ford and Beric is killed by The Mountain but was brought back by Thoros of Myr. Since they were defeated at Mummers Ford and War of the Five Kings had broken out Beric and the remaining survivors were now trapped behind enemy lines.

9173946,0,t3_55t99c,I believe its Jaime at the moment. Its a JonSansa situation where Jon is KITN while Sansa is Lady of Winterfell. I think Cersei is technically the head of the rock since she is Iron Throne Queen but Jaime would be acting Lord...I assume. He isnt in the KG anymore although likely will be reinstated by next season and is the head of the Lannister army so it just makes sense he would be. At end of season  Id say its Jaime. But I am pretty sure that when Tywin died the Rock went to Kevan as acting Lord  Jaime is out as a KG and Cersei is Queen Mother and hasnt lived at Casterly Rock for literally ages. maybe she had it in theory but nobody would refer to her as such I am sure. I got the distinct feeling Kevan was in charge of ol Casterly from Tywins death until Jaime was removed from the KG in season  because then it went back to Jaime. and while Kevan was Hand his wife was probably running shit back in Lannisport. Who else would be? Tyrions written out of sucession Jaime is KG and Cersei is Queen. Kevan is working as the Hand and Kevans only son is a Sparrow so religious KG. Theres nobody left but Kevans offscreen wife assuming to actually be running things as an acting LordLady of the rock. ,gameofthrones,d8ev5u2,1,t5_2rjz2

Almost similarly to Pycelle but much better executed I think Varys undersells his true power or capabilities to appear less dangerous and more trustworthy.

9355471,0,t3_4ktuhq,I think the Dothraki are giving us a glimpse into the future of the rest of Planetos.  The Dothraki Sea used to be a gigantic city which is why it is so flat.  There clearly used to be more advanced civilizations in this space because that is where the Dothraki got the trophies they keep at Vaes Dothrak.  They couldnt have built these and whats more there are fortresses in Westeros that the Westerosi would be incapable of building at the present moment too.Planetos is dying but it is taking thousands and thousands of years to do this slow enough so that it could only be noticed over generations  which I think ties into the Maesters conspiracy and why theyre trying to rid the world of what were calling magic.   When we are finally shown what the rest of their world looks like I think my theory will be confirmed I half expect the map outside of the known world to be either charred black and blown to hell from a meteor impact or some cataclysmic even...  or completely covered in Ghost Grass.Recently in the show they made sure to mention that nobody knows what lies outside the known world.

9413264,0,t3_59kjo7,The seed is strong does not mean a lot for Gendry. He is Roberts son and as a Baratheon his hair is dark. It has nothing to do with Cersei. Also Cersei loves her children so even if he were Roberts its out of character for her to let a son of hers to die. The witch predicted that she would only have  children with blonde hair so I dont see the theory that GendryisCerseis first son as plausible. However Gendry is the true heir of the Seven Kingdoms. Cersei took over because there was a vacuum of heirs so his return does pose a challenge on her claim to the throne. However Gendry does not have any supporters and Dany is coming with a massive army whatever role he plays its unlikely it revolves around him claiming the throne for himself. Also Dany will almost definitely form an alliance with the North not fight them. She has Tyrion as her right hand man and both Stark kids trust him. But I do believe that somehow Daenarys will turn into a villain of sorts. She cant get the throne its just too easy. She will die somewhere along the road and she has shown bouts of sadism so it is likely that she may end up doing something mad and get killed for it.

Does what an army consist of matter when within a sentence describing a nonsensical offscreen moment one will be nearly completely obliterated?

Think about this. Sansa doesnt know the white walkers exist...but does Jon tell her? Nope. Does he tell anybody that doesnt know about them...like Littlefinger...or anybody else at all that he meets? Nope. Doesnt think its worth mentioning.Aryas character was always smart clever and careful right up until episode  then in the very next episode shes just wandering around town without a care in the world even though she knows there is an extremely dangerous assassin trying to kill her. Then she gets stabbed in the gut and thrown in the canal because she allofasudden decided she didnt have to pay attention anymore. wtf? This is completely and totally out of character for her and makes no sense.Also the show keeps sending Jamie off on sidequests that dont amount to anything or have any meaning at all.The reason that all of these scenes have such terrible writing is also the thing they all have in commonGRRM didnt write these scenes yet for them to adapt.To be clear I really liked season  overall but at times the writing was honestly godawful.,gameofthrones,d9nlfjd,26,t5_2rjz2

9616916,0,t3_5cnqix,Since you may have typed this up for me I have thrown you a glorious upvote.  I think your only problem is that the similarities between the wolves and Stark kids have been apparent for so long  years that it has been discussed ad nauseam.  However we do have more books and seasons to work with nowadays though so there are definitely some new things to mull over.  Nymeria was a queen and it may foreshadow Aryas final journey with Gendry.  Last season Arya starts to ponder really out of the blue what is west of Westeros.  In previous seasons she also had a very tight bond with Gendry who referred to her as his Lady.  I dont think Arya will die so her sailing off at the end with Gendry who is a king or prince by some definitions fits the idea that she will be his Queen.Bran is more interesting since Summer dies while Bran is warging.  Perhaps Bran himself will die while warging in another time.  What happens then?  His spirit may live on that way but trapped in another timeline.  This satisfies several theories mainly that Bran may be the original Bran the Builder etc.  There is also the fun idea that whichever of the Stark kids King Robert touched in the first episode dies and it is unclear if he actually touched Bran.  So Brans ultimate fate may be ambiguous.Overall I dont necessarily think the wolves fates are tied to their Stark owner because I think Sansa will for sure survive to rule the Eyrie.  Robert didnt touch her after all.  The wolves do foreshadow a great many other things though as Ladys death certainly revealed that Sansas journey as a Stark came to a sudden end.I couldnt find it but I swear there was a quote somewhere about Ghost outliving them all and I did take that to mean that of all the Stark kids Jon would live the longest.  So maybe Ghost will die of old age... the only direwolf to die a peaceful death.,gameofthrones,d9yhdvn,8,t5_2rjz2

9715372,0,t1_da80bj2, . John Arryn was a mature and experienced Lord and a father figure to both Robert and Ned. Also Ned was only about  years old at the end of the Rebellion and had not grown up expecting to be lord at all as he was a younger brother. Robert needed someone with experience and wisdom to run his kingdom for him and Ned just wasnt that guy yet.Also there must always be a Stark in Winterfel  with his youngest brother at the Wall and his father and elder brother dead Ned was the last Stark at the time well ok I think Robb may have been a baby by that point but can a baby qualify as the Stark in Winterfel?.  He had to go home.Aaand... Ned had just picked up a baby which in Roberts eyes was the bastard born of the rape of his true love and a potential rival for the throne.  In the context of the murder of Rhaegars legitimate children Ned would have wanted to get Jon as far away as possible.Aaand Ned was disgusted by Roberts reaction to the murder of Rhaegars wife and kids and needed a timeout from his company.

9786127,0,t3_5f683p,. Jaimie is Lord Lannister head of House Lannister and Lord of Casterly Rock since Tommen dismissed him from the Guard.. The lesser Houses of the Westerlands now owe loyalty to Jaimie though we dont know if any have done fealty personally for their lands. As such Jaimie can call on the levy of bannermen their followers and the free commoners for military service. He also becomes commander of whats left of the Lannister standing army which was paid from the revenues of the mines that are now empty. . As long as Jaimie accepts Cersei as Queen the lesser Houses should support him. In Roberts Rebellion however some lesser Houses refused the support the position of their liege lords both in the Vale and the Storm Lands. . Cersei has the Crown Lands and the lesser Houses there who owe fealty directly to the Throne. Again the lesser Houses could refuse to support her and her call on the levies. . Tommen received at least one report from his Court about the Sept without the Frankenmountain present so while rumors she killed Tommen can obviously come out it would be outside the Court.. While Tywin created the Lannister and Tyrell alliance it was already unraveling thanks to Cersei allowing the Faith Militant to resurface and giving the Faith power to throw Marjorie and Loras into a dungeon and manufacturing the evidence to make that happen which Ohlenna soon discovered. Cersei moved to keep control of Tommen knowing she had already lost the Tyrells. . Euron is going to raid the western and southern coasts of Westeros perhaps even Oldtown. He certainly didnt build a thousand ships but even  require  sailors and can carry  marines that need food water and firewood not to mention plunder to keep them happy. Unless Cersei negotiates an alliance the Lannisters are going to get hit hard. Lannisport would make a great target and the Lannisters only have  ships left. But an alliance makes sense as Euron wants Yara and Theon dead and theyre supporting Danerys and Cersei need troops. . The other possible alliance if LF is smart and keep control of Lord Robyn and the Council is with the Vale which would give Cersei the cavalry force to oppose the Dothraki no there arent  Dothraki it would take  ships just to carry their horses there are probably  Dothraki max. She could offer LF a place on the Great Council confirm his Lord Protectorship of the Vale and make him Warden of the East. He could then promise to add the River Lands. ,gameofthrones,dajcq6y,1,t5_2rjz2

9835287,0,t1_dapcd63,In the books Varys supposedly saved Rheagars son before the Lannisters sacked Kings Landing and killed everyone. It is heavily hinted at that the kid they have who is now a teenager and has been groomed for the throne his whole life by people on Varys team may just be some random kid they found that looks that part. I dont think the kid is truly a Targaryen which makes me believe Varys doesnt care too much about rightful heir and just wants a good leader on the throne. They purposefully had this kid grow up among common people and work very hard his whole life to survive. I think Varys wanted someone like that to rule rather than an entitled royal who had never truly worked a day in their life and didnt really know the common people they were serving. The showmakers chose not to include this kid who would be Danys nephew if he is who they claim he is in the show storyline so perhaps Varys intentions and motivations are slightly different from the book to show.,gameofthrones,dapk6jf,37,t5_2rjz2

Everything will go well up until that moment the combined might of the King in the North and the Queen of Westeros will look unstoppable and then itll be dashed against the rocks by an unimaginably powerful foe maybe heres when Dany goes Aerys Jr. as the White Walkers converge on Kings Landing and the whole city just goes up in flames or something. All speculation at this point. Then whoevers left if one of them even survives to the end will end up having to rule the ashes of Westeros.   I think that will be the bittersweet ending GRRM envisions and definitely think it would be a tragedy in story telling to have Dany get killed so early after building up her storyline for so long. It would fit ASOIAFs theme but at the same time theres got to be a balance between that and good story telling. ,gameofthrones,dbbsou7,2,t5_2rjz2

10237880,0,t1_dc2rlt9,Well this is impossible for a number of reasons. One Tourney at Harrenhal was  AC Jon Snow was born in . So even if we go by your argument that Robert drunk raped Lyanna at the Tourney and as a result Jon Snow was conceived hed have born earlier than he was. Two from the time Lyanna went missing to being found was over a year. The Rebellion did not start just because she went missing a common misconception. It started after Brandon Stark and Rickard Stark were burned alive and the Mad King demanded Jon Arryn turn over Ned and Robert. This was considerable time after Lyanna went missing. So again she went missing well over a year not  months or less before she was found by Ned and given the baby being a newborn in both books and show it is not possible for Lyanna to have been pregnant when she went missing. Whatever happened to allow for a newborn baby to be born and found by Ned Stark happened after and during the time she was missing.Any additional argument that Jon was not a newborn upon Ned finding him is not possible to be correct. Books do not have super speed jetpack travel like the show sometimes depicts. Ned was thousands of miles in the South and would have taken him months to return to Winterfell with the baby Jon. If Jon was already born at the time Ned found him hed have been much older looking by the time he returns to Winterfell than described in the source material. He is of similar age and similar look to Robb which is part of what angers Catelyn. This means they are of similar age and Jon could not have been months old upon Ned finding him. He was a newborn when Ned found him.All of this is not some accident. It is clever foreshadowing clues about who Jon actually is. There are zero clues that Jon is a Baratheon in both books and show and I dont understand why Jon is a secret Baratheon theory exists. No evidence no clues timeline is impossible changes the entire ToJ scene irrelevant to the plot given the addition of Gendry and Edric Storm and makes the point of Rhaegar what exactly to the plot and end story?,gameofthrones,dc4irbh,1,t5_2rjz2

He chased her and loved her though her skin was cold as ice and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.

10321246,0,t3_5nsanx,Book Better Jaime. His book redemption continues past his return to KL when he goes to the Riverlands. Unfortunately in the show his Dorne trip was somewhat of a disservice to his character development because he was not forced to reconcile his duties as a Lannister commander and oathkeeper to Cat like in the Riverlands. His Riverlands trip in S does accomplish this but not as thoroughly as in the books which is only natural. Show Better The Hound. Rory McCan plays the role so well. His acting and the writing for his character made him feel like a major character to me whereas in the books he seems more like a secondary character and you can only see him through Arya or Sansas eyes. Like Robb Stark in the show he seems more like a proper major character than just another character you get to meet through the unreliable narration of the POVs IMO. ,gameofthrones,dcdyxht,43,t5_2rjz2

The audience can always be confident in what Brienne is up to or what Jon will do and that in turn gives the audience some confidence in their own predictions about where the story is headed.  Audiences like to wonder and predict. These characters while not always exciting are necessary to keep the audience interested  Heres an example of what I mean Its difficult to predict where Arya the Hound and the Red Woman are going or what will happen to them as sole characters right? BUT what we do know is Brienne is going back north to Sansa. Just given probabilities and current geographic trajectories shes likely to cross paths with one or more of these other three characters. Brienne provides a narrative way for the audience to predict outcomes for three otherwise ambiguous plot lines.,gameofthrones,dci5psz,18,t5_2rjz2

10388103,0,t1_dclh93c,I think Tywin expected expected the Crown would still be held Joffrey or Tommen when he made the arrangements. He probably assumed they would use the full force to see to it that their cousin would be made Warden of the North to strengthen the Lannister name. The North facing off against the Westerlands Reach and possibly the Riverlands would be a tall task. The neck is a great natural defense but houses with strong navies wouldnt be as deterred. And Im not so sure that Walter would have backed Roose. Yes his daughter was married to him but he would be risking his own lands and titles by standing up to the crown. Seeing as how he didnt take many risks I dont think hed do much to defend Roose until the Boltons were assured victory which might never happen. He was concerned with marrying his daughters off not keeping them in power. He had dozens of kids. If given the choice between sacrificing Riverrun or the Twins and seeing his daughters head chopped off hed choose his daughter to die. ,gameofthrones,dclk1ha,2,t5_2rjz2

The gags arent quite as cringe inducingly feast or famine in the vein of Family Guy but theres a lot redundant schtick throughout all the episodes Ive seen and after a while Im left wondering if this isnt more sketch comedy than an actual show. Ricks a loose cannon Mortys neurotic they go to weird places hilarity ensues. Thats really it as far as Ive seen anyway. Theres nothing all that subversive or clever and its basically just visually rich wackiness which is fine. Just not brilliant like people say.Its derivative because there are obvious debts owed to Back to the Future Doctor Who Futurama and various movies like Inception and Nightmare on Elm St over the course of the proceedings. Thats not necessarily a bad thing either. The Venture Brothers weaves tapestries of referential humor to great effect. Theres multilayered nods to other facets of pop and nerd culture sometimes youll get two or three in one sentence alone. Each episode is loaded with these. RampM seem to just get stuck in one familiar concept and use it as a jumping off point into wouldnt it be funny if material. It works more often than not but tends to get stale.Plus Adam Reed came up with the whole burping while talking thing. Im not sure if Dan Harmon consciously lifted it but every time I hear Rick do it I think of how Xander Crews did it first.,gameofthrones,dcso15a,0,t5_2rjz2

10576349,0,t3_5rc7tu,Theon had pledged his loyalty and honor to Robb.  In a feudal society THAT individual sense of honor and worth came before family. When Theon broke his oath to Robb he lost a great deal of personal credit with the Ironborn and everybody else in a feudal society like Westeros even though he went with his blood over his honor. Theres the story of a Roman general captured by the Carthaginians who was sent to Rome to negotiate a Roman surrender or face death. The Roman general went to Rome told the Senate to keep fighting and returned to Carthage and was tortured and crucified. Theon was also a hostage under a treaty between the Ironborn and the King in Kings Landing. What Theon should have done was return to Robb and ask him to release him of his oath so he could join his father as his heir while formally announcing his fathers rejection of the treaty or agreement which had made him a hostage. Robbs response should of been to release Theon of his oath to Robb but then place him in detention as a hostage to his father holding to the terms of the treaty to keep the Ironborn of the western coasts of the North. Theons personal honor would be clean and his status as a hostage could lead to attempts to retrieve him from Robb so his father could denounce the treaty and return to raiding the western coasts and looking to add land on those coasts to his holdings.,gameofthrones,dd6v8zp,1,t5_2rjz2

10634863,0,t3_5s77go,Well Arya is very young and whatever she feels towards Gendry at that time she will not be able to understand it. But she cant control her behaviour and there are hints already there. Arya noticing a shirtless GendrygtShe climbed to the roof and peeked down. Gendry was beating out a breastplate. When he worked nothing existed for him but metal bellows fire. The hammer was like part of his arm. She watched the play of muscles in his chest and listened to the steel music he made. Hes strong she thought. Arya ACoKAnother example when Lady Smallwood puts Arya in her first dress when arriving at Acorn Hall what was Gendrys reaction? Read more analysis here gtYou can still make swords if you want said Arya. You can make them for my brother Robb when we get to Riverrun.gtRiverrun. Gendry put the hammer down and looked at her. You look different now. Like a proper little girl.gtI look like an oak tree with all these stupid acorns.gtNice though. A nice oak tree. He stepped closer and sniffed at her. You even smell nice for a change.gtYou dont. You stink. Arya shoved him back against the anvil and made to run but Gendry caught her arm. gtShe stuck a foot between his legs and tripped him but he yanked her down with him and they rolled across the floor of the smithy. He was very strong but she was quicker. Every time he tried to hold her still she wriggled free and punched him. Gendry only laughed at the blows which made her mad. He finally caught both her wrists in one hand and started to tickle her with the other so Arya slammed her knee between his legs and wrenched free. Both of them were covered in dirt and one sleeve was tom. On her stupid acorn dress. I bet I dont look so nice now she shouted.,gameofthrones,ddcwl7u,26,t5_2rjz2

10661191,0,t1_ddfcv3y,I dont know man.  When he its Arya he immediately states it isnt because she never beat him in swords.  That can be said being a young girl and boy he assumed himself and Arya because he was just learning he can see the past hence why it confused him to who the girl was if she was beating him.  He clearly mistook Benjen for himself.  There was no way hed mention Arya not beating him then.  Unless GRRM did a shitty job in writing that part.    If youre wanting her to be a looker youll see it as Lyanna was mistaken as Arya because of her beauty.  In real life you can look very similar to someone but still not be as attractiveugly as them.  If youre wanting her to be ugly youll see it as my way.    Saying barring the for a change is no different than me saying Its an insult barring you look nice.  Youre removing half the sentence.    Every argument I have read about her being attractive is all assumptions and opinions unfortunately.  We will have to wait to hear GRRM say it.,gameofthrones,ddfmcvb,1,t5_2rjz2

In GoT the seasons have no bearing on the year Bran is  at the start of the show and has never seen a winter Tyrion says hes seen  winters and hes supposed to be in his early s in the books.

Blowing up the citadel got rid of two things the high sparrow and his army and Marjorie who controlled her son. And the level of mad genius that it must of took for her to decide on that course of action rather than to escape the kingdom or face death gave me a lot of respect for her despite knowing shes about to go off the deep end now that shes lost all her children and gained the iron throne.

In doing that he had to do the most dishonorable thing a father can imagine.  In his mind though it was the only way to guarantee success in his claim.  His honor which he sees as the kings honor is more valuable to him than his daughter or honoring her.

11101232,0,t3_5yff9w,I would say that it might be better to watch the show first just because from everything Ive read on the internet people who have read the books first seem much more butthurt about the changes that the show has made and because of that they dont enjoy the show as much as those who have not read the books. So if you want to enjoy the show watch it first and then read the books to get a more deeper and a bit different version of the story. But note that there is no guarantee that the books will actually ever finish since it takes GRRM so long to write them. I personally did not like the books as much as most people to me they were mostly boring and had a lot of problems that should have been taken care of in the editing process before publishing. But everyone have different tastes so... I really wanted to like the books because I read a lot and I was already a fan of the world and the characters because of the show but I just couldnt get into the story while I was reading it.,gameofthrones,deqbcjt,1,t5_2rjz2

Riverrun is a place where Jaime has had to make decisions between what Cersei asks of him and what Brienne asks of him. My argument is about Jaime. We dont need to factor Cersei and Briennes motives into the equation to see that Jaime is making choices where Brienne and Cersei are concerned.Hes still choosing between following Brienne or returing to Cersei in Kings Landing.

Its the most popular show of all time and the showrunners decided to give it a proper ending. I have no doubt that its going to be spectacular. We will all miss it dearly but they are going out on an absolute high point. Game of Thrones is like no other television experience ever. Its a once in a lifetime thing. I will be forever indebted to George for creating this world and Benioff and Weiss for bringing it to life.

11177271,0,t3_5zkqbg,gtI dont think she was posing the entire time she was with TyrionThey exchanged abbreviated marriage vows on multiple occasions. Shae was given an opportunity from Varys to cash out and live comfortably the rest of her life if she left of her own free will which she refused so she could stay with Tyrion. I think she was in love with Tyrion but it was an immature love and his sending her away and calling her a whore broke her. Tyrion hurt her and she was going to do everything in her power to hurt him back just as much.gtand it didnt seem like she was being coerced either.I think she was coerced but not against her will. Cersei most likely offered her a deal and she jumped at it to hurt Tyrion the fact that she was rewarded was a bonus.gtAnybody got any theories or was this cleared up later and I missed it?I think the interesting thing youre missing is that Tywin took his sons whore the same son he forbade to have a whore in the capitol. Tywin is a man famous for hating whores. He has his fathers mistress marched naked from Casterly Rock never to be seen again after his father died. So why does Tywin take Shae? Because he hates Tyrion for taking his wife she died in childbirth so taking Tyrions woman is a way of getting back at his son for the crime of murdering his wife. Tyrion has loved  women Tysha and Shae Tywin has taken them both away from Tyrion.So why does Shae go to Tywin?Because she knows the story of Tysha and she knows nothing would hurt Tyrion more than the thought of Shae with Tywin.Even if Tyrion never finds out just the idea of Tyrion hearing about Tywin taking Shae gives them both great pleasure.,gameofthrones,deyxj20,3,t5_2rjz2

11393001,0,t1_dfnd5xt,gtLol its not a bowl because of the rose bowl. Its a bowl because of what a bowl is a stadium or arena for contest. In this situation it would be an arena for the Cleganes hence Clegane bowl. Dont make things up  I didnt maybe try researching it yourself. A stadium is where American football is played not a bowl. A stadium can LOOK like a bowl it can even have bowl in the name but the term as its being used in this context came from the event known as the Rose Bowl which took place at the Rose Bowl Stadium. This was the first location that was used for bowl games. Bowl games were a post season game played by college students that prior to  would not count against their statistics for the season but instead it was an exhibition match and the winning team recieved a reward for victory.Now bowl is synonymous with any major football event such as the Super Bowl Pro Bowl or Iron Bowl. In these cases the term Bowl refers to the type of event not the building. In the case of Clegane Bowl were talking about an exhibition match between Sandor and Gregor not the arena that they would fight in.,gameofthrones,dfndpc2,2,t5_2rjz2

I would note that the effects of the weather and climate in the North will also take a toll on the Westerosi forces from the south  troops from Dorne the Stormlands and the Reach are going to struggle adapting to the climate in the far North. Still there is the assumption that Dany is going to go directly to the North  this is not the case. She doesnt know about the White Walkers and what they represent so her current objective remains reclaiming the Iron Throne which is far enough in the south that she wont experience troop loss due to weather quite yet. ,gameofthrones,dfuispg,2,t5_2rjz2

When Tyrion asks to be given Casterly Rock as it is his by rights Tywin tells him Mens laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. This goes to show that there is the possibility that Tyrion is not actually his legitimate child. I believe part of Tywin always knew that Tyrion was the bastard of King Aerys but refuses to believe it much like he refused to believe Jamie and Cersei were lovers. ,gameofthrones,dfyg0r6,2,t5_2rjz2

11527383,0,t1_dg2kxnt,Hes definitely more than a warg. Hes a greenseer. I think only greenseers can go into weirwood.net. When Varamyr talks about meeting other skinchangers they have all kinds of animals but nobody mentions any trees.  Hes holding a root when they first go in. He always touches a tree before going into weirwood.net even his last time when he sees RLJ. He definitely lets go of the root but hes still in the past for the hold the door stuff. Im not sure if hell be able to access weirwood.net without touching a tree in the future itd definitely be cool if he could but it seems like he does at least right now.  I dont know if youve read the books and I cant remember the scene when Bran meets the EC in the show so possible spoilers ahead Spoilers ExtendedBookss but the EC is Brynden Rivers or Bloodraven. He was a bastard of Aegon IV. He was sent to the wall by Aegon V. He became Lord Commander then he disappeared north of the wall. When Bran meets him in the books he says something about having a thousand eyes and one which is a direct reference to Bloodraven. So I disagree with the idea that he will become the EC and wait for himself to arrive.  As for being Bran the Builder I doubt that one too. According to legend Bran the Builder was supposed to have raised the Wall and Winterfell. He may have also helped Durran build Storms End. Sounds to me like hed have to physically be there for that and so far all we know is that he may be able to speak to people in the past. Unless he gets a few serious power upgrades I dont see it happening. Bran is just a common Stark name. Lots of Brandon Starks throughout history. ,gameofthrones,dg2mprk,2,t5_2rjz2

11545814,0,t3_64r3lk,I personally loved Catelyn.  She was fiercely devoted to her family and wanted justice for Bran even though it may not have been the right move.  When she captured Tyrion she was not planning on it.  She was sitting in a bar fostering hate for Tyrion Lannister and then he shows up and starts talking like his usual sarcastic self.  He pissed her off and she judged the situation and made a rash decision.  Later everything she does is to undo her actions and save her family.  That is why she goes to Renly that is why she has Brienne take Jaime back to get her daughters and why she negotiates with Walder Frey.  She may have made some stupid decisions but that was because she made decisions with her heart and not always her brain.

I want to take care of my family do my job to my fullest extent and live a life free of deceit and lies. However living in Turkey I have to watch out constantly and play the game of thrones which is not entirely what Im interested in or something Im good at. Its a realm filled with Pycelles and Littlefingers and Varyss led by Maegor the Cruel instead of Joffrey i.e. a lessthanlikable man whos nevertheless on top of his stuff.As a prospective academician its not enough that Im competent.

11725298,0,t3_67b10t,I am not certain but i believe shadow binding is a separate skill from what the red priests normally learn and Melisandre just happens to have studied it. Red priests do learn pyromancy fire visions and most shocking of all resurrection. Where does these powers come from? Is it really the Lord of Light? Is he real? I wish we knew.The old gods are the only ones that we know for sure are real. That is we know for sure that the power bestowed upon their worshipers does in fact come from them. We still dont know for sure if the Weirwoods ARE the old gods or just a physical manifestation of them.The faith of the Seven is similar to real world Christianity worshiped in mass as the dominant one true religion very unmystical and if you ask me very boring.The many faced god is not really a religion its the opposite in fact the believe that all gods invented by man are just different faces of death itself and all men will be claimed by death eventually but some must die sooner than others. I used to believe the faceless men had a greater mission but they really seem to just kill people who want to die or people who they get paid to kill so they are really just a sect of superassassins in the end.The drowned god this cruel bastard of a religion has so far done nothing of note.

11749003,1,t1_dgrr3sb, The Sand Snakes led by Ellaria Sand seizing power in Dorne and being taken seriously. Olenna being in charge of house Tyrell and making alliances and plots in the name of the Reach despite her being a Redwyne and not even a Tyrell. Cersei inheriting the Iron Throne after Tommens death.   That awkward scene where the ironborn were about to elect YaraAsha.I know many of these things happened because they had to simplify stuff from the books but its no coincidence that they chose to do it by giving power to the biggest number of women possible. Even Sansa who didnt become Queen in the North technically controls the Vale because Littlefinger is loyal to her not Jon. And dont get me wrong I loved it when the first badass women started rocking but now it has become way too ridiculous.

11761803,0,t3_67sxfb,A lot of great theorys have already been said. If everything worked out for Robb.... He would have married Roslin Frey. Securing K Frey soldiers to solidify his march on Casterly Rock. . Robb doesnt kill Lord Karstark and the  Karstarks army dont march home. Again k soldiers to help defend the Riverlands or march with Robb to Casterly Rock. . He doesnt get involved with TalisaJeyne. . The Edmure mistake doesnt happen. This is huge because had Edmure allowed the Mountain a the bulk of the Lannister forces deeper into Robbs territory as planned by Robb than Robbs army would have surrounded Tywin and destroyed his forces from all sides. Edmures mistake makes the Lannisters switch directions and join the Tyrells to relieve KL. . Jaime is not freed and remains a prisoner. I dont think an exchange would have been made since Jeoffrey wouldnt have let her go. If anything he would have killed Sansa. . Theon does convince the Iron Islands to harass the Lannisters shores and join the war on Robbs side.  These items going right would mean Robb successfully marches on and takes major cities of Casterly Rock and Lannisport. With no army to defend them the Westerlands are easily taken and Tywin must capitulate or sue for peace with the North. Whether or not peace is made i cant even guess. But with Robbs victories and stronger alliance its fair to say he is in the drivers seat as far as the war goes. At this point its very likely he would have heard from other Houses regarding alliances. Perhaps marrying Sansa if returned via trade or trickery to Tristane of Dorne Robin of the Vale cousins but its not out of question or even Loras of the Reach if they break or dont ally themselves with Tywin. Robb was a lot closer to achieving his war plans than most people realize. He nearly routed Tywin and won the war. The items above caused his cause to fail and lose support but had he kept up with everything in line than he would be the undisputed King in the North and lord of  kingdoms essentially made up of the Riverlands Westerlands North and Iron Islands though I wouldnt call it a Kingdom. ,gameofthrones,dgt8aa8,2,t5_2rjz2

11764577,0,t1_dgss9se,He didnt know her exact identity but I think that he knew that she was some kind of nobility in the North.  Its just that he didnt care about any Northern nobility except the Starks and he never thought that she could be a Stark.  ,gameofthrones,dgtjm2g,7,t5_2rjz2

11768251,0,t1_dgt48nt,Agreed at least in the show I dont think they will be able to work that in because something that big couldnt or shouldnt be rushed but could it happen in the books and this be another way the show is different?  I havent read the books calm down! been busy with school and work but I just got the set for my birthday so Ill get to it immediately! but I know the show has changed a lot of things so could this be another way they are different because of time limitations?,gameofthrones,dgtyn3y,0,t5_2rjz2

11774527,0,t1_dgumm3v,I get that. I read the spoiler policy. I agree its not a spoiler.All Im saying is that by initimating that the age of the comic lends itself to not being a spoiler whether that was your intention or not you open the door for people to post spoilers and argue its been a long enough time its no longer a spoiler.People will use loopholes and technicalities as far as they can.,gameofthrones,dguoecm,3,t5_2rjz2

11805694,0,t3_68coui,I love the foreshadowing right at the beginning of se. When Robb meets Walder and he is pretty much insulting Robb for almost  minutes and at the end Walder says The wine will flow red music will play loud and we will put this mess behind us.,gameofthrones,dgy7ski,2,t5_2rjz2
