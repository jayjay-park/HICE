69771,0,t1_cem9iy7,What are you doing to make friends? Its harder when youre an adult than when youre young. You dont just get dumped in a room with  other people roughly your age for hours every day anymore like you did in grade school. You dont have organized social functions where everyone from your entire extended circle of acquaintances shows up like you did in high school. You have to make an effort to meet people. You have to go out and do something. Find an activity youve always wanted to try and find a way to start doing it. Talk to the people there. You know you have at least one thing in common with them so thats a start. Maybe you have other interests in common too. Those will come out over time. If the first activity you try doesnt work out try another one.Knowing nothing about you my suggestions Join a sport. Team or individual doesnt matter much as long as people practice or play at a regular time. Go to bar trivia either alone or with your lady friend and start talking to the tables near you. Find your local beer brewing group. Learn to dance. Take your girlfriend. My personal experience is that swing and salsa are more social than ballroom. Get politically active. Make calls. Knock on doors. Talk to the other people you work with. Not an activity but knock on your neighbors doors and introduce yourself. Talk to them when you see them after that. Invite them over for dinner or for a drink or to watch your TV show of choice.,CrazyIdeas,cemdezg,1,t5_2snxj

Even with top notch schools a child needs a completely nurturing environment for proper development. Considering children spend majority of their time at home and with parents schooling would have to massively supplement their growth. Unmovtivated parents simply wouldnt be driven to provide enough stimuli for their children.Its not that people with aspergers wouldnt be useful to society they just wouldnt provide the same input.

Yes we have the best because our system generates the most money and attracts the best.  But it saves lives while simultaneously destroying them.Our roads might be nice but a regrading of asphalt now and then doesnt make up for our larger decaying infrastructure.  Bridges in particular are aging and in serious states of disrepair.  Were stuck in a holding pattern.  We maintain our interstates but we arent replacing much or improving the system.  Look at our railways as well for another example of stagnation.  We have a budget for repair but no new bigticket items.Our schools are okay.  colleges yesthey can be fantastic.  But tuition rates in colleges are suffering from the same problem as healthcare.  Costs are skyrocketing making them inaccessible to the majority because theres only room for the bestpaying.  Affordable colleges are useless diploma mills and public education k is chronically underfunded poorly staffed and in similar decay to our transportation infrastructure.Were not living in a country with a stable infrastructure.

Once modeled or if failure to model as occurs in infant blindness there is tremendous lack of plasticitycorrection of these visual analytic pathways in adolescent or adult life. This plan will most likely visually cripple the child permanently.I am also pretty sure the Daredevil sensory thing is  myth and only marginal gains are observed though please link any articles indicating otherwise as I would be interested.Btw this is also why you refrain from eyepatch use in small children when possible say after eye trauma especially when you only patch one eye this would cause dyssynchrony in neural pathway remodeling from the right and left visual fields. .....so maybe start the blindfold ceremony at  years old?

Interesting Idea but as we increase energy demand we would be taking that energy from the Moons orbital rotation slowly slowing it down to the point that it may eventually crash into the Earth. There is also the incredible initial cost of resources engineering the giant bridges over the middle of the ocean building a bridge across the bearing straight is hard enough maintaing it all and engineering enough Spider Silk a technology that is still in its infancy to reach the moon and hold it with enough strength to not break.

Honestly I reckon you could get away with constantly alternating just be claiming youre trying to learn which works best  weeks in a term is  weeks for each option spread it over two terms and you can do fortnights without without having extra days by the time anyone figures it out theyre finished for the year and youll probably never have them again.,CrazyIdeas,d1r1jpv,2,t5_2snxj

However you may feel that you prefer the higher chance of a smaller reduction in life expectancy to the instant death.So then you skew it so that its  chance of losing  years versus  chance of losing  years.

If thats a million dollars youre betting and it turns into trillions of dollars in earnings then everyone comes out better. Even the rich man who paid in a larger sum at the start got more out of the final prize because his bet was magnified by everyone else chipping in. Maybe theres a cut off at the top that if someone paid so much of the initial fee that he was basically  of it then it doesnt work out for him. But still when the casino loses on that jackpot bet all the recipients of the prize are more likely to come out better off than had they not pooled their bet.

9851811,0,t1_daqwwlf,Theres much more to understand about it. The reason why it feels better to smoke when youre drinking alcohol is because alcohol and nicotine both use the same receptors in your brain the GABA receptors to be precise. Thats why they suppress each other alcohol suppresses nicotine much more than the other way around and thats the reason why you smoke more cigarettes when youre drunk. Due to conditioning you dont even have to be drunk. As soon as your taste buds inform your brain that youre drinking alcohol it immediately anticipates the lack of nicotine and makes you light a cigarette.,CrazyIdeas,darpp9t,2,t5_2snxj

9889514,0,t1_dawk4o0,Im not blaming the officers Im blaming the system that refuses to account for these inequalities. You can just appeal to the status quo and defend these ridiculous outcomes to defend the officers who Im not blaming. There is  reason to defend a system that even administrators say they are ill equipped to resolve issues noncoercively or violently.There exists  tools in an officers toolkit arrest or kill deescalation is arguably much more important and is severely lacking.Its ridiculous we live in a system where calling our protectors automatically escalates a system rather than deescalate. A police force who I cant call on my own brother because Im afraid they would kill him creates a much unsafer world especially in high poverty and high mental health issue environments.U.S. Department of Justice condemning various police practices in Baltimore. What has gone largely unmentioned however is the reports detailed review of how encounters between police and people with mental illnesses result in unnecessarily violent confrontations.Pulling a gun on an individual who is experiencing distress only escalates the situation and increases the chance someone will be harmed.When Ive had an individual lunge at me the last thing I would use is a gun as someone who has worked in the mental health and school system. I would rather use nonlethal force. Even the act of pulling a gun pulls for a more violent encounter as you mentioned because the perp feels their options are limited to assault or death when they cant regulate their emotions.If someone in your family had a mental breakdown would you try to give them space and calm them from a distance or hold them at gunpoint and yell at them until they comply? Its a counterproductive and dangerous approach.My life is not more valuable than those who aim to cause me nonfatal harm. If I could choose between being assaulted and committing homicide I would pick being assaulted every time.,CrazyIdeas,dawmkf0,1,t5_2snxj

We need the jobs people are doing to be good enough to support and sustain our population... The sick truth is that most of the people these days are unnecessary and the weird truth is that it is getting increasingly more efficient to just give them an apartment with a tiny grocery budget and say... live just dont be an asshole or well take ur shit away... i know everybody wants to make millions and save the children and a bunch of other bs... but really you guys just need to get comfortable in your little box and learn to live with less so that those who are doing it... can.,CrazyIdeas,dc7guoi,-3,t5_2snxj

They think his cabinet picks are experts in their offices because of their corporate experience and they consider Obamas selection of career politicians as swampy. So really what we consider to be adding corruption to Washington is in many Republicans eyes a step towards the solution. Some will have a problem with the wall but I think most will actually more or less buy Trumps explaination that it isnt necessary because of existing structures and natural barriers. Id even wager that eventually most will even say something along the lines of actually we dont need a wall Trump said we could do less to get the same result hes so smart!. Yeah the lack of wall isnt gonna sink Trump anymore than Gitmo sank Obamas second term. And really most of the Republicans still dont seem to believe the Russia connection.

This is a super basic concept of linguistics that you dont seem to be willing to accept.So based on your theory if enough people use that crap thats now what everyone uses. Bahahahahahahahaha! Yeah no. Language does change over time when we introduce new words or change syntax but what we do not change are the basic meanings of words. Fuck means the same thing now as it did  years ago when they said ye fucketh. This was a change because people are retarded and if youre happy to let that slide good for you. But I have standards and I will uphold them.gtYou sex chromosomes tell you your sex. Not your gender. This is a really basic concept. Gender isnt real its the social construct of roles and expectations about sexes.Christ on his bloody cross youre actually an ape. You keep dragging intersex out like theyre something that proves your point. Intersex people are abnormal. It is that simple. If you want a classification there you go.Ill make it simple. If you have normal chromosomes and normal hormone levels you act in a certain way. Thats not a societal construct thats biology. Because of testosterone men will always be more aggressive and because of oestrogen women have emotional swings due to altering levels through their ovulation cycle. Thats biology and no amount of you telling me society makes men act like men or makes women act like women is going to change that. If you dont act in accordance with your chromosomes and your hormones youre abnormal. It is that simple. gtIts not that simple. Hormone therapy is really complicated and giving someone a big dose of hormones to try to change a psychological characteristic is borderline impossible.Lmao no it isnt. You start at a small dose and work your way up. If it didnt work hormone replacement therapy wouldnt be used LOL.Im actually done with you.
