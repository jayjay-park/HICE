2321807,0,t3_2lsu3j,Unless striving for a badge Id only checkin once per growler per night.I checkin my beers towards the end to see if my opinion changes throughout the beer I note how many ounces I drank and what source e.g. oz growler oz draught oz bottle and then any comments. This is so that I can look back at my ratings and know what were small oz samples what were pints on draught etc.I rarely buy a lot of any one beer right now so I suppose I dont come across your situation often. You should do what you value more are you looking for how many times youve had a beer or how many unique beers youve had. If its the latter then adding a string of the same beer doesnt add value to your catalog. ,Untappd,clyotlh,3,t5_2vnul

The brewery only does lagers and the wild beaver is the Oregon state football version of the wildcat offence.The double ipa is from fearless up in the mountains in Oregon.

5797801,0,t3_3uin2l,There are a couple things going on here so Im going to unpack it for you.First as has already been mentioned users create all beers. This leaves a lot of room for mistakes and duplicates and thats what we Superusers spend most of our time dealing with. So theres not really any way to know if any beer is completely correct but in general ones with labels will be good since that means one of us or the brewery had to edit it.Second any beer can have a vintage added. For a while we tried to have rules that limited which beers could have vintages added but its hard to draw the line and people added bad ones so we sort of just gave up. Thats why you see so many now.Third why do people add vintages? In some cases its because of things you alluded to like tracking how the beer changes with time comparing different years to each other etc. But most people do it because vintages are a separate unique entry so its a way to make your numbers go higher. Crass but Untappd gamifies beer drinking so not surprising.Finally what should you do? Whatever you want it doesnt matter. If you dont find vintages for Sucks helpful then dont use them. If you want to make your numbers bigger then go ahead. Theres no Untappd god who will judge you for this.,Untappd,cxfrt63,3,t5_2vnul
5846873,0,t3_3uin2l,Sucks used to be an annual release right around Xmas which is why there are multiple vintages.  Since they shifted it to year round production there shouldnt be any more.,Untappd,cxm1x87,1,t5_2vnul
5891867,0,t1_cxry1q8,I dunno Ive been beating the we need more mods drum for years now. I think its nontrivial to find them.,Untappd,cxryhyy,3,t5_2vnul
5956854,0,t3_3v2wj9,Myselfand a little sad to say this! but yes Im guilty of rating certain styles of beer at lower ratings due to being less wild about that style. However I always note on those checkins that more than likely my lower rating is because Im less wild about that style of beeri.e. DIPA pale ale any beer thats excessively hoppy.On the flip side of things at least using Untappd has made me realize certain styles of beers arent totally bad and can actually be often decent especially sours and coffee beers.,Untappd,cy0h36u,1,t5_2vnul
5979805,0,t3_3xa2pe,I think they should also separate countries and states into different badges. Drinking in  different countries is far more impressive than  different states. ,Untappd,cy3hf08,5,t5_2vnul

7985458,0,t3_4ol8n1,I am primarily badgedriven which initially meant I was taking pictures with every checkin adding locations toasting others checkins and sharing on social media. Now that I have maxed out most of those badges I really only worry about unique beers and new locations. I will still add photos and toast others checkins but not nearly as frequently. I dont often comment on my own checkins but will comment on checkins from friends. I typically do not focus on particular badges outside of whats new in the Special category but focusing on unique beers has led me to try a lot of different styles and breweries that I would not have tried before I started using Untappd.,Untappd,d4dn3cm,2,t5_2vnul
