Removing someone elses powers that arent Void would make them one but at the same strength they were before.  So not terribly impressive Duration is something I havent talked a lot about but is more solid in my mind essentially you can regrow whats taken from you under most circumstances.  Thats how Bishop gets his voice back how some powertaking is only temporary etc.  Kings had a lot of time to learn exactly how much to take to enable this and how much he needed to take if he just wanted to destroy it completely.,reostra_prompts,d6n8sgj,3,t5_385jb
