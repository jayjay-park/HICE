279718,0,t3_1xb3ni,Most likely in Greek spelling your surname is  gikas which is a relatively common surname in Greece and sometimes its also a first name. From what I could see on Google Ghikas seem to be commonly found in Greek families of AlbanianArvanitic and Vlach descent. Theres a hellenised Romanian royal house named GhicaThe etymology doesnt seem to be clear. A possibility is that it is a  diminutive of the common Greek name Angelos.,GREEK,cf9r7gv,3,t5_2qpo8

Whether you find them silly or not the language is easy to follow.As for American TV shows Id recommend you watch simple shows like Seinfeld. If you keep on watching them season after season you get used to the accents from certain characters which makes it easier for you to understand without subtitles.Good luck!,GREEK,cgmku0a,1,t5_2qpo8

2922077,0,t3_2tli99,The human genome project like anything else in science will create controversy. The first issue and maybe one of the biggest that this project faces is how this takes place within religion. Many like myself believe that God has a plan for everyone. In this case altering someone sic genetics is like altering Gods sic plan. After going into further research though I was able to see that the government provides research from the ELSI for people like myself to look into in how doctors are looking to approach religious and philosophical perspectives. My fear of the human genome project is that many may corrupt the system like many other medical approaches have already been. If people like us doctors or even the government can find to assure that this will be the case that sic I can say that I do support the human genome project. If it can be conducted for only necessary life or death situations such as a child born with life threatening disease than sic I do support this approach.Now that I support this project another thought about this project is who really will have access to it? Since it has already had a minor introduction for people to genetically alter their childrens trait sic it is obvious that it is extremely costly and only available to those with extreme wealth. Will that be the case if the human genome project goes completely global internationally? If the cost of the project is so high over time we will see that only the elite wealthy will have access and eventually they will sic be the only people whose lives will be prolonged. If physicians in programs like the peace core sic can use this project to aid and heal dying children in third world countries than sic this will be a world phenomenon. However if that procedure only falls in the hands of the elite like many other surgical procedures over time we will know the top  percent will be taking over the world with their perfect genes endless years of age! Again I do support the human genome project and if done correctly it can change the world in an amazing way but I do fear of the many problems it can cause as well!If anybody wants to take a look into the ELSI programs research database feel free check this link out. ,GREEK,co08z6g,4,t5_2qpo8

5380207,0,t3_3opw52,Imperatives of Modern Greek verbs can be found in two aspects perfective  aka momentary and imperfective  aka continuous. Verbs have different stems that mark their different aspect an easy way to see the different stems is comparing the stem in the present tense and the stem in the aorist tense. In this case  is the nd person singular perfective imperative. It uses the same stem as the aorist . is the nd person singular imperfective imperative. It uses the same stem as the present tense .They are used differently as the perfective one has the connotation of do X once! while the imperfective means keep doing X!. Now I see that you mention    which means there is some confusion here.To get the easiest out of the way first  is a contraction of   the perfective imperative  it ie put it!. and  are perfective forms of the verb but they are not the imperative. In fact those forms of the verb cannot be used alone. You only use them to form the complex tenses tenses which require auxiliary words to be formed like the future simple tense futuremarking particle       you will put and others. It also forms the perfectivesimple subjunctive which is marked with particles like the most commonly used  eg     I want to put an end. ,GREEK,cvzdreu,13,t5_2qpo8

9610020,0,t3_5cls7t,I guess youre confused due to having heard the first example in colloquial speech well its not grammatically correct.Putting it simply the Genitive case functions like the English preposition of indicating possession. So in the first example youre basically saying Im selling it initial  Georges.The English to was the function of the Dative case but due to old sound changes and the final  droppingthey dativeaccusative begun to sound too similar its function got subsumed by   accusative   gt .So you got       Im selling the car to George.        Im selling Georges car.    Im selling   Georges   car is exactly the same word order as the English translation above and an exact equivalent but with a different emphasis compared to the previous one.      thats the same thing again putting emphasis on the car.,GREEK,d9xmqg3,5,t5_2qpo8

Seeing an official document sort of written when they were in Cyrpus with his name written with a K... I can pretty much believe his name was spelt with a K. Knowing how his name was spelt is something Ive always wanted to know. Thanks so much! Hope youve had a wonderful week! Wish you all the best for the weekend!  ,GREEK,daevbx1,2,t5_2qpo8
10087844,0,t3_5k51ga,If he is what I would call a frontistirio kid I would advise you as a GreekAmerican just stop learning Greek for the sake of a young infatuation and run the fuck away no matter his looks and alot of Greeks tend to not age well with all the chain smoking and other bad lifestyle habits coupled with being in a country with intense sun most months of the year. In Greece parents who have means do everything and spoil their kids  ruining them for life and chances are if he is interacting with an English speaking women his family has means. Their only job is to go to a public school then extra private schooling called frontistirio to get good enough grades on the  to get a spot in a state university. Almost all the people in this milieu especially if he is good looking are only good for clubbing and babysitting coffees for record hours and waning banalities images impressed their fellow spoiled shit friends. Not to mention Greek youth are contradictally extremely male chauvinist and cheesily romantic in the manner depicted in shitty American movies or Antonis Remos songsomfg you dont want to know who that shit stain hack crooner is. Every Greek male in Greece I have encountered if they want olives water a napkin will say what they want and it is expected that their wifesistermother will get up and get it. I have never been in the houseapartment of a Greek from Greece where a man has gotten anything at meal time for himself or did any significant domestic work. Anyway I am just ranting because I am sick of frontistirio kids and this is not what you wanted  but this is what you need to know. You seriously dont know what you are getting into with Greek men raised in Greece. ,GREEK,dbmgp1h,-2,t5_2qpo8
