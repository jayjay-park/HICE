11252770,0,t3_60j0vt,Youre not going to be able to fit all of that into those days. Namibia is very spread out especially in the south and if you want to get to Luderitz Kolmanskop youll have to make  of a circle from the B to the B to B. Its not possible unless you want to drive all day and into the night or go extremely quickly.This is an amibitious plan. As much as I love the south thats gonna be the hardest thing to fit in. I also think if you can you should spend more time actually seeing things Sossusvlei for example than just staying there and breezing through. You should at the very least double your time here.,Namibia,df7hgq6,3,t5_2sg39
