428362,0,t3_1yziy1,Hey mate the workhorse of any outandabout vape is the EVOD  Vapeking stock them here  Youll want to get some replacement coils as well  I prefer the lower ohm coils like the .ohm. Basically the lower the ohm the more watts  more vapour.Dont know what more to say EVODs are fantastic for the price. If you can afford to spend  on a tank the bees knees at the moment is the Kanger Aerotank   You will be blown away.I also sell EVODs on my site but I think that vapeking is more of a onestopshop for a lot of hardware whereas I mainly do juice. ,aussievapers,cfp5y6f,2,t5_2xo3j

He immediately replied being very apologetic and said what you originally ordered has now been packed and sent. Two days later received my package with a couple of bonus juices. Yeehaaa! What a good business man.  Now about his juices fuck they are good! Even the ones I dont like still taste good just not to my taste eg Grandpa Joes which a lot of people do like.

An ohms checker . Some drillbits ..mm. Nail clippers for cutting your wire. A pair of pointy nose pliers.optional Depending on how good your eyes are some  magnifying glasses from the chemist . And last but not least probably one of the easiest RBAs to start with would be a kayfun theyre easy to build on and have a decent size deck bit of a pain in the ass to get wicking right but once you do youll never look back.I think thatll be perfect little settup to get you started and should run u less then  bux Also remember that the MVP has a ohm limmit of .ohm so it wont fire lower coil than that so u may need a calculator the one I suggest www.steamengine.orgHope this helps D Have fun and Vape on,aussievapers,cl5qghg,8,t5_2xo3j

8993933,0,t1_d7swjd7,apparently theyll offer a new law against the restrictions... dont know exactly when but sure of that as hell. the model of uk might get started to being applied in australia. until then importing is the thing. oh and if i were you... i would buy a starter kit with a mod and tank and vape with that. way better with the flavour. you can buy the devices here in australia. ,aussievapers,d7sxjh3,1,t5_2xo3j

9551111,0,t1_d9p5555,Yeah if thats the case Id recommend sticking to something with a top air flow as that eliminates the overwhelming majority of leaking. If you want a kit with similar specs to the two they suggested but with top air flow have a look at the Joytech Cuboid Mini kit or a Joyetech eVic AIO. Ive never personally used one but a Kanger Cupti might be worth a look too. ,aussievapers,d9qddwd,1,t5_2xo3j

10544108,0,t1_dd3aheg,Oh and to answer your question about buying a new tank and if it will fit.  of tanks will fit on it as it has a  connection so when youre looking at tanks just make sure they mention a  connectionthread in the specifications.Only thing to check with the tanks is make sure they are in the right resistance range for your mod for the istick its ..ohm TC modes and ..ohm VWBypassSmart modeJuice usage is more dependant on the settings your mod is on so higher wattagepowder obviously it will use up the juice faster.,aussievapers,dd3aj7f,2,t5_2xo3j

11483686,0,t1_dfxmc0n,I could pretty much guarantee that itll follow the the BBC doco on vaping. Only just be shittier version. Theyve even got the same research guy from big tobacco that the BBC used. Thankfully this guy comes across as open and honest and generally on the side of vaping. Theyll play it up at the start like theyre leaning towards menace then hopefully come back to it being an overall positive for harm reduction. Normally Id rather punch myself in the knob than watch  minutes but Ill make an exception this time.. theyd better not screw it up!,aussievapers,dfxo9sm,2,t5_2xo3j

11762249,0,t3_64y6c1,best advice I can give as far as fasttech goes pay the . iirc for expedited delivery and only buy items that say theyre in stock. dont get batteries unless they say authentic and even then put them in a separate order if you really must and have then shipped by boat be prepared to wait a long time I once ordered a few things that said in stock  days meaning they were waiting on an order  days later I cancelled the order and converted it to credit in their store and just ordered other stuff I needed instead. ,aussievapers,dgta3qu,1,t5_2xo3j
