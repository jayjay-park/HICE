4476775,0,t3_3cbx5e,I want to start by saying I know exactly how you feel!! Uther is my most played hero and when I started playing him I did research on optimal builds.  I got REALLY overwhelmed with all the active talents... But trust me it gets easier. One by one these active talents become second nature. I will outline the order in which they clicked for me and why they are absolutely necessary to learn. PROTECTIVE SHIELD  this is so valuable and the easiest of the active talents to get good with. It is a talent used by many heroes so you might already have practice with it. Feel free to pop it any time someone is taking damage which is often and it will be part of your routine as a healer. You can then adapt optimal uses for it. SHRINK RAY  this is your best offensive contribution on team fights other than stun. It is nice to be able to chip in on offense a bit more... since Uther doesnt have much offensive input there isnt competition between shrink and other abilities. Just send it in any time an enemy melee is engaged. BENEDICTION  it took me a while for this one... And Im still working on it. I cant tell you how many games I picked this talent and then didnt even use it once. But.. Uthers biggest weakness is long cooldowns and this talent addresses just that. How many times have you been in a fight and there are multiple allies that need a big burst heal? This will solve that dilemma! The cooldown on benediction isnt even that long you need to get in the habit of hitting it BEFORE your first heal. Spend a few games where you really focus on getting as much as possible out of benediction and from then on you will never overlook it. It is such a valuable ability. CLEANSE  oh my. Undoubtedly both the hardest talent to use on this list and the most important at higher level play. Luckily most of us dont play at the highest levels so it is ok to skip cleanse for now. I would skip it until I am totally comfortable with all other abilities here. In order to effectively use cleanse you will usually have less than  seconds so it might not be mechanically possible unless you see the stun coming before it is in effect. It will take a lot of practice with the ability and also a lot of game experience before you have the awareness to be good with it.  I would recommend Clairvoyance instead. It is still an active ability but it is not as high pressure and time sensitive as Cleanse. You can kind of use it at your leisure and its application is very underrated. It will show cloaked players but also reveal any part of the map. It is great for checking if the enemy Is taking a camp or maybe the boss.  clairvoyance will give you a lowpressure ability to mix in with the others so you can get used to the number of active talents.Then when you think you are ready add in cleanse and keep your eyes open for times to use it... Because it is a game changer.,HoTSSupports,csuytus,3,t5_38z7d
4531096,0,t3_3crfjw,Hi one of the big mistakes that Tanks and supports make is that they try to take on an aggressive role.Tanks and supports are there to protect the assassins. So if you are playing Uther for example you dont need to run in melee and try to get to that Kael in the backline but maybe you can stun their melee assassin or even tank who is going aggressive onto you squishy backline.If you die as a support and you arent sure you should have check the replay. I sometimes see situations where i went to deep and died. You should NEVER be divine shielding or ancestral healing yourself.If you do you made a positioning mistake.,HoTSSupports,ct1s36z,2,t5_38z7d
