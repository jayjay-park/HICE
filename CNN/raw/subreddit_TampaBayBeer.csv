8662654,0,t3_4yk68j,Celiac here. Your friends best alternative is going to be ciders and meads.  They are usually gluten free. I have not yet seen a brewery in Tampa that does a gf beer but southern brewing company has some of the best cider Ive had. There are gf beers I havent seen a one made in Tampa. Lots of the places around will have cider and some will carry bottles of gf beer. ,TampaBayBeer,d6og6xc,2,t5_2y1ft
