6963818,0,t3_4ahik4,I like the idea especially considering it opens up options for offhand on the class.Might be worth offhanding a whip...it could potentially disarm on a landed strike.  Suddenly I want to offhand a hammer for the opportunity to smash a shield out of the way and land a main hand attack...etc.cool idea Im in favor ,xaos,d15onc0,2,t5_3846x
