Pepper your lane liberally with recon. There youre now better than every support player.I realise youre advocating a more active support role but people who play support typically take a bunch of rocket artillery and expensive planes and just waste a ton of points and supply and would help their team more by quitting.But more active support like holding one uncontested point and trying to fill gaps in the line elsewhere is also bad for a new player as it requires much more attention to do well than focusing on one lane.,wargame,cg4vh7p,3,t5_2tlh1

601147,0,t1_cg8kirl,I think they just scaled naval units up a bit too far. If theyd kept it to littoral craft and amphibious units they wouldnt need to scale jets and artillery up so far that it puts them out of balance with the other land units resulting in SAMs getting longer ranges etc. Eventually something is on the losing end of the power ramping.Currently artillery is overpowered to the extent it prevents infantry from holding towns which should be a valid and important part of static and defensive area denial strategy.If they get rid of the larger ships the entire reason for overpowering artillery and ASMs would go away and a better balance would return. It would also retain the important focus on the land combat with naval units playing a supporting role rather than jumping the shark to become a fullon peer to land units with water capture zones and all that. Shifting the focus away from land is where the problems arise and naval forces become too powerful necessitating the ramping of power in other units like howitzers.,wargame,cg8lqy8,3,t5_2tlh1

Spetz and Sapery  both have RPO in mechanized deck can easily handle a full deck of FJ mechairborne and in comparable availability while having access to more useful transports.  Artillery still kills them quite easily and with all the arty spam no infantry survives long unless you micro hard as do rocket pod helis. Napalm strikes and k bombs are also effective. Basically the same tactics you would use vs spetz back in ALB. What really makes FJ and all special forces infnatry so deadly is their ability to basically teleport between city blocks.

1127553,0,t3_27135i,As the name implies they are meant to destroy tanks. I love tank destroyers because they are expendable and they can grind an armored assault to a halt if were talking about ATGMsNow if youre referring to vehicles with heavy caliber cannons like the Bushmaster that are listed as tank destroyers  I suppose high availability and low cost can make deploying many of them a possibility and  of them shooting one tank can take it out no problem even though they have reduced range.I dont like hunting them Id rather set up a death trap near chokepoints. I prefer using Tank destroyers with ATGMs as the muscle to take out heavy and expensive tanks and using fire support vehicles tank destroyers with cannons to take out less valuable targets and infantry that could try to attack my ATGMs. Id also keep the tank destroyers deployed individually to avoid giving away the exact number and keeping them from getting all stunned from one shelling.Now if youre going to hunt down tanks use tank destroyers with cannons on them because the ones with ATGMs cannot fire on the move. Tank hunting has never really worked for me. ,wargame,chwgj55,1,t5_2tlh1

1559207,0,t1_cjbi9pn,You can literally get  ATGM units for less cost than one superheavy. Its not even hard to do. pt ATGM carriers or even infantry will outnumber the tank they are trying to kill. And if you are paying more for an ATGM unit you dont actually need  hits on its front armor. Hellfires and other highAP missiles will do the job with fewer hits and have even longer range. Not to mention you can get ATGMs including Hellfires on helicopters. Or perhaps you were lazy and didnt feel like buying your tank counters in advance. Why not get a SALH missile plane instead? Tanks have a plethora of counters which are highly effective and far more pointsefficient than the actual tanks. Tank counters will routinely outperform actual tanks in costefficiency against most other types of targets. Why get a  point tank when a  point ATGM has more range and punishes you less if it dies? It only has to kill  points to pay for itself.What we should be seeing is a dependence on the versatility of main battle tanks at engaging a wide variety of land vehicles with ATGMs used to gain an advantage against enemy tanks as an auxiliary aspect of the battle. Instead what we actually see in Wargame prebugged missiles is almost no tanks but lots of ATGMs. ATGMs used against everything from trucks all the way up to superheavies. They should be too expensive for that.Cannons are very inferior weapons due to their reduced range and KE property. ATGMs have far superior range and deal their full AP value. Thus cannons should cost fewer points to deploy than ATGMs. This will encourage deployment of cannons against most types of targets like trucks IFVs and so on. Armor is more effective against lowerAP weapons like cannons. Thus tanks would behave more like armor if players relied more on cannons due to lower cost. And this gives ATGMs their purpose defeating heavy armor at a distance. Not killing everything with an engine in a .km radius.,wargame,cjbpxfh,1,t5_2tlh1

Mortars are very nice but howitzers do have some advantages when it comes to range and damage.Pretty much every time Ive used a deck with no arty Ive regretted it a lot. There are few things in wargame as frustrating as being hit by artillery without being able to strike back. The caesar paladin AS and both MSTAs all have s aim time and are very accurate which makes them very useful for counter artillery or quickly removing a CV or AA unit. For me these are pretty much mandatory if available.If those arent available I tend to bring a card of mm howitzers or similar to fill this role. Not nearly as good as the above but I still find them useful enough. CVs and AA dont tend to move a lot so the s aimtime isnt that bad.And ofc any time I play as Sweden or Scandinavia Ill bring  cards of BKan and  FOBs.  of these will enable you to pretty much remove any soft target in a fairly large area.,wargame,cjgbw7g,0,t5_2tlh1

Certainly not for NSWP which has pretty decent infantry choices.That being said I changed ATGM infantry transport to the point Chechz autocannon.

With units launching ITOWs and Hellfires they dont really need one plus they get ATGM RECON the first and only in the game.I have to disagree with this one. ITOWs TOWs and TOWs are fired from vehicles that tend to be pristean targets for heavy artillery and mortars. Even if you move them and the enemy recon spots them its pretty easy to tell where they are going to position them.Hellfires come from gunships which in this game are very hard to use due to the effectiveness and the amount of AA in the game. In order to use those choppers you got to neutralise all AA in the area just to take a couple pawnshots before the enemy tanks retreat.A Man ATGM would give America a  highly mobile and easy conceivable unit that enemy recon wouldnt be able to spot immediately and morters wouldnt be able to effect it if placed in buildings.I see no reason why America cannot have a good ATGM other then Eugen doesnt want to put it in.,wargame,ck3b64h,3,t5_2tlh1

Shit accuracy  low damage  short range  low ammo counts usually either the planes chase around a bit until my interceptor wanders over an AA unit and dies or it may damage the enemy and he flies away. I wouldnt mind it so much if airtoair wasnt so goddamn vulnerable to everything on the ground. In REAL LIFE you wouldnt shoot antiaircraft missiles at two aircraft engaging in ACM because you cant guarantee that your missile will hit the proper target.

2384378,0,t3_2mpg9p,I feel like this arrangement would be rather unbalanced. A rapid fire long range missile launcher even with  percent accuracy would murder air units. The reduction to  HE doesnt matter all that much either With heavy SAMs all having  HE they still need  hits to kill a target. This would also require  hits to kill meaning that in most scenarios this would be as deadly as a Patriot. Also giving this more range than a patriot makes little sense to me. Yes the AMRAAMs currently modeled in game have a range of m but you have to remember that they are getting launched from a plane that is traveling ms giving them more initial velocity than a ground launched missile. Plus the ground launched missile would need to travel through the lower atmosphere meaning thicker air. This also cuts the range of the missile from the airborne version. My prediction is that this is a TOR counterpart. m or thereabouts in range  accuracy and an HE of anywhere from  to . NATO doesnt really have a TOR counterpart and this would fill that gap. That being said Eugen does what they want.... But this is how I would make the NASAMRAAM. ,wargame,cm6f1bl,2,t5_2tlh1

Ditch either of them for a card of Falls  and the other for a card of Rima in Panthers. You need some heli borne infantry.You have too much arty.

You might also consider getting some BGS instead of the fuchs as theyre better for sneaking and hiding.

Great example the back doors on some I dont know about all BMPs are fuel tanks thus making them look pretty thick. When we saw this the U.S. military and intellegence community flipped its collective shit because we thought this thing had a hugely armored troop companyment that would make the guys inside basically untouchable by anything besides a tank main gun or a TOW missile. We thought wed need to completely reasses the way we fought APCs. Turns out that this was entirely unfounded because the doors are full of fuel and make it pretty easy to spectacularly BBQ the poor guys inside. I agree with you the hind is a beast for sure but consider what youre saying resistant to does not mean untouchable it means that the moment somebody catches them with a burst from an M theyre not going down.

Or for  points you can get a BTRZD Skrezet and provide excellent antiinfantry and antihelo backup to your VDV team.I like the combat transports because you end up with increased overall combat effectiveness.  Much more cost effective than just cheaply bringing out more infantry.  You can give your Spetz teams an antivehicle transport to make up for their weakness and give your VDV antiinfantry ability.  You can then provide nondirect combat teams like Igla or Konkurs with complimentary units.  e.g. if Im bringing in Konkurs sometimes it might be nice to have their transport serve an ATGM role also.  Double the effectiveness for only a few more points.  Or maybe give them a BTRD which is only  points but gives them very good defense against enemy infantry so they arent defenseless.

Fair point with the ma can be amazing but very limited indeedYou could drop the kiowa for a longbow but that falls under the same category as ma issues. Still how is a bradley recon useless though? compared to a itow  carier. It has medium stealth so it can hide better pretty much undetected and gets focused fired less often by the unit ai they have  missiles do you really need more? and  armor helps a lot.

Then there is points economy and availability consideration for bringing in reinforcements.   EDIT Last two cents  Since you built a mechanized deck your foremost consideration is spamming infantry into places like no tomorrow.  So when considering the various APCs or IFVs and pricing there are two question I ask myself.   Is this APC or IFV a good standalone fire support platform?  and  Is the price right for my required spamming.  So when looking at W. Germany IFV options.  I approve of Marder  Marder  and A and M.  APCs are perfect for emergency reinforcements because its cheap and you can get the infantry you want.Thats the key you picked mechanized for the infantry not the IFV.

The simple fix of being able to see unit paths and fire arcs would greatly reduce the nitpicky micro involved in placing your units and the nonsense with using FIRE POS to determine line of firerange. I dont think that set troop formations like in TW would be beneficial in most cases due to terrain but being able to group units together and have them move the same speed would be helpful and solve most of the issues with advancing units.I dont think Radar or Planes really need a major fix although I wish there was a hotkey for radar weapons off not just turn off weapons.

3637173,0,t1_cq6tx0n,Theyd hardly be out of business  theyre not a particularly large studio and with a fraction of the success theyve had Im sure they could keep creaking on. Therere plenty of more mediocre games and studios under Focus that have after all.Concerning maps you can blame shitty players in the community for that  without the whole cheating debacle and the need to spend ages working on anticheat software at the tail end of last year theyd probably have been finished off before they had to turn their staff over to AoA development. As it stands they couldve said that therell be no new maps but to my knowledge havent  what has been said is that there cant be any timeframe given when another game is in full development and any Wargame work will have to be parttime at best.The balance? Five wargame fans walk into a bar none agree on the balance. I dont disagree that it could use work but I for one dont have confidence in my ability to change it without incurring the ire of some other group of players. Its not an easy job. And theyve noted that US infantry arent debuffed but are purposely weaker because in their eyes they need to compensate for the US being stronger elsewhere. Insofar as its not a mistake or negligence and rather a decision taken by the devs concerning what they want their game to look like if you dont like it you ought to go give them a negative review somewhere.Bluntly though  Japanese infantry have a similar problem ingame being pretty pathetic in performance terms and many people have made valid arguments like how the GSDF received PzF s before the ROK Army did or how there were plenty of other ITT assets that the SDF could use to call for buffs. I personally feel that the Japanese in game could be stronger  but I also feel that not everybody would agree with me on that count or the specifics of how that would be done and I certainly dont feel that it discounts the very good work and community engagement Ive seen from Eugen in developing this series. As for DLCs everybody seems to have their own line of reasoning why Eugen releasing free and comprehensive DLCs for each of their Wargame entries isnt a good thing and is somehow an attempt by the dev to cash in or otherwise exploit their fanbase. They couldve released less comprehensive DLCs they didnt have to update the NSWP or Scandi nations they didnt have to run Unit of the Day threads. They couldve pulled an EA and offered paid DLC as powerups to players with hefty bank accounts. They didnt even need to balance the game if they didnt want to bluntly  if all they wanted was to make money and promote the game they couldve slapped together two or three maps into DLC packs and released a few of those at intervals. Honestly? The games not perfect. But I think the devs a lot better than most out there and people have been giving them relentless shit for it.,wargame,cq6v5gf,5,t5_2tlh1

You make a really good point about the Gorno being comparable with LR for AoD. I find them really map specific as you said but the margin between what the VDV can do in cityforestcentric map versus what the Gorno can do seems really thin to me. So I feel I might as well bring a KonkursM even in dense maps to place them in those few angles and positions they may be useful. Ill check out the howitzer as you suggested I have never played them before. The Nona I like for the long range and reasonably fast ROF. They are weak though even against AA so I miss having something with bigger ooomph so that I dont always have to rely on my air assets to counter AA. For the Tanks I took your suggestion for the lineup T low end then Tb with TBV and TBU. The UM doesnt fit my play style. What do you recommend for forest fighting is there anything similar to the ONTOS? What about the Norov? Ill check out the PD Ive played the PU but not the PD.

3947213,0,t3_35mizr,The answer is yes.  However the biggest thing going for a flank is proper timing and maintaining element of surprise.Ive done this roughly over a dozen times on vs and vs although not full force flank on v mostly on Floods with general decks with very specific motorized units in each tab.  This is done for two reasons A Necessary speed required and B Fallback option to play w heavy units if flank fails.  Usually Ill pull  of my force for a flank if the map allows it.Tracked heavies usually take too long to maintain element of surprise so having motorized composition of tanks infantry AA recon is immensely helpful.  Supply is also necessary for keeping Fuel and Ammo up. You also need to bring in a CV for the countercap if you flank to shutdown reinforcements during the strike with possible gaining full control. As long as the enemy doesnt know how full composition of force pulled to the flank if revealed is another key to success.A lot of people do hit and run flanks but I have bigger objectives to fry which is to be in your base killing all your dudes and taking over your spawn point.  Plus its extremely rare and more satisfying to see a full on combined arms ninja assault which I specialized in performing.  The more you can sneak pass unobserved the better.  But remember timing you cant build up a flank all day hence a big mass of motorized tanksvehicles w cheap Cobra spam is the fastest way to devastate somebodys day.  Ive successfully established a full flank force  of the time but assault disruption happens like  of the time and a complete success with eliminating enemy CV and establish my own CV in their spawn has only happened twice so maybe  chance of success.  When the assault happens its just down to timing and pure luck at that point.So the lessons takeaway from personal experience is  a Its relatively easy to make a full flank force positioned for attack. As long as you eliminate enemy recon from seeing your entire force enroute to staging area as well as keeping the staging area reconfree. b Incredibly hard to maintain element of surprise and thus get disrupted by the enemy before the planned assault goes off on their spawn sector. c Easy to jump the gun while observing all the juicy enemy targets you could kill with your recon placed looking at them.  Proper timing and patience will pay off if you give your units time to prep for the attack in the forward position. d Have an alternative objective of pissing the enemy off with lots of guys in the forest if your planned assault fails and only give token reinforcements until you establish a new backup line associated with the main forces flank. e Use a generalized deck with motorized elements that has heavier unit elements to quickly switch gears between strategies of full force flank maneuver to supporting main force maneuver on main forces flank.And if I fail which does happen a lot.  However failure to capture the spawn is not complete failure it also diverts a lot of the enemy resources from ejecting my force from the forest instead of fighting the main force which buys valuable time. I do the falling back retreat to make the enemy pay for every inch of regaining ground while rushing up heavier units I have placed in my deck for the more traditional fighting style on a determined secondary line so Im not completely useless either for the rest of the match.  ,wargame,cr67t2u,2,t5_2tlh1
3948560,0,t1_cr68i6l,Kappa is correct in his opinion.  While the forest does not have water there are areas with rivers in the enroute to said forests which require ampib vehicles to cross undetected. And as said before bridges are obvious chokepoints to observe with recon with thus eliminating element of surprise.  Maintaining element of surprise is a huge force multiplier when performing flanking maneuvers.Although not everything needs to be amphibious to have successful flank its just more helpful in the criteria list.,wargame,cr6dbuc,1,t5_2tlh1

4272908,0,t1_cs79ocr,Well Id start with the free demos because theyre free.  The Black Sea demo has a couple of training missions and one very difficult companysized mission that will keep you playing for quite a while on its own.  All the games after Shock Force are using the newer graphics engine Id avoid all the ones before it because theyre way outdated.  You can get Shock Force on ebay for like  it features a hypothetical modern engagement between USA and SyriaInsurgents.  I find the SP extremely difficult.  You have to really think and take things slow to win some of these missions.  The difficulty setting doesnt actually change the AI difficulty or give it any extra units it changes how communication works and how long things like artillery support takes to call in.  At the highest difficulty you have to worry about keeping units close enough together to communicate with each other or hope they have working radios and if one unit sees an enemy but is outside of comm range the other units will not be able to directly target said enemy.  Id highly recommend setting the difficulty to basic training on your first tries because its still pretty damn hard. There is no MP servers.  You have to find someone to play with on the forums.  However the game offers two game modes  Real time default and turnbased old CM style.  In turnbased mode they actually offer play by email where you can email each other your turns.  Im not sure if there is a Coop but there might be.  But there is a huge online repository full of usermade missions and campaigns to download and the game is moddable so there are lots of skins and sound mods to download too.,wargame,cs79vtz,7,t5_2tlh1
4282671,0,t1_cs78nfg,Considering how much smaller Eugen is compared to those ESPORT RTS publishers are even being associated with that other company that released that other game at the same time may not be a bad thing. Looking at the AOA engine gives me hope that Eugen now have a new engine that allows for more detailed modeling of closerange engagements. So instead of the INF jumping and warping around building blocks in WG today maybe we will see more accurate behavior around buildings structures forests in a future WG? Reuse of IP assets is a real thing just like Porsche making that ugly SUV so that they could justify designing the engine that then went to other real Porsche cars. Without such improvement to the game engine whats the path for a future WG game? Slightly different settings different maps? We can argue that Eugen should have invested in improving the WGRD maps but maybe a significant improvement is not within sight thanks to the IP developed for AOA.

Id honestly rather have  MAs and  HCs than  TBUs and  TUMs. ATGMs are totally unnecessary  of the time. Against good players ATACMS gt SMERCH Patriot is fucking insanely good in the hands of someone who knows how to micro their Radar AA. Longbow is the best gunship in the game by far. DAP is waaaaaay better than MiV Nighthawk amp FD Eagle gt SUM amp IL Raven is the only Good stealth SEAD in the game and US selection of SEAD is just much better overall. Stinger C gt IglaNWhat makes NORAD stronger than SOVIETKOREA in my experience Given only a slight numbers advantage acquired through the use of other advantages listed above Canadian Airborne   stacks of Assault Engineers will run over Spetsnaz. This is how I win games on Wonson harbour against SovietKorea too many people overlook the fact that the M Flash is the highest DPS napalm launcher in the game at urban combat ranges. PatriotStinger Cs laugh at BMIG whores. I find it weird how most people cheap out on AA considering how many players love to use bombers Ive never regretted buying a Patriot or Stinger Cs. The MEXAS is total monster I am not afraid to fight the more expensive TB with a MEXAS. Canadian Rifles  in the TH. This is the absolute nail in the coffin for any debate on whether to play NORAD or US. This combination is so much better than Riflemen  in MAs.

4666522,0,t1_cti6g4q,I see major issues in your blufor one. Scandi is okay if perhaps not quite to my taste.Logi Consider an additional command unit or replacing a jeep with something armoured. Not essential though due to lack of points.Inf Jagers smaw and rifles arent worth it replace with good inf. I strongly recommend USA marines  in lvtps dem frags and fusiliers  in warrior milans. Also use  inf where possible youre giving yourself a poor hand by using lower quality units in a post  deck. AA inf are missing too use the swedish m ones something I generally use in every deck. If you prefer bradleys use the  version of inf.Support Avenger and chapparels are solid good choices. Generally good all round.Tanks The leopards are okay but perhaps replace the a with the MIP which is  points more for a very slightly worse gun but  pts of armour instead of  on the front.Recon Highly subjective category. You have all types of recon covered so well done there.Vehicle Just why? There are so much better units out there. The TOW hummer or the bradley are great ones for tank killing use one of them instead. Helo Okay choices people may disagree but its subjective as always.Air Id recommend replacing the wild weasel with the prowler or the raven. Thing is youre paying extra for that multirole nature if thats your intent fair enough but imo SEAD shouldnt need to fight other planes. Block  is solid. The kahu is a poor choice imo. Most significantly compare and contrast the avb harrier II which may be better for you multirole and cheaper. Or better yet use the hornet which is damn good.The biggest problem with your blufor deck is a general lack of high end units especially for the inf which is using substandard units. You really want to be looking for the best of the best if youre going full blufor so cherrypick out the best units you can get.On reflection while using the armoury to browse through I can really see why a general blufor is bad.

4840143,0,t1_cu4mgvo,It wouldnt be pure light infantry but the pricing and avaliability would make them more of a focus than with other nations. Fast but lightly armed infantry in light transports could work with limited tanks to attempt to penetrate the enemy line at several points if a weak spot is found they can spread out hitting supply lines and command units behind the frontline. The cheapness and sheer number of units means that you can afford to have a lot of men on the field probing.I imagine  infantry in  transports being the light infantry with high foot speed but only light arms. They could be backed up by heavier more traditional infantry in older soviet transports. Tanks would be mainly older soviet stuff with vehicles like cheap  technicals light trucks with a weapon on the back carryign recoiless rifles AA guns mortars and ATGMs. Artillery is primarily lighter guns and unarmoured mortar vehicles doing hit and run attacks. A handful of up gunned utility choppers could provide air support as well as cheap soviet aircraft.Sure heavy weapons would take their toll but the cheapness of the units means this can be taken you can overwhelm the enemies defenses with rapid attacks from multiple angles your infantry can infiltrate at long range to hit supply lines and rear area units. This nation counters a lot of tactics based on precision weapons a  jet with  missiles can only really knock out  worth of your units. The nation can also be used to complement teammates heavy shock troops break a hole in the line and instantly dozens of cheap units a flowing through and cutting off roads and bridges everywhere.

I do not like to making the deck in a way it does not suit me or which seems to me super unreal  like having units from Poland and North Korea in same decks. But I know that my decks and playstyle is not competitive and not only because of thismainly the lack of skill  i know that I do respect people who hunts perfection. It is just other way to have fun than I like. In my eyes neither one is worse or better.But despite that everything even I want to learn the game mechanics better not to be such a deadweight to my probably competitive teammates when I play MP. Thus I would like to ask... I have cmnd helis in some of my decks with intention to use it to quick caping some sectors and wait there only a short time until my teammates get it with slower but more reasonable cmnd unit on at least on and bigger maps. The idea never used it yet never had guts to propose it to teammates is especialy for conquest to get early points for a small but maby important advantage over classic way... Or to get to very far sectors wait there a minute or two and get out again conquest maps only  it could have some advantages in other games to get small early deploy point boost at start. The idea is I get only cmnd helis at start and provide this way of support for team then leave caping and holding for others leaving the heli i spawned with on a safe place border forest further behind my spawn lets say and use it only to cap a sector where we lost cv and yet is safe to cap e.g. enemy got lucky with arty or when it is safe to neutralise enemy cv defensive line considerably far from border of zone.The rest of the decks would be built more or less on a standard basis.Thus with this idea in my head which may be unworthy I was quite furious to not know why is it such a bad idea. I get it is not good for small games onon but I guess it could have its place in some bigger games. Am I completely wrong? Is it too risky? Naturely st condition to use that deck would be agreement with my team over it. Yes  units per card is overshot but it is compensation for the vulnerability of the unit.And secondly should I really have  command infantry in every deck? As have them in some to go with roleplay of deck yes I do that but I prefer cheap cmnd APCs over them who are my only command units in most of my decks... And I never heard a complain from team I dont have many games under my belt though. In same way I excluded airplanes from some of my decks am not good with them and usualy team complains about me loosing them points for enemy while being OK with me not having them... that is my deck building strategy often I am unable to properly use ATGMs so I limited their numbers in my deck I found even here it is being said it is better for a RD novice EEsolo was my playground before that to not rely on airplanes until mastering the ground forces... And definitely my decks are more managable for me suddenly also extra points are usualy welcomed though sometimes I miss them when my allies gain the air superiority to be specific.,wargame,cuijnjx,1,t5_2tlh1

The modern concept is that brigades receive attachments before deploying thereby becoming a brigade sized task force.Historically I think Wargame is closest to what we used to call an Armored Cavalry Regiment which were capable of independent operations complete with their own organic aviation assets designed to cover or guard ahead of a division element.But to get back to the point what I like about Wargame are the discussions I have with my teammates about where to mass combat power which in many ways parallel the discussions going on during a brigade sized movement to contact.,wargame,cuwsx90,2,t5_2tlh1

My favorite Scandi SF is Kustjgare  although FSK comes in a much much better transport XANO Get your IFV fix with the excellent PvGrp RBS . This combo wrecks tanks infantry and even shoos off helicopters its an excellent support for your infantry. If you want more delicious CV variants put your Stormers in them. You dont have a MANPAD team which arent absolutely necessary but I like them to secure my towns from helos. Put the Gevaermen in a XAvariant the speed and armor make it worth the extra pts.SUP  Options is indeed a bit much. Go for  SPAAG  long range antiplane missile and  fast IR AA.

5210003,0,t3_3m877b,Yes. There is a role. That role is in the type of economic trickle the game parameters provide. In low income games line infantry is essential. Only line infantry is always essential just not necessarily as a line or in a line in the front line of an assault. Line infantry should be more clearly considered rear infantry or foot security a unit that moves in when all the more expensive units the more deadly and long range units have already cleared the area.Conscripts for example provide urban defense and area denial or if deep forest exists it can tie up enemy units long enough for CAS to arrive. The infantry is the line essentially as it is the most static unit in the game in terms of relative speed. Thus it seems that it is therefore more a line before scrimmage where the combat must take place in the nomansland that the Infantry man in position must perceived as the terrain in front of its collective facing. . ,wargame,cvdzxv8,1,t5_2tlh1
5217165,0,t1_cveultc,Thats an unnecessary rude response. But to not lower myself to your level I will give a normal answer. Show me how many top post you have as answers to questions on the subreddit. It depends on the length of the a volley and whit what unit you counter battery. I will assume they will be a  hp squad. A city allows very fast small movement but has minimum time they need to be in  block before the can move again. The counter battery could aim of the block next to them and hit them if they start aiming at beginning of inf mortars fire. This will make them very micro intensive since fire swift move wont work. They will also have a limited range probably around km based on the aml mm mortar vehicle. This will force them to fire from a forest or hedgerows on many maps. Calculating circle of movement after firing is very easy for experienced players.gt You ever played this game before or is thinking just not your thing?I have played this game a lot with an infantry focused playstyle. I know how easy it is to kill atgm teams even with their power to teleport which will be spotted during the jump. But of you want to micro a bunch of  weak  he mortars with low ammo and a  pts price tag be my guest. I can see some use as a smoke machine but might aswel use a mortar vehicle in that case with more ammo and it not using a very important infantry slot. ,wargame,cveuzyh,5,t5_2tlh1

5621141,0,t3_3s2sdm,Was bored Reconnaissance Strike Group One is Scandinavian one is American. Unfortunately since the M AGS NASAMs Apache Longbow and AMOS are prototyped they cant all be put into the same deck. So neither is perfect and neither is what youd call competitive.Specifically the Scandi deck is missing ATGMs on the STRF  and the other IFV the Stormers come in. The Puma IFV would have a topattack ATGM SpikeLR much like the Javelin but with extended range. It does have the AMOS and NASAMs and I cheated a little on the Support by adding the LVKV to simulate Pumas engaging helis with their autocannon IRL it is very effective. There is no M AGS so I went with the Leopard NO series tanks they shoot rapidly but are relatively lowarmored. I think its a fair move. On the air tab I went with American knockoff systems.In the US version I went with the M variants the obvious issue here is that the Puma is supposed to be an upgrade of the Bradley. The Bradley has TOWs however which make it a better approximation than the Scandi IFVs. You get the Apaches MLRS and Patriot approximation of NASAMs from the Strike BN. The Air Tab is expensive which I think is a fair representation of the Air Force generally.,wargame,cwtuu9s,0,t5_2tlh1

But honestly you just need to get to lvl  and you can have enough stars for any campaign.Completing campaign missions will net you stars too.Good thing is that you can reset your stars after each campaign so that way you can unlock all the units for that campaign.Also the cool and challenging thing about EE campaign is that unit losses and promotions carry onto the next mission of that campaign. So it teaches you to be careful with your good units.Overall the campaigns are actual real campaigns. Unlike ALB and EE campaigns that are just dynamic campaigns that Honestly are nothing more then just skirmish mode but with limitations on what units you have.,wargame,cxfl2z7,1,t5_2tlh1

Yeah definitely just because you heard Faust shadowboxed his way to the top totally means he shadowboxed his way to the top. Thanks for the insight! You should probably v Faust and expose him for the skilless shadowboxer he really is. Do you know the real problem with Wargame?

5951262,0,t3_3wwja0,The AI doesnt avoid your units though. Not unless youve driven them back and are chasing their CVs. Ive played the campaigns quite extensively and yes the difficulty is artificial but thats the case for most RTS AIs.You can and should set up ambushes one tactic which works really well is if you are able to surround the oncoming AI which will pretty much always drive on roads in the direction of your sector until they make contact.In any case this is what Ive learned from spamming the campaigns and I do enjoy them although I understand your frustration but for a reason Ill get to laterThe AI pretty much has a fairly simple set of priorities it will follow in this order. Secure extra sectors on the map most of all the reinforcement sectors to avoid getting CV sniped I presume which is actually pretty easy to do agains the AI they dont often leave many defenses. Attack the players sectors head on with a priority on the reinforcing sectors obviously. If the player gets to close to their last CV run to try and avoid a total defeat or retreat the forces to avoid their total destruction.You can exploit pretty much each of these behavioral patterns.The easiest of which is of course number .Now the one annoying thing is that even in a diverse army the AI will select what it thinks are the best units and spam the shit out of them. If it has arty it will get  pieces out at the least planes will never come alone either. So then for the assaulting forces this seems to be the priorityHelis gt Tanks gt InfantryIt will spam those units in that order most of the time. Infantry is always last though unless its heliborne infantry in which case they will go along with the heli rush.So then its down to knowing what to expect and setting up your defense accordingly. I think its quite rewarding and fun you always have to try and use your units to maximum efficiency and its a great way to learn what kills what well under which circumstances.My biggest gripe is how hard a single loss can be punished on the strategic map. Because of your units routing and getting overrun the next round or losing a battalionregiment you absolutely need to keep. Although this last one can be easily avoided just never use the last units of a give type so you always have something to send back and get reinforced.,wargame,cxzqnyi,5,t5_2tlh1
5951481,0,t1_cxzpio5,Eugen just doesnt have the size and engine to do this. From what heared the engine is pretty complicated and the map making proces is also difficult using  different systems that all need be documented and made usable before user made maps would be a thing. And that proces is to expensive for Eugen to do right now. They have said that they are looking into a map editor after they make the modding tools for Act of Aggression. So it is just very hard to do for Eugen since the game wasnt built up with modding in mind.An another important argument is that modding will split up the already small community in even smaller groups. ,wargame,cxzrp6y,6,t5_2tlh1

It also doesnt take much damage from autocannons at long range making it a nice bmp or btr killer. The only issue here are atgms like the bmp  although this is sort of  preventable by being careful and having cev or abrams to scout ahead for atgms.  armor is a nice balanced value because that makes it  pts cheaper then a  armor tank with that gun would be that is resistant agiant autocannons rocket pods and medium tank guns. ,wargame,cypvkz2,2,t5_2tlh1

My Scandi support tab is EOTS  Otomatic  NASAMS  LVKVRover RBS depends how spicy Im feeling  AMOS.Youve got the EOTS Hawk for a big ol fuck you SEAD button when those Sus come rolling overhead. Fantastic defensive AA piece.Otomatics are of course the best gun AA in the game. They only have two weaknesses  Kas and a lack of stabilizers. Theyre still the absolutely perfect way to kill a helo rush.NASAMS are amazing generalpurpose AA pieces honestly. Yeah they eat supply but Scandi actually has pretty good supply options I mean theyre not HEMTTs but... so its not a real big deal. Its not so much that theyre fast its that theyre a guaranteed kill against most planes by sheer brute force of numbers.I usually run LVKV as my fourth because its a really good gun AA in its own right that also has a good stabilizer which the Otomagic just doesnt and its a lot cheaper. Alternatively RBS jeeps are cheap spammable fast and effective and cant be SEADed obviously the downside is that theyre not real IR AA theyre just glorified MANPADS.And then AMOS is the best mortar in the game without any doubt whatsoever.

It has one of the best midrange tanks in the game mexas with a good recon tab. Id say Eurocorps primary advantage over Commonwealth is AA. Commonwealths air tab is very good and it has many supporting tools making it very useful in vs and up  but I still have success in v. There are very few infantry units that deal with both armour and infantry costeffectively the way Ghurkas do the Rapier FSA is not that bad now and has a lot of missles to boot. Commonwealth also has a very good groundbased atgm game thanks to stormers adats aslav tow ferrets ect.

The AHA you compared to a TOW carrier this really isnt the case. Yes you do have to maintain visual on the target while the missile is in flight but with the SALH tag as opposed to the GUIDSACLOS tag the missile is considerably faster than the TOW. Im not trying to scold you and I really appreciate the discussion but the question Im working toward is yes the AHA is worse than the AHD but is it still good enough to warrant a card in a general deck?I have another question about the Longbow specifically. What phase of the game do you suggest buying one? Ive noticed that its pretty common for players to start the game with a super heavy tank is it wise to bring a Longbow at the beginning of a game to counter that?,wargame,d0ylbcs,1,t5_2tlh1

I think the variety of units in the game is one of its strongest features however having a lot of obsolete units that are not used or are OP and used only because of that doesnt help balance. The fact that it was also make army compositions more realistic is a bonus. If the game was focused around the actual regular forces used at the time there would still be a wealth of units but it would be easier to make the game more refined and balanced. And with regards to the realism argument this game compared to other RTS is supposed to be relatively realistic. There are compromises for gameplay obviously but the focus of this game is on somewhat realistic cold war battles rather than competitive small scale play.,wargame,d268bod,-1,t5_2tlh1

So are you saying bring more  point Yucks instead of Li Jian? With their cheapo transport thats only  points more than what Im getting the Li Jians for so I guess I could see it.I do not like RDs heli options. The Hip without a gun is just...I mean I know its a tanky rocket transport but they just feel so underwhelming.  points for  squad of Yuck s  Mi just feels really heavy for what you get and all Id want is a HindD.Oh and good call on the Chinese reservists. I totally missed that they had an actual gun and not a battle rifle. Will definitely pick up a card of those.gtSUPGood point on the HQA. I always go back and forth but if Im dropping the ASF Ill definitely want the better accuracy.gtTNKTotally agree here. Will switch out the boat tank for another card of ZTZ II I have the command points they need to go somewhere.gtRECSadly ZTQG is a proto unit and you only get  card. Ive been seeing a lot of the cheap tank recon in the meta and I think what makes the T recon work is the  front armor for  pointsbasically the idea is that you will see what kills it and thats kind of the point. China does get a nonproto ZTQI with good optics for  points but if the point is to have cheap recon something like the point Type  seems more valuable there. Still if Im going to fill out the tab might as well take Type s and ZTQ Is to fill it out.gtVEHLosing PTZ is going to be hard.  roundsmin at  AP is really really juicy. But then I think about it and with its piddly armor it really is just like an ATGM carrier with shorter range and higher ROF. And like you said the WZ is there.gtPLNI love my smartbombs. I just...hnng. I might try out the JH just for a switchup though. And I totally forgot about the Frogfoot. Its somehow actually more costefficient than the JH.

As such it could be theorized that the purpose of the mmarmed helos in Wargame would be to outrange and knock out unescorted transport helos bearing smaller armaments with the sole exception of the WT Sokol POL thats every transport helo in the game.,wargame,d5qh9q3,1,t5_2tlh1

8416262,0,t3_4uws8u,I think you are actually slow by a lot on this campaign heres some tricks I did. did not call in the Japanese naval unit sent the Korean fleet west on turn  offloaded the Tomcats to Daejong.. Instead called in the F squadron to turn assigned them to the tank unit in Sokcho. Set up your tanks in the to Chunchung sector with the phantoms on counterbattery duty to kill Tokchon s. In the Sokcho battle was able to kill all  attacking units by running them out of units. Turn  Seoul Defense was handled by cheesing with naval spawns. Start with every ship deployed and immediately rush the Nork spawn sector. I parked the Donghae LCU and  STRB over the ground spawn so every Nork vehicle that got called in was immediately stunned by the OTO Melara and killed by hellfire. The other STRB was parked over the bridge out of the spawn sector to catch stragglers. A command infantry was driven over water to neutralize the Nork spawn and the CV was killed by Haebyung . The remaining nork units were hunted down with mortars and STRB after the LCU was refueled via a FOB. Total victory with no retreat routes all attacking units destroyed. The Nork air was not a threat due to the fact that the Dong Hae was parked over the spawn and aircraft would immediately evac once fired upon by ground. Turn  you should have around  points to use. The key units are both helicopter units the  point SPAAG antiair and one infantry regiment. The Helicopters are rushed up ASAP the AA deployed to Busan and rushed to sokcho. The infantry regiment is sent to chungchung. The Japanese naval unit is used to block the Nork heli invasion. If you have points to spare call out the Dragonflys. When the dreaded Ts show up use your  helicopter regiments to alamo them hold spawn sectors with infantry and snipe the CVs with either the TOW MD or bombers. Seoul round  should play out pretty much the same. You should have a spare helicopter unit move them over the ocean sector into Seoul to prevent the Nork Marine retreat so they cant come back for round . Beat the Chinese fleet with the Japanese fleet also routing the helicopters at the same time. Call in the Foch ASAP and have it rest a turn. Call in the Japanese paratroopers ASAP drop the logistics company into a province the norks attacked from counter attack the nork units since the origin province is contested they all die on total victory. Once your province is clear retreat the paratroopers to safety. Alamo as many attacks as you can with helicopters. By turn  there were no Nork units left south of the Border the Foch is at  org the Ark is just called in and the Japanese fleet should be next to the Yellow sea sector. Next turn send them all into Qingdao and win the naval battle call out the Rima and royal marines paradrop a Japanese logistics convoy to get an additional start sector call in air from the Tomcats in Daejong. Instead of winning on points push into the chinese zones supported by the Harrier squadron and cap all  points to total victory destroying the Chinese units in the process. Embark the Japanese Paratroopers in Seoul. Your ground units should be next to pyongyong. Alamo Pyongyong with helicopters win take Chongjin with the SeahawksJapanese Paras.,wargame,d5tkqyg,1,t5_2tlh1

8692262,0,t3_4z1wzg,Generally an omni deck is what you need. Each major patch that has a redesign brings in a new flavor of the X. Right now SovietSKA armored is stupidly powerful. Before Red Dragon moto was a very popular choice. Some teams might have a heavy open using an NSWP mech deck or play a specific laneside of a map with a scandi or multi moto deck. You dont need to worry about stuff like that for at least  games. For you a specialty would be having say an extra card of heavier tanks in a soviet or US deck or maybe  cards of plane or an extra card or two of helos and recon inf in helo or perhaps you might use unicorn arty like the atacm or smerch. Perhaps you carry a lot of infantry atgm or IFV like having a card of bradley tow in infantry and recon bradley in recce or for soviet having konkursm AND bmp or gorno. None of those require a specialized deck but you can definitely make up for something that someone else is lacking.       Arty  Depends on the players. v will see mortars and airstrikes. vs will start to see heavier mortars and FCS s. Maybe buratino or smerch MLRS. vv can see mm and each player can get up ish points of arty if they want to. Groups of low end arty. A soviet heavy team on VOIP can keep rockets out going early and often in pairs firing and refiring half salvos for maximum effectiveness.    Strike packages are a thing when you have cordinated teammates. Seeing x sead bombers or atgm maybe even napalm and ASF going around the side right to left or vice versa.

But say that target is moving or starts moving away the carrier not given any further command will begin moving to keep the target in range but in so doing breaks their flying ATGM. Some kind of SA mode or just tweaking the AI of STAT tag weaponcarriers would just be just a nice quality of life change.More than one kind of bridge ...Seriously.

I would swap either the nasams or the etos howk for the swedish spaag vehicle I dont remember the name but the more expensive one.tank is fine.recon could use some work. take the scout defender take the base jaeger in a helo and another in ground transport. take the danish recon tank or autocannon recon vehicles instead.

Send out the bait plane make sure it gets seen by the enemy and is headed back towards your spawn then send out your ASF on a diagonal path. The AI will tunnelvision on the bait while you circle your ASF around to slot in on the enemy fighterinterceptors side or .
