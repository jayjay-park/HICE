3745741,0,t1_cqj87z1,Ill need a bit. Ive provided some examples for now. Edit wrong thread my apologies. Let me grab the links I was talking about.I already ran through some full threads for another poster so Im just going to take from my posts for time.Here is a post that received . Keep in mind that according to the system of voting and debates only things that are irrelevant utter bullshit trolling etc are meant to be down voted.gtAnd Id go to say that these people who make religious claims are demonstrably wrong. If a religious individual makes an empirical claim then by all means test it. But this is not necessarily inherent in religion. despite being on topic and factual.gtAs I said thats not inherent to religion even if it is to the loudest ones.AnothergtFor example a mentor of mine once had an atheistic patient with some severe nihilistic despair. The only thing that helped him was a regaining of certain beliefs most as simple as theres a higher power. He was able to find meaning and comfort in this and locwia much better life. For him there is nothing redunandant or false about his new ideology.A factual anecdote showing benefits of belief to religion which of course was downvoted.gtFor example a mentor of mine once had an atheistic patient with some severe nihilistic despair.

Seems to be the trick to getting upvotes around here.Edit thanks for proving a point!Because apparently biases cannot be an aspect of religion...gtNo but it can be an aspect of religion a bias due specifically to religious belief.Another poster recieving down votes for responding with this to a troll who admitted to trolling with of course no warning.gtMan what the hellNegative  heregtOf course any flaws claimed against the use or overuse of science are antiscientific propaganda made by heretical nonbelievers. Not religious at all The point doesnt even need to be that theres something actually mystical to meditation but belief in the mystical apparently leads to greater meditation benefits. That itself is supported by evidence. So when we deny the use of it because mysticism is nonscientific we are eliminating a superiorly useful tool because it contradicts our religious belief that religious ideas or practices have no possible benefits.May I stop? I mean this is only one thread and Im getting bored of the reread.,ReligiousEducation,cqj8mtl,1,t5_37x4k
