8694037,0,t3_4vs1ug,Im kind of confused about the concept of liability. Example I put a  bet backing Team A at odds . and I lay the bet with another bookmaker at odds . also . I understand that in theory one of these bets will give a return of more than  ie so there is a profit of . or . but then I forgot to account for the liability which is .. Where does this come from? What would my overall profitloss be in this situation? Thanks for any help!,GuidetoMatchedBetting,d6sdure,1,t5_3c58h
9341337,0,t1_d902o40,Yup play the long game. Its so worthwhile. Not sure what you mean with the liquidity question? You just enough to cover your bet stake. I wait in the queue a lot of the time for better odds but I wouldnt advise doing that when learning the ropes. ,GuidetoMatchedBetting,d902ykd,1,t5_3c58h
10114888,0,t3_5etxyt,Profit Accumulator are the most expensive and seem to regularly fail to inform their members of loopholes. I have been a pro gambler for a long time and am signed up to the other   Profit Max Profit Squad and Odds Monkey  let my PA sub expire. I figure I never know which one will have a loophole which could make me several grand in a day. There was a Sky loophole that was all over Profit Squad and PM which I made k on in a weekend no mention on PA. Then an epic William Hill fail where they let people clear the wagering requirements by betting an entire  deposit and bonus on one hand of blackjack which wasnt supposed to be eligible. P Accum advised doing  quids worth of spins on a random slot to give you a paltry EV whereas on Profit Squad they made it clear that there was a serious glitch ready to be exploited. As someone with a few friends helping him and a decent sized bank I walked away with k. It was a daily reload bonus of up to  quid but it turned out you could use it on all the various casino vegas and macau welcome offers too which I hadnt done. And Profit Accumulator is  quid a month! Profit Max is  after tax for a year but you have to buy additional software. Profit Squad is  a month or a  per year and like Odds Monkey no additional charges for software. But Profit Squad has a ridiculously profitable dutching strategy found nowhere else. You can dutch races that dont even have an extra place and make up to  of your total staked. Get on it. It will literally double your income from matched betting. They are clearly experts who wanted to make the best product not just rip off those who went before them like PA did to PM,GuidetoMatchedBetting,dbpz876,2,t5_3c58h

Thought Id use a new email for Matched Betting but mistakenly mistyped  letters the wrong way round when joining so signed up again and theyve suspended my account for possible duplicates! Hopefully theyll reinstate it as Ive just sent them an email explaining my mistake. Not telling them what Im doing of course,GuidetoMatchedBetting,deu2zcf,1,t5_3c58h
