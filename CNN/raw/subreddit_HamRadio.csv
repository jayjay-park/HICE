1983998,0,t1_cks6qkx,Got my license a year ago and have the same radio. Im in one of the oldest states in the country and its nothing but old timers rattling on about old timer stuff.

2651366,0,t3_2qallu,Do you use both bands?   Or one primarily?  Get an NMO single band whip instead of a dual band.  Theyre much lighter which will keep stress off the mount.  Theyre much cheaper too around . The whip is much more flexible as it doesnt need to support a coil.  It should hold up much better.  If you do need both bands you can use a small duplexer and install two whips a m and a cm. ,HamRadio,cn4nxfj,2,t5_2r1db

3358613,0,t3_2ymz8o,Youll get opinions on both sides of the fence... but for me I dont think QRP is the way to go when you first get started on HF.  I would hate to see you get frustrated with HF when it is difficult to make an SSB contact.Id rather suggest you spend that same  on a used QRO rig and turn it down to watts if you want to see how QRP works for you.  There are a LOT of used rigs available.,HamRadio,cpb3uuh,4,t5_2r1db

4495644,0,t1_csx49ta,I actually listened to a conversation on a m repeater about how bad the Chinese radios are. It was  guys and they went on and on for like  minutes. I was sitting on the dock July th after sleeping overnight on the boat because of traffic listening to them with a cup of coffee am in the morning. My little handheld programmed for m MURS FRS Sams Club and Marine frequencies too. lol I think I paid  dollars for mine on amazon. If it breaks throw it out. buy a new one. or keep a spare.

6531262,0,t3_42dpkj,I am a pretty green ham still. I have my general but have not been able to afford a HF radio yet. Would someone be able to run a low power radio like this with an amp to put out  watts to the antenna?,HamRadio,czuvu8x,1,t5_2r1db
6616572,0,t3_46amp8,You probably dont want to go directly to BNC or SMA  you still need something to hold the antenna upright.I would recommend getting a mirror mount to go from  stud mount to so. These are incredibly common used by CB and amateur radio alike.Then it depends on what cable you have. If you have a BNC cable get a BNC to PL adapter.  I would actually recommend that you just get a short run with PL connectors on either end then SO to whichever you need bnc or sma. Much more common and easily findable.,HamRadio,d03pkmj,1,t5_2r1db

Most community county state and federal agencies now have these emergencies down to the point hams just get in the way rather than beneficial.

8500361,0,t1_d63un3e,With repeater usage declining I actually see autopatches being more important than before.Just last weekend I was out hiking in an area without cellular coverage and the first thing I did was verify the autopatch on the repeater system Im a member of was functional.

9858454,0,t1_dasjqrt,gt I really dont see the purpose of radio if you cant use it for general gt or data communicationWith a few narrow exceptions Amateur frequencies are only for open twoway communications between you and other amateur stations  not for unspecified commercial or personal usage.Nobody owns or can exclusively monopolize a frequency.    Nobody is allowed to send unidentified messages.Nobody is allowed send messages that cannot be deciphered by other amateurs.  All comms on the bands are between amateurs or allowed rd party comms  so directing informationto the public broadcasting is out of bounds.Those are  some of the fundamental ground rules of the hobby.How are other amateurs going to hear your message if it is coded anyways?Im sure you can read a short poem to someone over the air without issue.    Provided the poem is in the public domain or a poem you wrote  and reading the poem is part of a conversation  Not a oneway broadcast.Running a numbers station or other broadcast station  would fall afoul of the Part  rules against OneWay communications.gt I really dont see the purpose of radio if you cant use it for gt general or data communicationIt has a purpose  but it sounds like you might have some ideas  in mind which require using a private service or purchasing a commercial license.You should probaby do some reading and learn what you actually can do   and what  the rules are  before you start coming up with details plans  on what you will do with comms   Otherwise be prepared to revise your plans.....,HamRadio,daskvl0,2,t5_2r1db

10522770,0,t3_5ljfg2,I think opposite of what everybody here thinks. I bought a freaking awesome ICOM  IC for under  and just for  bought a   meter ham stick. Stuck it to a mag mount from an old CB radio and put that on top of a  gallon steel paint can. I did add a few ground wires  but got from NW to NE USA down to Florida and Texas  Worked really really well. Lots and lots of contacts. The antenna can always be made with a dipole if you really want to go cheap and it works just as well  I eventually put up an  endfed dipole from ebay multiband for  or so to work all bands,HamRadio,dd0vbf4,1,t5_2r1db
