9860308,0,t1_dasijeu,The wool actually has no relation to making biodiesel. I was just curious about biodiesel because the concept of picking up the grease from fast food establishments is something Id like to use in a sheep based product. If you ever go to a farmers market you might come across a loofah made of sheeps wool. Its a bit of new product and you wouldnt really find it in a store. The loofah itself is typically made with types of wool that are undesirable to be used for anything. Farmers who raise sheep that produce this kind of wool typical just throw it out or burn it. Id like to implement the same system of how oil is picked up from fast food places to that of the waste wool from farmers. This product is for a contest at my college if you are wondering. If you have any other questions let me know Im not so sure I did the best job explaining this.,Biodiesel,dastki3,1,t5_2sb4q
