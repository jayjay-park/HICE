10052726,0,t3_5joagw,After reading this poem and your interpretation of the poem I just wanted to add to your thoughts on the title.  I interpreted the title as a metaphor length being the period of time an individual experiences happiness for and height being the time the effects and memory of happiness have on an individual.I agree that as this poem progresses the tone becomes depressing and sullen.  Through exploring Robert Frosts biography we learned he experienced the death of multiple family members.  As a result a common motif in his poems is loss and grief.  Going back to the title I think happinesss height causes depression. Frost likely felt depressed at times as a result of being able to remember experiencing happiness for memories cause an individual to recognize and miss what they no longer have.

His use of repetition of the word thousand suggests the load of responsibilities he still has ahead of him as he observes that there are still a lot left on the tree. This line also conveys a sense of concession and exhaustion he feels like giving up because there is still so much left to be done. ,WCHSpatterson,dcp9zqb,1,t5_3hm07

While I do agree with everything else youve said I think that Frost is attempting to come to terms with death.  He does this not by seeing death as the first step to rebirthrather he sees death as something that is inevitable.  Therefore why bother getting upset over it?,WCHSpatterson,dcqgkd2,1,t5_3hm07
