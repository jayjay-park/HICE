1598507,0,t3_2ckffo,Havent read the books but if I had to speculateThe Nazis or at least Nazi leadership were secret vampires with Hitler as the the catalyst for their plan to take over the world. There was some kind of vampire hunting clan in WWII Europe that for some reason consisted of only Jewish people.The concentration camps were an attempt by the Nazivampires to eradicate this group by killing all of the Jewish people in Europe since they couldnt necessarily identify the members specifically. While they succeeded in killing most of the group including dear old Abes lover Abraham managed to bring them down in the end most likely by seriously hurting the biggest baddest vampire and the Nazis lost the war.However the vampire resistance suffered great losses and now Abraham is the last of them still alive.

It has nothing to do with Palmer controlling the local news information and media and the internet being down. You can LITERALLY see the devastation with your own two eyes...and what about neighboring cities that have their own news coverage and news helicopters? Surely they would be reporting on this. Palmer cant control all of the news outside of the city. What about planes flying overhead and seeing the buildings on fire? Surely they would report it. Government satellites would have tons of photos of the devastation as well. The show makes it seem like the vampires are everywhere. Previous places of business are ransacked blood stained walls amp floors and they literally have dozens of vampires nesting at night in these places. Yet nobody seems to care...nobody notices this? How is there no massive uprising to fight the vampires? Like another poster noted...people in power are aware of the issue and are aware of what the vampires are because they developed a plan and eradicated the vampires from Staten Island and hung their bodies up to send a message. which was kind of stupid and would never happen...but whateverBut you still see people going about their daily jobs like nothing is wrong. There is no military presence no national guard...nothing...at least not that they are showing.  Hell they brought in the national guard to Ferguson MO because of a riot that spanned a few city blocks. This strain is taking over friggin New York City...and there is no armed presence at all aside from  guys in the subway that took Fet into custody?  Im sorry...but that is mindbogglingly ridiculous.I enjoy the show a lot...I really do even with its flaws.

Everyone except  people transformed at approximately the same time in the morgue yet were comatose prior to transformation. The  exceptions werent comatose.Some individuals develop high fever other can telepathically hear the Master while others are oblivious to his thoughts i.e. Kelly transformed and only heard the Master after her first kill while Nora could hear the Master prior to transformation.When would the nose fall off? It looks like resistance or another factor is involved especially as the eyes jaw throat and hearing have completed transformation. Telepathy comes somewhere in the transformation process. Quinlan or The Born has his nose and it doesnt appear to be fake.Can the Master control such transformation? Maybe?
