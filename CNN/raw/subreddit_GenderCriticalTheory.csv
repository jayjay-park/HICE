8080224,0,t1_d4oaf90,Secondary sources say that Morgan named Beth Elliott by name that there was a vote to ostracise Elliott things like that.  The I will not call a male she  is present but did Morgan go off script at that point?The rest is important context and Im glad to have read it.,GenderCriticalTheory,d4oajhb,1,t5_3f4jd
8187443,0,t1_d50y9ud,I guess what Im trying to ask is what the root cause of all this is. I think its clear to me at this point that my gender identity developed as a result of my AGP fetish but I dont understand why I had it in the first place. Keep in mind that except for in the recent months since Ive gone full time living as a female AGP fetishism has practically BEEN my sexuality my whole life. I can maybe count the times I orgasmed to something other than that pretransition on one hand.The only thing I can think of right now is that when I was a kid I was only attracted to women am attracted to both now but with a preference for men but was also very socially isolated. In particular I wasnt friends or even acquaintances really with any females outside of my family and so I could have become the primary target for my sexuality in place of others.I posted this here because most of the viewpoints I can find elsewhere either say that autogynephilia isnt real or that I am somehow fucked up and shouldnt have transitioned. From my own experience I can say that autogynephilia is very real and led to me developing a female gender identity that I now love expressing but I am confused as to why I had this fetish in the first place.,GenderCriticalTheory,d50zcti,1,t5_3f4jd
8190473,0,t1_d51bx2d,I gave you multiple examples telling apart these three concepts which you again decided to ignore. This is tiring. You are right in that gender and gender roles have a lot to do with each other but still theres a difference. A person cant refuse to being assigned a gender but they can refuse to fulfill gender roles. Also I defined the difference between gender and sex as I understand it. The first is an arbitrary set of characteristics the second isnt. If you cant follow or still disagree thats ok for me. I wont explain it even more. gt look at the lists of world records for running jumping lifting swimming etc etc and see how males are superior to females at every sport.Except for equestrian sports and a few others so literally males arent superior to females at every sport and what you just said is wrong. Look a little closer at lists of world records for those athletic disciplines you mentioned and the males or the females that set them up and you will find that literally none of them is below .m. Would you advocate for special leagues for smaller people? ,GenderCriticalTheory,d51czqj,1,t5_3f4jd

8337101,0,t3_4trovq,I think pretty much all psychological conditions can be observed on a continuum from the little bit which is normal to the extreme degree where it gets a name of its own  for example its quite normal for people to be a little bit OCD or a little bit autistic or a little bit anxious or a little bit depressed etc but it only gets an official diagnosis if it is severe enough to cause a serious problem.So yeah most people suffer a little bit from the pressure of the gender roles which are imposed on them and wish they could do some of the things which are supposed to be for the opposite sex  but theres a difference between those who want to be the opposite sex and those who want to be their own sex doing things outside their own gender role so perhaps a better term would be sex dysphoria for those who are unhappy with their physical body.,GenderCriticalTheory,d5joxae,4,t5_3f4jd
8379643,0,t1_d5mzsrp,gt  become male and female attributes and roles which enable a person of one sex to more easily portray themselves as the opposite sex even to the extent of totally convincing others that they are the opposite sexI gotta be honest thats where you lost me.,GenderCriticalTheory,d5p05mr,1,t5_3f4jd
