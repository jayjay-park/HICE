5848836,0,t3_3vbgz9,There are two other characters that Id like to see return as well even if its unlikely. The first is Da Samurai  he was strangely funny when he shouldve been annoying and itd be great to see if the character development he started to receive near the end of the episode he appeared in payed off. Also since the show is coming back on a block thatll allow it to be more mature hed be the go to outlet for that kind of humor the network is known for without damaging the show.The second character Id like to see make a reappearance is The Thief  As a shout out to Lupin III hes already got a lot going for him but he backs it up with some impressive skills and a sweet two parter with Jack in comic issues  and .

11104477,0,t3_5y8vzy,gtHe sends Jack thousands of years into the future and when Jack arrives he hears about it second hand and he hasnt come up with a plan to kill him yet.This is one that I dont think is a logic flaw at all.  Remember a key point Aku flung jack into the future he didnt throw him or send him or any other word that implies control.  Thats why Aku had to be told about it secondhand he flung Jack into the future and part of that flinging is that Aku doesnt know precisely at what point in the future Jack will arrive could be hundreds of years or thousands or tens of thousands.  Obviously with that kind of time frame involved having a plan ready to go doesnt make sense the environment will change Aku will grow more powerful and have more options open to him when Jack does arrive.  Aku doesnt know when and where Jack will show up again he just knows it will be someday so hes doing the sensible thing conquering the world consolidating his power so that when Jack does show up Aku is ready for him.  ,samuraijack,deqoljj,2,t5_2tlpl

Like she knew she had messed up versus this skilled warrior and in that mistake she was doomed. So she decided to do what she could and strike a blow that he wouldnt see until too late.

11319444,0,t1_dff0nq6,Yours isnt an unpopular opinion but I personally love that the series evolves as its story progresses. Each story arc takes on a different tone than the one that precedes itBlack Swordsman is a seemingly typical revengestory that plays up the horror elements and introduces the setting and principal cast.The Golden Agethe masterpiece of the series as far as character development goes is a more grounded story that focuses on military campaigns and political intrigue while developing its lovable cast of characters. The horror elements are more subtle and give the reader an ominous feeling that things will not turn out so well for the Band of the Hawk. Then the Eclipse happens...Conviction starts off as a continuation of Guts revenge plot before taking the story in a new direction by having him come to a realization about the selfishness of his actions and the negative effects it has had on his love. This is where the real story begins IMO of Guts growing as person.Hawk of the Millenium Empire is generally where a lot of fans begin to lose interest in my experience and part of that may be the massive tonal shift that accompanies it. This is where the story begins to move away from the horror elementsthough they are still there just less pronounced and towards a more whimsical fairytale tone. We are introduced to magic fantastical creatures and the Astral Plane.There is a much higher amount of comic relief and things are much more lighthearted as Guts is learning to open up to his new comrades.The story also begins to expand its scope with Griffith and his storyline achieving more focus. From this arc going forward Guts is no longer the central focus. Instead Griffith the main antagonist takes the spotlight and begins setting his worldchanging plan into motion. I actually consider this arc to be the pinnacle of Berserks storytelling so far.But I can see why people lose interest in it postEclipse.,samuraijack,dff1gb8,21,t5_2tlpl

And there is still my strongest reason for being bothered by this Jacks skin tone as a little boy was always the same whether he was with his parents or in Africa. Now theres a contrast between him and his parents and that wasnt a thing. No one actually found a good explanation for this. There was one guy that claimed they made his parents more asian but that makes no sense because its not like Jacks skin tone is still in the same color range and theyre just different tonalities. Theyre not in the same color range at all. Also god do I hope that frame is real. The Scottsman looks badass as fuck and his skin tone would still have a nice contrast to Jacks.,samuraijack,dffsjqh,1,t5_2tlpl

You have to realize that the audience of this show was in elementarymiddle school when it first aired and we are all adults now.See to me the more adult mature and realistic thing is that love doesnt always conquer all and there are some things bigger in life then a persons individual feelings. Therefore I think it would more of a mature move for Jack to leave Ashi for the past despite caring about her whether platonically or otherwise. Or if he does stay in the past he has reasons other then love for doing so. ,samuraijack,dfnm9p6,3,t5_2tlpl

11512253,0,t1_dg0qvrw,Being a Samurai has little to do with your preferred armaments. All Samurai means is To Serve. Theyre highly trained warriors who fight for the honor of the feudal lords but the only requirement regarding their weaponry was that the practice with it a LOT. There were even for a short time Samurai who used rifles over any other weapon. They... didnt last long. History didnt favor the Samurai.,samuraijack,dg0wz60,11,t5_2tlpl

Im not going full blind radical on him anymore but I need to know my enemy.Gets the full story from Jack who may have memorized it his whole life but itd be different telling it to a brainwashed minion. No doubt possibly triggering his existential crisis if mentioning how long hes been doing it. Maybe even befuddling Ashi more by saying Sometimes I wish I wasnt destined to do this. Sometimes I wish I would rather be someone else or do something else. But of course resume his heroics at the MegaRobot sceneLike now Ashi would now think My greatest enemy actually wishes he would NOT be doing this? Or some line similar to affect that might carry over into the next episode that would haunt her and question her purpose like Not apart of Akus order. or Everything you know every word you said IS WRONG!,samuraijack,dgb4lor,2,t5_2tlpl

When I was age  to  I could here sound frequencies emited from CRT televisions when the diodes would charge. Similar to when a camera flash charges except very high. Diodes are mini storage cells that are designed to release energy in a burst like a camera flash. Old CRT TVs needed diodes to shoot electricity to the Cathode Ray Tube.    Dogs and bird could probably hear those frequencies as well.,samuraijack,dgbn8lo,3,t5_2tlpl

Or see all the colors and landscapes Organscapes? in episode four?In terms of plot armor I dont think this season has been any worse than the previous seasons.

11625064,0,t1_dgbneu9,Maybe its intentional. Genndy should have made Scaramouch drop by and heckle in the first episode when the assassins were about to head out to kill Jack. That would make an impression on Ashi. So in this episode Ashi chooses clothings for Jack based on her impression of the first being she saw. Both to payoff the minor setup with clothings and Scaramouchs seemingly gratuitous appearance and make Jack think Ashi is deeper and more caring than she appears.,samuraijack,dgdpo4p,1,t5_2tlpl

11787242,0,t1_dgw49ks,They kinda wrote themselves into a corner with this though. They cant just say this wont happen because the time portal can...well...predict the future. If Aku were to destroy it now it would have known that would happen because it would have seen it a long time ago and it would not have conjured that image of Jack. Unless they do a serious retcon on that specific time portal this seems pretty inevitable to me. edit typo,samuraijack,dgw4g0h,4,t5_2tlpl

11802707,0,t1_dgxve2k,I think the episode  show me the world part was essential to show the amount of depth of Akus destruction though i do agree that some parts couldve been slightly shorter.Yeah agreed on episode  i think the reaper part was really underwhelming considering that he had this shroud of mystery up until that point.And i think the entire army scene in episode  was a bit dragged out but provided nice juxtaposition between Jack and Ashis scenes. Maybe they dragged the army scene out to complement Jacks meditation sequence?,samuraijack,dgxvm23,3,t5_2tlpl
11804452,0,t1_dgxogau,Anime often has the two used with the same character or at least in the same scene the characters are having a peaceful day when suddenly enemies attack.
