1583782,0,t3_2cd2r4,I dont live too far from you and cycle through Farringdon to get to work. I use Blackfriars to cross and its not too bad at all. Just watch for traffic turning left at the end of the bridge and be a little careful at Ludgate Circus  I tend to take a whole lane. Cycling in London isnt as bad as you think it is. Once you get over the initial fear youll be grand. Suggest going the route on a Sunday first as its much quieter and good to build confidence. ,londoncycling,cjet3xo,2,t5_2wcdj

1616249,0,t3_2cruhu,Sorry... I might be missing the point. But just sticking your iPodphonewhatever in mono mode and wearing one ear bud is a pretty good compromise no? I mean there probably arent many reliable statistics on cycling with headphones since people havent been having the debate that long but its obvious isnt it? Personally I like to know how big the vehicle about to overtake me is and also listen to my tunes. Im also not too worried about tarnishing cyclists because Im not sure I give a shit about maintaining some kind of cultural image Im also a driver and a pedestrian but I dont worry about tarnishing the image of those modes of transport. The sooner certain groups stop identifying themselves as cyclists like theyre some kind of subculture the sooner we can just be people getting to work.Agree with OP get on the saddle and keep your eyes open youll be just fine. ,londoncycling,cjiw84r,2,t5_2wcdj

2894514,0,t1_cnwzftf,Exactly. Spouting crap such as  Cyclists see no point in being ruled by stupid oneway signs or waiting idly at red lights but pretending that this is a positive thing is no more helpful than saying its negative.

7434210,0,t3_4h43pw,Theres a crap video on liveleak the rider arrives just at the end of the incident but it appears that only a bike was driven over not any riders.It surprises me that they managed to get that sort of reaction from the police but Im sure theyll be happy with it. CM seems to me to be aimed at enflaming tensions between drivers and cyclists not promoting any sort of coexistence.Itd be nice if there was a friendly alternative to CM  large group rides of people out to enjoy the city following traffic laws and being courteous to driver pedestrians and other cyclists,londoncycling,d2n80hw,1,t5_2wcdj
7477229,0,t3_4hr3rz,Couple of suggestions on your route I cycle in from Wallington so have a bit of experienceI would pickup the a from Coulson and follow it all the way up until it becomes London road in Tooting. Traffic will be fairly busy but will also be at a standstill for a lot of that route. You can cut through the pedestrianised bit in Mitcham to avoid the one way system on Google maps as London Road in dark grey. Follow it all the way up until you get past Tooting Rail Station on the junction with Southcroft Road. Turn onto Southcroft then a left onto Rectory Lane. Follow this up to Church Lane then cut into Tooting Common.After Tooting Common follow Cavendish Road all the way to the S Circular. Left turn onto the S Circ then right onto Klea Ave followed by a left onto Narabone Ave. This will bring you out facing Clapham Common cycle across the common and pickup your original route. Cedars RoadQueenstown road are busy with stationary traffic but theres a good bus lane. I sometimes cut up the back streets round Sloane Square sometimes go up Sloane Street either way is usually fine.The rest of the route looks alright you might fine a quickerbetter way to do it. To give an idea on timing I usually do my route in  minutes Google estimates . Thats cycling from Wallington to near Kings X.Good luck! ,londoncycling,d2s49iu,1,t5_2wcdj

8427188,0,t3_4v1nsl,Buy a dlock. Insure your bike house insurance is best. Stop worrying.You dont need to make your bike impossible to steal. You just need it to be more difficult to steal than the one next to it.Small dlocks are better than large ones. Consider adding a separate cable lock if you are leaving it somewhere particularly dodgy for a long time. Better to have two different styles of locks requiring to techniques to break than two of the same kind even if they are technically better.,londoncycling,d5uxujv,4,t5_2wcdj

11472734,0,t3_63opul,I was in a similar situation and got a new NoLogo bike  Its simple basic does the commute just fine. Could be an affordable option if you dont want to navigate the second hand market. The LFGSS types will sneer but you can graduate to that later.Yes you should definitely lock your bike whatever you get end up getting  budget for two locks to keep it secure. You only need your bike to look less nickable than the one next to it which seeing how poorly people lock bikes in London aint difficult. Big dlock through the back wheel and frame to the rack different smaller lock or chain or cable through the front wheel and frame also to the rack. Job done.,londoncycling,dfwfgnw,1,t5_2wcdj
