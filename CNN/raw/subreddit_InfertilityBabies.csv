72154,0,t3_1ux174,This is the same birth defect our son has.  The good news is the ratio does get smaller after about  weeks.  The bad news is it gets harder and harder to see on ultrasound.  Ive been cleared for vaginal delivery but it has to be in a hospital with a level III NICU in case our baby goes into respiratory distress.  However both my MFM and the doctors down at CHOP dont think that will happen.PM if you want to talk more.,InfertilityBabies,cemn6kk,1,t5_2vy6k

145899,0,t3_1vpwwt, weeks and feeling pretty good overall. Ive been waking up with back pain the last  mornings but luckily it has gone away within a few hours. This morning I woke up with some weird twingy pain that comes and goes in my lower right abdomen but since Im feeling headbutts in my cervix Im assuming hes just hanging out in that area punching my nether regions. I had a great yoga class yesterday and am seeing the benefits from working out. I started getting fat knees last week but I think the treadmill has helped with that. Ive put on about  lbs since I found out I was pregnant which I think is on par.Labor classes are going well except for the fact that Im still annoyed by our instructor shes like a Disney mother character. Hubs is taking on the classes like a champ and has been so attentive to what relaxation methods work for me. The nursery is almost done too! We FINALLY got our Pottery Barn glider in that we ordered in October on Friday and I love how comfortable it is. My mom picked up the material to make curtains this weekend so hopefully shell have those done before our shower on Feb . And the last piece of furniture is a nightstand to put next to the glider which arrive cracked but I should have the replacement piece this week. Its all coming together!OH and one more thing  we had sex this week and it was AWESOME! Like prepregnancy sex. My drive has been way down and when we have had sex on the rare occasion it has been awkward so I was thrilled to find our flame again.,InfertilityBabies,cev1ru3,2,t5_2vy6k

298969,0,t3_1xg0z0,I just checked about this and it looks like you cant donate cord blood if you are expecting twins.    Q. Can I donate if Im having twins? A. No public cord blood banks can only accept donations when one baby is expected. With twins each umbilical cord has different tissue types and its possible the two cord blood units could be mixed up during collection.,InfertilityBabies,cfbr5lg,2,t5_2vy6k

505802,0,t1_cfxg50j,Pretty well really. Shes been really excited about the baby talking about it all the time although shes of the opinion that the whole growing a baby process is taking too long and is boring. We were a little worried she would be disappointed it was a boy as shes a bit wary of boys at the moment theyre too rough but shes actually been really happy with it. She loved the bedroom move yesterday and was even willing to leave a few toys and books behind in her old bedroom for the baby to use. Im not sure how shes going to handle the concept that the pregnancy is hurting me. Ive been saying Ow and Oof a lot and she keeps asking why I said that and I dont want to give her the idea that pregnancy really hurts but at some point were going to have to make it clear that I cant do as much as I used to. My husband is taking up a lot of the slack. Weve known this was probably going to happen again so weve been prepared but it still doesnt make the reality suck any less. Im doing okay its just painful and disappointing. I know it will end and Im feeling a lot more baby movements now which really does help me cope. Im just going to have to take it more slowly than I want to. Theres so much to do and I cant do it all. ,InfertilityBabies,cfxrgn9,1,t5_2vy6k

And honestly once your stomach starts getting a little bigger that can be really reassuring too.Frankly the OB appts are anticlimactic after the RE.  With the OB all they do is measure fundal length take your weight check for protein in your urine and listen to the baby.  With the exception of the protein thing I can do all that at home.  Its the  week ultrasound that is cool.,InfertilityBabies,cggt3ax,1,t5_2vy6k

788666,0,t3_236a8t,My RE didnt have me use OPKs. He did blood work and ultrasound to determine when to trigger ovidrel shot. After the trigger we did our IUI  hours after trigger.

848891,0,t3_23um9i,My daughter likes to poop on me.  Its always such a stand off.  Ill hear her butt shoot off into her diaper well lock eyes and we both know the game is afoot.  Then I wait.  I wait a few minutes for more poop.  Nothing.  We go into her room.  I lay her on the changing pad.  We wait for more.  Nothing.I slowly take off the diaper and peek inside.  There is poop inside oh yes but not ALL the poop.  More poop is coming.  I just need to wait it out.I close the diaper.  Rub her belly.  She stares at me.  She knows this game and shes good at it.  She always wins.  I cant wait anymore.  I open the diaper.  I start wiping her at the ready when near her butthole as I know wiping there has the potential to turn on the poop fountain.  Nothing.Maybe shes done I think.  Oh should I know better.  Shes not done.  Shes never done.  This is her plan.I take off the dirty diaper clean diaper ready in my other hand.And in the half a second when she is naked to the world my precious baby girl explodes with poop shooting it across the room with force I didnt think possible of the human bunghole.  There is poop on her changing pad.  There is poop on the dresser.  There is poop on the diaper genie.  There is poop on the hamper.  There is poop on the rug.  There is poop on the end table all the way across the room. There is poop on mommy.And its the best thing ever.  I have a daughter!  Shes here!  She poops!

947359,0,t1_chbvuwy,We looked into that but ended up getting them the smallest full size cribs that we could find. Our reasoning was that those convert to toddler beds and as difficult as itll be to fit two cribs into our house it would actually be impossible to fit twin sized beds.

One of the neat side effects of the scan is that it tells you gender.  Ours told us we were having a girl.  But the ultrasounds CLEARLY showed a boy.  So we were left uneasy about issues the whole rest of the pregnancy.  He came out all boy and totally normal so the test was wrong.  The hospital said they had two other women around the same time come back with different genders than their scans showed.  Not the end of the world but it caused just as much unease as it cured.  ,InfertilityBabies,chtkpvo,1,t5_2vy6k

I wore the hospital gown which fit fine with my robe over it. I bunched it up behind me or pulled it off when I was inon the bed so that I wouldnt mess it up if I had a leak but it kept me comfortable to move around the room a bit even with visitors there. I showered the morning I went home only  days since I had a vaginal delivery and put on my own clothes then a pair of yoga pants and a maternity top with flipflops because I still couldnt get shoes on.

There are multiple gods but theirs is the one true God because he doesnt use pornography smoke or drink.  If youre a bastard born out of wedlock your family will be condemned to hell for  generations said while the brides niece born out of wedlock Sat in the front row  They had a PowerPoint about heathens.  They speak in tongues!  A woman who loves God knows nothing but to submit to her husband all marriages must be based on male decisions or God will condemn you.  Being born again is like pulling yourself out of a toilet full of feces and those feces are not your friends and family theyre conspirators of Satan who want to pull you back in.

Not just because she wasnt gaining weight  but not enough wet diapers.  I still nurse at night amp  times a day  but it was the biggest pain for a while. Quick notes  cause I only have a minute.Pain  make sure to get some milk on your nipples and let it air dry each time you feed get out of the shower etc. Feels weird but really helps. Pumping  definitely check out rbreastfeeding. They have a wealth of info there. I personally get more if I pump for  turn off for  and pump for another . But from what Ive read you dont want to pump more than  mins or  mins past when you stop getting milk cause too much pumping can hurt your tissue. Good luck! You can do this!!

The cat has stopped hating on me for the scary labor sounds of transition before we left for the birth center and has started accepting Carson as well. I pumped for the first time today not introducing bottle until at least tomorrow or Monday but I wanted to give it a shot. It was interesting. I failed at learning both how to pump AND how to use the hands free bra at the same time. Always tomorrow  Still not allowed to drive pissing me off. I feel fantastic physically and keep missing my Motrin doses because of it. Im glad Im healing great but now Im just annoyed that Im not allowed to do all the things.

The main selling feature to me with cloth was how fucking cute babies butts look in those fluffy diapers. The savings were just an added bonus. From what I have in my small stash so far I think Ill like pocket style but until our kid fits into them and the meconium poop is done well be using prefolds and a cover. My understanding is that meconium is water soluble just as EBF poop is so it all just goes into the washer until you start on solids.There were a few youtube accounts Plus one please and Naturally Thrifty Mom that have a cloth diapering  playlist.

3345068,0,t3_2ygfwd,Im exclusively pumping though I hope those days are numbered and heres what Ive worked with Medela Symphony rental double electric.  Everyone said over and over to rent a hospitalgrade pump Id need it.  Well  actually I already had a pump and my experience is that it works better than the Symphony. Spectra S consumer grade double electric  no one seems to have heard of this except the BFingEPing community but its utterly amazing.  Its fully compatible with Medela  if you have Medela pump parts flanges PersonalFit Connectors etc. all you need is an extra pair of Pump In Style hoses and youre good to go.  It also has an internal battery so it can be used cordless if you want.  I love this thing.  If you dont need the battery the Spectra S is the same pump but with no battery backup and is much cheaper. Medela Harmony manual  I have this for emergency backup and for pumping out of the house.  I do find it a little tedious but my flow is pretty slow it takes me a half hour on a double electric pump.  You might very well find that this is all you need.  I do love it.  It has a letdown option and a regular pumping option and both work great.  It is MORE comfortable than the double electrics IMO because you have so much immediate control over how fast the suction is.As for whether you can get away with just a manual or not it will really depend on what your BFing situation is once your babys born  its hard to predict in advance.  I did buy the Spectra before I had the baby and its a damn good thing I did because we couldnt breastfeed right away.  But if hed been able to latch and feed right at the start I might have just gotten the Harmony.  As it is Im glad to have both.  If you get a manual now you can always rent or buy a double electric if you find you need it and you wont regret having the manual at all.,InfertilityBabies,cp9k9hj,2,t5_2vy6k

Secondary according to the only organization supporting any of us is when baby  comes without any intervention or hardship.  According to that definition bandgeek doesnt qualify she never ever left us.  I know her experience of TTC was full of hardship.  Dookie I dont know your history but maybe you dont qualify either but I dont really want to get that technical because it sounds like rating someones hard.  I appreciate your understanding that neiner neiner on the main IF sub stings like the attack of the killer yellow jackets but I dont begrudge yall graduating and plenty are participating without talking about cute kid .  Theres no way I could with the amount of support I have received from bandgeek in multiple TTCrelated subs since I stopped lurking on reddit  years ago.  I think maybe if I got lucky with one and couldnt have another it would be a different kind of hurt and longing and its probably easier to swallow now than the fuck no my body is giving me but honestly I imagine in fact I think this is what I hate about all of this is that the feelings of sad are really never going to go away for the rest of my life regardless of shortterm outcomes.,InfertilityBabies,crtntsu,5,t5_2vy6k

4408158,0,t3_3binu1,We had a successful fresh transfer with our first round of IVF. I was  at the time and chose to transfer two embryos. My Dr strongly recommended one because multiple pregnancies are high risk and being young and healthy unexplained infertility so no idea why I hadnt been pregnant before a twin pregnancy was more likely. In the long run I was right. Transferring two very high quality embryos resulted in a single pregnancy. There are so many factors that go into the choice. I think for me I crunched numbers. I was more likely to get pregnant if we transferred two embryos. Whether it was a single or twin pregnancy. We have two frozen embryos left and ifwhen we do a FET I will transfer both.

He has the occasional episode of apnea with bradycardia but by the time the nurse silences the alarm hes already recovered on his own.  At this rate he will be the first one to come home. Asher isnt doing poorly hes just taking his time. He was in a crib for a couple of days but couldnt stay warm so he went back in the isolette yesterday evening. Hes also been having a lot more apneaBrady episodes theyll happen in clusters meaning hell go down recover a bit go down recover a bit etc. Hes still on L nasal cannula because of his trouble breathing. Hes taking the bottle like a champ though and hes up to  bottle feeds a day amp gaining weight well also. Nursing him has gone a little slower but Im hopeful tomorrow will be a good day! Weve got everything set up and ready for them to come home!

4640946,0,t3_3ehuc9,We got married in  but didnt start trying until . I went off birth control in July and when I still wasnt pregnant in May  my GP sent me to an RE.  Our first appointment was in September  and we were diagnosed with severe MFI  and told that we were going straight to IVF with ICSI.  It was quite a shock for a very first appointment. My testing showed an absurdly high AMH  pmolmL as well as several other markers which lead to a PCOS diagnosis normal for my age is  to .  But before we did IVF my RE also wanted to test my endometrial lining. This is the test I was most resistant to  because he had been involved in the research and it was a USD test Im in Canada  so everything except the AMH test had been covered so far. Im glad we did it  my lining on on a work cycle appeared to be   days older than it should  which means that perfectly good embryos wouldnt be able to implant. So I went on lupron for  months starting Feg  artificial menopause to reset my lining  and upon retest  I was only  day off. We did the IVF in Aug to September  a transfer in October and my  month old is currently sleeping on my boob.

I cant give any specialist referrals in your area since we live in Germany but Im happy to share any info on what our experience was like if you have specific questions.  The biopsy my husband didnt get the fineneedle aspiration they did a full biopsy it kinda sucked but was worth it.  He was back at work within  hours and riding a bike within a week. ended up containing several immature and around a dozen mature sperm which were frozen.  Several months later I began medication for IVF and we ended up doing a  day transfer of two blastocysts. One stuck.  Healthy pregnancy and birth.  What I really liked about our doctor was how he managed to be really positive and encouraging while being extremely honest about the statistics which were not in our favor.  I feel like he really helped to prepare me for various outcomes and didnt give us a false sense of hope.

How are your renovations going?Ive heard other twin moms say sometime between  weeks is when the pregnancy just got really harduncomfortable.

Upon waking up I find my hips underbelly arms etc sore and often trying to get out of bed makes my ribs hurt. Ugh. I tried moving to the recliner this morning but I only got  minutes before my back was aching. I can get reasonably comfortable sitting during the day though Im down to just a couple of positions there too which is making my tail bone ache. Im really glad now that I got most of what I wanted to do done earlier. I have just a couple more things to power through and then I can veg out in a sleep deprived state as needed.

I think he was just wedged up against the placenta and I couldnt feel it because immediately prior to the NST I felt a bigger movement and then felt a lot more movement during the NST.

5619911,0,t1_cwtp8dw,Yeah its hard because its this full on grief process every single month if not more. You have hope then its dashed. Plus you get constant reminders of that grief  as if someone you loved died and you keep seeing pictures of them everywhere and people that look like them and people keep asking you how that person is because they dont know they died. Then theres the uncertainty of testing and treatment which comes with a huge cost as well and this feeling like youre failing at a basic human thing. I think it is just really hard to explain what its like if you havent been through it which is understandable but its good that youre not making assumptions or trying to say I understand because it took us  months to conceive or something similar which Ive heard before.

She understood immediately and I think it made her family feel less aloneknowing that we had endured so many MC and failed IVF and still carried on a fairly normal life. Fertility is not easy for everyone and that is an important message.How have ppl responded when you have said youve tried for yrs. Did they pry and ask if you did fertility treatments? I think youre right...maybe it would be healthy just to bite the bullet and find a similar phrase to deter the questions that I dont identify with. Are you excited? has to be the stupidest one of all to me right now.

6845683,0,t3_49idvz,Coming to terms with the fact that I will need a prescription if Im ever pregnant while parenting. Sleeping  hours a day immobile for at least a few more while just fighting the nausea. No work luckily barely keeping on top of hygiene. In the middle of a week with at least one social plan per day. But not.actually.vomiting. so its hard to think I need a prescription. I have been thinking about it this way if I didnt have the option to rest I probably would be vomiting. Although spoiled as I have always been with staying home from schoolwork while sick I literally cant imagine forcing myself to do anything. Like why?? Privilege showing. My midwife is off this month which is letting me drag my feet about it. Im also already taking the b so that pretty much rules out the safest prescription to take and its hard to imagine taking anything else if I can get away without it. ,InfertilityBabies,d0s9j81,3,t5_2vy6k

But that doesnt take away from the fact that there are many things about pregnancy that suck many things that are uncomfortable and for some many things that are downright unbearable. Lets drop the guilt about complaining about pregnancy because you went through infertility to get here. Nothing about the path to this place changes the fact that your body is going motherfucking crazy right now with hormones and changes. And first trimester is awful and feels endless and has no compensations like feeling the baby move or having a bump to make it feel real or being far enough along that you can make concrete plans or anything at all. Its the beginning and as soon as the initial excitement of OMG! It happened! wears off its all a load of sucks.Theres often a few things you can do to helpask around to find out what these things are and then go out and do them.

7570301,0,t3_4ixim6,My AMH was lowish but okay all my other numbers were shit so it was all one egg at a time.Because I was making an egg on my own every month the protocol for me ended up being natural cycle IVF.... low or no drugs I took Clomid unless my FSH was ridiculous that month and then we retrieved whatever was there ICSId it to be sure it fertilized since it was just one and then if it was good wed transfer it back in fresh. Owing to personal weirdness I had one frozen too.Natural cycle is often cheaperno drugs less monitoring less work for embryologybut Ive heard its much harder to find a doctor willing to do it in the USA. A slightly more common alternative is miniIVF where its a small amount of stim to aim for a small number of eggs. Ministim for me was Letrozole and Menopur and I got  egg out of it. The thinking in both cases is that if all the drugs will not make a ton of eggs why take all the drugs?Its a lot trickier to time since you arent taking anything to delay ovulation although I did trigger so go time is go time and with one egg you really have to get it when its just right. On the other hand fewer eggs means its physically a lot easier on the body.Natural cycle IVF has a very low success rate but thats because IVF success is highly correlated with the number of eggs so like one egg  shit odds. That said because it was not so expensive we were able to do a lot more rounds.... I got lucky on round .If she is making eggs on her own or can get at least one without much stim it may be a good option for her. But it will mean having to do it over and over and over again.,InfertilityBabies,d32pftk,3,t5_2vy6k

8110399,0,t1_d4rjuc9,Thanks! So I did all of my manic googling a few days ago I have some level of selfcontrol today?? and havent looked once but in Europe APECV is a nogo. They wont even attempt it bc its higher risk. I think its what gives me so much pause. Of course Im scared of them hurting her but the placenta is her first line of defense and its more likely that theyd hurt me. Im picturing them tearing it away from the uterine wall. The OB said AP isnt a big deal but the internet seems to disagree.It is kind of annoying that your midwife wouldnt even try to tell you. My OB told me based on feel at the last  appts. I know she hasnt budged since then bc her head is so distinct and hard up on my right side. I never feel kicks in this areaonly rollslike the kind your neck makes haha. Its comforting that you get that last scan to check head size position fluid etc. I think I get one more lowbudget scan prior to ECV if I decide to do it. It is really stressing me out bc my husband keeps going soandso had a csection and kids after. Yea I get that but they can have all the damn free sex they want. It is so much pressure that we have ONE more attempt EVER. And we know they are PGS normal. If that FET fails I dont want to come back to this decisionpoint and be like shit I made the wrong decisions w my stupid uterus.,InfertilityBabies,d4rok4t,1,t5_2vy6k

8437084,0,t3_4v7ncj,For name At this point I would simply state you still deciding on the name and refuse to discuss it. This baby can be raised by you two with a huge supportive extended family network but they do not need to be named by the entire network. If they want a specific reason Id say that you and husband talked it over and decided this was something you wanted to discuss as a family and possibly mention something about trying to include his family names in there too. Then stop discussing it. Or tell them you naming the baby Baby McBabyface. For talking about baby I just dont give details. I answer most questions with simple one word answers or say my husband and I are still thinking about it and we dont know if it relates to something we want to do. Theres a limit to how much conversation can be had with someone who is effectively not conversing. Therapy This sounds like a great topic to ask your therapist about. You are  not the first person to have this problem and she may be able to give you some stronger talking points. Also I feel like people think that for whatever reason getting pregnant once just fixes all the infertility issues so planning for baby   etc wouldnt ever be an issue. I dont quite understand this perspective but have heard people articulate it as well now that its happened once your body will just know what to do. ,InfertilityBabies,d5w6b6x,4,t5_2vy6k

Thankfully the SCH hasnt grown hasnt shrunk either... but according to my wifes OB its good that it hasnt grown and he was a lot less pessimistic this visit.

Measuring right on track heart rate of  arms and legs and four heart chambers and a bladder and the right number of cord blood vessels and all the rest. Because her NT measurement was good and shes PGSed the MFM we met with after my scan thinks doing the sequential screen bloodwork is totally unnecessary. I agree. My cerclage will be on Tues. or Wed. Scheduling it had been a bit of an organizational clusterfuck and mostly my OBs fault for being a bit scattered around the time both she and the MFM managing me went on vacation. But...Im being assured that by Friday every detail will be straightened out and the surgery will happen next week and from there on out I should feel secure.

I began counseling after the loss of my son at  weeks of pregnancy and the same counselor has carried us through the intervening two years infertility treatment ectopics losses and this subsequent pregnancy.  Since OP asked for specific experiences  IVF worked for me on the first try.  But I didnt have eggsperm quality issues just poopy tubes and slightly lazy ovaries.

Went to dinner last night and she called me fat which because of morning sickness Ive actually lost  lbs. as far as I last knew Then tried to convince my husband to get rid of his goatee and lip rings because itll harm the baby and the hair will give it a rash. No joke then my husband brought up my BIL whos had a beard for both his children with no rashes on his kids also if he cant have facial hair he might as well shave his head while hes at it because it could harm the baby. I giggled inside when he was telling them that. Also they keep telling him that he needs to make more money and work more yet hey we are going to Vegas the grand canyon and Tacoma you should come with! How is that productive in making money to save for the baby. Then they kept insisting that it MUST be a girl they dont want any more boys and she should have blue eyes so they can have a beautiful blue eyed whitePhillipino baby girl! My husband got more mad at that then I did Im a little excited to see if blue beats out brown. Then they got back to trips and are wanting to take my  week old new born to the Philippines its like a  hour flight from Chicago to there. Are they nuts!!!

9051907,0,t3_544hfm,This is my opinion so take it or leave it whatever you like. If I was in your position and ECV was a no go I would plan for the csection and in the meantime try different yoga positions to get baby to move. I had a vaginal birth with my daughter and things went fairly smoothly but at the start it was pretty scary. Had to be induced because I had gestational diabetes when they broke my water the fluid was merconium stained contractions stalled so I had to have the drip triggered back labour and pain was so intense I was delirious every contraction we were losing my daughters heartbeat and my blood pressure was skyrocketing. Going in I wanted to avoid a csection because I wouldnt have as much support for as long as I would need to recover after the surgery but if that what would have been safest for my baby I would have done it in a second. Both of my SIL had scheduled csections due to broken waters and both went very well there are no significant differences between my nephews and my daughter except ya know theyre boys and shes not but I doubt that was impacted by birth! both boys were prem and have thrived. Its better to make the choice now and be in control than to try and make a decision midlabour.,InfertilityBabies,d7zw89i,1,t5_2vy6k

With the initial shake switch we had a few days at  a few days at  a few days at  a few days at  a few days at  and now were at the past three days at  or  ounces a day.  Ive got an appointment with the pediatrician tomorrow shes been out of town but Ive talked to her and her nurse on the phone over the weekend.  They each gave me their personal cell phone numbers!  She said as long as hes having wet diapers the  or  ounces are ok for a few days till she gets back into town and can see him and decide if we need to be admitted to a hospital.  I agreed because I didnt want to have to spend time in the ER deal with a new doctor because she was out of town and have to relay Finns history for the umpteenth time.  The nurse put it best when I talked to her saying that hes just being a little shit about eating.  I love the bugger but that pretty much sums it up and my husband has said it MANY times already.  Right now I can only get the  or  ounces in him while hes asleep.  If you try while hes awake he just smiles and laughs at you and pushes the bottle out with his tongue.... Im guessing feeding therapy or an NG tube are going to be our next steps.,InfertilityBabies,d8c6clw,3,t5_2vy6k

In addition she didnt have kids so BACK THE FUCK OFF.

9456889,0,t3_5a9138,The NIPT that I was offered tested for chromosomal abnormalities for    and XY.  I was also offered an enhanced version that tested for an additional  chromosomal abnormalities but the false positive rates on those were much much higher and the abnormalities much rarer.  I believe the difference between the NIPT and the CVSamnio is that the NIPT only tests for that handful of genetic abnormalities and gives you risk not definitive answers where with the CVS you can get the full karyotype and know for certain.  We did PGS so the genetic counselor that we met with said that we could do the NIPT for reassurance if we wanted to but the PGS should have caught anything really which we ended up doing since it wasnt invasive.  The decision of whether we wanted to do the enhanced version was much more difficult.  The enhanced looks for some microdeletions which PGS does not test for.  However its a much newer test the false positive rates are much higher and if we had tested positive for anything I knew Id want to do an amnio which as you mentioned comes with its own risks.  In the end we decided not to do the enhanced testing.  The counselor did offer us the chance to go straight to amnio.  I had four losses and the last two we were able to do testing and confirm genetic abnormalities.  Im also  years old.  Im not sure if thats an option for all patients or if they only offer it to patients that have had certain types of losses are of a certain age etc.  Do you have the opportunity to meet with a genetic counselor or will you be discussing with your OB?  Its certainly worth discussing.  I had always thought that I would take ANY noninvasive testing available to me.  Even though it was still just a blood test once I had the information about the false positives for the enhanced testing the rate of occurrence for the disorders the risk of miscarriage for amnio...it was an interesting process to come to the conclusion that I didnt want to do it.  ,InfertilityBabies,d9eq7uf,3,t5_2vy6k

The learning curve has been ok but Im still planning to go to a breastfeeding support group tomorrow to get more reassurance or advice on specific BF stiff. Today shes sleeping like a beast so I think were at a growth spurt. Hoping I dont pay for it tonight!As far as birth heres a link to the nitty gritty Baby Loves birth but to answer your questionsBefore I was induced baby was quite low and I think walking a lot and trying out spinning circles on my exercise ball helped a lot with that. I could feel her engage more when I rocked out to salsa music on there!. Supposedly if baby is engaging well and you have gravity helping out that should help get the cervix to cooperate. During labor I sat on a birth ball and tried the same things but I did not progress well on pitocin alone at the beginning. However I dont think the contractions were really productive ones anyway. For a lot of people the concern with the epidural is that is can prolong labor so I was hoping to hold put until cm or so but sometimes it helps the body to relax. I think that was the case with me because I didnt have dilation until the epidural and my water was broken breaking the waters is also often a big lets get this shiz going point. Once youre on the epidural youll have a catheter placed and youll have to remain on the bed. I was basically on my side or back from that point on. So all of my but birthing class said use gravity! was out the window. Honestly it was a relief to have the catheter because during labor before that the IV is pumping fluids so you still have to pee often  and that is an annoying process call nurse get disconnected from the monitor drag your poll to the restroom try to hover over the potty while contractions are going get back to the bed again wait to be rehooked up when the nurse remembers you again. Repeat every hour at least....,InfertilityBabies,da1oz7x,1,t5_2vy6k

9812129,0,t1_dambmfb,We started trying out a routine around  weeks and it really did help with all of our sleep but we didnt do any formal sleep training until much much older. For us the key to getting better sleep was putting the baby in his crib for the first stretch of the night swaddled and with a pacifier he would sleep for  hours at that point and then after his first middle of the night wakeup I would bring him in to the bassinet in our bedroom so I could snooze between other wakings. At that point my husband would usually sleep through most of it so he would be decently rested when he went to work.For a bedtime routine we did baby massage with moisturizer change into pjs and fresh diaper swaddle turn on white noise LOUD white noise is key fed while baby was drowsy and then put him in the crib with the pacifier while he was drowsy but still awake. The Wubbanubs stayed in his mouth better at that age.Blackout drapes and a white noise machine really helped with nighttime sleep for the baby and eventually helped with naps though it took much longer for him to get consistent about napping. We used the Snuza monitor until he started rolling over a lot and knocking it out of position and had a video monitor so I didnt feel too anxious about putting him in a separate room to sleep and I slept much better so it was ultimately worth it.,InfertilityBabies,damjzlh,1,t5_2vy6k

Most of the milestones that people get excited about finding out the sex the anatomy scan feeling movement come along later in pregnancy so you might find it easier to be excited with time.  I really enjoyed looking pregnant.  I had some weird anxiety about buying things for the kiddo.  But I love baby clothes and I bought a few outfits in early second trimester which was a big milestone.  Thankfully all the stuff I bought early on was small so that I was able to chuck it a drawer out of sight for a few months when my pregnancy went to hell and then thankfully was able to pull back out.  Even letting myself wander the baby section again in stores was pretty fun during those early weeks.  I like your pinterest board idea!

Since supply is an issue for me if there is ever a next time Id probably just rent a hospital grade pump after delivery since I dont remember it being super expensive.  And the hospital pharmacy could have it delivered to my room to take home with me and if I dont end up needing no big deal.

Weve accomplished so much in the past two weeks well I did most of the accomplishing as my husband only had a one week break.Done We got our TDAP vaccines! I also finally got my flu vaccine. Infosession with our health insurance about administrative to dos and additional benefits. Still making up our minds if its better to take the gift of  in cash or  in their online health store valid for  years. Arranged kraamzorg post partum care with the health insurer. Basically someone who comes in the eight weeks postpartum for a maximum of  hours to help with baby and around the house. Cooking ironing cleaning though max  of their time can be spent cleaning minding the baby while I catch up on sleep doing a grocery run ... Its hour but the insurance covers hour for the first  hours! Some of my friends did this and swear it was golden others didnt do it and regret not getting the help. Im definitely getting those first  hours and I may even pay in full for the other . Prepped babys suikerbonen bonbonnire folded  teensie tiny boxes and filled them with chocolate dragees and sugarcoated almonds. The boxes already have their ribbons all they need is a small tag with name and date of birth! Moved the Christmas tree amp decorations back to storage in the basement and put up babys cot in the living room. Well I think its called a cot its not a baby bed but I also dont think its a play pen as it has an adjustable base plate. Anyway it feels superreal now that babys on her way! Were two months and two days away from the EDD! We also finally mounted a narrow shelf in the living room for pictures frames etc as well as wall storage in the hallway. Not really baby related but good to have done before shes here! Got the big informational tour of the baby store and registered for gifts. Ill still be expanding the registry online but having the guidance really helped and we were able to try stuff out too. Got the registry out to some select people my mum my husbands parents the babys godmother plus a friend for proofreading purposes. Weve got a custom registry on wishlistr where we link to the store registry plus encourage people to buy stuff second hand theres no purchase obligation for anything at the store we registered as long as a minimum of five things get bought for a minimum total of  and theres several big ticket items that would definitely be totally fine in a second hand edition! share a bank account number for a diaper fund I think this is considered very tacky in the US but it is very much a common practice in Belgium as well as ask to please tone it down on the pink. Roughly translated Aint it grand how many options the rainbow grants? Id really love to receive nonpink colours too! My husbands parents already bought us the ERGO baby carrier we registered for as well as a very cute travel blanketpillow Baby showers are not a thing here most stuff gets bought around the time of the birth.Of course theres still plenty stuff left on the to do list but were geting there.

10305045,0,t3_5nj89c,Oh the irony of someone who worked in a pediatric sleep clinic with a child with sleep problems....J is  weeks so his circadian rhythms are just coming online I know. BUT! We cannot for the life of us put him down drowsy but awake  maybe  of the time it works and we want to transfer him to his crib because hes too long for the rock and play. This is typically what happens  Put down drowsy but awake cries or wakes up more Put down awake before nap period cries when tired and needs to be rocked for soothingLet fall asleep on shoulder wakes up after transfer or if he doesnt he sleeps  minutesObviously hes super cranky if he misses his naps and sleeps more poorly at night so weve typically been letting him fall asleep on us and trying to transfer. HELP! We use a swaddle at night and for naps he doesnt take a pacifier and he really seems to need to be rocked back to sleep  there is no selfsoothing after a few minutes only intensifying screaming.   ,InfertilityBabies,dcc4rph,2,t5_2vy6k

10382352,0,t1_dckh0ay,I think most of us here would say not to waste too much time with an OB once you hit fertility interventions. Its a bit like taking a Tesla to the mechanic down the street  they can probably rotate your tires but theres a lot of specialized stuff they just arent equipped to handle. Lots of OBs hand out Clomid like candy more often to women but not exclusively  and although sometimes its all thats needed its kind of the extent of their toolbox.

10383142,0,t3_5op7xt,I discovered by chance a few days ago that my baby girl has a congenital disorder.  Ive been completely obsessed about it ever since. She has whats called a unilateral preauricular sinus which is a tiny pin hole on her left ear. I had always wondered what it was looks like an enlarged pore or an earring hole and by chance I was surfing Facebook and IFLScience had an article about them. Apparently they can be either hereditary but its genetically dominant so thats not how she got it since neither parent has one or a developmental defect that happened in the th week. Of course now Im beating myself up for whatever I did that week that caused her ear to not fully form correctly.They seem somewhat common so logically I know I shouldnt be too worried but they are correlated with hearing loss and kidney issues so how can I not be?!!

10416899,0,t1_dcoqw4f,I agree completely! Thats why I was wondering if something was changing! This came up earlier with a friend whos a single mom who would be coming in from out of town. The solution was that my husband would watch her daughter. Easy enough though shes let her ex have the kiddo for the weekend. The newest situation came from my friend with  sets of twins. For her the issue is that her husband doesnt like to watch all  by himself. I like kids but I think Im drawing the line based on if the kids need their own seats or are in arms. When theyre tiny no big deal but when you need to start feeding them and entertaining them it becomes a different thing. Thanks for making me feel like Im not losing my mind!

10465984,0,t1_dcucbt1,So heres my thoughts on stuff like this for what its worth as someone who has a fetus with alleged kidney issues that will get checked out again in March.First of all Its hard to measure something tiny and moving. One little click and they accidentally measure something as too bigtoo small and then when they measure weeks later it seems off in comparison.Second of all Ultrasound machines have come a long way. They detect things that couldnt be seen  years ago. Sometimes I feel like they detect TOO much and just cause people to worry. My friend just went through this. Baby had a hole in her heart at  week ultrasound she spent weeks thinking the worst went back last week hole is completely closed. No doubt many years ago that hole wouldnt have even been seen and she never would have had to deal with that worry.Third of all Upon birth my daughter was in all the normal percentiles and then became such a tiny peanut that she dropped off the growth charts. Completely off. There was much hand wringing from all the doctors. They WERE actually telling me to worry. Granted she was outside the womb while this was happening so perhaps more reassuring since I was seeing her in the flesh but I had a  year old who weighed  pounds thats like a normal  month year old. Now shes  and a normal heightweight for her age. Fetuses grow and develop at different rates just like people who are already born and those percentiles are seriously the most annoying thing. A fetus can certainly change in size throughout the pregnancy. Maybe babys abs filled out first and now baby is on their way to becoming long and lean. I know its hard not to worry but try to take some comfort. My MFM doc told me the same thing not to worry about the kidney issue and so Im trying not to. I hope the follow up ultrasound can put your fears to rest!,InfertilityBabies,dcufcax,5,t5_2vy6k

Someone more wellversed in pregnancy is going to be a lot more helpful than an ER doctor who will essentially tell you its a threatened miscarriage wand you to see if they see anything and they could be wrong if they dont see anything and send you on your way.Heres my post from about a week ago and all the encouraging and reassuring comments.  I hope they help you too  ,InfertilityBabies,ddz8k8j,3,t5_2vy6k

10871395,0,t1_de18hax,gtIt helps me be more aware of how others feel about these terms and complicated feelings around pregnancy in general.Yes  and at the end of the day that is going to be the main goal of this thread. It doesnt seem like we are at a clear consensus as a sub as to whether or not the term should stop being used but now everyone is aware some members are feeling hurt and those hurt members can know that most of the people using it didnt mean to hurt them.,InfertilityBabies,de1b255,1,t5_2vy6k
10898529,0,t3_5vqr2r,You know Im not sure! Automod is on a schedule to post it every morning so something must have hiccuped. Ill check to make sure its still configured to post and nothing has changed.Edit Checked the automod sub and the mods of loseit have also posted that autmod skipped their scheduled threads as well. Unfortunately if this happens and someone notices its late they are free to start one of their own.,InfertilityBabies,de43toe,2,t5_2vy6k

10902867,0,t3_5vqr28,Wait noooooo! Ok so a few wks ago I was pissed off abt this snotty pumpin mamas lunch at work.It was today. Did not attend. But my email account apparently did. They sat around a table in our courtyard and literally pumped together. In public! And took pics!!! Then emailed each other recaps. Who knew it would be so much fun sitting around making milk together!?My jaw is on the floor. WHO DOES THAT??!? The Prejokes I made dont even live up to the greatness this event achieved. Maybe I will never understand other moms.,InfertilityBabies,de4jxc3,6,t5_2vy6k

As a fellow nurse please modify the first name at the very least  patients post our info all over the place and Ive been Facebook contactedprior to changing my name on fb by random people who read about me on some forum or another.

10928370,0,t1_de6ttba, was also untrue for us. We asked for the genders but didnt get to pick order. Clinic picks the order based on grade even though PGS ought to trump grading but thats how they do it,InfertilityBabies,de76nra,1,t5_2vy6k
10931709,0,t1_de7c2ks,I am no stranger to bots having scripted a few myself back in the day for IRC and Tradewars.Im not objecting to the fact that it is a bot.

It makes us all nauseous...,InfertilityBabies,de7j1oc,1,t5_2vy6k
10954922,0,t1_de9wtte,Agreed with KT  the hospital nursery nurse actually recommended we have them sleep together at first which I know is against official American pediatric recommendations. But we have them both sleeping on the top level of a pack n play right now. We dont have the twin attachment theyre just in the raised bassinet level. How are you feeling by now physically? I hope the recovery isnt too rough.,InfertilityBabies,de9x7no,1,t5_2vy6k
10964986,0,t3_5whwmx,You arent a dick. To me because of my loss history viability day will be the day my baby is delivered alive and breathing and not a victim of a cord accident.  You are entitled to feel how you feel. You dont have to celebrate if you dont want to.  You can celebrate if you do. For me if I ever make it past the first trimester any person who says viability day!!! Will get punched in the face. ,InfertilityBabies,deaylwl,3,t5_2vy6k

10998803,0,t1_dee00c2,Thanks for the pep talk! Yep if I had to pick any day and age from all of history up to now to give birth Id definitely choose now! My mother and I would have not survived my own birth if Id been born just a few decades earlier but thanks to modern medicine were both here today thanks to modern medicine I was able to conceive this child and thanks to modern medicine my worries are just my recovery might be so much harder and not I might die. Lets play the waiting game for just a little while longer and see where we end up.,InfertilityBabies,deeoj0d,2,t5_2vy6k
11000557,0,t3_5x2mn3,We had some crazy storms here last night and lost power. It caused the battery back up on my work computer to trigger so it was beeping incessantly. Apparently I woke up confused and scared my husband who thought I was having a hypoglycemic episode. Cue a am freakout from him and me waking up with no idea what was going on.

11027526,0,t3_5xgg3y,She did it again guys..another restful night with two wake ups and  nonconsecutive hours of sleep! Todays bad news is that the abrasion on my nipple for sure escalated into a minor case of mastitis yesterday. I woke up from a nap feeling chilly and achy and that breast HURT. Spiked a low grade fever a couple of hours later. Luckily my doc was happy to call in antibiotics over the phone based on my symptoms and Im already feeling a little better after three doses. Hopefully Ill finally be healed up soon. ,InfertilityBabies,dehy181,2,t5_2vy6k

Its beautiful how much they change week to week! Hope it gets easier from here on out for you!,InfertilityBabies,depzgkw,1,t5_2vy6k
11101297,0,t1_depkgn6,Oh my god you are a saint.  If shes there long enough that shes NAPPING during her visits!  GOOD GRIEF.  Most people have already offered excellent suggestions but Ill throw out another version  Decide what you can give  once a week for x hours twice a week for Y hours each whatever. Impress upon your husband that this is what you can give and if he wants to give her more then its his responsibility to accommodate that but it also means that time is a real break for you.  And never compromise on the safety of your babies!  Good luck with everything!Is it worth point out that in his culture the elderly are treated one way but in your culture the that your expectations are much much less  and while you want to be sensitive to his expectations that isnt YOUR culture and at this exact moment in time you can only bend to his culture so much without breaking?,InfertilityBabies,deqbm3d,2,t5_2vy6k

11203676,0,t1_df1u9vi,I am  today! My RE does the us at  weeks. I wish it were sooner but at least at that point itll be a little more conclusive. Last time I was pregnant we did one early cuz I had weird pains on one side. We did it at  I think and there was no heartbeat because it was too early but they also said that the embryos were smaller than they should be and were a little concerned. It was awful and not seeing the heartbeat even tho we expected to probably not see it made the whole thing super anxietyinducing. The pregnancy ended up a missed miscarriage So doing it at  weeks although I hate waiting will be good for me because I know itll be a lot more conclusive either way. Im so happy for you that everything looked great! Thats a huge milestone!! When is your next one?,InfertilityBabies,df1x7lv,1,t5_2vy6k
