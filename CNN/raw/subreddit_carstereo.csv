4768596,0,t3_3ez5fc,Im pretty sure the wires youre seeing are the wires TO your head unit. Youre missing al of the wires that go back to the speakers from the head unit.It looks to me like you had an aftermarket radio in there? Sometimes they do a really bad job of splicing stuff and your harnesses can be pulled back in behind the dash. Try fishing around back there for any unused plugs or better yet RCA connectors often new radios use RCA but factory wiring never does so rather than doing it the nice way and using a harness adapter they splice right into your harness which is a pain in the tuckus. anecdote I once pulled about ft of tangled up wiring from behind my dash because of an aftermarket instal gone bad. Had to find a new sock wiring harness because they cut the wires so close to the connector I couldnt solder it back together. You have no idea how hard it is to find a wiring harness for a  Saab.footnote. in my experience.TLDR only your head unit power wires are showing. Youre missing the ones running to your speakers. Either go fishing or pull your dash and find them or lay new wires.,carstereo,ctvmigv,1,t5_2sx1d
