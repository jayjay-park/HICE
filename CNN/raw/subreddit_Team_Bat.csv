10252095,0,t1_dc5w4aj,I still cant decide...The last few months Ive been doing little to no exercise and eating pretty much whatever I feel like. So any changes seem impossible. But I was doing quite well before that so i just need to get back into that mindset. I guess Im not sure if i should start small or try to do what I was doing before  cal a day and run  times a week.I think Ill just start off with calories and then add running in a week or so. I definitely dont think your goal is small but I guess were all in a different position  good luck! ,Team_Bat,dc64qgn,4,t5_3i6xb

10277896,0,t3_5mekoa,This is my first challenge ever. I was able to get down to  in  for my wedding and I felt better than I had in forever. I did it mostly through diet and abstaining from beer. Of course I gained it all back because... reasons... and beer. I told myself Id start going to the gym in the new year and due to weird weather and a hectic work schedule I teach due to that weather I havent gone once. Im hoping this challenge will help with motivation and accountability! My MFP username is saralw! ,Team_Bat,dc920ac,3,t5_3i6xb

10623043,0,t3_5rzfx1,I am doing great on a related goal but horrible on this challenges goal. I need to lose about  lbs going from  to  or so on a  frame and thought the challenge would start me right. My initial plan was to jump start this and go from  to   a challenge but not undoable.But then I noticed the  hour fitness that opened up a  minute drive from my home. Ive spent the last  months lifting pretty seriously but have plateaued because I simply ran out of weights. Ive joined the gym just at the start of the challenge  and havent looked back.Ive been training hard and eating  generally  clean Ive been at the gym  days a week plus running  x a week. As a result my weight has bounced between  and  during the challenge period. This morning I was    pounds from my initial goal. Normally Id be pissed at myself but I am happier than ever as I have been pushing some serious weights around. I also think I am losing fat and gaining muscle. I figure I have put on a pound to two pounds of muscle in January and dropped  pounds of fat my pants fit better.Some personal records this JanuaryBench press previously did floor presses with  lb. dumbbells just did  at  lb. barbell bench press.Deadlift previously did  at  lbs due to back injury years ago just did   at  lbs. and  at !.Cardio previously I ran  miles  times a week in the  minute range on hills finished hot chocolate  k at  mile average xx for the whole . miles! two weeks ago. In short I will not hit my initial but I have a serious foundation in health. This next challenge I intend to build on it and get my eating down to a science. Ideally I will hit  by my birthday in the late summer. Best of luck to you all....,Team_Bat,ddbopjs,1,t5_3i6xb
