3703261,0,t3_32t8cc,I used to live there and apart from it being as expensive as my current mortgage it was great. I never had any issues. I really liked having a garbage chute so I didnt have to actually take it to a dumpster. I really liked the underground parking. The workout room was fairly decent for a quick workout in the morning. I never used the pool though. It was the nicest apartment building I ever lived in but I make considerably less than a physician so it just became an issue for me while trying to save money for a house. If you have any more specific questions feel free to let me know. TLDR It was really nice but very expensive.,rochestermn,cqeea85,2,t5_2rqfl

However  between the Twin Cities and Rochester has a huge amount of cops patrolling it... but everyone goes at least  usually and there are groups that will go . Ive gotten pulled over with a warning for coming down a hill on the way back from the twin cities at  mph alone once he was waiting at the bottom. Just be smart,rochestermn,cv714w7,1,t5_2rqfl

Thanks a ton for all the rest of your answers though thats really helpful.

8605750,0,t1_d6deku1,You cant get real kobe beef in the US. If you did since it costs over lb in Japan where it cant be exported you would need to pay hundreds more to obtain it. This ridiculous claim that people are serving kobe beef hit its pinnacle when Burger King allegedly make Kobe beef burgers at their stores its no less absurd than someone else selling it though. Wagyu beef is basically a buzzword people are adding to their advertisements to make money like antibiotic free chicken. Considered nobody has ever used antibiotics on chicken its a huge advertising scam. Dont fall for that bs about Wagyu beef either no different than American strains of cattle. The preparation is really what you should be paying for because you can buy a  oz prime ny strip at the grocery store for .,rochestermn,d6hbalh,0,t5_2rqfl
