6897056,0,t1_d0xyk6e,That is correct as stated above we agreed on a maximum of  positions for each person therefore we gave the Fire Type Gym back to uThatOneGirlBehindYou since she has been showing interest in that position from the beginning and that gym was the last you registered for Our goal in the end is to have a max of  Gym leader position and  BackUp position per person. Thanks for understanding.,RedditIndigoLeague,d0y3lnz,1,t5_3ccnj
