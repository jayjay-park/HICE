3384268,0,t3_2yxn3e,I suspect that asking pirates advice on how to avoid being pirated is similar to asking a lawyer for advice so you dont have to use a lawyer.But who am I to speculate? Ive never pirated anyone. Maybe some of them prefer a good challenge over a good take...,ElitePirates,cpe16yx,2,t5_35g3x

3552218,0,t1_cpx683t,There should be. At least it gives a little amount of benefits even if the pirating is not successfull. Like I said problem is that there are too many ways to avoid piracy and pirates dont have enough tools to put pressure in the pirating.Problem also is that IF and I say if loud IF Frontier is willing to buff piracy one day what seems quite like not happening right now normal people are going to startout crying beacous there will be even more pirates but thoes guys just seem to forget that in Elite Dangerous there is the word Dangerous... ,ElitePirates,cpx6cv3,2,t5_35g3x
3577237,0,t1_cpzzsad,Exactly. Im not doing anything in elite for in game credits. I see credits as a bonus. But as soon as I find something boringnot worth my time I move on to something else. Hence the reason why I mostly do piracy. And the most rewarding part about it is the player interaction and the immersion it gives. When pirating youre basically waiting for a target to show up. Then engage in an interdiction. You win it and make your demands clear. Your target proceeds to boost away. Its time to make that trader know why he should have stopped. Taking down those thrusters with precision. Youve finally got him. He then proceeds to send a message saying goodbye before disappearing. That scenario to me is pretty game breaking. All the immersion is lost in the blink of an eye. My achievement suddenly had no impact on anything. It is like it never happened. The only trace of the event is my ship integrity repair bill and ammo cost. Combat loggers are definitely ruining the experience for a large part of the player base and should be banned without a warning. ,ElitePirates,cq0179g,4,t5_35g3x

3691114,0,t1_cqczylt,Thanks.  Ill have a look around to see where is hot.  I dont mind getting caught or destroyed by player BHs.  Itll add some excitement.  RES grinding stopped being fun once I got a Vulture so its time for the PVP challenge.,ElitePirates,cqd0emd,1,t5_35g3x

4548728,0,t1_csuu5tp,Why dont you kill them? I interdicted someone today a type . Sent him a comms telling him to stop his ship and prepare for cargo scan if he runs he dies. Obviously he tries to run but I never understand why. I dont want all the cargo or to kill them but I feel if I give them fair warning then true to my Pirate ways I will kill them. Dont see anything wrong with that. If you play in Open in an MMO they are the risks. Same goes for me and being hunted for the increasing bounty on my head. All part of the fun.,ElitePirates,ct3zp9c,1,t5_35g3x

9985137,0,t1_db8ytd3,You were a bit too close with the missiles so they couldnt arm.What I mean is you switched from shooting the power plant with your lasers to shooting the drives with your missiles. Why use the missiles at all?Nice video btw ,ElitePirates,db93ayi,1,t5_35g3x

10875717,0,t3_5vfp5q,gt Im not entirely sold on the triple laser beams with heat ventHeat vent doesnt work while silent running and doesnt work that well at all.gt Still I wonder if theres something better than the heat vent beams...Scramble Spectrum will cause random malfunctions potentially disabling a key system. Even the Emissive effect works better for piracy because at the very least their silent runningheat sink popping wouldnt make you lose target lock. This is in regards to pulses in place of beams.gt  My reasoning for triple beams is that I want to hit them as hard as possible in between chaff intervals and the Clipper hardpoints dont really allow for fixed weapons anyway. One of your Class  hardpoints should be fixed. The other two can track towards it when not under the effects of chaff.gt Going shieldless isnt a big issue either in that sense.This really dont help at all for piracy.gt And since Im going to be silentrunning I went with a low emissions power plant and clean grade thrusters. Paired with a single heat sink module I should be able to take my loot into any starport without issue no matter the legality my cargo or what my wanted status is.You dont need to do any of that. Simply popping a heat sink has the same effect as silent running and I smuggle in a Grade  Overcharged PowerplantDirty Drive Imperial Cutter every day.,ElitePirates,de1r3zs,1,t5_35g3x
