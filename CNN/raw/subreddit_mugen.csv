520595,0,t1_cfyzaox,Well to be technical about it all creating a stage with all the stuff that goes into it is considered having a little coding knowledge on hand. I was in the Beats of Rage scene about  years prior to the mugen scene and Ive been dealing with the mugen engine for about  years now. It wasnt until  or  years back when I finally got involved into creating stages using the knowledge I gained while working with the BoR Engine. I would love to learn the internal workings of the engine beyond what is already there to at least assist the elecbyte team in making it better accessible.The majority of what I make is usually from stuff that has not been done yet. A LOT of retro stuff that has yet to see the light of day was eventually made possible by me. An example of this is the main street from Urban Champion on NES. Nobody made a stage for it despite someone created the guy you play with. As of current I think Ive done somewhere close to or over  stages. With the upside of them being very lightweight in terms of file size.Most of my stages are done from the games I used to play over  years ago and still play them now thanks to emulation. There are only two stages that I worked on from the ground up. One of them is called The Zero Void. And the other is the Salty Bet Casino stage. Using the Casino stage from Ring of Destruction Slammasters  as a template I managed to build the rest of it by hand. It took a good week to finish it.If you have noticed there are a number of stages that give you the MvC style superjump ability much like in the MvC or Versus style games. That is actually a due process of how high you edit the top half of the stage. Depending on the height of the backdrop you use you can make it to where the camera can amp will pan upwards when doing a hardhigh jump. Or an aerial raveair combo. There is no real coding required to do that but you MUST do two things before making it Super Jump ready . You must physically edit the layer in something like Photoshop or The Gimp to extend the top part of the image. Go as high as you want but within reason characters who can double jump on top of super jump combos that continually keep going upwards. moves that fall from the sky etc... And  you must adjust the boundhigh of stage in said stages .def file. It is normally located around the top part of it when you open it. You will have to often toy around with this as it is never perfect.,mugen,cfzg2gr,3,t5_2siel

5967326,0,t1_cy0qhin,Thats good. I have some experience in coding shown from my other sites I go to if you need further help ask and if I have the time I might help. Its possible to add many things in MUGEN like homing attacks cutscenes at FPS and stat buffsdebuffs. Its very versatile for an engine made in the s. It is being known as crazy and broken because of the cheapie war. When you search that up you might realise its about many creators most of them Japanese though competing to see who can create the cheapestmost overpowered character. Usually its Orochi or Ronald McDonald but OCs Sanders stickmen and Pokmon are contenders for cheapest characters in the nuke category least cheap. The most cheap however is very dangerous and can wreck everything near you that is an electrical appliance including the computer itself. Good thing is none are public. But in any case MUGEN is one of the best if not THE best freeware fighting game engines one can ever see in the near future and maybe the far future too.,mugen,cy1uj3v,1,t5_2siel

9148112,0,t1_d8b7dn1,Oh oops. There is indeed a joystick option there. My bad. Amending my original comment.,mugen,d8bl8rg,1,t5_2siel
9274821,0,t3_57758q,i doubt it. mugen has been pretty dead for awhile even a decade ago it seemed like it was dying off  i think miles is too new but i wish you luck.,mugen,d8rne73,1,t5_2siel
