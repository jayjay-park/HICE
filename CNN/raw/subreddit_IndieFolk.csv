4810338,0,t3_3gpwll,This is one of my favorites. Although I dont see how this would convert Jack haters. It has his mellow flow finger strumming whispery voice and feelgoodooziness all over it.If you want to show people a different side of JJ sample some of his covers. I dont know how many he does nowadays but there have been a bunch of bootleg recordings of his early shows floating around for years where he does some fantastic covers. Buffet Marley Sublime. Some of my favorites are Frankie and Johnny Rocky Raccoon BadfishBoss DJ. All still have his signature Jack sound but it may strike a chord of familiarity with nonfans and open them up a bit.,IndieFolk,cu0vske,3,t5_2srge
