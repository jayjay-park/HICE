1341886,0,t1_cikfgg8,I dont think this is quite rightat least its certainly not to scale. Heres an interview with the photographer about the shot and heres a widerangle view of the same landscape. From the interviewgtHeres a short summary about the making of the photo. It was made at dawn when the warm light of the morning sun was illuminating a huge red sand dune dotted with white grasses while the white floor of the clay pan was still in shade. It looks blue because it reflects the color of the sky above. Because of the contrast between the shady foreground and the sunlit background I used a twostop graduated filter which reduced the contrast. The perfect moment came when the sun reached all the way down to the bottom of the sand dune just before it reached the desert floor. I used a long telephoto lens and stopped it all the way down to compress the perspective.,confusing_perspective,cikkt6l,8,t5_32csr

1501501,0,t1_cj4evex,Hmm I think its fine to be annoyed by them I wished more people were  that way theyd eventually be filtered out. Problem is using reddit as an example again regurgitated jokes are rewarded with karma which just causes people to keep doing them. I wish people would start downvoting all the shit  it would make me so much happier.,confusing_perspective,cj4hjes,1,t5_32csr

10052595,0,t1_db8ml0n,Seeing it as a third leg makes sense with the lighting coming from the window by the vase and the darker shade at the top of the vase by the end of her skirt makes it seem like the its coming out of the skirt. It takes a while but if I imagine the top of the vase as a bowl like I did before I can see the  legged lady again.,confusing_perspective,dbhvmt7,0,t5_32csr
