1719839,0,t3_2e4a3d,You need a lot of things to line up for the best run. Just as an idea the record for bard score runs right now is k something and Id estimate the theoretical max to be like kk which would not only require perfect play but luck as well to get all the best gearshrinesspellsscrolls etc. You can get k gold alone if you can manage to kill a giant monster with a jeweled dagger while wearing crown of greed with x multiplier from shrine of rhythm active and have it drop gold instead of the purple scroll  base gold      . And then theres getting purple scrolls as well to break all the gold walls in shops and arena rooms. Bomb spell is always nice. Lots of bomb drops. Finding the rooms that are filled with black skeletons are always nice on a score run as well lol.So yea theres def. tons more room for the scores to get higher especially on cadence.Also pretty sure jeweled dagger does not work on bosses.,necrodancer,cjvy694,1,t5_2yq2c

The missing beat of the rhythm shrine causes no enemies to move while this character is only thing that doesnt move on that missing beat.

3799694,0,t1_cqp69j8,I have been trying to diversify my game purchasing habits for a while now but the recent drama definitely precipitated me being more active about it. I guess Im just not really a fan of how thoroughly integrated with Steam my gaming experience has become. I do recognize the fact that it is a great platform for exposure without which Necrodancer might have not been possible but I guess I just do not like it being that massive a player and having that much control. I find it quite disconcerting how much of an impact Valves decisions can have across the entire medium. So I would like to diversify. Im not going to cut out steam and purchases on it completely but if I can find an alternative I will most likely purchase that. For example I am planning on getting both Pillars of Eternity and the Witcher  from GoG. I also really like their DRMfree stance and the fact that their games arent integrated into a client. ,necrodancer,cqpe7yt,1,t5_2yq2c

5224901,0,t3_3mkm0o,NVM did Dove after  failed attempts  of which died in zone . I also got my first replay that didnt get broken by bat rng. Yay! It was really just Zone  giving me issues. The skeleton swarms on  in cramped corridors really suck. But on my third attempt after buying obsidian armor from a  blood shop getting an early luminous torch really super helpful getting a potion and a  shield scroll   freeze spell pickups she was a piece of cake. Zone  was ridiculously watered down and the fact that you dont have to deal with suicide bombers warlock teleportation ooze and blademaster shenanigans really helped. And in zone  and  the you dont have to deal with the skeleton shields either.Personally I think the miners cap is an iffy item on Dove because sometimes I want open space and other times I want to choose which walls get broken.So why is it ok to drop beats on Dorian? Is it because of the ring of might and the plate armor make gold less valuable since armor isnt a problem and weapons get augmented with the ring?,necrodancer,cvfsijo,1,t5_2yq2c

10378122,0,t1_dck7h6p,Its generally better to get a good weapon from the boss before getting the purple chests.Weapons better than a dagger are basically any weapon that is obsidian or titatium. A base rapier or a cat of nine tails is better as well. A whip is one of the worst weapons and should be avoided.The reason is that you can throw a dagger letting you kill some bosses more quickybut the damage that titaniumobsidium gives you is better than a  damage dagger. A rapiercat lets you attack and move at the same time increasing speed. A whip is slow as you start hitting everything around you instead of rushing to the exit.,necrodancer,dckf9ug,3,t5_2yq2c

Multiply that by  due to Karate Gi War Drum and Gigantism and you get  damage. Damage boosts add  damage due to risk charm plus  damage due to strength charm plus the ring torch and shovel which give you  more damage add the boots of pain  damage and that leaves you with a  damage bonus so now you have  damage. Now multiply by  due to glass jaw and you get  damage.If you replace boots of pain with boots of strength you get an  damage bonus so youre left with  damage multiplied by  would be .EDIT Forgot about War Drum.EDIT  Forgot about Gigantism.EDIT  Math fixEDIT  I think everything is correct now.EDIT  Ive given up on math now.,necrodancer,derdfwd,4,t5_2yq2c
