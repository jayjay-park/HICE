11493320,0,t3_62styz,The extended versions of Making Flippy Floppy Girlfriend is Better Slippery People I Get WildWild Gravity and Moon Rocks are the standard versions for CD and the original cassette releases. Which leads me to believe that the tracks were not extended but truncated for the vinyl release to fit the limitations of the medium namely how much music you can fit on one.Theres also a  version of Making Flippy Floppy which I wasnt aware of until now.,talkingheads,dfyrm6m,3,t5_2s4t7
