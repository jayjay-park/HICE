2061873,0,t1_cl1nyxk,I usually go by the stats. If Im within .k of the damage Ill feel pretty good about the fight. Thing with Doomsday is to not let him drain your health too hard. Id suggest to run that fight with whoever you have with the most health in the first two slots and your heaviest hitter in the third. Dont let anyone get under about  health if you can keep switching out between your st  cards then supermove the hell outta him with . Power drainers will also buy you time.Id say you want at least e for that battle.  At least for your lead card. Battle  is your best grind spot for cash until you can consistently do bb. Challenges are also great to farm if youre on Android and can do the reset. Gives you the potential to elite bronze  silver and the challenge card for free. And if its one that hands out a bonus silver even better. E that sucker then start selling duplicates.

2735574,0,t1_cnf0ovn,Id try to go for two balanced teams myself to get the best shot at winning the most battles Given those six Id split ABB amp Raven your two best and AnimHQ amp Bats spread the passive boosts. From there Id say ABB is a little stronger to start and youll want the power gen to keep his passive boosts going so put AnimHQ with him and give Raven the extra damage boost from Batman. Then youve got RWW amp DD  with RWW being the weaker of the two and also generating a little power on her own even if its just a little anymore put her with Raven amp Batman on the more damageless power boost side and slot DD in with ABB amp AnimHQ. This also splits the two with their own regenerating abilities Raven amp DD onto different teams and since one of your two strongest Raven has her own selfhealing of sorts this also keeps the other ABB on the other team with AnimHQ the Team Healer.I think those two teams should be pretty solid. Otherwise if youre just looking to max one team go ABBRavenAnimHQ  the two best with the best support. Leaving DD with Bats Prime big damage boost means hell be KOing a lot of fools and keeping himself healed with RWW as backup isnt actually too bad either but I think the first pair is better balanced overall.,InjusticeMobile,cnf0tml,3,t5_2ymzc

My grandmother used to slap me with a spoon when I would cheat at a card game.Morally I dont think theres a difference in what you exploit to get ahead. You can blame crappy code on WB but I can assure you their code is relatively solid. People who want to cheat will always find a way.I wish WB would buckle down a little more on some of them but honestly it has very little impact on my experience. Even as fairly heavy MP user my team is better than most hackers because the AI in this plays like my year old nephew and even the most OP and hacky of teams can be defeated by a much weaker team. Ill never hit  but Im quite content with top . Hell Im pretty okay with top . If  got a real batmobile? Then I might be against cheating. But really its zeros and ones. Enjoy the extra ones you get.If you want to make it a cakewalk in single player youre only cheating yourself because just like there will always be people who cheat there will always be people who pay  for coins and there will always be people who grind for hours on end for coins.Hopefully the cheaters get bored faster than those of us who actually play the game as it was meant and it gets better but as long as they arent really affecting me Ill leave GodAllahYawehZeusCthuluAnubis to the judgement.

It was rather OP especially with the batmobile area effect super. Therefore the dev made the balancing change that no characters can start the match with  bars of power. The same is true if you run BG with AOB AOB is capped at  bars of power at the start. For reference AOB is the only one affected by this rule AKB has something similar but he technically doesnt start the match with the power and bypass the  bars of power check.To answer your question you can have BG whose passive is give every teammate a bar of power at the start  and have Ras equipped on BG or her teammate to have  bars of power on a character.,InjusticeMobile,d08vbww,2,t5_2ymzc

10669023,0,t1_ddgce7p,well if you do the math  minutes to recharge a team of  cards that can together beat BB. which means you will need roughly an hour an  minutes to beat it once. However once you can solo BB with  separate cards you double your income in less than half the time.    SO focusing ONLY on  BB your progression should be a single team that can beat itwith geargt card that can solo itwith geargt replace that solo card so you have a team that can beat BB with gear.

11337430,0,t3_61t8pj,Google is your friend friendCrit Immunity Batsuit icon Batman will be immune to CRIT damage.Drain Immunity Lightning target Immunity to power drain effects including those from Ras Al Ghuls Scimitar.SP Damage Buff Batarang Increases the base damage of his SP by . diminishes to . at max damage.Crit Damage Buff W target Batman does  more damage on Crit attacks.Power Added Batman and Lightning Gives Batman  bars of power instantly. Because he technically doesnt start the match with two bars instead generating them immediately after the match starts it bypasses the bar cap giving him access to a Super at the start of the match if equipped with Ras Al Ghuls Scimitar or while teamed with BatgirlPrime. Militarized Batmobile will further boost his power and can allow him to finish off the opponent quicker.DOT Immunity Cross Batman is immune to Damage over Time. He is virtually immune to characters that are known to deal DamageOvertime on their specials both  and  in this case. This is a strong defense against characters that deals heavy damage over time such as ScorpionMortal Kombat X and The JokerArkham Origins. It will not however work against Radiation.,InjusticeMobile,dfh2th5,6,t5_2ymzc

11667167,0,t1_dgh13d5,I just came up against DOJ batman with full LOA set. Tagged in Rebirth Raven when he was about a bar and a half of power. She tagged in with a power of about half a bar. Soon as the previous fighter tagged out DOJ got a power gain taking him to about .. bars which she then promptly drained upon tagin to get herself to about . bars and DOJ batman was left with zero. Couple hits and she was at full power for the supermove. I think she is protected against LOA infact I think LOA fullset backfires against her giving her more power.,InjusticeMobile,dgihls8,1,t5_2ymzc
