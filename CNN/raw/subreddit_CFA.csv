So start with interesting subjects alternate investments equity fixed income etc as opposed to jumping into quantethicsaccounting. Save those for last or sprinkle them in between.Take notes for the chapters and write down formulas as well.

6784766,0,t1_d0l8y4a,Again as I mentioned it is feasible to get through all the exams in  years but it is not something most people do. It took me just over  years to become a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries and at the time I became I fellow only  or so people had become fellows faster than me since . What most people overlook in my experience is the amount of work it takes to prepare for exams even the lower exams. Very few students have the drive to crank out  exams a year let alone actually pass all . In my experience interacting with students at my company the average student passes one exam a year. They also slow down to a crawl when they hit the FAP and FSA modules as those are mostly selfdriven. It may be different in the UK but youll have a damn hard time finding fellows that completed the process in  years.I didnt stay with the career too long but when I left I was making about k including bonus after about . years of experience. At least where I worked there were quite a few making over k and they were heavily involved in the actuarial work. Sure they werent monkeying around in Excel entering claim lag data into spreadsheets but they had a wealth of knowledge and would drive client strategy. Theyd work on the difficult problems and let the younger actuaries do the grunt work.The quant route absolutely leads to more mathematically challenging work but that is a completely different world than the actuarial world. The level of technical ability required to excel in that world aside from the educational pedigree is severely lacking in the actuarial world although there are some very technical PampC and Reinsurance actuaries in my experience.,CFA,d0lc8e9,1,t5_2rzsx

10500601,0,t3_5qd2so,If you have Kaplan its not too hard to read all of the material do practice questions on each section then reread again. And its not just reading...you need to focus on understanding the material and why the formulas are the way they are. If you can understand what a formula is trying to accomplish or measure it makes it much easier to remember the formula itself. So many people seem to look for the easy way or shortcut to passing but I say why not go balls to the walls and actually learn the stuff.,CFA,dcycr7x,1,t5_2rzsx

10581399,0,t3_5ri22w,Never done a Schweser mock but I used the qbank and found the questions to hardly be similar to those on the actual exam. If youre scoring gt on the CFA exams youre likely to pass. You should be scoring higher than  for topic tests just cuz you usually take them right after crushing the topic so its fresh in ur mind. Id try and get topic tests scores higher redo some EoC questions then mock and determine which sections you should focus on from there. Youre way ahead of the game for l ,CFA,dd7e1b8,2,t5_2rzsx

10615778,0,t3_5ro8kn,I recently found myself in a similar situation with a company. They hire recent college grads primarily. They asked for the  names after they hired me I called them the next day and said it wasnt going to work out. I dont know much about Investors Group but it already sounds a lot like the business model of this other company.They claim an open architecture access to a multitude of products from many companies which may be technically true but then I find out that they have quotas for you to sell their own products or else you lose your benefits. If you dont bring in a certain amount of business within the first couple months youre let go. But they keep your contacts. And the book of business is theirs. If this sounds like Investors Group run the other way. The list of contacts should make you nervous. But think about it they get free contacts without having any skin in the game.However keep in mind that wherever you go as an advisor or wealth manager you will probably have to build your own book. Its probably the toughest part of the job but its how you make way more money than bank advisors. So if you find yourself in some sort of training program or work as a bank advisor for a while you can use that time to network and build some client acquisition strategies. ,CFA,ddaxr00,1,t5_2rzsx

11300914,0,t1_dfcr5e4,First I use the t table in the CFA.  To be specific I use the one from the online app.  So if I were you that is where I would go for these details.  On the other hand the exam will not make you guess for this.  So long as you read the question properly you should be able to select the correct critical value.. would be the critical value for a single tail test if we were looking at df.  However for a two tailed test with the same degrees of freedom the critical value is .As a previous poster stated when you dont have the exact df in the list you round the the closest one.  ,CFA,dfcxx33,2,t5_2rzsx

You said the total amount of the cash flows adds up to something other than what your four cash flows adds to.  So is it possible there is more info?Anyway the way I would get the future value after being given a list of different cash flows and one discount rate is a two step process.Step Use the cash flow function on my calculator to get the present value.Cf kCf kCf kCf kI Second function NPVPresent value is .kStep Then find fvPv .I N Gives you fv  .kAnyway that is how I would solve this based on the in you have given.Since the answers are different Im sure there is missing data.,CFA,dgmc1jb,2,t5_2rzsx
