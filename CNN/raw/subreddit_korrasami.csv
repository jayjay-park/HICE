I also dont see Makorra happening by the end either I think its obvious that their relationship is over. I would love it if Korrasami happened but I think the creators want to leave that question openended for the fans to decide on their own. Will she pick Mako Asami or someone else? I think they want us to decide.

Either ways it if happens its a winwin. If it doesnt happen well I dunno depends how it plays out. I can almost imagine everybody who was against it go all Ha! I told you it will never happen!

2581212,0,t1_cmvhrxs,Makes a lot of sense yes. I never really gave it much thought but it would make a lot of sense for you to be confused or not even realize you can date people of your own gender  because nobody is teaching that stuff as anything more then some kind of abnormality almost all moviescartoons you watched since you were a child are about hetero couples and parents further reinforce this heteronormativity thing by not telling you about the existence of homosexuality. I mean they are not obligated to buy figures it would make lives of a lot of children easier.Yeah I remember one brief talk my mom gave me when I was a kid At some point guys become interested in girls and girls into guys. I didnt even ask if it can happen between two people of the same gender. Its easy when it doesnt affect you right?Its so easy to form negative opinions and incorrect assumptions about your life style when nobody is teaching those things in school and when its not represented in media as anything more then a joke. Especially if you grow up in a conservative environment like mine where they fcking banned gay marriage.It leads me to a conclusion that all those statements about Korra being unrealistic are pure bullshit obviously. You just need to use your head. Sadly most people dont seem to posses a thinking brain.,korrasami,cmvi2g7,8,t5_2ut7p

2667361,0,t1_cn6ee8e,IMO after the first half of the series Korra ending up with Mako would have felt forced and ingenuine. And while theres no question that she can take care of herself Korra is just kinda the type who needs someone to keep her grounded and provide the right kind of support when needed as weve seen throughout the series. So leaving her on her own at the end wouldnt have really made too much sense to me since anyone who could have truly been that person to understand that about Korra would have to be really close to her emotionally.While I personally doubt I would have been angry about it I probably wouldnt have felt as satisfied with the ending if it turned out differently.,korrasami,cn6qyr9,1,t5_2ut7p
2667412,0,t1_cn6r406,Yup.  Nail on the head.The most crazy thing about her is that shes the optimist of the Krew.  Bolin is the Idealist Mako is the Realist and Korra is actually the pessimist most of the time because she beats herself up a lot.,korrasami,cn6r7ct,9,t5_2ut7p

True Asami is a great mechatank pilot but she could learn to chiblock.And while shes at it maybe make herself a grappling hook so she can keep up on foot some kind of multipurpose projectile she can throw some smoke bombs put it all on a utility belt maybe add a cape for intimidation and goggles to guard her eyes...Something a little like this perhaps Not my art just think its cool.,korrasami,cn70lh1,11,t5_2ut7p

You know what happen when a spirit enter a human they become permanently change. So Asami could have vampire bat fang and develop a need for blood. She wont necessarily transform other if she bite them nor develop any other abilities.

Went to post this and saw there were comments here and figured itd be a great crowd to talk withOne of the coolest things about this video is I hadnt ever considered slash and femslash as a sort of... symptom? or reflection on the current state of female characters on screen especially the point about how that the reason theres so much slash fic is due to the abundance of male characters thus making the Korra and Asami characters and their dynamic with and without ships all the more valuable.Like fanfic has just always been oh that thing that people do because stuff and things. I understood it at a glance but not in this context which I think PBSIC does an awesome job of analyzing and presenting. Keep being awesome yall! Hopefully well get to a point where there are better characters for everyone on screen. ,korrasami,coipeda,9,t5_2ut7p

3101990,0,t3_2vn2m2,Speaking as a writer and an avid fanfic reader I personally think that authors get plenty of attention.  However that attention isnt focused nearly enough on the stories that imho are actually great.You should take another gander at the fanfic recs in the sidebar.  It took me a long ass time to sort through all the prefinale gunk and curate the best written Korrasami fics to put in there.  Those stories deserve more attention which is why I did that in the first place.Which is why its disappointing and frankly very surprising that you neglected to include anything by Clarias.Heres where to find them.And lets not forget Beechs Republic City BluesAs well as Love Will Tear Us Apart Again also by Beech.Oh and This World Weve Created by Bojangles.Or probably one of the most interesting and wellwritten PostSeries Korrasami fics Ive ever seen which is criminally underread for how unique it is. Reparations by Carrogath.You may be in a riotous mood and I get that but literally every story youve linked here has a MASSIVE following. And yeah some of the ones Ive linked here are pretty big too but its because theyre excellent and its ludicrous for them not to be on this list.  If you want authors to get more attention focus on the lesser known ones. Ive got like  more lesser known fics that were buried under the sea of AUs so let me know if you want me to keep going.,korrasami,cojiqal,2,t5_2ut7p

3275062,0,t1_cp19qvw,You are so on point with this comment.One of the the reasons why I wanted Korrasami to happen was because Korra amp Asami had suffered so much in their young lives.Their suffering brought them not only closer but I think it contributed to them finding peace from each other. When you are with someone who understands suffering like you do that often forms a very strong bond.Its so satisfying to get the ending we did in LoK. I think some fans overlook the tragic events that happened to Korra amp Asami throughout the series especially Asami.Asami in a way is a perfect example of the saying Why do bad things happen to good people? Asami never once did anything malicious or regrettable throughout the series yet she endured some of the most tragic events out of all the characters.I kept asking myself why does Asami have to suffer so much?Once Hiroshi was murdered that was the last straw for me. At that point I would have gone insane if Korrasami didnt happen if Asami didnt find happiness and peace with Korra I dont know how I would have reacted.,korrasami,cp1l15x,7,t5_2ut7p

3402180,0,t3_2z45i2,Ive seen literally two episodes of this show and the relevant portions from Jail Break so I might not be the goto authority but Im going to disagree with you.Yes while all of the gems are technically sexless the lack of sex organs doesnt mean they have no gender. Ruby and Sapphire present as female and even the more masculineappearing Ruby is undeniably female. The fact that they dont have vaginas doesnt make their relationship which is stated as romantic btw any less legitimate or important than Korra and Asamis.Even within the show itself Ruby and Sapphire wanting to stay permanently fused as Garnet is similar to Rose Quartz giving up her physical form to create Steven not sure if they ever explained how that works btw. They give up themselves as individuals to form one person because they wouldnt want to be separated at any cost.Bonus queer points this song is queer as hell yo. Emphasis mine.gt Cant you see that my relationship is stable?I can see you hate the way we intermingleBut I think youre just mad cause youre singleAnd Youre not gonna stop what we made togetherWe are gonna stay like this foreverIf you break us apart well just come back newerAnd well always be twice the gem that you areI am made ooooof looooveooooove looooveoooooveAnyhow I might be wrong on some points because I dont watch the show but feel free to correct me if Im wrong.tldr gender isnt dependent on biology this is still a big damn deal.,korrasami,cpg2odi,7,t5_2ut7p

3624861,0,t3_31uxhk,Im a straight male but seeing the ending still had a profound effect on me mostly because I saw the incredible good it has done and continues to do for those looking for representation. It reminded me that stories and characters like the ones in Avatar have an outward effect on the real world and that I want to be apart of that change in the future.Heres what I wrote...gtIts been so long since Ive felt this way... like a spark of creativity no a lightning bolt of inspiration has reconnected me with my younger self. Ive found purpose and direction like I havent had in years. If im sounding too overdramatic its simply because I want to get across to you this one point. Your hard work and dedication to the art of storytelling and animation has been the biggest wakeup call of my life. You see I am an animator who lost his way somewhere between money and responsibility... as I sat down on Dec th  and watched the final  episodes of Korra I remembered that we have the ability to change the world. You showed me Ive been wasting my time and talent working for corporations who use animation only for monetary gain... This is not what I wanted to do with my life. I took this profound realization and used it to fuel my creativity. Now Im drawing writing and animating with heart again. My spare time is consumed with a passion that I have not felt since I first started down my long road to becoming an animator and hopefully soon Ill be working towards changing the world just like you did for me.gtgtI cannot thank you enough for all you have done for me.gtgtSincerely gtnameIm busy writing and creating my own stories now thanks to Korrasami  Maybe Ill be lucky enough to make my own TV show someday.,korrasami,cq5gm1z,4,t5_2ut7p
