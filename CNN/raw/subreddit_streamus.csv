1089429,0,t3_265tru,I think that would mess with the point of streamus if you want a lightweight music player with no ads go streamus. If you want to watch a youtube video go to youtube.,streamus,chs4d3s,4,t5_2vsgk
1166547,0,t3_278xhp,Hey. Ill keep it in mind. Im probably going to add additional details to Search Results but Im not sure if those details should also be visible once added to your collections.,streamus,ci0uu4a,2,t5_2vsgk
1247970,0,t1_ci9vyzm,Honestly I see it as an opportunity. Find the top indie music sites and integrate them. The one thing that I hate about Pandora is that I never hear new music because they have the same  songs they play and when I am on a long listen I hate hearing repeats that I have heard an hour ago.,streamus,cia0g6g,0,t5_2vsgk

2945287,0,t3_2ttj8y,Hey Ive got an issue where Streamus doesnt want to play anything. I can get YouTube videos to play so I dont think its a connectivity problem or issue on YouTubes side.I press play and the video just doesnt progress. I also cant click pause. Ive tried reloading disabling the extension and reenabling and even a restart. Let me know if you want any more information.,streamus,co2w5av,1,t5_2vsgk

3715407,0,t3_32wq53,HeyA few things I cant provide exporting actual songs to file. Any sort of download functionality would get YouTube pissed at me. You can save a copy of your playlists to a URL by opening the leftside panel rightclicking a playlist and clicking Copy URL. Then you can send that URL to yourself. You can also export your playlists to CSV or JSON by clicking the Export option next to Copy URL. However this was really just added as an afterthought for integration with other peoples code. Youd have to have something that can parse that data for it to be really useful at all.,streamus,cqfs6lb,1,t5_2vsgk
3763739,0,t1_cqla3h3,I have turned down a lot of companies to pursue working on Streamus yes. Maybe that came off as a humble brag but really just trying to emphasize where my priorities are.,streamus,cqlam06,4,t5_2vsgk
3774960,0,t1_cqmk5q1,Do other keyboard shortcuts work? It sounds like Chrome just doesnt recognize the media keys on your keyboard.,streamus,cqmkn9y,1,t5_2vsgk
3860712,0,t3_34kk4h,Heh not currently. I need to enhance the search a bit to show songs in your playlists as well as YouTube search results.,streamus,cqwctew,2,t5_2vsgk
4064157,0,t3_372yec,You can disable the ability for Streamus to run when Chrome is closed by going to chromesettings gt Show advanced settings gt System gt uncheck Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed.Im going to be moving this functionality to an optin permission instead of providing it by default as it seems to not be desired for many people. ,streamus,crjjjw3,1,t5_2vsgk
4154844,0,t1_crtlkpz,Oh well I thought so. No way to use the search provider functionality and connect it with the extension because you can still change the keywords for those?,streamus,crtv5qr,2,t5_2vsgk
4328260,0,t3_3869lr,You know Ive always wondered whats the point of having the Now Playing queue be separate at all? Mine is always a  copy of the playlist Im currently listening to so couldnt it just play directly from a playlist?,streamus,csdivtd,1,t5_2vsgk

4587218,0,t3_3dt0yr,May I suggest opera instead. Its based on the chrome engine and thus supports chrome extensions. Its got mouse gestures for cool navigation. And its not as bloated as firefox. Best of both worlds. ,streamus,ct8tfcz,3,t5_2vsgk
4596709,0,t3_3cyftf,Hi uMeomixStreamus is amazing and I love it and Im really sorry that youve put in so much work to get cut down by legal problems.If its really just the API vs nonAPI issue that they cant get past and I understand that the conditions theyve given you arent consistent I read through the whole bewildering email exchange do you think itd be possible for Streamus to simply bypass the API for video playing and just manage a tab with a youtube page?  If youtube.com is playing back the content and Streamus is just acting as a search and playlist manager it seems really hard to make an argument against it  and as a bonus ads would be guaranteed to work.Its another big hit to the slick interface of Streamus but hopefully it could keep functionality intact.I understand though if youre loath to invest more time given how shaky theyve made your footing already.Apologies if youve had to answer this question a bunch already.,streamus,cta08cn,1,t5_2vsgk
4683825,0,t3_3dwl3p,In order to get the video showing you need to uncomment out the things that he commented.Go to StreamusChromeExtensionsrcjsforegroundviewvideovideoRegion.js and edit this file.Instead of looking like thiscreateVideoView function       this.shownew VideoView        player StreamusFG.backgroundProperties.player              return VideoRegionIt should look like thiscreateVideoView function       this.shownew VideoView        player StreamusFG.backgroundProperties.player              return VideoRegionI dont really know why he commented them out seeing though it is in the original streamus. Upvote because its a really easy fix and people should know how to do it.,streamus,ctkxx8n,2,t5_2vsgk
