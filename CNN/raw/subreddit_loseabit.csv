4437913,0,t3_378bss,I read an article one day that changed my life forever. I have lost about  pounds and have a little bit more to lose. Truth is I did not stay motivated the whole time at all. But I told myself that I set a damn goal and Im keeping it whether I feel like it or not. This is the difference between discipline and motivation.
