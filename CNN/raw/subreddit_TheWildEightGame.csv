10760643,0,t1_ddo8kne,I havent beaten the game yet nor have I looked at your spoilers because I want to discover it myself but I dont get why people complain its hard either. Im on my rd or th play and Im absolutely destroying the game. I have a ton of reserve food all fur armor and all steel weapons and its not even day . I think one thing people seem to be having trouble grasping is that the game is nomadic and you dont have a stationary base like you do in other survival games or at least I dont which is the point of the tent and workshop being so easily movable. Just exhaust one area pack your stuff up and move. Replant yourself somewhere new with resources nearby. I also build a storage chest at every campfire and store a stack of each resource and a full stack or two of food so if I die I can get back to my former progress more smoothly. Also I think people grossly underestimate the power and utility of traps from the few streams Ive watched. Rabbit traps blow but the other traps can kill everything so easily its embarrassing. When I see a wolf I preemptively drop traps to kite him through. Easiest bunch of resources ever. Tldr I dont understand why people think the game is hard either. Traps ftw. ,TheWildEightGame,ddpvq1h,1,t5_3ch9t
