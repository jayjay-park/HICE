1034899,0,t3_25xmf7,Theres honestly no Best Team it depends on how you build it up and what items you apply to it E.G. you could have a full team of magicians at a high level that all have MAG on them which just adds hardly any damage or you could have a mixed team with different stats at a lower level and have more fighting power than the mage team and also remember to apply the best compo items for different characters. i tried to put it as simple as possible,DanBall,chlx8gd,2,t5_2xh4h
