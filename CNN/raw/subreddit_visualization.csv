1614531,0,t1_cjil0jz,It is fairly pricey and thats not even including the cost of the hardware needed for the server.  But depending on how many users youre wanting to be able to share the visuals with they also have a hosted version that is much cheaper until you start having a large amount of users.  It depends on what you mean by keeping your data private and secure but its a cloud system that follows strict datacenter security guidelines that are documented and audited.But the real question is what are you spending for reporting now?  It doesnt matter if youre looking at Tableau or Cliq or Microstrategy etc but any of the major companys prices arent going to be so much lower that it makes a huge difference.  And I was shocked to find out what we were paying for traditional reporting software that we have since retired in favor of visualinteractive solutions.Heres what I would do Google for Gartner Business Intelligence Magic Quadrant and find the  copy.  Odds are youll have to enter in your information for a sales lead to get it but thats okay.  Then read through the whole report not just the quadrant part.  Theyll break down all of the serious players and outline the highslows of each including some rough insights into pricing.  Not dollar amounts but youll be able to tell whos super expensive and who isnt.  We went through an extensive POC testing project with several visualization tools and we started with the requirements you outlined.  So feel free to DM me if youd like.,visualization,cjiofkd,3,t5_2qhn4

You will have to find a file which represents Ethiopia though  I had ESRI shapefiles which could be read by the R package sp. In fact I was even able to export it all out to google maps... I used the following libraries with very little previous GIS experience To set projections and stuffTo map ESRI Files and DataExport results as google mapsGood luck I had a lot of fun doing it.

6837031,0,t3_49a1q6,Are these  options consistent across the dataset?In terms of approaches to visualise it really depends what youre trying to show  say. For example Is there a trend potential or suspected that you want to reveal? Is there some kind of periodicity you want to reveal for example option  occurs more often than others combined in the first two weeks of a month but never occurs in the third week? Is a monthbymonth comparison of frequencies what you want to show?What you want to show which may well be more than one thing is key to deciding what visualisation to use.Try thinking about it more generally in terms of one of these four types of visualisation objectives Comparison Relationship Distribution Compositionwhich are perhaps demonstrated more clearly in this picture .pdf.,visualization,d0ra3a0,1,t5_2qhn4
8256746,0,t3_4sivay,Thats a hard one... I would still recommend d.js. It is not that complex really and has tons of boilerplate examples available. It is a lot easier and faster edit faster to build visualizations than R or Python and is already native for web embedding.gt We are ok with the idea of paying money but open source is cool too.. Just as a side note When using open source software as a profitable business it is common courtesy to give some money to the developers regardless.,visualization,d59netf,3,t5_2qhn4
