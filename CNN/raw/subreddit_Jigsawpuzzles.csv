145240,0,t3_1vqcnm,First of all how many pieces? Is she experienced enough? You have to start with this because generally not all images come in all sizes. If you are looking for  pcs puzzle the choice will be different from  pcs.,Jigsawpuzzles,ceuz2jm,1,t5_2t5sq

4338745,0,t3_3am5qe,I didnt have a lot of time for puzzles with work and obligations this week.  BUT for fathers day my family turned one section of a generic purpose room in our house into a puzzle area for me.  They cleared out the floor area and moved the sofa that was in this room over a bit to make an basic outlined square.  They then moved my puzzle table and chair into this area and assigned it as my puzzle space. The primary reason they did this was because they had purchased a  piece puzzle for me that did not come in yet hopefully Tuesday and they knew I would need more room and for a longer time to work on it than just my card table.  This will be my biggest puzzle yet as my previous largest was  pieces due to the size of my table.  ,Jigsawpuzzles,csepfpp,4,t5_2t5sq

5571772,0,t3_3reoko,I feel for you. When I was making my  map puzzle I accidentally locked my bunny in the puzzle room over night. She ate a couple pieces and tried to dig a bunny hole in the middle. I was so sad I bought a new one. I ended up finishing the first one though and it wasnt so bad once I got working again. ,Jigsawpuzzles,cwnqa3c,2,t5_2t5sq

6992610,0,t1_d17wnyd,Good job! These ones are really hard.  If you dont want anything fancy you can get a lt poster frame from Walmart. They just have plastic front and a cardboard back which is good to spray with black spray paint as the puzzle will look much better against a black background. Dont even have to glue it as long as you clip it in well otherwise it will not be even and sag over time although the Buffalo puzzles can be on the loose side so glueing may be necessary.,Jigsawpuzzles,d18ydvi,1,t5_2t5sq

7622998,0,t1_d38008d,Because of my advice?   BTW tip for those of you reading this Use a scalper not a utility knife. You should be able to buy them at a craft stores. Applying the usual force you use on a utility knife makes uneven cuts I strongly advise against that.,Jigsawpuzzles,d38p0cz,1,t5_2t5sq
7841418,0,t3_4mq959,Beautiful puzzle. Had a duplicate piece so I assume some poor soul is a piece short.  May put together a time lapse later but the webcam defocused for about a quarter of it.,Jigsawpuzzles,d3xfzbw,1,t5_2t5sq
8122259,0,t1_d4szgtu,Im just worried that if I opened it now I might lose some of the pieces in the move. That would be heart breaking so the box stays sealed.Best of luck with your puzzle with selfcontrol or with not losing any pieces ,Jigsawpuzzles,d4t0jkr,1,t5_2t5sq

8707556,0,t3_4ywffh,The best is what you did...get a board or sheet rock from Home Depot or Lowes. They do  cuts on the board for free usually and additional cuts are only fifty cents each. So Id recommend making one your perfect size.  x  is a gigantic hunk of living room floor usually for just a  piece puzzle.,Jigsawpuzzles,d6u2vu8,1,t5_2t5sq

9625809,0,t1_d9zfc6d,Oh no! I dont think I could bear to take it apart Id definitely cry if it fell apart before I have it glued...it was such a pain to put together I dont want to have to do it again. I can understand not wanting to look at it again though if you didnt enjoy it at all! I love Escher though so I am looking forward to hanging this one up.,Jigsawpuzzles,d9zkv5k,1,t5_2t5sq

10865805,0,t3_5vbn9a,I make and sell handmade wooden jigsaw puzzles both with pictures and just wooden ones and I started with a cheap  scroll saw I have since upgraded. Im not sure if cookie cutters would really be a viable option. If you look on craigslist you may be able to find a scroll saw for under . Working with the wood is a beautiful thing and when you finish a puzzle you get a wonderful sense of accomplishment. And its not that hard either! ,Jigsawpuzzles,de0qbap,1,t5_2t5sq
