I was just seeing if some one knew what the resistances were suppose to be so I didnt have to figure it out my self. Thanks for your response. I will post what I find. ,LandCruisers,cic8sja,3,t5_2so8z

3362874,0,t3_2yowfp,Bold move putting a car below a series. I was once told there are only two types of Land Cruisers those that leak oil and those that are out of oil. As a former  owner and current  owner I agree with that statement. ,LandCruisers,cpblcjg,5,t5_2so8z

5482017,0,t3_3q4mti,Define an engine overhaul? Everyone is going to tell you head gaskets are bad I wheel with about  trucks out here with anywhere from k to almost k on the odometer. I only know of a couple of them that have had head gaskets done the rest are going strong. Maintain it thats important but also remember these motors were designed to work in the harshest climates for a long time. Typically when something fails on these trucks they still get you home. Name me another motor with oil jets to cool the cylinders individually in addition to the ones that run down the cam shafts and crank. Thats some super car engine shit you dont usually see that on a forklift motor. Toyota designed them for three rebuilds in the life of the motor estimating that it might need one at km intervals. Meaning that every km it could be stripped down bored and a bigger set of cylinders put in. Here in the US weve found that the motors can go upwards of  miles without needing it. Toyota definitely underestimated what the FZ is capable of. Engines that have been pulled apart at k miles here in the US still have the hash marks visible on them I would venture a guess that nothing in the engine is worn enough to warrant a full rebuild with boring until those are no longer visible and the motor is definitely tired. Besides that the guys that replace the head gasket as a preventative maintenance are pulling apart a seal that was installed in the cleanest environment the engine will ever see the factory. I wouldnt break that seal unless it was absolutely necessary. ,LandCruisers,cwcdnlc,4,t5_2so8z
5486881,0,t3_3q4mti,On my case my truck has k miles. Original engine transmission transfer case and axles. Nothing has being rebuilt before. I ll be doing my front and rear axle seals soon. There not bad bur they are over  years ago and dont want them to go bad while I m out in the trails. I did a compression test and had the same numbers that the workshop manual states  psi.  months ago I pulled my oil pan to replace it  it rusted  and checked  main bearing and  connecting rod bearing. They both look fine. The babbitt is gone but the bearings are not scratched or anything. Oil pressure good. These cars are just hard to kill. Plain and simple. ,LandCruisers,cwczzyz,1,t5_2so8z
6490511,0,t1_czqnx30,In for a  swap. Nobody in the US has parts or knows how to work on the old Diesels. Plus now its got about hp and ftlb. ,LandCruisers,czqo160,2,t5_2so8z
6683306,0,t3_475dzl,Ive heard of a shop putting the Colorado  cylinder in these and were much happier.  Its lighter and with being dual overhead cam it moves more air and more efficient.  Just a thought good luck!!,LandCruisers,d0am1xx,2,t5_2so8z

8035046,0,t3_4pa1l6,This was a recent regional gathering of Cruiser owners organized by Toyota Gunma RV Park at a ski resort in Gunma Prefecture. They were giving rides in the Megacruiser. It was just  mph stuff so I didnt partake. Lots of the new th Anniversary  Series GRFE Cruisers. Lots of FJCs. Fewer s and s and s. A fair number of s and s. The big Land Cruiser Meeting is later this fall September? near Hiroshima iirc.,LandCruisers,d4j7qmk,3,t5_2so8z

9475074,0,t1_d9gxt27,Im in Seattle. I brought it over from Japan last September. Since then Ive put in a turbo removed the muffler onboard air compressor and a locking rear differential. The tires went on last Friday. Next and final move for a while is to put an Old Man Emu suspension with a  lift. I moved the exhaust tip to just behind the drivers door in front of the rear wheel and used . stainless to improve airflow. I also have an intercooler sitting in my garage but cannot figure out where to mount it yet. I dont want to cut a hole into my perfectly functional hood. ,LandCruisers,d9h09v8,3,t5_2so8z
9709172,0,t1_da9ufeo,Stock suspension and height with slightly larger tires. I did check air tire pressures this morning and the fronts were  PSI under inflated. I havent noticed a noise since inflating the tires but Id be surprised if that changed driveline angles that much.,LandCruisers,da9v49y,1,t5_2so8z
9812007,0,t3_5flz29,No. Buy one with the original motor and trans in it. This thing is a rusty turd now that they put the Chevy motor and trans in it. ,LandCruisers,damjg4l,2,t5_2so8z
10053018,0,t1_dbhxg8e,Body temp will keep it up a few degrees. My  series is warmer than my old runner so it depends on how well insulated your  is. It does get cold enough that I warm it up before getting out of the sleeping bag. I bet your dog will help. Bring a quilt for him. ,LandCruisers,dbhxlzk,2,t5_2so8z

10973038,0,t3_5wj3m5,I had  orders with them in January a front wiper install motor wiper arms and all hardware except linkage and a steering column cover. Both shipped within  days of me ordering.Bought from them  times total and Ive always been happy with everything. I like their prices a whole lot more than some of the other online cruiser parts stores for used parts.  Ive never experienced slow shipping or lack of phone communication. I know its a smaller operation so maybe they just get slammed?You can definitely find great deals on mud. It might take a little while to get a goto list of contactsvendors but definitely worth checking into.  ,LandCruisers,debsqe2,1,t5_2so8z
11495831,0,t3_63oxea,Either tow hitch cam or backup camera.  They are designed to be powered off your taillight wires I believe.  The cord that looks like the headphone jack could possibly be your video out.  Polaris is an Australian vehicle accessories company.  That camera is probably designed to feed directly into your toyota nav screen using this kit or something similarHere is a similar camera on their site  ,LandCruisers,dfz1vdg,2,t5_2so8z

The  series prados were considered the light duty  version with coil springs slightly lighter solid front diffs than the HD s also they had a different grill and front fenders.
