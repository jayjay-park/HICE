100046,0,t3_1v88sg,I  agree with you. For me personally the reason that I got bored of MineZ and practically gave it up for other gamemodes like annihilation and smash and hcf was because I always felt far too safe. I never had that adrenaline rush of not knowing what was around every corner and wondering if I could survive it or not. I love it so much better this way. This gamemode should be about danger and fear and adrenaline and the unknown. If they end up reverting the zombies back to the way they used to be Ill be pretty sad.,ShotBow,ceptk2t,2,t5_2vk7n

118542,0,t3_1vf1qj,The below is my personal opinion and I dont know that it reflects the views of Shotbow as a network.I understand what your complaint is and its a valid complaint  but your solutions not so much.  A public server doesnt really solve what you think it will.  Normally I wouldnt bring this up but most hackers play on throwaway alt accounts without premium.  A public server would have to deal with that especially since itd be popular for getting away from whats misinterpreted as the premium playerbase.Being a premium doesnt make you a bandit.  There are plenty of normal bandits too.  Such people for some reason enjoy playing that way and eventually donate probably to play on the PvE server.Now the reason PvE is private is to encourage users to buy premium.  Its one of those benefits of being a premium member and supporting the server and we have many membership tiers and levels to make that affordable.At the end of the day we have a bottom line we need to feed in order to keep the servers running and so this is unlikely to change.You might be interested in my MineZ RP Server project as it will introduce a new playstyle but I honestly cant see a Public PvE or a NonPremium Only server happening.What Im thinking now is that I need to set aside some time maybe with Majicou and we need to look at whether or not spawn kits need to be nerfed and think of a good way to do that since the problem comes back to those.,ShotBow,cerxhbk,1,t5_2vk7n

EDIT What I meant is that in the early days buying Plat would give you among other things a sign with your name on a building.I think that he got a block because back then all the buildings were already occupied but I am not completely sure.

It doesnt really require these changes. Of course if were talking about XP shop stuff that may be tough to restrict PvE from... but there could be away. But I digress.People usually ask for no XP spawn kit items. But they forget there are good and harmless items you can buy or even unlock in an achievement.Side question here because Ive never bought swords or armor in the XP shop Does it replace your wooden sword and armor accordingly or just add to it?,ShotBow,cf7mma9,2,t5_2vk7n

Dont have your password be qwerty instead use this and crank that up to a  character password. Now you may ask Blist how do I remember such a password! Just make a simple text document on you desktop and paste it there. That way you can just copy and paste every password safely into one document. unless they ratt you then you are phucked either way This will ensure a safe unbruteforceable account D,ShotBow,cg177uy,3,t5_2vk7n

If someone were to pick this up off a players corpse they could learn from it.  Learn how to use items craft and just the general experience of the dead player.In MineZ  when you were given achievements it would pop up in the chat box automatically.  This message could pop up in your book as well as in the chat box.Also for writing notes in the book they should be kept to your own eyes only.

Like in the past saturation in minecraft was good on its own and nobody complained nor did you guys see the need to change it. So why when minecraft makes it bad should we just keep it bad.

2428746,0,t1_cmbut8x,Hacking is not part of the game youre twisting my words. Yes gambles might make it  times easier to kill someone and thats shotbows fault and shotbow need to balance it not the community. Fighting without a gamble might be better balanced but if its less effective then the community have no reason not to use it.Indeed it is a chain reaction it should be if something is op then by using it as much as possible you can make it extremely clear to the devs that it needs changing.I know gambles are ruining your game hell I dont want that to continue but the only way it will stop is if gambles get nerfed.Youre asking for a community refusal to use something completely within their rights to use you might as well be asking the community to stop sprinting when they fight.You want this item boycotted because without it MineZ will be more fun right? MineZ will be more fair and better balanced. You want better PvP. I completely agree. MineZ would be but boycotts wont deal with the underlying issue that gambles are causing a problem by being broken in the first place.Its not your fault and you cant expect everyone to boycott something they are not only able to do but incentivised if they want to win PvP fights. If someone wants to win at PvP they have no reason not to use the most broken item and every reason to use it. If shotbow wont change the gamble move on and watch MineZ burn.,ShotBow,cmbweu6,1,t5_2vk7n

3169042,0,t1_coqgkxe,MineZ  normally has more players than MZC.  My opinion has been that if the people clinging to MZC prefer it over MZ then there is something that needs to be addressed to improve MZ.The last time I voiced that opinion I was downvoted and no constructive discussion came from it.  Nostalgia glasses are understandable but the administration does not see any value in pumping more resources into the MineZ codebase.There is of course some value in finishing up the dungeons and builds and getting an enjoyable loot table running  but my true opinion is that if youd rather play MineZ Classic instead of MineZ  we should figure out why so that we can make MineZ  betterEdit I thought this was a newer thread  my point still stands,ShotBow,coqgx8h,1,t5_2vk7n
