I realize its a long shot and Im quite sick of explaining myself but Im doing what I can to help with this and I really dont need every petition expert on the internet telling me its a useless effort. Terence Rotolo himself has supported my petition and made it clear he wants to voice Frank again. That already has made what Im doing here worthwhile imo and is proof that the petition has done something. In the end its not going to hurt to have more signatures and its a very useful way to keep likeminded fans updated on Frank. While voting with our wallets would probably also help it may just as well be a futile effort except in that case youve paid money for no results. It wouldnt be a bad idea if you knew just how many people were going to join you in doing it but for me Im going to keep doing what I can on this end.

Because that couldnt be farther from the truth since Nickolls only said something DUE to the backlash towards the new performance.Its not even just the voice either. The apparent lack of survivor escorts A huge gameplay mechanic being reduced to something cut and dry. The lack of a time limit is not a fault because I understand how it contradicts the size of the world they are going for. But transforming the brand with a surface level perception of what it is. Killing lots of zombies which was never the goal of dead rising. The kill counter was almost never even implemented in the first game.But yes I agree.

10284361,0,t1_dc9rtnj,I wasnt trolling.One last thing about the Throwable Items.This is what hinders an experience here is an example which isnt exaggerated thank you very much.In Shantae there was this move that was slow and just wasnt fun to use you would transform into a creature by dancing.The dancing took ages to finish for something youd only use for a couple minutes.In Riskys Revenge they removed it and just made it so you could switch between creatures without the dancing and everyone praised it.But in the newest Half Genie Hero they included it back. Sure it was faster but why would you include something that no one liked in the first place?Being able to throw items didnt hinder the game at all.It wasnt tedious it wasnt annoying it didnt take forever.It was quick it was fun it was pretty much instant.It added to the experience because throwing Knifes at zombies is more fun than just stabbing zombies.Throwing pies at zombies was more fun than consuming pies.Shantae got it right with removing a gameplay mechanic that hinders and ruins the experience of the game.Dead Rising didnt.It might not be the best example but when it comes to hindering games at least you know what actually hinders a game and what doesnt.EDITAlsoThey want to keep making these games for years to come so the elements we will see remain are the ones that are most praised from critics and players alike.Removing Throwing items doesnt help the franchise continue its redundant.The franchise will still continue whether they include it or not.There is no reason for them to remove it at all. Its dumb that they did.EDITHere is something you can research.Look at Fallout  look at why people disliked the game and how its considered inferior to its previous games.It does the same thing that DR did removing Mechanics that did nothing wrong.,deadrising,dc9serz,1,t5_2s3ou

11703431,0,t1_dglsrgu,After some screwing around I figured it out. First off I was right theres some weird glitch on the One that limits how high or low you can point the camera as opposed to the  version. I got around it by using the weapon aim aiming at the sticker then switching to the camera view without exiting the weapon aim. This allowed me to obtain an angle that the cameras normal pan would not allow. Its worth noting that while in this position I could pan left and right fine and I could zoom in and out but if I panned up or down the camera would snap to its original height limit.,deadrising,dgmlpmx,2,t5_2s3ou
