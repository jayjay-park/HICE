86260,0,t3_1v313f,I think a huge chasm here is where do you create a middleground with a rationally driven character and mistakes made from emotionally charged situations? Where do you even divide the values?A character can be a proponent of rationalist values but still needs human faults of their own. Otherwise the story becomes less believable. Perhaps it could work if both the hero and the main villain are rational but with different political economic or socially driven values to create conflict.Thats just my opinion on it. It seems like some people are trying to make rational characters lack human biases completely and that makes for a boring story. ,HPMOR,ceo900w,3,t5_2t5xf

No.  According to my calculations from the implied size of Hogwarts the population of magical Britain is on the order of .

Suddenly canon makes a lot more sense right? Now ask yourself how well your instincts calibrated for the U.S. legal system will actually carry over to that small town if it were an entire country.So what Harry did in forming his own contract using a book and his own judgment of that books complexity was certainly risky.

All this info and mishmash of data serves to point out lessons and authors point. This whole fanfic started with a premise of pointing out mistakes in plot characters and overall modes of thinking of both people in story and as something that happens in real life that can be identified and fixed. Also mainstream sciences? there is no such thing as mainstream knowledge beyond basic education everything else depends on personal environment. If a child knows about heuristics and biases that may be caused by parentage curiosity word of mouth or sum such.EDIT What we have here is a failure to communicate.I did not mean by the original comment that  I like or dislike the bashing of original canon.I did mean it as comment in context of OPs question about Suspension Of Disbelief.Which is why  I mentioned the beginning of story and Harry as an already established data dump. That data dump is what OP may be considering an informed ability i could be wrong about his meaning which is something an author gives to his characters to make them seem smart.

Perhaps I didnt make that clear enough though.The rest is just a smear campaign for any hate group that might ever follow you. Which would be stopped the minute you are defeated or fake your death and be vilified for the crap it is.I think creating an antagonist that everyone could hate and fight against would actually pull more people together during the war. And if it was even worse to remember then it would be a better lesson to avoid in the future.Of course you cant stop all war or evil that way but its much easier for the public to point to how bad Hitler was and compare his deeds to evils today than it is to argue the pros and cons of segregating and marking people.

And per his dialogue with Hermione he did indeed stop trying to be a hero to do something he found more fun.A lot of people ask what Voldemort was up to in the seven... eight?... years after the disappearance of Monroe and his death. I think sure he maintained some semblance of a plan to pull a Palpatine just this time using Harry Potter instead of David Monroe but in all honesty I think Voldemort just spent seven years being a Dark Lord because it was super fun for him. I always assume Voldemort is essentially identical to Harry Potter except he wasis a sociopath. Whereas the maximum extent of enjoyment Harry is in role playing a Dark Lord Voldemort enjoys role playing a Dark Lord for more serious reasonsgoals... and has no ethical sense to stop him from nailing the skins of Yeremy Wibbles family to a wall not for the inherent sadistic thrill but more for the amusement of teaching his opponents to be more like him through cruel lessons e.g. to Dumbledore...

Relatively few people attempt the spell. Relatively few people find out that they are incapable of learning the charm.Dementors are a species well under control for the most part a specialized topic. NEWT Defense students who learn they are unable to cast the charm might be horribly disappointed they might put weeks into attempting to cast it they might become depressed at their failure but it would be an oddly desperate person indeed who went as far as casting memory charms on themselves to manufacture happy memories.If a truck has stopped with its tire on your childs abdomen you might well attempt to lift the truck with your bare hands and youll use a jack if you have one but youre unlikely to think of using a stick of dynamite to move the truck.gt And if false memories dont work it means at least one method exists that can distinguish between real and false memories.Of limited use.

Perfidy constitutes a breach of the laws of war and therefore making it a war crime as it degrades the protections and mutual restraints developed in the interest of all parties combatants and civilians In practice combatants find it difficult to respect protected persons and objects if experience causes them to believe or suspect that their adversaries are abusing a claim to protection under international law to gain a military advantage.gtInteresting Perfidy book | Perfidy film | The Treachery of Images Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcmxzssm oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecmxzssm.

3159798,0,t3_2wb9lo,I had a similar idea. Tom Riddle is incredibly good at forming new personalities. I think he may well have simply let the Voldemort personality become dominant he is Voldemort until V decides that it would be a good thing if Quirrell or Monroe or... were dominant and then hes that person. Suppose Harry had V at his mercy somehow. Could Harry use the same things that work on his dark side to help V form a personality that can cast the True Patronus Charm then somehow fix that goal in place perhaps with an Unbreakable Vow? This might well require doing some neural surgery to give Quirrell the ability to empathise. I note however that the horcrux spell rewrites brain structures. Either it can do this on a massive scale or Qs current body which is much to young to be the original Riddle body was sociopathic to start with or else Q has acquired the neural circuitry that permits empathy. Given that Harry is not a sociopath one of the latter two must be correct. Its entirely possible therefore that Quirrell is capable of empathy and just doesnt use that portion of his brain. ,HPMOR,copiesf,1,t5_2t5xf

3178455,0,t1_core8tm,gt There is other news but I shall be brief. The wards of Hogwarts record that no foreign creature has entered and that it was the Defense Professor who killed Hermione Granger.Keep in mind that Harry and several other witnesses actually saw the troll kill Hermione.So from Harrys standpoint he seesa a foreign creature troll entered Hogwarts and killed her andb wards say no foreign creature entered and Defense Professor killed herThese cannot both exist therefore either all involved had their memories messed with plus a halfeaten Hermione body provided or the wards have been compromised. Harry feels it is much more probable that the wards have been compromised given the number of people and the complexity that would be required to pull off the memory manipulation.But I think Harrys big oversight here was the assumption that a and b cannot both be true. He never spends  minutes actually thinking If I wanted to kill a student with a Troll how would I make the wards think it was not a foreign creature but was the Defense Professor?Then he should be considering the likelihood of there was a plan that subverted the existing wards vs the wards have been compromised.Furthermore he could also have realised that the attack on Draco did subvert existing wards rather than outright compromising them. The troll wards would be consistent with someone very smart is gaming the wards but does not have the power to completely ignore them.I think this is one of the reasons that Quirrell sends the barrage of helpful people at Harry when he is trying to think.

It fits his worldview far to well and has some logical flaws in it especially concerning the cup.So I had a thought. As Harry pointed out one thing to do with immortality is to share it. Which Flamel didnt swear not to. Further it is a part of wizarding culture to not share dangerous magic freely. And the stone is dangerous. It isnt just immortality it is also a weapon of utterly insane destructive potential.Theory  Baba Yaga is not dead. Perenelle was simply the first person she chose to share her secret with. Which okay not the most considered decision perhaps but you know libido. I give this one quite high odds. The most likely alternative is that her death was accidental which would be just.. ugh. Traumatic much?Theory  All those historical wizards that lived very long lives? Those were her further apprentices as she  being now appropriately cautious with the doomsday device  established that they could in fact be trusted with this level of power over a very long period of time. .. and probably some mindreading Most of them are also not dead.

3234359,0,t3_2x5vpe,May I offer an alternative explanation? In  Harry tells Dumbledore that the Dementor is a distraction. Reading the chapter in retrospect gives the strong impression Dumbledore is mining young Voldemort for suggestions and actually plans on implementing respective countermeasures.If the suggestion he takes away with is that many things will be diversions and his main goal is guarding the Philosophers stone he would in every instance of Voldemort activity periodically check the mirror during the timeframe. He would always be there in this sense.In any case chapter  makes for an interesting read. There is a short section where Dumbledore is extra suspicious of QuirrelgtHeadmaster Harry said quietly Professor Quirrell believes very strongly in livefire tests under realistic combat conditions. Wanting to bring in an actual Dementor is completely in character for him.gtNow the Headmaster was giving Harry a strange look.gtIn character? said the old wizard.gtI mean said Harry its entirely consistent with the way Professor Quirrell usually acts... Harry trailed off. Why had he put it that way?gtThe Headmaster nodded. So you have the same sense I do that it is an excuse.

Did Voldie attempt to kill Hermione because he just lost ALL of his horcruxes and not just one of his horcruxes? And how did he manage to lose ALL the horcruxes?

WHAT JUST HAPPENED BACK THERE at the end of Chapter ?Wait... that very very last action Voldie took when Harry interrupted him... was that to create a horcrux for Hermione or himself?  I am SORELY CONFUSED.Now that Voldie has the Stone and is resurrected he doesnt need Bellatrixs flesh and Harrys blood anymore. I wonder what use he still has for Harry. Perhaps... it pleases him to keep Harry around? But he could easily get someone to Obliviate Harry and even Confund him instead of risking the chance that fullyaware Harry might DESTROY THE UNIVERSE? And did Voldie just imply that killing him as he is would ... destroy him PERMANENTLY? He saidgt But you tried to end my true life jusst then sstupid child.

3244633,0,t3_2x9zyh,According to Quirrells explanation of the basic Horcrux given in chapter  in Parseltongue the Interdict prevents spells being passed on in this way. This doesnt seem to apply to Horcrux . presumably because the Source doesnt consider such minds to have died. The Interdict prevents one from gaining magical knowledge except through mindtomind transfers but doesnt block the generation of new knowledge one can work out how something was done from observations of what was done. Quirrell could simply write down exactly what one needs for the ritual and a whole bunch of hints to help Harry work out how the ritual works. The Interdict might work in such a way that giving Harry an explanation of exactly how it works would allow him to check his understanding for example the Interdict might make direct explanations incomprehensible until the secret is grasped so if the words suddenly seem to be English instead of nonsense he knows hes guessed correctly. Its also possible that rituals arent covered by the Interdict which seems very improbable or that Quirrell didnt really give Harry the ritual. ,HPMOR,coybbi1,4,t5_2t5xf

3247406,0,t3_2x8e7r,We have a great possibility for some intervention here.  Weve got a Time Turner with one turn left in it and if Im reading this correctly its right by Hermiones body.  If he can revive her and get her back an hour all kinds of options are available especially if she manages to get the stone before jumping back.  She can go get the professors the first year armies lay traps transfigure rocks into gases create a nuclear bomb that only she would survive... and the best part is Harry can execute this plan with the help from both his future self AND Hermione!  Havent seen anyone in this thread suggest timetraveling Hermione outside the generalized Ennervate solution by uhonoreddb which covers a lot of possibilities.Weve also got the start of the fic to go offgtBeneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver a fraction of a line...gtblack robes fallinggt...blood spills out in litres and someone screams a word.The partial transfiguration of legdirtair into piano wire seems to be a pretty solid means of disarming the many death eaters in the vicinity.  Possibly literally!  Difficult to use a wand without hands.  That would cover our tiny fragment of silver fraction of a line.  This of course was already predicted by several others in this thread.Harry was creative enough to think to use the body parts of others in class but now in this pinch he can use his own body parts as weapons.  He can transform his bones into preaimed dart launchers those darts loaded with instantparalysis poisons.  Maybe even thin enough for no one to notice.  Great for eliminating Death Eaters!  He can extend his piano wire leg hairs to slice through opponents and lead them with some sort of propulsion mechanism of assorted types.  If he can properly comprehend the mechanism of a gun he can create it inside himself and shoot it.  He can convert part of his body into a solid coating of sorts that appears to be Harry but is in fact nonliving while he himself is smaller and can use his wand at will since the one held by exoskeleton Harry is a dummy copy.  With his wand now free for use he can do anything he can do with a spell.  Alternately using the thin carbon fiber solution he can surround himself with practically invisible mesh shielding that catches any spell.  Certainly the Killing Curse can do many things but what happens if it strikes carbon nanotubes before making it to its target?  Probably nothing!  Doesnt work on something without a brain!  Furthermore if he can leverage this into a transportation mechanism which he tested with the lengthening rope transfiguration as I recall he can move his fathers rock into a convenient location.Weaving carbon nanotubes around the battlefield also means he can put caps on everyones wands causing any spell they cast to rebound.  This would of course be hilarious.  Id say he should crosssection Voldies wand to make it fall apart as soon as any attempt at magic is used on it but then the beat the horcrux network by throwing Voldies wand into a dementor pit solution falls apart.Not only that but since hes not constrained by Transfiguration ethics right now transfiguring a chunk of his leg into a rapidlyexpanding smoke would buy him enough time to cast a few spells.  If he can get the Stone Hermione and the Time Turner were in business.  Could even permanency the smoke and fix his leg after getting back.  If theres a knockout gas he can render himself immune to that would also be remarkably helpful especially if he can spread it properly.  It would be an interesting engineering challenge to fit a gas mask inside his own face without changing his appearance.  Best part is that smoke is transfigured by Harry magic!  Im pretty sure Voldie cant cast on it without a rebound!  He might not even be able to breathe or touch it without a rebound making Harry gas effectively a cloud of death to him.  This works with ANY gas especially invisible ones.  If Harry is able to turn enough of his body into a gas that the battlefield is littered with it any spell Voldie casts will rebound.  As such this is my highest confidence level tactic.  Eliminating Voldie as a spellcaster opens up all sorts of options.  Any Death Eater who remembers Transfiguration and realizes whats going on will realize a Finite on the smoke will give them transfiguration sickness and thus death and so would avoid it for now.  They probably wouldnt realize though instead blindly following instructions.  During this time Harry would hold his breath and then the Death Eaters all end up incapacitated because theres a bit of leg in their lungs.  Aiming other spells is difficult in a smoke cloud so its possible Harry could get out of this.  In addition to gas attacks getting himself earplugs and creating a flashbang would be fantastic.  The acorn potion was a great solution back in Battle Magic and Death Eaters dont know how to deal with that.  A full chemical flashbang would be even more effective.  Furthermore theres no reason he wouldnt be able to make a shaped explosive device thats harmless in his direction but shoots out fragments in a semicircle other than determining placement on his body unless he can make it on the ground I guess.  These tactics combined can temporarily negate Voldemorts casting on Harry and disable or kill all the Death Eaters.All of these selftransfiguration plans probably cover the blood spilling out in liters.  If your body is literally guns youre going to bleed a lot.  As will your enemies.Do we know if his wand can act upon itself?  If he transfigures the wood to be directly aimed at all his opponents in a splitting method he could try a Mass Somnium.  Dont know enough about wand construction or the rules regarding wand transfiguration.He could attempt to do a recursive intelligenceimprovement on himself but that is really not something you want to try for the first time in a dire situation with no supervision.There is of course always antimatter but that would cause problems.  Or a black hole if hes capable of making one.  Not sure how the rules would fit with that these arent really things you can test if you have any hope theyll be successful.  Similarly shattering the Time Turner would be helpful while extremely risky.  Is it still in its protective shell?ubenthor has one of my favorites so far setting up plans in his head with an indication signal until his future self responds to one indicating that it would work.  With the amount of crack ideas in this thread this is the best option unless it triggers DO NOT MESS WITH TIME.So my generalized solution is for Harry to come up with body transfiguration tactics test them all against his future selfs approval set up a shield of carbon nanotubes versus spells and then do a flashbanggas attack that prevents Voldie from intervening followed by some technique for incapacitating  death eaters loads of solutions for that really though hed have to have any transfigurationrelated ones prepped in advance since thats a fairly slow process.  Then get time turner stone and Hermione go back an hour and start plotting.uEliezerYudkowsky if the plan doesnt culminate in a snapping of fingers Im going to be really sad.,HPMOR,coylosn,3,t5_2t5xf

3281394,0,t3_2xkbb8,Proposed Solution while stalling by discussing one of a few things already mentioned wizard DNA partial transfiguration the nonlinearity of time as demonstrated by ComedTea the sentience of the sorting hat etc Harry will begin partial transfiguration of the ground beneath himself turning it to water as deep and wide as possible and also turning a thick layer near himself under the altar and under his stuff to wood.He finishes the transfiguration and the ground of a much wider area than he had planned gives way resulting in all the DEs LV and the mausoleum to fall into the water. LV flies out of the water almost as soon as he enters it not aware of the crumbling structure and strikes his head on the collapsing roof rendering him unconscious. Harry climbs onto the wood block after the building has fallen around him and calls the Philosophers Stone to himself. He then begins to transfigure the water to amber encasing LV and all the DEs inside. He uses the stone to render the transfiguration permanent by placing it on the amber before stabilizing it. Since he doesnt know if that is permanent as he has never used the stone before he will hold the transfiguration until he can get help in using the stone to make it permanent.Full VersionHarry looked up at Voldemort after not a moment of thought. If the Death Eaters are required to believe in blood purity surely they would have an interest in the experiments he performed with Draco months earlier.I know why magic iss fading. No trickss.Explain.Harry began to belabor in Parseltongue the science behind DNA and the experiments. As he easily recalled from memory all the details his wand lightly touched the dirt below him. He first began to transfigure a thick block of wood just below the surface of the dirt. The wood block began just behind him reaching around to the heap of his quest items and to the altar holding the one thing for which he came this far to in the first place Hermione. By the time this was done he had only began to get into the finer points regarding genetics.Voldemort eyed Harry with suspicion and the occasional twitch revealing his fading patience. He was surprisingly unenthusiastic about learning new things despite his clearly stated interest in learning more secrets.Harry poured his magic deep underground focusing as widely and deeply as he could on transforming the earth to water. The thoughts repeated themselves in his head. Wide. Deep. Water. Over and over.As he continued to painstakingly explain in Parseltongue each hypothesis and test related to his experiments the Death Eaters began to pass wands to their off hands and shift about to remain standing.ENOUGH! Voldemort yelled startling Harry out of his transfiguration effort immediately stabilizing his new creation. Almost as soon as the word was uttered the ground fell out beneath their feet in a quarter mile radius into water of an unknown depth. All of them including Harry falling into the muddy water.Voldemort reacted immediately flying upwards out of the water to dry his gun and kill Harry Potter.As he flew up from the water towards the approaching ceiling he did not realize his mistake until too late. The ceiling was approaching the surface of the water as the entire building fell into the water. Voldemort struck the ceiling at a high rate of speed losing consciousness immediately. For all the magic he commanded physics was still his master.Harry remained under his log until the crumbling stone had fallen past the surface of the water climbing onto the log as death eater spells fired in random directions useless against the building bearing down upon them.Accio Philosophers Stone! Harry called with an open hand. The Philosophers Stone flew out of the water and into his open hand. He immediately broke the water transfiguration caking himself with dirt. Harry could scarcely believe that he had succeeded thus far. He touched his wand to the dirt and began a new transfiguration dirt to amber. He made sure to start in the general vicinity of Voldemort as he remembered it transfiguring as deep and wide as he could unable to perceive the identities of the black bodies encased below. When he finished he touched the amber with the Philosophers Stone and stabilized the transfiguration in his mind.He couldnt be sure if thats all it took so he concentrated on maintaining the transfiguration until he could get help with using the stone.Harry then went to find Hermione already regenerated from the damage done by the falling structure. He sends his patronus to McGonagall to get help.Most of the students at the everlasting quidditch game had never seen Harrys patronus despite having heard about it. When it appeared before McGonagall and gave her its message she began to smile and cry before declaring joyously The Quidditch match is now over due to a school emergency!,HPMOR,cp2b0nd,3,t5_2t5xf

This part about breaking no seals which has been mentioned more than once in science fiction I believe and mostly with a negative connotation. Then Harrys trained himself to understand recursion among other things so whenewer it is a right thing for him to just STOP whatever he is doing now he just does it before it leads to any disastrous probabilities and doesnt follow your circle of doom.And I dont think a Vow can actually include absense of action cause then the entrophy would cause Harry to break the Vow the moment it was made or immideately start doing something about it which he didnt. From whch I conclude that should any event or a process not otherwse linked to Harry produce a potential of the worlds end Harry may as well do nothing about it and not break his Vow though if hes effectively one single person who couldve prevented the worlds end it would be a fulfilling of the prophecy. Though I seriously doubt the prophecy meant Harry and is of any relevance to whats going on at all. There were dozens of students and teachers in the hall the moment teh Seer spoke so it could as well be any of them who is connected to the prophecy and unlikely any of them to be COMING TO TEAR whatever there is to tear for all of them were already present in the hall.

No.Notwithstanding Vs parsletongue proclamations that Hermiones body was in fact the girlchild I believe that it is fully in keeping with Vs intentions within the scene to honestly resurrect her and apply the buffs we saw him apply.For one thing consider Harrys unbreakable vow. The clear intention there was to prevent Harry from ever trying anything that wiser saner lessrash counsel would have him not try. For that vow to work a such counsel needs to be available b Harry needs to utterly believe that such counsel will always be available c such counsel needs to be utterly trustworthy to him.The only person who fits those criteria is Hermione. But not just any Hermione an immortal invincible Hermione. Anything less might not be around forever to counsel Harry against destroying the world and therefore isnt good enough by the standards of snipping the threads of prophesy at every possible point to get Harry into the desired mental state for the vow.V has perfectly good internally CEV consistent reasons for honestly resurrecting Hermione just like Harry wants.As for the buffs those also fulfill what we can presume to be one of Vs secondary goals testing the Stones capacity to do such things before trying them on himself. After all imbuing somebody with unicorn and troll powers is not exactly a standard maneuver. Its untested magic and hed be a fool even moreso than leaving Harry with his wand not to try it on someone else first especially when trying it on Hermione supports his immediate goal of getting Harry to swear that vow in its strongest form.,HPMOR,cp5r519,4,t5_2t5xf

3417966,0,t3_2zdexa,... Im thinking you and EY have a very large values dissonance.Harrys fundamental goal is to save the world. Not to learn science for sciences sake but for the purpose of saving as many lives as possible for the people who are still alive. To defeat death first and then poverty war scarcity and suffering. So yes hes power hungry. You cant save the world without power and if theres one thing history teaches us its that humanity really really sucks at doing whats even vaguely good for it. Weve already lost the battle with global warming which was incredibly obvious and had an incredibly obvious solution.Thats also why hes manipulative  yes the people around him are idiots that need protecting which is why he has no real qualms about playing them like pawns for their own sake. He does eventually realize that thats a very slippery slope and starts pulling back but at the end of the day... Well. At the end of the day people are idiots and wizards especially. Mind not everyone needs protecting. Hermione was doing just fine for awhile until she ran afoul of a rational wizard decades older. Its not like Harry wins that battle either.As far as playing teacher goes  its not like hes not a student but magic is more like literature than anything else  it just takes lots and lots of time to learn. But you can start teaching people how to think with basically no prerequisites.I started skimming halfway through so just a few other notes  Writing style is a style thing.

Dont know about the magnet thingy.gt The problem with the threat is that Voldemort has an easy answer. Just ask Harry Tell me in parseltoungue whether you could hurt me if I shot you between the eyes right now. Since Harry doesnt want to carry out the threat that would be checkmate.Harry certainly possesses or believes to possess the ability to carry out his threat. He is aware of gametheoretical implications regarding this situation. His threat is pure upside for him carrying it out gt dead followers Voldemort needs a new body Harry dead not doing it gt Harry dead which means that the strategy of committing to the bomb is dominating the strategy of bluffing. I do not see a reason not to intend to carry out the threat.Voldemort knows this so for him the choice is between negotiating with Harry and inconveniences in the form of a small antimatter bomb. I would personally recommend the latter but it seems he has a tendency of trying to control critical situations see also his first defeat instead of cutting his losses.It gets a lot more interesting if you consider the time paradox generated by the explosion. This only applies for a sufficiently large explosion  mm of antihydrogen is about .  of Little Boy but the information on distance and wards is limited. A situation where Harry actually deploys the bomb becomes impossible luckily Voldemort conveniently chooses a highly improbable path resulting in Harrys survival which at this point seems to be the most straightforward solution for the time paradox.If one were to spin it further the knot in the timeline hints at an already existing complication with paradox potential  maybe the prophecy in conjunction with Voldemorts very methodical approach at avoiding it. In his desire to thwart it at every possible juncture he backed fate in a corner which in turn was forced to make some unlikely events happen explaining his uncharacteristic actions.

The second one was Quirrell is Azkaban.Also this is acknowledged in a much more literal way heregtThe green eyes of the BoyWhoLived were steady on hers. Would you trust Hannah to have the final say in whether she needed protecting?gtI  said Hermione and then paused. It was strange she knew the right answer and she also knew the right answer wasnt actually true. Hannah was trying so hard to prove she wasnt afraid even though she was and it was easy to see how the Hufflepuff girl might try too hard gtThen Hermione realized the implication. You think Im like Hannah?gt .........................................gtThe frustration was building up inside her again. Its my life! Hermione burst out. She could imagine what it would be like with Harry messing with her all the time constantly inventing justifications not to ask her first and not to listen to her objections. She shouldnt have to win an argument just to  Therell always be some reason you can always say Im not thinking right! I want my own life! Otherwise Ill walk away I really will I mean it Harry.Inuniverse this is justified by the fact that after all Harry did end up being ridiculously overpowered  highly rational in the world where it actually pays off yes Eliezer you wouldnt dare to create an original universe with Deathly Hallows and transhumanismkillable Dementors but you totally dared to make a universe where Timeless Physics are true and knowing them is a complete gamebreaker is internally literally Voldemort at his best has nonhostile Voldemort mentoring him has noble status has Lucius Malfoy owning him blood debt etc. It makes sense for him to be saving people around and it makes sense for anyone to be particularly concerned about saving those they love. If the story is set up this way the only alternative solution would be making some boy very smart and make Harry love him. That by the way would kill two birds with one stone  not only would it make the story more genderbalanced but also be a huge fuck you to the fandom that perceives all samesex love as inherently pornographic even if they love it they only love is as fanservice so you can kinda see the parallels between the perception of gay characters and female characters but few decades ago. SiriusPeter were a bit of that but main characters would make a much more solid point.Aside from that the rules of the universe strongly favor gender equality. Theres no inherent difference in magical power between witches and wizards and very few according to Quirrell realize that physical force is useful. And even if they did potions could solve that in no time. Furthermore since there are no indications of recent developments in reducing child mortality among wizards and they havent yet overpopulated the world they should have had efficient birth control for centuries. Thus the two most important factors that lead to the development of sexism in muggle societies were removed from wizards world for millennia. And EY does hit job acknowledging the following changes going as far as making Nicolas Flamel female  but offscreen. Witches have been doing great things before and Hermione will be the true heroine in near future but the story itself spotlights the exact time and place where none of it happens. Compare that to Following the Phoenix that actually describes Hermiones deeds. Its almost like HPMoR has Informed Feminism and FtP has the real one.

However when a far more advanced alien race attacks the magical girl superstructure underpinning humanity is forced to bring their collective powers into the open to save civilization. The story follows a girl who finds herself suddenly cast into the middle of the madhouses that are MSY Governance and war. If you like the idea of massive space battles whose outcomes are determined by the actions of organized teams of magical girls creatively using their powers advanced technology and AI in a universe where the fate of humanity is resting somewhere hidden behind the layered secrets of centenarianrun MSY blackops divisions hidden failures in Governances total control and the magical girl system itself... then youll like this story. ,HPMOR,csbfvkd,3,t5_2t5xf

And they do that by setting up detection spells... only on the houses of muggleborns since wizardraised kids can be supervised by their parents. That fits with the rest of their politics anyway.In canon underage wizards were only allowed to do magic at Hogwarts I think I remember canon Harry coming of age at the Weasleys and being all excited that he could use magic. That doesnt appear to be the case in MoR since eg s Draco gets a wand years before going to Hogwarts and practices magic at a young age. Though probably Lucius has the clout to arrange for Draco to be exempt from any restrictions so maybe this isnt evidence for kids generally being allowed to do magic in the presence of their magical parents.,HPMOR,cvb0ajb,1,t5_2t5xf

DMPoR as the best attempt Ive seen at an immediatefuture continuation into second year. Lots of twisty Slytherin plotting and the characters and dialogue are thankfully all written well enough to support it clunkywooden dialogue is something I see a lot of but I deeply appreciate the lack of it when the author has that skillOr for something original not strictly rational but really quite good rparahumans is the reddithome of and has links to the actual sites for  online serial novels by the same author who is now among my favourite wordwriting people.Worm is the first was linked to from one of MoRs author notes so theres notinsignificant overlap in readership and its a greatly original superhero story with a whole mess of fleshed out characters and factions heroes villains everything in between and one hell of a ramp in terms of stakes and spectacle and threat level.Oh also rrational has some really good stuff in the X but rational vein like Pokemon The Origin of Species I would add Pokemon The Line as well but sadly that seems to have stalled after just a few really good chapters and Animorphs The Reckoning and then Mother of Learning mageintraining gets caught in month long timeloop uses it to become OP while solving the mysteries of the setting isnt fanfic but is pretty good and the biweekly writing prompt challenge has produced some oneshots that are well worth reading.Hmm I read a bunch of stuff. Must be where all the time goes... if you want I can also recommend some books that were published in the traditional slices of dead tree format.Edit I remembered another one! Saruman of Many Devices  Lord of the Rings but if Sarumans palantir instead of connecting him to Sauron to be corrupted to the darkness connects him to a military AI from a scifi universe which feeds him technological and strategy tips to fight an open war against the endless hordes of Sauron instead of the story being won by a hobbit sneaking around. Author does at least a very plausible impression of someone who knows their shit when it comes to oldtime weapons and tactics to make a realistic progression from fantasymedieval to rifles and field artillery.They were mentioned further down the thread but I also forgot to mention Harry Potter and the Memories of a Sociopath and Tom Riddle and Conflicts of Interest as being good wellwritten stories ones a continuation of HPMoR the other is a look at Tom Riddle as a student. Oh and Minds Names and Faces is an AU branching off of the final arc of HPMoR with a Quirrell with a more complicated identity and some really quite well executed highpowered wizardfight scenes.Also have enjoyed from the CanonHP fanfic genre Blindness  Harry Potters facial scar is much bigger and leaves him blind but equipped with the ability to see magic instead of light... he doesnt go to Hogwarts but does end up totally utterly ridiculously overpowered dont read it for the plot tension there isnt any Nightmares of Futures Past  an older Harry from a war that was won at much greater cost than in canon zaps his mind back in time to get a doover with the benefit of futureknowledge Hogwarts Battle School  Voldemort kills Dumbledore in the first wizarding war Snape becomes headmaster Hogwarts becomes a martial academy against future Dark Lords with overtones of Enders Game.,HPMOR,cxdag4f,37,t5_2t5xf

Sure it takes a lifetime of effort to become elite but most people dont want or need elitelevel works. This is why artists feel perpetually underpaid.

Here I thought is an amazing opportunity to show how to work around the constraint that you cant change history and STILL save everyone. We can also see how utterly evil Missy is because she took the instrument that could do the most possible good and used it to torture everyone who had ever lived. We could have had powerful emotional moments where the doctor tried and failed to save everyone trapped inside adding real weight to the episode.

6774518,0,t3_48efg1,Okay editing and revising my point because this got downvoted.The average person that reads fanfiction especially in a popular category is going to be less worried about selfimprovement than any one of us are. While there are certain people who will learn lessons and apply the strategies presented those people are far outnumbered by the amount of people who will just return to bingereading. The real worry is trying to make the people who normally dont think deeply about something think more deeply about it not trying to give absolutely perfect advice to the people who listen. IIRC Eliezer linked to the sequences in his story and I think that would be sufficient caution.Worst case scenario a very very select minority adopt the techniques of arguing but use them in deliberately harmful ways  this might have a negative effect on those peoples lives but chances are weve only exacerbated a problem that weve always had because the sequences are free to read online. This is fine. As good as we are at winning arguments there are very distinct reasons that we cant use the techniques for lying and its not because it makes us feel bad  were kept in check by the rest of the community and we are already trying to correct skeptics and others who become too dogmatic. I think the benefits offset the costs costs that were already prepared for and have been counteracting.Sorry for being a bit abrasive the first time. I wasnt as careful with my words. This is why we have downvotes! Next time though please leave a reply with a suggestion for improvement whenever you downvote just as a generally helpful technique.

But theyre not aliens theyre human children and people read stories expecting all human characters to act like humans.

And frankly even if they did they wouldnt sound as smart as Richard Feynman so I might as well read something Richard Feynman wrote instead. Im isolated Professor McGonagall.

6879546,0,t3_49u50k,Im really not familiar with much in the way of board games or digital games like this but there is one game I know of that sortof fits this idea Secret Hitler.Its a multiplayer game thats played with  people where one person is Hitler  people are Fascists based on player count and the rest are Librerals. The Liberals are trying to pass enough Liberal policies through the government to win while the Fascists are trying to pass Fascists policies. The first group to six policies wins but passing the th and th Fascist policies lets the person who passed it kill one of the other players and if the killed player is Hitler the Liberals win. Each group tries to figure out who is in the other group the Fascists know who each other are and who Hitler is but neither Hitler nor the Liberals know who the Fascists are.So the part of this game that sortof fits your question is that Hitler wants to cooperate with the Fascists but he needs to figure out who they are by looking at how they behave with regards to Policies. However the Fascists are hiding their identities from the Liberals so theyre not making it easy for Hitler to do that.If you want to see this game in action check out Secret Hitler Sundays on youtube.

Instead of asking what artifacts might be cool or useful in the moment think about what sort of frequent and important needs the Malfoys are likely to have had over the years and how they might attempt to meet those needs in artifact form.  Then decide on a few of those needs for which they would have found a device to help while the rest would be likely failures.

But real goal as revealed by how everyone involved actually acts is to put on an impressive display of skill. That is entertaining. Its basic display of fitness stuff. It can often be boiled down to would a potential sexual partner find this attractive? Usually getting the highest score is a great proxy for this. But not always.Throwing underhand is not sexy. Thats why audiences dont want to see it and players dont want to do it and coaches dont push for it. When the stated and revealed goals come into conflict everyone who realizes what the true goal is will choose the to act in a way to maximizes that goal impressivenessentertainmentsexiness.

So Quirrells first thought is to persuade Harry to give up. Hes incredibly evil it seems unlikely to him that persuading Harry to do that would be impossible. It seems much easier to dissuade Harry than to actually break a law of magic to raise Hermione.When Harry resists Quirrell is forced to resort to Plan B actually resurrect Hermione.

You cant trust a man with no memories at all but knowledge of powerful spells and unconsciously used to solving problems in a violent way with an insane amount of magic power.

Its meant to show how much people and Slytherin house have changed in the years since HPMOR but he is definitely from Slytherin. However like you said its one of those situations where you feel like YOU got something confused which I believe is due to the writing sometimes trying to be too clever. Like at the beginning referring to the Tower and Goddess as evil until we find out who they are was clever. But the writer seems to try and do that same trick quite a bit so you get into a habit of assuming that if something doesnt make sense yet its about to be explained. If you actually missed something though you dont realize it until you are well past it. Makes for difficult reading at times. My hypothesis is the writer is insanely smart and well read but hasnt written much before SD so they are trying to emulate their favorite clever writers and styles. It takes quite a bit of practice to make something smart rich and also easy to read. ,HPMOR,d79thnz,2,t5_2t5xf

How can you possibly prioritise a bad thing that affects a small portion of people and most of them can recover enough to be happy over something that affects all and permanently ends everyones chances to be happy.Maybe from a moral standpoint the former is worse because it involves a conscious choice to harm and thats evil whereas death is something that does not make that choice it just is. But from a utilitarian perspective almost everybody that exists would experience more joy and happiness in their lives living forever than they would living for a short time in a world without rape. There are a small handful who would not but that handful is very small and its irrational in the extreme to prioritise a very small fraction like that.It feels like youre arguing that a dictator murdering thousands is worse because its a human being evil than a natural disaster killing millions.,HPMOR,dcj4yu6,3,t5_2t5xf
