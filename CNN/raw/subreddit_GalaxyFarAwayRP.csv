Death was all that was around him as blaster bolts filled the air red and blue speeding past each other to destroy the intended target or crash helplessly into the ground or crate. Wounded screams and angry shouts faded into the background for Dax. The whirling blade of the lightsaber deflected red bolts of death away from himself and his soldiers. He realized belatedly that while his plan did remove the overwhelming advantage that the droid army held over the republic he had backed himself up into a corner. The minefield did provide a solid defense against the enemies advance but it had also removed possible escape routes. As if on cue the outer minefield erupted sending droid pieces flying into the air and down on the battle. Taking cover behind a crate Dax looked over to a piece of destroyed droid. It was a head and unlike the ones shooting at him this one was much more square and humanoid looking with a piece of singed cloth on top of its head. Concerned Dax reached out through the force and warned his troops to be on the lookout for droids attempting flank their position. He couldnt just assume that they wouldnt try again or that the blast had destroyed all of them. Jumping up Dax once again began his whirling dance of death with the blaster bolts. Deflecting what he could and hardening his resolve when one of his men went down. These were cannon fodder not worth springing the trap just yet. ,GalaxyFarAwayRP,d008td2,1,t5_3b84o
