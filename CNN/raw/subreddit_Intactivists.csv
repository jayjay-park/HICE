More to the point Pride is a celebration of sexbody positivity and a conduit for sexual health information.

2353375,0,t3_2m7g8w,Wow she would actually threaten to divorce you over this? I know you probably wont see this for a while but I just wanted to say Im truly sorry for you. You deserve to be heard not to have everything you say dismissed as something you read on the Internet though where do you think the NP got hisher information?. And Im sorry for your son as hes the only one who will have to deal with the consequences for the rest of his life. When you two calm down I want you to have a calm discussion. No shouting matches no name calling at least on your part. Ask her exactly why the NP suggested circumcison. Once you hear why work with that. This might be a little too academic but there are several tiers of sources of information. She spoke to a medical professional and got an educated opinion nothing more. And even in medical school the only thing I ever learned was there or not no discussion of the anatomy or physiology which Ive heard is quite typical of medical education. You presented academically scrutinized papers in published journals  or you can find plenty in this thread a source that outweighs an opinion in any discipline whether its medicine law business etc. not to say youre already right no matter what but you have the upper hand.You mentioned she knew two or do people who needed to have it done later due to complications. Why not wait until complications happen? Of all the men shes met what percentage had the medical need? And is it worth the risks?Does she want to be changing diapers around a bandage? Does she want to worry about possibly opening a wound? Does she really think that a wet diaper is a great environment for healing to take place? Ill betray my own find in saying this but medicine isnt always as noble as people make it out to be. Some less ethical doctors order tests that arent exactly necessary just to rule out  in  diseases because they can bill for it. Unfortunately circumcison is the same. The delivery is already expensive why not tack an extra few hundred onto it not like theyll notice. Not only that but look up human foreskin on ATCC or another tissue supplier. The hospitals can sell the foreskin fir even more money. Ask your wife if shes okay with her son being exploited for profit.Good luck and I wish you the best in this difficult situation.,Intactivists,cm2l6iq,3,t5_2si5s

4382477,0,t1_csjegtr,Male circumcision in Islam is cultural and not religious. They circumcise because Muhammad was circumcised and its somewhere in another holy book of theirs which details how he lived. For many Muslims that book is some sort of guide for how to live a good life but its not in any way a rulebook just some sort of ideal.From what I know the only major religion where a god demands that the followers be circumcised is Judaism.

4421245,0,t3_3b6ylh,My honest experience is that if people have decided to circumcise they are going to circumcise no matter what. Theyre doing it for their set reasons cultural aesthetics religion and thats typically priority  for them. All of the baby boys except for mine in the family are circumcised and they outright stated those reasons not that I pushed my viewpoint on them. But all of them acknowledged that the procedure is painful or uncomfortable or that they just didnt want to think about it. Most had the attitude of The baby didnt seem that upset so whats the harm?It bothers me to see people making the choice to circumcise. When people ask me why I didnt circumcise I do explain. When people are having kids and they bring up circumcision I mention my choice and make it clear Im there if they have any questions but beyond that I leave it alone.Circumcision is steeped in the western world in more than a century of Its cleaner! its healthier!

5137331,0,t3_3l8qe1,gtHis ground rules The mother doesnt say a word about circumcision to the boy she gets one onehour visit per week and no photography will be allowed during the visits.Okay if this isnt admitting guilt to knowing that circumcision is a bad thing that the boy is ld enough to understand it I dont know what is. Seriously the person who is trying to cut off healthy parts of his boy while keeping him from being told about the plan to have part of his body cut off has sole custody for  of the  hours of every week. This sounds like on of those scifi stories where the child is being raised and prepped to be a ceremonial scarifice and the childs family only gets to visit him on the full moon for an hour. Okay not really. This visitation agreement is  times more generous than that. gtHironimus appeared to be pleased upon signing the agreement totally different from the scene that played out at the same table on May  when she cried and shook while signing a circumcision consent form.If someone can be put in jail then held in handcuffs under threat of more jail until they sign a piece of paper granting consent and it can be valid then any time a man intimidates an unwilling woman into not resisting while he has sex with her it is also consensual. How has this not been reviewed and found  shades of bogus? ,Intactivists,cv58no3,11,t5_2si5s

8115304,0,t3_4qcnza,gtIve been wanting to confront my father for awhile now. Tell him that he really did mutilate me. What youre after is an apology. You want to tell him he wronged you and you want him to acknowledge that and then say he regrets doing it. The thing to remember is that it is not possible to wrangle an apology out of someone that doesnt want to give it. You might get a hollow apology such as Im sorry you feel that way but nothing meaningful. The truth is theres a significant portion of the populace who have never apologized for anything sincerely. My mom falls into this camp and shes not really a bad person. She just doesnt admit fault because shes guarding her ego as best I can tell. Some things you just wont get in life especially when youre dependent on a single person to give them to you. You can have a good life regardless of how your father chooses to act. What youre wanting is for him to show that he loves you enough to listen to you sincerely. And it looks like hes not going to do that for whatever reason.

He replied citing the recent Bossio et al. piece that has been refuted as methodologically and logically flawed. I pointed out that him citing that paper exposed him as a charlatan who clearly does not understand statistics and methodology for if he did he never wouldve cited such an unsound paper to support his argument or worse yet he does understand and is letting his sick ideologies override his scientific and statistical training.
