I plan on also making my own personalcommunity Soundtrack. Although after my PC broke Temporary I learned a great deal amount and will be soon making music for CivEx .. Though with a different approach and much better quality than I had done with Sov.Though if we could have the actual soundtrack in game itd be pretty sweet. Plus it would make this server stand out more imo. Obviously though first wed have to have the soundtrack complete although I have been getting busy lately. Though its just a suggestion whether the ingame music mod would be put in or not. Ill still work on the Soundtrack.,CivEx,d926qco,1,t5_2v9c4

9669520,0,t3_5d7nil,I like your thoughts RedMag.  When I started reading through this my first thought was Expansion pack style content as you stated in one of your comments.  I like the idea of possibly adding in custom adventure maps hell world resource maps new bosses like the dragons that were implemented very late into CivEx etc.I think that for ideas like this to work the lore or aspects of it at least has to be there from the very beginning.  This would mean having ruins and abandoned villages with books containing secrets and clues that lead to discovering these expansions.  The stories and added content could then continue on based on adding more lore and secrets into each progressive expansion.  Continuity would be a non issue.Im all for this kind of stuff!!!  But personally Id rather be able to play.  I would imagine that developers of this content wouldnt be allowed to play in it as they would already have all the information to reach end game in each expansion.,CivEx,da4yynk,1,t5_2v9c4

Myself I consider it on par with great abstract art representatives such as Jackson Pollock or Barnett Newman. This is one of the most dazzling examples of contemporary art. While it may feel as if it lacks any sense or meaning you need to delve deep beneath what you can see at first glance and let your imagination take over. Then you will start seeing intricate shorelines meandering rivers towering forests mountains casting shadows onto valleys on calm spring mornings.

10686206,0,t1_ddi65ps,English in general isnt a very specific language in my eyes. Theres no gender in jobs except in some words actress waitress stewardess and generally in types of people. Obviously I must say that thats a problem in German because theres no word to generally talk about the whole group of people. Like Europeans  Europer Most people will think that it means all Europeans but it can also mean all male Europeans. Whereas Europerinnen only means all female Europeans. German lacks a general word for all genders.And in my specific dialect we dont use a lot of tenses like you mentioned. There are a lot of implications in the everyday speech. Like We are flying to Barcelona. In the context youll clearly see that we are not doing that right now so it can only mean that it will be in the future.On a more positive note English has this great distinction between going to somewhere and walking to somewhere. In English you can go by bus or plane. It implies that you are not controlling said vehicles. In German you fly the plane and drive the bus. It just means that you used the plane or the bus to get to somewhere. There is no information about if you controlled the bus or the plane yourself or if you only were a passenger.,CivEx,ddi7a93,1,t5_2v9c4
