8292980,0,t1_d5e65vj,I could see it being me getting unlucky if this werent the case every single time I queue. Its not normally quite this low of an estimate normally like  seconds but still. It always takes like X as long as it predicts.The extremes thing makes sense though thats probably the case. Its gotten to the point where Ive pretty much given up on queuing and just play vs the bot every now and then but that gets repetitive. Maybe I should start a thread here for finding custom games.,geoarena,d5e6jy1,1,t5_3f63c
8451288,0,t1_d5xwkod,Yup bomber was intended to be more of a zoning utility weapon plus keep in mind that it has the highest splash radius in the game. However  dps really is a bit low well probably end up buffing bomber in the next patch.,geoarena,d5xy49y,2,t5_3f63c
8488725,0,t1_d626fzh,Then what exactly is the difference between armor piercing and extra damage?The way armor works a  armor piercing will always give you the same  bonus damage..  .or if its calculated the other way.  .  .regardless the armor of the target doesnt affect the bonus percent damage from armor piercing. The only reason I could think of to not call it bonus damage was if damage bonuses were additive so armor piercing would be uniquely multiplicative.,geoarena,d62myqw,1,t5_3f63c
8598149,0,t3_4xl9c0,I would love to except Im currently attending DreamHack. So I highly doubt Ill show.,geoarena,d6gd01o,1,t5_3f63c
8607362,0,t3_4xpxbc,You strafe like a goddamn slut. And you lead on your shots better than my exgirlfriend.In all seriousness though the level of skill on display here is incredible. Dodging kiting strafing chasing shooting... Im rank  atm and I know for a fact that youd kick my ass with next to no contest if we went headtohead. Youd probably even wipe the floor with uquasarprintf to be perfectly honest. Mad props to you.,geoarena,d6hikfr,1,t5_3f63c

8715862,0,t1_d6uzonj,I think the issue is the power of the lifesteal upgrades. Though rapid blaster could probably use a damage nerf.,geoarena,d6v4dig,1,t5_3f63c
9725775,0,t3_5eenkp,i agree i play with  ping and its really annoying at times. edit no its really annoyhing ALWAYS !!!that said im not sure if this game has enough money or enough players to actually get better servers.all servers are located in new york atm I,geoarena,dabwygr,1,t5_3f63c
9750020,0,t3_5ernu0,I feel like speed limits are kind of overused as a handicap at this point but I do like the idea of piercing rounds. What if activating this halved your armor and it would stay on a second after releasing? Or something else Im just throwing out ideas. ,geoarena,daewk48,2,t5_3f63c
