11007594,0,t1_defb5ia,Thanks for putting forward the case for the runner  I guess Ill have to reassess my opinion.At the end of the day whilst it has been a long time dream of mine to spend a week doing moderate trails in the CO highcountry the rest of the time the car will be mostly on the highway so the rational choice is for something highway oriented.,ColoradoOffroad,defohll,2,t5_2uuxh
11492131,0,t1_dfyderq,Awesome thanks for the input! Yeah we plan to hit Medano Pass at the very least as it is right next to the dunes. Marshall Pass may be a bit out of the way but good knowing about it. We plan to take the options gathered here and plan a route to see everything we possibly can.,ColoradoOffroad,dfymrdd,1,t5_2uuxh
