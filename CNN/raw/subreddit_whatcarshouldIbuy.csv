178185,0,t1_ceyperw,I found both the Quest and Odyssey very carlike in their drives which is one of the things that helped eliminate any other vans we drove particularly the Sienna.  I cant say I preferred one over the other save that I found the Quests seat to be more comfortable not a knock on the Odyssey the Quest has the nicest and most comfortable interior Ive sat in for a nonluxury car.I havent driven the  yet but the reports Ive read all say that it drives better than any minivan which shouldnt really be surprising given the size difference.  Well see when I drive it.On cost of ownership and reliability Consumer Reports shows the  beating both minivans hands down.  Id be curious to see anything that shows it differently though!The big drawback of the  is certainly cargo room  but with only  kids I just cant imagine that being a deal breaker.  At the moment the cost difference k vs k according to TrueCar and superior cost of ownershipreliability the  wins to me on paper.

In real life on real roads with real people driving them the BMWs feel just as quick.  Also with their dual scroll turbos and virtually no lag Id hazard to say that theyre quicker feeling off the line and down low.  My folks recently got a  ZSdrivei DCT and that car really moves definitely faster on the butt dino than my  STi felt mostly because of power delivery differences.  I know its lighter than a  but Im just saying that numbers dont always have much relevance.  My  Boxster is a torque less wonder down low but pulls like a mother up high.  That would be very hard to describe to a non car enthusiast with numbers and thus simply lends the perception of being slow for the money obviously not what that car is about just making a point.

If there is any way you can postpone your purchase until you have saved up roughly  you will end up saving yourself a lot of grief and hassle and expense. That New Yorker may have low miles but its still a  year old car its unsafe by todays standards and even with low miles there are lots of plastics that have gotten brittle hoses have dry rotted hell even the metal gets more brittle from hotcoldold. The Grand Prix was a decent car once but that one is done. Just too many miles and done them hard. Pass or I see an enginetransmission failure in your near future. Look for an early s VWToyotaHonda with as few miles as possible they will be the cheapest cars to own for the longest time. Preferably get a stick shift even if you have to learn how to drive it.

Yes the MPGs arent great and will add up on the longer trips  hwy with a light foot?. But the upsides are huge. First the size of the car  which means lots of room for you and your crap giant trunk and comfort especially the civilian model for the long road ahead. Second reliability is great and cheap repairs are even better. There arent many complicated systems and so much room under the hood you can wrench just about anything with ease.

Each of them has their advantages but overall Im leaning towards the Mazda not having actually sat or driven in any of them.FIT Most affordable spacious economical. Least favorite in the looks department and weakest of the bunch. This is the SMART choice.M Best blend of price and performancefeatures. Nice interior and electronics best reviews overall. A little pricey if you want the good stuff as you stated you are getting towards GTI pricing.GTI Hot hatch horsepower best looks IMHO. But its pricey has the least cargo space and the VW reliability is questionable.Honestly Im not sure what I want to do either let me know what you end up deciding. ,whatcarshouldIbuy,cisvuko,1,t5_2ys2t
1421953,0,t3_2afgxb,You wont find a better all around hatch than the new Fit IMO. Excellent equipment reliability versatility amp MPG. I would also suggest looking at the Impreza if you dont mind sacrificing MPG amp interior for AWD amp the Fiesta I have heard good things from many on here.

1448287,0,t3_2aqj26,Id got with the Charger specifically the RT Max its a steal for all the tech it has. It does have a AWD option. Id also look at the chrysler s with the dual sun roofs and the tech package. But i dont know why you are looking at these two cars specifically. Why not the Challenger especially with the new one coming out? Why not the infinity or a BMW? Are you trying to buy American? Whats your upper limit what about the Chevy SS? but if i was going to buy a new car itd be a dodge. I have a magnum and dont have any problems with it at k and get mpg with the .v. The new one gets  more horse power and  mpg as you know but thats only  less then the v which really is saying something. Me not having anyone that has to ride back there but i am the one that drives people around Id go for the new challenger the back seat in my magnum has plenty of room they can lose  inches for the Challenger. But IF you want the current Charger act now because they are replacing them soon to i think a uglier exterior with no real improvements to anything else.video on the charger I never took payed too much attention to the SHO after the first big fanfare because they seemed like not enough for that money but I really dont know anything about it. I could look it up but its AWD which means the has the burden of FWD and thats not what i want in a fullsize car specifically because i dont have to settle for that in a fullsize car.  ,whatcarshouldIbuy,cixthd4,0,t5_2ys2t

NADA means nothing at a dealer that will just put it up for auction they arent going to make any profit off of it especially if its in bad condition. Try taking it to Carmax and get ready to be hit with the reality of tradeins. You really sound like you dont know what youre talking about you dont even know what you really want otherwise you wouldnt be comparing a GTI to a Mustang to a Z. What you should be doing is thinking about if X car is DDable in my conditions  does it snow in your region? If yes then a RWD torquey V will not be the best thing. Also how would you know if you like driving a car that handles like its on rails on the trackcanyons but is terrible and uncomfortable on the streets with potholes? The Z Mustang and Camaro will be rough over uneven pavement. Also the Z has no backseats whereas the Mustang and Camaro do. A GTI is going to feel plush and soft compared to these cars and wont be a handful when it snows.If you MUST transport GFDog then toss out the Z. The Genesis will offer  of the Zs driving enjoyment at a cheaper cost and softer suspension. FinallyYou cant just go to a dealer and say I have k and want month car! otherwise theyll rape you and get you into a Sentra. Do some research and please realize that Leases are generally built for people with high credit scores so if you have a mediocre score lt then you will not be able purchase at the advertised rate. With k down and at  max a month you definitely cant get into a Z or GTI  sporty cars also tend to lease worse. I suggest looking at cars with great residuals that are backed by the manufacturer.

Even stock I find it pulls well everywhere.  It has the grunt of a v in the low rpm and when the turbos kick in it pulls. Is it the fastest car in the world? No but I still have not found a car more fun to own in the winter.  Turbos winter tires and a  quattro split with no traction control is an absolute blast.

Trim levels are identical to the T Base Premier and Platinum. There are also allwheeldrive versions of the T as well. There are also DriveE versions which use Volvos new .litrehp turbo engine. However these are rare on the used market and nearly new ones are hard to come by so dont expect big discounts.The topoftherange RDesign gets the .litrehp cylinder turbo.Id suggest going for the S T AWD in either Base or Premier Plus trim.Retail price is  CAD for the T AWD whilst the more upmarket Premier Plus is .Go for the cylinder versions as although theyre a little more expensive to run than the cylinder theyre a little bit quicker and they also offer allwheeldrive traction for the Canadian winters.You can get a good discount on the outgoing model as the new facelifted model with the DriveE engines is coming soon so if you can get a nearly new  or used  model its worth a look.Volvos S might meet your criteria safe and suitable for snow.Also as you said you dont want to pay a fortune unless its worth it in the case of the S it is.

That trans is fine if you dont spend a lot of time in town but clutch wear is high in stop and go.The . is also a much snappier engine to deal with a heavy car. The . sings sweetly but you really need to wind it up to move with any authority. Expect  to  mpg around town and in the low s on the highway.The Skyhook suspension is nice but it can make some odd noises from the bushings now and then. Its very low and long wheelbase. You need to get used to angling in and out of driveways and going very slowly over speed bumps. Stereo is nothing special and the nav system usually picks the scenic route. Cleaning the inside of the back window is a chore due to the angle.We changed the brake pads to Porterfield RS for less dust. bite is similar to stock. We also changed the alignment as well to something a little sportier had our guy in Santa Cruz do that. The downside is a slight tendency to tramline on very rutted pavement but overall its worth it IMHO.The only faults in K miles has been a gas flap button misaligned and not working used emergency cord in trunk and an ABS sensor going out of alignment which turned off stability control and defaulted the suspension to sport which is how I drive it anyway. Its got a little shift flare between nd and rd after a hot start but dealer says its within normal range. There are a limited number of independent shops that service them as the tools are expensive. BR Racing in Los Gatos is one. The dealer in Mill Valley is expensive but seems competent. The one in Redwood City can never hold onto staff and is always backlogged.If you use the dealer the K mileyear service should run around . Fluids filters belts. If you have a warranty it needs to see the dealer. Rear tires are around K and fronts a bit less.Sales of Maserati are exploding. When I got mine over  years ago they were making just  cars a year.

Can you say which of those is more important than the other?My car Mazda  would be excellent for an older person with that type of condition. The seats are up off the floor and its just slightly higher than most cars but much lower than an SUV. Ive never seen a car thats easier to get in and out of. It has plenty of room but its not huge on the outside. The fuel mileage isnt amazing though its a bit better than the xBs real world MPG. I average about  mpg. It has third row seating and sliding doors like a minivan so its great for kids too but its small like an xB not minivan sized at all.  They are phasing them out to focus on SUVs so Mazda dealers will deal on them. I got mine brand new for a little less than k so you might check those out. If the fuel mileage is acceptable I am very confident he would find it comfortable and easy to get in and out of.  Another car you might check out is the Nissan Cube. Its weird looking but its similar to the Scion xB but a bit smaller. It make do a little better on gas.  I think I would also take a look at the Kia Soul.  I am thinking a small crossover would be good for him. Something with a little more room than a compact car that rides just a little higher to be easier to get in and out of.  Hope that was helpful to you and good luck to your grandfather.,whatcarshouldIbuy,cl9gtbp,1,t5_2ys2t

Water pumps are known to be a problem as you get closer to k but the cost isnt outrageous.  The big plus for the mazda is that it is naturally aspirated.  Pretty much all direct injected turbo engines can have carbon buildup issues which require cleaning the intakes every k miles.  Not terribly expensivefigure  but certainly an advantage to the Mazda.  When I had my mazda the car was very reliable but parts were not cheapmore expensive than ToyotaHonda similar in cost to Euro cars.  I would test drive it and look into prior years on the Golf to see how the reliability fares compared to the rest of the brand.  Always look into reliability on a model by model basis not just the brand.  I can tell you that I recently test drove both the Mazda and the GTI.  The mazda interior starts to look nice once you load it up in options.  However I found the price to be very close or higher than the GTI.  If I were choosing between a Mazda dr and a VW Golf TSI Id favor the Mazda.  If you start to load up the options on the Mazdai.e. S Grand Touring than the GTI or a loaded Golf makes more sense.  Both cars have similarly great steering but I do not love the skyactiv .L in the Mazda and would prefer either the .T or .T.

Heres a video of a test performed by tirerack.com comparing allseasons to winter tires.  This test does not include the AWD variable though  Heres an approximate comparison based on my personal experienceAcceleration  On snow a FWD car with good winter tires and a similar AWD car with good winter tires can accelerate at about the same pace. Exact results depend on exactly what cars youre comparing and what tires theyre wearing.Braking  AWD makes no difference.  All cars have all wheel braking.  Winter tires have an enormous advantage.Cornering  AWD can help in cornering under certain conditions if you dont mind a bit of oversteer.  Winter tires still have a massive advantage.Note that I call them winter tires not snow tires.  Winter tires will typically outperform all seasons whenever its below around  degrees F even if the roads are totally dry.  However winter tires will also get very soft and wear quickly if you use them in the summer.  If you have adequate storage space its really best to have two sets of tires and switch them out with the seasons.

2934780,0,t3_2tqiqz,Mazda CX.Have the SUV and AWD part for the snow and the sporty handling and  mpg of a small car.  To be honest the Prius C and the Wrangler are both two of the worst vehicles in their respective classes I hate to say it. The Prius C is Yaris based and incredibly tiny inside and you are paying A LOT for that hybrid drivetrain in what is essentially a Yaris and its even slower than a regular Yaris. The Jeep Wrangler seems cool and all and if you are rock crawling in Utah it is but when you get it on the highway and are using it as a daily driver in an urban environment it sucks. The steering has a lot of play and is overboosted it doesnt handle well the short wheelbase gives you a choppy ride the fit and finish and reliability are nowhere near as good as the Japanese brands. It also gets terrible fuel economy. Its basically rife with compromises as a daily driver and they are only worth putting up with if you are honestly going to be doing hardcore offroad stunts with it. If you want a small efficient car the Honda Fit is one of the best. You might also look at the Mazda  which is a whole class larger than the Fit but still gets  mpg highway.If you want a small SUV and you are not going to be winching yourself up clifffaces and doing extreme hardcore stuff then get one of the carbased small CUV type vehicles with car like handling and ride. Mazda CX Toyota RAV Subaru Forester or Crosstrek. These are what you should be looking at. ,whatcarshouldIbuy,co1p3dp,2,t5_2ys2t

Now we have something to work with.Just a note about old Corvettes they are pretty reliable and easy to find parts for. If you are discounting them because they wont be able to be driven as much as a  or a WRX that isnt a good reason. If its because you dont like them then I understand completely.I will be the first to admit that Japanese mods arent in my wheelhouse but you said in your OP that you dont want to spend a lot of money on this car in case you mess something up. A turbo vehicle is VERY unforgiving. They have things like intercoolers wastegates flash mods to modify the computers etc. and if you modify or replace the turbo you might have to replace the pistons with lower compression ones andor forged ones to keep the engine from grenading. If I was getting into modding as a novice I would consider maybe an older Civic Si or RSX Type S and start with some suspension work. Maybe do some porting and polishing of the head and replace the timing belt and water pump while its torn down and look into an upgraded throttle body and cold air intake. Do some exhaust work and I dont mean sticking some stupid coffee can exhaust pipe on it. Really get a feel for wrenching your own car before stepping up to a zx twin turbo or a WRX.

4639241,0,t3_3eibuu,Okay well lets start with the RX.Wankels are very special creatures.  They need to be treated well and by design have much less forgiving maintenance requirements.That being said people on this site like to make rotary engines out to be complete disasters.  Everyone says your apex seals will fail and its a costly repair.  Yeah I mean that is true apex seals will eventually fail and then engine will stop producing power.  However everyone makes it seem like apex seals fail between every oil change.  This isnt true.   I tend to estimate the life of apex seals at  miles.  Give or take depends on how good you and previous owners are at maintenance.Most people dont understand that apex seals are wear items.  People dont go around and shouting stay away from manual transmissions their clutches fail.  Clutches are wear items too.  Apex seals typically dont last as long as clutches though and poor maintenance takes a serious toll on their life span.  Similarly pistons are not wear items.  You should not expect to replace pistons in the lifespan of your car.  If you go into owning a wankel with the same mentality youre going to have a rough time because apex seals were never designed with the intention of never failing,whatcarshouldIbuy,ctfcdyt,3,t5_2ys2t

You are carrying a lot of stuff a long way  anything above  on the highway is pretty good. And your price range is going to get you much more value used than new.Have you considered a Prius? I dont usually recommend them but as a midsize hatchback with good reliability it meets your criteria better than a lot of the cars mentioned in this thread.Have you considered a used fullsize sedan? For something like a  Toyota Avalon the reliability is there the price is there the back seat room is there and while the city MPG is not there the highway MPG is much better.A  Venza would be out of your price range a little but might be the right car.A used Ford Taurus from  or so might be a better pick for fitting car seats.,whatcarshouldIbuy,cw0p92r,4,t5_2ys2t

5853917,0,t3_3vds44,The order Id go with would be Golf Mazda Impreza. The Golf is the most comfortable and upscale of the three and that .t engine is a honey. People here love to poop all over VW but the fact of the matter is Ive had nothing but good experiences with Volkswagen. Youll also be able to get a pretty fantastic deal on one right now. VW cant give them away fast enough. I know from experience that Golfs can do very well in snow.The Mazda is also pretty fun to drive comfortable and my sister in law loves hers. Interiors are very nice looking compared to almost every other Japanese make out there and the cars handle well. The only downside is that they are a bit down on power but they get fantastic gas mileage. Skyactiv is for real.  The Impreza has only one real benefit in that its AWD but considering you live in Southern CA you wont need the advantages of an AWD car  of the time and youll feel the drawbacks of the AWD pretty poor gas mileage much more. Also Subaru doesnt really know how to make a good interior. Back when they made super utilitarian weather band radio toting Paul Hoganmobiles their spartan interior worked for them but theyve moved past that into the realm of beige and CVTs.

I would be careful might be okbut they took the plates off for the picswhich seems oddand the price is a little to low which worries me.I would try to get either  or but also get the vin and have it checked.If they both check back fine get which ever you can get cheaper.But the  is a little bit better.,whatcarshouldIbuy,cy185re,3,t5_2ys2t

6931305,0,t1_d11xab2,Weirdly enough if youre talking about new trucks the Silverado and the Tacoma get about the same gas mileage despite the difference in size  vs  for the base models. This is because the Tacomas design is a little bit behind the times in terms of fuel economy  they dont change it much  and because theyve taken so much weight out of the full size trucks in the recent generations and so much of fuel economy is wind resistance which both midsize and fullsize trucks do about equally well.The Chevy Colorado gets a bit better gas mileage at  and  for the diesel. I agree with your recommendation. The Chevy I think is a bit more of a comfortable place to sit feels a bit more like a car and the Tacoma to me feels a bit more cramped if I dont actually need the truck bed.

8035979,0,t3_4pa9ef,How big is your dog? I put my bernese mountain dog in the back seats of my Ecoboost Mustang all the time. He climbs over the front seats to get out though. The power is good but not anywhere near the GT. I get  mpg average but my commute is  freeway. If you can afford the premium GT I would go with that. I hated the looked of the nonpremium mustang interiors but if you dont care about the larger screen dual climate leather vent and heated seat extra speakers with amp fog lights... You can see where I am going here. They lumped a ton of stuff into the premium trim levels. I got caught at the point where I could get a premium Eco for .k or a base GT for k and went premium Eco. It was a good decision IMO. The Eco has serious power for a daily driver. I have out down a .s  on a random back road with my automatic no Performance Pack. Thats not nearly as good as the GT can do but I have rarely found anywhere that I can even begin to apply that much power in daily driving. Even moderate use of the throttle leaves most traffic in the rear view mirror. The cornering isnt as good as what youll get with a BMW or FRS but if you live away from twisty roads like I do PowergtCornering. Not to say the Eco is bad in corners either you just notice the size of the car. Ive put .g on a corner according to the track app in my car. Overall its a pretty amazing car for the money. Great for daily driving especially if you are on freeways a lot. The back seat is essentially a dog bed. Premium trim is well worth it in my opinion. If your discount is really good or if you have the money I would look GT just for the extra power. It is a big leap in cost though and dont be surprised when even a GT with zero options is more expensive than a premium performance pack Eco on lots.,whatcarshouldIbuy,d4jbi9v,2,t5_2ys2t

The focus was my first car and served me very well until I gave it to my goddaughter and now she serves her well. I enjoy hatchbacks for the trunk space because Im a caregiver and often have to go on giant shopping trips. The gas mileage is obviously awesome  about mpg. I also have a  jeep Cherokee laredo with a inline  engine which does decent gas mileage for a suv avg about mpg hwy is very comfortable amp roomy and its a freaking jeep. The i engine is known for having a ridiculously long life and can easily make it past k with proper maintenance  some people have gotten k out of their is. Theres also the utility that comes with owning a jeep  Ive moved myself using just a jeep friend had the same jeep older year before I got mine twice theres lots of space once you put the seats down. My husband and I decided to invest in the jeep so we could stop blowing off the belt on the focus whenever we went on hikes that had gravel roads lol. We also wanted it for when we have kids because of the space.My parents recently got a  Toyota rav and they really like it amp it has awd. They are also leasing it for about mo your rate will depend on your credit obviously. The downside to leasing is that you can get in trouble for letting other people drive your car your car isnt really yours and youre responsible for wear amp tear. On the upside you get to drive a newer car the monthly payments are lower and you may experience lower repair costs. Cant say Im a huge fan  but thats because Ive got my jeep that I like to tinker with. Whether to lease or not really depends on if you prefer having complete ownership of your car so you can do things like install aftermarket accessories amp stickers etc or if youre fine with trading in your car every few years. If youve been driving older models your whole life you might also suffer from technological overload by jumping from an early s car or older straight into some of the newest models. My parents are having a very difficult time understanding their new car  I have a difficult time as well and Im a yo that is immersed in technology. Its because weve always driven older cars and skipped about  years of gradual introduction to all this new car tech.Husband drives a Subaru impreza. He loves his Subaru for the awd a bunch of other technical things. If you want a decent family car that has awd and good gas mileage check out a subaru forester or legacy. ,whatcarshouldIbuy,d5i90hc,3,t5_2ys2t

9344187,0,t3_57o5wy,I have a  Volt and I love it.   per day to charge is a lot.  At home it costs me just over  per day by my calculations. Even at  per day though driving electric is awesome.  Rarely need an oil change most of my trips are under  miles so the engine is rarely running brake pads will last forever regen slows the car spark plugs also.  Also the Volt is fun to drive.  Handles well kind of quick acceleration compared to most  cylinders and best of all  no engine noise except for long trips.  The great thing about the Volt is the ability to keep running on gas if youre going farther than the battery will take you.  Tesla Nissan Leaf etc. dont have that capability.And also used Volts are a good value right now.  I swore Id never own another GM product as of  so I had Toyotas for awhile after that.

10660024,0,t3_5sh567,I had a  V Mustang and loved it. A set of winter tyres kept it useful during the snowy months too. The worst parts about the interior were the fake leather and the stereo. The stereo was easy to sort out as it was a double din slot. I wish it was a V though but being manual and RWD made it so fun in its own right. I was lucky enough to take a similar vintage Aston Martin V Vantage out for a weekend and apart from the beautiful leather amazing build quality sorted chassis and lovely power delivery and outrageous exhaust note it felt kind of similar to the Mustang. However the standard stereo in that was shitty too!  Any economy car or Pontiac G bloody  is going to be an utter disappointment. Its GTOG or bust when it comes to that era of GM.

That is a pretty good price for a car that should have almost no running costs for the first few years outside of oil. It is also a lower trim however and this is one year before the refresh in  where there are big exterior and interior differences. I would recommend the  Mazda  due to the cheaper running costs assuming the manual is OK although it wont be as luxurious as the TSXobviously. Another option would be to look for a  Mazda  with maybe k miles  you should be able to find one for about k  and it will offer similar build quality and pseudoluxury to the tsx while getting mpg highway. ,whatcarshouldIbuy,ddhgq1v,5,t5_2ys2t

I drive a lowered BMW with some spendy coilovers and if I wanted to covert my suspension back to stock I could probably make some money along the way selling my coilovers on Craigslist or something. Are the aftermarket components made by a reputable manufacturer? Are they in good condition? How modified is the suspension? Basically its impossible to know exactly how much either things will cost.

11800146,0,t3_68cmmf,Ive spent more hours on this very same dilemma than I care to admit though I was looking at a new MT  GTI Sport LSD HID Golf R brakes etc because theyre so damn cheap now dealers in my area are asking k for a new one on a k MSRP.As you know the most important thing to have if youre driving in snow is proper winter tires not AWD. Also the AWD system in the R is haldexbased so it only comes on when slip is detected and is otherwise a FWD car with extra weight of the AWD drivetrain. That said theres something a bit more bespoke about that car than the GTI. It puts the power down quite well and has a lot of beefier components from the start that the GTI doesnt have K turbo bigger IC forged internals etc. if you plan on modding. Reliability is actually pretty good and the primary issues are well documented e.g. cam follower and easy to address with proper maintenance. I wouldnt be scared away and the one youve found sounds like its reasonably priced though I was looking at a sorted  R with k miles for  clean carfax APR Stage  tune already installed.The MK GTIs are overall more refined than the R from handling to interior. Its a better car on paper and if youre into making power the GTI responds exceptionally well thanks to the addition of new valve timing and a bigger turbo. It does a soso job putting the power down with the LSD but youre going to be fighting for traction below  mph if you tune it. The car feels quick even in stock form much faster than youd expect. Where the GTI falls short compared to the R is uniqueness putting the power down and resale value. Where it oneups the R is overall refinement electronic gadgets if youre into that modding potential and warranty though its moot if youre going to mod. For me I felt that both cars fell short when it came to something that offered a true purposebuilt analog raw feel. Coming from an  ZM roadster neither the R or GTI could compare in that regard.
