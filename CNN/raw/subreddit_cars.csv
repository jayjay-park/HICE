2955,0,t3_1u5avn,so heres how tire math works.First number  the width of the tread of the tire in mm. In your case the manufacturer specs a mmwide tread of the tire.Second number  aspect ratio of the sidewall or the percentage of tread width the sidewall is. In your case the sidewall is .  mmtall sidewall.Third number  the diameter of the hole for the wheel in essence.So to calculate the total height of the tire simply take the sidewall height m double it for having both the top and bottom sidewall mm and then convert to inches . and then add the wheel height .Then you just need to duplicate the math for your new tire. .   mm or . for a total height of .. So in terms of tire height your car will sit . lower in the rear and if your speedometer reads off rear wheel speed it will be off by about   or when your speedo says youre going  youll actually be going .As far as section width youre losing mm of contact patch per side which overall will slightly decrease your maximum rear grip relative to your front grip assuming you only replace the fronts. ,cars,ceervzy,3,t5_2qhl2

16356,0,t3_1ub24e,Keep in mind the MPGs based on EPA estiamtes are only about  better on the V compared to the V fueleconony.gov shows that you will spent  per year on gasoline for the V and  per year on the V. Which means about  per month more on gasoline. Figure in that since the Challenger is heavy you probably will be footing it a lot to get up to speed which will use more fuel and lower your average. Also resale value is lesser on a V challenger. When the day comes for trade in or private party resale you will take a few thousand dollar hit because very few people want a V Challenger so it will have to be sold for cheap so there is your fuel savings that you wanted gone during the trade inresale process. Drive both get in a V and get in a V Challenger and see which one feels better I am willing to bet that you will want the V one afterwards. It is that much better of a choice. Also the V makes all of its power when you rev the pants out of it where as the V is a grunter making all of its torque right off of the line. The driving experience between the V and V is hugely different. But if thats what you want then go for it. To me buying a V muscle car is about the same as dating a super model for her brain and not her looks. ,cars,cegao1a,4,t5_2qhl2

83210,0,t3_1v1tjx,High NOx is due to the combustion if the air and fuel mixture being  too hot. Typically NOx is produced at  degrees F. There are a handful of ways that this could be caused Lean airfuel mixture this causes the cylinders to get hot. By lowering the amount of fuel or increasing the amount of air in the mixture he temperature in the cylinders increases. Defective Faulty EGR system the EGR system is designed to recirculate spent exhaust gases through the engine and the cylinders to lower the temp of the combustion.  Carbon deposits on the valves or cylinders. The carbon deposits will retain heat and get extremely hot. This will cause the cylinder temp to increase.If you take it to a mechanic I would bring the smog sheet with you. Any mechanic worth his salt will be able to diagnose it with the  gas analysis. I would start by checking the EGR function then pull the EGR valve and check the ports for excess carbon build up. If there is an excess of carbon there are a few ways to clear it out. You can drill it out or you can run some water or seafom through a vacuum line this will clean off the backs of the valves and the tops of the pistons.

If so Ill edit my original comment.,cars,cevg9fi,2,t5_2qhl2

158636,0,t1_cewhjwr,See my other commentbutgtThere is no other way to have a disparity in steering wheel input vs turn radius.I really am happy to take a videoyou can have natural understeer or natural oversteer im sure i can find a load of articles on the matter too?gtOtherwise the car and the road are mechanically linked meaning that the car turns exactly as you steer it.yes but with the suspension geometries depending on the setup the car can oversteer or understeer by a couple of degrees without traction loss.. through castorcamberraketoe.. and even things like roll center etc. etc. etc... the amount of available grip and slip angle are all products of this as well as drive layout.How much about suspension dynamics in particular do you know about? I dont mean purely from a mathematical engineering standpoint but actually how it works in a car.I know ive barely scratched the surface in real world terms and to get any further i actually need to build an alignment rig to fiddle withED though even in a car with natural oversteer you can get it to show understeer in a tight turn radius of course..,cars,cewi29v,1,t5_2qhl2

166710,0,t1_cexef0f,The most difficult part is removing the transmission.I will assume your Amigo is similar to my Miata.  Once you have everything out you take off the flywheel and have it resurfaced or get a new one after removing the old pressure plate by taking out the bolts. Youll get a pilot bearing with the clutch that goes in the center of the flywheel. This aligns with the input shaft from the trans. The old bearing can be carefully removed using a socket and a hammer. You need to get the new one in. Mine was really tight but most of the time they press in without the use of sophisticated tools. In the event yours is tight too put the bearing in the freezer so it shrinks just a little bit. This will make it easier to install into the flywheel.Once you have the flywheel and pilot bearing done you mount up the flywheel to the crank using a star pattern when tightening the bolts to ensure equal torque and then position the clutch alignment tool into the center of the bearing. Then you slip the clutch disk over the tool and use it as a guide to center the disk. From there you attach the pressure plate to the flywheel with bolts using a star pattern to ensure equal torque all around. Then you can remove the alignment tool and mount everything back up using the new throw out bearing on the clutch fork lever. I did this as part of an engine swap this summer. Main concern is realigning the transmission and just getting everything back to normal. Depending on working location tools help and experience this job can vary from  or so hours all the way up to well over a full days work. Remember that nothing ever goes right in the garage and plan for extra time and needing additional parts like a flywheel or rear main seal. Also use red thread locker on those flywheel and pressure plate bolts to prevent costly repairs down the road.,cars,cexf6g4,1,t5_2qhl2

168843,0,t1_cexi0x9,Yea I know I always thought it was weird. I dont ever think it was issues with the engine though I think it was just bits and bobs going wrong. I wouldnt let that stop you though simply because any one in good shape out there now has probably been fixed fine and shouldnt have too many issues. The right tires will help but it wont compare to AWD in the snow. Plus the torque curve on the GTO might make it a little difficult to be gentle in snow driving. Edit Upon research the issues with the GTO that got them lemoned are stupid. Oversized tire recall fromGM and excessive burning of oil but I always thought that was just what an LS did. ,cars,cexnxih,1,t5_2qhl2

A    civic cx is the lowest model but one of the most sought after because its the lightest. With full interior and everything it weighs lbs. As for condition around my area while it sucks that people dont build all around cars they generally put all their money into the motor set up. So youll see a rusted out dented up honda but theres still a good chance its an  second car. Generally the guys that run s or better do care a bit more about appearance. ,cars,cf2rizb,1,t5_2qhl2

This causes the vehicle to steer more tightly into the turn hence oversteering. In other words easing off the accelerator can cause the rear tires to lose traction with the potential for the car to leave the road tail first.gtgtImage iInteresting Porsche  | Swing axle | Chevrolet Corvair | Lancia Trevi uDandyHands can reply with delete.

It works by arranging for fuel and air to be in the exhaust duct after the engine and before the turbocharger. This ignites in the hot ducting and the combustion process that occurs there keeps the turbocharger spinning when the engine is not delivering enough exhaust gas.gtInteresting Turbocharger | World Rally Championship | Ford World Rally Team uThirdCocacola can delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecfdtl.

The number of crashes per million vehiclemiles traveled increased by more than  the year after reasonable and prudent went into effect. It did decline somewhat after the initial spike but the crash rate did not drop to mid s levels until numerical speed limits were reinstated in . While median speeds did not increase all that much a small number of irresponsible idiots took the Basic Rule as a license to drive at warp speed at all times usually in unmaintained crap cans. Im all for high speed roads but we just dont have the driver training or vehicle inspections in place to do it safely. As always a small number of morons ruin it for everyone else. Crashes aside the Basic Rule wasnt all it was cracked up to be. There was too much inconsistency in enforcement. One officer may prefer to start ticketing at  while another might ticket at . I believe that the guy who ended up taking a too fast for conditions ticket to the state supreme court had been cited for doing about  mph in a rainstorm. Contrary to what many people believe the federal government had nothing to do with the repeal of the Basic Rule. The law tying federal highway funding to speed limits was done away with in . This may change soon as NHTSA is using the zero fatalities initiative as a backdoor method for instituting just about anything they want the states to do.

355034,0,t1_cfhh7pb,gt  So while the  liter motor makes more power than the  liter one it doesnt make a full x as much power.Not from the factory anyway. To everyone else reading this  cyl engines are built far closer to their volumetric efficiency than Vs. With a NA sub .L cyl I would wager that you would hard pressed to exceed bhp. Vs are very restricted from the factory to strike a balance of powermpg.People have been as high as  wheel horsepower  which is closer to bhp  on sub cu Vs without Forced Induction or Nitrous and a stock bottom end. Throw some Forced Induction on there and hp isnt that far off. You may have to give the engine a little bit more displacement but theres a guy well known in the GM crowd as Flash who has a car with whp out of a cu  GM HighTech magazine guessed his car at bhp . The engine in his car came stock with .Just a simple Camshaft swap can net you upwards of bhp in a V. A NA cyl wont get nearly that much power from the same mod.Forced Induction throws a wrench into the whole volumetric efficiency thing.,cars,cfhkdug,3,t5_2qhl2

Look at the way fuel grades are marketed theres nothing inherently premium about high octane fuel other than the higher concentration of octaneratingboosting additives. But its sold as premium and countless people insist that its not just more knockresistant in a highcompression engine but somehow better otherwise.While there are vehicles for which  AKI is the spec minimum fuel grade Id bet the majority of  AKI fuel purchased comes down to an old marketing technique where if presented with three options at graduated price points many people will subconsciously favor the midgrade option discounting the lower priced item as inadequate and the higher priced item as too extravagant.Given that most  AKI fuel is literally a  mix of  and  but usually priced smack in the middle you can see the profit pootential there for the refiner.,cars,cfihm06,12,t5_2qhl2

433404,0,t1_cfplq3x,Carb cleaner is a compressed solution its not water based and wont hurt your engine to burn a little of it in fact it will if anything suffocate or richen the mixture of fuel that gets in the idea is if you have a vacuum leak at the intake manifold or around the piping past the mass air flow meter this is known as unmetered air it will cause lean fuel mixture and the engine computer wont know why or be able to compensate for it causing stalling rough idle loss of power etc... It sprays out similar to the way a can of wasp be gone will do or a can of Resolve carpet cleaner the kind in an aerosol can. whatever you spray out should just evaporate within a few minutes so it wont make a mess. Your tune up if it was a while ago and you used copper plugs like you seem to suggest copper plugs while allowing for better spark should be changed every year they wear out extremely fast and its the sole reason why most tuners or NA V guys will run them because they work better for high power applications and because they just replace them every year the same goes for a spark plug in a lawnmower engine or a jet ski they usually have copper plugs which allow for a lot of spark but they just dont last very long. The reason why most car companies use Platinum or Double Platnium is the rare service interval most companies claim about K miles before needing to be replaced. Iridium plugs are much of the same but they usually are designed for being used in a car with Forced Induction TurboSupercharger.It sucks to find a shop that will give someone a run around its easy to find one that will as well especially if you know a thing or two about cars and what has been recently replaced. Here is a silly thing you can try that will help weed out spark related issues wait till the gas tank is nearly empty fill it with a full tank of premium gas if the issue subsides or becomes a lot less frequent you might have found your issue to be spark related which would indicate an ignition coil spark plug wires or plugs usually changing all three is the best route to go but if you are getting a misfire you would have a flashing check engine light on the dashboard. Lets consider another possibility Timing belt when was it changed last? a worn belt or bad tensioner might be causing slack in the belt which could knocking the timing off a degree although this issue would be constant and not intermittent my theory is with vacuum leaks or misfires. It could also be a fuel delivery issue does it happen when the car is low on fuel most frequently? If you fill it up does the problem seem to go away?You might be stuck at trying to find a shop that wont throw you for a loop I almost hate to say it but maybe find a well reviewed dealership but that could end up costing big money check yelp reviews in your area. Another easy test is to do a Compression Test since these engines were known for valve issues this right here will at least help determine the health of the pistons and the valves if the compression is low then there is your answer right there time for a head rebuild. ,cars,cfpoqwi,1,t5_2qhl2

Some people park in neutral when on a flat surface on the logic that the transmission wont be damaged if the car is hit while its parked. In my opinion if the car gets hit hard enough to move it back a few feet youre probably fucked anyway.The best way to park IMO is in reverse or st with the brake set that way if the brake fails the car wont roll away. Now that I have a weekend car that sits for several weeks at a time I just leave it in gear without setting the brake I figure theres no reason to try and bond the parking shoes to the hub over long periods of time but if I left it in neutral someone would probably lean on it and roll it into the garage door.There are a lot of cars that wont even give you the key back unless its in gear.

Follow exhaust from exhaust manifolds down to catalytic converters to Hpipe and down towards  axleback where mufflers sit to see if anything has been changed e.g. headers tubes instead of a cast manifold.

I saw the same reaction happen with the FRS with the past three generations of Mustang... concept cars are not grounded in reality.

The total number of fire incidences in gasoline cars was taken from the  data. By combining the two data sets I showed a conservative assumption of fire incidence based on a rate of component degradation greater than anything seen in modern cars and the results still show a lower incidence of vehicle fire among Teslas than comparable new gasoline vehicles. If you dont like the  fire distribution data feel free to find a newer data set which will show less component degradation and a greater weighting of fire instances as reported by NFPA attributed to newer vehicles.Your argument doesnt make any sense in the context of the data sets I linked so I can only assume you somehow didnt understand my earlier post.

Its a pretty solid car all around. But in all honesty you cant go wrong with either one. Since you live in downtown Chicago you may not get the same enjoyment out of the manual trans that am I getting. I commute to Rockford so I get to exercise my car everyday.

667742,0,t1_cgg5j41,Im . Ive owned more than a few v cars. I said my heavily ALTERED Ford Focus was faster than a stock LS powered F body and it is. Not by much but it is. Thats why I said stock because with so much as a cat back Id be in trouble. Am I proud of this? God damn right I am. My econobox disappears in traffic but has the goods when I need them and without the crap insurance premiums to go with it. You fucking GM nuts are the saddest lot Ive ever come across. Worse than the Honda guys. All mouth and then if you lose oh more mouth. Ive never seen different and youre not proving me wrong. Far from mad Im amused at your vitriol I only wish it could be in person but unfortunately Im not a teenager so all I get is stuck at home talking trash online. At least I can admit it.Just to reiterate all the JDM  vtec yo crap means NOTHING to me as a Focus owner. If you knew a goddamn thing about car culture youd know that.

The majority of the energy absorbed in a crash is by the body and frame of the car rather than your rather more fragile skin bones and internal organs.In other words this is how its supposed to work.

733405,1,t1_cgnmgru,gt Teslas update bricked the car but the reason the car bricked is because of the modifications the individual was informed could lead to the car bricking and therefore voids warrantyFrom a legal standpoint though it isnt that clear And has never been tested in court. MagnusonMoss permits an owner to mod a car and have the warranty stand provided that the changes they make dont directly cause the damage. It seems reasonable that a lawyer could at least make the case that it was Teslas changes that caused the issue as the modifications that the owner made left the car in a usable state and without Teslas interference wouldnt have caused any damage. Im not saying the case would get up but its not totally without legal merit. Hence why I still believe its a murky area. ,cars,cgnn4jg,-1,t5_2qhl2

They extend the construction area considerably further than they are actually working or planning to work that day.  A  mile construction area turns into a  mile reduced speed zone. . They seem to frequently set up construction zones when no construction is taking place at all even weeks in advance. . Although Ive noticed less of its use the worthless Resume Legal Speed sign after a construction zone is utter crap.  How would I know if the speed after the zone is the same as when I entered it?So I can understand why very few bother with the work speed limits.   However being paranoid I usually go the posted speed anyway the standard  maybe all the way through especially close when I see actual workers and equipment.,cars,cgo04ar,3,t5_2qhl2

754700,0,t3_22syb6,So the story is that about two months ago I bought a new  Corvette Stingray z from a local dealership.  It was a spur of the moment purchase.  I bought it the day they took it off the truck.  Thats how much I liked it.  Its got all the bells and whistles except for one the mag suspension.Fast forward a month and change and I had just grown tired of the design.  Mine was yellow...bad choice.  It had already been serviced  times for various small issues.  Car had a bad case of orange peel and the interior smells bad...real bad.  I have no idea why.Its a great car but not as fast as advertised.   times of . sec?!  Yeah no way.  Best I was able to get is . sec.  Not that bad though.  Pretty peppy but the rear end breaks loose all to hell.  I was so tired of losing traction.  Its a hell of a torque machine but I think they missed an opportunity to use wider tires that are less all seasonal and more track ready.  Minor gripes though all around.  The interior of the Vette is very nice but not Mercedes or Porsche nice.  Definitely not Aston Martin nice.When I put my name on the list for purchasing one of the new zs to come out next year is when I decided to start looking around for something else.  Luck would have it that on a Corvette forum I heard about the Viper plant shutting down.  They cant sell the Vipers.  They are overpriced and many feel not as track efficient as the Vette with z package.  I started putting out feelers and quickly learned that many new  and  Vipers are on lots across the US and arent being sold.  I managed to get an amazing deal on a Viper.  Over  off the Viper a brand new  model.  It gets delivered early next week to my house. horsepower and  torque.  Standard model with better tires upgraded suspension and better brakes coming up.  So excited.  ,cars,cgq2e1c,-18,t5_2qhl2

I think as car enthusiasts we care too much about Horse Power and quarter mile times and not so much on what makes a luxury vehicle...a luxury vehicle. I think the RLX provides a great alternative to a  seriesE ClassLexus GS. If a car owner wishes to get reliable fuel economic luxury vehicle the RLX is for them.Same goes for an ILX. People do scoff at it for being a dressed up SI but in Canada the price difference between an SI and a ILX is merely . And for that you get a great entry level luxury  seater with a decent engine and fuel economy. In fact when shopping for a replacement for our  series we did in fact almost purchase an ILX however due to Acura not being able to provide us one in the colourtrim we wanted stopped the deal which is another issue entirely.And I still hold out hope for the NSX. The first one was amazing and the current CEO of Honda was the Chief Engineer for the NSX iirc. I have hopes he would not let the new one fall. In all honesty I do hold bias with Acuras I myself drive a DC and my dad has owned an RL as well as Odyssey in the past so take my ramblings with a grain of salt.

Recaro bucket seats with manual adjustments come standard and the driver is treated to a flatbottomed multifunction steering wheel.The instrument cluster consists of four analog gauges separated in two pods and a TFT screen in between them. The car is designed to be as light as possible so there is no infotainment system to be found but a simple AMFMCD audio unit connected to a single speaker is mounted on the center console. Bluetooth connectivity enables the driver to make handsfree calls.The Z is almost  pounds lighter than a Camaro ZL thanks to weightsaving modifications such as a thinner rear window and a smaller LN battery.

The only problem with Subaru is that their engines are mounted really far down to lower the center of mass which improves handling but sucks when you have to fix something in the engine which then becomes expensive. To be fair though Subaru engines can take a beating so theyre not likely to need service often. If you want fair price then absolutely get a small Japanese car. The cars that I have seen take a beating are late s Accords late s Camry any sentra any corolla and of course Civics. Hope this helped,cars,ch7okmn,1,t5_2qhl2

914258,0,t3_24l5h5,As a tow truck driver who changes multiple tires every day my advice is to use the factory jack points with your floor jack. I say this because if I damage the vehicle it comes out of my pocket so I have tons of reason to be paranoid. Now when Im on the side of the road I dont have the time to use stands but when working on my own free time you always use stands. So use the jack to lift it. Then get stands underneath a solid part of the car. You can also use an axle differential frame rail or anything underneath the car that wont bend or puncture easily to lift it. Dont put the jack under any brake fuel or electrical lines. Put the stands underneath an axle or frame rail. Unibody cars do have frame rails even though they dont have a frame like a truck does. These frame rails are what we hook our recovery hooks to when winching cars up onto our trucks. ,cars,ch87gss,11,t5_2qhl2

Plus with a v and a bunch of random problems makes it both fast fun and funny.The fact that it was a biohazard reminds me of this really cheap camaro I saw a while back. You could literally tell that someone was killed in the back seat.Sadly my car lacks that st car character. It is fast enough for me and it is comfortable enough for me is extremely reliable...but thats it. It doesnt have anything that makes it super fun.Well actually it does have one thing. If I accelerate in a weird way the traction control messes up. After that the car kicks and accelerates like crazy launching the car forward with both up and downshifts. Along with the acceleration the revs go up fast as well.Scary as hell though sometimes. One time I downshifted on the freeway at like  miles per hour and it lurched forward with a bang. It felt like a car hit me from the back. When I look at how high the revs went it was at  rpm and within a split second took my foot of the pedal and put it back on drive.

937235,0,t3_24u7dq,  thing to do before you attempt to turn it over is to inspect the belts. If a belt breaks on one of these bad boys then your motor is pretty much ruined. Change the belts and rollers immediately. I recommend doing it yourself because having a shop do it will cost over .  Once you get that all sorted out then you have to check the fuel system. The injectors are probably full of gunk. Easily fixed by tapping on them while you try to start the car and then running some injector cleaner through them. I have a  S it has the same drivetrain as a  and the sound a .L four cylinder makes is pretty special. Check out ClarksGarage.com and have a look at the garage shop manual.,cars,chathlw,10,t5_2qhl2

The whole reason you shift up is to let the engine drop RPMs back down and climb again it only makes sense that it works the opposite way when slowing down. But a tip dont try doing that too much when your first learning stick that will burn through your clutch faster. Get better at driving and shifting smoothly while accelerating and only rev match into lower gears when necessary until you get better at communicating with your car and understand how it works better. ,cars,chbe6x8,4,t5_2qhl2

956738,0,t3_252avn,The Viper may have a large engine but the rest of it fits the sports car category much better. It is a two door two seatermore traditional  fairly lightweight rwdmore traditional and was purposebuilt as such a great sporting car. The Corvette is in the same category. A Charger is a muscle car especially these late years. The E AMG also fits. This is because muscle cars were often just hot trim levels of a midsized or larger familyfriendly sedan. The top muscle car trim would come from taking a better engine usually from something more sporting and putting it into the family sedan along with some other better parts to help the car deal with the extra power. The Charger uses the same Vs as the Challenger and for a short while the E AMG had a variant of the engine used in the SLS. Keep in mind that the lower trims arent really much to write home about and thats one of the key defining traits of a muscle car. Bonus time Mustangs amp Camaros are not muscle cars. They are referred to as pony cars. A pony car starts out being sporty and different engine choices can give them power like a muscle car but better performance due to a smaller amp lighter platform meant to be sporty. The difference is clear even at a lower level. Whats more sporty a V Mustang or a V Charger or E?You can sort of think of pony cars being one of the types that fit between muscle cars and sports cars. ,cars,chd1fou,1,t5_2qhl2

Its not about underhood space its not about fitting it in there its about redoing the whole fucking production line to accomodate another engine variant. It is infinitely more economical to reconfigure the existing engine than it is to throw in a radically different design.

1009552,0,t3_25mf0i,Yeah Subaru has lost almost all of its uniqueness and charm IMO.  Aside from the BRZ and the performance trim Imprezas WRXSTi they havent put out anything Ive liked since .  The new cars even drive terribly.  Ive driven a  Outback and a  Forester first of all they feel even more massive than they look.  But also all driver controls steering pedals shifter are just so numb and dead.  I was scared to go over mph on the highway in the Forester because there was no responsiveness from the steering whatsoever.Very much the same story with the Outback in fact aside from sitting a little lower it felt like the exact same car.  My  and my  were actually fun and engaging to drive.  Slow yes heavy yes but still responsive.  The  was awful in every way.Im bummed that they killed off the Legacy and Outback turbos and manual options for the NA ones on the  refresh they dropped the displacement and consequently about hp on the NA Impreza and Crosstrek put new engines in the NA Impreza an WRX but still have that EJ from the stone ages in the STi the supposed Flagship Impreza.  The FXT deserves a manual again too boring since  if youre going to make it autoonly you could at least do better than a EAT and a CVT.  New model refreshes look and feel bloated and ugly interior at least on the Legacy line took a step backwards with the  refresh.But really I wouldnt care about all that if theyd just make cars that are fun again.

Car is most likely going to be joyridden. Also if you are staying at a place for an extended time tipping more can get you special treatment.  Eg car being parked in vip areas or getting your car first before other people. As other have mentioned having a hidden camera in your car is a really good thing. Most valets dont steal from cars but it only takes one time to really mess you up. Last important thing if you are leaving your car somewhere take pictures of your car. Even if the valet does damage your car the owners of the company will deny it and unless you have proof they wont do anything about it.I dont know much about Canadian currency  but Id stick will bills.

1063708,0,t3_26a5a5,I run a fleet of over  vehicles.  Actually closer to  if you count the bigger trucks.  If these are all onroad miles theres not a huge difference in reliability between the Ford and Chevy.  Ill buy whichever is the better deal almost always the Ford.  I have a couple of the Ecoboost Fords and theyve done well one has over k already.  We usually keep them to around k miles depending on how theyre holding up.  Thats usually the sweet spot where they start having issues that make it more cost effective to sell them and get into a new vehicle.  Ive not done any cost analysis yet on the new Dodge diesels and likely will wait a couple years to see how the reliability goes.  I also want to see if the mpg actually works out to what is advertised.  Historically Ive bought zero Dodges for biz.  The good news is that its only a  option which actually has a lot of potential to work out financially.  I rarely buy a diesel  ton anymore because the  price bump is just too much and the mileage really isnt that impressive on the bigger trucks unless youre towing constantly.  ,cars,chp754i,2,t5_2qhl2

Because now not only are you turning the wheels yourself but are also forced to push the fluid around the hydraulic circuit as well just to get the rack to move.Even if you drained the fluid youd still have a system with the leverage and ratios that were intended for power assist.  Nonassist steering generally is designed with more turns lock to lock for an easier time turning the wheel think of it like a lower gear ratio on a bicycle easier to turn but not as fast  So a power system thats broken is really hard to turn like trying to ride a bike up a hill in top gear while surrounded in hydraulic fluid...,cars,chpgmv1,2,t5_2qhl2

This is about the same price as an entry level Z z etc which seems about right.  The v is rumoured to be around  plus options so around the k USD mark which is actually fairly cheap considering its up against things like the big engine Audis and BMWs which are  more.

You have  choices either use the discount  see what the boss says and give it another go or buy from the other company and enjoy the lifetime warranty. If you feel you are entitled to a free replacement then go ahead and post on the forums about it but I like many others below see this is more of an issue of you feeling entitled and not an issue with the manufacturer. ,cars,chxeyj7,3,t5_2qhl2

If nothing else it gives you a baseline. The dealer might or might not be able to beat the bankCU but at least you have a target to shoot for. As far as finding a car  email the local dealers and have their internet manager give you some quotes its much less stressful than going at it with the sales guy as all he wants to do is push units.

I wouldnt suggest going for a road trip with the car youre planning to track especially for your first time.  Keep it close to home just in case.Other than that look into racing schools like skip barber check out the SCCA etc.Maybe consider looking for an autocross event before going to a track.  Youll learn a lot about your car that way and be more prepared once you end up on a track as a result.  Cones are a lot more friendly than tire walls or worse.,cars,ci145uq,7,t5_2qhl2

Ive never had a turbo before so the whole moving forward in first pretty normally then at  or so RPM wam bam turbo power. As for DD its nice slightly louder than G for my normal commute but I love the great view ability. Lots of leg room in the back row and the Trunk is probably twice the size of the BRZ and Gs.The BRZ is pretty linear in power a lot like my old civic Si but with a tad bit more power... but compared to the WRX or G it isnt fast. at all. Quick and agile is an apt description. I love driving the damn thing though. Lots of engine  road noise. But its still great for everyday use. Can store quite a bit on the back seats and in the trunk.The G is pretty and it felt faster throughout the powerband compared to the WRX and BRZ but its also a hp V. The downsides for me small trunk stupid square cupholders no good way to fit a bicycle. The pros Very comfy DD seats are pretty awesome compared to the Subaru backseat was pretty usable miles better than BRZs back storage row the Nav was actually useable.

Nowhere have I condoned what the OP did Im merely talking about what caused the situation.gt Its safer to slow down with the other drivers than to overtake them or cause a much dangerous situation. Except there are cases where slowing down makes a situation more dangerous. Talk all you want about what the safest way to drive is but the bottom line is that people like to go fast. You can decide you dont need to go fast but other people will still want to and lets be realistic that will never change. That means if youre driving mph under the speed limit people are going to get frustrated and angry and look for ways to get around you doing things they wouldnt normally do. That is going to make them prone to do something stupid exactly like what the OP did.Im not disagreeing that what OP did was stupid although none of us know for sure without having been there Im simply saying that the slow driver is what created the situation that led to the accident in the first place.,cars,ci4trwq,2,t5_2qhl2

1215358,0,t3_280zy8,Youre not going to get much of a muscle feel for really any car which is front wheel drive. Just isnt what muscle is. You can do sporty though and there are plenty of choices to choose from when it comes to FWD sports cars. Most of which are going to be from Japanese and other Asian automakers hence the lack of muscle.The Acura Honda Integra is one of my favorite cars of all time. The DA    is in my opinion very good looking and decently fast car stock. The Integra engine B or B also supports a wide variety of mods that make them go just oh so fast.Honda Prelude can be had for less then  grand easy and youll get a much newer car then the Integra as well as an extra  bhp or so. The fifth gen    would be the one you want and they come with many excellent safety and gofast options from factory  wheel steering and VTEC.A Toyota Celica is a car Ive heard fairly good things about although they are not the best looking cars in the world if you ask me. There is a turbo model that goes for well under k.Mitsubishi GT is another good Japanese choice only problem it is getting harder and harder to find a unmolested GT for cheap. But if you put in the time and effort Im sure you could find one for under .Moving over to the Germans a Volkswagon Corrado is another fine choice if you ask me. Im not sure on realistic pricing for these cars but Ill be damned if they are more then  grand. Theyve got a fairly decent amount of pep and to me they are on par with the Integra DA for looks. Only problem is German car means German parts means relatively expensive if something major goes wrong.If you want to stay American the Chevy Cobalt SS can be found for around  grand if you look hard enough and with  horsepower they can get off the line righteously quick. But be wary Chev is doing a huge recall on the Cobalt due to faulty starters and other things.Those are all my favourite FWD sports cars I can remember off the top of my head all are good choices in my opinion Except maybe the Cobalt because of the recall but damn those things haul. I currently own a  Integra GS not even the GSR and I love that thing more then pretty much anything its just a car with so much character. Its never let me down and shifts like a dream.

More than likely you will have engine problems later and at that time you will learn more about getting things to run properly. Also I cannot emphasize finding a rust free car enough. When you go to look at a car check all over for rust. Body work is a pain.  hours of body work will show almost nothing while in  hours you can have an engine pulled and taken apart.The cost will be completely up to you. It probably wont be very expensive to get the car driving but it can become expensive once you start doing paint jobs engine rebuilds and all new interior. Just remember projects are never finished. If you plan on keeping it dont rush yourself. It is about learning and the experience.One more thing. Make friends who are into classics. Go to car shows. Talk to people.

Im not saying this to knock your abilities in any way but there isnt a single person out there who couldnt use more practice.

You just cant make a gas car with such a low center of gravity and two enormous trunks and a flat floor and RWD and low maintenance etc.. Has to be electric. Least favorite Chrysler but since thats too obvious Toyota. At least modern Toyota. I have a project AW MR and I must admit its a fun little car. But all they make now is automotive appliances.

When people dynod them they would actually get whp ratings that were higher than what Dodge claimed it made at the crank. Plus they just loved mods whp SRTs are almost as common as stock ones these days.Not to mention you could buy one for like K when they were new. Some stock ones even broke into the high  second  mile range granted most people couldnt break .I know it took a bit of a jab at some other cars at the first of my comment and I know that punch for punch something like an Evo is the better performance car but these days you can buy a solid SRT for like  grand dump a few thousand more into it and you have an absolute monster... but dont worry its only a Neon.,cars,cijm5me,1,t5_2qhl2

1372323,0,t1_cioawpl,That would be possible if you didnt have it kind of mixed up on how theyre doing the MX. The deal with it is that Mazda is developing the chassis then they let Alfa Romeo use that. Mazda does  of the development for the MX and Alfa gets the chassis to slap their own engine and drive train in and then drapes their own sheet metal over top of it. I honestly havent read anything about what Mazda gets out of the deal aside from the implied lower cost of production costs due to volume. Ill have to do some more reading but from everything I know so far Mazda is using zero tech from Italy to build the MX.Edit looked up about a dozen or so articles. Two things one Mazda needed the cash flow to help develop the car since theyre strapped for yen thats their part of the deal. Two the thing might not be an Alfa any more because Sergio Macchione is xenophobic towards where cars are built so it may wind up being a Fiat Abarth model instead of an Alfa Romeo which means the Alfa Spider has to be rebuilt from the ground up and may or may not wind up on a platform sharing deal with Chrysler RWDAWD platform cars including the damn Charger.,cars,ciob4f0,2,t5_2qhl2

The original demographic of Viper owners either think its gone too softmodern Stability control? Cup holders? Digital gauges? Pah! Get off my lawn or not fast enough because  years ago hp was amazing and today hp is nothing to write home about Needs at least rwhp but I want to pay k for it like the good old days. Others overlook it because its still too hardcore and old school. Numbers junkies want it to have AWD and better hpL and hybrid gear and DCT and forced induction so it could do  in less than  seconds and  in the mid s stock like their GTR ignoring that the truck engined RWD manual low tech trickier to drive Viper still gets around a track quicker than the supercar slaying Godzilla.

Well its a supercharged V sooo... yeah you can kiss those thoughts of passing me goodbye.Yeah probably I guess...Weird thing to say to someone but whatever.We go off and through T and over the hill he pulls from me. Then on T Im right behind him. He gains a tiny bit until T comes and Im on him again. Same with T. Before T he pulls. And I catch up in the turn. Pulls a lot up the hill to T but I can take T with barely a lift. T to the exit of the corkscrew Im on his bumper the whole time. He gets away very slightly all before the final turn and it all happens again. Me on his bumper for about  laps.Were not allowed to pass unless we get a point by because its a beginners group.

1512539,0,t1_cj5txa7,The physics in play with rally are a bit different than tarmac drifting physics.Grip on gravel is a very linear coefficient without the plateau that happens with tarmac due to tire outgassing and high frequency vibrations. More newtons in a direction  more thrust in that direction.Think of it like playing old school asteroids with the space ship that slides around.With tarmac you are applying tractive forces tangential to the turn radius.With gravel if you turn in further with a steep slip angle and bury the throttle you are applying a force towards the center of the turn radius. This is counter balanced with your momentum carrying you tangental to the turn radius. Burying the throttle creates more wheel spin but its also increasing your force towards the inside of the corner. This allows you to stay on the road where if you drove straight through the corner you would fly off because you are generating insufficient traction.This is why higher powered rally cars can actually turn tighter. They are able to apply more force towards the center of a corner and stay on the road with a much steeper slip angle.,cars,cj5vfym,52,t5_2qhl2

1531211,0,t3_2brlpc,Taylor of Dallas Performances response if anybody is interested page  post  on the lambo talk threadgtFirst and foremost I need to apologize to Billy as we havent done right by you nor did you end up a satisfied customer. Before any blog was created before this became a public issue I have offered to take care of this for you totally free of charge especially since you were our second TTG customer. gtgtCurrently we have completed over  Twin Turbo Gallardo builds with satisfied customers and although I have no control over stock parts breaking it has never been my intention for you to pull your car have a pile of parts and a Gallardo roller in your possession nor do I understand what that affords you at this point. Again I extend to you the offer to provide you a completed Twin Turbo Gallardo assuming I can receive all the parts that you took back with you. Any shop runs the risk of having a problem during a vehicle build but I truly believe in making you happy and I am confident I can do so. gtgtYou have paid for a Stage  build at a heavily discounted price which you agreed and understood would come with no warranty and several very nice driveline upgrades. Although you were adamant about running the car at much higher power levels as much as  whp against my advice for longevity I have done so for you which I now regret because we did not make the supporting modifications mandatory. What I am offering is to provide your vehicle with a running Stage  system with our  year mile warranty turned down to  whp. I will also provide transportation for your vehicle and parts back to the shop and free delivery back to you once your vehicle is completed. I cant think of any other way to help you enjoy your car unless a competitor has lured you away with a free build in exchange for an attempt to discredit us.gtgtTo the others that are viewing this thread what has been represented in the blog is not  accurate but explaining myself or trying to point out what is inaccurate will not make Billy a happy customer or help the situation. I have tried to reach out to Billy multiple times since he decided to retrieve his vehicle and today is the first time he has responded. It is unfortunate to be tried by the internet jury especially when only one side is posted. I have invested a lot of time and my personal finances in building Dallas Performance what it is today. I dont take any of the accusations lightly and will continue to attempt to rectify this with Billy. gtgtI would like to point out that with no reference to what work is done what is represented by the photos can be grossly misjudged. Billys car had issues before it was brought to us and has been documented at the Lamborghini dealer not to mention a large aftermarket stereo installed prior to us receiving it. We pride ourselves in providing high quality work and what is pictured in the blog is not indicative of the work Dallas Performance provides to its customers. I am happy to walk anyone through our shop and go over any of the many builds in our shop all in various stages. I am confident you will not find examples of this kind of work in any of our builds.,cars,cj87ps0,22,t5_2qhl2

If you go much faster and are involved in a crash you most likely get partially blamed. Most parts of the Autobahn are restricted and most of the time it isnt even possible to sustain  mph.Youll always have drivers in front of you that cant really tell if youre going  or  mph.

1730108,0,t1_cjx83ep,You are completely right and I dont know why someone would be downvoting you. I recently drove a few small cars and here is a little more information about eachFiesta Decent interior but tiny. The overall outer dimensions arent that much different than the Fit but the interior just wasnt designed for space. Im  and I rarely have trouble fitting in the back of a car but my legs hit the front seat and my head hit the ceiling in the Fiesta. The only way I would consider one is if I was only driving and possibly riding with one passenger. I drove the .L Ecoboost and it was actually a pretty decent engine. I cant really speak to any of the other engines though.Sonic Its Ok would be the best way to describe it. Im not a fan of the overall interior design it seems like they purposely tried to make it quirky to appeal to the younger crowd. The materials were definitely cheap. I test drove an LT and a base model at separate times and the LT with the turbo was a little more fun but it still wasnt very fast. The lowest end base model had manual windows which I couldnt really get past.Fit Great interior space. The interior seems very roomy for the size of the car. Folding down the seats gives you twice the cargo space the Fiesta has. The interior is simple but it doesnt really give off a cheap vibe. The new engine has direct injection and gets great mileage. After checking out the fit I wouldnt even consider buying a Sonic or the Fiesta.,cars,cjx8tp8,1,t5_2qhl2

1748192,0,t1_cjzb5n7,I think we often underestimate the durability of a clutch.  I learned on my GS  speed sedan and those clutches are pretty notorious for burning out but Im here a couple years later and still no problems.  Additionally Ive taught a couple people how to drive stick on it.  As far as the wear goes I think there are a variety of factors that will play into the durability such as previous use preexisting conditions etc. but I wouldnt be overly concerned.  Its going to take a while to get there.  If you really want to reduce clutch wear I would recommend you take her out intermediately and make a determination on what areas she could improve on.  Generally a person will get the muscle memory and be able to release immediately to the bite point which will help with the process of hills speedbumps etc. That will significantly reduce wear.  Really its just a monitoring process just like anything else on the car.  All in all sounds like she did a good job.  ,cars,cjzip9n,1,t5_2qhl2

Thats up there with the Gullwing and whatnot because they were made to order very specific and after Horacio Pagani drove one he asked Benz if he could stick it in his Zondas as you already know.Theyre fucking crazy fast though.  There have been faster cars made notably the SL AMG V biturbo which pushed out roughly  hp and like lbs torque which I did get to drive in  when they were at their prime imo and it sounded just as angry as youd imagine.  The car would not gain traction even if you asked it nicely on a hot summer day running super slicks.  The traction control was pointless itd just keep the wheels from spinning harder not stop them from spinning and it would just blink at you.  And IF you finally made traction with the pedal to the floor you would fly so fast through the gears that  mph came before I was ready.  It was probably the craziest GT car Ive ever driven.

1926207,0,t1_ckkpq2i,To add a little detail to other peoples comments.... The car and the remote both have a random number generator RNG in them. The way RNGs work in computing is by providing a seed number so if two identical RNGs are seeded with the same number they will continue to produce the same series of numbers as each other. When the car and the remote are synced together they are set to use the same seed figure which will be different from every other car out there The seed is usually chosen based on the time down the microsecond. When you press the remote the remote will generate the next number in the random sequence and send it out. If the car receives it it checks what it believes the next random number should be and if its right unlocks the car. Now one quirk of the whole system is that the car has to store a list of the next few random numbers. Otherwise if you locked your car and walked away then accidentally pressed the button a few times the remote would be ahead of the car as far as the random sequence goes. Most cars will normally allow the next  codes to be accepted.The upshot of the above is that on a disturbingly large number of cars if you take the remote go out of range of the car and press the button  or so times it will now be out of sync with the car.

One of my main reasons for getting my Maxima was the incredibly nice interior. Plus it has tons of rear legroom. The wheelbase on the G was cut a lot and all of that reduction is in the rear legroom.  hp vs  hp but still an open diff and probably extra torque steer.Oh and I think the G has lifeless electric steering  My Maxima still has nice hydraulic steering.

1980682,0,t1_ckrh4jm,Ooh this makes me think of something similar that happened to me two weeks ago. My cat had just had a litter of kittens that I REALLY need to get rid of and after asking several people do you want a kitten to no avail I decided to ask the girl I had a crush on if she was interested.She said yes. And suggested that I simply take her home with me after school. So thats what I did after six more periods of oh fucks screaming in my head as well as prayers that my Pontiac Montana wouldnt have any issues she and I walked out to the parking lot and started cruising home. Compared to the suburban hell that my high school is built in I live out in the boondocks where lifted coalrollers are the norm not minivans. Of course right as we cross over from pavement to gravel I could feel it coming.The tachometer starting to droop. no no pleeeease not nowEngine temperature rising. NO. NO. NO!!Power steering cut off. Brakes suddenly getting heavy. FUCK!!The engine died right in the middle of the road. I dont know if my fumbling with the ignition shifter and pedals was too much or not enough but one quick glance in her direction was enough. She was pissed making sure to tell me that my attempts to get into her pants by way of breaking down in the middle of nowhere would not be honored or something like that. I didnt quite catch that I was trying to get the van started again.Naturally the van came back to life right after she got out and walked away. She never did get to see those kittens.,cars,ckrvfwc,2,t5_2qhl2

2012681,0,t3_2hqjs6,It makes no difference at all. You should ONLY use high octanepremium if your owners manual recommends it. No matter what anyone tells you premium does not give you a single extra horsepower if your car isnt designed for it and it doesnt have any extra cleaners its not better quality or better for your engine. All grades of gasoline of the same brand have the same detergent formula in them. The octane number just represents resistance to preignition that is the gas is a little harder to get to explode. Higher performance cars need this type of gasoline to make the most power due to more advanced timing higher compression etc. A Honda Civic will not run any differently on premium.  people may come in here after me and swear their Honda Civics are faster and get more MPG on premium but it is pretty much scientifically impossible.  Just Google octane and read up on it and youll see everything Ive said is true.  If you want your car to last as long as possible let it warm up for  seconds before driving off gently use full synthetic oil and do all of your scheduled maintance on time. Dont waste your money on premium gasoline.,cars,ckvq3wu,2,t5_2qhl2

Personally I ended up getting into the Avenger because of some shady dealing with a certain dealership and desperation of needing a new car that they put us into after they took my trade in and gave us a car only to tell us  weeks later that we arent actually approved for that car and theyll just help us get into another one.

Believe me if one OEM is making money at something everyone else is seeing if they can take a piece too. VW sells a lot of diesels but their other sales have been lackluster so its not exactly a mainstream feature. Turbo engines are automatically more expensive. You can pick up a SBC for k. A ford ecoboost .L will run you about k. Diesels work at even higher pressures have high pressure fuel lines and pumps higher tolerances are required it requires DEF and supporting equipment etc. Im not sure what information is publicly available but diesel engines are significantly more expensive than an NA gas. Add that with low demand in this country and you can understand why its not that widespread. ,cars,ckynqf4,1,t5_2qhl2

2073653,0,t3_2ilvq8,Theres no such thing as a stall converter vs a standard one. First of all the torque converter does not lock  until the lockup is electrically applied and this is controlled by your TCMPCM. What youre referring to is stall and thats when the converter begins transferring power to the transmission hydraulically. The difference between an aftermarket one vs stock in general is the stall ratio. A stock one will generally have a lower stall ratio IE .. This means the converter multiplies your torque by . upon stalling but this will happen at lower RPMs. A high stall  torque converter might have a . stall ratio which will give you torque times . but it will happen at a higher engine speed. The point at which the stall happens is based on a few factors like torque output converter size and converter design. Your best bet is to look at what other people are doing on the appropriate forums there are a lot of factors involved like you said. ,cars,cl3enje,2,t5_2qhl2

2092791,0,t1_cl5irlf,The title is a bit misleading. They just said that they were making progress toward their goal of reducing by . That said BMW has been investing heavily in carbon fiber production improvement. If the engineers come up with some clever solutions to existing problems that work on a large scale I can see prices dropping  eventually.There are a few reasons why I believe this could happen  There is a huge financial incentive to create cheaper CF Cars have been steadily getting heavier due to increased safety regulations and increased demand for equipment from consumers. This is at odds with the increased demand for fuel efficiency. Car companies have been able to make engine efficiency outpace weight gain as a factor in fuel consumption so far. The past few years theyve managed to pull out the stops and implement some amazing solutions hybrids downsizing and turbo Atkins cycle. However theyve also seen increased fuel economy regulations CAFE is the example Im thinking of. After this era of fuel economy improvements plateaus I imagine increased emphasis on weight savings will be a factor. Some companies are going to see this untapped market and scramble to come up with the best ideas for CF production. Economy of scale will make CF production much cheaper when it is implemented in cars The current processes for CF production will definitely not be the same as those we see when CF is produced in the amounts demanded by the auto industry. Look at the difference between how a low level Aston Martin is produced compared to a Mercedes SClass of the same caliber. They may be comparably priced and have comparable levels of luxury. However the AM is produced on a much smaller scale and it makes sense for them to use far fewer machines and automation techniques. The SClass is a much higher volume car and the production techniques are completely different as a result. Imagine if CF went higher volume and became as big of an industry as there is for Aluminum. Suppliers of raw materials and machines competition between CF producers and wider knowledge of how to implement CF in a mass produced car would all drive the price down significantly. CF tech has been trickling down for decades The  McLaren MP F car was the first F car to have a CF structure. In  the Ferrari F had much of the bodywork made of CF. In  the McLaren F became the first road car to have a CF structure. In  the Lamborghini Murcielago had some of the bodywork made of CF and selling for significantly less than the F. In  The M coupe has a CF roof panel. In  the Corvette Zr has many body panels made of CF and selling for around k. In  the Aventador comes out as the Murcielago successor with a CF structure rather than just bodywork. I believe this trend will continue to eventually include much more basic cars.,cars,cl5u8vz,3,t5_2qhl2

2106703,0,t3_2j1mnz,Tow truck driver here. If the car is not able to have the wheel turned having it stuck in gear makes the job easier to yank it around and make the car change directions. Thats what the snatch block is for. However nearly all German cars and recently a lot of Japanese and American cars too dont have any sold attachment points underneath the chassis. A screw in tow hook is required. If one doesnt have this hook towing it away with a winch can present a lot of problems. Especially if its stuck in parkgearparking brake. You can always grab it by the lower control arms. But that only works if the vehicle is in neutral. Otherwise youre gonna bend the hell out of them. If I see an illegally parked BMW or newer German car chances are I am not touching it. I dont carry the tow hooks for them with me. In those cases this is what a wrecker and dollies are for. All those saying you cant tow a car that is stuck in park with all the wheels locked. You are dreaming. You can always be towed. Ive pulled  dually quad cab pickups from a perpendicular spot using my flat bed. It has absolutely no trouble grabbing any car. In fact if I have no way of unlocking the steering its better off all the wheels are locked. Now it will change direction by using my snatch block. It wont do that in neutral. In neutral it will just pull in a straight line. With a snatch block I can pull a car out of a spot that is perpendicular to my truck no problem. This is why standards can be a challenge to get out of a perpendicular spot. The wheels will keep turning even if they are in gear and the vehicle will just pull straight and not want to make the  degree turn to get onto the bed. This is what wheel chocks are for. Use two placed diagonally from each other to block the wheels in the direction you want the vehicle to turn. Rocking back and forth though? About all I can think of is the guy was trying to walk the bed under the car. That doesnt work without having a cable attached to hold the vehicle and while its in neutral. Ive scooped some failed ball joints like this sometimes it makes things easier. But that wont work if its stuck in park unless your bed is made of ice. Or maybe he was dropping it off and you missed it? You get a vehicle stuck in park or gear off of your bed by rocking it back and forth. Most will slide off eventually. For the tough ones I carry a bottle of soap with me. That will slide anything right off. ,cars,cl7lvu2,27,t5_2qhl2

2124001,0,t3_2j6nth,Get some  wheels if your cars brakes will clear them I imagine not a problem and get the right width for the tire you want.  I dont know how much power youre putting down you probably want something  wide.Diameter is determined by how much room you have and how much power youre making.  I bet youll want in the neighborhood of a  slick.  You may need to lift the rear slightly to clear  slicks.  A taller tire means a longer footprint which means more traction.A lot of people will tell you that you will break something on slicks well thats not entirely true.  Slicks are EXTREMELY soft.  They wad up and act as a giant cusion taking the shock load out of your launch.  If you break something with slicks it is because you make too much power and it was going to break anyway.  Wheelhop from stiff street tires is much more destructive than launching on slicks.I dont quite understand your comment about being street legal too.  No slick is street legal.  They do make DOT drag radials with a little bit of tread but these will perform nowhere near as well as a real drag slick because they have stiff sidewalls so your car will actually go around corners.,cars,cl9t27f,1,t5_2qhl2

2143645,0,t3_2jjib2,The first lap should be a warmup lap  warm up the tires brakes and get familiar with the track. Do not try to go very fast during this lap.Be smoooooth. Weight transfer is both the friend and enemy in street and track driving. You can be very fast and still very smooth. Roll on the gas. Squeeze the brake pedal. Imagine the steering wheel coated in ice. Jerking the wheel will cause it to slip out of your hands. Quick but smooth motions will prevent slip.Keep your eyes up and looking where you want to go. People often fixate on stuff close to them or what they want to avoid. You usually end up going where you look  so you can see how that can be a problem. These cars can go really fast. They can also brake really well. Youll be carrying more speed than youre probably used to. Dont be afraid to lean really hard on the brakes BEFORE you start to turn in. All slowing should be done before turning the wheel. If the car understeers chances are you went in too hot. Remember to breath and release your death grip on the steering wheel. Everyone tenses up. You need to remind yourself to relax a little. Many people do their best lap when they arent trying all that hard. Have fun! Take lots of pics and video!,cars,clcb088,2,t5_2qhl2

2229603,0,t3_2kn1cp,Hey Sal.Electrical Engineer here working for one of the big three. Im going to be very real with you here.With a biology major it will be incredibly difficult if not impossible to get a job directly in the automotive industry. If you switch to bioengineering you may just have a shot. Still like someone mentioned before the automotive industry looks more for Mechanical Electrical Industrial and sometimes Chemical Engineers. I find BioEs focus more on the medical field pays more too.As a result my question to you is what do you want to do in the automotive industry? If I get a better idea what you want to work on I can better guide you on the appropriate action you should take to get that job.However one massive warning to you. Just because you like driving working on modding or just enjoy cars in general that doesnt necessarily mean you will enjoy this field. Too many people confuse tunermechanic with engineering and the positions couldnt be anymore different. ,cars,cln8hq9,2,t5_2qhl2

To me this is missing out on the most important part of driving a footclutch car.....control over the clutch!  Yer left foot or left hand if were talking motorcycles controls this weird power play between the engines power and the driven wheels.  Launching a car at a stoplight vs. backing up in a crowded parking lot is a totally different experience.  Popping a  revmatched downshift as youre about to enter a twisty section of backroads is a skill that you have to try to achieve properly.  You miss out on that constant practice and fun with a computer controlled clutch.  For me if youre looking for fun its a no brainer  go with a human controlled clutch.  If youre looking for lap times or using lap times as justification on the internet for buying an automatic car because you want people on the internet to think youre a racecar driver or something go with with computer controlled clutch.,cars,clv6fov,11,t5_2qhl2

2314818,0,t3_2lrpz1,I have a  . There are a few common issues with these engines. First is they have a sludging problem so make sure that the owner has the PCV update  installed which should take care of the problem. You also may want to drop the oil pan to clean out any sludge or things blocking the oil pickup screen if there is any.A second common problem is that they leak oil out of the Oil pressure switch because of a bad o ring. This is a pain to change out because it is on the back side of the block behind the starter and you cant get a normal wrench or socket in there so you have to use a cut off mm box end wrench.A third problem that seems to be common is the DI cassette goes bad which is an easy fix but the part costs like .Parts are easy to come by on the internet for whatever you will need but there arent lots of shops work on Saabs.From what Ive heard the V  has tons of problems so steer clear of those. ,cars,clxtrn5,3,t5_2qhl2

2347941,0,t3_2m8bb0,the short answer is yes. wheel drive trucks typically use locking differentials the benefit here is all  wheels are always spinning the same speed so on loose surface this is best the problem with this in the snow is that you are constantly shifting surface from loose snow to hard pavement if you have  wheel drive on and this happens one wheel gets grip and  others have poor traction it will case a violent spin.ALL wheel drive insinuates that you have independent differentials in the front rear and center which can bias power from each wheel independently this is why Subarus symmetrical all wheel drive system is so well praised because the drive shafts are equal in length and the ingenious differential setup the car can bias its power to any of the  wheels in real time the same goes for Audis quattro system which isnt symmetrical but has a trick center differential which does the same kind of job. ,cars,cm1x0ml,1,t5_2qhl2

With the Viper you have one of the top  fastest production cars in the world.  Its the absolute fastest under .  Its unique and while just a two seater the new Vipers have come a long long way.With the Hellcat you have a body style that looks the same as hundreds of other cars on the road in a body that will be out of style in a couple of years.  HP that is only available under extreme and ideal conditions.  I just dont see the resell value maintaining decent levels and paying k above MSRP is just insane.

If some assclown hit you you should be asking them to pay for the repair his insurance would likely pay your deductible. He already admitted fault. I hope you got his insurance information and contact details.Guys word for the wise if you are in any accident NEVER admit you are at fault. Also take photos take down license plate numbers get contact and insurance information if possible.

2517208,0,t1_cmn45zr,Well one of the first things once youre comfortable in the car is to run a skid padAFTER you check out the tires and suspension to make sure it isnt ready to fail and turn you on your lid basically just drive in a tight circle and keep trying to increase speed without increasing circle diameter. Either the car will push the front end out or snap the tail loose and spin. All cars are different so I personally do this with every car I own. Do it a few times and it will help you learn how to RECOVER from loss of control. Also youll wanna run some panic stop tests. Drive at a set speedsay  of mph and at a reference point stand on the brake pedal. Road test data for stopping distance is great and all but actually having stooped your OWN car as fast as possible is a lot more useful. After that its up to you. You want to know the cars limits and how to recover if you exceed them. I should mention Ive been driving  years and have never been in a collision just as an aside.

2522417,0,t1_cmnlbgi,What I do for a living Im a software engineer. I also used to own part of a company which we later sold. Made some money. You were wondering about boostrapping thats what we did no VC money or trust funds involved. As far as political support was not a Romney supporter. The current incarnation of the Republican party isnt realitybased enough for me. Theyve turned tax cutting into a holy doctrine that cannot be challenged ignoring the fact that the Laffer Curve has never been demonstrated to be significant at realworld levels of taxation. They ignore the science on climate change and theyre dishonest about immigration policy. They also claim to be fiscally responsible but the last time they controlled both the Presidency and Congress they increased spending and deficits.All that said I actually believe that Romney would have made a decent President. He had been a Republican governor of a liberal state so he had experience compromising to get stuff done. He had been a very high level businessman so he understood finance in a deep way. When he was put in charge of the Olympics it ran a surplus. His biggest achievement which he was forced to run away from in the election was the health care system that Obamacare is based on.

2610416,0,t1_cmagaqe,Thanks for all of advice.... Im hoping you can help me out again with some of your insider advice.Here are pictures of the damage My car has been in the shop for almost almost a month and so far absolutely no progress has been made on its repair. The estimate has crept up to  and one of the repair shop employees has said in not so many words that GEICO is notorious for lowballing them.When I spoke with damage specialist earlier this week he estimated the time frame for repair at  additional weeks because the parts they need are on back order.  Then today I spoke with the claims adjuster at GEICO who now says there is no longer an ETA on the repair... it could conceivably be longer than  weeks. Additionally after the body work is done the car will need to go back to the dealer to replace the airbags... and there is no estimate on how long that will take.  Furthermore my rental allowance from GEICO expires in  week at which point I would have to pay for a rental car. The adjuster said that they are prohibited by law to extend the rental period because I would be getting something that was not part of the contract and therefore profiting from the insurance. So now I am being told that I will have to rent a car for an indefinite period of time because there are no parts available. Its not like I have an exotic foreign car. The Chrysler  is assembled literally miles from where I live and there are no replacement parts allocated for repairs?Is there anything I can do at this point? I feel like Im getting the run around. I am thinking at this point they are putting my car on the back burner because GEICO isnt paying out what they want.I am making car payments on a car that apparently cant be fixed in a timely manner Im continuing to make insurance payments and apparently will have to rent a car for an indefinite period of time.

2662991,0,t1_cn65qw2,gt I think the transition was handled poorly and that forced him to leave. Because they didnt expect such a massive push back against the subscription model they ended up instituting an abrupt change which absolutely axed their viewing numbers which in turn made it difficult for Chris to get the cars he wanted as companies didnt view him as relevant.All I have to go on is what Matt said on the now pulled episode which was also discussed here Obviously thats one side of the story but the gist of it is that Chris knew exactly what to expect about the viewership numbers and pushed for it anyways.  He apparently had some level of ownership with voting rights within the company so his opinion carried more weight than other hosts like Farah and Musto who are just employees.The numbers Chris knew to expect were apparently beaten but he still went this way.  He also penned that post arguing publicly for this model using his most expensive video apparently also Drives most expensive video as the justification as if that was normal for what it costs them to do these things.  This didnt help anything since it really made it look like Drive was wasting money making videos that cost way too much when that one was more of an exception than the rule.If we take even half of what Matt said as true and combine it with what Chris has posted publicly I cant feel bad for him.  He knew the numbers would tank and pushed for it anyways so he cant say I cant work with this after the fact and get any sympathy from me.Hes still a great auto journalist and I still love watching his videos but itll take a lot for me to not feel negatively about him as a person with how things went down.If Chris or anyone from Drive wants to set the record straight Id love to hear it but Im sure theres some lawyers out there that would shut that down in seconds.,cars,cn66hhi,-1,t5_2qhl2

2683167,0,t3_2qrdce,So you are slated to pay  in payments plus another  up front? Yeah thats a lot. The dealer hid their profit in the markup rather than charge you interest. Thats pretty sucky because you cant pay it off early if possible to avoid paying that profit margin. That means even if you go to trade it or sell it you still owe the entire amount. On the other hand you have no credit history so thats a considerable risk on an item that can be transported anywhere. Depending on equipment edmunds says its worth .The good thing is that its a relatively recent model so some age related items wont have had a chance to show up yet. Given the miles on the car Id say there is maybe  chance it will go past K miles. So they likely factor in that you may default either because you cant pay for repairs or you see no point in paying for a car that doesnt work. Get the car carefully inspected by a mechanic you trust and try to identify weak spots that may need addressed. Youre going to have it a while. I assume the car has a clean title?Sadly making these payments on time very likely will do nothing for your credit rating because these dealers dont report to any of the credit agencies.,cars,cn8t6f1,22,t5_2qhl2

2696088,0,t3_2qvs6r,Ive posted this before but this is why I buy used I feel like this puts me more in control of the situation and allows me to get the bast bang for my buck with the least longterm loss.  this doesnt matter newused just a good tip Get your loan in advance. I was preapproved up to k from my credit union. Walking in and knowing you can negotiate and just tell them that youre buying it outright gives you a lot of leverage. Research the crap out of the cars you want. I was looking for new demo  Taurus SHO and while researching I found a  year old car owned by a Ford executive as a fleet car that had k miles. The dealer had it for  months and replaced the rear shocks. all learned via carfax. I went in and argued that as this was a rental that was beat up by its previous owner and even needed repairs upon being bought by the dealer I shouldnt have to pay that much for a car that will break on me. Got the price down k off of the k cheaper price vs new. Know what youre buying. I talked a guy at a dealership into getting me a Mannheim Report for auctions for that car yearmakemodelcolorsimilar options for the last  monthsIts amazing how much a pizza can get you. With this I knew what similar cars in that color with that mileageoptions package sold at dealer auction for during the period in which the car was sold to the dealer. In short I told them what they paid for it and how much profit I was going to give them. Find a Certified PreOwned car then GET THE CPO REMOVED. When they buy a car then list it as CPO they have to pay to get it certified and get the extended warranty. They wont spend the money until youve bought the car. No need to certify it if youre selling it a few months later at auction you know? Tell them to remove the Certification thats not even really on the car and the kish price hike and then negotiate on an extended warranty instead. Bonus to this tip? Theyve already repaired the car to make it Certified Ready and it has to pass inspections to become certified. Youre getting a car thats guaranteed to have been inspectedrepaired AND a cheaper warranty with identicalbetter coverage. Unless youre getting a great deal I think that buying new is probably the worst thing you can do. Every car I wanted while new was either a demo car loaner or something like thatalso consider cars that have been on the lot for over . months. They want to dump those faster. Buying new gives you a huge depreciation hit. Buy  years old with less than k miles. Youre likely to have a lease car or something similarly gently used that already lost its initial depreciation. ,cars,cnahxdx,1,t5_2qhl2

2704383,0,t1_cnbb4b4,was on mobile... meant total cost per month of the total purchase and operating expense. A brand new Hyundai does not cost zero dollars to operate. The warranty usually only covers things that break not consumables that every vehicle requires like oil changes gas tires batteries insurance etc.. Like utom above pointed out if you do the math a brand new economical vehicle like a Hyundai will cost more per month to purchase and operate than  year old german luxury vehicle that has been well maintained.here is why Germans build well engineered machines that do require relatively highmaintenance but they use very high quality materials and superior standards than Japanese and Korean vehicles. These vehicles when well maintained last a very long time and deliver a good ride quality. Because of the highmaintenance factor they tend to get overlooked or even looked down upon by Americans who have been conditioned to think cars should be very low maintenance. Therefore used German luxury cars typically sell for a much lower price.Germans take pride and value in higher maintenance vehicles and drive single models much longer periods. Where as americans value convenience and low maintenance vehicles produced by American Japanese and Korean manufacturers.So not all bmw merc or audi drivers are in it for the badge or the vanity. Some in the US like myself do value the nicer ride quality materials and dont mind doing the higher maintenance required to keep an older vehicle running in great shape. I see a lot more  good condition german cars on road than  year old Hyundais. Toyotas typically rust out in that period of time acuras and hondas have great engines but the interiors disintegrate after a period of time. Look at the sheet metal and plastic on  year old hyundai its looks like garbage wavy easily dented trim falls off road noise up the wazzoo. Many GM cars are just fleet vehicles with  year lifespans built into them. Its not that they are bad vehicles they are just built with different standards. And that standard over the course of time means you will be buying more of them and costing more than investing in higher quality luxury brand.,cars,cnbh7zp,1,t5_2qhl2

It was green and lean and rode on all steelies. One time it was raining and any owner of a Geo Metro knows that any sort of ailment on the road means almost certain death. Ive seen pebbles come at me and seriously fear for my life. Rain? Rain is crazy. Rain is fucking INSANE in a Geo Metro. Rain is like lava if you touch it you die. I was sliding about because the Geo felt like it and I was doing all I could to stay going the right direction. All of a sudden the car went totally sideways and kept perpendicular with the road for  or so feet till I was almost stopped. At about  miles and hour the car slid into a median sideways and rolled over onto the roof. I clambered out the passenger side cuz I welded my fucking door shut and flipped the bitch over and went home. I had to weld three of the doors closed because they kept falling off one of which being the drivers side door. It was not cool. My cousin worked at Ken Garff VolkswagenAudiPorsche as a customer service rep. One day on the way home from a hard day of high school and teenage hormonal drama I get a phone call from said cousin. He asked if I wanted to drive an R. YES YES YES YES YES YES YES I say. He says that hes on the way to my house right now so I better get there quick. He was coming from about  miles away all freeway. I was about  miles from my house when he called. I drove very fast for the Geo at least to get home taking corners at a spinetingling  miles an hour. As I round the final bend to my house I see a matte orange with black accent  R...with a supercharged V. The owner of said car was filthy rich and a close friend of my cousins. He lent my cousin the R for the weekend and told him to drive it like he stole it.My cousin ran down the car for me...nearly  HP to the wheels a supercharger that costs half as much as my house more engine work than I care to remember and of course the characteristic matte orange wrap. Oh it also had a giant GT wing on it which was dope as shit. My cousin tossed me the keys and told me that I can drive for as long as I want and do whatever I want but if I scrape I had to give over the wheel immediately. Deal. On the freeway on ramp I pulled in third gear thinking I was doing about . I looked down the speedo read . Well cant be a pussy in front of my older cuz so I kept my foot down.  by the top of the ramp lifted at . Ill always remember that.  MPH. . . . For those of you fortunate enough to not have gone that fast its terrifying. Solid objects trace at the edges of your vision.  MPH is a hallucinogen. It changes the way the world works for the few seconds you have the balls to keep going that fast.Now  wheel horsepower in one of the most brilliantly engineered allwheel drive vehicles ever made? What does that feel like? Like getting hit in the chest. Ever been in a car crash? Suddenly going from  to  in under a second? Imagine the reverse of that.  in under a second  in under . The acceleration snaps your head into the seat rest and pushes your body into the seat lifting your feet off the pedals. It takes all you have to keep your foot down. Also it likes to go sideways.

Thats my bias.It is lighter and smaller than the  series which just keeps getting bigger like that girl you had a crush on in high school then saw at starbucks  years later. The i has the same engine as the s its a good solid engine. The i is the gem. Be careful of the fuel pumps if memory serves me BMW offered extended warranty on that or some effort to give everyone a break.The original s had the...afficionados help me. N vs N? Im not great on nomenclature but they went from twin turbo to single turbo. Im not sure why. I wondered if it was to differentiate the Ms from the regulars.Anyway the is can be had in good condition for around k I think. The s you can get a good condition lower mileage one near your budget or a little higher. Look around see if its your kind of car drive both if you can see which you prefer if either. Thats the offering from BMW I like most besides the E M which is an enigma.I see people on Mustang forums who profess to drive  miles a year so I expected to see low mileage E Ms. The majority of low mileage examples I see have forced induction and pages of mods which in my experience means a combination of not streetable anymorebrokenin need of maintenance  of the time.

Relax OP I know that sounds kind of scary but the clutch is a wear item and  isnt going to cause it to shitout unless you ride the thing for minutes. Im just saying on a flat road you shouldnt need north of  to get it moving. Even on hills  is plenty sufficient for most cars. Dont stress about it too much OP Im in the same boat as you are. Learning to get better everyday just keep a good mindset and realize its just a learning experience and that no one was born clutch dumping out of their mothers womb.

GM is too careful about that.They really are trying to bring the Corvette to new heights though and after building a ZO that eclipses the previous ZR a new ZR replacement will need to be pretty special then. This midengined car would definitely be a way of doing that. GM has toyed around with the idea of an MR Corvette for many years so it could be that they finally have the confidence and processes to build it the way they want. Based on how the ZO already is I could see GM aiming for this car to be along the lines of the currently available starter hypercars like the Aventador and Huayracloser to the Pagani in performance while the PLaFerrari might be a little beyond it. A L V just wouldnt be GMs style though. A new generation LT with a strengthened LT architecture and a larger supercharger would yield the power needed. Maybe GM would even consider active aero on this Corvette. Technically the Cruze Eco has itjust bumper vents so why not the highest form of the companys halo car?The renderings depict this as likely being a comfortable and cleanly styled car. Maybe itd be a blank canvas and GM could also decide to go the hardcore route and make a track variant like the Zonda R and FXX with all kinds of vents a monster wing canards and diffusers.,cars,cnitqqs,7,t5_2qhl2

Go ask any turbo Subaru owner how much theirs burns and I think youll find its pretty common.Id rather not drop  grand on a repair of this magnitude if I can avoid it.

The basic jest of it is all repairs must be covered under the terms of the new car warranty unless the failure can be proven as a result of the installation or failure of the aftermarket product.  Extended Factory warranties will have the Manufacturers logo on them and are backed by the manufacturer as an extension of your factory coverage be careful though some finance managers will try to sell you an aftermarket service contract and they will call it an Extended Warranty.  Just make sure the MANUFACTURERS LOGO is on the warranty paperwork and you should be fine.With Ford their Extended coverage can be reviewed HERE that way you know what you want before you go in.,cars,cnjy7fk,2,t5_2qhl2

That and the german manufacturers dont seem overly concerned with less reliability they sell well enough without the need.gtwe are talking about a supra and the target demographic probably isnt too focused on reliabilityActually that was one of my requirements and it closed the doors on a ton of fast cars.  Resale was another and the cars reliability has a large impact on that.gtmaybe youre right about not needing to prove anything...but wasnt that what the LFA all about? sorta different situation there though hahaThat was more of an overstatement on my part for sure.  Theyre already at the top and Im not sure what theyd expect to gain at any rate.  The LFA on paper seems like a horrible bargain and yet it ranks near the top of the list for those that have actually driven one.  Definitely a different target audience though haha.

2823830,0,t1_cno5gb2,I have to take issue with this a bit because Ford was doing very well in  when the Focus made its debuts in Europe and NA respectively. The Focus was a shock to the compact market because it drove and handled miles better than anything Toyota and GM had and immediately made Honda and VW nervous. Yes the Corolla and Civic were in their prime but as soon as the Focus came out it was winning automotive awards left and right. It immediately became the secondbest selling compact in the US in  under the Civic and its rear suspension design made it handle better than a whole host of cars not even in its own segment.If anyone honestly believes the equivalent model from Ford was inferior to the Japanese brands in that era I am inclined to believe they are biased or uninformed. The One Ford strategy isnt a new one either its a respawn of what Ford was doing  years ago with the Focus and to some extent the ContourMondeo before it. ,cars,cnp2aj0,1,t5_2qhl2

2838954,0,t3_2of79i,Allow me to drunkenly ramble about my experience with the Prius. It drives like a sponge. The accel is great up hills and up to about mph. Never had an issue with onramps although I wish it had more power. There is some torque though. You can troll people and beat them at lights especially if theres a hill. I get a good laugh womping on Ford Rangers and stock VelostersPickupsSUVs and whatever else in general. the handling is horrible and the suspension is easily overwhelmed by the weight of the car which is has a surprisingly low center of gravity. It understeers when pushed and just kind of gives up as soon as you break traction. Its infuriating and whoever designed the TCS should burn in hell for thinking its ok to release a car that leaps forward because you ran over a small crack but wont allow you to drive with any spirit. Cargo space is fucking great. I can fit huge surfboards in with no problem. Camping gear hay bales  sleeping people etc. Comfort level is aight. There really is no comfortable driving position. The steering wheel is made for ants. The brake pedals always wiggle...Hard Eco tires are a joke and especially horrible in the wet. Narrow as shit and s doesnt help much. On a rough highway its loud as fuck inside and unbearable without laying your own weather proofing. The car never complains and runs on the crap we call gasoline.

If youve got  hp but you dont launch it like a drag car and only do roll racing itll likely be able to handle the power for longer than youd think especially if you get a little wheel spin. I do agree that they are like glass though and definitely an area where GM did took a cost cutting measure.  bolts or a  are suitable replacements that can take a beating. Theyre heavier than  bolts generally so theres some parasitic loss but theyll show better ETs due to their ability to handle the added power. Also borg warner did make Ts for fourth gens but they were sold to Tremec shortly after the LSs were put in. I forget an exact year off hand but I think it was sometime during the  model year. The Tremecs were basically identical even though some claim they werent of equal quality due to being produced in Mexico. ,cars,cnsmpvi,2,t5_2qhl2

No matter how much you clean a part after sand blasting or glass beading its still going to have those particulates embedded in the material that could fall out later.

2908810,0,t3_2tf5ji,Ive daily driven a  V and currently have a  GT. If youre looking for better gas mileage definitely go with a  V. Despite the irrational hate against them they are an enjoyable car to drive. They have decent power relatively good gas mileage and mine wasnt expensive to insure. As someone who has also driven fullsize sedans regularly I dont consider the Mustang to be a large car. That is obviously personal preference but I find them very easy to drive and live with since you can see out of them easily enough and being a common car you dont have to worry about it attracting too much attention. There is also a huge aftermarket for all types of Mustangs which is nice if you ever feel like personalizing the car. And finally if you want to meet up with other Mustang owners there are Mustang clubs all over the country and plenty of coolmature people who love to talk shop regardless if you own a V or a GT. ,cars,cnyqm0z,3,t5_2qhl2

2949045,0,t1_co3bdre,Thanks for the level headed response rather than just down voting me. I agree in a perfect world that dealerships would never have existed. But thats how it is now and everything is set up this way. I dont think it will change. Its easier for the manufacturer to just license different chains rather than incorporate sales into what they do. Plus its much easier for someone to physically see the car and try it out at a dealership rather than order from the manufacturer. And dealerships give you the opportunity to shop around for best price. You can get a car for invoice dealerships just dont want you to know that. Really they just need to sell X amount of cars to appease the manufacturer and keep their license. They can afford to basically make no profit on a couple new cars if it means a lifelong customer to their service division and another vehicle added to their sales number. Which they then can get bonuses from the factory which is great for the dealership so everyone wins.Dealerships really arent that bad. People that dont do their research before buying then get mad at dealerships are what gives them a bad name at least in my opinion.Source Im the photographer at a local dealership and I get to see a lot behind the scenes. Also we employ so many people great people mostly in the community. Cant forget dealerships add a lot of jobs.,cars,co3bjq1,2,t5_2qhl2

Besides the difficult task of getting an entirely new division off the ground theyd have to tackle the issue of reconciling their current Mazda division with a luxury division and lower the quality of their current cars to put some separation between the two.  With the average entry luxury brand car coming in around k thats not far removed from a top trim Mazda  hatch at k with just the appearance package.  They would either have to cut the price and quality of cars at those trim levels or arbitrarily inflate the prices of their luxury brand while using the same platforms which would price them out of the market unless they went full on Cadillac and made everything expensive.

Going downtown? Grab the Metro. Going to the burbs or countryside? Take the car. Compare that to NYC where public transit is pretty much the only way to go unless you like paying the equivalent of another apartments rent on insurance and garaging for your car. Then compare that to where I live now Fort Worth where its quite cheap to own a car but you have to use one for almost everything.

With turbos it would be easier to make the Type R substantially more powerful. See the upcoming Civic Type R as an example said to have at least hp from its L turbo whereas even the last Civic Type R had hp from a naturallyaspirated L and Mugen models had hp and hp.L concept. The new NSX is already going to be a huge leap over the previous model in terms of power and it will be easy for Honda to tune the engine further for a new Type R.,cars,cohbx47,5,t5_2qhl2
3081297,0,t1_coh759w,So couple of things missing from the Newibies post and a couple of notes. The reason why your car cant get unstuck is probably because the system works only when the car is being turned. With ESC on throttle is reduced to shift the weight forward and reduce understeer but you dont want that when you are trying to get unstuck so im guessing you turn the ESC off. However you can simulate the lsd operation somewhat by giving it left foot brake gently and adding throttle  this tends to equalize the drive force on both wheels at the expense of higher brake pad wear. I used to drive my  mirage like this with an open diff all the time in the snow every time I would take a corner I would left foot brake while keeping constant throttle and both wheels would spin and pull the car in the direction it wants to go. Additionally your car torsion rear suspension is actually exactly what is needed for FWD cars. If you were to upgrade the rear torsion bar with a stiff one you would notice that the car turns much sharper because more weight gets put onto your front wheels and the rear outside tire gets more loaded and will step out earlier. Its the reason fiesta and focus ST are very tail happy. ,cars,cohdhmn,7,t5_2qhl2

3132713,0,t3_2w0zki,I second uverdegrrls recommendations  she has purchased lots of vehicles in the past including some exotics so shes speaking from experience.I just thought Id amplify a bit because it sounds like you havent purchased a car before. Realize that if youre trading in and buying the dealer has  aspects of the deal to play with. He might come down on the price of your new car but then drive a harder bargain on your tradein for example. Realize that even if you manage to negotiate a dealer down to their invoice price on a car theyre still making money. There are special rebates called dealer holdbacks that dont show on the invoice. Trying to buy a car on the last day or two of the month can sometimes yield a better deal manufacturers often have incentives structured so that if a dealer sells X of a given car they get a bonus. If the dealer is close to one of these incentives they will sometimes suddenly become much more cooperative. You cant count on this though. Consider using a car buying service. You can get cars through Costo or Truecar.com for less than MSRP. The price you get wont be as good as if you spend hours playing dealers against each other and negotiating in the showroom but people have different tolerances for haggling. If you dislike it it might be worth it to you to get a decent although not rock bottom nohaggle price. ,cars,compcak,2,t5_2qhl2

Not trying to rain on your parade but I see a lot of people who put themselves in a huge hole buying way too much car.

3197390,0,t3_2wquq2,Best would be when I was doing  on a stretch of highway that was divided but mph. Cop pulls me over tells me I was going way too fast asks for my info and heads back to the car. He comes back a few minutes later with no ticket in his hand and Im so excited. He then says gt Today is your lucky day. The computer system is down and I dont want to find my ticket book. Worst would be the time I was pulled over because I parked in front of a house they were monitoring for a drug bust and ended up with a couple bullshit tickets. I pulled over to check my phone and then got side tracked and went on facebook then reddit then watched a  video and finally got back on the road. Two cops pull up behind me and one asks me where I am going but never says I did anything wrong. I ask why Im being pulled over and he says because of suspicious activity and I didnt signal a turn. Bullshit! I hadnt taken a turn in miles. Then he keeps asking me what Im doing my story stays the same because its true so then he starts making shit up about seeing or smelling alcohol. Bitch please its PM and I hadnt had anything to drink in days. Then he asks me to get out of the car and I pass the sobriety test and he says he sees something in my nose. At this point I am pissed and tell him its snot and I am done with this and ready to go home. Now they want to search my car and I say no they dont have a warrant or probable cause. He tries anyway and I tell him to get the fuck away from my car and if he even touches the interior hes going to hear from my lawyer. Now piggies are pissed and they say theyll write me up for everything they can think of if I dont let them search my car. I tell them I want that in writing because I know theyre scum. Yes I called the cops scum. Then they start telling me theyre going to put me in the squad car because they know what I did and I tell them driving a car with tint isnt a crime and they can fuck off. They finally give up and tell me to get in my car and wait for them to give me a ticket. They had to dig through all their crap to find the ticket book and when they finally get to my car I get one for not signalling a turn for not having my inspection up to date and having tint. The tint was legal there was no turn and they missed all the other crap wrong with the car. I fought them in court and even though I got stuck with the turn signal I made the cop come in on his day off and listen to every single detail I could think of for over an hour. Well that turned into a rant and the writing sucks. Whatever. ,cars,coteqnw,11,t5_2qhl2

3199981,0,t3_2wry61,Most cars actually generate mild net lift at speeds simply due to the basic shape of a car with a curved upper portion hood roof trunk and a flat underside. Theres more to it than that but typically it takes the inclusion of specific aerodynamic elements just to simply ensure that this lift is not present due to its destabilizing effect. There is no positive effect to producing lift on a car if it creates additional drag rolling resistance ltlt drag force at any speed high enough for aerodynamics to be important but a very aerodynamic and smooth shape might naturally produce a little lift if its not corrected.,cars,cotoejw,5,t5_2qhl2

He doesnt really notice any difference between the two. Why does he drive the E? He claims its because mercedes is better but really its because he can afford it and his new wife convinced him to stop being a cheapass. Left to himself hed still be driving another toyota. Or maybe a honda or hyundai. He is NOT a luxury buyer.And if you asked her shed give the same excuses. But again its really because she likes to look good and impress people.

3209479,0,t3_2wvz6y,I drive a smart car on occasion and live on a hill. The lower  or  yard of the hill are at a decent grade and being in Chicagoland we get a decent amount of snow now and then. The thing has really narrow tires is RWD and has a grand total of  hp. I found a workaround to disable traction control which allows me to get up the hill nearly every time although I do sometimes need a running start.Basically what disabling the traction control does is it lets you continue giving power to the wheels even when youre slipping a bit letting you get that last little but of distance at a nonideal acceleration. With traction control on the instant you start slipping your power is cut.Id say get snow tires. Wider rims and tires might help too but thats significantly more expensive and probably not necessary.,cars,countup,2,t5_2qhl2

And the problem is you cant simply innovate a car like this on the run like yeah lets put a electric engine in it or lets make a lighter chassis. They would need to build a brand new car and that is what their doing.

3230049,0,t3_2x4i5f,inb Miata BRZ...My real answer is the Ariel Atom.I dont mean to say that the Atom isnt an awesome thing.  It is.  But I think the amount of hype and attention it gets is more due to a video of lots of wind in Jeremy Clarksons face than about real opinions of the car itself.Ive driven an Atom personally at VIR.  It is lightweight.  It is fast.  It has extremely crisp handling.  It has an engine that loves to rev and sings beautifully.  And it brakes hard.  It seems impossible not to love this car... but IMO its too difficult to drive at the limit for most people and in this case that includes me.The difficulty comes from the weight distribution  it has the same issue as a  which is that the weight is concentrated at the rear of the car.  This isnt a bad thing for setting performance numbers but it is a bad thing for how easy it is to reach those numbers when youre not an expert racing driver.  The car is just too unstable on corner entry.  Rather than giving you confidence to brake deeper on the next lap it scares you away from finding the limits.There was a time in my life when I planned to own an Atom someday.  Now I plan to own an Exocet instead.  It will be slower than an Atom but it will be cheaper and easier to drive and more fun for me.,cars,cowst0a,5,t5_2qhl2

3249898,0,t3_2x9v1p,I feel its something people actually dont want. As nice as it would be for everyone to have a dashcam and every collision could quickly be determined whos at fault. People dont want their own cars tattling on them.Ive got two itronics in my car front and back. And worst case if I get in an at fault accident I can say they are off and best case get  blame worst  blame. However in having the two dashcams Ive become somewhat of a safer driver knowing they record my actions.While in a world where everyone has a dash can in their car. It becomes big brotheresque. Everyone will naturally drive safer due to the fact that if they cause a collision there will be incriminating video that it was their fault. Again ask how many people want their car to record audiovideoand location and possibly get their insurance raised because of it and a lot will not want it. Its the same with  insurance company in Canada who provides a module you plug in the ODB port of your car. And they drop your insurance cost .

3265587,0,t3_2xfx76,Ive had my license for like  months now. I drive  grand cherokee and im in Minnesota. I have the shittiest of the shit all seasons. my dads  wheel drive truck with all seasons gets better traction than me. So as I tend to do on every corner when there is snow out I drift like a motherfucker. Being  I know this sounds so ignorant but Im actually very good at it and not just in my car but my friends cars and relatives cars. This happened about  months after I got my license. I had some friends in the car after leaving school and was in the neighborhood going to one of my friends house to drop them off. Drifting every spot in sight I came upon a  degree bend so I whipped it fairly good but to too hard. Held it for a while everything was going good. Hit a small patch of ice and it made my front tires loose traction. I didnt spin out but I could no longer control how I was sliding. The grillehood of my car ended up hitting a  box mailbox. The box shook back and the newspaper flew out of them. The mail box was completely fine so I just drove off. Got to my friends house and checked for any damage to the vehicle. Part of the chrome grille turned into aluminum foil and part of the hood got pushed in and cracked a small portion of paint. The damage was from the wood piece that the mailbox sits on top of. The metal part of the mailbox itslef left a very small and light scratch on half of the hood. It will buff out very easily. As for the grille I sanded it down and plasti dipped it black and put a bug deflector on the hood so the cracked paint and pushed in hood is not noticeable what so ever. Overall we had a pretty good laugh as it has been the only time I have hit something drifting.,cars,cp0i59p,1,t5_2qhl2

I bought it when I was in my early s actually didnt do much to it the first few years I owned it first mod was the JDM shift boot and RSX speed shift knob. I started with the lug conversion and it just snow balled from there. Suspension is the HFP kit the knuckles and LCA are from a RSXS replaced the original lug. Rear mm sway bar JDM front sway KA  JDM exhaust manifolddownpipe  RSXS midpipe. A few misc. JDMEDM parts here and there cigarette lighter ashtray cupholdersconsole shift boot etc.The headlights are from a LHD Type R also have a pair of  LHD EPR lights that I used back in the day the wheels are off a CSXS actually bought these for only  for all  several years ago.Like I said I would love to hang on to the car but Im ready to get a door hatch with a little more go...something I can just be happy with in stock form without spending a ton of money on modifying. Hoping the person I end up selling it to appreciates it and someday ends up putting in a KA or KA.As for the white hood Im not really feeling it just looks like your car was in an accident or something. I think the EP is one of those cars that requires a lot of careful modding in its stock form it looks pretty bad extended bumpers with orangered reflectors so I think it would be best to try and either source some JDMEDM bumpers or if you can find one the HFP kit isnt too bad. Check out some of the sellers from the UK on eBay I got my EPR rear bumperlip for around  shipped and just had a place create a rebar for me out of steel.

3289893,0,t1_cp39q1z,Roll cage is an absolutely good thing to have for safety.  When you are going for a record you can easily roll a car at which point it can easily flip over the embankment and go down a hill. You can look at plenty of car crashes where the driver walks away unharmed because of the roll cage. And I can totally see a roll cage being about the same weight as the removed components. As for parasitic drag having no AC doesnt really decrease it anymore than running it. The drag difference between the two is minimal. As long as the outside is the same you will have similar drag. You will see the final result when they run the production car again. ,cars,cp39vqe,0,t5_2qhl2

It doesnt legally count as running a red unless the light turned red before your car was in the intersection  if any part of your car has passed into the intersection while the light was still yellow youre not doing anything illegal.

Seems silly to Neutral gt coast gt shift to gear gt accelerate Regardless of what you feel like it can be said to be safer to remain in gear.  I understand you feel comfortable doing it.  As do many many people driving stick.  But you cant argue it isnt technically better.

When I had my  every time it happened it was a week or two wait for parts now they just have them in stock and they get my car back to me in  hours.  My service advisor said they see about  cars a week fairly busy city dealership for the issue and I am the only one hes seen regularly i doubt that but I dont doubt a lot of cars get fixed and run fine. but I know im not the only one with repeating issues.  If its a CEL in an F engine its an OCV.I have taken my NA in pretty much routinely for the issue every  miles  about .  I asked subaru NA the costs of parts and labor I told them that  every  miles is a cost of ownership I cannot afford after warranty is out I cant in my right mind keep a car with a maintenance requirement like that hah.edit I am just glad I am not one of the lucky owners burning several quarts of oil every  miles because a batch of piston rings werent engineered to spec.  Or those with a CVT thats failing catastrophically from the early gens.the F series engine is still young its only been in cars since ish? it needs a few more years to be a solid platform IMO.  If youre planning to own the car and trade it before warranty is out which is why there probably arent a lot of complaints about these issues do it.  If you plan on owning the car long term id wait a few more years for the kinks to be worked out.

3346905,0,t1_cp9ia7f,My family runsran an exotic car rental business for  years so this is my take on some of your questions.gt In what circumstance would the rental company not know the driver?New customers basically. You always make sure to verify everything including getting copies of driver licenses credit cards everything and running it under black lights etc. Also ensure to get faxedemailed copies of proof of coverage from the insurance company prior to releasing the vehicle.gt How much due diligence is actually performed i.e. copies of the drivers license etc taken prior to rental? For new customers I always verified insurance through their carrier. Id pull a greater authorizationdeposit on the credit card for new customers too. Having credit card release forms and copies of driver license credit cards insurance etc is a must  of the time on  of the vehicles whether you rent a C or a Drophead.gt Are there different types of coverage when it comes to rental? Can the onus fall entirely on the at fault renter? We can sell coverage on exotics but its expensive. Collision is something from  to  daily though if youre really renting an exotic Im going to assume you have the financial backing or at least a credit card that will cover a K vehicle. Liability is cheaper and i have no problem selling it.gt If the renter is liable how do you go about collecting? Insurance. The company screwed up big time if they didnt secure insurance coverage prior to renting the car. If they did sell coverage then theyll go in and charge the customer whatever deductible they set and insurance pays the balance to company.gt How much do you typically have to pay for the vehicles with respect to insurance?As a company or as a renter? I believe we pay an average of  per vehicle for our coverage. I can whack a renter up to  daily on the Aventador but I hardly ever sell insurance on exotics.

The s was new no problem as well as recommended I test drive an a which I told them I wasnt even considering just to cover all my options and I hated the A after driving it. The s cars are not that rare but I can understand no test drives of the RS models. Yes if you pull up in a  year old civic they are not going to treat you the same as if you schedule an appointment beforehand to test drive the car and show up in a  year old BMWLexus. They key is calling ahead instead of just showing up. Essentially the dealer sniffed out that you werent  set on buying a car from them despite the fact you had cash cash is actually a negative in buyingnegotiating for a car dealerships make more money if they can sign you up for financing... And he was proven correct because you walked out without buying anything. The majority of people that come in to a dealership to test drive DONT buy anything. That being said the only test drives my audi dealership offers are a short less than  mile loop basically on and off the freeway for  mile and then a little less than  miles at city speeds in stop and go with the salesman in the passenger seat.

The dealer may hang on to that car for an extra month but a  mile test drive is basically guaranteeing him a sale.If I showed up even in the husbands Jaguar Id likely be turned down. What dealer in their right mind would let an early  something drive a sports car. It would be even less likely if I showed up in a muscle car or another Corvette.

3400613,0,t3_2z3814,Hey there I currently work for a Chevy dealership and purchased a brand new C from a totally different dealership last year.  In my experience its true that we and most dealers try to keep miles on Vettes and higher end Camaros very low. This means sales staff cant demo them and neither could a customer off the street. Well sorta. Even though I work for a Chevy dealer before I bought my car Id never driven a C either. Heres how our dealership and the dealership I bought my car from work. You show up and say youre interested in a C. I do a full walk around on the car with you go over all the features different options figure out what youre looking for and so on. You say youre cross shopping the Vette with car A and car B and youd like to drive it so you can make an informed decision. At this point its really up to management. Yes theyre going to judge you. Theyre going to look at what you drove up in what youre wearing how you speak etc. I agree its stupid. I agree that you should never judge a book by its cover however at the end of the day they just want to make sure youre serious and not just trying to take the car for a joyride. After all while its not a LaFerrari or a P its still easily a k car with very likely no miles on it. Youd be amazed by how many people just want to come in and drive a new Vette for fun. In my case I had already submitted a credit app online and the dealership I was working with knew I had the credit and income to purchase the car. When I showed up we negotiated numbers and before I signed I was able to test drive the car. My advice to you is to let the dealership know youre serious. Ask for a sales manager. Theyll probably want to discuss how youre planning on purchasing the car financing vs paying cash term of the loan payment or check etc. Once most dealerships feel comfortable with you theyll probably agree to let you drive the car. I know you were able to test a McLaren but you have to remember that it was still a preowned car. Youd be amazed by how picky many Vette buyers can be about miles on new cars. Hell I lost a sale on a new Z because the client wouldnt buy it if it had more than  miles on it. The car had  Im the first person to say that I felt like the customer was being a little ridiculous but when youre spending that much money on a car I guess you have the right to be. The value of even a used McClaren isnt going to change much if youve put an additional two miles on it  but those two miles could be the difference between selling a brand new Vette or seeing the customers walk. ,cars,cpfw96b,1,t5_2qhl2

3423360,0,t1_cpiahr1,Ill throw out there also to urwbronco  that the word drilled is often inaccurate. There definitely are drilled rotors but they are typically horrible quality  solidlycast rotors that are later drilled for ventilation  friction. Those drilled rotors are the ones that will most frequently show cracks around the drilled holes.  What youre more typically seeing in production brakes  is cross ventilated rotors which are not drilled but rather cast with the crossventilation holes already inplace. and generally wont show cracks around the ventilation holesBack in the s the pad compounds had not yet figured out the gas generation issue  basically the friction between the pad and the rotor would create gas which would float the pad much like a puck on an airhockey table. The solution was drilling rotors and later crossventilated rotors which would vent the gas generated by the pad into the cooling chambers of the rotor. These days high performance pads have very low gas generation properties so drilling or crossventilation is not as big an issue. That said crossventilated rotors also had higher friction properties so you could get better brake bite at high temps and also performed better in the wet when you had another gasproducing compound present water so came the advent of slotted rotors. Slotted rotors have all of the current benefits of crossventilated drilled rotors with few of the drawbacks. You might also see crescent rotors too  they have similar properties of slots with better pad wear properties. My fav vendor of these is Alcon what I run on my DD. ,cars,cpihl4x,2,t5_2qhl2

Radar guided cruise control on a Mercedes uses  sensors in the front I think. Theyve had this system for  years. Introduced in . It brakes for you speeds up for you and goes up to the speed limit. It can come to a complete stop at a traffic line and emergency brake with all these sensors. Its been doing that for  years. Now its at a point where Mercedes have improved it enough to run in a self driving car along with more sensors software and controls to handle every part of driving.gtSpeeds on the highway might be quicker but they still have corners and no robot can make you not go flying off a cliff. Again cruise control in todays car already have systems to keep you in your lane without having to steer so it can judge how sharp a bend is and slow down to make that corner. If every car is doing this theyll all speed up to mph then all slow as they come to the same corner all to the same speed and then speed up again.gtIf an animal jumps out in front of your car what will you do?I dont think you know how far the tech is already. This issue was solved years go. The car brakes for you in an emergency. Emergency brake assist is a thing you brake a little it uses its sensors to figure out how close something is and brakes harder if need be.

But these guys do this all the time and all they are doing while they drive is look for things that go wrong. The line between point of no return and optimum traction to the rear wheels is really fine hence wheelie bars and with all the vibration it would be hard for a computer to tell especially because that point changes with speed and wind conditions. The solution as I said is better aero not some system that could either send a false alarm or see something as a false alarm when there is real danger. Sure a computer could react faster but I still think it would be in vain. Its just another thing to fail.

Overspray everywhere orange peel everywhere and on top of that they didnt fix any of the dents or rust bubbles. My dad got irate and had a manager walk through it to show him everything that they missed that we paid for and while looking at a rust bubble on one of the doors the manager pushed his finger through it and popped a hole in the door. He immediately stepped away and said Thats not my fault that was already there. Were not liable for it and from then on they just absolutely stonewalled any further resolution.

3468153,0,t1_cpnigw4,well of course! engineer here.. lol the pressure differential across a compressor is dependent upon the work given to the fluid. Work given to the compressor goes to heat inneficiencies power loss and putting work into the fluid itself in this case air and the work is done by moving it to an area of higher potentialpressure working against a gradientmoving air from a zone of low pressure to an area of higher pressure  If you remove that gradient it does a little work in moving the air but you have removed the bulk of the work the compressor is doing. In essence the car will take power from the crank to turn the SC to create some bigger bangs which help spool the turbo at  rpm instead of  rpm as this turbo would normally at which point it starts making the same or a little more boost but does it more efficiently as now the work being put into the fluid intake air is coming from waste exhaust energy turbine on the turbo vs crank power that could otherwise be going to the wheels supercharger In a way it is like a exhaust and turbine friendly form of lowend antilag.

Furthermore yes those manufacturers will become bigger but not by much relatively. They already have departments across a lot of different fields. The system is already there to take over dealers. Also when you have the consumer directly influencing design the manufacturer can develop a much better product based on consumer wantsneeds. Also the cutting down middle man costs allows manufacturers to charge higher than normal msrp for a car becuase the market is already higher the msrp and  put that money into better engineered products.

3523924,0,t3_30n32r,Go ahead and pull the fuse for the courtesy lights if you havent already. They will act up at some point and can drain the battery. Also theres little black plungers in the door jams just unscrew them pull them out of the holes and unplug them because they will malfunction and cause your alarm to go off. Probably a good idea to watch the rear main seal as well because it can develop leaks if youre not careful. Best plugs are either factory spec NGKs or Champion Copper Plus. Do not use Bosch parts if you can help it Jeep electrical systems in general seem to not like them. Use BWD Mopar or Standard Motor Products for any sensors that break and trust me they will break if theyre the originals. Also clean that throttle body el nowo. A clean throttle body is a happy throttle body especially inside the hole for the idle air control valve. A Haynes manual for it can be found at just about any auto parts store and is well worth it. A good oil to use is Valvoline Synthetic Blend W and a Mobil  filter and for the transmission use ONLY ATF. ATF and Dexron will murder your gearbox.I do hope this info will help you and I hope you grow to love your ZJ as much as I do!,cars,cptyb23,2,t5_2qhl2

3578531,0,t1_cq053r3,The APA source emphatically condemns corporal punishment in all cases youe just really good at cherry picking. Did you just quit reading after that nice little quote? Because its followed with this gtUnfortunately all research on parent discipline is going to be correlational because we cant randomly assign kids to parents for an experiment. But I dont think we have to disregard all research that has been done she says. I can just about count on one hand the studies that have found anything positive about physical punishment and hundreds that have been negative.Other gems you ignored includegtspanking doesnt work says Alan Kazdin PhD a Yale University psychology professor and director of the Yale Parenting Center and Child Conduct Clinic. You cannot punish out these behaviors that you do not want says Kazdin who served as APA president in . There is no need for corporal punishment based on the research. We are not giving up an effective technique. We are saying this is a horrible thing that does not work.gtOn the international front physical discipline is increasingly being viewed as a violation of childrens human rights. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child issued a directive in  calling physical punishment legalized violence against children that should be eliminated in all settings through legislative administrative social and educational measures. The treaty that established the committee has been supported by  countries with only the United States and Somalia failing to ratify it.gtPhysical punishment doesnt work to get kids to comply so parents think they have to keep escalating it. That is why it is so dangerous Elizabeth Gershoff PhD a leading researcher on physical punishment at the University of Texas at Austin says. After reviewing decades of research Gershoff wrote the Report on Physical Punishment in the UnitedHealth StatesWhat Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children published in  in conjunction with Phoenix Childrens Hospital. The report recommends that parents and caregivers make every effort to avoid physical punishment and calls for the banning of physical discipline in all U.S. schools. The report has been endorsed by dozens of organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics American Medical Association and Psychologists for Social Responsibility.gtChildren who were physically punished were more likely to endorse hitting as a means of resolving their conflicts with peers and siblings. Parents who had experienced frequent physical punishment during their childhood were more likely to believe it was acceptable and they frequently spanked their children. Their children in turn often believed spanking was an appropriate disciplinary method.gtAPA supports parents use of nonphysical methods of disciplining children and opposes the use of severe or injurious physical punishment of any child.I honestly believe that you are mentally incapable of providing any legitimate insight into this discussion and I feel bad for you.

3586772,0,t1_cq14b6i,ampampamp Bathtub curve sfw gtgtThe bathtub curve is widely used in reliability engineering It describes a particular form of the hazard function which comprises three partsgtgt The first part is a decreasing failure rate known as early failuresgt The second part is a constant failure rate known as random failures.gt The third part is an increasing failure rate known as wearout failures.gtThe name is derived from the crosssectional shape of a bathtub steep sides and a flat bottom.gtThe bathtub curve is generated by mapping the rate of early infant mortality failures when first introduced the rate of random failures with constant failure rate during its useful life and finally the rate of wear out failures as the product exceeds its design lifetime.gtIn less technical terms in the early life of a product adhering to the bathtub curve the failure rate is high but rapidly decreasing as defective products are identified and discarded and early sources of potential failure such as handling and installation error are surmounted. In the midlife of a productgenerally once it reaches consumersthe failure rate is low and constant. In the late life of the product the failure rate increases as age and wear take their toll on the product. Many consumer product life cycles strongly exhibit the bathtub curve such as computer processors citation neededgtWhile the bathtub curve is useful not every product or system follows a bathtub curve hazard function for example if units are retired or have decreased use during or before the onset of the wearout period they will show fewer failures per unit calendar time not per unit use time than the bathtub curve.gtThe term Military Specification is often used to describe systems in which the infant mortality section of the bathtub curve has been burned out or removed. This is done mainly for life critical or system critical applications as it greatly reduces the possibility of the system failing early in its life. Manufacturers will do this at some cost generally by means similar to environmental stress screeninggtIn reliability engineering the cumulative distribution function corresponding to a bathtub curve may be analysed using a Weibull chart citation neededgtgtImage i  The bathtub curve hazard function blue upper solid line is a combination of a decreasing hazard of early failure red dotted line and an increasing hazard of wearout failure yellow dotted line plus some constant hazard of random failure green lower solid line.Interesting Failure rate | Bathtub | Shakedown testing | Burnin Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqbxs oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecqbxs.

3694791,0,t3_32piwa,To be a fart cannon all you need is a big exhaust tip. Thats enough to get you more noise and there are zero functional benefits.You can get a muffler with a large tip as well. It might yield more noise but thats about it.Next is an axleback exhaust. It can improve some exhaust flow since theres room for some piping ahead of the muffler but it still isnt much of a difference.A catback gives you some added piping up to the catalytic converter thats usually near the midpoint of the exhaust. You can pick up some power here but it varies depending on how well the new exhaust flows and how bad the old one was. Many people stop here since they might be concerned with passing any emissions testing since the catalytic converter plays a large role in that. Some will change their converters too for a mild benefit.The next stage is the downpipe. This connects to the catalytic converter and gets you one step closer to the engine specifically to the exhaust manifold. Some will use these in serach of that last bit of improved flow but others may skip it if theyre concerned about potentially removing some emissions equipment.The exhaust manifold collects exhaust gases from each cylinder and combines the piping to route it into the exhaust. Many modern exhaust manifolds feature precats or smaller catalytic converters that are for the sake of emissions especially on engine startup where emissions can temporarily be higher. Many replace the exhaust manifold with headers that offer better flow typically eliminate precats and may feature altered routing to take further advantage of underhood space and even the cylinder firing order. The headers are the section that usually begins to bend underneath the car. In turbocharged cars the turbo is mounted onto the exhaust manifold since it is powered by the flow of exhaust gases.A welldesigned exhaust will minimize bends and the bends it does have will be gentle for the sake of flow. The piping will have to be properly sized as well. Going too small can restrict flow and sacrifice some power. Going too large can reduce the velocity of exhaust gases which causes issues with scavenging or the removal of waste gas from the engine so that it can be replaced by the fresh intake charge of air and fuel. A sidebenefit of an exhaust upgrade can be weight savings. Good stainlesssteel exhausts can save a few pounds. Some exhausts for highperformance sports cars and supercars are made from titanium saving even more weight but at a greater cost.,cars,cqdfil5,94,t5_2qhl2

I helped him with a brake job once but other than that he changed the oil and that was it. He ended up selling it for about  a few years ago to some kid whom kept driving it but my understanding was nd gear was starting to slip from time to time and I attribute that to having never changed the gear oil during his ownership from about K till K. I have a feeling a gear oil drain and fill would probably have resolved that issue. He also had the rear main seal was leaking very slowly his solution was to put in a liter of oil every few thousand miles. Simply put it was a great car and you made a fantastic purchase on a car that frequently gets overlooked enjoy it and maintain it! and it will be there for you for years to come. ,cars,cqeaczj,2,t5_2qhl2

3717023,0,t1_cqffe9h,gt I partially subscribe to the theory that German vehicles arent as unreliable as people claim.VWs are every bit as unreliable as people claim. Every VW Ive ever seen or heard anything about had abysmal reliability. My ex had a Jetta that was just comically unreliable and it had big expensive problems. I have story about it written up Ill try to find it. My grandparents had a caretaker who drove a Golf and she said she was always having problems. The one problem she mentioned was excessive wear on the cam lobes which resulted in her car being basically undrivable.  Her husband had a matching Golf with a matching cam problem.One of my cousins married a guy who doesnt know jackshit about cars but loves VWs. His car I dont remember what it was left them stranded on a  mile road trip. VWs are just junk I cant say much about the other German brands.Edit Found it.My ex had a  Jetta VR this is a very quickly written story about it. First it was always throwing error codes indicating that the mass air flow sensor was bad. Replaced it nothing changed. Out of money did nothing. A few months later VW had a recall because of an ECU software problem related to the mass airflow sensor. Error codes cease in other words we threw away money on a part we didnt need. Next the radiator decides to blow off a chunk of plastic half as big as my hand. Turns out the radiator fan was bad and apparently the temp gauge doesnt indicate if the car is overheating it always seemed to work fine. Replaced the radiator and fan. Dealing mostly with Hondas all of my adult life I was shocked at the cost of parts. Then everything seemed fine until a file cabinet drawer fell off of the back of a truck unable to avoid it it went under the front of the car and cracked the oil pan. It turns out VW unlike most manufacturers doesnt like to put ANYTHING at the front of the car to protect the radiator or engine from debris. The ENTIRE front of the car is plastic. Its like VW is inviting serious damage. This also makes a HUGE job of jacking up the car because there is NOTHING in the front to jack it up with just a giant piece of useless plastic! Replaced the oil pan another big chunk of cash. Every once in a while the throttle position sensor would act up causing the car to accelerate randomly and thankfully briefly. I opened it up and cleaned the contacts and it worked fine thereafter. While repairing the radiator I found out that VW likes to use REALLY cheap plastic tees in their cooling system LOTS of them. While pulling hoses off to get to the coolant drain plug on the engine one of the tees broke BRITTLE AS HELL. Then while pulling out the broken tee another tee broke! Called VW one tee  . Let me just repeat that NINETY DOLLARS! Trip to Home Depot replaced one of the tees for about THREE bucks! Glued the other one and it always leaked a bit. The interior also had more problems than I can remember. After the oil pan fix the VW was traded in for a  Honda Civic its been nearly flawless. A couple of the door lock actuators have failed but thats it. Shes had it for  years and put  miles on it it has k and the drivetrain is still solid as a rock. It hasnt needed anything other than filter and fluid changes and a timing belt.,cars,cqfytr4,6,t5_2qhl2

3766520,0,t1_cqle9cq,Afaik they didnt have studio recordings for these episodes only the pre recorded segments. This means that each of the episodes only has like half the content done and I dont think they have any way to properly show the half that is done without a host and Clarkson wasnt fired he just didnt have his contract renewed. I think it could go either way you have to remember that Clarkson made Top Gear what it was he wasnt just the host or personality he was a coowner of top gear and did a lot of behind the scenes work on the show and despite several higher ups at BBC wanting him out there are many people who support him. Even if they dont want him on set I think they need to let him come on for the shows sake. If they end this saga on a decent note it may help them earn back fans for the new top gear. As it stands right now a lot of fans arent happy and releasing these episodes without clarkson or all  is just going to put this bitter taste back in their mouths.,cars,cqlm0yr,4,t5_2qhl2

3767711,0,t1_cqlma8d,You are possibly the only person Ive ever seen say that Forza would be better without upgrades and tuning...You realise you solved your own problem right? If you stop upgrading them then you have nothing to worry about  its a choice. The upgrading in Forza is fantastic. One of my favorite aspects of the franchise. The idea of only being able to buy stock cars is laughable to me. I spend most of my time in Forza upgrading and tuning cars. Some nights I might feel like a built na  next night I might want to chuck a turbo on the stock engine and give it better tyres next a jz drift monster what about a v drag car? Thats already increased my playability x! If you couldnt upgrade cars where would be the incentive to buy multiple Supras or what have you? I own  versions of most cars all done up for different styles of driving. Online racing would be boring as hell with stock cars. A class race? Better get that stock A class Ferrari that everyone uses because its clearly the best in the class and no other car compares. S class race? At least with upgrades and tuning their is variety. Sorry for the rant but if you dont like it dont use them. No one forces you to upgrade or tune your cars. At the end of the day id bet at least  of Forza players would prefer upgradestuning than stock cars. ,cars,cqlqwe9,2,t5_2qhl2

Its important on pieces of the ring although the straights are more important regarding ultimate lap time for example. Its also more efficient to make tunnels under mountains than roads over them... amortized decently. PMy perspective as someone who does chassis engineering is that ultimately the one thing you cant modify enough is removal of weight. assuming youre steadfast in fatigue and peak loadingI would like to see one of the car magazines pick a tire like As for  of their tests to even the field and make the tests about geometry and weight instead of the OEMs tire choices. ,cars,cqoh8wi,1,t5_2qhl2

A teardown shows a primary metering block full of Dr. Pepper soda. I took the metering block off and it spilled out all over my toolbox. Still tasted like Dr. Pepper.

Which is where it would have sunk. Nobody would have found it. Successful insurance fraud.Instead they broke the windows. This caused it to sink just off shore and get stuck. Someone from the highway saw the lights in the water which I guess turned on when the car went into the water. You could see it underwater clearly during the day So insurance fraud failed.Then again the car has FL license plates so no surprise there. ,cars,cquyp27,3,t5_2qhl2

It still could be  but having a lower deductible on comprehensive insurance is actually very inexpensive. Going from  to  on my insurance only increased my premium by  a month. This very same thing happened to me about  months ago some guy keyed my car over a parking space. My insurance took care of the repair for my comprehensive coverage which was a  deductible.Collision deductibles only apply for when you are driving the car if you werent behind the wheel nor was anybody else of your car its not considered collision.  ,cars,cqxw0xq,1,t5_2qhl2

If they had similar brakes the STI would have came out faster meaning the drivetrain is actually superior. gt They had IDENTICAL times in the  and at that level of driving it wont make a large difference so its fair to say that is barely much of a difference. Lol in the article you referenced Randy Pobst even says the DSG attributed to the faster times.gt What I am saying is that you calling the drive train inferior is wrong when it is capable of performing the same better or slightly behind the STIEvo. Basically it is on par with the two that dominated it at a similar price range AWD drive train better interior and gas mileage than both so in a sense yes an overall better car. We were on the discussion of MPG which relates to street driven cars then you take off on rallying.The reason I brought up rallying is to explain why the Golf gets better fuel economy. The drivetrains were designed with different goals in mind one is daily driven economy Golf and the other rally racing WRXEvo. From a performancetechnical standpoint the Golfs AWD is still inferior. Not only does the WRXEvo shine on tarmac but its spanks ass on snowicegravel. The Golf gives that up in the name of fuel economy.,cars,cr1u5zp,0,t5_2qhl2

3941964,0,t3_35khi1,Great information from the OP. On the subject of usedold car purchasing I dont think people hammer home how valuable service history is especially when it comes to enthusiast cars. If you are like me and drive something from the last century then most likely mileage isnt your biggest concern maintenance is.As someone else mentioned in the tread check out the forum for your specific MakeModelGeneration. Nine out of ten times the forum is going to have a sticky thread covering what to look out for.  Even enthusiasts dont always check every piece of rubber in their suspension or do preventative maintenance replacing every fluid at the right intervals. Depending on the age of the car you will get a pretty good idea of the cars condition if you have a nice stack of receipts to look through. EDIT  Decided to add some more as I had a few more thoughts especially for the guys on here buying their first car. Obviously you should try to do a PPI prepurchase inspection before purchasing a used car. Use an independent third party or a mechanic you know and trust if you are local. Forums can also sometimes help you with finding someone if you are making a trip for a specific car. The next biggest thing you can do is arm yourself with the knowledge of the common weaknesses of the car. If the PO doesnt have record of repairs for common issues then you might want to budget to repair or replace those parts within the first year of ownership.

3973620,0,t1_cr8xoae,I only drove those two but I researched the Golf GTI Fiesta ST Mustang V and WRX. I also thought about the MazdaSpeed  but it was due for a refresh soon so I felt like I should either wait or skip it. I hear a lot of bad things about the Genesis Coupe having poor suspension so I didnt even think about that one. They also have the Veloster which I hear is OK I think its a little bit cheaper than the Fiesta ST but the look is just not for me.The Mustang and FRS were on my radar because I wasnt sure if I wanted a hot hatch or a two door sports car. I skipped the mustang because of the front end clearance it wasnt enough for some of the areas I drive in regularly. I think the current mustang is a great bang for your buck if you get a base model v. They look sharp handle well with the new IRS and get great MPGs. The FRS GTI and WRX were tippy top of my spending budget. I used the FocusFiesta ST as my baseline and simply asked myself What does the FRSGTIWRX do better and is it really worth the extra money?The GTI is very well built but it didnt have anything that seemed to make it that much better than the Focus ST.The FRS was a completely different car and I loved the aftermarket support for it but I wanted something that even stock was fun and it just wasnt fun for me. It was also a bit on the low side and I didnt want to have to worry about messing up my bumper all of the time.The WRX is a great car but the price was just too high for me in the end. On top of that Im kind of sad they dont have a wagon. If you see this Subaru BRING BACK THE WRX WAGON OR STOP MAKING CARS.The Fiesta ST fell off my radar because of its size it just felt tiny to me and I didnt like it. I came from a  Focus SE so I was used to the mk Focus body geometry and the ST takes a great budget car and turned it into a great hot hatch. You can drive it hard and make it fun or you can drive it soft and act like its just a Focus. Insurance is cheap I can haul people and stuff without much of an issue and it cost barely more than a regular top trim focus hatch.,cars,cr98588,2,t5_2qhl2

Almost always CGI or a preprod model where theres extra attention paid to fitment that never translates to production cars. Production carsfrom budget econo boxes to six figure exoticstend to have some form of disconnect in terms of reflections transitioning from one panel to the next.Almost every LFA Ive seen especially in black has me drooling over how perfect theyre fitted. The horizon reflection on its profile from fenderdoorfender is one perfect line. You dont find that on much of any kind of car. It just looks more expensive because of this. Edit found the article that references these extreme measures.The last step inside the facility postassembly inspections an elaborate affair conducted in a closed off room with a lighting arrangement designed specifically for the LFA.

It really depends on the model of car age reputation of that car and most importantly for cars of this age is how well the car has been taken care of. I have bought cars at k k and k all bmws. The newest of these cars was  years old when i bought it. and each has  had at least  owners. Prices have ranged from . Each one of the purchases have worked out really well for me. I flew out to boston and drove  hours home for one car. First i researched the models reliability and common faults. I avoided problematic models and engines. I looked for ads with good pictures and when i talked to the owner i looked for them to not be a complete moron. Its difficult to expect an idiot to take care of a car and secondly it can be hard to make a deal with them. Things like seat wear pedal wear and tire wear can tell you a fair amount about how the car is driven. A good overall inspection covers the rest. Some cars to consider.

4133059,0,t3_3804ua,Well personally I prefer to keep the car between  rpm. I downshift and use the engine brake brakes to slow it down and I downshift when the car is around  rpm. But I dont care about mileage. Keeping the rev in that range gives me enough power to accelerate quickly in case of emergencies. I never put the car to neutral unless I am at complete stop. And I advise to do so. Keeping the car in neutral while in motion is not a wise idea.,cars,crre410,1,t5_2qhl2

4138597,0,t3_381oux,Having a vehicle decision making crisis here...Were replacing my  Camry with a  Mazda for my wife to haul the kids around in. This means I get to drive her  Mazda. We probably wont have the money to do another car swap for another  months. I cant decide what to replace the Mazda with when the time comes. I dont really want to keep it because it feels small for my  frame and when Ive driven it before it felt weezy and underpowered.Im  have a couple kids both of which need car seats still one rear facing. I need to be able to haul them all if needed as well so doors are out.Budget will be around  used preferring under  miles or soMy car historyMy first car was an  Toyota Celica GT loved that car rear wheel drive hatchback coolness lightweight awesomeness.My second car was an  Toyota Cressida loved that car too comfortable nice ride old school inline i rear wheel drive fun...My third car the one that needs more work that I want to put into it now was an  Toyota Camry XLE v. Lots of room but not as much as more modern sedans the back seat is cramped lots of pickup and go with that v ok styling was reliable until now  miles needs timing belt electrical work sensors brakes body repair exhaust repair....Also i commute  miles round trip every day. And this is pretty much the biggest issue because what I really want is a truck. Something like a Tacoma quad cab. But the trucks are expensive for what youre getting and get poor mileage.What are some good daily commuterweekend warriorfamily haulers... These three dont seem to converge at all seems like I have to pick only  or two of those three options.Any carswagons you all like that hold the kids but can also hold stuff from the hardware store? Like with the Camry the seats only fold all the way down if I remove the bottom seat completely... not ideal and theres only a ft by ft hole in the trunk that goes into the cabin to make use of those folded seats.

4158451,0,t1_crtyhoi,Edit my comment was meant for uglrage Miata gearing is always the answer. All Miatas have short low gears ND is no exception. It accelerates pretty quickly for a hp lbs car  so I assume at WOT you will be rowing as a mad boatman. I will know as soon as my Mazda dealership has some on the lot.Basically to maintain access to power the ND engine will need to stay far away from the optimal mileage area of the rev range. Low gears mean the engine revs up there very quickly and you spend MUCH more time over k rpm whereas a middleaged person driving an FType may never even see k rpm on the tach. The FType will cruise in the th gear doing mph and well over mpg at k rpm. My former NC would buzz in the th at .k to do the same kind of highway speed.,cars,cru9w50,6,t5_2qhl2

I have almost no real world experience with good cars besides the  or so cars Ive test driven. And every time I test drive a car for anything less than an hour or  I find it hard to actually figure out how it drives in that short of a time period. Idk. Maybe I just dont know how to test drive a car. I usually just hoon it as much as I can.For example the  speed auto. I had one in my PT Cruiser. I didnt hate it and I didnt love it. I have test driven the  speed in the  and charger Hemis pretty extensively probably  hours in total. And I didnt notice anything that made me say wow I hate this!. The acceleration is still in the low  second range for the Chrysler  which I think is great. I also test drove the  speed auto in the Charger. Maybe it comes from lack of experience but I cant tell you I noticed a big difference. But then I read car reviews and they wax poetic about how much better it is.

4205909,0,t3_391wyo,Its the catalytic converter heat shield. ObserveIts on the underside of the exhaust and its there to do a couple of things. One keep you from starting a fire should you park your car in dry grass on the side of the road for example. Shouldnt be an issue if you are mindful of not parking off in the weeds.Second it also provides some protection for the cat against impact from gravel heat shields that fell off OTHER Jetttas and assorted road hazards. The brick inside the cat is a ceramic honeycomb and it can be broken up by a hard enough impact. This is a Bad Thing because broken pieces of that brick can obstruct the exhaust leading to all sorts of bad stuff.Of course none of this says WHY the heat shield fell off. That I cant say. For peace of mind have somebody put it up in the air to inspect the cat for damage. If its OK then theres no need to do anything about it really.TLDR  If the catalytic converter is OK dont run things over or park on top of flammable things and all will be well.,cars,crznvbs,3,t5_2qhl2

Unfortunately Ive never heard of a car going through a major electrical system replacementrepair and being the same.  If you do any work on it yourself or have a local shop that does not a dealer Id have them go over it searching for a bad ground.  The craziest gremlims Ive ever chased were bad grounds.I still remember talking to a colleague of mine that worked on the mustang team when it was still in Dearborn Assembly pre and he said the customer satisfaction always came down to wanting paint shinier stereo louder and car faster.I certainly agree that the US domestic car manufacturers got lazy about designing and building products.  It is certainly getting better but I think it is far more bottom line both sales and costs of repair driven rather than any particular legal requirement.

4244394,0,t1_cs3o11h,I really like the looks of the new targa but IMO the folding mechanism is too complicated. Took some engineering skills to pull that off but that doesnt make it a good thing in fact I would be impressed if they could do it with less moving parts. My miata for example can have its top lowered while still in the car albeit manually and it doesnt need to fold through the rear window which allows it to be glass unlike my gfs moms z which has to have a plastic window for that very reason. I realize that convertibles and targas are not the same but just using that comparison to show that simple is better. I would happily get out of the car and manually remove the targa top like the older versions plus it would save weight losing all those eletric motors and extra metal used to move the top.Edit just remembered the  targas glass roof just slid back like a sunroof.

You can technically improve the top end response by swapping a turbo to a bigger one that has more lag down low but spools up at higher RPM and produces more punch at higher RPM but honestly unless you are serious about racing the car its not worth it in price. At a certain point you are going to arrive at a used Mustang GT price with  hp stock and then just spend an extra k on a supercharger and you will be able to keep up with Ms. ,cars,cs4o3kg,3,t5_2qhl2

I do know dealership maintenance will cost more than a z but by much I dont know I havent been inclined to flush the transmission fluid or anything yet.Id also greatly recommend the GxS if you can find it youll wish you had the Akebonos  pot calipers its worth the markup.For the Gx Id also greatly recommend Hotchkiss sway bars the stock sway bars in the Gx are so small especially in the rear its a night and day difference in ride quality going from the stock twig sway bars to Hotchkiss even if its the only suspension mod.  It feels like a boat stock and it feels planted with the sways.  I think Stillen also makes some sways for AWD application but I love Hotchkiss.Coilovers are another good upgrade Gx is a boat with the stock suspension BC Racing makes some AWD coilovers you might not even want them after installing the sway bars but you can lower the ride height to that of the GS and it feels night and day different.But yeah I have no complaints about the Gx in particular its cheaper than a i and is about as fast handling can be beefed up for less than a few grand the VQVHR seems like a pretty reliable decent engine albeit a bit harsh in the middle and upper end.,cars,csbhew2,3,t5_2qhl2

Insurance is a highly competitive market. Once insurance claims drop due to far fewer collisions the insurance companies will excert a huge competitive pressure on each other to lower premiums. So while insurance will be lower for cars with automatic driving as the mode they are in  of the time and especially for those without any manual driving capabilities cost will also drop for anyone else.,cars,csbvx81,3,t5_2qhl2

4314344,0,t3_3aeucj,Well a more technical specific answer has to do with fuel injectors. On my rx you can see how much fuel they are letting through. In that case  percent is the max the fuel injector can let through. Driving even between mph and mph massively varies. But i would see anywhere from  percent to  percent. This is just to maintain speed. At idle I would see them use . percent. At a high idle I see them use . The high idle is a tuning issueprobably not related to any other car than an rx Haha So you could roughly say if driving at mph maintaining speed is  percent idle would be roughly one th or  percent. That number varies based on RPM and load. ,cars,csbyc12,12,t5_2qhl2

4350201,0,t1_csfv7o1,gt Honda has a tendency to make a nice car that gets outdated fast performancewise. Just like the S which came out with a bang competing against the Z and Boxster but barely received  extra lbft torque in its entire year run while the Bimmer and Porsche evolved into more powerful sports cars.Honda goes allin with their sports cars with exclusive platforms amp engines and no sharing which would help distribute costs. That means they have to keep something going for awhile to get the ROI they need. The S got a midcycle revision but the changes were pretty mild. The NSX was handled similarly too. These were nice and pure sports cars though but it also meant that it was going to be some time before Honda tried anything like them again..On the other hand you have someone like Nissan that cut some corners and used sharing to reduce costs. The Z shared a platform and engines with other vehicles including an SUV. Inside of the time that the S was on sale the Z was launched got two revisions and then was replaced. The replacement was a bit lackluster and now its getting old in the tooth but at least there was a replacement.Two different ways of handling sports cars. Is it better to have a really good one with few updates that might not get a successor? Or do you go with something less capable with a shorter life cycle more updates and a nearguaranteed replacement?,cars,csg008x,12,t5_2qhl2

4401206,0,t3_3bee94,If you want to be a car designer you have your work cut out for you. Its a really competitive industry and getting a studio job is tough. Youre young and you have time to work on your skills. Theres a few schools where you can make that happen but its gonna be like medical school.Look up the Transportation Design programs at Art Center College of Design Center for Creative Studies The Royal College of Art and Pforzheim and start working towards attending one of these schools. That might mean getting a degree in Thailand first but if not it will certainly mean working really hard to put together a competitive portfolio. Your fundamental sketching and rendering skills will be much more important that youre D modeling skills.Your enthusiasm is awesome but youre way underestimating the car industry.Edit check out allthesketches.com or simkom.comsketchsite or just search audi sketches or something like that on pinterest.

4438334,0,t1_csq3h40,The NA peaked at hp while the ND has hp. The NC peaked at hp but its also a minimum of lbs heavier than the ND.The NDs engine also increased in peak torque over the NCs. The weight loss was more important for Mazda to focus on because the NC was heavy and they wanted to improve the feel of the car. Chassis revision and weight reduction is very developmentintensive and costs more than power increases but the price increase for the ND was kept down as well. By reducing weight they improved on more areas than a power increase would have done. Mazda also no doubt realized that the chassis is more important because that isnt something that can easily be improved by customers. If customers want more power then theyre free to use the aftermarket.Edit Additionally despite the NDs greater weight than the NA there are other advancements that will still see it surpass the older car. Chassis design is improved in both safety and stiffness which is part of the reason that the new car can weigh less than the NC despite evertightening safety regulations. The weight loss alone is already something that goes against the grain of the auto industry in general. Most other cars are still getting heaver and while other changes may help them improve despite thatex new Mustang weighs more but IRS makes it better more weight is more weight.,cars,csq4xt4,3,t5_2qhl2

4476064,0,t1_csuv3nd,Post  you will be hard pressed to find a single German car over k miles that has had less than k put into it in work not including regular maintenance tires oil changes etc. especially an M series AMG or RS model. High quality parts isnt the issue complexity is. German engineering has always been about overengineering its why their tanks were the best in the world in WWII. Its also why their tanks failed in WWII because they were in the shop for repairsmaintenance more than they were out in the field.On the high quality parts speaking from my experience with BMW they make high quality motors and suspensions. Everything attached to the motor is pretty cheap. The impeller in like every BMW water pump in existence is plastic. They break and need replacing nearly every k miles. The door locks window motors blower motors and other electronic accessories are cheap parts and they break often.Other issues just off the top of my head BMW alternators are water cooled. Im sure this adds some factor of performance to the part but when it fails its about three times as much labor to change it and the part is twice as expensive. German car cooling systems generally suck and will not make it to over k miles. These cars are crammed to capacity with fancy computer module control systems which break and throw error codes Mercedes is the big culprit with this.Yeah theyre good cars for certain reasons. But they break just as often or even more often than other cars and are roughly twice as expensive to fix for their complexity and the premium that people associate with a luxury vehicle. Your car is an exception not the rule. The N is the epitome of German design and the benchmark for what can go wrong with it.,cars,csuvmdj,34,t5_2qhl2

4550045,0,t3_3dco2p,I own a  miata with k miles. Love it to death. But a month or so ago it started making a nasty grinding noise in the transmission. It would ONLY happen when I had the clutch engaged and ONLY when it wasnt in gear. So whenever I was shifting or it was in neutral with the clutch in. Also when it made the noise I could feel it in the shift knob.Money was tight and it was my DD so I couldnt have it looked at as quickly as I wanted. But a week or two ago... IT STOPPED. Its almost as if it was never there.Now I know car problems rarely go away especially transmissionclutch problems. Any suggestions on where I should look to follow up with this? Should I take it to a tranny expert or just a Mazda shop? Am I fucked in the near future?,cars,ct45nie,2,t5_2qhl2

4553056,0,t3_3ddm3n,The front doors on my grandpas truck dont open from the inside since the handles are broken. I forgot to take this fact into account on a rainy night last December when I was backing the truck into a parking space right next to a really tall really thick hedge. Not wanting to be a dick to the car on the other side I put the truck as close to the hedge as possible... and promptly realized my mistake. I couldnt open the drivers door because the hedge was right there I wouldnt be able to get the door open enough anyway. I couldnt roll the passengers window down and get that door open Id have to get back into the truck and kill the engine and risk the door closing again. Leaving the passenger window down wasnt an option because of the previouslymentioned rain. So after killing the engine I climbed over the front bench seat of the truck ass first...

4558790,0,t3_3dh9l9,Ill tell you hwutI used to not like him actually.  I discovered his channel by accident when I was watching SubaruWRXFans video.  They had a video together where they were driving the Honda Fit together.  In that video I wasnt impressed with Mr. Regular and thought he was trying too hard to be funny.  But then I wanted to see what he REALLY does on his channel.  I decided to watch some of his videos.  I then realized that hes actually quite genius.  Hes definitely a more deep well rounded car reviewer.  He throws in SO MANY references about literature history politics even video games in his video by random.  For Mr. Regular he can make a car review not just about the car itself but everything about it  which makes it unique since most of the other car reviews are only strictly about the cars.  Thats not to say he doesnt know enough about cars quite the opposite actually.  And to top it off hes goofy but it almost feels like those random tourettes like outburst is just a peek into his reality for the viewers  so he just becomes more relatable.

Jeeps have had crumple zones for years now so they tend to be pretty safe in head onrear end collisions. Of course Jeeps are more likely to roll than a car and at highway speeds the roll bar isnt quite as strong as Id like. It will usually do the job but its no competition grade cage. Id imagine the Lambo has way more safety features but because its so low I can also imagine itd be fairly easy for a larger vehicle to run over the hood and directly hit the passenger cabin.

After the brakes failed completely for the third time as in press pedal it goes to floor but does nothing to stop  tons of vehicle the maker generously offered to buy it back. The brakes were only one of the problems though. They had to cut two doors off and reweld the hinges because they were put on wrong. Battery failed when the car was three months old. AC stopped working  they found some metal fastener that had fallen into the blower motor during assembly. One of the belts disintegrated while we were driving. A window came off the track inside the door. Weatherstripping in a couple of the doors was badly offkilter when we compared it to an identical model.I could have understood if there was one or two components that were done wrong by an obviously drunk or pissedoff worker but this was like the entire vehicle mechanical structural electrical braking and powertrain. The dealer tried pretty hard to fix things. The manufacturer had a regional mechanic   i forget his exact title but he was a complete and utter asshole. Possibly the worst human being Ive ever spoken to in my life. In one conference call with the dealer myself and the manufacturer he suggested that I might have messed with the brakes to make them fail and somehow I did this on the middle of a busy freeway with my wife and kids in the car in heavy traffic.Youd think its not possible to hear someone cringe over a phone call but I can say that it is possible.

All i could focus on is the babygreen puke green framing the line green contrast. Fuzzy lens. Get a better one. Start with a cheap fixed mm find a spot you like and wait for it. If you need a zoom i like mm with a low aperture. Flexible and works well for close up zooming or wide landscapes. Fast too.i understand that you probably cant use flashes at events but look up videos and examples of how background lighting affects photos.composition. Rule of thirds.

4780424,0,t3_3gcjj6,So I actually have an interesting story about this.At the University of Michigan campus which is in Ann Arbor the post about Hellcat that was spotted was in one of the downtown parking structure. As you can imagine top university in the country and world quite a few rich asian people attend and live around here the other university Michigan State university is even more so but I digress.So one time I was driving through the engineering campus and lo and behold I saw a Porsche  convertible being driven by two Asian dude no biggie the Asians on this campus have really nice cars R Maserati Ferrari etc rumor has it the owners all know each other and there is a secret club.Back to the story I found it peculiar that they are moving so slowly and kept on stopping and starting not sure if they were trying to test out how fast this car can go from  in the middle of the road or if they were looking at something. Whatever I have things to do and I need to go find parking. Went to run the errand I needed to rungo to class and as I was coming back to the parking lot I saw the Porsche pull in to the now largely vacant parking lot. I figured this is a cool car Im Asian they are Asian we probably hit it off and chat.Turns out dude in the passenger seat is the owner of the Porsche and the driver just came to this country and is learning how to drive. This dude is learning how to drive in a car that could probably pay for  years of my tuition. And he sucked at driving.Anyhow fun story I figured yall would like to hear on this lovely Sunday that may or may not be relevant to this post.Also GO BLUE.,cars,ctx4300,9,t5_2qhl2

4830397,0,t1_cu3dydy,Honda isnt trying to make an S replacement. This car will be halve the price of an S. The S sold horribly as well. A new S would not sell well either. How would a k sports car nearly the price of an S with inflation sell better than a k car? Your are very wrong about Honda putting their RampD into this car. They cant keep them on the lots in Japan. This was obviously a good move in Japan. Will this sell in the US though? At first I was doubtful but I could see it selling well to some crowds. This would be similar in size to a Fiat but a convertible and probably faster than the Fiat . Depending where you live small cars like the Fiat sell pretty well. I wouldnt be surprised if this car attracted more people than just the enthusiast. Probably not though. If they just dont import many here then it wouldnt be a big deal as they sell so well in Japan and I bet this would sell in Europe where small cars are popular too.,cars,cu3etlc,2,t5_2qhl2

Nav is expected to be standard in Europe if its not standard here then I probably wont end up getting the pacakge it comes with. Although I do appreciate a built in Nav system Google Maps is just fine. Im really buying this car because of how I expect it to drive. Ive driven the Mi and the M combine them both and I see the M being nothing but a beast. Im rather young for an M car and Im not buying this car as a statement. I wanted a nice blue however it turns out only  colors will be offeredLong Beach BlueAlpine WhiteMineral GraySapphire Blackand this Long Beach Blue is extremely... out there. I like it but its not for me. I prefer the subdued look of Mineral Gray!The car will come standard with rear sensors but I man select the rear camera as well because I know Im going to be paranoid as hell when Im first learning the dimensions of the car. Its not the CSL just base model. The CSL is still in rumor phase but I expect one to come in a year or . Not for me though. This will be my daily driver. Oh and Im an audio freak so Ill get the Harmon Kardon audio upgrade. Other than that... not set yet. My allocation only has me reserved for an M options are not yet chosen. Since this baby M car will most likely not feature a carbon fiber roof Ill probably get a sun roof. I just freaking love sun roofs...Anyways thanks for the congrats!

5120271,0,t1_cv365or,I LOVE Subaru but there is no doubt that the EJ series engines while really good are just not on par with a lot of the competition these days and do fail more often than the competitors products. The recent generation of standard Impreza and some others had oil use issues because of rings  In addition to the early s well documented issues with head gaskets.I mean like I said I love Subaru I really miss my bugeye WRX and that car never did me wrong but I think if I was in the market for a new turbo everyday car the Ford would be at the top of my list so what Im saying is yeah you might be on to somethingThough to be clear you dont need AWD in snow at all. A much bigger factor in snow is the tires. If you have good winter tires on a car you can drive pretty much anything better than something on all seasons. A newer civic will do excellent  in the snow on something like a set of falkein eurowinters or blizzaks if you want to go full snow and ice.

5129931,0,t1_cv4c9wu,For American cars yes. They do tend to be much quicker for the dollar at the expense of interior quality and other things. A good example of this is the Corvette Z which offers similar performance figures as a Ferrari  at  the cost but there is far less leather and comfort. The interiors have vastly improved they are still not Volkswagen or Audi quality though. For instance I occasionally drive a  Acadia which is the last year of the first generation for that car. The whole car feels like dirt cheap plastic and creaks. But in the  and up models it is much nicer and feels more premium.One big improvement they have made is soft touch plastics before it was old hard plastics that felt like a Chevy Cavalier but now GM has made the move to soft touch plastics and leather accents across the dashboard. Same with Ford except for the  F which doesnt have the greatest interior quality but it gets an excuse because work Truck,cars,cv4ckjy,2,t5_2qhl2

While traction is an issue I will be going to  Rcomps as soon as these tires are shot an LSD goes a long way towards remedying it. Dont get too hard into the throttle in first youll just roast the rears and dont get too hard on the throttle mid corner unless you are deliberately trying to induce oversteer which you really shouldnt do on the street. Be delicate in wet conditions and give yourself time to adjust to the way this car behaves. Also buy good tires I recommend the Pilot Super Sports unless you can afford to replace a set of Rcomps every k miles or so if you go Rcomps DO NOT drive on them below freezing they turn into ice cubes and you will have no traction even at half the power that the chaser is making.,cars,cv4mt6l,1,t5_2qhl2

5145694,0,t3_3ldsry,Im going to put forward the new Miata.The vast majority of cars are striving to constantly move update refresh and keep up with the times. Few design teams have ever styled or engineered a car and said well we got that right and never touch it again. Fashions change preferences change and new technology comes about. Metrics must be constantly improving more power more gears more infotainment screens more leather etc. This is the way of a great many cars. Honda Civics are terrific vehicles but there is a  chance that each iteration will eventually be outdated its designed to be redesigned. In terms of model life cycle theyre like subscription based vehicles.There are a select few models throughout history that have achieved the unthinkable equilibrium. The designs just worked and each example was timeless from new. Minimal technological upgrades are applied throughout the life of the cycle but the amount of reinvention is a pittance compared to almost all other models. The Porsche  for a long time and the Volkswagen Beetle are the two most iconic examples and its not a coincidence that they were both designed in the middle of the th century. There are a few cars that come very close models running for a ridiculously long time with minimal upgrades Jeep Cherokee is a personal favorite. But in a world that demands constant improvement it is a rare achievement. As time goes on technology moves faster and the average auto consumer is more demanding. Its almost unthinkable to do what the original  did in todays market. One of the models that is close is the Jeep Wrangler the absolute bare minimal changes are applied in each generation because the format just works.Thats why I have such a massive amount of respect for the new Miata and the downgrade in power it received. When was the last time a model  particularly a performance oriented model  lost power on a redesign? It hasnt happened often since emissions were dominating performance. For Mazda to take a step back respect the format that the Miata has mastered and resist the temptation to get in the technological rat race is exceedingly rare today. I have an immense amount of respect for that car and brand just for having the guts to build a static car.,cars,cv68z7e,5,t5_2qhl2

The daily just has more chances of encountering salt and moisture. Most manufacturers end their rust warranty around  years so expect it to appear then.Without combustion your valves shouldnt build up carbon so a low mileage engine will probably have retained HP compared to its daily driven cousin.Tires will fail by time or wear.Rotors and pads shouldnt be hurt by time.

Also most dealerships arent worried about their reputation if they were you wouldnt hear so many horror stories.Unless this is an extended warranty offered by the manufacturer impossible at this point it probably will have some restrictions so make sure you read the fineprint and understand the whole process.Hopefully you didnt pay a fortune for it because most dealers take advantage of customers who havent done their research.  Ive never heard of a good affordable warranty plan which truly covers wear amp tear.I hope you at least googled the VIN  or even better requested a Car Fax report although even those are far from perfect.Last but not least try to understand the warranty terms the dealer includes on every used vehicle and figure out major issues before this point in time even with the extended warranty.Good luck with the vehicle its not a bad choice as long as its in good shape.,cars,cvbgnfo,1,t5_2qhl2

5199208,0,t1_cvcnj29,Well see... Prepping for the swap I looked into just building this one. You can only run about  lbs of boost on the stock ECU with a GE before it starts freaking out. Thats good for AROUND  optimistically. Definitely not double the  they start with but still a fun car. I think the SC got the same W or W manuals that the IS had unless youre putting in something different like an R. The Ws can only hold like hp before people start breaking all kinds of stuff. I have heard of people running more but they are either  footed rabbits or baby footed drivers. The GTE is stronger all around and comes with the stuff you would need to increase power. They can get to  on stock everything including turbos according to most accounts and run like that forever. Of course the sky is the moon after that with them. And they come with the ECU and other stuff you need to run boost which is a big lacking feature of the stock GE ECU when trying to make more power. Just throwing it out there if youre going that route its not hard to jump up to GTE instead. Im sure youve done your research on your own car more than I have though!

5225760,0,t3_3mj9e1,I work for a dealership and something  I look for is o  the line items with dates if the car was towed away or listed as immobile. Also I look at how long the vehicle was owned by that owner after the wreck. Im usually fairly comfortable if I see a longer ownership after the accident and that it was not immobiletowed away. Frame damage can take up to  months to show up on a history report with a branded title after it was sold through an auction as well. So make sure the wreck was longer ago then that. If its a private sale or really shady dealer that got it on a trade and not an auction they might not ever disclose frame damage to keep a clean title as well. That will only show up when disclosed through an auction which is legally required. ,cars,cvfw8o4,3,t5_2qhl2

They didnt seem to have a direction.They turned the Eclipse from a tuner car into a sportylooking economy car. They dropped the GT completely. It seemed like they just wanted to build fuel efficient vehicles but they just couldnt keep up with Honda and Toyota.Now Mitsubishi is leaving the United States. Thats how crappy their brand has become. They cant sustain marketability here.Subaru who I have always seen as Mitsus main rival only because of Impreza vs Lancer have done what Mitsu shouldve.

5245863,0,t1_cvi9tva,Ive only had the car for ten days so I cant give you the best assessment yet. The clutch is a lot heavier than my Honda Fit was still getting used to that and I find the turn signal stalk feels kind of cheap. The navigation system pauses your music or mutes the radio to say things which annoys me to no end making me turn off turnbyturn when using it. Bluetooth audio support is kind of meh. The Recaro seats are tight but I manage okay despite being very tall and very fat The ST trim equivalent is the only Focus ST available on the Canadian market. For me I naturally rest my arm on the windowsil and this causes shoulder pain after a little while Im still training myself out of this behaviour. The centre console is pathetically small and there are not many storage spots for random crap up front glovebox small centre console and two cupholders plus a little tiny thing about the size of two packs of gum under the radio. Oh and the antenna is kind of ugly. The good is everything else christ I love this car  The gas tank is  L . Gallons  In Canada they suggest  octane for max power though itll run on  with less power. I think in the US they recommend  its just rarer on the Canadian market so I could fill the tank on  for less than  and  for probably under  I need to shop around a bit more for that I filled with  on first fillup for .L ,cars,cvibda1,2,t5_2qhl2

Modern cars have unibody constructions with crumple zones to absorb the impact.  If you look in your front picture... it actually appears that the frame rail miraculously didnt impact the tree but everything else around it absorbed the impact. The S was notoriously bad in crash test performance.   The same goes for its Blazer BodyOnFrame SUV counterpart.That said... crashes are unpredictable.  You got lucky.  A car with a stellar rating could have been in a crash at similar speeds into a tree and a slight difference in angle impact point etc. could be the difference between walking away with superficial injuries and a decorative brass urn.Stay safe out there!,cars,cvllp1q,7,t5_2qhl2

5290192,0,t1_cvnuaed,Its afterfire. As the throttle is released the fuel mixture is momentarily very rich and unburned fuel combusts in the exhaust making a popping noise. The large free flowing exhausts and rich AF mixture common in performance cars often makes afterfire much more prominent than in other cars.Afterfire is often incorrectly called backfire. Backfire is the combustion of fuel in the intake manifold and is very harmful to nearby components sensors turbo the intake manifold itself etc. Afterfire occurs in most vehicles to some extent and is generally harmless.,cars,cvnvu8z,30,t5_2qhl2

5291916,0,t3_3ng7oj,So I probably live in one of the worser states for snowroad salting. Especially considering how much coastline we have. In any event I drive a single car and it has  major rust. I do have some surface rust but its nothing to complain about considering my car is from . The most fun I have ever had year round is in a  truck. Not because its fast or great off road or anything. Its because you literally have  worries driving it. Hit a curb going to fast around a corner and shattered the tie rod end? No problem thats  bucks to fix. Due that in my girlfriends car and your probably replacing everything on that side of the axle. Do it in my car and you will be waiting for parts for a year. In the winter time it slides around like a dream. Once again if you cant handle it and hit a curb who cares. Its just going to laugh it off. Not to mention the utility.As far as owning it as a single vehicle.... If you have a family its obviously a no go. To own a single car in the north east is very rough. My girlfriend and step dad both struggle with hills that my car will happily chug along and up. Where as in the summer time there cars are both way more enjoyable. Then again if I owned a late searly s AWD car im sure mine would be enjoyable too. More or less if you want a corner carver style of car you need two cars. They simply handle snow terribly. Granted that your miata is RWD its going to fishtail... A lot. I drove a  chevy k for a year. In the snow time... Im staying under mph if theres snow in the ground. Even with  pounds in the back with  right over each rear wheel it still wanted to let spin. Keep in mind this is an underpowered v with brand new off road style tires. Im willing to be the miata would handle it better but how much better is debatable. Your also going to need snow tires without a doubt. Also due to how low the miata weighs it may just float on top of the snow and have a hard time packing it down to hit concrete which will cause massive understeering.Personally I would sell both your cars buy the new miata then spend k dollars on a  jeep grand cherokee. They are dirt cheap and the engines run for k miles no problem. My dads didnt go until k and that was while being abused with off roading every weekend. Especially since your just going to drive it in the winter... You could also drive the miata in the winter when snow was not on the ground though.,cars,cvo3r7b,1,t5_2qhl2

She dreamed of owning a Porsche since she rode in a family friends  as little girl. My wife and I could never could afford a second car let alone a Porsche. Anyways last Christmas we were finally financially stable enough for me to buy one. Bought it looking like the first picture above. I had everything finished by Christmas expect paint. Couldnt commit to a color without her opinion. So I surprised her with a Porsche that looked really rough on Christmas morning. Our family is obsessed with orange and she decided to paint it GT RS orange. Took  coats of paint to get it just right. Needs a new paint job but thats a whole other story. Has  mirrors Fiberwerks front bumper custom sound system racing seats whole new exhaust system leather wrapped dash new carpet throughout. Will be doing an LS swap this winter most likely.Sorry for the long post and picture overload as you can tell I am REALLY into Porsches.,cars,cvofiny,11,t5_2qhl2

5344448,0,t1_cvui9f0,I dont buy this reasoning. Tires are an integral part of a vehicle especially on supercars like this which work with tire manufacturers to custom tailor things like compound and tread pattern. If one car comes standard with better tires then its manufacturer has simply done a better job of maximizing its performance capabilities no different to having better brake pads or suspension settings. Besides even if all three were modified to ride on the same exact type of tire would you also not need to factor in to consideration that each one has different width wheels that can only fit certain sizes of tire? Even on identical compounds the mm rear tires of the LaFerrari might find more traction than the mm ones on a P. You could try running them on exactly the same size wheels too but then you run the risk of completely ruining suspension alignment unless that is also modified accordingly. There would be no end to it. I think the cars should be driven on whatever tires they can be specced with from the factory to customers because this is supposed to be a test of the best each manufacturer has to offer without any additional modifications.,cars,cvuta2c,1,t5_2qhl2

The few midsize trucks that we do have on the market end up getting the same mileage as the larger trucks while being able to tow and carry less weight. So if in the end youre not saving on price or fuel economy then why bother?gtEspecially when the Fss on the market are getting so pricey If you dont want a  fram then dont order one equipped that way  will get you a decently equipped extended cab short bed x half ton which will be more useful and more comfortable than a  quad cab long bed Canyon or Tacoma and itll be the same length overall only about  inches wider.,cars,cw5o54z,11,t5_2qhl2

5469045,0,t1_cwaasmm,Ok Im at an actual computer now im just gonna rant at you about Fd ownership.Firstly Its not as hard as everyone makes it out to be although im only  miles into my rebuild. So you have a few choices when looking for a car. You can get one thats been freshly rebuilt and hope it was done right buy one thats in need of a rebuild or get one that has very low miles. I personally think that the savings and peace of mind you have in getting one that needs a rebuild is the way to go. Lowest miles you can find typical longevity of a motor is k miles before it needs a rebuild.Immediate mods you should doAs soon as you get the car redo the vacuum hoses. Its cheap and there are awesome color coded diagrams online its not as bad as people think.Also These cars have a fuel pressure damper that fails and catches you engine bay on fire so obviously address it immediately by either deleting it installing an aftermarket fuel pressure regulator  or going stainless an lines.Invest in a good radiator and check out the fc thermoswitch mod.Thats all for now.,cars,cwaq0dr,6,t5_2qhl2

5470704,0,t1_cwardtn,It is! I like a few of Peugeots cars they have good design principle. As far as that car I absolutely love it. But I know why it failed  bhp. Its slow unfortunately. A car that should be fast is slow. And could they have made it faster? Absolutely  but going anywhere decent up from  brings it into competition with the Civic Si which Honda will never do. So there it sits as it is. And it makes me sad. For one I know that you can easily fit a supercharger onto that car from Jackson Racing. And it actually increases the fuel mileage as well as the bhp. That would make for an amazing car! Its exactly what Id do to one if I had it. And for the record they actually did come in traditional manual youre correct. The hybrid portion is an integrated electric motor that works behind the transmission so that allows for a six speed manual transmission to run the car and an additional electric motor assist in additional HP and MPGs. I recently got to drive one it was a blast. Was it slow? Eh yeah but not really that bad. Its still a sports car. But the best part was the handling! It felt so tight and taut! I wanted to take it around a track to find its grip limits because it held so well! If you go to a Honda dealer they may let you test drive one. If you lived anywhere near me Id let you test one where I work haha. ,cars,cwaxmqz,2,t5_2qhl2

As for you questioning your instructor while parking his point of view is different from yours and yours as the driver is the only one that counts. Unless both of you are the exact same height and seats are positioned identically what you see is not what he sees. Heres how it really goes as far as the learning curve goes. Youll go through the motions of learning stick then one day itll REALLY click in and it becomes muscle memory.. Youll go through the motions of learning to gauge distance the anxiety will go down but never away because it is a defensive instinct. . Youll go through the motions of learning how to park properly. For some people it clicks to the point that it becomes a near instinct for others it means a little work and some will spend their lives struggling with it. I was never comfortable parking in reverse until I got my first car with a backup camera because I know exactly where the car is going and it gives me proximity alerts for obstacles. . Worrying about pedestrians never goes away because people both drivers and pedestrians are stupid. All that you can do about it is to be alert and to be careful around areas that are populated heavily and is hard to see the sidewalks clearly. It doesnt hurt to practice a little bit on your own. Like uKasmein suggests a marked stationary safety zone. ,cars,cwb3kae,1,t5_2qhl2

L engine that is in the car.  Time money and family all have made the learning process that much slower as well.

5533929,0,t1_cwiyyzu,I disagree. Skoda offer a Value Propostion. Its all about branding and marketing but Skoda offer a VW like vehicle I.e. huge parts and platform commonality but forgo luxuries like a large range of options. Model lines tend to be simpler with a couple of engine options and  trim levels. This means a cheaper but less customisable car.It seems to me that with the success of Hyundai and other white goods brands in the states there is a place for Skoda certainly and possibly Seat. It just takes the right vehicles at the right price point and I dont know if the costings stack up in the US.Id say the VW Diesel Scandal has significantly hurt the chances of it happening. Skoda sell a lot of Diesels and Seats are almost exclusively Diesel in line with the economical and moneywise image of the brands. Skoda use VW engines and are tied up in the problem so Id imagine theyll be laying low and trying to recoup losses and brand confidence for a while.

5545398,0,t3_3r1h2q,From the time my parents first agreed to let me get a car to the day I first had one in my garage around a month. I had been looking for an RX. I found one at a dealership  hours away but by the time I was able to get up there I checked to see if it was still for sale and it wasnt. Went on Craigslist found an even better RX still over an hour away though test drove it then the guy sold it on me at the last minute. Went on Craigslist AGAIN and found my Nissan ZX. It was right in my area literally walking distance. Went up to test drive the next day then the day after that it was in my garage. Can I ask how much you have saved up? Every cars not gonna be perfect its about finding one that connects with you the most and will last. Hell my Zs in desperate need of a paint job is older than me cars  smells like a lawnmower but shes infinitely better and more reliable than an RX. I can rely on her to start up every time and shell last for as many miles as I decide to keep her for. Dont look for a car that is absolutely perfect youll never find one.

5554651,0,t3_3r54wp,Dont decelerate hard and dont accelerate hard. Also a steady throttle is also very important.Once I was driving uphill in really bad conditions FWD no TC and every time I started to spin I released the throttle. This caused me to loose all my speed and had to crawl up in first gear at about kmph. I recommend keeping a steady foot some wheelspin wont hurt and you can maintain your speed a lot better.Now Im guessing the Mazda is the car youre driving this winter and I guess it has TC so the throttle control isnt to important as the car will fix that for you. Just be wary of the breaks.I drive a fairly old car  Avensis and the ABS isnt the best so when I break Im not letting the ABS to any work other than notify me of where the threshold is and keep the breaking pressure right there so I can barely feel the ABS working. IME this is the best way to remain the ability to turn as well as slowing down as fast as possible. However Im not sure how this is on newer cars.If you drive a manual learn rev matching as this has saved me many times when Ive down shifted whilst going downhill in turns. The clutch is also your friend. If you loose traction on your running wheels press the clutch pedal and let it regain traction then rev match before you release it to remain traction.Also make sure you have a good set of winter tires. Studded vs. non studded is also a decision to make. Studded works a lot better on ice whilst on snow there is barely any difference. Also if there is a lot of slush get winter tires that are optimal for rain. I must mention that the only downside about studded tires are noise terrible traction on wet asphalt and it damages the road and creates dust.A couple things I keep in my trunk in the winter months are tires chains shovel towing rope extra set of socks and a good warm coat.One last thing. Both hands on the wheel until youre comfortable with the conditions then move one hand down to your ebreak.Have fun and good luck!,cars,cwllskq,2,t5_2qhl2

The young man weighed his options. Consulted his finances and had a budget. Then came time for the featuresI want something cool! I want something quick! I want something fun! I want something practical!He started shopping. First he went to the Ford dealer.This one is too rough! He exclaimed.Next he went to the Subaru DealerYou can test drive the car after you buy it. Said the apathetic man at the dealer. Dejected the young man left.Then he heard word of the new GTI had come into his local VW dealer. He went down licketysplit to check it out.Welcome to a land of pure imagination said the salesman gesturing toward the GTI sitting on the lot. Why dont we take it out?The young man was in love. Oh happy day! he proclaimed while ringing it through the gears I have found my bowl of porridge!The young man bought it the next day and drove it home.A month later the car started idling rough. So undeterred by this the young man took it into the dealer and was given a loaner.The car came back two days later with a clean bill of health.Then with k miles on it the car started violently shaking when braking.Oh no! Exclaimed the young man Ill just bring it back inThats when the wicked witch of Germany cast her evil spell upon the young man and his car.Within weeks the car was being brought into the dealer for repairs at least twice a month!The young man started to grow tired of it when to correct an issue they replaced the entire front axle and wiring harness.Then the young man had his parents visiting when most of the lights on the dashboard came on and the car lost power. Patiently they waiting an hour for the tow truck to take them the hour back to the dealer that he had just picked it up from.The car emerged an hour or so later with no explanation from the dealer just a diagnostic test and a software reset listed as maintenance performed on the car.Then the young man had a friend visit. The car had been running perfectly and he had hoped to show it off to his friend.The next morning they head to Myrtle Beach. They tried to start the car but it took more than  seconds to actually crank over! However no lights were on so they went to McDonalds to get breakfast.They made it all the way to the drive through until the car stalled out while paying and was having trouble restarting.The young man dejected called the dealer and was told to bring it in. However with the engine horribly misfiring and most lights on and no boost the car never made it.They placed him in a Jetta TDI Wagon loaner and they went to the beach.The young man called VW of America to see if they could help in his misfortunes. However VWOA wasnt in a very good mood and told him to sue them or shut up.Two days later they called him up and told him that the car was fixed. He went to retrieve it. Then it had a squeaking noise.The dealer said that the squeaking noise was caused by a faulty seat frame rail and it would be a month to get one in.The young man told them to shove it until they got the seat frame rail because he didnt want to chance an accident. weeks later the frame rail arrived and the young man picked up his car.The young man didnt even make it home before the car started to have boost issues again. Three days later the young man traded it for an SHO and has only looked back in pity on the car that was screwed from the factory.Do you know what the lesson is? Buy ANYTHING other than a VW.,cars,cwvob7m,73,t5_2qhl2

5637651,0,t3_3sc4i5,gtHow are the roadside surveys performed?gtVehicles selected for testing are stopped by an officer of the California Highway Patrol. The consumer is greeted by a BAR representative who provides them with information about the surveys purpose and answers any question they may have. The survey is performed in a manner similar to a Smog Check inspection and usually takes less than  minutes.gtHow do these surveys affect consumers?gtParticipation in the survey is voluntary. There are no consequences to consumers regardless of their vehicles emission control equipment or its emission levels. At the conclusion of the inspection the participants receive a Vehicle Inspection Report VIR detailing the results of the test.gtDoes the survey take the place of a required Smog Check inspection?gtNo. The VIR may not be substituted for a vehicles official Smog Check inspection report. However the VIR does provide important information about the vehicle. BAR staff will also alert participants to any mechanical issues that are observed while conducting the inspection.Well to be honest if the above information is true AND they make it very clear in the first few words that this is voluntary and the person is free to go if they wish I dont see the problem.  voluntary and  you dont get cited  fined  smog revoked if you suddenly dont pass.Of course I am a little skeptical.,cars,cwvwkg5,3,t5_2qhl2

5645918,0,t3_3sf7jz,I drive an  i and my dad has an  LS that I drive regularly. The Series is an excellent car but the cost to maintain it versus the Lexus has been laughable. The BMW has incurred a few thousand dollars of maintenance costs this year whereas the Lexus has only needed an oil change since its  mile service just hit k. Both have their strengths and weaknesses though. The BMW is just satisfying to drive whereas the Lexus is more relaxing to drive. The BMW does well on long roadtrips but its amazing how you can step out of the Lexus after having covered hundreds of miles feeling refreshed and at ease. One aspect where the BMW definitely shines over the Lexus to me is that I continuously want to drive it  after driving the Lexus somewhere I feel fine to not drive it again for a while but with the BMW the itch to drive it is almost always there. That said my dad leased a GS years ago and still laments letting it go. I think for your purposes a GS would combine most of the best attributes of the i and the LS. ,cars,cwwxihm,1,t5_2qhl2

There is a reason why you can get them for under k with low miles. No one wants to deal with the crazy upkeep. Luckily he flips higher end cars and just drives the ones he sells so he has put less than k miles on it. EDIT oh and they want  to replace a one of the side bulbs in in the headlight assembly.

5763078,0,t1_cxbesld,gtgap  On a spark plug you have two components that facilitate the spark  the center wire and the ground wire.  The center wire is as the name implies in the center of the plug. The ground wire is the arm that curves over the top of the center wire. The space between these two points is called the gap of the spark plug.   Some engines require a large gap some require a small gap. Typically your owners manual or a google search of a forum related to your vehicle will give you the proper gap.  Measuring the gap is done with feeler gauges  thin pieces of metal that are of a very precise thickness. Line up feeler gauges that total to your desired gap try to slip them between the center wire and the ground wire. Adjust the ground wire as necessary.  gtMAF  The MAF is your Mass Air Flow sensor It tells the computer what volume of air is being sucked into the engine so that the computer can properly determine the amount of fuel to inject.  Basically its a little dangly thing inside a precisely sized tube.  Get a can of MAF sensor cleaner remove the MAF from the air intake it resides somewhere between the air filter and the throttle body and spray it down with the cleaner. Dont touch the dangly thing just spray it. Let it air dry and then reinstall the sensor.,cars,cxbgoun,1,t5_2qhl2

So I roll up on a minivan camped out in the lefthand lane doing a nice mph.  lanes and the other two are empty so I get over about a half mile before I catch up. No biggie. Dually accelerates. He gets up on them with his brush lights and HID headlights on and brings it down to  about  feet from their bumper. Minivan doesnt move. Dually flicks his highs at them. Minivan doesnt move. I move over another lane in case either shithead starts swerving and dually flicks his lights twice more and then says fuckit and leaves them on. Minivan doesnt move. Dually deploys the best weapon yet  the train horn. He must have had one of those kits because he hits them with two short bursts and then lays on it for  seconds. Minivan visible shakes in the lane as the driver is startled and then quickly slides into the middle lane. At this point I think this is hilarious but then dually pulls a douche move and gets over and brake checks the minivan hard.

So I highly doubt theyd consider hellcat  when they got rid of the srt . The latest  is a refresh but not a redo. The actual platform of the car is at least  years old with really no major improvements. The  is kinda stale. Chrysler  is coming like next year? Which Im sure is going to be a terrible car like a chevy aveo level of bad. Year after that the new chrysler crossover hybrid thing and a refresh for the .  is the redo for the . New generation will almost certainly have a new platform. Incidentally  is also the next generation for the charger and challenger. These generations are what run into s mpg limits so you can pretty much bet the hellcat engine wont even make it in the challenger. Were talking l turbo and v turbo as probably the only options here.

5826707,0,t3_3uy5h6,I was driving home from a business trip in my Miata when the long bolt holding the alternator to the side of the block decided it was time to duck out which cause the other bolt to snap off inside the alternator housing and wedge the alternator against the side of the block. The alternator pulley then seized and ripped quite a bit off of the V belt that spun the alternator off the crank pulley. Took the alternator off and walked about  miles back to an exit where there was a small gas station and called the nearest parts store about  minutes away and asked if they could send out an alternator. They didnt have one in that store but had one at a store about an hour and a half away so the drivers of both stores started heading in the direction of one another and met halfway. The alternator finally got to me and now I just had to solve the issue of the bolts. The gas station had some trucker supplies which included a few SAE bolts. I grabbed a long stud some hose clamps and some bolts that would thread into the top hole a little bit they didnt have anything with the right thread pitch. Got back to the car put the stud in the bottom and a hose clamp on either side to hold it from moving back and forth and threaded the top bolt in as much as possible without stripping any threads and used the belt that was pretty much destroyed and tightened it all up. The bolt that was the wrong thread pitch came out a couple times but I bought a pack of  and could deal with that. About  minutes from home however the t radiator cap decided it hated me and cracked open spewing coolant all over the accessory belts which in turn both threw themselves off and I lost my alternator and power steering. I ended up calling for a ride the rest of the way home and going back the next day with a buddy and replaced the top bolt coolant and belts and drove it the rest of the way home. ,cars,cxjenlb,2,t5_2qhl2

5873179,0,t3_3vovkm,That looks like a pretty standard list for the type of hit you had. Radiator assy auto trans is the radiator assembly. There are different versions on many vehicles depending on whether they have an automatic or manual transmission.AM CAPA hood is an aftermarket hood certified by CAPA. Its new but its not made by Honda. Pretty standard for an yearold car. AM CAPA fender is the same thing except obviously its the fender and not the hood.The side mount is the motor mount that holds the engine up off the right frame rail. If it had to be moved to to the repair to the inner bits and it was already wearing then theyd just replace it. It might also have been torn. The middle bit is rubber. The air conditioning condenser is basically the radiator for the air conditioner. It looks just like the radiator and sits right in front of it on most cars.A mangled apron is adjsutertalk for having damaged the inner part of the fender. THIS is a picture of a Honda Civic. The front half of the right apron is the part outlined in black on the left side of the picture. If the metal is a bit wadded at the tip you can straighten it. If its really messed up then you can replace it. On many vehicles the manufacturer sells the front half of it as an option to the whole thing. Im not sure what front bulkhead is. The particular estimating system pay refer to the radiator support or the frame railapron assembly as a bulkhead.If the car is worth kk then most insurers wont total it until the damages hit like kk so its not really close to being totaled at this point.Not sure what sort of bar would be straightened. If its a suspension part it would be replaced. If its the bumper bar then its normally replaced. You used to be able to fix them but most vehicles now use high strength steel or ultra high strength steel for that and rebending it weakens it. Some manufacturers allow for repairing the tips at either end but not the part between the frame rail ends in the middle.If you go down to the body shop and ask to see your car they should be able to show it to you and explain whats being repaired or replaced. If you go later in the day its more likely that theyll take you out in the shop since the techs are probably gone or wrappingup and theyre probably not doing anything hazardous like pulling frames or anything like that. I actually used to enjoy owners that did that since plenty of people basically said eh call me when its done.  ,cars,cxpi7in,5,t5_2qhl2

5924837,0,t3_3wazpo,You dont have to change the oil every  miles even with regular oil unless a lot of engine operation happens during traffic jams.   miles is usually fine.  High mileage oil has an additive to make the rubber seals swell up a bit to stop leaks and Mobil indicates it also contains an additive to reduce oil consumption and also more detergent than normal to prevent sludge buildup.  OTOH in the late s when Consumer Reports tested oils in NYC taxicabs and changed every  miles they didnt have sludge problems.  I believe all the oils were regular except for Mobil  synthetic.  Mobil recommends its Mobil  synthetic be left in the crankcase for the longest change interval allowed by the vehicle maker.  Dont buy Amsoil.  According to one oil additive expert they dont seem to do the kind of research that the major lubricant makers perform but just bottle oil and additives bought from suppliers.  He criticized them for not having engines for comprehensive testing.  You can get other synthetic oil  thats at least as good as Amsoil but costs less sometimes as little as    a quart with rebates Pennzoil has one going now.  That oil additive expert recommended using the cheapest oil of the vehicle makers recommended viscosity range and with the highest American Petroleum Institute API quality rating currently SN for gasoline engines but said synthetic might be better for turbocharged engines trailer towing or very cold weather.  ,cars,cxw9zpo,1,t5_2qhl2

5971622,0,t1_cy24fwn,I want to clear up a misconception that people have about catalytic converters. Modern day cats carry the stigma of the horrible ones created in the s. Nowadays cats are rarely the biggest restriction in an exhaust system and most people do not see gains from removing them.There are people who cheap out and empty their cat with a broomstick or something but dyno testing has found that to lose horsepower due to gas velocity dropping. There are all sorts of high flow cats that are effectively as good as a straight pipe. Even with a  high flow cat or straight pipe you need engine tuning to make use of higher exhaust flow which is really only needed at high rpms.The biggest restriction is  times out of  the muffler which is designed to restrict exhaust gasses and muffle them. Most cars come with chambered mufflers which reflect the gasses back onto themselves and have sharp angles and bottlenecks that are the real loss of power.Either way a freer flowing exhaust will not give the sort of gains people expect from modifications. In most cases cars that are performance oriented have relatively well designed exhausts. With a full exhaust you will see some gains on the top end and possibly losses on the bottom end also strongly depending on your header design. ECU tuning is needed to make the most of modifications.,cars,cy2eslj,11,t5_2qhl2

6016365,0,t1_cy7zlrn,I disagree.  I drove a RX FCS as a commuter in Los Angeles.  A bit of a shame since the RX is one of the finest if not the finest touring cars ever built.  It was made for long stretches on the highway.  Which I did drive as often as possible.But the beauty of a sports car at normal speeds in the city is that you still have exceptional handling and braking.  I cannot tell you how many times the RX saved my bacon in LA traffic.  If I wasnt driving something so nimble I would have been in at least a dozen accidents.  At minimum that would have fucked up my car.  At worst Id be dead or severely injured.The RX kept me out of accidents.  I didnt have a single fenderbender in it.  If it wasnt for the horrendous mileage Id still have it.  I drive a speed  tC with the TRD suspension upgrades today.  Not the fastest off the line and it doesnt handle like the RX but it brakes pretty well and the suspension upgrades are plenty good.  Its not at all like driving one of the penis insecurity vehicles like lifted trucks and ginormous SUVs.  Those have absolutely no point aside from telling everyone about your inferiority complex.

6019507,0,t1_cy89g91,Yes! I did exactly this today. Its called a Helmholtz resonator you see those two pipes sticking in towards the middle with the capped end right before the muffler section? That is a Helmholtz resonator. Its essentially a chamber that gets rid of the drone I dont exactly know what physics go behind it but I know how to mathematically get rid of it.So first you find out the problematic RPM range like Mana says. In this case for my car it was around  with  RPM being the worst. By recording an audio clip of the incabin exhaust noise  I used audacity to figure out at what Hertz it was making the most drone. Turns out it was at Hz   RPM. So I did the mathSpeed of sound is roughly  fpsThe drone frequency was at Hz fps Hz  . number unit thingydivided by  because you need to find the length of the helmholtz pipe the middle pipes in the exhaust. .  . feet. which you multiply by  to get inches and it ends up being around  inches of piping for simplicity sake. You get a  inch pipe branching off of your exhaust and it should get rid of the drone. It worked for me today!,cars,cy8okim,7,t5_2qhl2

6033549,0,t3_3y3brf,Man this has me thinking about how terrible my GS  yes its not a car would be as a daily rider. Its an ex race bike as racy as a turd like this can get lol. The suspension on it would be ridiculous. Its much stiffer than stock and would be horrible on our bombed out motocrss tracks we call roads. The seat is a fiberglass tail with a  thick square pad. Not comfortable at all. You need to be in leather pants normally I wear denim jeans on the street but use all my other track gear or the stomp grips on the tank would be jabbing you in the knees hard. The rearsets and clip ons while fantastic for feel on the track with their aggressive lay on the tank ass in the air position leave me in pain after spending  minutes on it. The solid mount aluminim rearsets also have not the usual rubber padding most street bikes have so the vibration makes my right foot go numb after a while. No passenger seat obviously so no taking girls for rides. It also burns a ton of oil one rider in my group once thought it was a  stroke so I would have to constantly be pulling over for oil. I run the tire pressure low for the track so the tires would wear quick. Forget about riding in heavy rain since it has a KampN lunchbox for air filters and no air box. No rear fender either so it would exacerbate that issue and leave my back side soaked. The choke is a piece of wire that has to be pulled and held manually so I couldnt walk away from it while letting it warm up. No stands at all mounts were cut off so if I parked it anywhere I would have to lean it on something. The speedo has been blanked out so no clue how fast I would be going or any clue of my mileage until my tank were empty. No keys to the fuel tank so anyone could walk up to it and open the tank and siphon gas or dump stuff in it. The battery is also tiny aftermarket smaller size lighter and tends to go dead a lot so I would have to park it and throw it on a charger for the evening. That would make short trips of turning it on and off impossible since it would flatten the battery quick. I could have it road legal by putting the lights mirrors and horn back on it. I would have to put up with all those annoyances though. About the only normal things about it are the brakes which I feel would be okay for the street and the engine which is pretty much just a box stock engine other than the oil burning issue and the air filter being exposed in heavy rains it doesnt do anything different from ordinary GS engine. The tires would be okay too since theyre regular Bridgestone street tires but my lowered pressure would cause extra wear.,cars,cyaiiob,1,t5_2qhl2

Most aftermarket bars are proportionally stiffer in the rear than the front which gives you more oversteer at and near the limit of grip.If you dont like to drive near the limit on the road and your car has good roll stiffness to begin with then no you wont really feel much other than a slightly harsher ride over bumps on one side of the road.,cars,cym68t4,2,t5_2qhl2

I mean I loved lookingriding atin them but they were at his house and shop for years. He went through some crazy ones. One that he and my dad bought years ago was a hp black one with silver stripes I think and that was scary as fuck to ride in. After he made so much money restoring these totaled cars he started buying and selling cars with my dad at bankruptcy auctions while continuing to restore and modify exotics. Then my dad started getting a feeling he was corrupt in some way and we found out he was convicted of some time of fraud involving cars back in the early s so my dad completely cut off ties with him business wise.

6156894,0,t3_3zw776,Im currently going through the Subaru Rattle Hunt on my wrx.  If youre ok with digging into the rattles yourself your windshield panel might actually be the dash.  Try holding your finger on the clear plastic on the dash to see if that stops it.  If not that the panel near the vin plate or the panel covering the tweeter.As far as the door goes it could be a number of things theres a bunch of write ups to try to deaden it but it boils down to having to remove the panel and putting your own foam basically everywhere.  Im still hunting down a rattle on my rear driver door thats persisted through full foamage and even after I just sound deadened the entire thing...Subaru hasnt been super helpful with knocking out the rattles every time I bring it up they either apply some token foam somewhere or just say they cant reproduce.  Ive taken to just getting them myself.  Generally Subaru forums can be helpful since the rattles are pretty common but you get a lot of hurr durr shouldnt of bought a Subaru then responses.Outside of that Id just say try to hunt them down yourself or keep hounding the dealership.,cars,cyph3as,25,t5_2qhl2

Which enforces your point the popular car videos involve Lambos Aston Martins and super cars of that sort. My counterargument to that point is that car videos are saturated with sports and super cars. People have already figured out the nicer the car the more people are interested in the video. So I feel like super car videos have saturated Youtube. That is why I want to target a neglected aspect of car videos which is average cars. There is a small niche of car enthusiasts that will care about a Honda Accord track time.

So things like higher fuel consumption tax costs maintenance costs insurance costs can happen or some cars might be even more unreliable. I mean the taxes are depending on engine power so the higher the horsepowers the more taxes you have to pay. Something like  hp can make a difference of a . The Fiesta is the cheapest way to own a car. The car itself is probably even more worth than the  and you have something in form of a Wertanlage. You can later resell it or use it as a deposit or Anzahlung. I mean the Fiesta has everything you need and also has cheap running costs. You know the car and you cant do much wrong here.

What I can guarantee that most shops wont put the care into your car that you put in yourself. Small things like using the proper torque spec on every single bolt cleaning all mating surfaces and parts you take out wirebrushing any bolt you take out that has some surface corrosion replacing any little rubber part that is starting to deteriorate and put silicone lubricant on the ones that are still good so they stay such etc. If they did the labor hours would be off the roof. There are a couple of shops in town I trust with my car that do quality work but still these little details often lack.  Its all about the mental state in which you do a job. I was planning on replacing a timing belt on a UZ this week but everything is so hectic and I wouldnt have the mental focus to do it right over  days of work so I just took it to my local indy shop because I knew I would likely screw something up doing it at this point in my life.

He did get a  GT though so I guess thats good for him.The douche one drove an  or so V with a cherry bomb he loved to rev it out. I personally didnt like him because he was a douche and a compulsive liar. First he said he got twin turbos on the V.

6426795,0,t1_czk1ext,At the speed he was going the moving air from his vehicle can definitely produce lift. Lift is produced by the pressure differential between the pressure produced by moving air flowing underneath the vehicle minus the air flowing over the top of the vehicle. The flowing air underneath the car produces the lift while the air flowing over the car produces downforce. Faster andor more turbulent moving air exerts less pressure. Since the hood was off and the sunroof was open there was a lot of turbulent air over the top of the vehicle creating less pressure pressing the car down. The air underneath the car was still providing the same amount upward pressure it usually experiences. So the turbulence combined with the usual lift from underneath the car could have contributed to the cars unsteadiness.,cars,czk2gq0,10,t5_2qhl2

One of the main problems is where exhaust flow from the turbine exducer and wastegate merge generally right after the turbine housing in the first part of the exhaust in OEM cars. If they merge a bit further away like around the front pipe or just straightup have separated exhaust pipes all the way the sound will be a lot less muffled due to the reduction in turbulence plus theres potential to squeeze a bit more power out of the engine. anyone whos heard a Skyline or Supra with a big fucking screamer pipe will know what Im talking about!The same thing is actually happening in F at the moment Im hoping teams will see this as an opportunity to take a look at exhaust sound design in order to draw more sponsorship ,cars,czkcopf,7,t5_2qhl2

6430373,0,t1_czk7w6a,As much as those concepts for modern roads seem to make sense like in those scifi movies with cars moving super fast and close together I can guarantee you that the margins of error in modern roads are never going to decrease within  years in fact theyre likely only to increase and let me explain why.So think about it  automated cars are already hard to make as it is let alone be  error free. Do you actually think the engineers would be happy if they built narrow roads with less lighting and smaller exit ramps? Thats like half the margin of error. That means the car has to be  error free with half the time to double check itself engineers would go insane.  The only way to make these infrastructure changes are to make smart roads with waypoints and electronics in them to help autonomous cars navigate tighter spaces which again is not going to happen because no one wants to pay for that.Basically margins of error in roads are never going to decrease because if youre an autonomous car manufacturer the last thing you want is a tight and confusing road to get one of your customers killed and get you sued back to the stone age.  If anything roads are only going to get wider and better painted to reduce the chance of autonomous car accidents especially when intermixed with manually driven cars.,cars,czkft2s,2,t5_2qhl2

The aux belt tensioner had a design flaw where the steel arm wore it locating hole oval over time then flipped out of position shredding the aux belt. That was a  part. It was also on cheap tyres with loads of tread so it understeer horribly but I couldnt get the money together for a new set because stuff was always going wrong.The engine had an intermittent running fault where youd put your foot down to accelerate and it would judder and fail to accelerate then be in low power mode for the remainder of the journey. It went through  diesel specialists and noone could fix it.Finally the ABS unit failed meaning ABS always engaged at a few mph coming to a stop so the car would roll on at low speed. I got quoted  parts only to fix it I sold it spares or repairs on eBay. Bought an Sa SX and never looked back.It put me off Audis for life.

6442970,0,t3_43v309,what do you want out of your upgrades? appearance? performance? durability?Heres the word on big brake upgrades Theyre goddamn expensive and theyre not going to improve stopping distances under normal operating conditions. Tires and weight reduction do that. So when we gauge the performance of BBKs performance can be defined as one of two things  reduced unspring weight  better handling or  increased heat capacity. Because what a brake system essentially does is convert kinetic energy into thermal energy via friction. When the heat capacity of a braking system is exceeded that heat is absorbed by the fluid or it lights the brake pads on fire which result in brake fade either fluid fade or pad fade. This doesnt mean that BBK upgrades are worthless because some cars have brake systems that are undersized for performance driving Ss are notorious for this. Still the BBK is generally considered a last resort after upgrading fluid  upgrading pads  adding brake ducts. If youre looking for different braking characteristics modulation initial bite that can usually be achieved by choosing a different pad compound. SST lines will also firm up the pedal feel and are cheap enough to be worth it. And finally cross drilled or slotted rotors are purely cosmetic modifications that do not improve performance. In fact they probably reduce overall heat capacity and are more prone to failure. ,cars,czlqqst,1,t5_2qhl2

More torque is just going to make your driven wheels break lose more easily.Your point is right. But my understanding is that keeping it in a low gear keeps your wheel speed in check. If your in a high gear and hit the gas your wheels will want to spin incredibly fast and they will break traction and be spinning as if the car is going mph. Its easier to keep the wheels gripping when you keep the  car in gear closer to the speed your going.,cars,czsjqia,-2,t5_2qhl2

I get that a lot of people are not learning on a proper manual anymore especially in The US. But I thought rcars would be one place where enthusiasts gather and talk about what they love about cars not what is practical or economical. Manual gearboxes allow you to actually drive more parts of the car. Like unassisted steering or reverse parking without a camera. You are actually controlling what the car does and are more connected and present.I am not hating on autos  but I would prefer to live with manuals in traffic and enjoy them when im cruising around on a sunny day than always be stuck with a boring auto that tries to guess situations and invariably fails.Just my c.

Theyre designed for eight hours of use every day for years you want one hour of use once every couple months. Wrench set open and closed ends try for a metric  SAE set Socket and ratchet sets depends on your car you want a  inch set you probably want a  inch set and you may want a  inch set. You may find that you dont have enough room for a half inch ratchet and youre getting very little use out of it or you may find that you have tons of room and need a lot of torque and youre getting no use out of your  set. Anyways try for metric  SAE but for the bigger more expensive stuff its quite likely that you have mostly or only metric needs. Your  inch socket set will probably be fine for removing wheels but if you have something fancy you may want a small set of deep thinwall and maybe even that plasticwhatever outside coating sockets. In addition Id recommend a set of deep sockets probably impacts probably  but maybe  inch drive. Breaker bar. Half inch two feet. Along with that an extension set for whatever sizes you might you will need.   ... you may also find that some sets come with certain extensions already. While youre at it a small set of adapters gt and gt and the opposite of both of those and a small set of universal joints   . You may need some specialty stuff for high torque applications... some cars have some weird nut that takes like  lbft and you might want a  or even a  drive socket and breaker bar. Torque wrenches a  and  drive one for low torque and one for high torque. If you need to do lines brake lines fuel lines get a set of line wrenches. Couple adjustable crescent wrenches. Ratcheting screwdriver and screw bit set. Screwdriver set. Hex key set. Hammers small sledge maybe a small framing hammer what you think of as a normal hammer with ball peen head a couple rubber mallets. Pry bar of some sort. Floor jack and jack stands. Might also need something to protect your jack points if theyre shitty like mine. Get jack stands that are a bit bigger than you need  pound car gt get  ton stands. Theyre usually rated in pairs. Dont cheap out on these you are literally trusting your life to them. Oh and wheel chocks. Maybe ramps if they make sense. Lighting! Flashlights headlamps work lights whatever. Drain pan for stuff like oil. Funnels too. Gloves and shop towels. Various miscellaneous stuff. Hose clamps ratchet tie downs whatever.That should be enough to lift your car up and do just about any job youre physically strong enough to do and tighten things back to the proper torque. That doesnt include power tools though which you may or may not need.,cars,czvoz5m,1,t5_2qhl2

Once you get the front of the material off and all you have left is thick glue residue buy this stuff called aircraft adhesive remover. You literally spray it on and use the plastic spatula to take the goo off. Heres a link to the product but you can buy it at your local automotive supplier.

While theyre nowhere near feather light and Id love to see a lighter weight Z car I really doubt theyre going to shed another  lbs. If anything itll gain some weight due to the turbo setup and need for beefier trans and diff thanks to all the extra torque.

As long as it doesnt pork out to muscle car size Ill be happy and interested!Im sure well know more details about the Z soon since they tend to release the new Infiniti with similar drivetrain a year earlier than the Z. I think a  cylinder option like the Infiniti has would be a cool idea for a more entry level Z. ,cars,d04kt85,1,t5_2qhl2

That happened with my  Dodge Dart V after I replaced a leaky high pressure hose because on the new hose the fitting at the steering box side that had been formed slightly off center and would not let the oring seal properly.  I didnt have a fire but I did have stink and smoke.  The only other hose the parts store N  delivery trucks wear hats had in stock was defective in the same way.  I couldnt get the hose from any of the discount chains because their catalogs were all wrong and showed something with a  degree loop back instead of a  bend.  I ended up having the rubber from my old hose replaced.  ,cars,d04snup,1,t5_2qhl2

6699657,0,t3_47dltl,Sold my  Z to my mom and got a  Scion TC.It was necessary at the time. I bought the Z right before starting University and did not take into account the additional expenses that the Z would bring to me as a result of University driving. just for a set of rear tires  a fill up every week premium only this was when gas was ridiculous then other maintenance that was much more pricey than on my  Supra. Also note I did not work and my money was coming from being resourceful and smart with it but I was slowly losing more money to gas and other things  tires??!?! than I was making a month.And then the fact that it was a manual was killing me my University is on top of a San Francisco hill and for whatever reason that Z was the only manual car I could not master the ebrake trick on. It would always stall out so I was having to always be quick on my feet it was nerve wracking when I had a tourist right on my ass.So I sold it to my mom sold her Navigator took the money and bought a  Scion TC with K miles back in . It was a nice car a little too nice though because I was still parking it far away in parking lots due to how great the condition was far from the beater I was expecting it to be lol. It was nice paying  for a full set of tires or being able to use the Midas Oil Coupons again for a  oil change and inspection!

6716164,0,t3_47kvlk,Musings of a former BSMe student that finished his full course work before he decided that he would rather write code than design mechanical bits please take with a grain of salt Auto pilot will probably ship with every car even if it wont be mandatory except on some specific high volume routes. For example you may not be able to use certain lanes in the DC beltway during rush hour unless your autopilot is engaged.  Internal combustion engines for nonenthusiast vehicles will still shrink and keep using forced induction.  Hybrid and electric battery technology will improve at Moores Law pace so the sizes will shrink range and charge times will improve and price will make them more affordable plus by then charging stations will be as common as gas stations.  Safety systems and electronic nannies will make current generation traction and stability controls look prehistoric.  Carbon fiber tub chassis technology will advance to the point it will be fully automated which will allow it to be cost effective at the equivalent of todays K price point. We ARE already headed in this direction the Alfa C MSRP is .  Car makers are going to throw the towel and stop building custom entertainmentnav part of their electronics payload inhouse. Theyll retain control of things that deal with safety but the architecture of the center console entertainment screen how it interacts with your phone etc. is going to be open and generic. This means that if there are  prevailing phone operating systems in the world they will all talk to the car the same way and they will all use the center flat screen and the voice control module as a slave screen to the phone. ,cars,d0e0cob,4,t5_2qhl2

After that Id swap in the dual exhaust from a Police Interceptor and a limited slip differential if you dont have one. Next get some suspension parts from ADTR to firm up the handling.

The hinges are solid door panels are solid suspension and steering is still all factory and have had two alignments in its life. It has been a very trouble free car compared to others its age and mileage. I got the car as a  year old and I drove it irresponsibly for  years. I would say that Hyundais with a couple exceptions have the longevity of the more established brands. ,cars,d0ieoud,2,t5_2qhl2

6763495,0,t3_48dmq5,Toyota has W. Edward Denning to thank for this. His ideas about production quality management shaped Japans automanufacturing industry into  the powerhouses they are. Toyota was actually contracted by GM to help them improve the production quality issues they had. Toyota puts an incredibly important emphasis on no part leaving their production lines that is not perfect. Im not talking about measured to be within spec but to be measurably indistinguishable from any others part you could pull out of  manufactured. When I worked at the rental office for a Honda dealership and later a Toyota dealership you would not believe the amount of people with cars over  miles just coming in for routine services. When I worked at rental offices for Ford GM Volvo and Jaguar it was another story entirely. The overwhelming  of people at these dealerships were there for major repairs well before these things should have failed. ,cars,d0ix5un,6,t5_2qhl2

6764981,0,t1_d0j02ys,I really dont know much about stuff like this so thanks for the tip. I just did it through the broker service and didnt really know what to expect. In hindsight I easily couldve driven my car the  hours it takes to drive it. Despite being an adult my mother babies me and convinced me to get the shipping company to do it. Even after all this she still said well see... after I told her I would definitely be driving my car from now on. I really do feel like a spoiled white boy too having to ship my car like that it was completely unnecessary looking back. Anyone who I tell this story to looks at me like Im an idiot for shipping my car for this reason and I tend to agree with them. Obviously I got a refund and my car looks untouched after the body work was done so really I just lost some time and gained some useful knowledge for the futureI assumed with the open car carrier like you mentioned they must have not secured my car down properly or tightly enough so if my car was on the bottom level of the rig a hard bump or something couldve easily brought the top level down on my car. ,cars,d0j397i,2,t5_2qhl2

Honestly just drive the thing all year unless its some classic and I only say that because old cars dont hold up to salt and rust as well as modern ones. If its modern throw some snow tires on it and practice your preferred form of rust prevention and drive it all year.Even if it is some classic just drive it as much as you can. Youre gonna be grateful you experienced the car while you were young instead of stressing to preserve the odometer. Take good care of it mechanically and keep it looking nice.

Hes got a supercharged MR just like mine that has been in storage for like four years because it needs a clutch and he doesnt feel like springing for the work.  Every time he talks about it he tells me its the lightest car ever always says  lb.  Every time I correct him say they rolled out of the factory just shy of  lb hell argue Ill find a source on my phone hell be like Oh I must be thinking of the naturally aspirated one or some excuse like that then next time we talk its back to  lb.  His is bone stock mine is hopped up a bit with a supercharger overdrive pulley TRD header and aftermarket exhaust and according to the P.O. high compression pistons and portedpolished head.  I finally got it running and driving this weekend after a long time of sitting on the back burner took buddy for a rip hes like Nice but Im pretty sure mine is faster.  Yep his butt dyno tells him that his stock MR that hes not driven in four years is faster than mine.  Im like one way to find out bring yours.

When the engine is at operating temperature that coolant in the heater core is significantly hotter than  degrees Fahrenheit.  Any heat youre not using to keep warm in the cabin will just get dissipated via the radiator at the front of the vehicle when the engine thermostat opens.Coolant always circulates through the heater core.  Failures in the heater core have little to do with use of that feature but more the interaction between materials and hot coolant.  Plastics will become brittle and begin to leak over time or the metal heater core will corrode from lowquality coolant.

6886667,0,t3_4a1vle,So many replies about saving brakes and wearing out the transmission! The transmission has virtually nothing to do with slowing you down. It will downshift with roughly the same amount of wear as an upshift. The energy is dispersed by the engine speeding up then more is dispersed through compression.  Once the clutches in the transmission are engaged there is no more load on the transmission than normal and far less load than when accelerating. Furthermore all non locking torque converters will ensure a smooth power transfer between the engine and transmission to avoid any extreme shock load and the large majority of locking torque converters will unlock before a downshift.  The whole point of having manual control of lower gears is to be able to hold speed down hills and slow down if desired just like in a manual transmission.  As far as heat goes again there is far less heat generated slowing down than speeding up unlocked torque converter. The one notable exception I can think of would be older GM diesels with the Allison transmission. It used the transmission to slow down as the engine has very little braking ability but was designed to do so.,cars,d0wx5lz,99,t5_2qhl2

I suppose if you hold the clutch in too long for whatever reason youll want to give it a blip to get to the proper RPMs but in general upshifting is pretty painless.Double clutching is when you clutchin bring it to neutral clutch out.

6932565,0,t1_d11wg56,It was announced Im not arguing that. However they have failed safety crash tests multiple times from multiple agencies. When you have a car that is unfit for road safety standards you cant sell the car. Delays in production to bring the car up to safety standards means more money in rampd and no money coming in due to lack of sales. FiatChrysler is already taking a huge financial risk by reentering the US market and this is a major step backwards because they are not only behind and spending more money than expected they will have delayed production and will likely have to add weight to the car which decreases performance. The problems compound on one another because the consumers who would have been interested are now buying from another brand because theyve been let down. Breaking back into a market is hard enough. Letting your new customer base down from the get go? Thats going to cost them dearly and for that reason they may just get it up to standard for the European market to save time and money and sell there where Alfa has a presence.This is all just speculation but just because something got announced doesnt mean it will actually happen. ,cars,d124rjc,5,t5_2qhl2

6968573,0,t1_d167atp,Why on earth would you do liter restrictions? A pre s engine is going to make significantly less horsepower per liter than a new engine. My old  Suburban for instance had a .l massive motor. Despite its size there are a couple reasons why it should not be placed into a liter restriction bracket. Even though its displacement is large it only made  horsepower. Secondly It weighed nearly  tons and was not going to accelerate quickly even with more horsepower.Additionally liter or performance restrictions would not have assisted in this situation. I would speculate that much like this accident many of the accidents people under  are involved in are more often due to inexperience than reckless driving. ,cars,d1682p5,1,t5_2qhl2

Turns out that bit of orange was a Limerock Park M driven by a really young kid with another young kid in the passenger seat. My friend driving the F is also young as am I so we kinda knew we were going to have a good time. I looked out my window as they came up on us in the center lane we were in the right lane and all I could see were the biggest smiles plastered on their faces. My buddy downshifted and did a small pull the M popped in behind us and for about ten or so minutes we played a little bit of cat and mouse.

7007302,0,t1_d1ajt47,It makes a little more sense for them to manufacture it here than for Ford not to.Reasons for Honda to produce the NSX here. High price of the Yen means that it would be more expensive to export the NSX to the USA.. The NSXs primary market is the USA although models will be exported to Japan.. Bouncing off the nd point the NSX being manufactured in USA will not dissuade Japanese from buying it in the same way as if it was a foreign owned manufacturer.. Hondas leadership has faith in its USA subsidiary as a result of their successful product development in the past.. Honda believes that its East Liberty and newly built Marysville plants are more then capable of producing the high quality products which they sell.. It serves as a morale booster for employees. It gives them something to work towards in the future. By giving employees something to work toward it could potentially help reduce turnover one of the largest costs in running a business.Reasons why Ford would not produce the GT here. The highly technical knowledge needed to produce a car made almost entirely of carbonfiber. There are just a few handful of outfits in the world that have the technical knowledge of how to do this. Sadly the technical knowledge simply does not exist around Michigan or frankly anywhere else in the country. Even if that expertise exists the outfit that possesses it either lacks the capacity or the experience that Ford is looking for in a partner. This is hands down the most important reason as to why the GT is not being manufactured here. The NSX unlike the Ford GT is not being built out of carbonfiber had this been the case it is likely that it would have been produced elsewhere.. Multimac has a nearly  year history with Ford in addition to years of experience in motorsport. That longtime experience combined with their technological knowledge of crafting carbonfiber bodies is likely why Ford selected them to produce the GT.. Higher costs associated with manufacturing in USA. Healthcare instantly springs to mind as one of these costs.. Lower value of the CAD to USD means it is cheaper to export it to the USA not a major concern particularly for such a lowvolume car.. NAFTA making it easy and cheap to import from Canada.,cars,d1amfmf,6,t5_2qhl2

7034315,0,t3_4bz09v,To me the V is not in alignment with the attitude of the American muscle car. Muscle cars are vulgar ugly aggressive expressions of individualism and a modest V doesnt fit that bill when another two cylinders are hanging out around the corner. Sure you could build a V to be just as fast or even faster than a stock V no problem and a lot of people do it but then I just ask why not buy the V in the first place? Ive done the math and building up a  V Mustang with a turbo to compete with a stock GT only saves you about  grand. And you dont get the sweet sound of a V. I will concede that in the end you built something different with your own hands which I admire. But me personally I gotta have  cylinders if I buy a muscle car.     Another point Ill bring up is that when people rebuild classic muscle cars from the s a large majority them are V cars save for the few guys building numbersmatching V cars which is a different discussion entirely. I think that should tell you everything.    The Muscle Car is the V.    edit In a metaphysical sense there really isnt reason for you to get a V over a V. But if youre into the Muscle Car aesthetic like me then I think youre gonna be more inclined to go with the V. Its not something I can quantify its just the way its gotta be. I blame it on spending too many weekends at the drag strip and reading Hot Rod as a child. ,cars,d1dp15x,81,t5_2qhl2

I figured that since it was still on the boat and matched my configuration exactly with the exception that it had an expensive color which I fell in love with after googling pictures of it anyway that the outcome would be just as good as ordering it.  As well they instantly agreed to take off a couple thousand from the price when I told them it was slightly more expensive than the configuration I had planned to customorder.The only issue for me now is the miles which Im starting to worry about even more after the comments Im seeing here.

7052231,0,t3_4c5pep,I was a teen in the late s and back then American cars still sold in great numbers and the best selling car in America was the Ford Taurus.  The sentiment back then was that most Americans bought American cars because of pride and patriotism and this is what basically kept the American auto industry going strong.My history teacher in High School was a big critic of American cars and he would tell us some things that the workers at these American auto plants would do.  One of the things that my teacher talked about was how a worker would put a marble inside the door panel so it would rattle and this gave the customers a bad experience.  I always wondered why a worker would do something like that and why these assholes never got fired.  Last year I listened to a podcast about the NUMMI Plant  in Fremont and listening to the podcast not only explained why the workers were never fired but also how the Japanese way of making cars was totally different than what the Americans were doing.  You can listen to it hereThere came a point in the mid s where Americans were sick and tired of buying crap cars with their hard earned money so they went and bought imports and the rest is history. As far as Kia they use to be crap because they were an independent company and they didnt make good reliable cars and it was the same story for Hyundai.  During the late s Hyundai wanted to turn its image around and one of the things that they did was to offer a  year mile powertrain warranty on all their new cars to give consumers a little reassurance that theyre not going to be SOL if theyre new Hyundai breaks down.  Hyundai started to make more reliable cars and people noticed so they started selling more cars.  Hyundai went on to purchase Kia and they revamped Kias lineup and offered the same  year mile warranty.  This gave consumers confidence in purchasing Kias.In my experience Japanese and American trucks are the most reliable vehicles that you could buy in America.  Take a look at the best selling cars of These arent the best selling cars because theyre unreliable.     ,cars,d1fq93k,1,t5_2qhl2

7223965,0,t1_d1zacbt,They no longer try for top speed on production motorcycles. The fastest was  mph and theyre actually slower now. This is a quote from wikipedia I know... but its heavily cited.gt In  fears of a European regulatory backlash or import ban led to an informal agreement between the Japanese and European manufacturers to govern the top speed of their motorcycles at an arbitrary limit. The mediareported value for the speed agreement in miles per hour was consistently  mph while in kilometers per hour it varied from  to  kmh which is typical given unit conversion rounding errors. This figure may also be affected by a number of external factors as can the power and torque values.This article also mentions the voluntary agreement I suspect youll prefer this article as it talks some about the top speed development over time including various bikes and their speeds and has a chart near the end with top speed quarter mile time and speed at the quarter mile. ,cars,d1zb748,3,t5_2qhl2

It finds long ton and tonne but not long tonne.As to nd amendment the clause about militias is considered here a whereas clause ie a rationale.  The operative clause extends the right to all citizens not just militia members.  Some control may be needed but strict reading shall not be infringed says the second amendment has to be changed to get that control a tough process.  The Supreme Court says shall not be infringed means should only be infringed a bit not too much.  Hilarity ensues.

7372705,0,t3_4gatxv, IS here  drove the other cars as well all model year around ish.  So if you want a really bland ride with nothing really exhilarating about the car  get the Mercedes.  I was very excited to drive a Mercedes for the first time but  I just couldnt like this car  it didnt feel as planted as the others  just didnt feel like a quality ride and it was slower than the others. So it boils down to Lexus or BMW.  I had an e so naturally I wanted another BMW  test drove the  and the . Very fun Cars indeed  it still has an engaging ride like my e but smooth.  It was what I was used to.  I liked it tried to negotiate the i  with the dealer but he walked on  bucks so I decided to leave...salesman was kind of a dick and I didnt want to fold. So I test drove the Lexus IS  and wow I loved it  it was tight feeling like my e but it was very smooth  almost like the best word I can use here is butter.  It was slow so I had to try the IS. Fell in love it with  the interior was super nice  very comfortable seats  the interior is very nicebetter than the IS imo and the quickest of the .  It definitely isnt as engaging as the BMW  but the best word I can use to describe the car is butter.  Everything from the heavy steering  to the transmission shifts  the ride quality  the sound dampening  everything is just so well done.  Theres some small problems with rattling if you live in pothole infested places  but a lot of them can be remedied  but then again this is a  year old car now.  Still  mine is holding up great and it still drives like a new car.  Climate controls work great  ac can freeze your ass off  and even the non ML speakers just work well with the car.  I dont know what it was  but this car just spoke to me.  Its not a race car  but if youre generally a calm driver but just want to hit the gas in straight line just now and then  this is the car for you. ,cars,d2g84vf,2,t5_2qhl2

I can afford to buy a new Corvette Porsche but I prefer to buy cheap and have fun. I do all my own work so no big deal on the needier nature of an aging luxury import. I like the DB as its a good value finding nice Volantes for ish and honestly not near the price for parts as the Italians and honestly not horrific to work on.I bought my A as a yo car for k. The owner specced it out too. He lost roughly k a month in depreciation or roughly  cents a mile. Thats not including he just did the timing service and soared no expense so add another k for that and k for  new tires he even did the spare. His son to be ex wife decided she wanted a CLS and just bought one without discussing it so she had that he had an S and a Porsche  Turbo. He didnt need the A and just wanted it gone. Apparently he got rid of the wife who didnt discuss k purchases he said he did good financially but he never just expects an expense like that.My XKR was yo and .k with k. Its was a little over k new. So yeah even worse on depreciation.The XJR is a fun beater. Its in great shape but I paid stupid money for it. I bought it at  years old but paid  with k on it new was k.

Radar detectors are useless against LIDAR because as soon as it alerts you youre speed is already registered.

Xterra WD loved this car dearly. Took it on the beach with my dogs every chance I got. I was sad to let it go but my drive to work is  miles a day and it was starting to get expensive and too much to maintain at k miles. Tried to keep it as a secondary car but more stuff went wrong and I realized I should get rid of it before its worthless. current VW Jetta SEL still have it. Love it.

They are the real deal.The factory engine management is very good at what it does and was state of the art back in the day. The cycling valve is a old form of electronic boost control that works with the dme and klr and it can lower boost in addition to the klr pulling timing when knock is detected. It is quite good at controlling factory boost. Unfortunately the stock pressure sensor in the klr only measures up to bar so chips are required when trying to run higher boost with factory engine management. I bought my car with the lindsey instant hp kit installed. It livens up the stock car a little and you can up the boost to psi for little money. I cant wait to get rid of the archaic afm and shit though...Ive been looking into VEMS plu and play ecu I think I will be getting that next. It is cheaper and more modern and has a lot more features than some of the maf kits that are available.

These cars could pass safety tests without these features but the worlds best engineers spend tons of money and put them in anyway because they say they are safe. Formula  cars use carbon fiber monocoques for the same reason they are extremely safe compared to aluminum monocoques.And Im not trying to claim every supercar is safer than every road car. Im just saying generally when they are designed the engineers at least try to account for high speed impacts.

Maybe you could have included the mechanical things going on behind the scenes in order to explain why you are doing certain maneuvers.Nothing about reversing and feathering the clutch in stop and go traffic.Choosing shift points depends on the car.And nitpicking First is not always in the top left e.g. dog leg gearbox. ,cars,d2yr6at,2,t5_2qhl2

The MDX has considerably more room inside and a much largermore flexible cargo area.  We use the Avalon for general running around when we dont need more than  seats but the MDX is still the goto or my Yukon XL when traveling or hauling people around.  If I had to live with only one vehicle I have no doubt it would be some form of crossoverishsuv thing depending on budget.  I like to drive cars and love that I have choices but if you have to compromise with one vehicle most will skew towards the more utility of the choices.Honestly the line between crossovers and hatches is quite blurred.  Your  is a hatch  I suppose but the X is a crossover.  The difference is a few inches in height and a more upright seating position.

7606597,0,t3_4jhyiz,Keeping a Corolla running is practically zero cost but the LS is extremely reliable and holds its age well if you compare it to any other v Sedan of the era.What other high hp sedan do you know of that still persists in numbers as much as the LS? Sclass BMW series Chevy Impala SS and Crown Vic are the only cars that come to mind. In terms of looks I think the LS every brand beat except for BMW. So if you are in the market for a V sedan of a later era there are those options or the k and rising E M which is a very pretty car. But because this is your first car I doubt you are looking for an M so you are only really left with the lexus. Toyota and Lexus in the s and s really had to step up their game in the luxury market to establish their brand as being of an equal standard to german automotive companies. In all markets the japanese really made their mark in the s and s by making extremely good cars for all peoples interests. There were the toyota pickups and the nissan s all the way to the Skyline and Supra. Truly beastly not only in the cars they made but also in terms of company growth. But above all the overarching theme of anything Toyota in the s s and now was and will always be to make something that was reliable. So with an LS being a Toyota you will see that not only is your car in excellent condition but youll have any dealership readily willing to service it. Ive looked at dozens of BMWs and Toyotas of this time period and its like some of these  BMWs were driven into a pit of dirt compared to how the average  Lexus LS or SC or Toyota looks.TlDr Japanese car makers learn to make the best shit on the market including V sedans. ,cars,d36twm4,12,t5_2qhl2

I drove the Gen Coupe . hours twice a week for months and aside from the hip bolsters being a bit too tight its overall a very comfortable car for that kind of a trip... Im a big guy so I cant imagine trying to make the same trip in an FRS which my roommate owns so Im pretty familiar with it. Visibility too is improved vs the FRSBRZ twins. If not for the issue of comfort I think I almost definitely would have bought a BRZ. Theyre really great cars.On the track I could hang with my roommate in his FRS through the curves... But if I could put my foot down at all even in a sweeper the power difference became very very obvious and since the last track day Ive definitely learned to get more power out of the Gen Coupe. Take all of that with a grain of salt since Im a pretty newbie track day driver...

Never once left me stranded and fired up every time so long as the block heater was plugged in also never paid for any replacement parts and the only real thing that broke unintentionally was when the exhaust pipe came off and wrapped around the axle fixed with a sawzall.I could not kill that thing I tried by the end of its life it was running on  cylinders missing rd and had no windows and a triangulated roof.

I have a similar story but without the happy ending my great uncle who we were very close to passed. He had this little red convertible he had bought in the s in the storage garage on their property. I honestly dont remember the make because it was a European car from a company I hadnt heard of before and it was missing logo badges and such.           Anyway I really really wanted to restore that car. I didnt want to ask my great aunt for ownership of it or anything like that I just wanted to work on it and get it running. It was a sentimental thing whats a better way to honor my great uncle than to get his beautiful old car running again and drive it around the city its cherry red paint gleaming in the sun.                        To cut to the chase my great aunt started dating this other guy and she let his son take the car. I dont blame her because her new boyfriends son actually restores cars for a living and would do a way better job. And the car is probably worth a lot of money.                        Its just that I still cant shake my feeling that the car was more than just a monetary asset. It was my great uncles car man. He obviously cared about it or he wouldnt have kept it for  years. It isnt my place at all to tell my aunt what to do with her property and though I know she doesnt need the money its her prerogative. It just made me so sad when she chose not to let me work on it.                      I know my great uncle wouldnt have wanted some random guy to restore it to be auctioned to a collector. He would have wanted me to fix it up and drive it by the oceanside with the top down on a sunny day.              Sorry this turned into a long post. Didnt realize until I wrote all this just how much it affected me when she got rid of that car. My great uncle was more of a grandfather to me than my actual living grandfather is and I guess I just got really sentimental about it.,cars,d3gusi4,9,t5_2qhl2

7732485,0,t1_d3l38ef,A higher gear ratio means the car can accelerate quicker but the tradeoff is the top speed of that gear is now lower which means you have to shift more frequently and that can be a pain if you dont do a lot of highway driving.I dont know the actual max speeds of the FRSs gears so Im just using made up numbers for this example. The current . gear might max out at  mph where as a . might only max out at  mph. The . will feel quicker to accelerate because the engine can rev up more quickly than the . due to increased mechanical advantage . Think of it as a big lever. The longer the lever is the easier it is to apply force. The biggest downside is that youll end up shifting a lot more because there isnt as much room for that gear before the RPMs become too high.Heres the gearing ratios for the BB Sst .nd .rd .th .th .th .As you can see the lower the number the harder it is for your engine to accelerate. If you tried to start out in th gear it would probably stall. Starting out in st is a piece of cake so making st an even higher ratio makes it even easier for the car to accelerate.edit  I commented here to explain what the numbers of the ratios mean.,cars,d3l4n9j,25,t5_2qhl2

I liked that the windshield just continues into the panoramic sun roof thats cool as shit and I wish other cars had that because it gives you incredible visibility. But the fucking doors are infuriating. They have a complete mind of their own and they open and fucking close for no reason. The back seats are kind of strange and I noticed that they do do something weird with the front seat when you move them like he said. The jump seat is useless except for small children. It seemed rather cramped inside. I really wasnt sold on its utility. I think Tesla needs to work out whether it wants to sell extreme luxury to people at an extreme luxury pricetag or find a way to offer all this Jetsons tech for a much much lower price. And I think theyre going to realize why exactly car companies are so slow to innovate sometimes because when you roll out all this wonderful technology that people so badly want at the kind of volume they want to hit and something goes wrong theyre going to be in a world of shit. Cars are infinitely more critical than smart phones or web apps or whatever and a software failure in a car like Teslas could potentially lead to a serious death toll. Im interested to see how this all pans out. Im hopeful that they do make it and that they can overcome some of their issues.,cars,d3m7fpe,38,t5_2qhl2

The biggest difference between the S and the NC is that the NC is fun to drive at any speed. With the S is that the power is all at the very top of the rev range for around the town driving you might as well be driving a Camry. The NC Miata has a little less power power to weight its still definitely a quick car but is engaging fun energetic and involved at all speeds. By the numbers the S will beat it at the track but most enthusiasts argue that they have more fun with the NC Miata. And it has better handling and weight distribution meaning its overall safer than the S not by a lot but itd be an easier sell. That being said if you want to be king of the track the S isnt a bad move.Dont know a lot about the speed specifics but its worth looking into for sure.The Accord coupe will be the easiest sell most reliable practical and best all around option. Not quite as sportscar capable as other options but really they are a lot of fun and have plenty of power.

Doesnt matter if its a Challenger RTSRT Mustang GT or Camaro SS theres just something about putting your foot down at anytime in any gear and hearing that loud throaty snarling V roar as the seemingly never ending supply of torque hurls you forward. Theres just nothing like it. And Ill tell you another thing get yourself some wide sticky tires bigger sway bars a strut brace and that big bitch will be so much fun in the twisties! People talk about the fun of driving a slow car fast but its just as much fun maybe even more fun! to drive a big car agile. Theres just no sort of fun or sensation taking a lightweight car like Miata through a sweeping bend or hard corner at speed because the car can do it with its eyes closes so to speak. Theres no thrill to it no sense of excitement no hint of danger you just turn the wheel and the car goes. Its uneventful. You have to be doing like three times the speed limit before you reach any sort of limit in a light car unless youre on trash tires but something like a Challenger its very much an event! I love taking my car into the Texas hill country and flinging it around bends. Im on the edge of my seat and the edge of the cars limits and thats where the fun is. In a lightweight car going around twisties at the limit the slightest mistake and its all over youre dead. In a Challenger you can be going ths around those corners and only be mphs over the limit youre in no real danger. Get the Challenger. Its the best.

7883384,0,t3_4nadb2,gtLots of discussion about coming to a stop. Ive always kept it in gear disengaged the clutch even when it is not needed yet and then braked to a stop. Is this bad for my car?Yes. This increases the wear put on the release bearing. Its normal to fully press down the clutch before braking its a lot easier and ok. Its not so good however to keep the clutch pressed while at a stop. This video explains very well how and why.It always makes sense to put your car in neutral when youre at a stop. Just make it a habit and you wont even have to remember yourself of doing it. Be cautious about any incline of the road  if its a longer stop I always engage the parking brake.gtAm I wrong for having my clutch semiengaged and giving a small amount of throttle in very slow moving traffic? I understand that you can wait for a bigger gap to show up too  but Im talking about situations where thats not relevant.Lots of people do this. It wont make much of a difference but if you avoid doing this you can definitely reduce the wear put on the clutch.The best thing for moving in slow moving traffic is to leave a very large gap in front and always keep moving in frist gear so you can go without using the clutch and your brakes. There was once a video around that some truck driver made about how to move in traffic without using the clutch nor the brakes. Cant find it right now but its definitely possible if youre patient.gtbut how bad exactly is reffing up to k in st?Its not going to kill the engine nor the clutch if this happens occasionally. If you do this every time you are going to need a new disk much earlier than expected. As for the engine its not particularly good to rev up a cold engine to k especially if its a Diesel. The oil is thicker and cold so reving up will increase the wear put onto the moving parts of the engine.This is one of many reasons why race drivers drive warm up laps before the actual race,cars,d425ymn,4,t5_2qhl2

With an EV youve reduced your odds of these things happening to you at a gas station unless youre really into slurpees or something. You also get to avoid most of those junkies panhandling you for cash with some sob story while youre standing at the pump.With an EV you can accidentally leave the car running in the garage and you wont kill yourself and all the other members of your household with carbon monoxide poisoning.The majority of the particulate emissions pollution is displaced to areas where far fewer people live and those people are cool with living in the fallout zone around coal plants because they believe health risk from air pollution is just a conspiracy theory madeup by libtard environmentalist fags.You can drive it like you stole it without drawing unwanted attention from cops.EVs turn transportation into essentially a fixed cost because electricity prices dont have the volatility of gasoline. Your fuel cost functionally drops to zero since it just disappears into your household electric bill.

7899280,1,t1_d43xv9a,Yes it is an annoyance. Thats why they have been offering valet service. They drop off a loaner then take your Tesla in and then swap them back.But this isnt an internal combustion engine vehicle. Dropping the drive unit and putting another in and then an alignment is about an hour or so of labor with an experienced technician. The cars are designed for easy swapping of the drive units.The drive unit issue is akin to the Ford Ecoboost engine recall for which they did about  different recalls within less than a year across a large number of vehicles. That doesnt mean that the Ford Escape with the Ecoboost engine has less than a years reliability in their drivetrain. And the Ecoboost engine was being recalled for fire hazard.This noise issue predominately affects  and  vehicles and there were probably  separate issues that all get the same repair... drop the drive unit swap in the a new revision. Many  and  vehicles have a completely different drive unit and the incident rate for the high end performance Model Ss with the same drive train has drastically reduced. There have been other recalls... for instance the battery contactor in the  models needed to all be replaced. Its a  part inside a very expensive battery pack. Most were able to do it at annual service others experienced failure. The late s and s have a new battery pack design where the contactor is much easier to replace. Tesla has been pretty proactive with these sorts of issues.,cars,d43ybfj,1,t5_2qhl2

Cars that are a very limited supply and in high demand. If Ferrari would sell them in a first come first serve basis half of the cars would be for sale the next day for double the MRSP and the real Ferrari enthusiast who missed out because of the scalpers has to buy it second hand. This would do nothing good for Ferrari its image and its customers it would only benefit the scalpers.And the scalpers are a very real thing in auto industry or why do you think most new highend limited edition cars are sold on an invitation basis nowadays? Some recent examples LT Spider  R Ford GT  Speciale A and probably a lot more but we plebs have little no idea what goes into the process of buying one.I dont know what the exact rule set is to get for example a F TdF but I think because theres likely a lot more legit buyers than there are cars so there has to be something to differentiate the potential buyers even further. ,cars,d48ikb1,7,t5_2qhl2

8042965,0,t1_d4jfaje,I can get into a long debate about this.  I agree with you to a certain point. However Id argue that figuring out how to clean up the older broken cars on the road would both be cheaper and more effective than meeting the next round of emissions standards. Cars today are already pretty clean hell cars from  years ago were pretty clean when they were new. Emissions standards are already beyond the point of diminishing returns. I once read a study wish I could find it that showed a large percentage of pollution in cities comes from cars. Of that percentage a large percentage can be attributed to the olderbroken cars on the road. Eliminating those cars would dramatically reduce pollution. Maybe the answer is forcing lifetime warranties on emissions systems or another buy back program like cash for clunkers. Another side effect of more stringent emissions standards is that new cars get more expensive which makes good used cars more expensive which makes driving an olderbroken car somewhat of a necessity for a large segment of the population. Edit Paris seems to agree with this theyre already starting to put restrictions on older cars being driven in the city. ,cars,d4k3slz,1,t5_2qhl2

8068577,0,t3_4poobg,Enjoying the car is more important than fighting the car. If you buy a nice manual car without the experience then its going to be a shitty car until you learn to properly drive it months later. If you buy a nice automatic car you can enjoy it immediately.Manuals are more fun than automatics. I recommend getting a shitbox manual to learn in then once youre more familiar with driving with a stick then you can switch to a different manual car. No two manual cars have ever been the same for me. Driving a manual Maxima the car I learned on vs an NB Miata or a Mark  Supra  or any of the full sized trucks I have driven none of those feel remotely the same. The clutch pedal feel howwhere the shifter pops into gear and the gearingengine all feel totally different. The fact you are new to driving manuals and hopping back and forth between different vehicles are depriving you of continuing to learn how to drive stick. As you experienced once you started getting the hang of one vehicle a friggin Bronco truck then went to a fairly sporty car with no experience in you found a lack of skill and lost confidence. Also knowing when to chose your battles is important. I consider myself a car guy and daily an auto. Fuck sitting in traffic then rolling  feet then stopping waiting then rolling again then stopping and rolling again. Did this for  minutes one day and decided I didnt ever want to daily a manual ever again. Fuck me this post is kinda rambly but my heart is still there. Do what you do just remember why you do it.

8082101,1,t3_4puda2,I found OPs review a bit different from what Ive read of Teslas so I dug up some infoCustom interior  Custom interior   Both rate the Tesla Model S very highly. The back might be a struggle for people over  feet but it shouldnt be any problem for people under  feet. Its a luxury saloon car you should try the backseat of an Aston Martin Rapide S or the backseat of any car that does kmh in  seconds or less. The interior looks good enough to me.  All Teslas are built in America so er....youre getting American quality interior just like the ones in Corvettes Challengers and GTs.  The biggest difference is that the Tesla is a car that doesnt have so many messy buttons and dials all over the place because of that LCD console. This is probably why some people would call the interior bland because it doesnt have a busy looking console.  It probably takes some getting used to but I would pick that big screen over a million buttons any day. The boot and storage space is impressive theres a bit of space where the engine used to be and the back seats can be folded down. The technology in this car is simply incredible I dont think anyone who has driven and owned a Tesla will ever go back to driving a regular car.You really cant complain about a car that is pioneering the electric car industry and is not even  years old.  You have to remember that Mercedes have been reinventing their S class series since the s.  I would bet that the next version of Tesla can only get better.

It was awesome seeing the brave and skilled driving and the enthusiasm of the fans as well.Keeping the cars simple would help with recreating that it seems. Productionbased bodies with the necessary safety equipment along with modest powerweightex lbs and hp and very simple aero will keep things grounded. This will contribute to a bit more of a wheeltowheel drivers race feel and when the cars arent monsters thats when the drivers become monsters to compensate. They still want to go fast and theyll work for it. From a marketing perspective it might be neat to play up the driver personalities. Im not saying to go WWE and start writing stuff but show a little behind the scenes of the drivers and make them a bit relatable. Develop some crowd favorites and hype up some rivalries without making them combative. Dont need the drivers and especially the fans fighting each other.Id love to see the manufacturers really take to this and even start improving their cars so that they have some better platforms for racingex GM develops a new rwd Malibu to have a better production car to base their race car on. Itll mean better road cars for the public too but thats probably too much to expect these days. That said more manufacturers involved would be awesome. Get the Koreans in on it more of the Japanese and some Euro brands too.

8098353,0,t1_d4qa328,Thats the thing we can have cool cars and have great roads to drive them on but insurance is a killer compared to the U.S and Canada. Unless you are over  and have several years of claim free driving then expect to paying crazy high insurance if you even think about modding your car including aftermarket rims steering wheel suspension mods then expect your insurance to double or triple unless you have many years of claim free driving. I currently pay  a year on my BMW and Im  and thats with several factors bringing it down usually it would be around . If I was to say add a new steering wheel and cold air intake then it would be  a year if I went with some coil overs it becomes  a year and a turbo would be near  a year in insurance since I am male under  and dont have  years of claim free driving... most people I know mod their cars but dont tell the insurance company but that means technically they have no insurance.But it could be worse we could be Singapore,cars,d4qbt6i,2,t5_2qhl2

There are really good all seasons that work decently in every case dry warm wet or snow such as the continental dws tires I stand by them. However if youre looking for best performancesafety summer tires will always outperform anything else and snow tires will be the safest thing in snow and ice. When looking at summer tires pay attention to treadwear rating as something like a  treadwear tires is going to perform great but only last a few thousand miles at best. Versus another summer tire with  treadwear that lasts multiple years thousand of miles but might not help you turn as hard.

8143934,0,t1_d4vhrc3,The ride quality absolutely suffers when going to solid engine mounts like these. Theres no question there. Usually one goes with solid engine mounts when the engine makes too much power for the oem mounts or they allow too much movement which can for example damage a custom welded tubular exhaust manifold.I know my Protege just rips through the oem mounts because they used the same ones for the turbo version as the NA one with a  hp and  more ftlb difference. Its pretty common to go to solid polyurethane mounts on them and just suck up the extra vibration and noise so you dont have to keep replacing the oem ones.I think the point here was to try to make them suck less than most available poly mounts by using softer polyurethane than is readily available in other mounts A vs A or even A in some cases.

The Holden Comadore became the g in the U.S. because of Pontiac naming structure was g g etc.. Sometimes name in one country means something odd or different in another country.

8212942,0,t3_4rt01v,For an E in general Be prepared. For the car I bought? FUCK NO DONT DO IT.Exactly one year ago today I bought the car in my flair  ci for you mobile peeps for . It had k miles on it and I was fully prepared to test the saying you always hear theres nothing more expensive than a cheap German car.Prior to the purchase I had googled up every bit of research I could on the vehicle. Check out  for what is likely the single best source. I inspected the car as best I could in all the known trouble spots. The seller had a jack and let me inspect the rear subframe as well. Mechanically the car was sound and ran and had every option I wanted and my ideal color choice... but nearly everything else on the car was very obviously broken decaying neglected or worn out. Compared to my Miata of the same year literally everything plastic or rubber had disintegrated.I bought the car. Lets just say I had a lot of time room patience money and perhaps a masochistic streak. Over the next three or four months I replaced a massive number of parts refreshed aging rubber fixed leaks replaced wear components cataloged every penny spent and took pictures of every repair. As I repaired the car more broken parts and neglect showed themselves so it felt like a neverending todo list. I knew how to do a great deal of the work from previous experiencing DIYing on the Miata Youtube and efanatics filled in the rest of the details when I had to learn something.After about five months of working on the car in my spare time I started autocrossing it. It was still finicky due to a vacuum leak I hadnt yet fixed this was probably my  most encountered issue there are SO MANY parts on the e that can produce vacuum leaks but it generally performed fine. About a month later I garaged my miata and switched to dailying the e permanently.Its been a year and this car is the only thing I drive. I have full confidence in it because I know what maintenance has been done and all the trouble codes are cleared. It is much quieter more comfortable and far more powerful than the Miata. It has gobs of torque and the engine makes an utterly beautiful noise. I have no car payment for the first time in my life. The car plus registration plus parts minus insurance and gas has cost me around k in total. My spreadsheet is on my home computer so I dont have the full breakdown. I havent recorded my time spent but it was well over a hundred hours for sure. I had to buy new socket sets Torx and inverted Torx and maybe one or two other tools that I didnt already have in my collection. If I had a dollar for every time I thought I want to set this thing on fire andor get rid of it during the restoring process Id have enough money for a really nice vehicle.Perhaps coincidentally recently I find myself completely burnt out on the car scene and DIY mechanics and racing. If I could go back in time a year ago Id probably tell my past self FUCK NO DONT DO IT.  Then Id have calmed down and said find a wellmaintained model or look elsewhere entirely.TLDR Maintenance is SO SO SO important on these cars. I cant believe how many things they have that can fail or leak oil from. Find one that has been actively taken care of or be prepared for a considerable amount of timeeffortmoney to get it in good shapeedit another thing I would have told past me Dont fuck around with replacing the shocks  just get a complete coilover kit. And stay the fuck away with Harbor Freight spring compressors.,cars,d5467k0,1,t5_2qhl2

You have a rust problem that with paint costs will likely be at least a couple grand to fix out of pocket. If you sell it now while its still not especially noticeable or irreversible youll at least not be in a financial hole. If you wait the cost to repair the rust will increase as the car value decreases and youll still owe money on it possibly making selling the car into an expense.

The exhaust which looks cool causes the area your feet are in to be  degrees. The car had air conditioning but it was either junk or couldnt keep up with the heat generated from the exhaust.

See I envisioned that they wouldnt do another halfass M version of the series which is my opinion some of this opinion is admittedly borrowed from others as Im not a BMW guy of the Mi. Not that the Mi isnt a brilliant little car in its own right... it really is. But theres definite lack of M in it considering it has an N engine which theyve now used another iteration of in the M. Besides isnt the S just a modified N anyway so even the Ms not a proper M car?At this point Im just confused I suppose.

Theyre also way PC instead of a couple of boys having fun goofing around and genuinely loving it. Hopefully next season everyone will loosen up. Also more than  episodes! Extra Gear was OK but it was still so structured. They need a different format stop trying to be CMH. Personally I think the old F guy needs to go away with Evans.

The MaxCare warranty had paid for itself plus an additional  or so.One thing to keep in mind though CarMax used cars are generally a bit more expensive than what you might find private party or even at a dealer assuming nonCPO.

Wheres the engine rumble? Fords Vs have some of the best engine notes and best acceleration noises out there but we didnt hear either of those. Wheres the talk about the history of the GT the differences between it and the GT and why there are no current plans to make a  GT. Wheres the history lesson the discussion on what sort of image the car projects and to whom it appeals? Whats this the official car of!?Mr. Regular Im a huge fan Ive been watching for years but this episode felt flat. Sure my flair says I own a Mustang and perhaps theres a small bias at work here but I felt that this episode was negative loweffort and unmemorable. Remember when you were in Boulder and you took the FJ Cruiser up the Flat Irons to review it? Remember when you took the Wrangler to the disused Turnpike and drove it over rough patches to test it?

If you have two parts optimized to handle a certain loading condition where one part is composite and the other is metal then the composite part will tend to have better fatigue properties.

8443407,0,t3_4vb5bs,Depending on the vehicle you choose the best gear for the speed and just reengage like normal push clutch choose gear release clutch etc. Most Id recommend th gear for mph though if not th. Example  If you choose too low of a gear The car will engine brake meaning it will slow itself and increase in RPM. This can be evened out by adding throttle like a normal downshift scenario. Example  If you choose too high of a gear No sudden change in speedmomentum and slow acceleration. RPMs will drop but going mph in most vehicles thth gear wont hurt anything or cause them to lug due to low RPMs. Either ride it out as you might not need much power to hit  again or downshift. Example  Getting it just right or close enough The car wont slow any and RPMs will be pretty similar to what you had before. PowerAcceleration should still be available. Typically if its only a  mph decrease like in  just return to the gear you were in before. More on getting it just right or the sweet spot AKA clutchless shifting You shouldnt try this next bit until youre very comfortable with what youre driving and have driven a manual for a while as forcing it can cause damage. Certain road speeds mph match with your engine speeds RPM and will let you slide right into gear with no clutch or grinding. You can sort of feel the natural point by being in neutral and slightly holding against a gear say taking a slow turn and holding it against nd and it will just slide right in. Much more difficult adding throttle to match your RPM to whatever mph youre at. Either way get it wrong and you get grinding ranging from a bad noise to actual damage. It took over K miles in the vehicle I ended up figuring it out in and I could only do it at the natural speeds. mph th gear slide right in. mph nd gear same thing. I could tell over a while while shifting normally there were certain time itd go into gear easier. Sometimes it felt like the clutch wasnt needed hard to explain felt like it was kind of pulled into gear. In reality its syncros matched up and such and so I gave it a bit of pressure out of curiosity and figured out a few gears worth of sweet spots.  didnt exist and  was elusive.edit I dont know why Im adding so much but I guess I have time on my hands right now. Id like to add that in the scenario of approaching the red light try to coast in gear until braking is needed. Manual cars tend to slow down on their own a fair bit due to engine braking so I find it a good habit to leave it in gear until you hit around  RPM and then neutral or reselect a gear. Hope you enjoy driving a manual,cars,d5wyqa9,1,t5_2qhl2

Just measure where you are and where you want to be draw an arc between those two points with radius equal to the distance from each point to the center of turn. Take the tangent of that curve thats where the apex is. Take the midpoint of the tangent line and approach at a speed that is equal to the coefficient of friction of the rubber compound in your tires times the weight of your vehicle. Make sure you take into account the humidity and ambient temperature when calculating the coefficient of friction. Also note that how full your gas tank is will affect the weight.

A tesla battery is liquid cooled and has some insane fansradiators so it never really gets hot enough to damage it at all.Edit just read the article you were talking about if you were talking about I wouldnt really trust any word that person has to say if their main evidence was that their battery at full charge was only .kwh instead of the advertised kwh. Its well known to most tesla owners that your usable battery is only around kwh because tesla puts a buffer at the top and bottom of the range to preserve the battery so dumb people cant charge to actual  daily. Its also part of the reason id suspect why tesla recommends up to  for daily charging. Also worth noting when comparing Nissan leafs early models had no thermal cooling so you say terrible battery degradation.

8623495,0,t1_d6jj7tg,Yes. Ive found that whatever the chemical make up of the lucas stop slip is it eats away at the friction material of the internal clutches. The seals as well.If it works its usually a stop gap. Its supposed to help condition the internal seals and o rings and make the friction material inside on the clutches grippier to promote better shifting but it comes at a cost of destroying the transmission eventually. As the o rings and seals usually expand and blow out failing to hold hydraulic pressure. And also eating away the material of the clutches as previously mentioned.,cars,d6jjegq,1,t5_2qhl2

8624424,0,t1_d6jem7f,See ground clearance depends on what type of snow you get.  Deep snow all the time?  Yep you need clearance.  Do you get more ice and sleet?  I prefer a lower CoG and a lighter car ground clearance almost always means heavier when its car vs. SUV.But honestly a good set of snowwinter tires is the biggest thing.  I had st gen Michelin XIce tires on my  Legacy L which had all of . of ground clearance with the saggy suspension it had on it and I could plow through a foot or two of the powdery stuff.  It also dominated in slippery conditions.  Open differentials on the front and rear and it hardly mattered that car was amazing in every condition WI had to throw at it over  winters that I drove it.  It really all came down to the tires and the fact that Subaru AWD turned my car into a snowplow.I equipped my  Forester with Xice Xis when I got it  I figured it would be even better with its higher ground clearance.  Boy was I wrong  slippery stuff seemed so much worse with  lbs heavier vehicle sitting  higher.  Deep snow was good but it didnt have the same magic overall.  And before you say it was the tires I transferred those over to my  Impreza and Ive definitely got a bit more of that confidence I had in my .  The Impreza technically has a bit more clearance than the  but barely and it feels quite a bit better than the Fozzie did.,cars,d6jnliu,1,t5_2qhl2

8634021,0,t3_4y0efo,Hi Im based in the UK and trying to work out what to get for my next car. Ill be graduating next summer and therefore have a bit more money to play with. Im not in any particular rush to buy something and I dont want to spend all my money on something stupid so I dont mind waiting a while to save up a sensible sum of money.What I think Im looking for is something under k which is RWD with bhp. Id be keeping my current car Honda Civic Type S  as its not really worth anything significant second hand and it would be nice to have a second car. That being said in an ideal world Id like to daily drive whatever I buy more likely Id drive it at the weekends and maybe a couple of days into work.So far the cars Im thinking of are Honda S Nissan Z Mazda RX BMW i Toyota GTHonda S is probably top of the list good amount of power and reliability and I also dont think theyll depreciate that much.Nissan Z would also be good although theyre fairly expensive and also Im wary that they may have been ragged around a bit.Im well aware of what comes with owning an RX and if I went this route it would definitely be a weekend car more than anything and Id expect to be sinking a fair bit of money and time in. They are a lot cheaper to buy up front though so spending extra money on repairs doesnt matter too much but it would be a time commitment.BMW i seems like it could be fun depending on the gen I get I havent read up as much on these but I do like the interiors and feel.The GT would be more to the sensible daily driver side as I feel like itd be a lot newer and more reliable. Its also the most expensive and has the least power which is what puts me off. Will bhp vs my bhp now be a big enough difference combined with the RWD?If anybody got this far then thanks  please feel free to suggest alternatives. Ive ignored things like Civic Type R Golf GTI because I think RWD is the way to go which does limit me.,cars,d6kuys1,1,t5_2qhl2

If it was as bad for us as they claim then half of Europe would have their car in the shop getting it fixed and the other half would be broke from paying the repairs.Last time I checked the prices for similar jobs on a BMW and a Nissan were as close as makes no difference for example. Of course when you start going to authorised dealerships only thats when things start to get expensive.VW is by far the cheapest car to own where I live yes cheaper than Toyotas and stuff.

Factories measure it at the flywheel before a transmission is hooked up.Coasting with a gear engaged is more fuel efficient than coasting in neutral.  When you are under almost no load cruising flat ground you want the revs to be as low as possible.  While under load climbing hill etc an engine is typically most efficient near its torque peak and held at a steady speed.  To optimize acceleration you need to shift to maximize the area under the HORSEPOWER curve aka integrated as listed above typically at an engines peak power or a little above if the rev limiter isnt too close.  Operating at peak horsepower consumes the most fuel.,cars,d6ryyab,1,t5_2qhl2

If youre looking to just restomod it and get it running reliably and efficiently theres a load of carburetor modifications that actually make it a electronic fuel injected engine or make it function like one. Instead of gushing fuel everywhere it will measure out how much fuel the car actually uses and only dispense that much. Typically makes the car more efficient and use less gas while making the car run better. Many of these systems also selftune meaning you dont have to log into the program that runs it with a computer and put in your own fuel injection curves. For examples just look at this website here. DONT BUY ANYTHING OFF OF IT. Its only showing you what they are. I dont think they make anything for that engine you have anyway.Im fairly certain theres also suspension and brake modifications for those cars as well but those are a bit more involved and are only suited really if you intend to race it. But for now I would get the car running and actually learn a little bit more about the car before I did anything else. Knowing the engine code and chassis code is basically essential for finding known problems and solutions on that car. If Ive done my research correctly the engine code is L and the chassis code is S. ,cars,d6w5ah1,2,t5_2qhl2

Coupled with not much in terms of reviewing the actual performance of the car I wasnt a huge fan. I have to say Ive come around since. I didnt get at the time but its not really about cold hard numbers those reviews are a dime a dozen. He really does a great job of putting vehicles in context. With time and improvements its easy to forget why particular cars where considered great at the time or why it made since to even release it. Id still like to see a more technical show for older cars. There isnt really one that covers this many older cars and certainly not one this well done.

8763624,0,t1_d712r64,It had a live rear end in most cases there was a cobra with its in the early s  but especially later in the cars life the cars had been engineered to handle that type of rear end very well.  GT mustangs with the . post  were able to keep up with ms of the same era around a track even bumpy tracks.  The Boss  was faster in many cases.Even on a bumpy road at ths the cars capability you wouldnt notice it much the occasional slip of you hit a bad bump but thats sort of the limits of where things should be pushed on the street.The kept it longer than they should but live rear ends have a stigma against them that isnt really justified if you look at their actual performance on and off road.  Its one of those things that journalists can rag on but most of the people who can actually drive including the journalists who can openly say how people make a much bigger deal of it than they should.So yes most mustangs had live axles and that is worse than IRS in the class majority of cases drag racing being an exception.  But that wasnt what was holding it back for the most part.  People love the way the boss  handles.  What the Mustang needed in that era was a better made interior and a sexier more sophisticated exterier.The IRS in the Mustang did more to fix perception of the Mustang than it did improve its handling.  Part of that is because it got fatter with the new IRS but part of that is that live axles not as catastrophic as most make them out to be.And sorry about getting mad I just get endlessly frustrated when people get dismissive of any car especially for reasons that are inaccurate or largely inflated.  Mustangs were and remain flawed cars but they are also highly charismatic cars that are verythromycin enjoyable both in spite of and because of those very flaws.  Yes their vs have felt gutless at some points and yes live axles are inferior to IRS but it would be a mistake to dismiss even older gt Mustangs as simply underpowered and corner challenged.  In stock form they are fun and they can easily and cheaply be made into much much higher performing cars.I have spent a good chunk of time in both an older live axld Mustang and now a WRX on bumpy back roads and of course the wrx has better composure over rough roads but the difference isnt crazy and it certainly doesnt make the Mustang bad or something that should be dismissed.,cars,d7144pb,1,t5_2qhl2

Engineering consulting is basically contract work. The engineer or tech is probably making much more in CA now and thats why they were able to get him. Wages in Europe are not that high for engineers and techs surprisingly. There is a much smaller gap between employee levels over there. Its weird. I make more than my equivalents in Europe but the production workers in Europe make more than ours. We have expert techs come in all the time from various companies to setup their machines or tweak their systems. Its not THAT expensive and auto tuning is not THAT nuts of a subject.

The Suntek CXP carbon based step up from the regular carbon should be around . This is with installation for side and back windows. Whatever you do avoid a cheap dye based tint. They are prone to color changing  bubbling and peeling. Theres also metallic based film but these are less common and online reports say they interfere with the car remotes and TPMS. If youre looking to really cool down the inside of the car look into a ceramic tint. This will cost you quite a bit however.

Probably not but as others said below it happens.

Its not at all the fastest in its class but its fast as a mofo  we allegedly got it up to  just on a short onramp. Your neck gets exhausted from keeping your head from falling back when you accelerate. It kinda feels like a small version of mission space if youve ever been to epcot.I got a chance to drive it and the handling is amazing the visibility is good too except maybe the rear  and everything is wrapped in leather the tech is nice and a huge improvement over something like the XK.

8901963,0,t1_d7hvcxs,Im almost positive I drove one of those and wasnt really happy with the handling.  I think it is hp which was okay GTI is  I think but it had very little torque. Basically there are several that handle well Impreza and Mazda to name a couple but they all seem to have underpowered power plants.Sure I could always mod any one of them upgrade sway bars upgrade exhaust or chip. However I need a reliable daily driver  I average k miles a year... And modding can cause warranty hassles as reduce reliability. Edit So far The GTI and Impreza are my top picks. If the Impreza had their . T as an option it would likely hit the sweet spot. Its a shame they dropped the WRX wagon and STI on the Impreza only upgrades the sway bar and adds a fin with badging. My other options put me in a different price category CLA or C X or  series which I was trying to avoid  where the best I like so far is the CLA  Orange series I think?

Its too much a ubiquitous American status symbol to become a halo car.Thats just silly. Its is going to be a halo car.  its going to be GM best performing vehicle. Its going to be the very topofline. Essentially itll be the ZR in that itll be the top tier and itll likely be GMs most expensive car and itll be the fastest and most capable.

The mistake youre making is assuming that people view electric drive trains as some sort of novelty and not an increasingly demanded feature for the luxury segment. Unless you think people spending k prefer louderless efficientless responsiveslower. Beyond that the market can clearly absorb the compromise that comes with EV. Not just tolerate it the numbers suggest they fucking prefer it. Again unless you assume markets are irrational customers  choose the model s at  x the rate of every luxury sedan not named the s class in the United States because they perceive it to be the best luxury sedan offered. Whether it fits your bill or not is subjective but people dont buy luxury vehicles unless theyre convinced its something they want above the other options. Finally with respect to global sales almost half of the model s sales in  occurred outside the US if you take the sales figures in the states and subtract it from the overall total of  cited below. So I would say the notion that they sell most of their cars in the US is again demonstrably false. Im not sure what percentage of luxury car sales globally tend to come from the US and whether or not Teslas roughly  figure is impressive or not. But they absolutely dont sell most of their cars in the US. ,cars,d7q6338,1,t5_2qhl2

I forget what it was off the top of my head. I want to say  RPM? Sounds like something rattling really fast in a coffee can. The intensity may vary.That was a weak point of those engines. It just is. If you plan to keep it past k miles then you should plan on having it fixed at some point down the line. A lot of people run into the issue of well do you fix it or replace the engine. Because it requires removal of the engine to replace the guides anyways. The tensioners I believe can be replaced without removal of the engine. Those alone may quiet it down it all depends on what is causing the noise. Mine made it to k before i sold it. It was noisy but never failed or gave me any sort of issue.At k miles it may not be making any noise yet.

I checked the configurator of the Continental and in the highest trim you have what?  wheel designs  unitone leather colours and I couldnt find interior trim maybe the veneer was standard. In the A?  wheel designs  seat styles different leather options a way bigger range of leather colours  different veneers. Additionally loads off additional leather options like Alcantara headliner and fully wrapped leather dash. You also have an exterior sports package black exterior package no chrome etc. And if all that isnt enough you can choose from a even wider range of options and colours. Sure it costs quite a bit and yeah surely not everybody will spec out their cars but you can be sure the chance that your A is identical in every way to the one parking across the street is way lower than with a Continental Genesis etc..

You can search where it is depending on the model I think its usually drivers side below the dashboard simple unplug and your done.  Anything else would most likely be an onboard computer bolted down somewhere in the cabin but those are expensive below seats most likely and need to be wired into the car somehow.As a side note that port is useful if you get an OBDII sensor. It will give you error codes so you know what the issue is with your car. And if they are using the OBDII port using the sensor is a good excuse as to why it was removed from the port.Check here www.carmd.comwplocatingtheobdportordlclocatorInput the make and model and it will show where it is.,cars,d84kspg,6,t5_2qhl2

9092434,0,t1_d8415la,A little bit of a tangent but why does everyone shit on the CRVs all wheel drive? It reminds me of people looking down on the GolfR compared to the STI for its haldex system when only a very small percentage of people would be able to tell the difference.We have a fairly remote recreational property that we go to frequently in the winter time for ice fishing snowmobiling etc. Last year my Wifes vehicle was in the shop and we were heading out to the cabin at different times. So I had her take my truck newer more airbags felt better about having our oneyear old in there and then I was going to drive my CRV out there later. miles of unplowed rarely traveled roads after a snow storm and my CRV with its inferior AWD system and a pair of half bald Michelin XIce tires was totally fine. Also totally fine driving everywhere in the icey winter roads around the city. Was it as good driving to the cabin through deep snow as the truck with a real x system? No there were a few points where I thought it might get stuck as the snow was as deep as the axle line but thats a ground clearance issue rather than a drivetrain issue.Is it the right AWD system for performance driving? Nope.Is it the right AWD system for rock crawling and hard core off roading? Also nope.Is it a perfectly useable system that provides a lot of the benefits of a superior AWD system without a lot of additional weight for normal places you would expect to drive in a small SUV in a subarctic climate? Yes which is what it is designed for.I have literally never driven my CRV and thought a better AWD system would get me out of a jam. Take it for what it is a FWD vehicle with a straight line traction aid rather than a hardcore AWD system. Just my  cents. I really enjoy my CRV and I think its great at what its designed for.,cars,d84riph,2,t5_2qhl2

Also the Jeep has better ground clearance.Its a close race ... not sure what Im going to do.

9164305,0,t3_55tiqz,Lots of good answers already. A reason I havent seen mentioned is its  easier to manage on track for an experienced driver. Understeer is the norm on street cars because the front simply doesnt turn as much as you want and you scrub speed until the front grips again. Its safe for inexperienced drivers. Oversteer allows you to collect the car with a quick countersteer and you keep going without waiting for speed to bleed off.This doesnt mean you want a track car set up for massive amounts of oversteer. You ideally want the car neutral but depending on conditions theres no way to avoid having it tend towards oversteer or understeer. So you tune it to be slightly leaning towards the oversteer side. ,cars,d8dn577,1,t5_2qhl2

If its a nonenthusiast car or on a generic used car lot itll tend to be cheaper because in the US being a manual immediately eliminates about  of the potential market for the car. If its an enthusiast car and is on a lot that caters to enthusiasts itll probably be more expensive because they know just how hard it can be to find a manual.Last year I was searching for a manual Z.

9172551,0,t3_55y1a7,Because  demand far exceeds  supply. A car is rare because there arent many of those cars left. All the people who wanted those cars as kids now want them and have the money to do so. The surviving examples that sell for the most money tend to be in the best condition. So people have to fight for those cars against other purchasers and that sets the price. Precedent sales give sellers an idea what to sell the car for and then they list it for that price. Now lets say suddenly no one wants that car anymore the seller must reduce the price to sell it. Now there is the same amount in the supply but demand has diminished so the car now sells for less. The same goes the other way around. Lets say someone totals their F Miura or Dino the value of the others increase because there is less supply but demand has remained the same or increased.

If its no points just pay up. Itll be cheaper than hiring a lawyer to get you down to a lesser charge. If it is points get a lawyer  or try yourself but a lawyer is better to plead to a lesser charge that doesnt have points. Its expensive but you dont have points. Thats part of the reason rich people can get tickets and not lose their license. This works because they dont want to let you off and still need the income and you dont get any points.Or do you just want the least amount of effort? Then mail in the ticket and payment.Now for you specificallySince its a far place you might want to consider a lawyer based out of that area. The cost of the lawyer might be high but he might get you lesser charges a smaller fine and you dont have to miss work and spend gas money and time to travel.

However the reason I didnt mention it is because its considerably more expensive than the RS and Golf R. It mainly competes with the A AMG. AMG vs RS? Dunno but I personally prefer the RS.

9301674,0,t1_d8v0l9d,gt Second this is the level of rarity were talking about. Removing just one of those fatalities puts Autopilots safety record above the human average although as you said Autopilot is still operated in specific circumstances.Yeah we definitely dont have enough numbers yet. When you consider that autopilot has gotten  million miles since its introduction in late  and that the miles driven in the US in  alone was . Trillion its really too early to tell. Unless the  confirmed deaths are a freak anomaly its certainly off to a bad start though. Combine that with the not unusual reports of people yanking the autopilot out of accident situations and their sketchy reliability with the cars overall I just dont trust that system to be any better. And any company will deny fault in an accident as long as they can until theres just no way around it.Maybe Im being too hard on them. I just dont trust them though. They pretty reliably go for flash over function and gimmicks that get investors excited over mundane things that matter and that bugs me. They have so much potential especially as the first ones really out of the gate with longrange highend EVs. But I keep reading about shoddy workmanship reliability problems and poor execution on important things and all you hear from them is well fix it on the next update but never mind that check this out!

9333900,0,t1_d8z2kip,You dont necessarily have to physically go to a bank as many loans can be preapproved online. Typically you tell the bank what kind of car you want and how much it costs. They run your credit and either preapprove you or dont. If yes thats basically like them saying yeah this guy is good for xxxxx well back him on that. When entering a  amount of the loan try to aim for a ballpark figure thats slightly higher than your budget. This allows for wiggle room on price of the vehicle and covers any other feestaxes. For example if I wanted to purchase a car in the k range I would request a loan for k. If the price of the transaction only ends up being  then you only owe . So once youre approved print out the confirmation and take that paper to the dealer. It has all the info they need to pull the funds from the bank. Note that many dealers offer their own financing. In my experience the interest rate is higher than if you go out and get a loan yourself. So better to do the easy steps above for a lower rate.Edit If you end up not purchasing anything then I believe the preapproval is automatically terminated after  days. The bank will be able to tell you more.,cars,d8z51y5,7,t5_2qhl2

9338819,0,t1_d8zb9vy,The other cool car story that comes to mind is the Mercedes Es upbringing. If I recall correctly Mercedes began designing the E as a smaller sporty luxury car but also planned on racing it. Before it went to production Mercedes decided against racing it but the engineers kept going with the idea and worked secretly on helping develop the E with AMG before they had real connections with Mercedes to compete in touring car racing. It was so successful it sparked BMW to make a faster version of the  series to remain competitive which was the birth of the M. Mercedes now recognizing the cars potential got into the racing program but it was too late as BMW was back to winning again. Many think that if Mercedes had not backed out of the intention to race the E and supported a factorybacked race team from the start of development it would have wiped the floor with BMW and who knows where Mercedes or BMW would be at today.,cars,d8zrhto,2,t5_2qhl2

9444755,0,t1_d9cvx5w,gt Can I ask you about my car in specific? I have a  mustang which is a LSD but utilizes Trak lok technology. This puts it into the clutch type category?gt I run into issues a lot trying to get in my parking spot during inclement weather. I think its because of this  traction phenomenon you are describing. By putting a little e brake on I can essentially force traction and the differential to work in my favor when maneuvering scenarios like this?I dont know Mustangs nor am I familiar with TrakLok specifically which is a brand name but would probably describe a specific configuration set. I do however know that clutchtype differentials can be engaged or not engaged and that they use ramps to do this. More aggressive ramps mean the differential is engaging the clutches more which helps transfer power but can also cause some bad behaviors instability under braking is a sign the deceleration ramps are too aggressive. Its entirely possible the differential has an unaggressive setup that has it not working for you in that low speed low traction situation. Id say find Mustang people who are talking abut differentials in the same basic way and ask them my expertise is primarily with MXs and s and primarily on track.gt Why are LSDs marketed to performance and track spec cars?Because they can improve performance behaviors. Different differentials are chosen for different applications as they have different advantages and disadvantages. Mazda used TORSENs as their optional LSD in the Miata for years because it was no more maintenance than an open diff and should last as long as an open diff even if it isnt as effective at torque transfer as a clutch type. They dont expect owners of the entry level car to understand or care about clutch plates in a diff wearing. They switched to the SuperLSD type in the early s to try to avoid the  traction issue  the conical friction surface in that LSD should last as long as an open diff. It is a very real improvement  it maintains the low hassle while giving better behaviors for most owners. Mazda also expects the track rats like me to get the Mazda Motorsport diff aftermarket which is a clutch type. So its about tuning the differential to match what they expect most of their market to want.,cars,d9d6u8c,2,t5_2qhl2

9504520,0,t1_d9kkus6,gt If I had enough money to afford this as a second car then I would never buy this. The Civic Type R only makes sense if you need to compromise on practicalityreliabilityusability on a daily basis. I have a Speed that is worth K that I would replace with this car. So I need to justify spending K on hp and better track times. This means that Im basically only buying more smiles for my K cause Im not getting any more utility. For K I can ring a hell of a lot more smiles out of my X than I could out of a Civic Type R.Thats your specific situation that pertains to the value of a  yearold car that youre driving.  Its hard to have any sort of apples to apples comparison if youre comparing a brand new car to something that has depreciated over  years.  I mean for k one could get a used C Z but thats neither here nor there.What it comes down to is for someone who is willing to spend over k for a hot hatch is the CTR something they would buy?Some people will look at the impressive track pace of the CTR and determine its the car for them.  Others will look at the price and decide theyd rather have a MustangCamaro.  Still others will decide they cant do without AWD and go for the Focus RS or Golf R.For the CTR Honda is probably only looking to move  to maybe  units in the US at most.  Can they get there?  I think if the driving experience and pace is good enough yes.  If it falls down on performance is too expensive or has too much torque steer to be fun then itll get cancelled after  or  years.,cars,d9kmut5,6,t5_2qhl2
9504674,0,t1_d9kcn06,Good post but a few small corrections.Horsepower is just a unit of power.  It is not rotational work.  Power is the rate at which you do work.  So not just over how much distance did you apply your forcetorque but how fast you did it hence the rpm in product.Also work and power are not linear or rotational.  They are just values scalars.  If you consider the torque at the axle and consider the angle through which the wheel rotates you will get work.  If you then consider the force at the contact patch and the distance the car travels you will get work and it will be the exact same number.  Similarly youll get the same number for power if you do axle torquewheel rotational speed vs contact patch forcevehicle speed.,cars,d9knje2,2,t5_2qhl2

Youre going to be sitting in that car for over a day straight mentally being comfortable doing it is going to help a lot. I think the last guys averaged  mph? Someone correct me if Im wrong here most cars can do that without a problem so you want something that can eat up the miles reliably at constant high speeds but also something that has a quality ride. With that in mind I think Im with the MercedesBMW answers here. Honestly though I dont think theres much need to change anything power wise on any mid range model within the last  years from these brands. I just sold my i a year or so ago for like k that car with an endurance fuel cell and a V would be perfect. Completely comfortable handles great twin turbo for good power and decent gas mileage not to mention it looks good which lets face it if youre doing a cannonball you want to look good doing it.Ive actually always wanted to do a cannonball run type event or solo run but if I got caughtarrested I could be disallowed from taking the bar or disbarred for it so sadly I know I can never do it.

I replaced the motor due to the butterfly screw issue blew  holes in the engine replaced pretty much everything in the front end the exhaust system... twice the cat... twice Oil consumption problems iron shavings from the headers replaced the intake manifold all the brakes lines rotors calipers fuel tank entire top rusted out fuel lines fuel pump etc etc. The reason I didnt get rid of it sooner was that I only ever had k saved up to put towards something new.

For the price these boxes are hard to beat and I think if I upgrade itll just be a bigger US general box as well.If you go to HF to buy the box check out their impact sockets as well really good for the price and will help you fill out some of your socket racks.

9654501,0,t3_5d72ao,Automotive Engineer here. You are in a very tricky spot for vehicle makers as most anticipate a drop in performance at altitude and accordingly leave a small margin in engine calibration to account for that change. Unfortunately that margin is usually able to account for the change from  ft and after that the performance drop is pretty severe. But onto specifics.The first thing to remember is that NA engines dont necessarily lose power in a linear fashion due to elevation change since the power produced by the combustion process has to work to spin the engine and drivetrain and a bunch of other parasitic losses in addition to powering the vehicle. But these losses are independent of altitude so lets just say that we are losing power as a function of absolute pressure. In these conditions then yes a naturally aspirated engine will lose power at  for every  ft of elevation change from sea level. So that mean that the most power you will make is  horsepower out of the rated . From there it will continue to drop off as you go up in altitude.Turbocharging is different. With most calibrations that I know of a turbocharger delivers a requested absolute manifold pressure which means that theoretically you should never lose power at any altitude because the turbo will always deliver the same boost pressure. The problem with that is that as you lose pressure by going up in altitude the pressure ratio across the compressor gets bigger and bigger which will result in compressor efficiency falling off at some point. With a lower compressor efficiency your turbine outlet temperature will eventually hit a limit and the engine will derate to prevent damage to components. As I said earlier this usually happens around  ft so from then on you will be losing power and based on my experience you may see a  drop in power at  ft. At the end of the day it seems like a very close comparison to make and ultimately I would recommend that you drive both vehicles which interest you and put them through their paces. Pick the vehicle that you enjoy most. Good Luck!Edited to add TLDRTLDR Turbocharged engines typically start to derate at around  and drop off at different rates depending on how the manufacturer manages their derate process but typically around  per .,cars,da349iv,4,t5_2qhl2

It sinks during the year to reflect depreciation even though its a new car on the lot but most banks adjust the money factor interest rate to offset that. The variable is incentives. Whether incentives get applied or not depends on inventory and manufacturer goals. These can be regional and always change at least once a month. Equipmentmodel can change the deal too. Sometimes the best deals are for  months sometimes  months sometimes its  months.Go into the MINI section of edmunds.com town hall section to see if anyone is posting residuals and money factors for this month.

For example lets say we have a  cylinder engine. With each cylinder capable of expanding to a cc cubic centimeters volume we have a total cylinder capacity of cc or .L. That is called your engine displacement. How an engine with smaller displacement can make more power than one with a larger displacement depends on a large amount of variables and is a list too long for me to write.

Ive driven behind a brand new RX and watched the girl go right into a curb and bend her rims. Likely had it towed to Heffner lexus and wrote a blank check to fix it.

But not all are salty about it some understand that in the long run they might get a returning customer and referrals if they treat you decently and appreciate your situation.Some people will just say fuck it sales people are the devil anyway and pretend theyre seriously interested and then walk out without thinking about it. Others will be upfront with the dealer look I have many cars I still want to look at youre not going to make a sale today with me then the dealer can either send you on your way pretend to understand but still pressure you or be nice to you knowing this way youre more likely to come back to him.Car shows are a great occasion to just sit inside a bunch of cars you cant test drive them but at least you can rule out a bunch of them.Also not being ready to buy is a great way of getting a great deal. My current car bought used I only went to see it for fun wondering if I could live with an SUV needed more cargo space used to driving cars all my life. The price was already very decent but as I was walking out they kept going further and further down to a point where I said screw it this is worth it. No regrets.

9841826,0,t1_daqdgfm,Then you dont know how it works and you dont know what youre talking about. This isnt simply running a drivetrain to a rear diff from a longitudinal engine and tranny and its not the clearly inferior haldex system. This is a system developed by GKN called the Twinster. It uses  hydraulically actuated clutchpacks one per rear wheel to send up to  of torque to the rear wheels and  of that torque  of total engine torque to either of the rear wheels. This system is also capable of making torque changes  times a second. Because of this Ford doesnt need an LSD because the individual clutchpacks are able to manage torque better than an LSD. However it can also send  of torque to the rear wheels and just use the fronts for gas mileage. This is similar to the EVOs AWD system but doesnt require a center diff to achieve AWD and the Ford is capable of sending more torque rearward than the EVO. Now that bring us to torque vectoring. In a WRX or STI there is no such thing as true torque vectoring. All those cars are doing is braking the inside wheel to make the car rotate. It has literally nothing to do with the application of torque. Remember how I said that the Ford can send  of total power to either rear wheel? Turning left when you send  more torque to the rear right wheel and none to the rear left that forces the car to turn more sharply than if you did it in any other conventional system. Like I said the EVO can also do this but not as much not as well and it needs a center diff to do it. You simply cannot achieve this at all in a Subaru AWD system of any kind. Basically Ford managed to cram an AWD system that can send a ton of torque to the rear wheels without requiring a drive shaft going back to the front without a center diff capable of true torque vectoring with a transversal motor in an existing FWD hatchback and delivered it technically under . There are certainly problems with it and its not the most exciting car to drive so Ive read but to claim that the massive amount of AWD innovation in this car is marketing fluff is at best wildly recklessly ignorant.,cars,daqevka,1,t5_2qhl2

Turbo lag  more parts to eventually break  added complexity  added maintenance  more turbo lag. Why would somebody want a DD that has slow building power at the top of the rev range where it isnt readily amp quickly accessible?Better NA V over than TC anything. You dont want to have to always be at K RPMs just to have instant power. Thats surely going to kill any fuel saving you would get by choosing the TC cyl over the NA V.Plus a lazy V is going to be much more reliable than a modded high strung TC cyl. ,cars,db0wuuk,2,t5_2qhl2

9922604,0,t3_5hks3t,Before the tires spin out is a pretty difficult question to answer. The better question to ask is how fast can it accelerate before the load distribution changes to more than  rear bias. When you start accelerating you generate this acceleration force from the tyres of your car. However your car has inertia  that is it wants to stay at rest or at a constant speed. So you have a force pointing backwards acting at the bottom of your car and a centre of mass at some point above that that wants to keep going  and this generates a torque  rFIn essence your car wants to pitch backwards and this is what places the additional load on your rear tires and decreases the load on the front tires. The same effect with deceleration is what causes liftoff oversteer.So if you know the weight distribution of your car and its dimensions you can work out how much torque it needs to shift more than  of the load to the rear tires. ,cars,db0xuvt,1,t5_2qhl2

9940902,0,t3_5huz4l,gt It seems LED headlights in reflectors Like Volvo  series and Acura ILX perform worse than LED in projectors Acura MDX RDX. But It seems like HID lights in projectors are better overall. Volvo  series and Hyundai Santa FeNot exactly. First of all the grade is heavily dependent on the auxiliary equipment like adaptive headlights or highbeam assist. A car with highbeam assist will be given automatic one grade bump. Thus you cannot compare its brightness by comparing its grade.Secondly I dont think there is a strong tendency for LED reflector to perform worse than HID projector. If you compare the visualization of illuminations or look into the measurement itself Audi A LED reflector highbeam got better results compared to HID projector highbeam both in straight and corner while LED projector lowbeam performed better in corner but worse in straight compared to HID projector lowbeam.

9947657,0,t3_5hz8sm,In the case with this video its apparently due to it being a FWD Turbo. You want to wait to shift until the wheels stop spinning on their own as you get up to speed. If you were to shift to second the wheels would regrip and youd be out of boost and basically bog down or at least drop a ways out of the powerband which ends up being slower. Or so Ive heard and it seems to make sense in practiceAs for hitting the rev limiter should be fine because thats why the limiter is there to prevent damage from revving too high. Cars launch in different ways from NA to what type of boost to drive layout FARWD and the type of transmission they have. For example in a NA RWD car its better to balance the rpms to avoid excessive wheelspin on launch.edit To note in this video for launch hes also not redlining it hes balancing the revs. He does keep it redlined until the wheelspin stops and then shifts.,cars,db47e3v,2,t5_2qhl2

As a very small child my mother used to tell me The car wont start unless your seatbelt is on in which case she would always watch me hook up my seatbelt before she would turn over the ignition. Being a young and ignorant child I never knew any better. Over time I was conditioned to put my seatbelt on the moment my butt would come in contact with the seat. I even do it if I am moving the car from the street to the driveway.It irritates me too the people who still do it are pretty uncar conscious so they never gave it a nd thought but those of us who know better retrained our brains to think maybe I dont need to put so much force on this door for it to close.,cars,db6rx1d,1,t5_2qhl2

Slow down to go through the booth then do a quick pull from mph to  when my dash lights up like a Christmas tree and I lose power steering...

Same running gear same suspension geometry the leather even comes from the same company. Also its exceedingly rare for a sales person to be able to get the price lower finance manager is the one who handles that salesmen are yes men I had the exact same experience when I tried to get a Focus ST the sales guy had me at the price I wanted I suggested a trade in value they said it probably wouldnt be an issue and would call me the next day when their appraisal guy is in. Sales people really have very little work to do they dont handle the numbers they dont handle any real paperwork other than price quotes and current incentives they simply make suggestions and prospect people into dealerships good sales people will communicate and spend time with customers who have questions bad ones will pull the so what can I do to put you in this car today lt thats the phrase that send my hand in my pocket frantically searching for my car keys. Never got a call and when I called the back they said my trade in value was impossible and they wanted to sell the car to me for  more than we had talked about in the dealership.They are on a hope and a prayer that they get you all excited about buying the car that little heres and theres you will be okay with compromising on. Furthermore Lincoln isnt really a brand that will haggle beyond manu. incentives they treat themselves as valuable and prestige as BMW and it shows in the prices of all of their cars yet they are no more than rebadged fords with a slightly and I do mean slightly nicer interiors even the powertrains are unapologetically identical and their old MyFordTouch system basically had ford crossed out and Lincoln written in with crayon. ,cars,db8726i,-15,t5_2qhl2

Nobody else had one except for the kind folks on mx.com. The first online forum I joined that wasnt related to gaming.Ordered an AC compressor off there for  my dad had no clue about buying stuff online and was mad that I ordered from a stranger you dont even know is a real person.

I knew I hadnt wasted my money ordering directly from the site owner.Met one of my current friends from there after we spent two hours combing through a local junkyard looking for MXs and parts. A complete stranger and I bonded over the car and I still talk to him ten years later.The MX will always be special to me. Even now when I go to a junkyard I think of the endless days I spent at various pick n pulls looking for MXs I did find a few for parts.Ive looked for over a year for another one every time its either beat to hell and isnt worth restoring has some serious problem thats too expensive to fix or they just cant be found around DFW.,cars,dbht5ou,2,t5_2qhl2

10063567,0,t1_dbj7nxo,Well my personal preference leans towards higher end gear. The last set I bought from Crutchfield was a set of Kicker QS competitiongrade component separate mid and tweeter drivers   mids with  silk dome with ferrofluid cooling neodymium magnets and passive crossovers. They were . I dont expect that you would go that high.   Honestly? Alpine Blaupunkt Pioneer JL Audio Kicker Rockford Fosgate JBL Polk Audio are all good brands. The bolded names are common consumer brands the rest started off as competitiongrade but have diversified into consumer grade. If you dont mind spending a little more Id say go for a set that are about  thats a decent price range above entry level which will give you a good ROI in terms of what your ears like and actually offer an upgrade over the OEM premium. That number is fluid and if you like your music and sound quality dont be afraid to spend a little more than that.     The best suggestion I can make is to go to your local ICE dealer and shop with your ears. Every brand sounds different if you have the ears to tell the difference so listening to what you buy before you buy is important. If youre handy you can have a go at installing them yourself they also include modelspecific installation guides and if you dont like the sound palette or clash with the existing units you can take them out and try another model or brand. Be mindful of build quality and whats most important is how it sounds to you. If youre not happy with the speakers you get dont be afraid to take them back and try a different model.   Be forewarned its possible that the center speaker wont be able to keep up or may sound completely different from the replacements. Youll likely get more volume out of the new speakers due to reasons so there may be some imbalance. Its less important to match the rear speakers than it is to match the front since the rear speakers provide fill and help push the sound stage forward in the cabin but replacing the rear speakers may be desirable as well. I wouldnt do that until youve determined that they arent giving you the sound you want.   Good luck!,cars,dbjb1ut,2,t5_2qhl2

10103020,0,t1_dbob7jo,Corn stores just fine for ethanol anyway for a year or more. Price fluctuation is managed quite well with futures contracts without needing to change ethanol production rates. Even then ethanol itself stores fairly well for months to a year similar to gasoline. The reason ethanol mixtures change is flash point. The spark has to cause the mixture to flash. The most limiting condition for this is the cold start when the air and engine are at ambient temperature and the only way to heat it up is to start burning the fuel. So the spark has to work at the coldest outside temperatures in the region during that season. Gasoline mixtures change to hit this flash point with sufficient margin for different regions and seasons. It isnt just an ethanol issue. Butane for example is mixed more heavily in pure gasoline during the winter months because it helps flash point but is removed during the summer months because it can evaporate in summer heat. ,cars,dbofp8i,8,t5_2qhl2

10104477,0,t3_5kkraq,Yes there are but not recommended. Most lower end cars dont have a neutral saftey switch but just a clutch switch to not start the car unless the clutch is depressed. If you bypass the clutch switch accidentally leave your car in gear and use your remote starterx your car will drive away. Your parking brake isnt always strong enough to hold back an accelerating car. Also bypassing the clutch switch on some cars screws with the ECU and can cause the revs to hang when you shift.I wouldnt do it.,cars,dbominv,-1,t5_2qhl2

When you are getting moving from a standstill faster than usual you said you would obviously add more gas but you could also lift the clutch faster because there is more gas. What is the reason for this? How come whhen you use less gas you need to lift the clutch slower and with more gas taking off faster you can lift the clutch quicker?Also when adding more gas when taking off from a standstill why should you lift the clutch up faster than normal to reduce clutch wear? Why would adding more gas but lifting the clutch up slowly increase the wear on the clutch compared to using less gas and lifting the clutch up at a slower speed?,cars,dbqbqnf,1,t5_2qhl2

It would have been such a trivial fucking simple issue for Toyota to release the MRS with the ZZ from the factory and would have been a great competitor to the S.  The powerweight ratios make them competitive.  They put the ZZ in a Corolla before the MRS ffs...But nope.  Cant have that.  Too much fun.  Oh and they killed off their AWD turbo cars.  Oh and lets forget the fact that aside from one hp sports car the rest of their lineup for the past  years have been appliances on wheels the other two ZZ powered cars are not sports cars but economy cars retrofitted with the engine.  They just recently dabbled into the FRS but even thats a bit underpowered for its weight by todays standards.Even on my car they neutered the engine from the factory and set the lift engagement point too high so when you shift gears you drop out of lift and have to work your way back up to it.This is coming from a Toyota fan.,cars,dbr09yw,6,t5_2qhl2

Thing is Diesel engines arent as much about being fast but much rather about sipping fuel and pulling hard for a narrower RPMRange compared to a petrol engine.Mr Regular indirectly said it in this video and it perfectly reflects my experience with a similar albeit older engine. Its not fast in a straight line but when you are between  and  RPM it pulls really well.Especially when you try to drive up a hill having a diesel engine is really nice just a little bit of throttle and you dont have to worry about losing speed unlike with a petrol engine. It just feels effortless.gtAnd making torque down low is nothing special thats why gearboxes were invented.

You can get one shipped to your shop for  from ebay  Even the V RAV used the same motor found in the V Camry Venza Avalon Sienna etc. so its also similarly cheap.Id probably get a quote from an independent mechanic on how much itd be to fix the existing motor and if its close to the price of just dropping in a new motor Id put in a lower mileage motor and then drive the thing for another  miles.,cars,dc9unf9,3,t5_2qhl2

10300386,0,t3_5nflmk,Not that anyone cares but my generation buick regal actually got a little worse in the last model years as GM took out some features. The most noticeable ones were the electrochromic sideview mirror IIRC they dropped this feature and the performance shift button  the opposite of an overdrive button  basically just told the trans to shift at higher rpms and keep gears lower. Today thatd be called sport mode if someone put sport mode in a boat car that old people buy.Not that it becomes a sports car or anything with performance shift though at the time  horsepower was pretty decent for a sedan  the thing that bugs me is that I suspect that they removed performance shift because so many people complained.See the button is on the side of the shifter well gear selector  its a speed auto and its pretty easy to hit it without noticing it. When you do a yellow light pops up on your dashboard that says PERF SHIFT. Same yellow color as when you have a CEL or a service light or several other big fat warnings. And then PERF SHIFT doesnt really mean anything to most people they cant figure out that they turned it on by accident they dont read the manuals  and most buyers were old geezers  so they limp it or tow it to the dealer with complaints about their new car throwing codes and the dealer presses the button. And then they forget what happened because theyre geezers and they come back next year with the same problem.So GM instead of just changing the dashboard indicator light to a blue light or a green light or something just removes the feature entirely.,cars,dcblrt9,1,t5_2qhl2

Its not that nobody would buy a door the same human beings live now as did  years ago when you could buy all sorts of door vehicles  but now you cant buy a  door Tacoma or anything WD or boxy because their footprinttoemissions ratio is crap.     Fullsize trucks are inflated like balloons to increase their size more than their weight to meet fleet emissions standards for the footprint size defined by wheelbase  track width.

The BMWs are literally the same transmission as the manual version just with some hydraulics connected to the shift fork and a computer operating the clutch.  If done right theyre great on the race track but Im not aware of a single one thats good at low speeds.Dualclutch transmissions as used in modern supercars and certain VWs are in a completely different world from those.  The most important thing is the good ones use wet clutches like youd find in a tractor which can be slipped for extended periods of time without damage.  This allows for smooth engagement and mostly avoids the jerkiness.  At least with the VW one I could make it do not smooth things but I usually had to do something odd to get there.Dry clutch DCTs like the Ford PowerShift unit in their small cars are not very good.Mercedes has one that theyve put a torque converter on IIRC in theory that should be able to launch exactly like a traditional automatic.,cars,dcgp3g0,2,t5_2qhl2

But am absolute dollar amount is a pointless metric for most people. For most cost and affordability of the relationship between price and income. A Jaguar will easily run k. A Camry will top it in the s. So when that Jaguar blows a v and a replacement engine costs k with installation guesstimating. No clue how much the Jag v actually costs thats functionally equivalent to a Camry owner paying k for a replacement engine with install. Which sounds about right actually.

My parents dont have a car so they get to use the BMW in return for keeping it washed and topped up with fuel.The C is my everyday car. Its getting on a little bit now but its still reliable enough to use as a daily without worrying about parking dings.I use the MX in the evenings if I fancy a drive or as an excuse if I need to run some errands. I take it to work and back occasionally too it makes a change from the Merc.The C gets used on weekends or if Im going down the motorway.

10415217,0,t1_dcom48v,I think there are only two ways to have NAV not look like a relic in a car that you plan on keeping for more than a few years or buying used. Have the NAV UI heavy lifting just be farmed out to your phone which today means apple carplay or android ... carplay ... whatever they call it... and just displaying what they phone says to display.. Not having a nav.I very very purposefully chose my fun car as a car with no nav. No center console screen at all. Because they look dated and shitty.Okay technically I have a DIN aftermarket sound system that has an LCD but its a very basic LCD to show info about the sound system not a graphical display.Even if  and I stress if  even if you can get a car with an amazing nav system today manufacturers have very little incentive to update it and of course they wont be offering cheap replacement units every five years. On the other hand your phone gets updated regularly  apps get updated all the time and the phone OS and UI gets updated every year or so  and when you get tired of your phone you just buy a new one.But realistically apple and google have literally thousands of engineers and programmers working on UI and navigation not to mention god knows how many people constantly improving the actual map data. There is no way in hell that Ford GM Toyota VW etc can put as many people onto this one task. And of course if you demand an exclusive interface in your ferrari  shit how many engineers can ferrari afford to put on maps? Like four?And if the car companies farm this out in order to combine resources and get economies of scale... why bother? Just farm it out to apple and google. Use whats already available. Plug and play. Apple ships m phones a year android is installed on somewhere around five times as many devices per year. Cars cant touch those unit numbers.Since backup cameras are now required and I guess that means screens in the center console though is that part required?  if I was buying a really fancy new car Id have on my list of demands that it needs to have the best screen possible and then it just integrates with my phone. Thats it. Nothing more nothing less.,cars,dcomsiq,1,t5_2qhl2

If you dont set a hard limit somewhere a lap time is meaningless may as well just drive straight through the esses.

10547879,0,t3_5r0pdv,Just an FYI some higher end credit cards will cover you as the primary insurer for collision damage waivers.  Chase Sapphire Preferred Chase Sapphire Reserve Ink Plus Ink Cash Diners Club PremierElite Ritz Carlton CitiBusiness AAdvantage Platinum Select World MasterCard etc.  The one thing these cards all have in common is that you will definitely be paying an annual fee to gain this benefit but it can definitely be worth it if you regularly rent cars.  Heres a good partial list of cards that offer primary rental car insurance but the one thing you have to keep in mind is that these cards will do not offer liability insurance. Also Im certain that Amex covers neither liability nor primary damage coverage they have free secondary collision coverage but there is an option to pay for primary collisionloss damage waiver via Amex its like .. per rental depending on the coverage level you want.  But even with their premium coverage they DO NOT COVER LIABILITY as you can see right on their homepage so if you do not have your own separate liability insurance make sure that the car rental company is providing a reasonable amount with the rental or buy some.  So do NOT rely on Amex for liability coverage.,cars,dd3pxmg,2,t5_2qhl2

You can get heated seats steering wheel and mirrors as well if you want them.  I dont disagree that a Golf R would be a better daily driver if youre looking for comfort but listing things that it comes with that the Focus RS does as well makes me think you dont actually know the features of the RS.  They absolutely are competitors.  They are in the same segment.  Focus RS Golf R and STI all offer similar performance in that price range.  The Evo was there too.

I just said it doesnt launch nearly as hard on the stock  summer tires of course youd get a better launch and better times on a wider dedicated drag tire. Im sure any car with power to spare would have all of its traction problems fixed with stickier tires. The Demon is supposed to run in the s of course that will annhilate any stock engine stock tired GTR. But for all we know that could be a very different car to the Hellcat which is limited in traction.You can cherry pick a few peoples hero runs in the low s while ignoring the more likely midhigh  runs all you like but the fact is that theres quite a range of times one can get with a hp nose heavy rwd car on narrow street tires.

10622234,0,t1_ddbb08l,  my uncle restored old Chevys for a living and we threw this one together with spare parts for me to drive for a little while. It had a  speed powerglide with an anemic  cyl power with v mpg.    Probably the most stupid one was when my girlfriend was in my trunk. Some of us were allowed off campus to get lunch but my girlfriend was not one of those students due to poor grades. We hid her in the trunk to get past security. I did a burnout and forgot she was in there and proceeded to do some donuts. She screamed and we got her out. My friends were laughing but she was not having it.

You will be putting on a minimum of  per year so moving to a lightweight car is going to save you a ton on gas. The insurance is also stupidly cheap I have seen figures ranging from  for guys in their mid teens to early twenties.Maintenance is also going to be less of an issue with a basic set of tools and some garage space you can do anything to a small car.

10688051,0,t1_ddi9bat,A big part of it is that they start out with less of a handicap.  With few exceptions a  valve engine is already producing more power than an equivalent displacement  valve engine because air gets into and out of the combustion chamber more easily and what do you do to get more power from the  valve engine?   Try to get air into and out of the combustion chamber more easily.       Multivalve engines are already closer to their potential so theres less low hanging fruit to grab with easy mods.  ,cars,ddie5s0,1,t5_2qhl2
10688335,0,t3_5svhxo, horsepower is no longer hard it just costs money.Whats relatively hard is a reliable  horsepower.Want it to be reliable? Start with as large a displacement as you can reasonably get make it flow as well as possible give it a fucking monster cam and the appropriate valvetrain. A crate  from chevy which you can buy with a credit card right now and have delivered is already over  horsepower.But if you want more than that the answer is simple boost. Boost. Boost boost boost boost.The bigger your engine the less boost you need. The less boost you need the easier it is to build the system.Every  PSI boost theoretically adds your NA horsepower back on. So if you start with an NA engine capable of  horsepower you need about  PSI boost to get  horsepower.The more boost you need the harder it is to make the rest of the system reliable. Small amounts of boost can pretty much be slapped onto any decent engine. Go higher than that and you start to want to upgrade your bottom end. Go higher than that and you start to want to upgrade andor modify the engine block itself.Also if youre running high enough boost youre basically going to either tear down the engine every so often or youre going to have it break... pretty much nothing you can do there. So when you see an evo running  pounds boost thats probably an oringed block that either gets torn down ever k miles or it just pops and they reuse what they can and scrap what they cant every other year.,cars,ddif7yl,3,t5_2qhl2

When you have a daily commute in traffic and you run a business as big as Ramsays you are much better off in the back of a S class or similar getting work done.On top of this it is much nicer to have these tucked away as a treat every now and then. I highly doubt Ramsay gets a lot of time off so the option of flying to a racetrack where your cars are waiting for a few days of fun is appealing.

They were using an old Fiat manual gearbox that has been in production for years the .T was offered with a total junk Dual clutch automatic combined with production issues the good powertrain combo ended up being junk because it was paired to a crap auto gearbox and the base .L engine cars were pretty much exclusively sold to rental car fleets.

The basic idea though is that you can only make the cylinders and by extension displacement so large in a given block size so at some point you need to design a larger block to accommodate those large displacements.So if we look at the most common smallbigblock application the Chevy V we see that they designed a V and it was successful and then at some point they needed a largerdisplacement V and then all of a sudden the Chevy V became the Chevy smallblock V.Kind of in the same way that World War I was just The Great War until we had an even bigger one just a few decades later.,cars,ddio1sr,7,t5_2qhl2

Also since you can finance rebuilt cars you have to be able to get full coverage as that is required on cars with a lien. And as for people saying insurance wont pay out what the car is worth that is complete horseshit. Each company has a formula that they use when paying out for salvage cars and it is almost always  of book value. The whole couple hundred buck payout thing is complete fiction.

Some people will say this is a bad idea because you may get a slightly higher interest rate however most have very short prepayment penalties or none at all. So you may get a k car for k through the dealer if you use their financing and then you can simply pay it off a couple months later or refinance to a lower interest rate and still save those couple thousand dollars. ,cars,ddol164,1,t5_2qhl2
10748740,0,t1_ddomsit,The way you answer my questions is very amusing. You just spend time trying to prove to me that my approach is wrong instead of just simply answering with a list of features and moving on. For example you focus on how I said it doesnt have power instead of focusing on how you enjoy that car and how the power doesnt bother you because x and y. You also focus way way too much on your own personal experience rather than on you know general features of the car and assumptions as to the general appeal. Only to finish it off with you agreeing that its too expensive. Oh man.As for being patronizing so what? As mentioned before it wasnt really the intention plus if being pissy about making a lot of money is a problem its not really the problem of the person asking the question is it?Oh well different cultures I guess.,cars,ddonf89,-1,t5_2qhl2

The Mazda  is more fun to drive comes in a hatchback more fun and great rear storage and you can easily fit in those compact parking spots. The Accord is probably a bit more comfortable and roomy enough that  adults wont feel like too tight of a squeeze.Honestly just test drive both and while you do go through a list of bullet points in your head How comfortable do I feel in the drivers seat? How comfortable will passengers feel in the back? Does this car meet my potential storage needs? Do I prefer a standard trunkboot or a hatchback? Is the car fun to drive? How do the accelerator pedal brake pedal and steering wheel feel and respond? How does the ride feel comfortablesoft vs harshrough when Im driving on a city street? How about on the highway? Are there any annoyances that might get to me while driving tofrom work every day?Answer these questions for each car and youll have the answer.

10786740,0,t3_5u16yw,Wife and I are cashing in our VW liemobile aka TDI Jetta for a hefty settlement and rebuy in a couple of weeks. We will need an immediate replacement so we will be purchasing a car after closing the settlement rebuy. We really want a hatchback as we already have a Forester which we love. Money isnt a huge object as this is being heavily subsidized by VWs screwup but we are not looking for a luxury car. Right now we are sort of between an Impreza hatchback a Crosstrek or a Prius. I lean heavily to the Prius as it would replace an extremely efficient vehicle with another efficient vehicle and I have a decent commute where fuel savings would be really nice. My wife is somewhat skeptical of hybrids due to potential battery issues and is dead set against anything plugin due to the novelty and potential reliability issues even though the Prime looks astonishing and would cover most of my commute without any gas. I like the look of the Impreza and Crosstrek as well and we love our Forester and have had zero problems with it. In the end a  mpg car is almost too good to pass up in my mind but there are reliability concerns I always heard hybrid batteries keel over halfway through the life of the car and cost  figures to replace but maybe that is just propaganda. Any Prius owners happy with it?As an aside we really could care less about drivability and sport  I went through my sports car phase and its out of my system.

10802079,0,t1_ddu4kpv,Interesting.  I didnt know it could be disabled in that way.  What make of car do you drive?  While you can see behind you with the rear view mirror and by looking over your shoulder we have to often park in lines as straight as possible with no lines on the ground.  The easiest way to do this is to be able to see down each side of the line of cars that youre backing on to the front of and to make the image a mirror equal in both mirrors.  This pretty much guarantees that youre parking perfectly in front of the car behind you.  Where there are lines on the ground again its better to see the lines behind you rather than on the ground as you want to get the car in the middle between the lines and the easiest way to do this is again get the images in both mirrors to match each other.  I dont have the mirror dip feature on my car and I cant say I miss it.  I barely ever dip my mirrors and even then its only for very tight manoeuvres.  I dont hit kerbs to be honest the only time I can remember doing so is when I knew it was going to happen because of how tight the turn was.  I only have  wheels anyway so kerbing them is pretty difficult although the previous owner still managed to make a mess out of them.  ,cars,ddu5pbh,1,t5_2qhl2

Granted this point is mitigated if you have backup cams You get more space with a hatch vs. a trunk due to the verticality. Ive moved furniture in my GTI. Good luck in a sedan. Ever think that passthrough trunks were cool? In a wagon basically the entire car is a passthrough. You get a car with nearidentical performance to the sedan version with the tradeoff of the additional weight of a fat person.If you own dogs its so convenient. They have way more room in the back with the seats down than they would in a sedan. Basically you get a ton more versatility for basically no drawback so why wouldnt you get a wagon?,cars,ddv4jro,44,t5_2qhl2

If anything the  is more reliable because of a lack of complex window temperature sensor gauges that can fail and are expensive to replace and difficult to diagnose.  The most sought after though is the . A  STI with low miles low modifications CARFAX verified in this same condition? Easily .  And thats not really some shitty aspect to it. Its not like its not a valid evaluation. Name two cars that offer the same features performance and lack of compromises that the STI has. Name two.  You can only name one The EVO. And it just didnt sell enough. One of the key aspects to the EVO that drivers and Ive even experienced myself is that the WRX just feels more connected to the driver. There was something artificial and manufactured about the way the EVO drove.  The STI has stayed more or less consistent with feeling like youre basically driving a machine that was built to be driven to that limit.  Theres literally zero alternatives.  And dont even bother naming a bunch of cars to me. The Xi? Yeah thats a bag of expensive repairs that doesnt have true AWD. Mustang GT? Civic Type R? Golf R? RWD FWD and FF biased AWD.  Theres the Evolution and the STI and if you want what they offer True AWD turbo suspension braking LSD differentials those are the only options you have. Period.  ,cars,de08mjr,45,t5_2qhl2

But in the late searly s we were forced to downsize because of emissions requirements and encroaching competition from Japanese and European car makers. Theres an era of American cars that Im sure no American is proud of  in the s and s and you wont find cars like those outside of America. This was a transition period when we were trying to get our bearings on fighting the competition which weve only recently gotten close to. Now we have rather competitive vehicles in most segments and because of globalization many cars made and sold in America are very similar to their European counterparts  like the Ford FusionMondeo Focus and Fiesta. Conversely other cars with the same names as international models are made and sold in America but have very different reputations such as the VW Passat Beetle and Jetta.Lots of American cars are bought because of patriotism brand loyalty and the basic fact that parts and repairs are more readily available and cheaper rather than the idea that they are better in any way than a foreign competitor.

You tighten them when they become slightly loose very good design since it multiplies the life of the actual bearings but if you let them grind to dust you are in for relatively major  repairs.These preventative maintenance pieces are covered in the repair schedule but if you let everything just sit until it breaks it gets expensive.Another example is MB air suspension. The system gets alot of flack for needing  repairs now and then but the main problem is lack of maintenance. The system gathers moisture like systems using air do and the silicate grains that collect the moisture need to be changed regularly or you will get leaks which leads to the compressor pumping  which leads to very early pump failures.,cars,de154c2,3,t5_2qhl2

Bikes really only at a disadvantage in braking but they make up for it in acceleration. Look at WSBK times versus GT car times for a track like Laguna Seca  both are race machines based on production vehicles and times are identical. And for the average man its still much cheaper to race a bike around the track than a car.

Yes Im aware it requires polytetrafluroethylene fuel lines and stainless steel internals on fuel injectors fuel pumps and other parts that have the fuel running through.E is around  octane. Timing maps are much more aggressive so you can advance the timing without worrying about detonation as much. The powerband starts off earlier and it you have a higher average power band through out the rpm range.Team up with Garret and other turbo manufacturers equip them with Variable Area Turbine Nozzle turbochargers. They have vanes that open and close to change the turbine housing size. There are a few types of VATN turbocharger housings.The  GT uses it and they make so much torque off the bat.Switch some panels to aluminum so you decrease the overall weight.Equip it with a manual gearbox from the factory. Get rid of the video game gear shift buttons which require pricey transmissions with increased failure points and increases the complexity of ECU oversight. This should drive the price down. OR they can reallocate the automagic transmission cost by releasing it with a dog box straight cut gears which will help prevent the AWD shock from destroying trans gears.They may be able to increase the VE of the cylinder head by having a dedicated CNC in the factorymachine port the cylinder head to increase flow.I think that would make it a drivers car today opposed to many manufacturers who are advertising touchscreen displays pandora capability rear cameras etc.TLDRE half a point bump in static compressionVATN turboaluminum panelsdog boxCNC factory port for VEedit additions,cars,de9jfed,1,t5_2qhl2

One of the main reasons that I ended up buying a GTI is because of the dealership experience.  I had to beg to test drive a WRX while the salesman treated me like some sort of hobo who couldnt afford their prestigious car.  Meanwhile I had a GTI enthusiast at the VW dealership who was encouraging me to take the car out on longer test drives.,cars,dec641c,11,t5_2qhl2

I was serious about selling my car then and there because mini really infuriated me with an incident. I was looking at  cars Fiesta ST Focus ST Ecoboost mustang and V Mustang all within the same insurance rate. They flat out denied me I responded Right so I have my car paid in full I am ready to sign today I am done with that car. Sales dude responded Well those cars are highly sought out cars and owners want them with low millage. I just left he wasnt willing to make it I wasnt willing to waste my time. I think a lot has to do with age I am  and so they do not think that I can afford it. They all are shocked when I tell them I have paid off my car in full which is true however they are probably thinking something that cost K not K. I dont go to dealers without my father around despite the sound they will not take me serious at all. He will set up the deal and then send it to me so they cannot back out without being assholes. ,cars,deckenp,1,t5_2qhl2

They sent me a pamphlet in the mail that said come in for a checkup and text drive the new WRX!So I did just that. But when I went into the showroom the sales person was very standoffish. He basically said to me yeah every  year old kid wants to come romp on the WRXs. But Im busy I got pissed off. I let him know that my paid off three year old WRX was in their shop as we spoke. And I expected him to do his job because I was thinking of upgrading.When we finally finished his begrudging test drive I told him thanks but no thanks. And left.Still have that WRX  years later.

10986969,0,t3_5wu6n3,If this was a city cop even more kudos to him. It sounds like it was. In my experience Highway Patrol California are far more likely to be courteous professional and willing to nonticket.    The only time Ive been pulled over for a similar speed I was going over  in a  Saturn SL. But I wasnt in a  zone I was on the freeway. My daughter had her SAT that morning and I was running late to pick her up. My ex doesnt drive so it was up to me. I was feeling sooo screwed when I saw the CHP with lights behind me as I exited.    When he got to the car I pleaded to please let me take care of this later and explained why I was in such a hurry and promised to obey the limit the rest of the day. He paused a second then told me he was letting me go because HE had a daughter taking the SAT that morning too. I did get her there on time.   At the other end of the spectrum when I was  my fiance and I were headed to my parents house to let them know she was my fiance. We were late I know you see a pattern here and traveling on a wide boulevard without a turn lane. Speed limit  mph  going about . Ahead of me I see a car waiting for a chance to turn left. The same street he is waiting to to turn onto but on my side offset by about  feet has a city cop running radar. As soon as I saw him I knew I was toast. Foot came off the accelertor as I passed the turner on the right and started watching my rear view mirror. Im not seeing the cop so I keep going at about . Very long block and as I figure if I turn at the next corner theres a chance he wont see where I went Ill lose him and Ill dodge a ticket. Just before I turned but was already committed I see him come into view turning onto the boulevard with lights on. I decide to still try. Maybe he didnt have time to see me. Maybe Im far enough ahead and can find a good place to turn to before he sees. It turns out there arent any good places to turn to and I end up just trying to circle the block. I was almost to the rd turn which would put me on the street the cop was on when I passed him when I see him round the corner. At this point I knew I had lost and pulled over.  The cop had a ridealong and wore motorcycle cop boots and helmet and he smoked a cigar. He wrote me up for reckless driving speeding passing on the right and as it turned out driving without a license on my person. I had left my wallet on the bed at home due to being in a hurry. I beat the reckless driving in court and hindsight told me I could have gotten the entire ticket thrown out since the cop testified he was riding his Kawasaki and in fact had been in a cruiser.    Ive had quite a few tickets in my life. Im  now and finally dont get so many. Its been over  years since the last one. In all those years there has never been one city cop who treated me with as much class as the most dickish of CHP officers.  That doesnt mean I didnt get tickets from the CHP but they always treated me with respect. They said please and thank you. They spoke to me like they were a clerk at a store where the clerks are fired if they piss off the clientele. They didnt act like they wanted to push me to the ground and start beating me or like it was putting them out to have to spend their time with the likes of me just because I had been speeding.     Oh and I was given that speech about the difference between a child and an adult at some point probably more than once when growing up. I like to think it made an impact. ,cars,dedc6mh,1,t5_2qhl2

11014460,0,t1_degg5qu,There is a universal Mustang shift knob that shows the gear on a segment display. I believe it works with accelerometers. I digress I dont like this way of doing it. Id be using the rpmspeed comparison to determine current gear. Then at the time of clutchin capture the rpm as a variable. Say pre intent rpm.Then for a down shift if the engine revs up OR the brakes are pressed begin providing tonal feedback for Rev matching down shifts.For an up shift if the clutch is pressed and TPS drops and stays off begin providing tonal feedback for when the revs have dropped low enough. On the Mustang unfortunately the revs like to hang. A lot. Smooth shifting  on a flat surface for example can take  or more seconds if you beans it. Its frustrating.

11050892,0,t3_5xpgst,This is easy. When I first started selling I had a woman come in looking to sell her Escalade. Shes got a PAID OFF  year old black diamond Escalade that cost about K MSRP. While were waiting for the appraisal to finish she starts talking to me about all these famous people she and her family know. Shes showing me pictures of them on her phone and just wont stop talking about how wealthy she is. This lady is about  years old and drops the name of some bombshell woman from the s who I dont know. Im pretty annoyed at her so I dont even bother pretending to know who this woman is. When I ask who that is she says incredulously Are you gay?  Ive just gone from annoyed to pissed. Im about  and you expect me to know who some model is from the s? Fuck off. She proceeds to tell me more stories about her wealth and Im just praying for this appraisal to hurry up. A couple minutes later its done. We offer K or so. She wants to sell it but on the condition we split the checks up into seven amounts. Im pretty confused and ask why.  Well if I deposit any checks over k then my husband and I will lose our Social Security. Im fucking floored now. Ive spent a half hour with her hearing all these stories about how wealthy she is how many famous people she knows how much power she has and now she wants me to help her abuse Social Security? First off I cant do that but secondly even if I could theres not a chance in hell I would. Like Im going to help you scam the system for welfare benefits while knowing you can afford a fucking Escalade. Unreal. I should mention that Im not a tax expert nor welfare expert. I dont know if she was trying to evade taxes or what exactly. Im just quoting what she said. Also when I told her to have a good day I didnt actually mean it.,cars,deklldp,5,t5_2qhl2

They already developed the completed product why not just sell it  unless they need to determine how much public interest there is?  Their ad is too much drama too much story too much irrelevant information. REAL advertisements get straight to the point theyre trying too hard to sell you. Did they just hire a Russian guy with an accent so that we think he sounds smart or something. Plus all he says are BS buzzwords. His role in the ad is useless. Those electron microscope images could be literally any fucking thing.  They just show goddam ESEM images of smooth and rough surfaces. THEY HAVE NO REAL LIFE ENGINE TO SHOW FOR IT. No real world example is a red flag. Theyre not the first ones to use ceramic nanoparticles as oil additives. Liqui Moly has a ceramic oil additive other companies have oil additives etc. Modern engines are already designed to work well within their respective tolerances. Filling in little gaps are going to have negligible results.  NONE OF THOSE IMAGES look like real engine worn parts. Any part worn in an engine has long straight wear marks due to constantly repeated motions. Like a ridge straight up and down along the cylinder wall due to a bad piston ring going up and down millions of times.  I call BS on the images for a second timeBasically it sounds too good to be true. Nothing that good needs that much marketing.

Before the g i swore i didnt need certain luxuries but ive grown accustomed to it and also want something that performs well. Those cars are never cheap. For me getting the lexus would be almost quitting on cars. Not that its a bad car but it would be giving up the features i prefer most which is a  speed manual and something sportier but theres also the appeal of reliability and a well designed cabin.  Also in my late s so this is probably the last time i can get a coupe for a while so thats on my mind. Ive always had a bias against american cars but this might be a time to see what theyre all about. Straight line speed isnt the main priority here. Still want something maneuverable. Ive got a handful of cars im going to have to test but at this point with the car issues ive had in the past im thinking if the lexus just might be the way to go. ,cars,deq9ztl,1,t5_2qhl2

11183631,0,t3_5zlsp0,Pretty much the additive packages like others mentioned wregards to gasoline.  Since you said fuel though Ill add that there can be quite a big difference between one place and the next regardless of label when it comes to diesel.  Its often recommended to fill up at places that see lots of demand for diesel vs maybe a place across the street that for whatever reason doesnt see as much demand.  The reason is the likelihood of water contamination and supposedly though I havent noticed it at any station but have in private holding tanks algae growth in the diesel from stations that dont sell much of it.  So the best station in a given area for diesel might very well be a supermarket or it might be that dirty place on the edge of town.  In places where diesel use is quite common pretty much all the stations are the same quality assuming their tanks are good.   Edit Only referencing the US.  ,cars,deznh01,1,t5_2qhl2

11193010,0,t1_df0ncmt,I really dont agree and the reliability of Challengers since then would agree with me I recall seeing its in the bottom  cars in Consumer Reports a year or two ago. The .L was used for a very long time in a lot of cars prior to the . change which added HP and MPG both needed. My biggest gripe with the . was the interference design with a timing belt vs chain. I never had an issue in  miles before it was gone and Im not sure the car couldve been more abused than what I had done.I would hope the car  years later would have a better interior... The new interior is definitely an improvement but mine was perfectly fine. There are a lot of other subtle changes after  that were far more important to me than the interior update passive entry A TRUNK BUTTON dual exhaust standard etc..I drove a  Charger as a possible replacement but the ride wasnt great and at the price point for what I wanted it wasnt worth it to me. Totaling it actually was good because I was looking to sell it and wasnt going to get anywhere close to what the insurance company ended up valuing it at due to my modifications but not because it was unreliable like you seem to believe. I heard over and over about Dodge being unreliable yet mine was the most reliable vehicle in my family even with my abuse.,cars,df0pqdj,2,t5_2qhl2

For me the bike was always the cheaper option. The only car I could insure was some L shitbox and it was still k for that. I said fuck it bought a bike and just drive my mas car when I need it. The bike is also infinitely more practical for me. Commuting to uni every day is impossible in a car. It would take  times as long and parking just doesnt exist.

On the bike I zip down the bus lane and park outside the front door of my lecture hall. Ill admit the rain isnt fun but I only usually mind if I get wet on my way out. If I get wet coming home its no big deal. Ive now commuted every day for coming up on  years and I can seriously count on one hand the number of times Ive gotten wet on the way to uni.

11333144,0,t3_61kuhm,I actually blew the original engine in my GT When I was a . I did actually go to college to work on cars but after  year of a  year program did not continue. The second year wouldve been Engine Transmission Electrical and odds and things that can be quickly gone over. I got stuck in snow near Dubuque  Iowa  and while this was very common because GTs Fwd SL not VRs or at least mine is a crippled heavy death trap on snow and Ice. Usually it required a little help from a friend to get me out but this time it slid down a hill on the brakes at a few miles per hour tried to take it as slow as possible shouldnt have tried it at all I had to be towed out above the axles into the snow. I was looking for it to have radiator or cooling issues as at the bottom it had picked up some speed and made a decent front impact into a frozen snowbank. Over the course of the next  days the car ran completely normal all gauges fine no lights on. I though I got lucky and got away with it as I didnt even have cosmetic damage to the bumper etc. however I had my plastic under guard off for weight saving stupid idea I know but they are really heavy cars and I was doing what I could Ive had it back on for daily use since because of that it managed to yank a radiator hose on something not off completely but enough to leak. Over the course of those  days I leaked out all my coolant but it seems it was only when under pressure or something as there was never any below the car after being parked I check for that stuff all the time for any fluids. Well it also turns out BOTH my temp gauge and coolant level sensor were bad! Because no lights ever came on and the temp gauge never showed it overheating. I went to leave work one night and it had already let go of a cylinder. I limped the car home as I lived only about a mile and a half from where I worked on deserted small town back roads. I fully intended to see if I could limp the car to my girlfriends in the morning then to a shop a total of about  miles. I had to go take her to school as her moms car wasnt running at the time and mom had taken hers. Well when I got on the road it had let go of  more cylinders at least because just trying to do decent highway speeds I had to have it floored at  rpm in th in order to obtain  Mph. I was saying PLEASE BABY JUST MAKE IT  MILES miraculously it made it to her school and ALMOST to the shop  of those  miles.  of which were at  rpm before it just shut off like someone had turned the key. This was from blowing the head gasket and frying the whole thing which was bone dry on coolant. No warning light ever came on and the temp gage only ever red a hair above the normal ideal spot well within the operating range.  To make the ending short I had a shop I trust put in another of the exact same engine from another SL dad helped pay for it and said no Vr engine hes not a fan of fast cars I also told them I never wanted anything like this to happen again and to replace every gauge but the tach and speedometer and fuel and every sensor to the respective gauges and warning lights.  ish and SIX WEEKS later not happy about how long it took didnt have a loaner or anything to use it was good as new but my dad was PISSED as he bought me the car for  I paid him back for what he covered of that eventually though. Its doing great still today and the only major problem since has been needing new plugs and wires. ,cars,dfglc0r,1,t5_2qhl2

You also have the issue of having almost all the weight up front and packaging an engine transmission and suspension between the fenders causes compromises. In the end you usually end up with a car that either understeers or has snap oversteer problems with limited steering lock. The only environment where people are faster in FWD than RWD with equal cars is dirt and I honestly dont know as much about that as pavement but I am sure the significantly lower grip plays a major role as all the forces are going to be smaller. ,cars,dflt8v5,2,t5_2qhl2

11392374,0,t3_62fnii,At the time I was extremely pissed but now I think its sort of funny.Before a car photoshoot with a buddy I stopped at a gas station in an unfamiliar part of town. Pulled out going one way wanting to turn around so I went down a side street in the projects. I honestly didnt see the one way sign and there was a cop there watching the intersection. Boom lights on me in  seconds.All is going normal but then he asks if Im on anything. Keep in mind its like pm so its not midnight when most people are drinking. I tell him no. He immediately says Im lying and need to step out of the car. Even at this point I still dont get it because I dont do drugs and hadnt had a drink in at least a week.Cop starts getting angry and threatens me and says hes going to find out what Im on if it takes a blood test. I say sure you can test me Im really not on anything. K unit shows up as well as  more patrol cars. He asks if he can search the vehicle. Honestly knowing my rights I was going to say No you cant and let the K unit sniff it out... but since I was in a car that literally had NOTHING to even search through in it super clean from the photoshoot inside and out I told him to go for it. He rips through the car tossing out the floor mats all doors open everything. Cant find anything.Comes back and says he knows Im still lying and Im probably on some pills. The K guys and other officers are looking at this guy like hes nuts. He then says Get the fuck out of here and I dont want to see you again. So I left.At the time I was a bit shaken up about it but afterwards I realized I got out of a ticket I really deserved for going down the one way.,cars,dfnb4uf,3,t5_2qhl2

11424624,0,t1_dfpvhuh,Personally I only recommend the Charger or Challenger when folks can afford the SRT models. The Chevy SS starts well over k. And the Impala doesnt offer a V.So were left with the Chrysler  which is a big comfortable and fairly fun sedan for someone who wants something nicer with a big engine without paying an arm and a leg. I recommend going with the S with the Hemi V and paying the extra  for performance tires rather than allseason. That will keep you under k even including taxes and fees itll be very fun to drive with the sport suspension and itll be comfortable and spacious to say the least.,cars,dfqyx43,3,t5_2qhl2

Wastes time for which the salesperson does not get paid and puts wear on the merchandise. However most people are usually not willing to sit through a negotiation process run a credit check and then get  lesson.The other issue is that when you are that much of a noob stick driver it will be hard to discern much about how the car drives. So we might take out an automatic version of the same vehicle so the buyer could get a feel for the rest. Or lacking such a vehicle I drive them on the test drive route with the car in question performing whatever tests they wanted me to demonstrate. This would also show how easy or hard it was to drive said vehicle. Id usually offer a follow up lesson with appnt of course to address any lingering questions.Its a leap of faith but barring getting lessons in advance at a driving school or from someone else Im not sure how to do it.

If you buy a car that only has  units out there total and was utterly forgotten then yeah youre probably not going to find the parts you need to keep your car going. Porsche has an extensive classic car parts catalog for most of their models.Ive been reading too much about keeping Skyline GTRs on the road and there are some pretty nontrivial support efforts.

11471235,0,t1_dfvuwnd,Hello. I can recommend any off the shelf Meguiars wax except cleaner wax because it doesnt appear as if you need any. Turtle wax products are generally garbage and inferior to practically every other product on the shelf.So Id recommend paste wax it is very easy to apply and remove. Id recommend Meguiars Gold Class Carnauba Plus wax lasts about a month easy onoff warm carnauba shine nice smell and Meguiars Ultimate Paste Wax which is actually a sealant but dont worry about that. It goes on and off just like a normal paste wax does very easily just dont lay it on thick. It lasts about  months if you only do one coat but Meguiars recommends  coats with the second coat being applied about  hours from the first iirc on the time. It provides a very wet gloss look. For you Id recommend getting the Meguiars ultimate wax. If you desire more durability and protection buy the gold class and top the ultimate wax with a layer of the gold class wax. This will give the Ultimate wax a sacrificial layer of protection so that the ultimate wax lasts longer.,cars,dfw9c0h,2,t5_2qhl2

I didnt want to have to worry about whats in store for me if I took the used gamble so I went for the warranty and will probably be extending it to k miles in two or three years.I understand that the newer models fixed the issues that plagued the  models turbos needing to be replaced etc and Ive seen owners on the  forums with newer models going k miles strong with no issues.I just wanted the peace of mind with the warranty so thats why I went new. I know Ill take a huge depreciation hit but I dont really mind.I will warn you that the interior build quality isnt the greatest and the emblemsside skirts are prone to degrading over time.

I helped them out but man they towed the car back to my house because they wouldnt repair it before getting it inspected by an agent. And I had to stay up until AM last night because towing company had a trouble finding the vehicle amp getting the vehicle out. I had to be involved the whole time. So be aware that it wont be as simple as renting the car out getting it back maintain repeat.Instead of a notice regarding agent being sent I got emails about the situations and a warning that if the tires are worn they will be covered out my pocket. I am certain my car was in a great condition so I am not too worried about that but they left the guest and me hanging right now. I just filed the damage claim and there is no real way to get hold of a real person.

11665295,0,t1_dgh2mtm,Actually the Ghiblis interior is strikingly similar to the interior in my  Charger RT AWD Max I also own a Hellcat Charger and that interior is close but not quite so on the nose... want to know the kicker? The Max package in  included many of the features that were bafflingly absent in the Ghibli... They also seemed to have gone with the worst of the Uconnect interfaces. I can turn on the heatedcooled seats and heated steering wheel within the first  or so seconds of starting the car the splash screen has these buttons at the bottom and if theres no submenu on the .N RB system it also has no issue working with an iPhone ... I wonder what version theyre using here because its close but slightly... worse. My  Grand Cherokees Uconnect plays very well with the iPhone and even comes with a built in spotify app you can either pay for monthly data for the car or just use your phone as a data connection. Hell my Charger even addresses the maplight issue you brought up. Its the exact same outside shape for the light but it includes two push style lights which give a more broad light and the two smaller focused lights that are button activated. So my  Charger offers engine power levels not terribly far off the Maserati hplbft out of an engine thats likely far cheaper to maintain Italian forced induction engine vs. NA V American engine. I also have MORE features... and the interior matches a cheaper sports sedan. Wanna know the real kicker? You mention that it shares buttonsswitchesinfotainment from cheaper FCA vehicles but the platform is actually a derivative of the LX platform Charger Challenger  it may not share  of the platform but its VERY close to the LX but hey its made in Italy so theres that.In my eyes its a fn  C except the  has better options and if you step up to the SRT it will also have a good bit more HP and torque.... and still be cheaper.

11698395,0,t3_66x770,gtA small engine such as a V uses a lot of fuel when driving in the city but less on long drives on the motorway. A bigger engine such as a V uses less in the city but more on the motorway.Im not sure thats quite correct. Given the same car an I will generally be more efficient in the city than a V since it doesnt need to be particularly stressed at low speeds so the smaller displacement will be beneficial. Your analogy isnt quite accurate unless you drive like the accelerator is an onoff switch. On the motorway however an I is stressed more than a V and will likely be running at higher revs hence using more fuel. This is how Top Gear managed to make an M get better mpg than a Prius they ran them both at a speed where the Prius was at its most inefficient whereas the V of the M was fine driving at a constant mph. ,cars,dgm15c0,5,t5_2qhl2

You can still get that sensation of driving in a bunker with a Camaro but you can also enjoy corners. The Challenger is the biggest and yet does the worst in crash safety. The Camaro has trims that are almost as quick as the Hellcat but the Challenger doesnt have any trims that can compete around a road course with something like a Z. Plus for a muscle car it looks too stilted and needs less wheel and fatter sidewall. For the price there are better GT cars too. The Demon is the exception because it is a purpose built car.

The only mod that would affect the driveability would be the suspension but that depends on what you get and how its set up. If you are going the modding route I would recommend going to autocross or a track day to learn the car before you decide whether or not you need new suspension chances are the answer will be no from a performance standpoint.However if youre trying to make the car be as fun to drive and as good handling as a purpose built sports car like the S its not going to happen theres a big difference between a modded hot hatch and a sports car. ,cars,dgqdc9u,1,t5_2qhl2

And to get the permit you just have to pass a multiple choice test You are also allowed to drive on private property without a license like parking lots so people will practice there.The price is great and part of the reason licenses are so cheapeasy to get in the US is because our country is so big and a lot of people dont live in places with access to public transport that many wouldnt be able to survive without a car. ,cars,dguolfp,11,t5_2qhl2
