490204,0,t1_cfvraea,Thank you for your words!  You should definitely write one.  Theres this pervasive misconception that lucky richbeautifullovedetc people cant also be hurting badly or that their experiences of pain are somehow invalid.  I think thats whats behind feelbetter and totally unhelpful phrases like Cheer up tons of people have it worse than you.Even if you decide not to post here I would love to read what you have to say.,lifeinapost,cfvzmxg,3,t5_2x3p8
1624777,0,t1_cjjy75h,Well Im not a doctor but from what Ive understood. Depression can cause some hormonal disturbances but they could just as well have made you taller. I dont think it affected much.. Yes growth hormone and testosterone are created when you sleep so it most likely affected your height. I wouldnt expect a teenager to understand all of that though and of course neither you nor your parents knew how tall you would end up becoming.. Yes eating badly when growing up can certainly affect your height. . Thats relatively late to start very far from what people would call excessive and Ive never heard of anyone saying it would stunt growth.. This is what I learned as well but it seems like science has changed its mind on this except in very extreme cases. A few sit ups and push ups should make no difference.. Dont know enough about this one.In the end hindsight is  and you dont know how tall you would have been if you had done everything as you now wish you had. It could have been the same height or a foot taller we will never know. The biggest influence was probably bad sleep and you having problem with insomnia really isnt your fault or anything you can do much about.,lifeinapost,cjjyvqu,0,t5_2x3p8
