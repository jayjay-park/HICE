4370546,0,t1_csi9w21,This is all I can find right nowThen there was the matter of the Tariff of Abominations which became abominable for all concerned.This inflammatory piece of legislation passed with the aid of Northern politicians imposed a tax or duty on imported goods that caused practically everything purchased in the South to rise nearly halfagain in price. This was because the South had become used to shipping its cotton to England and France and in return receiving boatloads of inexpensive European goods including clothing made from its own cotton. However as years went by the North particularly New England had developed cotton mills of its ownas well as leather and harness manufactories iron and steel mills arms and munitions factories potteries furniture makers silversmiths and so forth. And with the new tariff putting foreign goods out of financial reach Southerners were forced to buy these products from the North at what they considered exorbitant costs.Smart money might have concluded it would be wise for the South to build its own cotton mills and its own manufactories but its people were too attached to growing cotton. A visitor in the s described the relentless cycle of the planters misallocation of spare capital To sell cotton to buy Negroesto make more cotton to buy more Negroesad infinitum.Such was the Southern mindset but the tariff nearly kicked off the war  years early because as the furor rose South Carolinas Calhoun who was then running for vice president of the United States declared that stateshis own state in particularwere under no obligation to obey the federal tariff law or to collect it from ships entering its harbors. Later South Carolina legislators acted on this assertion and defied the federal government to overrule them lest the state secede. This set off the Nullification Crisis which held in theory or wishful thinking that a state could nullify or ignore any federal law it held was not in its best interests. The crisis was defused only when President Andrew Jackson sent warships into Charleston Harborbut it also marked the first time a Southern state had threatened to secede from the Union.The incident also set the stage for the states rights dispute pitting state laws against the notion of federal sovereigntyan argument which became ongoing into the next century and the next. States rights also became a Southern watchword for Northern or Yankee intrusion on the Southern lifestyle. States rights political parties sprang up over the South one particular example of just how volatile the issue had become was embodied in the decision in  of Nathaniel and Elizabeth Gist ironically from Union S.C. to name their firstborn son States Rights Gist a name he bore proudly until November   when as a Confederate brigadier general he was shot and killed leading his men at the Battle of Franklin in Tennessee.Though the tariff question remained an open sore from its inception in  right up to the Civil War many modern historians have dismissed the impact it had on the growing rift between the two sections of the country. But any careful reading of newspapers magazines or correspondence of the era indicates that here is where the feud began to fester into hatred. Some Southern historians in the past have argued this was the root cause of the Civil War. It wasnt but it was a critical ingredient in the suspicion and mistrust Southerners were beginning to feel about their Northern brethren and by extension about the Union itself. Not only did the tariff issue raise for the first time the frightening specter of Southern secession but it also seemed to have marked a mazy kind of dividing line in which the South vaguely started thinking of itself as a separate entityperhaps even a separate country. Thus the cat or at least the cats paw was out of the bag.Source ,starterpacks,csianj0,0,t5_34o9s

6036651,0,t1_csnu90q,Actually its a well hidden secret at fox news.  After the successful cloning of Dolly the Sheep in  Fox decided to see if cloned humans could be detected on national television.  The project was codenamed Factor.However days before they were to reveal this experiment in  the Bill Clinton administration banned all human cloning experiments.  This meant that Fox News couldnt dispose of the clones without arousing police suspicion.This meant that Factor could only wait until the death of the clones predicted to be in .  This meant that from  to  Factor was simply a faade to an experiment of human cloning.  Their idea was that if their ideology was crazy enough nobody would pay attention to Factor. However in the wake of the  terrorist attacks many people actually turned over to Fox News as a legitimate news source.  This came to the huge surprise of Fox Corporation who had essentially let Factor run on autopilot for five years. This time Project Factor had really taken off.However all of the clones had died in  as expected.  This time technology has improved.  The clones can survive an indefinite amount of time.  This time they had made two sets of clones.  One was for mainstream media these were quirky brunettes that had infectious smiles.  Another one was for project Factor these were stern blondes with a strong feminine aura.  These are the Fox News ladies you know today.,starterpacks,cyax2jq,3,t5_34o9s

6987940,0,t1_d18e5i9,Not different standards its different costs of living. MO is actually below the average cost of living index of the US. That listing may be only  a month but houses on my street i live in Redlands CA have multiple immigrant families living in them because they cannot afford to rent or buy their own places. These are being listed at around  a month. I have literally seen one car garages where full families live. They probably pay  per family per month.  Its not a matter of standards at all. If it was as easy as moving to an area where standards of living are different then it wouldnt be an issue. The poorest people already live in the worst conditions. Many people who argue your point would HATE having low income families living in their areas because it would devalue property among other things. The fact that you can find a cheap listing close by with good amenities doesnt show that a person can make it on a shitty hourly wage. Working minimum wage for  hours a week in your state would be enough to live out of that apartment. But you are only supposed to spend about  of your money on rent more like  when youre on low income. SOOOOOOOOOO think of how many more hours that person is gonna have to pick up to cover the rest of their expenses. Plus imagine having a family. More hours spent earning money means less hours being a parent. No parenting  bad situation and likely means that the children are more likely to end up in a hole. I also found that a majority of these listings are incredibly isolated and the closest  entry levelminimum wage paying positions are few and far between. So transportation to and from work would be an issue plus picking up kids from school etc. Plus where do you get your food? Its quite a drive to a grocery store based off of the listing I have found on zillow that is identical except it has  bedroom. Driving long distances on low income pay is not economical. There are a zillion reasons that low rent doesnt guarantee an easy life for a low income person or family. ,starterpacks,d18fa29,1,t5_34o9s

7414314,1,t1_d2kvqaz,Or you can act like an adult and explain what was wrong instead of saying wow what a retard  like thats some sort of proper rebuttal. I stand by what i said though. umissxhiel covered everything wrong with Ray quite well but that leaves Finn whos great for a one off character. Absolutely fantastic covers what he needs to. If they retired him save for a few cameos maybe gave him a cushier position Id be fine with that. But you know as well as I do theyll make him stay a main character who gets into the heat of battle. Why? What separates him from the hundreds of other trained soldiers the rebels have? You cant say well hes got training as an imperial trooper he knows their facilities! Cause he admit he only knew the layout of the death star analogue because he was literally the janitor there. He doesnt have connections he has the same basic military training as others hes shown no other skills except from having fantastic cardio from running away from everything and the ability to flail a lightsaber somewhat competently. So unless theyre gonna let him keep using the lightsaber to stand out from others hes got no reason to continue being a sort of in the fray character in the series. Was he a bad character? No. In fact I quite liked him. Was he useless? Hell no he did a lot to help drive the plot and help da gud gais. Hes like and I hate to say it Jarjar. He came in did the thing was incredibly useful for what good he did do then he was appointed to a nice cozy position and though he was off screen he was still relevant.

My first two pregnancies I wasnt very sick at all so to have a completely different experience I assumed there must be two babies in there. Once I found out there was in fact only  baby I began to think it was a girl. I was slightly more sick with Laikynn and I have heard that you experience more morning sickness with a girl. So then I was convinced I was having a girl. Funny story I was convinced my first was a girl and my second was a boy.. so obviously I am really good at guessing the gender of my babies HA! Before we found out the gender I decided to plan a cute little gender reveal photo shoot with cupcakes and tulle skirts because I was so convinced it was a girl. Well turns out baby is a boy and so we didnt get the chance to wear these darling skirts for the gender reveal. However they are SO cute that we will just wear them all summer long to parties and wedding!

They let it dry for a bit so you can get the same dampness as with spray but without hair productsgrease. gtNo one likes your dumb ass coming in and trying to explain what you wantThen youve been going to the barber wrong. Thats the point of a barber. Listening to what you want is his job. He cant make out every detail how you want your hair from a photo. People have different hair and the barber cant know how your hair behaves. Telling him what to look out for gives you a better hairstyle. You alone know what works best for your style. If you dont care and just take the standard cut it wont take long.You wont ask him to fix it for an hour but if you dont like what hes done even if you showed him exactly what you wanted you can ask him to change it. Again thats his job. Thats the reason you pay him.If you always get simple hairstyles without styling needs it wont take long. I cant deny that if you find an awesome barber he can do it in under  min but why even bother? The barber that needs more time wont give you a worse hairstyle probably a better one and I dont care about the time. ,starterpacks,d9xs7px,10,t5_34o9s

9611678,0,t1_d9xsm0p,If your cut takes only  min you cant judge people that get styles that just take longer to make. Its impossible or not good to rush a more complicated cut. You look at the product before they style it. Then you can take inspiration from how the barber does it. It depends on the barber if they get what you want. You have to tell them exactly how you want it and know yourself what you want and a good barber can make that happen. Really good barbers will even fit the style to your head but you can help them with input. Cheap haircuts are  here.  are the better ones but you still gotta find out yourself. Most barbers will just wash your hair its already in the price. Some even give you a free drink. Most better barbers have appointments and plan for  min.Most of the cheap ones have barbers that dont care about you. Just wage slaves trying to survive. If you show them a picture they will make you that cut but it wont necessarily look good. And like I said earlier in my country its impossible to run a business at  a cut. Btw I think an undercut jewfro is the best cut for curly hair. ,starterpacks,d9xu3z5,8,t5_34o9s

I doubt it.The rate at which carbon is being removed from sinks and put into the atmosphere is probably unprecedented in earths history.  Changes in declination earths tilt orbit and solar activity have caused warming and cooling trends. Shit large volcanic eruptions have probably caused ice ages. Humans dont influence these factors. But the content of our atmosphere and its ability to absorb energy is influenced by humans and our behavior. The large rise in temperatures following the industrial revolution should alarming to everyone. Even if we human caused climate change is not really a factor we will have to stop relying on fossil fuels anyway.

MLK was the unifier he mostly appealed to white folks by trying to make the black civil rights movement seem less militant than it actually was. He was essentially the only civil rights leader at the time which white people thought wasnt so bad. He was essentially the barrier between black militarism and the white population. Its not as if he wasnt hated by the right wing but he was liked far more than say Malcolm X. When he was killed all that peace and love shit was thrown out the window and riots broke out in dozens of american cities like we had never seen before. So its not exactly a wonder why TD loves MLK. MLK was considered by much of the black nationalist groups to be somewhat of an uncle tom and he likely would be considered one today as well. Thats not to say he wasnt well loved by black people he WAS adored by them but again he wasnt nearly as fervent and militant as other groups hence why white people liked him too. ,starterpacks,dan8vi7,-9,t5_34o9s

9943491,0,t1_db37ey5,Short history lesson in American politicsFor ages politics in the US were mostly dominated by Liberals. The main difference between the two main political parties wasnt a disagreement on Liberalism but on the role of the federal government vs. the role of the states essentially Federalism vs. Republicanism ergo Hamiltonian vs. Jeffersonian political world view.Then the s happened and there was a big political upheaval that combined a sudden realignment with social issues into political identity with the takeover of the GOP by evangelical Christians. This led to the GOP rebranding itself as a Conservative party and over time led to the elimination of Liberal Republicans from the party an on point example of this would be that Hillary Clinton was a Republican and Goldwater supporter around this time. People living now might find it hard to imagine but prior to this time period the United States never had a real Conservative party. Thats just how it was but it makes sense considering the relative lack of age of the Republic. Its hard to be conservative about established traditions and institutions when theyve only been around for a generation or two. Im sure there were people who tried but the zeitgeist of political sentiment wasnt there until the massive social upheaval in the th century.Anyway the last few decades since that time has been spent labeling the Democrat party as Liberals like its a dirty word in an attempt to make the distinction between the Old GOP and the New Conservative GOP clear. Thats mostly died down in the last couple of decades or so as people have come to accept that this is the case.Anyway the net result of this is that the term Liberal has gone from being a political philosophy to short hand for a particular political party affiliation. Thats why you see Americans mostly making distinctions like Classical Liberal which is to say I believe in Liberalism but I may or may not be a member of X party. Now the problem here is that Classicial Liberalsim often refers to a specific branch of Liberalism that promotes laissezfaire economics and is closely identified with the US Libertarian party. Its troublesome because what a lot of people really want to say is something along the lines of Im not a Democrat Im a Liberal but it often comes out as Classical Liberal without understanding the former connotation.But of course before all this the term Liberal was much more widely used as a descriptor of political inclination. For instance George H.W. Bush was often described as a Liberal Republican and his father Prescott was a well known Liberal Republican Senator from Connecticut till the s when everything started to change. Anyway itd probably be more accurate to say that the GOP and the Dems are actually NeoConservatives and NeoLiberals because both parties essentially support the government welfare state just in different and sometimes the same see pork barrel military spending ways. The Libertarian party is as far as I know definitely a Classical Liberal party that supports laissezfaire economics and a lot of people out there are struggling with the concept that they may self identify as a Liberal but that doesnt neatly put them into one of the available political party affiliation boxes.I sorta fall into that category. I am a registered Democrat and have been for  years but the party is not a really good fit for my beliefs as a Liberal these days. The Libertarian party is probably closer but thats not really because my beliefs have moved simply its a side effect of the Democrats evolving into a party more focused on identity politics while enabling corporate cronyism bread and circuses basically.,starterpacks,db3nt4u,6,t5_34o9s

That and its faster to type. Also I always have them with me they dont take up space in my backpack or room I have a lot of books already both narrative and school I have an ebook copy of most but I still read a ton of paperbacks even though I own a Kindle which is such a good thing for a tidiness nerd such as myself. By the way there are some subjects where you MUST use paper. Really I say it from the bottom of my heart if you use a PC to do maths you are putting yourself through so much unnecessary effort. The effort is to buy a graphics tablet yeah but thats like admitting paper is better for that sort of thing. Be a normal person and use paper when you must!Also taking notes on a computer is really not for everyone. It requires a lot of training to get fast at typing on a keyboard and youre left with writing purely text notes maybe use bullet lists. When you take notes on paper youre free to do it your way. The pen you want. Draw what you want. Mindmap what you want without having to open XMind. Write in columns. Do whatever the hell you want. I absolutely take paper notes in biology because its just that liberating!,starterpacks,dcmm0ug,2,t5_34o9s

10564526,0,t1_dd5j9x4,Your argument is not strong there is a difference between going to church to keep your parents happy and minor getting kicked out of their houses for even contemplating that god does not exist. But the gist of what I am going for is nongolfers dont generally get discriminated against and having a place to talk openly and honestly about it is healthy and cathartic.From my experience fanatic atheist are generally a group of ex fanatical thiest their fanaticism comes from treating nonreligion the way the treated religion. While annoying they tend to grow out of it the longer they are away from the church and through open and honest discussions with other atheists which is something a place such as ratheism can foster.  ,starterpacks,dd5lx1e,2,t5_34o9s

10584453,0,t1_dd7llym,I know comrade just trying to act humble to attract normies to the idea. I am very optimistic towards calans ideas. For some reason one never reads about his ideology in the mainstream press much like no westerns papers were correctly describing revolutionary Catalonia back in the day. One problem with Catalonia was that it was caught between two versions of statist ideology that both saw Catalonia as a threat to their power. With Rojava there is no Stalinism to crush it from within. Al though the arab cold war imperialism poses great problems for the region.PRwise democratic confederalism is also very good because it presents revolutionary ideas in a framework of promoting extreme democracy instead of promoting violent revolution and a dictatorship of the proletariat. Democratic confederalism really seems to me like the a somewhat realistic solution to the SyrianIraqi civil war. No stable states are going to emerge from the rubbles of that war unless they are totalitarian. The ideals of Rojava should somehow be spread to other parts of the region and not just be a Kurdish thing. When if the Islamic state collapses wouldnt this ideology be appealing for those left? Better than to be dominated by Iranians or Saudis at least.I really think that leftist political energy should go into promoting this idea even if its possibly not viable in the west. The ideas of self governance could be very appealing to the masses in Europe if the EU collapses as many respected analysts think. Not necessarily creating a utopia but promoting decentralized version of democracy where worker control is reestablished. I dont believe the ideologies of nationalism can be successful in the long run.As liberal market orientated internationalism fails the alternative could simply be liberal worker orientated communalism.I might be tripping here. But we are at a cross roads in history. The left needs some viable alternative to the status quo that is more humane than Bolshevism. We have a unique opportunity to reshape the world that hasnt existed in a very long time.,starterpacks,dd7pdvj,5,t5_34o9s

From previously legally segregated neighborhoods that are still virtually segregated to the differences in police reactions from a White suspect and a Black suspect systematic racism exists.

As a result they broke up jobs into segments for different people therefore artificially creating jobs. Its not real job creation. Then you have to take a look at the amount of debt Obama put us in to accomplish those goals. Meanwhile trump has made actual deals with companies and manufacturing across the world to bring real production back to America while reducing the deficitAnd your right jobs and the stock market dont increase just because a president changes but it just so happens that we have a president who is an expert at wealth and job creation. Obviously he will have an impact in those fields.Speaking of the wall illegal immigration has already dropped dramatically as there is less incentives for them to do so. The amount of money we lose to illegal immigration easily justifies the price of the wall even if he doesnt make Mexico pay for it he willYoull have to reference specifics about healthcare and environment for a discussion .And smart spending in the military actually would save lifes. Instead of more tanks that money could go toward training equipment aid construction etc. a hurricane tears up a state and the national guard comes in  thats military and it saves lives. the military functions in many different capacities other than KILL.For the wall illegals hold no documents are harder to track and manage and by that virtue can commit crimes easier and more freely. They often get sent back when they commit crimes just to cross again. Of course the wall will save lifes.Walls work. You have cell walls to hold your cells together.

My female cousin who pursues casual sex frequently? Does that prove anything overall? No. That is anecdotal experience and very limited in scope.Once again actual scientific study amp surveys have been done. Women are into sex too. Quite a bit in fact. Maybe not as much as men but quite a bit more than people tend to think.gtBut I also read that women dont have as high of a sex drive as men on averageWomens sex drive is dependent on a number of factors differs widely from person to person and changes with age. It increases and decreases at various points in their life due to changes in hormone production. It may be slightly less than mens as a whole if you aggregate men and women together but its not a huge divide. Studies have shown that men underestimate their partners sex drive regularly  According to data that has actually been gathered the notion that men want sex all the time and women dont is a sexist denigration of women and men alike.

I said in another comment that I want to also do some machine learning for categorization either seperating by genre or along electronicinstrumental lines but Ill have to work on a way to get a large enough data set for training. Plus Im pretty amateur with machine learning. I have a ton of music in my library but for training data it would be best if each song was a  fit for the category. As in a song would need to be either  instrumental or  electronic.I dont know how significant any findings could actually be since theres a ton of subiectivity involved but its been a pet theory of mine long enough that I wanted to finally put it to the test.,starterpacks,dfefjl2,1,t5_34o9s

It is like my hips are in a sharp V and I have not been suspending my weight in twisting and locking my body. I have never really come to know the natural structure of my physical body until now. Drive the weight down to the contacts correctly if youre sitting dont sit on your tail bone and curl if your standing four corners of the feet dont lock the joints!!!. Its driving as much weight into the base of your posture while also melting as many muscles as you can. Im not sure if you are familiar with nonNewtonian fluid but there is a large aspect of that in your bodies Synovial fluid So driving the weight down while melting the body seems to be relaxing as many muscles as possible to take tension of the spine so this non Newtonian fluid can act as a liquid and your joints can align. Coincidentally I think this is a large aspect of why breathing is really effective. Stretching and relaxing all the little tiny intercostal muscles. Running for posture will really help clear the head! focus on where its tense and how youre landing on your foot rolling your weight over the outer edge curling the foot is very common. Dont stress yourself with weight or fitness goals just run to get tension out. This practice is my rock.,starterpacks,dgi585s,1,t5_34o9s

My point is that in general drug criminalization enjoys rare bipartisan support.Id take any candidate seriously republican or democrat when they talk about doing away with all drug scheduling and admit that a ridiculous amount of money was wasted with little to no results.  Drug scheduling is like an ongoing Iraq war.  So much money no reward!,starterpacks,dgoybit,2,t5_34o9s

11726716,0,t1_dgp7akd,Yes they may not ban the comments but they do keep the opposing content off of their subreddit also the way reddit works with the upvoting system downvoted comments become hidden from the casual browser making it into an echo chamber of its own. Not realizing the biases of the places you spend your time is harmful no matter what side you are on you should try to constantly find subreddits less biased like rPoliticalDiscussion. We have to stop thinking so much about our side or responding with emotion. Objective discussion while listening with open minds is key  we are so polarized now that we believe the other side is evil and that open mindedness is an inherent trait of our side instead of actually being open minded. Honestly all the threads like these and the divisive comments are a really disheartening look into our future political system. ,starterpacks,dgp958j,2,t5_34o9s

11731030,0,t1_dgpp8gu,First off that picture isnt a fake. Its very real. A child died. The photos were taken by Turkish journalist Nilfer Demir. Secondly Richard Spencer first used the term altright to describe his political philosophy as far back as . That would be a full  years before the death of Alan Kurdi or that fake idiot kid as you call him. So a couple things here if youre going to spout of stupid stuff at least make sure youre putting at least one fact in there to try to make it somewhat plausible. Also just because you may not like what an image shows or the fact that it changed peoples mind on a topic does not make it fake. Also I find it hypocritical that your trying to make a strawman argument out of this so that you can forgive the absolutely horrible things said about a dead child by a group you align yourself with in some of your previous comments. But then again you have said yourself you dont mind pulling from the fascist playbook.,starterpacks,dgpqqy6,1,t5_34o9s

If it wasnt widely used by white supremacists it most likely wouldnt have the negative connotation it does today hence why it was ruined by conservatives.The term propaganda was ruined partially due to the excess accusations but also partly due to its incredibly vague definition to begin with.,starterpacks,dgpvlin,4,t5_34o9s
