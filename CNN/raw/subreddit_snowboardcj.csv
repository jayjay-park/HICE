9687113,0,t1_da74f7v,NO! It disappoints me how snowboarders set up a bad example for everybody else by not wearing a helmet for every occasion. You should only take your helmet off when you go to bed but Im a big proponent of safety and leave mine on at all times. I dont want to get a concussion if I roll off my bed. Im doing my part to keep everybody out there safe!,snowboardcj,da754ca,2,t5_2wrbm
