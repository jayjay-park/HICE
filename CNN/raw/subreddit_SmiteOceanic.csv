3303430,0,t1_cp4t9yy,Its hard to give a straight answer when no one listens? Going about Reddit about it the way everyone is going how is that questions people never give feedback straight to a admin if you give admin straight to a cybergamer admin by pming them or contacting in other ways then its alot easier for the admin to be able to deal with the issue. How am I ment to know how to answer things I get blamed for if I havent been here to be able to even know the issues. But Other Cybergamer admins work there hardest to insure we can fix as many issues as they can this is all volunteer work remember that. ,SmiteOceanic,cp4tg04,0,t5_3451h

6131386,0,t1_cymaie9,Thanks man as much as I sometimes want to try and talk myself out of being a jungler. I always see myself falling back into that position for those exact reasons you said above it is what I do best and I think that reading this has already made me realize that the jungle position is what I should really be looking for.
