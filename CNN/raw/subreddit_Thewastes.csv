4478735,0,t1_csv7kms,Yeah I have had pretty unlucky encounters myself! I started a new character just now ran into a  health Devil. Another one for the graveyard... I feel like the enemies encountered should scale with the character level but at the same time the random difficulty makes it unpredictable and fun!,Thewastes,csv7ohg,2,t5_2xp5w
4507455,0,t1_csyslps,Yeah I noticed there was some confusion on what it does its actually pretty useful if you want to level quickly especially when you hit level  and get an extra perk point per level,Thewastes,csytcak,2,t5_2xp5w
4522008,0,t1_ct0ln0m,Absolutely Ive come across hundreds in this game the problem is with so many things interacting and so much randomness there is great opportunity for bugs to thrive if things dont fit perfectly!,Thewastes,ct0n1ju,2,t5_2xp5w
4549399,0,t1_ct42giu,No problem.  Theyre still the leading place on the Internet to find blind people who want to play games at the moment so thats why I sent you that way.  ,Thewastes,ct42qaf,2,t5_2xp5w
