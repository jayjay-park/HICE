Itll make some difference in which improv skills you develop first but ultimately if youre going to actually get good at this youre looking at a path of several years and taking classes or workshops from a wide range of theatersschools. e.g. Ive never taken a single UCB class but over the years Ive taken tons of UCB workshops and thats done the job nicely as far getting the approach to scenes and gamecentric improv when I want to play that way.

Not because we did great scenes though. Though a few of the scenes were pretty special high school memories for me. We scored well because we played to the ballot. Essentially my partner and I treated IHSSA improv like a very specific shortform game with certain rules and conditions that needed to be used.Is this conducive to good improv? Not necessarily. In fact Id say that all the improv stuff I learned came not from the IHSSA process but from my experienced coach whod already had a decades worth of onstage experience as an improviser.

3558014,0,t3_310o4p,Ok Im also in college improv troupe and Ive seen a few duos. Theres no trick to making it work. It really comes down to the chemistry of the players and what play style the two of you develop in that PRACTICE a fuckton before you perform.We had two guys that were jacksofalltrades improvisers. They would just go out cold and do killer forms every time usually built on their unique characters and strong sens of Yesamping. They leaned more toward mammuts where characters enteredexitedwent ghost frequently.We had a guy and a girl that were both very emotionbased. They tended to move at a slower pace and let their relationships drive their forms. They typically did mammuts based on their initial two characters. We had two girls that honestly kind of hated each other not at the beginning of their run but toward the end and somehow their equal senses of oneupsmanship pushed them. They typically did freeforms that were split between relational and narrative.Meanwhile my partner and I were in our hayday more like the first pair I mentioned sort of generallyrounded performers with an emphasis on Yesamping. Toward the end we started to get more into montagey type forms but they always ended up being narrative in some sense by the end. ALL OF THAT IS TO SAY...TLDR Throw some spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks. The only two reference forms for duos I can find on our channel are here and hereLastly Ive been in a duo and directed two so Ive got a few ideas about what forms dodont work.

I realize that youre writing this for beginning improvisers but I dont think youre doing them any favors by adding more rules of thumb. Moreover many of the ones youre suggesting dont be in a car no crime scenes etc. arent helpful guidelines and are far too situation focused when the situation is so arbitrary in the success of a scene. ,improv,cs85qge,2,t5_2qwok

5200460,0,t1_cvcu20d,The postSorry this post is so long. This article brought up a lot of feelings for me. A while back I wrote a Facebook status saying that I met the worst people I know in comedy. Why? Because its an art that encourages people to not have filters and say literally whatever they want and it allows people to really spew some vile shit. And Im a strong person but bitchhhhhhh I cant tell you how many times Ive wanted to leave the comedy community because of events such as having instructors encourage me to play stronger black characters because apparently me being quirky and playing non black characters just wasnt believable. having to listen to people bring in pitches where their first line is so a white slave owner comes out in black face and me having to be the asshole because I tell them their parody sketch of Undercover Bosses on a slave plantation is offensive as fuck and also written poorly. being made to feel bad because I was happy other black people were hired for a job that majority white people get. During the only show during my Bs that I invite someone who happens to be a person of color. I had to endure in the first scene of the show a white man initiating the scene by saying ok stand on that chair and put this noose around your neck. Me telling him as your adoptive BLACK son I dont think youre being sensitive to my personal cultural background father. And then having to sit in that bullshit scene for about  mins because the rest of the white players on the side didnt think it was a good idea to edit a scene where the game was trying to convince Dewayne to pretend to be lynched. Also the gasps of my friend in the audience. probably in a few minutes when someone tries to argue with me on this Facebook status and say some AllImprovisersMatter shit or start a bit that belittles everything that Ive said and that somehow derails this whole status to make it conversation about their feelings.I sometimes think I take comedy and improv too serious that Im too business orientated. And I recently stopped to think why and I think its because I have to. If I see it as business Im able to let shit go real quick and move on. ComedyImprov has to be this business slightly impersonal thing because if I loved improv with all my heart the way so many of my white peers love it and move here for it and let it become my life and then get treated the way most POC get treated in this community. I would be fucking crushed and probably leave.So in order to stay active in this community I have to strategically be inactive and impersonal and just do my job.

Even the weirdest thing can be relatable if it taps into basic human needs and emotions. Heres what you do. First make a list of verbsactivities. Jogging hanging a poster painting writing eating pizza... on and on and on.Now draw an axis. On one line write Life at one end and Love at the other. On the other line write Getting more it on the top and Getting rid of it at the bottom. Now every action can be thought of in terms of gaining more or getting rid of Life or Love.Now pick any activity and then randomize choosing a point on the axis. Figure out how that activity leads to you doing what you landed on. For example eating pizza from my list and landing on getting rid of Love. I might be trying to fatten myself up and look so disgusting that it will force my girlfriend to dump me. Now that I have the justification of getting my girl to dump me I have something playable translatable into more actions.

5768011,0,t1_cxc12bn,gt your teacher cant tell if you are pulling premise and purposefully tweaking itgt you should be able to pull a premise perfectly or tweak them depending on what you are going forDont get me wrongI agree with this. It just seemed like it was inconsistent exactly what types of tweaks were allowed. The examples we were given of better ways to pull premise werent always obviously closer to the monologue than the premises that were being poopooed and in one case the instructors example clearly incorporated something that wasnt rooted in the monologue and almost caused a fight between the student whose initiation was being discussed and the instructor. Some of the instructors tweaks were not clearly different than the ones the students were making. And when given the opportunity to explain why someone put a spin on the premise they pulled they were flat out told not to and not from a thats not how we should do it in class perspective totally fine I can live with that but a thats not how UCB pulls premise perspective which was jarring coming from having watched many performances at the theater.I still enjoyed the class but just found some of the more extended premise discussions lacking in clarity as to why the instructors choices were better than ours.,improv,cxc2pob,2,t5_2qwok

And where there is no line there is no performance I knowI know you can do comedy without speaking. But Id argue for our purposes in this discussion a pratfall or a mime routine or whatever is still an idealine. Its kinda like saying What do you think keeps us alive more drinking water or eating food? Id also argue that not every idea is fine. Ive done and taught a lot of scenes. And a lot of the bad ones have been due to performance. But also a lot of bad ones have been because its an uninteresting or unfunny premise. Both obviously factor in but theyre hand in hand I dont have any more interest in watching a show thats bad ideas performed well than I do watching good ideas executed poorly.Also I fully agree with you Speakeasy about nailing numbers down being destructive. In my experience teaching you go down that road and then all of a sudden students who are trying to learn start taking it as fact instead of just general rules of thumb.

One through the door slightly offstage one through a window one remaining onstage as a corpse. One of the actors is also assaulted by the class which would include audience members so finding a way to do that safely might end up being costly depending on how the ink was made. Not to mention all of the props needed for the classroom itself such as textbooks backpacks notebooks etc. since the show opens in a lecture. A high school classroom would likely have most props available but a university classroom would not. Outside the windows you would also ideally have emergency vehicles of some sort visible. at least for a few minutes then replace with lighting effects once the blinds are closed.Lighting in the space would also be expensive relatively for the size of the show due to needing to discretely install practicals and specials.Break even point not counting advertisingsponsorships or paying anybody would necessitate a minimum ticket price in the Twentysomething dollar range at least.

Its easy to go with Look a girl! when you havent really been listening. As far as broprov... My own feeling is being made a mom isnt that bad theres loads of interesting moms in the world and I can work with that. But Im letting the character define their own course not my scene partner. Im there to serve the story not my scene partners idea of what the story needs. I need to push the scene forward yesand the crap out of my partners gifts... but sometimes a yes is a no.

I know it can vary but I dont know of many citiestheaters where house troupes arent expected to rehearse weekly. The only exceptions I can think of is where the theaters dont really have their own house ensembles and so shows and their rehearsal schedules are more up to the individual troupes AustinHideout and HUGEMinneapolis come to mind but even then most of the projects have a lot of prep if theyre going to be good enough to get stage time. ,improv,d4szdsv,1,t5_2qwok

10170822,0,t3_5lkf0w,Here  is a video of dialog coach Erik Singer analyzing accents and dialects in bigpicture films. Its not a definitive guide but he points out a lot of details most of us miss. The most helpful advice Ive gotten as someone whos not great at accents but also not the worst is to focus on the shape and placement of your mouth and understanding the language to at least some degree helps. Broadsweeping examples  Spanish vowels and consonants are generally spoken at the front of the mouth. The vowels A E I O and U are pronounced AH EH EE OH and OO respectively. Say them with your tongue placed against your bottom teeth. Consonants are generally the same as in English except J and G are a strongly aspirated H but they also maintain this sense of forward placement. The consonant R is more like a soft D ha ha and is pronounced with the tongue gently and briefly touching the roof of the mouth right behind the front teeth. The double consonant RR is performed the same way but the tongue trills in the same position. If you can do this easily your mouth placement is probably correct since this is nearly impossible to do with your tongue farther back. The consonant B is more like a soft V oh dear. Because there is no J sound in Spanish some Spanish speakers pronouncing this English consonant will either overemphasize it or treat it more like a ZH. This is just a sample of the Spanish dialect that doesnt even touch on cadence or flow but I hope this gives you an idea of how Spanish speakers tend to pronounce their words. Im not a native Spanish speaker myself so if Im incorrect here please correct me. French however is largely placed further back in the mouth. I dont know the language as well but just take the word for Hello which is Bonjour. The B is the same as in English the following ON is pronounced more like Ohn with a soft elided N. The last syllable Jour is pronounced Zhuhr with the consonant R placed so far back towards the throat that an English speaker would hardly consider it an R at all. Again not an expert in this language but Im just citing it here to give you a comparison of how these two languages differ.In general my advice to you would be to study the language at least for a bit and learn how to place your mouth to best pronounce those words. Listen to native speakers pronounce things in their own language and try to imitate them then as soon as youre done recite a line from a book or newspaper in your own language with the same mouth placement. Go on Duolingo and do a few lessons in some different languages and try to notice the nuances. You wont get a good feel for cadence or rhythm because most of the phrases they say are made from separate recordings of words spliced together but you can get a good feel for pronunciations. In scenes dont go for some random accent that doesnt exist just because you want to do an accent. If you have to do the best you can with the knowledge you have. Always commit to your accents. ,improv,dbwx2uw,2,t5_2qwok

11123149,0,t3_5yrkva,I think you mean premise vs organic. Even in organic scenes you will still look to find a game. ,improv,dessswn,8,t5_2qwok
11128062,0,t1_detclwi,The best improv is seamless because the best players know how to roll with shit. Also I find shared goals to be more important than shared styles.  I dont need  other mes on stage  but I do want  people who respect me.,improv,detcu6h,2,t5_2qwok
11189229,0,t1_df08wxs,Definitely dont waste money on a standup class. Improv needs to be learned through classes but standup is all about learning by doing.,improv,df0aaul,0,t5_2qwok
11252127,0,t3_60j3du,Friend none of it matters. In that moment every breath you take feels like magic. But look back a half hour after the show. Im willing to bet you dont remember it. Maybe a few bits but besides that its gone. Its gone the minute youre off stage. Thatll never happen again. You cant change what choices you made so it makes no sense to overthink or stress about them. In that moment of you realizing you made the wrong choice take  seconds. Take a deep breath. Its going to feel like forever but its just  seconds. Slow that judgmental brain down. Youre never going to hit that zone of dont think if your brain is burning in anxiety. Take  seconds reset and keep going. It might take time but its worth it ,improv,df7eu8y,4,t5_2qwok
11279827,0,t3_60qk8p,Basically put... Listen and pay attention.I had an instructor tell me that the difference between a goodgreat scene from a mediocreuncomfortable scene is basically are they really listening and paying attention to each other?.,improv,dfajvmv,3,t5_2qwok

11502987,0,t1_dfzk5ip,A great way to work on character is to play a version of freeze where you stay in as your character. The players on the back line enter and give the first line throwing you into a multitude of different scenarios. The key is to get your character in all kinds of trouble and get them out without breaking the character.That way you end up with more than one premise to draw from when youre ready to write sketches.,improv,dfzv3un,3,t5_2qwok
11690930,0,t1_dgl680v,Ten years from now I will definitely NOT remember this conversation. The only reason I continue to reply is the absurdity of this conversation is amusing to me. Im not a college kid. This happens to be my second masters degree. Hopefully in ten years time you will have matured enough to realize youre both ridiculous and an asshole.Again its a semihumorous piece and you dont know the scenario. But you have yourself a great life there buddy. Youll get far trying to prove others wrong and thinking that youre right all the time,improv,dgl6o20,2,t5_2qwok
