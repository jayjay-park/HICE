1378947,0,t1_cip2b41,I have saved that site for that work bench.  I thought about doubling up on the x legs though probably wont need it. ,Workbenches,cip4wxc,2,t5_2xo2s
1753061,0,t3_2ds5ul,Nice.  I built the same bench but with the MDF top.  Im planning on making a laminated split top for it soon though.  If I ever finish my commissioned projects first.  I still need to get some vices on it.,Workbenches,ck04qne,2,t5_2xo2s
1972958,0,t1_ckqxpfk,The pine is soft so you still get dings and scratches. Im not sure how much poly would help in this situation. ,Workbenches,ckqxx2n,5,t5_2xo2s
2485157,0,t3_2o03uh,Adjustable legs so as they grow they can still use it? Maybe a removable leg set so you can build a taller set of legs in  years? ,Workbenches,cmiy5f2,1,t5_2xo2s

3186835,0,t1_cos0qot,I bought plans from the Wood magazine store But ended up changing the dimensions so much that in the end the plans were useful for tips and tricks but not to build the actual bench.,Workbenches,cosbdqd,1,t5_2xo2s
5652957,0,t3_3sjbkf,This is similar to my current setup  Everything from Household tools to automotive all together. I am currenlty trying reorganize my tools into groups of most likely purpose and frequency of use.     ,Workbenches,cwxsz62,1,t5_2xo2s
5704078,0,t3_3t8njr,Are you looking for a woodworking vise or a mechanicsmachinists bench vise? They are very different beasts.As for bench vises the only place to find one for a decent price is garage sales or craigslist if it exists where you are. Ive picked up a halfdozen nice old American cast iron vises for between  and . The best score is a . Monarch for . The worst was a . Chas. Parker for  that turned out to have a hidden crack under the static jaw. Its now a paperweight. Id stick with proven names and countries of origin. The cheap ones from HF or wherever are JUNK. An old USA or England vise will serve you for decades if you treat it right. Its not an anvil its not a bearing press.I hate to sound like a broken record but check Garage Journal the guys there are often selling them or could direct you to local sales.,Workbenches,cx45aav,3,t5_2xo2s

6288289,0,t3_41qr2s,That thing looks like its well built. Seriously you could fit at least   hookers on there simultaneously.edited  didnt take bottom shelf into hooker calculations.,Workbenches,cz4eoms,3,t5_2xo2s
6288350,0,t1_cz4elnp,Sure! Its a Huky  roaster and allows me to roast up to a pound of green beans at a time I usually roast  grams. The computer is for my roasting software It monitors the temperature and plots it on a realtime graph and is mounted underneath the bench. Its a way smallquiet Intel Nuc.My garage smells like roasted chocolatey caramel awesome for about a day after I roast! Since I roast my own beans usually Im never drinking coffee older than  weeks old or so.,Workbenches,cz4exmm,4,t5_2xo2s

7229111,0,t1_d1zw493,See this pic  In my earlier reply I thought you were asking about the newer bench.  The mobile one definitely benefits from a table saw and hand plane,Workbenches,d1zw9sn,1,t5_2xo2s

11485726,0,t3_63y35b,Im planning on building a electronics workbench into a sort of cubby hole in my room. I do not have much woodowrking experience but i do have access to a table saw handheld saws plenty of lumber  by s and  inch ply wood as well as a plethora of other standard tools. Any suggestions for the kind of supports for the tabletop and what kind of joints i should use for the shelves?
