Well for one thing its how I discovered the Pups!In a thread discussing TalkBoxes someone mentioned Shaun and linked the video to Sleeper. One minute in I was hooked for sure.So you could say I owe my lifealtering experience to reddit!,SnarkyPuppy,cyrurp1,1,t5_2w1un

7332348,0,t1_d2bmuv8,Yeah Im not sure why but Ive never been able to get into Family Dinner all that much. Its not really Snarky Puppy. Its them with other artists and so of course it wont sound as much like them ,SnarkyPuppy,d2bmyw7,1,t5_2w1un
7433585,0,t1_d2lkppu,It does make sense. Many bands have suffered from the disparity between studio and live and the fact that they use so much production magic that cant be replicated in a live performance or feature instrumentsvoices that would be difficult to take on tour with them.Then there are the bands that are the other way around where their live stuff is often much better than the studio versions. Sometimes this is because they choose not to try to recreate it exactly but perform it in a version more suited to a live format. I think Snarky Puppy is skilled enough to do something like that. ,SnarkyPuppy,d2n5glt,1,t5_2w1un
