6299927,0,t1_cz5p9ls,I bought  sets yesterday myself just to see how expensive they will be. The last one most expensive one did cost me .. cents. Hmm I can only speculate I bought the cheapest available? That being said at least  games I mentioned constantly on giveaway and it makes little to none effort to farm free cards form them.  As I mentioned in the post Im open to counteroffers plus as I later mentioned in reply to someone else  if it will turn out I will be cheaper for me to sell key and buy sets  I will do that. Im reluctant because I prefer trading thats just habit and hobby. Selling something on Market besides free cards seems like waste to me.,SteamTradingCards,cz5qb3o,1,t5_2x961
