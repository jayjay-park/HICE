7778093,0,t3_4lv0o3,I grew up with the belief America has a special marketing message for the world. I believe that the promise of the American Dream has been the most effective informational tool America has wielded on the international scene.There are many scholars who consider the American Brand or Brand America to be our most important brand in America. Not Budweiser McDonalds or Coke  these all fall under an umbrella of the American Flag family of brands.Without a doubt Trump is almost running on a platform which is the opposite of the US National Strategic Communications Strategy  where for example the document statesATTACHMENT B GENERAL COMMUNICATION GUIDELINESDemonstrate respect. The most comprehensive survey we have conducted shows the number one thing the United States can do to improve public perception of our country is to demonstrate respect for other countries culture and contributions this is especially true in many Islamic countries. United States officials can demonstrate respect by visiting important historic and cultural sites during foreign travel actively scheduling listening events and opportunities to interact with foreign publics and listen to their point of view planning events that demonstrate respect for different cultural and faith traditions inviting respected local authors historians poets musicians etc to appear at USG sponsored events and attending important cultural and historical events in other countries. Use humility. The history of our own country is one of constantly striving and many times failing to live up to our own noble values. Our society is not perfect and we should not be afraid to admit that we face many challenges and struggle to live up to our own ideals..Use caution when dealing with faith issues in the public square. Government officials should be extremely cautious and if possible avoid using religious language because it can mean different things and is easily misconstrued. The extremists are murderers who pervert religion members of a cult that promotes death and destruction rather than legitimate practitioners of any faith. When it is necessary to make a point that involves Islam for instance quote Muslim voices themselves. Also avoid characterizing people of any faith as moderate  this is a political word which when extended to the world of faith can imply these individuals are less than devout and faithful. The terms mainstream or majority are preferable.Finally avoid phrases such as the Muslim community that imply it is monolithic Muslim communities like other faith communities are diverse. Create platforms where divergent ideas are encouraged and freely and openly debated. Support conferences sponsored by think tanks and foundations and intellectual publications that foster debates. Seek to empowerhighlight Muslim voices that speak out against terror and violence even when they do not agree with every aspect of U.S. foreign policy.ATTACHMENT C CORE MESSAGES  GENERAL As a diverse multicultural nation founded by immigrants America includes and respects people of different nations cultures and faiths. America seeks to be a partner for progress prosperity and peace. The American government wants to work in partnership with nations and peoples across the world in ways that result in a better life for all the worlds citizens. Because we believe all people are equal and equally valuable we believe people everywhere should be free to speak their mind to participate in their government to worship as their conscience dictates to assemble freely and to pursue opportunity economic political and creative. While we do not expect every country to shape its government like that of the United States we believe that citizens should be able to participate in choosing their governments and that those governments should be accountable to their citizens. We believe all people want to live in societies that are just governed by the rule of law and not corrupt. We believe in universal education with equal opportunity to learn for girls as well as boys. We believe in open markets and free trade to foster economic opportunity so all people have the ability to have productive jobs and provide for their families. As a nation where people are free to worship as their conscience dictates we respect all faiths. Many Muslims live work and worship freely in America and are an important part of American society.see Clearly there is a major disconnect between Trumps resilient domestic message and that of the message which America presents about herself to the world. Does Trumps assumption of the mantle of partial brand ambassador for the USA damage our reputation on the international scene?What is the downstream effect on business? We all know that a brand takes a long time to build but can nearly be destroyed overnight Audis truth in engineering anyone?.,NeverTrump,d3qazus,2,t5_3cvi0

8380621,0,t1_d5p49d6,I understand that reasoning from Trump supporters I really do. I tend to have more respect for people who recognize Trump as a necessary evil instead of people who run around trying to twist every mistake of his for the good. But I do understand the reasoning.I guess its just my worldview. I dont see it as a might. Bad character is bad character. Clinton is the one whose bad character has manifested on the national and international stages so we get the illusion that shes worse. And she is awful. Im not voting for her in a million years. But once you take Trumps policy flipflopping authoritarianism ignorance of law and Constitution incredibly thin skin and vindictiveness and petty low blows towards his opponents and extrapolate in into an environment of high pressure  like say the presidency  then I fully expect Trump to turn out just like Hillary. Accepting political favors betraying his campaign promises and calling it evolving or great deals threatening his opponents lying to the public  I see nothing in Trumps character to preclude any of that.Throw in the fact that Trump has spent most of his life as a trueblue liberal and even now is scaringly centrist at best now that he needs the Republicans vote and I also see him pulling a Hillary politically. If he cant even keep his stance on taxes straight as just ONE example I certainly dont trust him to stick to his promised list of Supreme Court nominees.If the but Hillary argument ever had a chance to work on me hey lets default on the national debt and call it renegotiating a deal was the last nail in its coffin.

8615618,0,t3_4xsu7e,I think its fascinating that a lot of these intellectuals support Trump according to the article because he represents the people.

To reasonably come to the conclusion that only the will of the people matters when time and again weve seen the will of the people usurp slow wise decisionmaking in favor of nationalistic charlatans is impossible to me. Im not speaking against democracy I am saying liberal democracy is easily manipulated.Tangentially related this is a pretty good quote from the article gtObviously the United States is not a model liberal democracy. America is less democratic than it might be because the preferences of the ultrawealthy often outweigh the preferences of everyone else and because many states make voting hard. America is less liberal than it might beit does not effectively guarantee individual rights or restrain executive powerbecause its nationalsecurity bureaucracy operates largely in secret without strong judicial or congressional oversight. These are serious problems. But they would be exacerbated not remedied by electing a candidate who bans journalists from his rallies slanders federal judges and says he would order the military to torture.Yes we can be mad about the system but we cant say any solution is better than the one we have.

10021217,0,t1_dbbqyc5,I disagree with them being fickle. I think they have bought Trump for Trump. What Trump says is truth so it will take a LOT to convince people to switch. He can do a  convince them it was necessary during the campaign but now he needs to change his mind and they will still bow down.,NeverTrump,dbdsjaf,2,t5_3cvi0

10785260,0,t3_5u96r2,You have got to be kidding me. This is just like the ridiculous article on my FB on Limbaugh blaming the leaks on bugs planted in the WH by Obama. trump is pissed off because it leaked out Flynn was conspiring with the Russians? How about at least faking outrage at the fact that you know HE WAS CONSPIRING WITH THE RUSSIANS? Unbelievable. Then to go on and whine about the traitor being treated unfairly???I feel like Im stuck in a nightmare. He is just absolutely unbelievable.,NeverTrump,ddsf67p,7,t5_3cvi0

10956073,0,t1_de8oo66,Turless when the article says Islamophobes its largely referring to the altright paranoids who are undermining conservatives credibility in their opposition to radical Islam. It also points out that McMaster is smarter than and just as tough as the ignorant Steven Bannon and a rather surprising choice given that hes likely to butt heads with Bannon. Thats either Trump being really smart or really stupid but in either case I like the appointment.,NeverTrump,dea1hfg,3,t5_3cvi0
