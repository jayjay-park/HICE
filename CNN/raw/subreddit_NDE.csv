1985858,0,t1_cksdury,Id not categorize it as an NDE although that specific insight is a facet of many peoples NDEs. I have a lot of experience with meditation as in doing retreats that last for days where you dont speak to anyone and you meditate from the first bell at  to bedtime at . Yes sitting eating and walking  meditation all included. IMS and Spirit Rock type meditation retreats.Anyway what you describe is an opening or insight. These things happen spontaneously at times and sometimes a person does things to evoke them such as a lot of meditation or perhaps some drug use. Realize I am saying that they can happen spontaneously.The insight you are describing is significant. Yes everything is exactly as it should be even as messed up as things seem. What youre saying is very true.We do need to keep wisdom understanding things such as what you just deeply realized balanced with compassion willingness to help others. A wonderful teacher I once worked with said it like thisgtWe are to make the world the best that it can be while loving it exactly as it is.  Matthew FlicksteinIts true. Everythings perfect. I have that opening from time to time had it again today in fact. Its not a la de da feeling its a deep opening to the truth of things as they are. How fortunate that you are tuned in to open to these insights.,NDE,ckshvlz,1,t5_2sapp
10373040,0,t3_5nanvz,Even if you feel it wont impact the world in a meaningful way doesnt mean this is the case. If people enjoy your game then you have bought them happiness atleast temporarily. And as the other guy said people have met in these games and have made friends and relationships. And the reason it has meaning and purpose is because you give it meaning and purpose. It is something that YOU love doing and it is something that WILL have an impact no matter how big or small. Good luck friend.,NDE,dcjuh5t,2,t5_2sapp
