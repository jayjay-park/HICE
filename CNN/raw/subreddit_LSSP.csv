210496,0,t3_1pvgvg,Gamertag mjmMicrophone YesAge Location Detroit MITimes    ESTLevel What you hope to get out of the crew I love to be a team player and chase perps.  Furthermore I also like inserting sharpshooters into position hot extractions and synchronized takedowns.  I am good behind the wheel.  Before the patch I boasted a fully stocked garage full of police vehicles including undercover Buffalo Granger squad car NOOSE van.  Sadly those were all lost.I can handle myself even better in a chopper.  I can make due with any type from Cargo Bobs to Buzzards unarmed.  Once I match speeds with the perp my skill shows when I can angle my chopper so that my passengers can disable the vehicle.  With boots on the ground I can offer support using the Buzzard READ  I do not own it or the Blackhawk.  I cant wait til Rockstar allows players to rappel out of teammates choppers.I am looking for a semiorganized experience.  If a perp is being chased I would like to see people heading him off blocking off routes.  Through teamwork and communication I want to catch the crook.I have had this game since release and most of my friends have moved on to other games or the Xbox One.  This would be my first roleplaying team or group.  ,LSSP,cf2f4m5,1,t5_2yyfa
