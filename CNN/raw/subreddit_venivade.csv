10245254,0,t3_5mpft8,One of my favorite old school tracks.  Rozalla was born in Zambia an is probably best known as lead vocalist for band of Gypsies. She released I Love Music in  which is itself a remix of the original song by the OJays from the s Rozallas version of the song became popular in the s because it was on the soundtrack of the movie Carlitos Way.The Overworld mix of Rozallas I Love Music was done by Development Corporation who were Johnny Ekubia aka Johnny Jay and Neil Claxton aka Missing Link. I think that this was the only cut that the two collaborated on. I dont know much about Ekubia but I do remember reading that Claxton did a stint with Urban Cookie Collective and was a part of the duo and later solo Mint Royale.,venivade,dc5cu9b,1,t5_326du
