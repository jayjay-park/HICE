8802596,0,t3_50lt49,Avocado The smartest one and never anxious. Wears reading glasses all the time even when shes not doing her usual job studying. Is also really athletic but really nice. She has a great singing voice. Her home is a manor on an the other side of Yoyle Mountain compared to the side where Yoyle City is on She always helps out others when they need it. Inside her manor she has some lovely flowers Orchids are her favorite! a bunch of books and a whole room with medicine cabinets. She often throws reunion parties in her manor with the others in Yoyleland where she sets up fancy big dinners in the kitchen and plays Waltz Music. She is also respectful to nature and its surroundings and one day wants to take the IDFB contestants out for a boat ride to show the world out there. I could just imagine two scenes one with her and the others running through nature with other wild animals and the other with them looking at a sunset with Yoyleland in the distance. She is the most respectful object show contestant of all time. You could count on her for taking the odds down. This is Avocado.,bfdi_recommend,d75yao3,1,t5_3g2ll
