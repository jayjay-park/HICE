2955839,0,t3_2tzas5,TigerDestruction has it correct. Once youve reached Soul Mate you can incarnate a gene any time. When you start a new character based on the gene all of the stuff you had in your characters inventory not storage! goes into the new characters heir trunk. And once you have some deeds you can get them out. Special quest items like the monster heart or cooler box do not carry over. I tend to do this when ive got some decent equipment but feel like my current character is in a rut then I start a new one with a few favorite toys from my old and and go from there..The Elona Wiki link on the right sidebar has great information on marriage. Enjoy.,Elona,co43dhg,1,t5_2sks4

Or is it actually a viable way to kill say Estork the Doggod?Because I have my Exile and I want to evolve her dammit.,Elona,cv4hlau,2,t5_2sks4
5230869,0,t1_cvghv3c,Ah great! That was actually something I was going to suggest Elona Custom really puts more story into the game. When I played it a few years back I mostly just grinded through everything without taking any notice to the actual plot.,Elona,cvgiegs,1,t5_2sks4

9961351,0,t1_db5yzcn,Thanks for the info! Just wondering would I be better off beginning Elona with Elona . or would someone possibly be able to point me in the direction of a download for Elona .? I still cant find one that works. Thanks!,Elona,db5znbr,1,t5_2sks4

11718304,0,t3_67215r,Having one and exactly one pet in your party that knows the Cooking skill and always going to sleep at about  PM will help tremendously. Every time you wake up your pet will have cooked a meal for you and your other pets which will improve the potentials of the entire partys stats. By having only one such pet its cooking skill will be trained rapidly and eventually it will always cook highquality breakfast that increases attribute potentials by a lot.,Elona,dgoariu,2,t5_2sks4
