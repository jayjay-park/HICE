7328658,0,t3_4fn4gk,Could you get a section on blesssource for translated patch notes?  I know it would be a huge investment but I would love to see a visual guide or some such to the class skills.  Hell even some basic guides like crafting and combat would be welcome.  Also not every section needs comments and some comments you do have on your site are several years old and irrelevant.On a personal note really looking forward to info on the Mystic but I guess it isnt in the latest patches yet.EDIT  Also some basic things like what races can be what classes would be great.  In the future I would love to see a site not unlike Wowhead.  At the very least a place that tells me about everything that can be tamed would be great.  But having a full breakdown with user comments on what can be tamed where how if its a petmountminion and any rarity or challenges associated with the tame.,Bless,d2b7vpn,4,t5_2vhzf
7331886,0,t1_d2a3ilm,No I dont understand why?  That all happened a long time ago and we have great games such as the Wolfenstein FPS series that are based entirely about Nazis and their antics..If some oversensitive people get the hump then let them.,Bless,d2bl2uj,3,t5_2vhzf

10607101,0,t1_dda166u,Im far from certain myself but I remember a comment on here and what should be his profile on LinkedIn stating as much. I also dont make a habit of following news such as this though so who knows.,Bless,dda1hpq,1,t5_2vhzf
10659132,0,t3_5rgzze,ehhhhh going to get flack for this Im sure but I dont trust Aeria games I would have pefered Trion to take that shit and we all know how they can be. NCsoft would have been great to pick it up they have done alright with there games. Eden Enternal was an mmo I played for some time and its riddle with Cash shop cancer. ,Bless,ddfepct,1,t5_2vhzf
