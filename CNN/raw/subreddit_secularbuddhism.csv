954558,0,t3_251old,In many places where Buddhism exists the people are suffering  monks included. From my own experiences I have found that the Buddhist monks serve as an example to the people. Or more so as something symbolic they represent that another way of life is possible. Happiness is achievable now! Their very presence helps to relieve suffering. In this cultural context it does change the purpose of the monk from what you have written. Furthermore the majority of lay people practising Buddhism live in poorer countries the people there are in no way cheating and are constantly confronting suffering in ways people in the developed world dont confront so often.gtWhen you are a monk or a nun you exist in some sort of artificial environment.I would question this premise too. You exist in an environment no matter where you are. What do you mean by artificial? The fact it is an environment catered todesigned to facilitate the noble eightfold path? Im interested in what you would consider real? Or is real just a synonym for normal?,secularbuddhism,chcsi7b,5,t5_2uayt

4004903,0,t3_32wt09,Buddhism does not exist to fulfill the individual or offer any one person some sort of secret to happiness or transcendence or whatever. Buddhism is simply a lifeway that teaches the path to peace and that path is different for everyone. For many that path is one of hardship and doubt. If you are experiencing troubles with Buddhism you should look deep inside yourself to discover if your problems are actually internal ones that you are projecting onto the outside world in this case onto Buddhism. Buddhahood or enlightenment or pure being or whatever you would like to call it and imagine it is is a state of being that we may achieve here on Earth within our own lifetimes given the practice of enough right action. One of the fundamental precepts of Buddhism is practicing right action as opposed to right thought. You can think and meditate on enlightenment and suffering all you want but until you begin to practice the life of the Buddha until you start to accept and spread love infinitely you will never get anywhere. If you feel that Buddhism currently isnt working for you roll up the bamboo mat and stop meditating put down the Sutras and get out into the world and give back to the people around you. I promise that whatever love you spread will be returned onemillionfold. When you give love freely and accept it freely you will truly be practicing Buddhism and I promise all doubt will flee from your heart. ,secularbuddhism,crcsfyi,2,t5_2uayt
4004917,0,t1_cqfcz1w,There should be no judgements here when someone asks for help we must give it freely because we were blind to their need and did not offer help first. ,secularbuddhism,crcsi0h,1,t5_2uayt
4403831,0,t3_3bfp9n,Vote. And make sure your own children get a good education.If you live in a place where creationism in schools is an issue  like Louisiana for instance  I would call my local representatives and voice my displeasure and become involved with my school board. Well lets be real  Id move. But if thats not an option then the other things.As a Buddhist theres really nothing you can do other than try and remain compassionate. Many of these people really believe this stuff even though it is nonsense. Getting in their face about it isnt going to make things better.,secularbuddhism,csm1oqf,3,t5_2uayt

6169551,0,t1_cyqurn5,Thats actually a very good point. Ive never had any of that other stuff. Money was always tight and by the time it wasnt I didnt really see the point. I have one set of mala beads that I use for very specific circumstances I only use one mantra with them and when my brain wont calm down. Otherwise I just keep it simple. Ive known some people to dedicate an entire room to their meditation which I think would be awesome but not simple. The money aspect of my life I think more than anything forced me to live a life of simplicity and be able to detach from desires or things. Which doesnt mean there isnt some desire there wouldnt it be nice to have all those nice things. But Ive become very happy with a life that comfortably meets my needs rather than having other things too. But now I feel like Im going down this whole other road that brings in economics which... I dont want to even begin. ,secularbuddhism,cyqwx1f,2,t5_2uayt
8737219,0,t1_d6xos8k,I think having a goal is attachment. Attachment leads to suffering.  I also think happiness isnt the goal.  Its just a byproduct of meditation.gtI probably only do meditation as it seems to lessen my suffering and considerably.Thats why I do it too.  Originally I wanted a powerful mind capable of great things.  Thirty years later I just want peace.,secularbuddhism,d6xsunj,1,t5_2uayt
9443950,0,t1_d9cxg0h,Nope I have no reason to think that awareness and emotion are not subject to the law of impermanence.Back in the s in the USSR a guy named Stcherbatsky wrote a book and submitted it to the censors for publication approval. It turned out that the book was ununderstandable to the censors and they approved the publication. Fifty years or so later a spiritual friend told me that Stcherbatskys book was the most important book on Buddhism in the th century. The title of the book is Buddhist Logic. If you can find a copy you will be richly rewarded. Referring to the old Indian Buddhist works in the th and th centuries Dharmakiriti is quoted as saying All successful human action is necessarily preceded by right thought therefore we are going to investigate it. You just gotta love this shit.Best of luck to you. Be kind to yourself.sdbear,secularbuddhism,d9d364y,1,t5_2uayt
