5051695,0,t3_3k0fjz,What about the difference between author and contributor?I am not so much worried about the publishing but instead about being able to upload any video or pictures for articles or what not.Keep in mind I am not even remotely acquainted with wordpress although I will be able to learn at least the basics probably.,geopoliticsblog,cuux5nm,2,t5_39c1f
6104398,0,t3_3z5vcq,Crossposted this comment on rgeopolitics too.Argeo is a clever name.  I have a couple important questions that many are probably wondering about this brand new startup.Sometimes cranks write articles whether its about chemtrails or about the democratic annexation of Crimea. Which article submissions will you accept and which will you turn down?The current beta article seems... not high quality in my very limited judgement. Is the beta article indicative of the quality of final articles? What level of quality is required for a submission to be published?Thanks for taking the time to put together such a difficult undertaking. Its not easy to start from scratch and get all the wheels moving at once.,geopoliticsblog,cyjiaf8,4,t5_39c1f
