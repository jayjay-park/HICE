9724436,0,t1_dabpxcm,I have searched already and didnt find a definite answer. There are reports about specific chipsets working after compiling separate modules or chipsets working ok as n dongles but nothing about an ac stick that will work as pnp.Concerning Intel obviously you feel at ease with vPro and ME but I prefer to believe thisgtThe Intel Management Engine with its proprietary firmware has complete access to and control over the PC it can power on or shut down the PC read all open files examine all running applications track all keys pressed and mouse movements and even capture or display images on the screen. And it has a network interface that is demonstrably insecure which can allow an attacker on the network to inject rootkits that completely compromise the PC and can report to the attacker all activities performed on the PC. It is a threat to freedom security and privacy that cant be ignored.from ,linuxhardware,dabqzyf,1,t5_3gxbf
9798123,0,t1_dakrr6i,Does yours have a matte or a glossy display? Do you know the full model name?,linuxhardware,daktwgd,1,t5_3gxbf
10020851,0,t3_5j5tvv,Others are recommending XX here but honestly those are a little overpowered for what you want.  My X is a powerhouse batteryhungry and just as capable as any desktop.  The sortofold battery lasts under an hour now.  They can be a little bit over your price range but they are the best value at that price.  That said you would probably be happy with a much less powerful machine if you want to go lighter smaller or cheaper.  Lately Ive been wishing for a lighter longerlasting netbook to go along with the X.  Its just way more powerful and chunky than I need for most daytoday tasks.  Its small but its a big small laptop  and the older models are even chunkier.An Acer C or another good chromebook could be another solid choice!,linuxhardware,dbdqtk0,3,t5_3gxbf

10262780,0,t3_5msjif,Yes my XPS   does have coil whine or rather electrical noise especially when taxing the iGPU. I can notice it in a quiet room otherwise it doesnt bother me but in a quiet room it can really get on my nerves. The amount of noise seems to vary from unit to unit and for example my girlfriend who has tinnitus cant hear my laptop at all. Heres an example video I found on Youtube ,linuxhardware,dc7cbks,2,t5_3gxbf

10805789,0,t3_5ui221,Benchmarking suggests a skylakekabylake does better but its somewhat dependent on how the appgame is coded.  Some are cpu boundlike WoW and some are GPU boundlike QuakeDoometc and some are a bit of both.,linuxhardware,ddujhna,1,t5_3gxbf

10979905,0,t1_decidgt,only thing that really bothers me besides my desire for K screens is that GB of RAM. Yall saying its enough but right now I look at my current system running which is basically just browsers running is using .GB of RAM. It goes up to  or GB easily.Browsers really use quite a lot these days.,linuxhardware,decjdc2,1,t5_3gxbf

11779952,0,t1_dgvadzh,I want a laptop because I travel to multiple game stores and Livestream events they run to twitch.  I figured I could put a laptop in the same bag as my video equipment and just have less stuff to carry around.  Basically all Im doing is hooking up a Go Pro camera and having obs stream it to twitch since thats the platform that just proven the most popular in my experience.,linuxhardware,dgvamyh,1,t5_3gxbf
