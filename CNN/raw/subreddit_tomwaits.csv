9180407,0,t1_d8f3to0,First of all I want to point out that when I own a good number of cds by Tom Waits and I buy each one brand new as that way I make sure Tom gets the money since he made the album.I think you misunderstood my confusion about the album being removed with me actively upset and whining about this which is not the case. You assumed something and then made along post about it. Good job.In regards to me paying for spotify premium there was maybe still is a deal where you can pay  a month for spotify premium and up to  accounts have access to it provided you live in the same house. This way I am paying th the monthly price of spotify premium so no I could not buy an album a month with this money.I understand this will upset you as artists will get even less money from this and I understand. Perhaps this is why his album was removed and others may follow. I understand why artists dislike spotify and I agree as I believe they should make the vast vast majority of money form their artwork whether in the music industry games film etc. Therefore I have no problem with artists removing songs form spotify I probably would too.However as a consumer spotify is a good service that allows me to listen to music ont he go. And as a student money isnt being poured into my pockets for me to spend so frivolously as you suggest I am.I dissagree that spotify is radio as I DO have a choice in what music on there I listen to.I am with you in your comments of a case that streaming as an ownership replacement is basically the legitimization of piracy. as I am actively against piracy of any kind. This is why I buy DVDs cds and games new as often as I can so the money gets where it is deserved.However while services like netfix spotify apple music etc exist I deem it perfectly acceptable to take part in these programs.Thank you for your evidence and sources I found them interesting but you were oreaching to the choir.TlDR You misunderstood my initial intention of the post and my feelings towards a lot of topics so went off on a great big rant. You were wrong about me but had your heart in the right place. Perhaps find out my actual opinion before you try to slam home a massive Your a shit person and heres whyEDIT I even said joeshmoS  points  hours ago Cant buy albums on spotify. You can pay for premium spotify which I do for unlimited playsThat being said I am working towards a cd of each album...Seriously dude,tomwaits,d8fomj6,1,t5_2rvi2
