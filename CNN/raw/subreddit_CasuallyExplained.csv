10651814,0,t1_ddel9f7,I loved that bit I thought it was genius. At first I thought that the situation presented was an impossibility. However upon reflection I think that this is entirely possible in game. Assuming that the mine is placed in the centre   and not with the mines on the outside like this   with a mine in the centre would require all of the surrounding blocks to show a   which they do. However because of this the blocks on the outside perimeter would then require to not be touching any mines also. Therefore minesweeper by default would automatically rule out those options with  mines touching.  However all of these could be covered with just  more mines.   green ticks represent mineless squares and red crosses represent mined squares.I cant wait to show this problem solving to my crush...,CasuallyExplained,ddeni8v,13,t5_3bx9x
