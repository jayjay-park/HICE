6462842,0,t3_3npyg3,Heres a negative Salter review from the BBB websiteby marc m. on did not ship complete spiral staircase had to go and buy hardware which should have came with the staircase called and spoke to customer service did not get no help and no calls back from managers I will never buy from them again and I hope you guys do the sameThis customer had a NEGATIVE experience with this business.This customer WOULD NOT recommend the business to a friend family member neighbor or colleague.Comment from the BusinessOur customer service team has been in contact with Mark and sent him out the missing item from his order. The order was for a spiral stair kit and Mark did not realize that there had to be some modifications to his order once it was received. Our last communication with Mark is that the stairs are installed and in working order. Since receipt of this review we even reached out to Mark to follow up. by on And marc n. repliesThis is a complete and false statement. The fact that you have audacity to come forward to write a post thats a complete lie. I had to go and purchase the hardware that was left out. A three day project turns into a week becuase of missing product. I was on the phone with customer service amp told them what was going on. Their responce was what would you like me to do about it how unprofessional can somebody beI did not ask  pieces to be missing from a stair case that I ordered from you it is your responsibility to make sure that all the pieces are secure and in the package and they were not. When your company wants to honestly call me about this situation than do so. Untill than do not throw a response out that is false. unbelievable,spiralstairs,cznsvui,1,t5_3a7z1
