4598636,0,t3_3cyhjn,Keep in mind that this  mile radius rule only applied after all the Esphenis electronics went out of operation. So either the mechs or an array was used to control the Skitters. gtcocheese mentions they were building a new power source in sepIt was a guess not a fact. Cochise was saying how they are down on Earth doing reconissiance to try to destroy the Espheni power core but they could not find it. They also guess that the Espheni are currently building it. The Volm were not aware of the power source on the moon at all its more like the Volm had bad intelligence and the Espheni have had a power source for a long time. ,FallingSkies,cta8xso,1,t5_2scqt

They would make a fly swatter or flamethrower.Strength in numbers? Battlefield fodder to use up enemy resources? Theres plenty of tactical reasons. Plus a flamethrower is useless without a solider to use it.gtWe have also saw no evidence that the bugs have attacked anything other than humans.It would make sense not to attack the Espheni if the Espheni have no knowledge of the Dornian as bugs.

4976017,0,t1_culgd96,My thoughts on the finale were similar.

How EXACTLY did Tom Mason get back to Earth? Dont just show us flashes.
