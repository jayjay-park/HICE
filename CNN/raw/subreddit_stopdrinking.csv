I have always been an open book its just the way I am. I have often found these conversations to be therapeutic and rewarding for both parties. It presents challenges sometimes especially with coworkers who might think of me as unreliable unstable or otherwise morally deficient. Dealing with this addiction is among the most difficult and formative experiences of my life and I hope that through honest dialogue I am helping to address the social stigma of this disease. Almost everyone knows an alcoholic or drug addict. I didnt know much about the disease either until I had to confront it myself. So I usually say I drank too much so I had to stop which often leads into a conversation that Im generally happy to have.If its not a conversation youre comfortable with you might try saying Im allergic.

90299,0,t3_1v3mdk,I had a some traumatic events in my late teensearly twenties that I could surely look back and blame. But really I think the fact that I was always around people  and put myself  around people who completely normalized binge drinking for me all throughout my twenties was the biggest problem. I remember finally being able to sit down with my restaurant coworkers after I turned  and have a shift beer. I felt so grown up. Then I proceeded to date men in their s I was still under  who were hardcore alcoholics. I thought they were the coolest cats at the bar but now I see they were just grizzled alcoholics who never grew the fuck up and left the bar behind them. But for me it made me romanticize drink quite a bit more. There are other factors too and I dont want to sound like I am blaming my alcoholism on my surroundings. I know that I am an alcoholic because I am wired that way. But putting myself in that environment sure brought it out of me. After a whirlwind early s with lots of completely out of control drinking I stabilized and my drinking did too. I became a stable functioning alcoholic  always had a job and paid my rent etc. But the truth is I could still polish off half a bottle of whiskey or more on a weeknight or pound a  pack of beer. Im  now and Im just sick of it. And thats why I am not drinking today. And right now thats way more important than whatever reasons I had for starting.,stopdrinking,ceopjri,1,t5_2s7yr

Just because some people socalled alcoholics slide faster down the slope of drug addiction doesnt mean that alcoholism is something inborn. All drinkers are in the same trap some just further than others.I dont give any attention to the idea that alcohol has health benefits. Heres some reading about thatThere are many dangers associated with the use of morphine. It has its benefits as a painkiller when used in a medical setting by qualified people but its anything but harmless. The only comparison between alcohol and morphine I can deduce is that alcohol can also deaden your senses for a while  but when it wears off the problem is still there and you have the added stress of eliminating the toxic byproducts from your body. In truth there are no benefits to consuming alcohol.,stopdrinking,cettr15,1,t5_2s7yr

161329,0,t3_1vxf2r,Hey it sounds like the pink cloud has dissipated. That happens. Life can be difficult and we arent guaranteed happiness every day. This is something that it took me a while to figure out and I still havent figured out the best way to say it so bear with me. Its thisPeople arent supposed to be happy all the time or feel good all the time. Sometimes we feel bad sometimes we feel blah sometimes we feel angry or sad or any of the other wide variety of human emotions. This is as it should be. And really if we were happy all the time happiness wouldnt mean anything. Alcoholics and addicts learn to shortcircuit our feelings with substances. Sad? Drink. Angry? Drink? Bored? Drink. Actually genuinely happy? Better kick that up a notch with a drink. We all know how well that works in the long term. Hint not well at all.I guess what Im trying to say is that part of learning to live sober for me has been learning to live with emotions. Learning that they all exist and that I will feel them all and that they cant kill me. Learning to live in the moment experience what Im feeling and know I wont feel it forever. When I first started going to AA meetings I used to hear people say learning to be a human being. This is what I think they were talking about. No its not easy but its part of life. You can do it.  You arent guaranteed anything in this life but you can ensure yourself sobriety today. Dont worry about the rest of your life or forever just dont drink today. You can do that.I hope my rambling makes sense and helps a little bit. Good luck.,stopdrinking,cewt407,11,t5_2s7yr

When the main activity of an event is drinking I dont belong there. What helped me was AA meetings. They not only filled time but taught me how to be sober and have fun. I met interesting people and made friends.Theres more to recovery than not drinking. AA opened a door to a world I didnt know existed. I also got a counselor which helped me explore issues and goals.

When I stopped drinking but before I started working the steps the only thing that changed was I wasnt drinking but I was still pissed off. After starting the steps speaking with others in recovery I realized all this bullshit with other people is coming from problems I have inside of me.

222849,0,t1_cf358ad,LB change happened really slowly over the last  years finally culminating in quitting alcohol for good. Alcohol was by far my stickiest vice harder than smoking amphetamines frivolous relationships. Believe me when I first quit pills I spent a whole summer in bed getting rejected from restaurant jobs watching podcasts on YouTube. I had dropped out of school and my dad wanted me to join the military. The first thing I did was get healthy nutrition and running I had control over that and then the ball started rolling. I started running food at a restaurant met a girl finished school found some secure office work started performing and writing and now I finally cut drinking out for good and all these things fell into place.  years week by week one sacrifice after another and then suddenly your tires pick up the road and youre moving. If I had started by quitting drinking It would have been the same process youre going through. You hit rock bottom and then you spend years crawling backbut the whole thing feels great because youre growing slowly but surely and growth is happiness even when you start at a low spot. Everybodys recovery will look different Im just glad things are finally starting to click for me and my confidence is getting back to where it was when I was really young and the world felt like it was made for me. ,stopdrinking,cf3tt4t,2,t5_2s7yr

284389,0,t1_cfa7zby,As someone that is very familiar with the type of work and position your advisor is in I would never in a million years put myself in a position where I was drinking one on one  especially with a student of a different gender. Even when I was drinking heavily  I avoided those situations at all cost.If this is a female studentmale advisor situation I would really question your advisors motives in pressuring you to drink with him. Men sometimes pressure women to drink in order to get them in a vulnerable situation and take advantage of them. As an older male in a position of power and responsibility this person sounds like a creep.About the only real leverage you have in this situation is if you have your own funding. You could simply say if drinking heavily with you is a requirement to earn my degree I may have to find another advisor. If I misunderstood your intentions I apologize and we can put this in the past provided you do not make it an issue in the future.You could also bring it up during your next one on one conference and ask by the way why were you so interested in whether or not I drink alcohol?.Another way to approach this during sober daylight hours is hey  I appreciate you wanting everyone to have fun and drink with you but Im really trying to quit and I feel like you were trying to sabotage me. I have some serious health concerns and would appreciate your support. Get him on your side if you can and when your fellow grad students pressure you he hopefully will say mind your own business  its not cool to pressure someone to drink  stop acting like high school students and grow up....at least thats what I would say....with much harsher language.RememberIm a male in a similar position to your advisor. Im also an alcoholic. I never ever behaved this way. Him being a drinker or an alcoholic does not excuse this. I couldnt give two shits if anyone else was drinking or not.I was really hoping this was a problem with a postdoc. It would have been a lot easier...and possibly more entertaining for all of us.

327471,0,t3_1xuf5j,Moderation is something I never did while drinking. Or if I did it was a one time only thing. Usually Id be the one who was  or  beers ahead of everyone else maybe even sneaking in shots and eventually blacked out. And it was every environment.  Were at a baseball game? Double fisting time. House party? Lets shotgun some beers! Night at the bar? Lets do some Jagerbombs! Eventually after a humiliating blackout Id have one or two with a dinner or maybe go out and have one or two but that didnt last long. Sooner or later Id be lapping people or even worse going to another bar alone after everyone went home.And I noticed this in EVERYTHING I did too. Maybe it is a character thing. When I smoked I ripped cigs more than a pack a day. Your pizza analogy was great... Id eat until I was FULL I chug cups of coffee all day. Its a sign of the ability to get addicted I think. The go hard or go home approach is okay for some things but with drinking it could ruin you. My goal now is to replace the abusive things I overdid with healthy things.

328915,0,t3_1xusrq,I suffer from a mood disorder and frequently day to day experience anxiety and racing thoughts ranging from unpleasant to debilitating. Since my late teens I selfmedicated with alcohol and it helped distract me comfort me and balance out whatever swing I was in at the time. I quit drinking almost a year ago and when I did I was expecting that my mood disorder and anxiety would become harder to manage without alcohol to keep them in check.I was completely wrong.In the first couple of months of quitting I did experience a few ups and downs as my mind and body adjusted. I had nightmares and insomnia and irritability and my usual mental weather  but I found myself dealing with it far better than Id managed to when I was drinking and that was a pleasant and confusing surprise. Ive thought about it a lot since and Ive realised that when I was medicating with alcohol I was really just making things worse. I might have felt better superficially but the myriad subtle disruptions that drinking inflicted on my equilibrium and judgement kept me offbalance and underresourced. When I stopped drinking I found that I was able to deal with my problems far more calmly rationally and effectively than I had thought myself capable. I now look at my use of alcohol with regret that what I thought was helping me was clearly not but also with embarrassment as I now realise a good deal of my symptoms were the result of my drinking. People often talk in this sub about the devious nature of alcohol and how it convinces you it is supporting you when to is actually undermining you  in my experience that is dead right. I would encourage you to think very carefully and very honestly whether drinking is actually helping you or whether it is a false comfort.

416789,0,t3_1yuilr,Early on it was devastating to see people I looked up to for support go back out. But it made me more vigilant. If it can happen to them it can happen to me.I have compassion for them though. I had liver failure a couple years ago and was obviously told I could never drink again. But I wasnt ready to stop. I loved alcohol and it was the only thing I still had that made me happy. Within  months I started drinking again. I couldnt stand life sober and didnt care in fact I wanted to die drunk. My family and friends were distraught. I didnt care. After a  month  bender I had lost it all. Job home money and most of my friends. Thats when I sobered up. I failed at killing myself and my only option was to figure out how to live again.So I cant judge anyone for relapsing. I realize they are in some kind of pain and the only relief they know is to drink. When I help people new in recovery I encourage them to identify their pain and figure out how to fix it. It could be with medication support groups therapy or many other things. We drank to fix something. When we get sober we have to figure out what we were fixing with alcohol and find another way to fix it or else we will end up drunk again.A good friend of mine just went out on a crack binge.

425633,0,t3_1ywqez,That can happen. Just ignore the condescending stuff. Some people at AA use circular logic. For example they did  in  and got sober...so the only way to get sober is to so  in . At least thats what was a deal breaker for me getting a sponsor.You will hear the only requirement is a desire to stop drinking a lot but my experience is that when you start showing up people will start asking you what step you are on why you dont have a sponsor etc. People generally are asking you those things because they care about you and want you to experience the joy of sobriety that they are enjoying. Doing AA typically means meetings reading the big book prayer to your HP working with a sponsor and ultimately helping others.There are many paths to sobriety. AA is one of the few institutions left in the world that does exactly what it says it will do  sober you up. Dont let some negative stuff keep you from going. Ive been called a dummy with a book because I didnt have a sponsor. I just let that go  he is welcome to his opinion...and I eventually got a sponsor that is willing to understand I have a life outside of AA.Take the good stuff...ignore the bad. ,stopdrinking,cfovrei,2,t5_2s7yr

483321,0,t1_cfv6qn8,gt The idea of AA seems bad for me because I know it is filled with a lot of theistic values giving yourself over to a higher power kind of ideas but I am glad to know that it has helped so many people stay strong amp better their livesThere was a pretty good thread or two about this last night on ralcoholism you might find interesting.Im one of the AA proponents so take what Im about to say with a grain of salt or dismiss it out of hand as you wish.  Alcoholism is a mental disorder classified a couple different ways within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association DSMV.  Its an obsessive compulsive disorder that when triggered results in the physical compulsion to drink which in my case leads to dangerously uncontrolled drinking and judgment that is so impaired that I do things like drive drunk with small children in the back seat blow up my professional practice not pay taxes not report my income go to prison etc.  Ive yet to find a way to think my way out of my mental disorders and alcoholism has been no exception.  I needed others I needed help.  And while AA is not the ONLY way my guess is that within  minutes of most urban centers in the US and a lot of other countries you can access a free recovery meeting.AA contrary to your impression is not a religious program but you are right there are many theists involved as there are doctors lawyers and judges bankers truck drivers thieves con artists sex workers parents grandparents students and probably not a few of your neighbors.  Many of us are atheists and agnostics buddhists muslim hindu and Ive know a few wiccans.  There is every good reason to believe that Bill Wilson one of the cofounders of AA was a nonbeliever.  As I said in a comment last night WHY is it important that I come to believe in a higher power?  Its important because in the st Step we admitted that we are powerless over alcohol and that our lives are unmanageable. Recovery in AA is not dependent on WILLPOWER instead we recognize that through our own selfish approach to our lives and alcohol we bollixed it pretty thoroughly.I am not sure there is a creator beyond my parents and their parents and the evolutionary process that began with a Big Bang and ended up with the ingredients of life on this tiny rockbut I AM NOT THE CREATOR. Something created me and everything around me and our world. We were created with the chemistry and elements from dying starstruly we are stardust. When I walked out of the darkness of alcoholism mental illness and wreckage of my lifeI walked into the light of creation. That light that energy the spirit of that which is reflected in all of us is my higher power. I believe that we together our spirit together striving to reach a new sober dimension are a higher power over my alcoholism. When I share here or in an AA meeting or in my own personal life among friends or family I am tapping into that limitless source. This works for me.So this all may be a little too muchbut as you go along I hope that you will not dismiss out of hand the support and recovery available in your immediate neighborhood without investigating it for yourself.  ,stopdrinking,cfv7gj4,1,t5_2s7yr
485519,0,t3_1zo1c0, There but for the grace of God go I. When I point a finger at someone there are three pointing back at me.Said differently Ive probably done whatever this person is doing to frustrate me and if I think about it I may still be doing it just not at this moment and chances are looking back on my behavior Ive probably done a lot worse. Please allow me to show the same patience and tolerance I would have wanted from others when I was or am acting poorly. It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed no matter what the cause there is something wrong with us Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions step  page Which then leads to an inner dialog that is more about curiosity and discovery than the immediate irritant. Why can I not accept this situation or person? Am I afraid of something maybe that I will not get something that I want or feel that there is a risk that Ill lose something that I already have? And in some situations especially where there may be no black and white answer I find the parable of the  blind men and an elephant comes into play That is to say just because I cannot see someone elses point of view or they cannot see mine does not mean that we both cant be right. It is possible that we are both partially correct buy just cannot see enough of the big picture to know or understand it.

491742,0,t1_cfvx5pc,gt I dont know that I think its the difficulty of quitting that determines whether someone has an alcohol problem or not. Completely agree here.  Its fairly common for someone who kicks a longterm habit of daily drinking to become a binge drinker.  The difference here is that the binge drinker quits starts quits starts.Its the not starting part that I find more difficult.  And I also find it more important because I want to continue pushing and opening myself to higher and better and deeper levels not stifling my pain with a drug.I dont tie myself in knots about whether Im an alcoholic or not whether there is any such thing or whether some people chemically process alcohol differently from others.  I can see in my own life history where I learned to view alcohol as a magic potion that could solve my problems and heal my pain so whether or not theres some genetic component thats enough explanation for me as to why I developed the habit in the first place.,stopdrinking,cfw5xhx,1,t5_2s7yr

He has a few friends and a few acquaintances and his long days are spent in a drunks neverending occupation monitoring his own condition.He has been drinking for so many years that he has arrived at that peculiar stage in alcoholism where he no longer drinks to get high or to get drunk. He drinks simply to hold himself together and continue to function. He has a muddled theory that he can even drink himself sober by which he means that he can sometimes find a lucid window through the fog of his life.He is unloved he detests life he is hung over he wants a drink he is startled by sudden movements and loud noises he has no patience for fools everyone is a fool and middleclass morality is a conspiracy against the man who wants to find surcease in alcoholic bliss.Too true..thanks for this!,stopdrinking,cg12060,7,t5_2s7yr

You used almost the exact words that were my moment of clarity  that you dont have to live like this anymore.One morning or afternoon I was supposed to be at school but instead was still wasted sitting on the couch having projectile vomited on myself.  I was sitting in a sun beam.  All of a sudden a mental voice my own voice came through the haze and with great excitement declared in almost disbelief of the simplicity of it I dont have to do this anymore! It was at that moment that two things happened.  Firstly it was the first moment that I realized that I really truly did NOT want to be living like that.  Secondly that it was actually possible that I dolenyoung not only had a chance to get out but damn well could...would even!I had never believed that before.  Id rationalized the lifestyle by trying to convince myself I loved it and on the other side of the fence Id already resigned myself to that being my future even if I didnt like it.What made all the difference in addition to being a spiritual epiphany of courseseriously I felt an otherworldly power at that moment and was at peace...it lasted all day and I was simply euphoric! ...was that no longer was I simply hearing phrases such as you shouldnt do this or have you ever thought of quitting or even if I can do it you can.  It was the realization that I didnt have to keep doing it!  And it was coming...from me!  in your case your dad but the wording was the same it was FREEIING you not making you do a new hard thing!I just hope that everyone who gets an epiphany like this just runs with it you want to get far enough away by the time the euphoria fades so just run and dont look back for a second!,stopdrinking,cg3yf5n,3,t5_2s7yr

Posting to this subreddit was even difficult for me to do. Im glad I found such a welcoming online community though!  I think right now the most effective or least intimidating? strategy is going to decide one day at a time that I am going to be sober today.  And reading what others post in this subreddit.  Hopefully engaging with an online sober community will help me guilt myself into staying sober.Hopefully I get the courage to go to a recovery meeting in my area soon.

Its interesting you said that you feel powerless  many of us are powerless when it comes to alcohol and accepting that is usually a step in the right direction. Its not a moral failing on your part. Its just the nature of this thing.Think about all the things you could do differently this time. I think attending meetings would greatly benefit you doing this alone is way more difficult than it has to be. Its easy to get ahead of yourself with the dating thing but as you said you should get sober and take care of yourself first. Otherwise everything else is likely to fall apart. Girls will be there when you get back on your feet and its not like youre a dinosaur at  anyway lolHonestly if youre certain you dont need the drugs to detox easily maybe thats for the best. Might help you stay sober if you dont want to go through the relative unpleasantness of withdrawals all over again  I know I dont. Of course Id be singing a different tune if you felt like there was any serious danger for you to detox without medicine. If there isnt though go through it. I know for me the desire to not have to go through withdrawal again kept me sober for the first few weeks.I sympathize with your living situation  I live with  stoner dudes Im the only girl  of whom are absolutely out of control alcoholics.

I neglected major tasks and kinda stayed in bed for a few weeks. I didnt drink then because I knew that alcohol wasnt the cure it was the reason I was depressed. I drank for so long that my brain needed alcohol to tell it when to be happy. That phase lasted about  weeks for me. Now Im noticeably happier.

I stopped drinking  years into our marriage and he was respectful enough to keep his own continued use out of our life and home but as you can imagine we both went through many changes in the next decades. This is going to happen to anyone in any circumstance. Sometimes loyalty kept us together sometimes it was just stubbornness. There were definitely times when one or the other wanted to pull the plug. Fortunately never at the same time. My husband stopped drinking nearly  years ago now weve been married since .

I broke out in a cold sweat so that I felt a sheen of perspiration across my brow.  I left the restaurant on a run to my office across the public square.  When I got up to my floor I ran to my office closed the door.  My heart was racing.  The feeling that I would be sucked out of my office and hurled  stories to street caused me to lay down on my carpet and sink my fingers in to the pile of the carpet and cling to it for dear life.

828874,0,t3_23mh68,Im a problem solver. When people tell me theyre having a problem I try to offer a solution.  Its my natural response to that situation.  Problem is often times people arent looking for a solution at all theyre only looking to vent a little.  By offering a solution where none was sought I come off as annoying.  I dont mean to be annoying Im just doing what my instincts tell me Im supposed to do.  Its a personality defect.  I mean well. I dont think its shitty of you to think that way.  Some people offer advice when they have no business in the world doing so.  Im thinking of my twicedivorced occasionally unfaithful friend who cant help but throw in his two cents worth of relationship advice whenever the topic comes up.  I want to say Dude what in the world is wrong in that head of yours that makes you believe your mouth should be in the open position right now?  I mean really dude.  Really.  Really?  But I dont say that.  I know he means well.  I also dont tune out  of what he has to say.  His personal relationship shortcomings not withstanding hes a bright guy who has a lot of great insights.  If nothing else just being a separate standalone human being gives him an outside perspective on any issue that doesnt involve him.  There is value there.  And if anyone knows about making relationship mistakes its him.  I could always do the opposite of what he recommends.  Joking. Sort of.  A big part of making good decisions is learning to solicit advice from a variety of sources and learning how to properly weigh the opinions you receive.  I will often ask a variety of people for their input on different things Im working on.  I consider all of the advice received both alone and in aggregate I weigh it but in the end I still make my own decision.Try to keep it all in perspective.  Everyone giving you advice or encouragement means well.  Even those with screwed up lives have something of value to offer.  You dont have to follow the advice of anyone who offers it.  In fact in many cases that might be a mistake.  Remember in the end your decisions are your decisions.  You get to make them.  Not anyone else.  Youre embarrassed youre remorseful youre angry youre worried about what others might think of you youre scared of the future.  All of that stuff is common.  Its normal to feel those things.  But also notice each of those things is to at least some degree within your own control.   Youre talking your own feelings your own fears your own worries.  I know its not always easy but you can choose stop letting all of that stuff bother you.   You can choose to stop caring what other people think.  You can choose to stop worrying about the future or what might happen and just take it as it comes.  You can assume that everyone has the best of intentions and means no harm.  Even if youre not right about that last one whats it matter?  Its still a happier outlook isnt it?  ,stopdrinking,cgyhtje,4,t5_2s7yr

You can not reason with unreasonable people. I have a friend whos on drugs. Started out with weed went to pills and might be on heroin. Ive begged him to stop. He WAS the smartest and kindest kid I knew. He just doesnt care anymore. He only cares about himself now and getting messed up. He may die a drug addict and there is nothing more I can do. I can only learn not to do the things that he is doing. You said you have a story to tell Im sure you have problems of your own.

Usually what one does is listen to the people at the meetings and if you hear someone that says something that really resonates with you ask them to be your sponsor.  Also they say to pick a sponsor who has the kind of sobriety you want.  So if theres someone who is very peaceful and spiritual and thats what you want get them.  If you are interested in having a big sober social life or someone who has gained material possessions in sobriety get them.  Also you usually pick a sponsor of your same sex assuming your are heterosexual.  I have a male gay friend who sponsors women.

1020382,0,t1_chk92g5,Ironically the righter I feel the angrier I am and that just puts me on shakier ground.  What got me so riled up that I nearly jumped from my chair and sped to the liquor store?  That the universitys lawyers submitted a  page brief which completely ignored the central allegations of my complaint.As an experienced attorney Ive seen things like this.  And occasionally when I find myself with a client whose position is completely unsupported Ive done things like this.  The attorneys realize that there is no defense to the actual claims and evidence Im presenting.  So they are basically tiptoeing around the edges to avoid possibly getting sanctioned later in the case under Rule  which bars attorneys from taking positions that are not legally or factually supported.  Yet they have to move to dismiss my complaint even if theres no grounds because they are hired by the insurance carriers who always expect a prompt motion to dismiss.In this case its pretty extreme.  In fact Im not sure Ive ever seen a case so extreme  its as though defense counsel simply set my complaint aside picked up someone elses complaint about something else and filed a motion to dismiss that.  They are caught in a tough place  one of the reasons why I chose not to practice law anymore.  But again ironically this only reinforces that Im  in the right which makes me angrier.However I am pleased to report that it is now Saturday morning I did not drink and I am preparing to lead a  hour day ride without a hangover.

Just take it one day at a time. Everyday you dont drink and improve your relationship with your family or at least prevent it from getting worse is a step in the right direction.

1090628,0,t3_26lplm,Alcoholism is a genetic disease. It runs in your family and puts you at risk. For that reason alone it is wise to not drink. The amount you drink is not normal and is damaging to the body. It irritates the lining of the intestinal tract hence abdominal distress. Your tolerance is high which is a sign of alcoholism. This is a progressive disease that always gets worse never better. Yes denial is sitting on your shoulder whispering Come follow me   where  you will eventually experience worse consequences. If you were capable of dialing back your drinking you would already be doing it and wouldnt be here. Comparatively you are not a normal drinker. A book which helped me understand alcoholism is Under the Influence by Ketcham and Milam. It might save your life. ,stopdrinking,chs9a1r,3,t5_2s7yr

It definitely has its upsides.  But it just isnt what Ive found works for me.What works for me is to just forget alcohol is even an option.  Order something else.  Find a different addiction diet coke or fitness not heroine or murder.  I had a scary moment last weekend when my roommate was making sausage and I opened a beer to pour in the pan for him.  The noise and smell was so familiar still.  I immediately poured out the access and went upstairs to get my mind away from it.  I cant give alcohol the time or place in my mind.  And AA doesnt facilitate that approach very well in my opinion.Youve got to find what works for you and stick with it.  I think the genuine people in AA would encourage you to do whatever works for you whether or not that happens to be AA.,stopdrinking,chuqck6,5,t5_2s7yr

1134546,0,t3_2749mx,The AA program is set up to help us deal with the past and put it in perspective.  In early recovery I found that things didnt look at all like they really were.  It took some time and some sober living to be able to reflect accurately on my past.  The horrible regret and general depression are a big part of the addiction withdrawl process.  The drunk me inside was very very sad about having no beer and wasnt afraid to rattle the cage by making me miserable.  For me part of the recovery process was realising I was making myself miserable without my consent!!  It takes time to get healthy and put things into perspective.  If you dont drink you will have that time to use profitably toward recovery.  If you work to the best of your ability it will be enough.  I have to remember the urge to drink is THE sign of my illness so is the depression and anxiety and the urge to drink this away is the final proof of my alcoholism.

I know this is heresy but I challenge anyone to provide any concrete scientific evidence. When several people in my IOP group found no evidence in their immediate families to predict their disease the well meaning counselor said Ahhhh but we know that it can skip several generations Well thats convenient! Our theory seems to have holes so keep looking until you find an alcoholic in your genealogy to prove our point! When I raised this issue again the well meaning counselor said sometimes some of our relatives alcoholism went unrecognized! I could use this logic to prove that your broken because witchcraft lurks in you genetic background.I used to work for NIDA and thought I had all of the answers because I did. They were in a three ring binder on my bosses desk and he grabbed them every time he went to testify before state and federal legislatures.I helped analyze reams of data and while AA seemed to be a huge indicator of successful outcomes we could never use those data because the program was full of fuzzy logic and there were no double blind studies. To cite one problem its impossible to track those that stick around those that just use the tools in the book but never go to meetings those that fail etc. and few in the scientific literature would ever touch the DSM V. Hell even my psychiatrists think the DSM is a load of ER bad scienceAs someone who has finally found a working solution in AA I can attest that using science as your ally fails at every turn  assuming you want to use science correctly. Listen to your heart. Do the program if it works but get science the hell out of here....please ,stopdrinking,ci0t143,0,t5_2s7yr

I had to have someone kind of walk me through finding what I enjoyed since it had changed over time.One of the things she had me do is to write of list of everything I currently enjoyed and everything I could think of that sounded like it might be fun.  These list are VERY different from person to person.  Then go over it with a friend or sponsor to see if there is anything on that list you could try or do more of.  Over a period of about six months I took a few different kinds of classes went to some different meet ups and club meetings etc  taking note of what I felt energized and excited duringafter and what I didnt. I surprised myself a whole lot. Some of the things that I thought I would love I was just meh.  And the thing I love the best didnt even show up on the first list because it was so integral to who I am I didnt even notice it.You dont have to take six months or do anything I did but there is some value in evaluating what you enjoy.  Its bound to be different now than it was  days ago because your perspective is so different.I also suggest looking at a thread we did recently here called A Massive List of Fun Things or something to that effect.

Be where you say youll be do what you say youll do. Be transparent. Dont be defensive. You owe her. That being said your wife and the threat of losing her can be a motivating factor in getting sober but staying sober longterm has to be for yourself.

1311454,0,t3_292j4e,Okay this might sounds odd saying this straightaway but every time I read your posts I get excited for you. Your story and path so far has been very similar to my own. I see you coming to the same realizations and revelations that I did and youre thinking about what to do about them instead of just saying It is what it is. Growth is like peeling and onion. You started by peeling off that dry husk on the outside  the you that was a drinker  and youve started peeling away the layers beneath. It may be hard and there may be tears but youre working at getting to the middle... the core REAL you.There are lots of great suggestions and thoughts here in response to your post. What helped me identify all those things that you are starting to become aware of was working the th and th steps in AA. I found out that fear was basically at the root of all my issues. For me that realization was enough for me to be able to take daily steps to address that habitual behavior brought on from that fear...kind of following the symptoms back to the root problem. Being honest with myself and others has been essential to this process. I learned how to do this by watching and listening to others in meetings and then by sharing myself. A therapist can accomplish the same  a safe place to expose your vulnerabilities  but theres something about being in a room full of others that really get it that makes it that much easier to be completely  honest...even more so than you might with just yourself. Kind of like what its like sharing here but I feel I grow more doing it in person because thats where I live....out there in the real world. Keep growing my friend. There is so much more wonder and beauty ahead for you on this path. ,stopdrinking,cih5lis,2,t5_2s7yr

My point is that defects should not be ranked using some kind of cosmic scorecard. Trying to figure if a slip is better or worst than a flirt will not build anything.

Your health and your daughters should be most important to you. If you focus on yourself and your daughter on getting healthy it will leave your husband a choice to either contribute to the situation or to not.gt He doesnt want to give up on our marriage or anything but this is crippling.This is how I used to feel about my SO. She wasnt a bad person and she wasnt any less loving but we were in an unhealthy situation that we BOTH created. Ultimately it took a short period of time apart and for us to consciously work on our relationship and the way we treated each other to fix things. I also think educating your husband on what it is like to become sober is like. My SO and I had huge problems seeing eye to eye on how hard it is to become sober until she went to an AA meeting. After that she was much more compassionate and understanding and she was able to support me better.

If you believe you are at the top of the food chain  that YOU are the greatest power in the universe then the steps probably wouldnt work for you.However I think what you meant by your question is How does AA accommodate those of us who do not believe in a supernatural God? In this case AA DOES accommodate for those who dont believe in a supernatural being I count myself as one of those who dont believe in a supernatural God. AA allows you to pick a higher power of your understanding. For a lot of people that can mean the collective of AA  the collective efforts of those trying to stay sober  is a power greater than oneself. So to recap you dont have to believe in anything supernatural. You just have to believe that you arent God and that perhaps others can show you a better way to live.Clear as mud right? ,stopdrinking,cinfdhe,1,t5_2s7yr

1395313,0,t1_cir44ou,Oh my god.... I remember all that extra time at the beginning! I was scared to just sit there that I would end up having a craving so I kept myself busy until I dropped into bed each night. I was pretty ritualistic about it too. As soon as I got home when I would normally start drinking I took the dog for a walk for about  minutes. Then I would make dinner and eat then then I would do ANYTHING to stay busy.  Cleaned the house from top to bottom rearranged every drawer every closest bathed and groomed all the animals groomed myself etc. At pm every night I would pop myself some popcorn and make some tea and settle down for the night. Same time every night.Eventually I did marathon Netflix binges rewatching shows I had forgotten while drinking. Then I found this place and read tons. Started going to a painting class on Mondays AA meeting on Tuesdays yoga on Wednesdays.

I will say that it is a very liberating moment when you are comfortable just saying I was starting to have a problem so Im laying off for the foreseeable future. The first time outside of an AA meeting that I said Im an alcoholic was a big weight lifted. How the person reacts to this knowledge is a mirror of how comfortable you are saying it. If you are visibly uncomfortable talking about it they will be too. If the reaction you desire is good for you how do they get to that reaction from you? I have found that if someone keeps on the with questions  more often than not they are doing recon for their own habits. You never know if your being candid about it will make it easier for them to get or ask for help when and if they need it.

1414547,0,t3_2acaer,These are drinking dreams and I think that not a week goes by that there arent  or  posts asking about or venting about the experience.  Within the last year I really changed my opinion about drinking dreamsmost scientists believe that dreams are substantially meaningless random neurons firing during REM sleep.  I used to believe this and that the only thing of significance is what narrative we impress on the experience i.e. dont drink because you dreamed that you drank is still a pretty solid bit of advice.  But then I heard episode of Radiolab about the Harvard professor who conducted research on his hypothesis that dreams can play a role in problem solving which he experimentally confirmed studying Tetris video gamers and a control group.  Extrapolated from  Professor Stickgolds findings I now suspect that our nervous system habituated to being overdosed with alcohol may be trying to get us to turn the onoff switch back to on and feed it alcohol using drinking dreams.  Not surprisingly around the time that the phenomena of cravings subside so do drinking dreams.  ,stopdrinking,citlc8q,3,t5_2s7yr

Forget the higher power and holding hands BS and just go try it out. It might be for you it might not but either way youll see how hard people work to get sober and what a support system really is which is worth it in and of itself.

Theres also SMART meetings for another option.Read as much as you can on this sub even go years back.

There is a alcohol assessment quiz on the sidebar that takes less than  minutes to take and know the result.  This is what i did to stop drinking and get sober see if you can avail yourself of any of this it might help. Right from the first day and every day after at the moment when I first get up in fact when my eyes openI make a conscious and deliberate daily decision not to drink alcohol TODAY and today onlyall day no matter what happens good or bad. When I say this I am actually suggesting a PHYSICAL RITUAL that I incorporate into every morning when I wake up.. I go to AA meetings and I went to  meetings in  days at the outset because my AA sponsor suggested that I would do best if I learned to follow directions and that was his first direction..  Tomorrow I repeat.In the early days sober just getting to bed without any alcohol was a sober victory. Tough it out no matter what.

Im thinking about drugs which are acutely drinking relatedI was planning to ask my doctor about antabuse in particular although Ive heard about various drugs to help with cravings but dont know much about them. The idea that I might be able to prevent myself from wanting the drink is appealing but its not easy to really wrap my head around what that means. It does seem like a softer path than antabuse but being soft on myself may not be the best thing for me right now.Thank you also for the reminder about honesty. Ive stood in front of enough doctors and therapists and told my story honestly that I think I can manage it although honesty has also been my biggest failing with therapy in the longer term. Of course it all starts with lying to myself it was just one little slip not a big deal. Ill get back on the wagon tomorrow...Giving myself time to dry out before this appointment is unfortunately not an option. Look at me using my latest effort toward recovery as an excuse to drink!

This afternoon Im going to walk to the bookstore and spend some time by myself just browsing and remembering what it was like to be alone without needing to go to a restaurant and get a glass of wine because its such a nice day out and it would be wonderful to enjoy a glass of wine on the patio or go get a bottle of wine to drink tonight because its Saturday. So many feeble excuses. I took a good hard look at myself in the gym mirror this morning and its incredible what you can overlook when youre in denial about yourself and your life.

If you are anything like me in the months years before I stopped drinking I bombarded my body and brain with alcohol and really screwed up my sleep routine.  As I got sober I have to anticipate a time for recovery.  This happens but its not instantaneous it takes some time and dogged persistence to stay sober and not kindle withdrawal symptoms.  Finally work at it a little.  Pay attention to when your tired.  Listen to relaxing music at a reasonable volume and go to sleep.  Get in a pattern of sleeping and waking up at normal hours.  Cut out caffeine from all sources after  PM.  And it will happen.  ,stopdrinking,cjqxuse,3,t5_2s7yr

We can laugh at those who think spirituality the way of weakness. Paradoxically it is the way of strength. The verdict of the ages is that faith means courage. All men of faith have courage. They trust their God. We never apologize for God. Instead we let Him demonstrate through us what He can do. We ask Him to remove our fear and direct our attention to what He would have us be. At once we commence to outgrow fear.A.A. World Services Inc . Alcoholics Anonymous th EditionIf that sounds like something you want to learn more about get the book.

1750635,0,t3_2eieg0,I had my first blackout when I was  which was when I first got into drinking properly.  We were at a rugby club party in a night club.. the last thing I remember is being sick on a table and it dripping off onto the dance floor.. yuck.  I assumed Id just passed out.But then the police called and asked me to come in for questioning.  Apparently my friend had left the club and been sick on a policemans shoes well presumably just splatter and that hed been taken to hospital for the night.  He didnt have his stomach pumped but only because he was so freely being sick.  So the police took the club to court and my friend and I had to go to court as witnesses which was awful.  Then the club was closed down.I thought that was the end of it.  But then back at college some guy is constantly giving me evils and I dont know why.  He was in the same class as one of my friends and my friend had said that hed been asking all about me.  Eventually he confronts me in the street saying that Id been really hands on I forget how he phrased it with his girlfriend in the club that night.  He was shaking with anger I had accepted the inevitable punch to the face.. but it never came.  I explained that this was completely and utterly out of character I had no memory of it about going to court and how sorry I was.  He was a good person that day and gave me a break when perhaps he shouldnt.It was the first of many blackouts.  Looking back I mark that night out as the start of my alcoholism proper.If youre looking to getting fit which I did too I would highly recommend the Couch to K programme.

1786957,0,t3_2exkyy,We ALL make mistakes. Every one of us. We sometimes make the same mistake more than once. Thats OK too. I think as much as you dont to you should probably get out and find some friends. Your friends are your friends and shouldnt care if you got a DUI or even two DUIs. I think theyd be more understanding if you explained this story to them.I thought I was just the college drinker too until I realized that drinking not only is awesome for partying and forgetting stuff but it also helped ease my loneliness because I would forget that too at least temporarily. Its only gotten worse for me the last couple years because I occasionally use booze to cure the shitty feeling hangover from the night before which just ends up delaying my current hangover until a new one happens. Gotta love binge drinking. And like you booze has made me handle bad situations poorly. Anyways be thankful for your parents and your dog. Sometimes not all of us even have them to support us. I feel very fortunate that yes my parents get mad when I choose to forget by drinking but they understand to a degree and have been there to help me get back up on my feet many times. Dont give up and keep going! I hope you get your license back and everything turns around for you,stopdrinking,ck4ecx5,1,t5_2s7yr

1818287,0,t3_2fd0np,For me the alcohol problems started right away. I cannot remember ever drinking like a normal person right from the start. So I dont have a lot of advice other than make sure that alcohol isnt always a part of everything you do. Because if you drink every time theres any opportunity to do so youll miss out on the chance to learn and grow as a sober person. Over time I became dependent on alcohol as a social crutch. When I socialize without alcohol and also now that Ive cut down I find that Im not able to carry on a basic friendly conversation without feeling very selfconscious.

1892459,0,t3_2g7tyn,Way to go!This is a wildly interesting subject in part because the best data collected happens to be by the Euopeans who are having better luck with moderation approaches than abstinence.I initially thought I would do inpatient detox followed by a brief stint of abstinence followed by moderation. So far Im loving the abstinence part and hope to continue this pathway for the future with the long term  years vision for eventual moderation. Oddly the thought of eventual moderation seems to be helping with my success at abstinence. It sounds unintuitive but I think its helpful because it tempers the anxiety brought about by the idea that this is it forever! I will never drink again!!!For me I sure hope to be able to drink again gives me the freedom to explore abstinence on MY TERMS and not those of an ideological or almost religious perspective. I suspect that this freedom is likely going to result in permanent abstinence which is one successful outcome!Keep it up!,stopdrinking,ckh8dhr,3,t5_2s7yr

I wanted to be cool impressive and liked. The aims of my actions had the absolute opposite effect.I dont feel any of those actually led to anything good in my life and actually made me look kind of pathetic.Now Ive realised some of my triggers  embarrassing as I find them  I can work on me in a more positive rounded way.

One thing that helped me was reading Allen Carrs book in the sidebar.  Among other things the book helped me see wine as rotten grape juice.  Why drink something that has already spoiled.  There are sparkling and nonsparkling grape juices out there that taste better frankly.And for me after a while I stopped caring about what I was drinking.  For a bit I was bringing root beer or grape juice or something else with me where ever we went to try to make sure that I had something interesting to drink.

I had to reach my bottom  years later to come back of my own accord. By then I was a grumpy old man and the rooms were full of happy young people half of them women. Dammit all. ACA back in the day was nothing like it is now. They have the big red book now and it is legit. And at least here the meetings are mostly women. Even AA has ladys only meetings. Ive heard women in my home group obviously a mixed gender group share stories very much like yours. Sure th stepping still happens but I would like to think that you could find other women to fellowship with. All of that said I am not working ACA as is advised. I have to do that whole Easy Does It thing. As I am both the child of and parent they got me coming and going so I have to do it in small doses to avoid overload. Get the Big Red Book and read it in small doses on your own? Find a fellow traveler to talk with about it? Do meetings later if at all? Ive had a few breakthroughs in ACA that are turning my life around. I am learning to recognize the critical parent voice that tells me that I suck. I can then tell that critical parent where to stick it. I am learning how to convince  year old me that I am safe and loved. I take him out to have fun and play and sometimes I help him stay home to cuddle the kitty and rest. I hope you can do the same for your inner child.

1935552,0,t3_2gt0x8,Think about the amount of alcohol youve consumed in the last ten years. If  days is the longest youve gone without a drink in that time then you havent really given your body and nervous system much of a chance to recover. Processing alcohol takes a toll on your body even though youve been able to pretty much keep functioning your body and brain have been suffering. Repairing that sort of damage is not going to happen in a week or two although the body is amazingly resilient and it will repair a lot of the damage given time sleep exercise and good nutrition. Give yourself a chance to feel the benefits before you call it quits. ,stopdrinking,ckmf7b6,1,t5_2s7yr

Turns out it is just dancing with way less drunken foolishness lapses in judgement overspending at the bar embarrassing falling down and a lot more remembering what happened and being glad that I could remember because I did nothing that I did not want to remember. You will have a great time. If your friends are normies they may not even notice that you are not drinking. If they drink like I did your sobriety may threaten their denial of their own problems. Advice  Have your own transportation so you can leave when you want to. Have phone numbers of support group people you can call. Maybe even talk to one of them before and agree to talk with them after to check in.  Talk to your bartender or wait staff on the side if possible.

That was quite a wake up call and dang was I ashamed. Your friend might not be too surprised that you had a problem. Plus you know what we all grow up and outgrow previous bad habits... Your friend may just be really cool and supportive about it. Mine were. My explanation was simple Im focusing on getting healthier now. Others  acquaintances  didnt even carenotice.Initial strategies that worked were just to have a drink in hand any non alky drink. Diet coke throw in a maraschino cherry sweet tea twist of lemon or orange half seltzer half cranberry juice... Or I did overpriced designer froofroo hipster sodas on occasion. Youve got this!

2116189,0,t3_2j61db,I have  almost  years sober through AA. I was a Navy ET which had a minimum requirement of a Secret clearance. Id gotten in trouble with drinking and requested help through rehabilitation. At that time there were no adverse effects to my clearance. I was warned however that if I was to get into another alcoholrelated incident that it would cost me my clearance. Personally I drank immediately after rehab and when my superiors got tired of giving me chances my clearance was stripped and I was separated from the military.The important thing here is that youre making this decision for yourself without having to tell anyone about it. That probably rolls to your advantage. The next thing is to be careful of your references when you have to update your clearance. As far as I know its leniant if you dont get in any documented trouble. If you went to AA as a personal decision I dont see why youd have to mention it to anyone. Like I said this is something they may ask your references but your old drinking buddies arent a good idea for refs anyway.,stopdrinking,cl8tb21,3,t5_2s7yr

2136205,0,t1_clbbxlz,Protected term.  means that it cant be claimed without authority. Specifically you cannot legally diagnose medical conditions. Sure most people can recognize a broken bone but some things are more nuanced. Alcoholism used to be a Medical protected term one that defined specifically a person who was physically dependent on alcohol.  This protection was removed by the WHO in favor of alcohol dependence syndrome. now alcoholism is AFAIK roughly defined as someone who has or might consume  units of alcohol a day.  Sure I can have three drinks and live an entirely normal healthy life but does that make me an alcoholic? I dont think so and so I think the term is used too liberally.   So my issue is that so many people now fall under a term that was once reserved for people who were so dependent on alcohol that missing a drink might trigger a lethal withdrawal.  My family still has living memory of grandparents aunts and one cousin who still lives who were that dependent so the term carries a lot of weight with me and I feel its tossed around too easily.  Yes alcohol can ruin lives but too many people claim to be alcoholics when really they should just say they have trouble with drinking.  You and I both know that one beer can be enjoyed but how often does someone who enjoys their drink have just one?   ,stopdrinking,clbcwzy,1,t5_2s7yr

He is quite knowledgeable and has helped many in my family.From the doctors perspective I think he simply gave me textbook advice it didnt work out for me but it wasnt totally wrong. I should have had frequent follow ups then the real problem would be exposed and he could properly diagnose alcoholism. I think that it is important to doctors to act on fact and not emotion so I dont blame him. I can wish things had gone differently but the medical world is technical and often relies on things that can be quantified. I could have told him I drink  beer a year but he wouldnt have been able to tell unless I had consistent blood work.,stopdrinking,clcg2r4,1,t5_2s7yr

2177146,0,t1_clgk6pb,If you could control your drinking i.e. cut back you would have already done it and would not be here. The only requirement for AA is a desire to stop drinking. It offers wonderful support and sober living tools. Im an atheist and managed to the the godstuff slide off. AA is not a religious program. Some people have a god who helps them so be it. I dont. And thats ok. Heck if you go to AA theres nothing stopping you from drinking is there? Obviously you know your thinking is being controlled by the evil troll alcoholism. I got medical help. Then went to treatment then AA and got a therapist. It worked for me. You can go to an AA meeting and check it out. Its not a club or a lifetime commitment. I stayed sober one hour one morning one day at a time. Today is all we have. Your family deserves a sober husband and father. I had an alcoholic dad. Please dont be one.

2231539,0,t3_2kpb8q,Based both on my own experience and research Ive conducted quitting drinking doesnt have too much to do with your weight longterm.  Weight is mostly calories incalories out.  So some people had a drastic overage of calories from drinking beer for instance and then they quit beer dont change any of their other habits and lose weight.  Others replace the beer with soda or chocolate and so their total calories dont really change.  Still others were replacing meals with booze and so they actually were on the low calorie side and so gain weight due to actually eating meals again.The thing is alcohol is empty calories. It doesnt give the body any nutrition.  So no matter what if a person is drinking too much and getting the majority of their calories from empty calories they are going to be unhealthy whether they are overweight or not.  Since overall health was my goal and factored into my choice a lot I had already quit sugar and was watching what I ate.  So when I quit drinking I didnt let myself change that.  No replacing booze with sugar. I had also read that drinking can deplete your body of nutrients so I focused on eating as many nutrientdense foods as I could to help my body repair.  So far it seems to be working.  My weight loss actually sped up the first week I quit drinking and my skin is clearing up and glowing and I have more energy.  TLDR It takes more than just quitting drinking to be healthy but quitting drinking is an excellent step and its best to focus on one step at a time.    ,stopdrinking,clnhcth,2,t5_2s7yr

If hes unable to take direction for the early stuff theres no way hell hang in there for the tough stuff.

2355971,0,t3_2mca04,Hi there friend. Yup alcoholism is a bith. What you are feeling is understandable given what youre going through. A breakup is like a death. It is painful. This was an important relationship and you will never forget it. But you will heal in time. You are going through the early stages of grief. Hopefully it will comfort your to know that alcoholism does not hang over my shoulder every day waiting to pounce. Still I am aware that I have this disease and never minimize the power of alcohol. But it will not always feel quite as cunning baffling powerful as it does now. It sounds like you are doing all the right things. I cant remember...did you ever get a sponsor? It would surely be helpful to have someone now. Any candidates?Im sorry for your loss. Sink into the pain once in awhile. That may sound strange but I liken it to dipping your toe into hot or cold water. When were sober we can pull our foot out when it gets to be too much. Thats the modicum of control that sobriety provides. Im blabbering. Its always good to hear from you. You express your feelings so openly and honestly and its refreshing. Not that hearing this is much comfort. Im sorry youre hurting. ,stopdrinking,cm2wqk9,4,t5_2s7yr

I was in AA for a reasonable amount of time and there were things about the program I found unhelpful although these things may be helpful to other people. For instance I believe that the labels I apply to myself will always limit me in some way and the idea of being a recovering alcoholic limited me. Mind you Im not sure that the original members of AA meant for people to still consider themselves as recovering alcoholics? The thing I found least helpful about AA was the idea that I belonged to a special group  I  didnt have problems I had special alcoholic problems.You are right that we can all take our recovery path too seriously and it is human nature to want to belong to the group that is right. ,stopdrinking,cmu7tge,8,t5_2s7yr

2616362,0,t1_cmzplje,Well done you for telling your Mum. OK she doesnt quite get it. The term alcoholic means different things to different people. All you really need to tell your family is that alcohol is having a negative effect on your health and lifestyle and you cant drink anymore. Just because it is a past time in your family doesnt mean that you are obligated to drink as well. Also often the thought of not fitting in without alcohol is actually very different in reality. I can tell you from experience that you can actually have a very good time at a party not drinking and most people wont care or even notice after a while that you are not. If you are worried about your social skill set without alcohol and are uncomfortable just ask every one you speak to about what they are doing. People love to talk about themselves and it takes the pressure off you.Either way you are going to need to find a group of like minded sober friends whether that means moving or not. Just remember just because you move away does not necessarily mean you leave all your troubles and issues behind. Stay strong. ,stopdrinking,cn03hy5,1,t5_2s7yr

This time it will be different! It wasnt as bad as I think it was! It took me many tries to realize that no matter how I rationalized it I was going to regret drinking.For support and reminders I recommend  sticking close to this sub.

2679770,0,t3_2qph90,This reminds me of a slightly reverse story from last Christmas.  My parents know I always drank but they had no idea the extent.  They always felt I would go on occasional benders but they didnt know that my life basically was one.  Anyway for several years every Christmas I made eggnog.  The good time consuming stuff.  I would make multiple batches with and without alcohol.  The last few years I would get the bottle of bourbon for the eggnog then nip at it after making the eggnog.  My parents didnt really say anything because I would not drink the whole thing but I could tell it bothered them.  I guess last year they had enough and were starting to see my drinking was much worse.  I came down from upstairs at am after they were passed out for a couple shots and got a mouth full of vinegar.  They had replaced the remainder of the bourbon with some kind of brown vinegar.  I was so damn angry it took everything in me not to say anything the next morning.  I realized if I said a word about it that it would have confirmed their suspicions and they would have won.Glad this year is a better year.,stopdrinking,cn8d7m9,8,t5_2s7yr

Theres no real easy fix you have to stop drinking and break those associations.  Youre still going to have to cook your kids dinner and do normal everyday things that youve associated with drinking.  You can certainly try changing the routine when possible to make it easier. It may be a good idea to see your doctor especially if you have any physical dependence ie if you have withdrawal symptoms. Id also suggest trying AA. ,stopdrinking,cn9xhb5,2,t5_2s7yr

2826359,0,t1_cnokhcw,Ive recently burned at least two friendship bridges before theyd even been built through trauma bonding. Its super awkward now as I run into these people on a regular basis and the foundation we laid of being mired in shit just doesnt lend itself to getting silly and fun.It hurts and its okay and being hurt can throw off all sorts of good habits and modes of thinking weve been trying to build.

2871322,0,t3_2szkp8,Staying out of slippery places is a key component of early sobriety and later too truth be told. Ive seen a lot of posts lately where the poster has a couple of weeks or months and brags that he hasnt changed any of his social habits still goes out with friends to barsthe usual. Ive given up on commenting on those posts as Ben Franklin said Experience is a dear teacher but fools will learn at no other. I just hope they get back as soon as possible once the inevitable happens.I did the same in my early early sobriety. My latersponsor told me that one night I would have an urge to drink so strong that I would not be able to resist it and that if I were in a bar when the urge hit the odds were overwhelming that I would give in and drink. I laughed it off after all I had  days and knew everything there was to know about staying sober.Needless to say that night came. I was leaning against a bar and watched the bartender pour a straightup double shot of Johnny Walker Red Label my favorite. All of a sudden I knew that if I stayed there one more minute I would order myself one. I bumped into a couple of people running out that door and I didnt even apologize I was so terrified that I would be sucked back into that hell I had just gotten out of. I went to the meeting the next night much chastened and shared my experience. It was a long long time before I went into a bar again. For some strange reason none of my bar friends I thought so much of ever called or came by to say how much they missed me.,stopdrinking,cnugxln,15,t5_2s7yr

I relapsed more than Id like to admit because all the stuff I kept locked down all of a sudden came rushing in once I had some sober time. For me Ive found that the first thing was to not drink the second was to find a way to dealcope with all the new and old emotions. Therapy church etc.. can work wonders. One of the reasons I support and participate in AA is because the program deals with all the past damage emotions and helps you set your house in order. I dont know enough about S.M.A.R.T. but I believe its similar. If youre up for it I suggest you check out a few meetings. Stay strong and stick it out!

2939877,0,t3_2tt7cd,Easy  these days I basically only go to social events where I want to interact with the people there.   Im quite introverted but like all introverts there are people I truly want to talk to  just not as many as extroverts and maybe for not as long.   I skip  out of  social events and everyone is happier about it.When I was drinking Id hear that my sister was having a cookout and Id think Great!  An excuse to drink!   And oh yeah be social!    And Id have three beers before I went seven beers at the cookout and halfway through  Id be doing the math and planning my exit so I could drink more.   Id do this while the booze numbed me enough to talk to people.  This was my social lubricant.   It was horrifying.You know what?   I dont like my sisters cookouts.   I have little in common with her or her acquaintances.   I see her twice a year otherwise and thats plenty to catch up with each other.  Its better to see each other less often because then we have something to talk about.For the events that I do want to go to because I actually have something I want to say and want to hear I can do these fine while sober.  TL DR  being sober frees me from faking interest in certain social events that arent for me.   It is winwin all around.,stopdrinking,co29z3h,4,t5_2s7yr

My liver damage was notable but it didnt reach cirrhosis and its been getting better and better and better. Anything short of cirrhosis will almost certainly improve over time. Our livers are much more resilient than most organs.VERY IMPORTANT ADVICE Do NOT take tylenol or anything with acetaminophen until youve had a liver function test and had it okayed by your doctor. People with liver damage can easily die of amounts of acetaminophen that would not harm people with healthy livers.  ,stopdrinking,co99h3g,1,t5_2s7yr

So I mean yeah what I was sentenced with had quite a bit to do with my career and financial situation.  Im not advocating getting out of it but if one has taken responsibility and has taken steps to get sober begin recovery do whatever it takes to ensure this sort of thing never happens again...whats the point in having the court put more obstacles in their path?  I am saying that if someone has made this horrible mistake and is confronting their problem and seeking help the court system will more than likely make things much harder for the person to dig themselves out of the hole their substance abuse issue has created.

He wasnt interested in hearing at first because why should this time be any different than all the other times Ive tried to quit. I let him be for awhile but he saw the commitment I had this time.

3109310,0,t3_2vrgyo,For me the big eye opener was how many calories I was drinking every night. I started using my fitness pal and realized that I do eat pretty healthily but then throw that out every night when I start drinking. I tried switching from beer to wine nope still a shit ton of calories. Liquor well thats just pure sugar. So even though I was working out   or  times a week I couldnt lose my belly fat. Then I quit. I lost almost ten pounds in a week and I was working out less. Its a very valid reason to quit drinking and no one at AA would judge you for it. If they do you need to find another meeting but I highly doubt it would happen. I personally dont like AA and use this sub for support that seems to work pretty well.

3116672,0,t1_col1ahm,thanks. indeed it is and its frustrating how the family refuses to acknowledge that going out for a drink is probably the number  activity for people after work on a friday night. alcohol has been an integral part of human culture for thousands of years. it really is a big effing deal to give it up. but normies just wont get it. whatever.as for sober activities my job happens to involve writing so its easier for me to sit at a cafe for hours with my laptop sometimes working sometimes playing crusader kings and sometimes watching films. but for group activites well people around me keep recommending cooking classes or dancing lessons and i say unto them FCK YOU! because seriously what something does that stuff outside of romcoms? now im at a point that hanging out in a barclub really is no big deal !!not recommended at earlier phases of sobriety!! but the problem there isnt that im tempted its that i get bored. its hard to dance to nicki minaj and stuff while sober. i guess sports could be the answer if youre the type or even if you arent actually it can become a positive addiction and you get to look good.gym buddies tend to be health nuts eating egg whites and stuff so you might hang out with them doing sober stuff. feel free to check out AA as an atheist i grew out of it and i dont have any secular sobriety groups in my area but its a good start to see what people actually do with their time amp meet some fellow travellers. young sober people who are not amish do exist. ours is a heavy cross to bear but its worth it. good luck man. ,stopdrinking,col1jku,2,t5_2s7yr

3146144,0,t1_coo37lb,Your response brought up another point if you dont mind my going on hereIf you have a parent who is an alcoholic there is likely a good chance that there is a genetic marker of some type in your family that may predispose certain people to the disease.  Lets assume you dont have it.  It doesnt mean that you havent passed along to your daughter right?So your decision now although involuntary to become sober gives you the opportunity to raise your daughter in a world where she can learn from the most important person in her life that alcohol is not needed to have fun to relax to unwind from a hard day or any other things we use alcohol for.  Many children learn their behavior from their parents.  You have this amazing chance with a newborn to teach her a life that doesnt revolve around alcohol.  And if she happens to have that genetic marker you just might be helping her to develop skills and tools to avoid dependency should she decide to drink some day.I dont know but this sounds pretty cool to me.... ,stopdrinking,coo3eu1,3,t5_2s7yr

3146412,0,t3_2w6ws5,gt But I see people with  days doling out sage wisdom to people are in their second day of being dry. Maybe Im really cynical but its laughable at points.SD is a peer to peer support group.  Thats how and why it works. People do not come here to worship at the throne of the selfproclaimed sobriety gods. They come here to make a connection with people who are going through the same things they are.  They could get advice out of a book.  They dont they come here instead.  Theres a reason for that.  Theyre notsomuch looking for the answer. Theyre looking for people to tell them that everythings going to be OK.  gt Im NOT an expertI find it hard to believe that someone who honestly believes that theyre not an expert would call advice coming from others with a smaller number after their name laughable.  Its also hard for me to fathom how someone who uses terms like ESH and advertises themselves as a daily meeting goer  can say with a straight face nor am I a Big Book thumper... Heres whats laughable  You showing up here asking this question as if you mean well when in reality all youre doing is putting everyone down while building yourself up. You wanted a platform to stand on while you declared everyone here is doing everything wrong.  And you have it for now. Im not sure how much longer this post is going to stay active.  If every single person with more than  days of sobriety were to disappear today this sub would continue on just fine.  It would continue to help people get sober.  If every single nb were to disappear though it would be nothing more than a bunch of bozos yammering on about how smart they are patting each other on the back while helping absolutely no one.  The answers to all your questions are in the survey linked in the sidebar.  Fewer than  of people here use AA.  The majority of people here are nbs.  Most of them dont make it to  days sober.  Thats not because of the SD model thats the nature of addiction.  We catch people at an earlier point in the process than your typical reallife support group.  There is a much lower barrier to entry.  Its easy to talk to sobriety to people who are already sober.  If youre here because you want to feel good about spreading your ESH this sub probably isnt the sub for you.  This sub is the front lines.  Its not for everyone.,stopdrinking,coo4esd,27,t5_2s7yr

Hey Im usually giving people advice so I cant use that username to say Im struggling.That sort of thing pisses me off. And it happens here all the freaking time.

3208332,0,t3_2wvnkn,Congratulations to you! One year is a real accomplishment you rightfully should be proud of.Finding support as uSOmuchlearn has suggested was my initial thought as well. At a year I dont think sobriety is your problem. Not drinking got you through your alcohol problem but different methods need to be used to get through the other issues you bring up anxiety possible depression? lack of social group.I think many people go through the same realization you do that although alcohol makes life much more manageable its not the cureall. What sets you apart from many however is that despite feeling let down by the less extreme changes quitting brought you you recognize theres still more to be done on your part to achieve your goals. Its my opinion that the people whose entire lives were changed by quitting drinking actually put in a lot more work in other areas than they realize or let on. That or didnt have any other prominent issues beforehand.Its a difficult and complex process to satisfy your potential and achieve peace which is why I seconded therapy andor finding a social group AA or even rstopdrinking being the recommendation because of the common interest of these groups. Just keep an honest eye on your thoughts and feelings. Also be open to positive suggestions  to get new results more than likely we have to try new methods. This is usually uncomfortable but its good to be uncomfortable sometimes.Thanks for you post it really helped me to think of my own problems sitting on the back burner.

3212025,0,t3_2wvnkn,Great post. One year is a major life accomplishment. You have every right to be proud there are a helluva lot of people out there that would like to know how you cracked the code.I relate so much to your issues. With your wife my experience is similar. I wish my wife would show more pride in my quitting and be more supportive I try to remember that she was on the receiving end of me at my worst. She got hurt and I put her through a lot. Shes probably also nervous that I will start up again. I try to remember that my hurt feelings about her lack of outward support may be just my messed up wiring. She stuck around right? I think it takes a lot of time.The friends thing too... I have no idea what to do. The number of drinkers far out numbers the no drinkers. I dont want to select friends soley from a non drinking crowd because thats pretty limiting. On the other hand I see my friends slip away. I cant get the energy to care though. After a certain point every time we go out I am ready to bail out because it just gets dumb and redundant. Drunks closetalking me with wine stained teeth spitting in my face while they talk. It gets old! But I dont want to join a church group either. This is one where I am just going to try to have these guys be my friends on my terms and Ive got to be fine with that. I often feel like throught this sobriety I have learned a lot that I want to share. Not all great stuff just a lot of unexpected realities. For example I did not think that quitting drinking would result in me questioning the realness of friendships with guys I consider my brothers. Friends Ive had for  years! Maybe you could get some satisfaction from using your experience to help others. Youve earned that right.Congrats again and good luck in year .,stopdrinking,couxdf9,2,t5_2s7yr

3224801,0,t3_2x28s6,Im in a very similar position. f worked in the service industry for  years. I have issues with binge drinking especially if not always with my coworkers. Honestly the service industry is almost like a trap if you have any kind of substance abuse problem. Ive seen a lot of people come and go at the place I work at.. and Ive seen a lot of people who DIDNT have a problem that were fine moved on at whatever point. Our core staff right now though that have been there for a couple years all have issues with substance abuse. There is not a single long term front of house employee who isnt an alcoholic or drug addict. And I dont think this is abnormal at all for the service industry.You can make a lot of money but the hours tend to isolate you from other people. It can be really stressful at times. Youre not only working in an industry that normalizes drinking but youre working in an industry that actively promotes drinking. And youre usually working with at least a couple people who are looking to normalize their alcoholism or drug abuse.If you think that you have a drinking problem and you have any way out of the service industry I would say take it. I know that its a pay cut. If youre a good server you can make ridiculous amounts of money. Ive made a ton of money in the past couple years. I have some saved but to be honest most of it has gone to facilitating a party girl lifestyle. If I worked somewhere else for a  pay cut I would probably have just as much money saved and I would probably be a happierhealthier person too. Not to say it isnt doable to be sober in the industry. Its just that the hours that you have really limit you friendships to people who are working the same type of job and are generally going out and drinking all the time. I think its a million times harder to start sobriety in this kind of job.,stopdrinking,cow960i,1,t5_2s7yr

3233374,0,t1_cox1m4m,I do have a plan although it is going to require a lot of vigilance.  I realized last week that even though I have a ridiculously busy schedule there are too many activities that dont preclude the use of alcohol either during the activity or before.  So for the past week I have been hyperscheduling my days to keep them filled with activities that are incompatible with drinking.  So I cant set aside time to sit and grade papers unless after that I am required to drive somewhere because otherwise the grading papers alone would not preclude the use of alcohol.  I would like to get caught up on some television but sitting in front of the television is a trap for me unless I plan to run an errand after.  I am exhausted to be honest but as a creature of habit I am hopeful that once my default changes from drinking to not drinking I wont have to schedule out every single hour.  But for now I am just keeping my days and evenings filled with activities that are incompatible with alcohol.  It is becoming my norm to not drink which is the first step.  ,stopdrinking,cox58by,1,t5_2s7yr

I have asked him not to bring alcohol home or keep it in the house because Im just not ready for that stress and temptation. I was a drinker who would drink whatever was around especially towards the end and I always knew exactly what we had on hand.I feel like as I get more secure in my sobriety I might be able to have beers in the fridge or people over for dinner who drink wine but right now I need my house to be my refuge.

There are a lot of atheists as well as religious people in AA but I think the most important piece of AA is talking to fellow human beings who share your problem. And whenever I see god in AA literature I just replace it with what my god not a person or higher power is which is my willingness for sobriety my goals and aspirations my family and friends music cycling etc. The list goes on.

3270175,0,t3_2xkqdw,For me the strong urges to drink that came in the beginning were emotional as opposed to physical. I drank because I couldnt stand myself and being sober in my own company was like torture sometimes. I knew those urges wouldnt go away until I did some work on myself  a project I got started on pretty quickly because I simply couldnt stand myself without booze.For me it was around Steps  in the Step program which I would sum up as basically forcing myself to come to terms with and take responsibility for all the shit about me that I drank to avoid facing where the urges started going away. It was a pretty huge relief.I dont know if youve checked it out already but this book really helped me  I think of it as an improvemyselfsoI canstandmyself project and I ignoresubstitute the theistic stuffI know its different for everyone. I can only say that for me the process of facing and admitting certain things and making a plan for how to change them has caused a mental shift in my head.

3308152,0,t3_2y05di,Day three is the toughest one for many of us. If you can make it past that you may start feeling physically and mentally stronger bit by bit.  I found it helpful to focus entirely on learning how to stay away from alcohol at first  forming new habits and patterns getting used to the idea of living sober until it started to come naturally.  Some people find support groups like AA or SMART helpful. The main thing is to realize that alcohol is an addictive drug not the magic potion weve all been raised to believe is necessary to happiness.

The only times it sort of rubs me the wrong way is when the Ive seen this all before becomes too heavy handed.We all have our own journeys to take and we all are different people. Not to say any of us are special snowflakes or exceptional or anything but we are different people. Sometimes there are posts where its hard believe the commenter even read what the OP wrote to the end. Ive seen this type before and here is the prepared response I give in these situations That isnt great.I like the tough love types I like the gentle support types I like them all. I just dont like when a newer person writes a well thought out reflective post and theres a comment sort of dismissing their personal struggle in favor categorizing them and saying Ive seen it all beforeThat said it is helpful to have people are who can give real positive feedback and who can vouch for truly how much better life is alcohol free.Edited to Add I like and agree with almost everything the old timers say.

Its indescribable and unbearable.  I am only comfortable and happy when I curl up in bed at night with a warm air humidifier.  I do not have paradoxical obstruction so Im not sure if I have true ENS but I desperately wish I could go back to my presurgery state which admittedly wasnt as bad as yours so it may be worth the risk to you.  Ive never had depression in my life but Im fighting it now.  I feel like my life is kind of over based on one bad decision I should have researched more and trusted my ENT less.

Watts says youre not born  in to this world youre born out of it in much the same way that a wave is born out of the ocean.  The matter that composes you arose out of world around you. Youll ripple across the surface of the universe for a time your composition constantly changing. At no point in time will you be the same wave you were at any other instant.  Waves arent lost to the world when they break.  In fact what is a wave at all?  Theres no way to determine where a wave starts and where the ocean ends because thats not how waves work.

You chose not to follow those suggestions and to get sober later on your own terms which you know is a lie. You arent slipping. Slipping is what happens to people who wanted to be sober. You want to keep drinking and not feel bad about it. That is something else entirely.

3974946,0,t3_35zqbg,Of course AA is not the only answer there are other ways to achieve relatively longlasting abstinence.All paths to recovery from substance addiction or alcoholism however require a deep fundamental psychic shift in the addictdrinker.  Mere promises to do better couple with a few halfhearted attempts to comply with peoples directives are not going to be sufficient.Fundamental shifts in psychic temperament occur under exceptional circumstances.  A few common ways to induce a psychic change in oneself are religious conversion intense oneonone psychotherapy a transcendental spiritual experience under the guidance of a mentor or guru and working a twelve step program with a sponsor.  Obviously the most common path to psychic change for an alcoholicaddict is twelvestep based.  That is based on availability.  There are more AANA meetings than there are gurus and psychotherapy can cost tens of thousands of dollars.  And alcoholics and addicts are notorious for not getting along with clergy.I am biased in that I completely failed my rehab I was discharged for noncompliance and got sober through the rooms of AA.  so you can take my advice with however many grains of salt that you like.  While some people can achieve longterm abstinence from alcohol and drugs without doing the twelve steps or any other method of psychic change it has been my observation that these people are not essentially happy.  They are no longer experiencing the consequences of drinking and drug use but that is it.  I speak of course about true alcoholics and addicts not just people who have developed a moderate dependence.Recovery is achieved by attaining a state of mind in which sobriety produces gratitude.  Not only am I abstinent today but I am happy mentally healthier than before and I definitely wouldnt go back to drinking and getting high even if I could do so without consequence because my recovery brought about by practicing the twelve steps in my life had brought about a spiritual high better than any drink or drug could provide.  Hard to believe?  Sure.  But I can am speaking from personal experience.  Your mileage may vary.So if your counselors say that you are on the path to relapse without AA they are partially right.  Without some sort of radical realignment of your mental focus you are probably not going to achieve your goal of recovery.  Whether that realignment that psychic change comes from AA NA intensive mental health therapy NOT just going to outpatient and seeing a counselor for an hour a week travelling to India to see a yogi or joining a religious denomination is immaterial.  Just accept one.But to quit drinking and doing drugs and replacing that gigantic hole in your life with nothing is the surest path back to active alcoholism and addiction that I know.Some of us see the light.  Others such as myself have to feel the heat first.  Do not be afraid to question some of your underlying assumptions about spirituality and Higher Power if that is your hangup about AA.  That is what I had to do.  I had to see what the alternative to recovery was really like before I was ready to accept a spiritual solution.  More importantly I had to see that my ideas about spirituality were fundamentally flawed.  I was not seeing the light because I had mistaken notions about what that light was and very mistaken ideas about where failure to practice a spiritual solution would take me.Working the twelve steps to the best of my ability was the hardest thing I ever did in my life.  but I can also say that nothing else has paid off so generously.  If you are currently clean and sober this is your chance your bottom if you want it to be.  You dont have to dig any further down.  Unless like me you decide that you want to.  I do not recommend it.

But then once I was drunk really good the ride was already ending for me. In fact I really disliked it.  All I would want from that point on was to be completely sober again. I would even force myself to puke the extra alcohol I drank to speed up the process.  It was not fun. So yeah I cant really say truthfully that drinking made me feel great because it doesnt last long enough. It actually would make me angry.

By day  I was feeling much better.Somewhere around day  I finally! had the best sleep of my life.My whole first month was a struggle to not buy booze.  I went hour by hour for that entire  days.  Heres a chart I kept crossing off each hour as it passed.  After  days I was ready to start trying to put things back together.For the first  months I would bounce from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows all in the course of like  minutes.  It wasnt fun.  After three months things seemed to even out.I had a panic attack somewhere in there.  I forget when it was probably month  or .  Ever have one those before?  If your answer is maybe then your answer is no.  If you had one youd know.  That was my first and only panic attack. God those things suck.Id quit counting the days on my badge around day .  Thats not to say that the badge had no value to me its more that it was no longer a daily struggle.  In the beginning Id hit reload reload reload just to see my badge flip to the next day.  By day  I wasnt thinking about the badge all that much.  I had a couple milestones sneak up on me  such that I was left saying Holy cow its been that long already?  If I didnt have a badge now Id have no idea what that number was.After  months or so I was feeling pretty solid most of the time but I remember leaving someones Labor Day party because I had a passing thought about having a drink.  It wasnt a serious thought at all but part of my plan iswas that as soon as I have any inking of a thought like Hmmm maybe I get the hell out of there.   Some may call it overcautious but I dont think so. The fact is I drank for  years straight and I cant give you any rational explanation as to why.   If I dont know why I did it how could I possibly expect to stop it from happening again in the heat of the moment?   Thats why I leave.I havent had any serious cravings in a couple years.  A fleeting thought once in a blue moon.  Fleeting probably doesnt even do it justice. Were talking like splitsecond here.

4070803,0,t3_377f1q,That sucks. Women are complicated amazing creatures. Ive found that drinking to forget difficult experiences and emotions only provides a temporary fix if that. In fact what is really going on is that the alcohol is masking these emotions and your brain cannot properly process them. So once you sober up they are still there often surrounded by other emotions youve accumulated in the meantime. Except now your brain chemistry is all out of whack so that dealing with emotions of all kinds becomes even MORE difficult. Many of us chose to drink more in that situation. Aaaaand the cycle continues.Emotions both good and bad are part of life whether us guys like it or not! Learning to truly feel theses emotions and accept the way we feel is a part of becoming a whole human being.I dont know about you but NOT drinking brings me closer to this ideal. Best of luck to you.

Right now its a big piece of your life eventually not drinking will be a habit the problems your drinking caused you will be further behind you and other parts of your life will be more consuming.

The only way for me was to realize that just one drink would have me drunk.  I couldnt ever just have one or two.  I always got drunk.  So when I finally got this through my head it was a relief to truly know that even one was too much.  It was that first drink that set off this whole process.

Im learning how to use it to keep me grounded and stay still and quiet rather than letting it pull me in and losing all control. I have seen enough days like this to recognize it and use caution and HALT. The difference is that this time I want to stay sober I wasnt ready when I first noticed the connection between the moon and my drinking I had quit for all the wrong reasons.  Now that I have some experience with not drinking I still get scared when I see a full moon but I dont feel the tingling and the hair on the back of my neck rising like I used to.

The story ends with you finally being happy and contented with family relationships restored and your sense of worth reestablished.  You wonder why it took you so long to see the obvious.

4347349,0,t1_csfl4x6,I relate to this finding then asking a potential sponsor was like asking the first girl out at school. But if theres one thing Ive learned about my recovery is that Im scared of most things but when I do them they dont actually kill or hurt me. I dont mean that to sound trite its just how it is for me. Drinking and drugging hurt us way more than some of the tough decisions we have to make in recovery and our reticence is often the inner addict trying to avoid getting worked on. Well done for beating the pills thats a huge achievement. I cold turkeyed a morphine scrip a couple of months ago and it was the single worst  thing ive experienced. You clearly have a huge reserve of strength. I wish you all the best.,stopdrinking,csfoflq,1,t5_2s7yr

I also dated a lot in my early sobriety yes its still early but now Im just dating one person and the only person who heard and respected me when I said I dont drink but I dont care if were around itif you do. I love that about him...h is Inc edibly supportive and I can talk to him about anything but he treats me like an adult and isnt constantly checking to make sure Im okcomfortabletemptedother condescending crap. Maybe your friends just dont get it but frankly I would be offended if someone kept making sure I was ok. My friends dont drink much anyways though so Im not usually the only one for any random reason...so nobody really singles me out.

4411537,0,t3_3bjdip,Hey man! I was in the same position you are now. I must have had over  day s trying to quit. I also gained  lbs over the last  years of insane drinking. I also basically lived in video games because I couldnt go out and do things. When I got too drunk I could just go to sleep.... often Id get up and do it all over again. When I finally started to make traction with sobriety I had a fully different mindset than before. I wasnt just going to stop drinking. I want to be healthy damnit! Life is so wonderful and so terribly short. I want to experience it. I want to go hiking. I want to go snowboarding. I want to be a runner and run half marathons for charity. So I made health goals for myself. I got myself a fitbit and its so awesome for a gamer mind set. You get badges for achievements. You can do challenge mode with friends. Dont have friends with a fit bit PM me and Ill add you to my group. It competes for the highest step count. There was a quote over in sdrunning that said my legs are my weapons my war is alcoholism Ive made it my mantra. I bought an elliptical in January so that way rain or snow I could run through my cravings. When a craving hit I just went running. At the end of it I found my craving subsided and I was a sweaty happy mess. Running releases endorphins and its so rewarding. At first I hated it. I couldnt get higher than k steps in a day without feeling defeated. My new high score is k steps. Over  miles of running half a marathon! I also made it a point to be mentally healthier. Each week I devote an hour of time each day to a new topic I was previously unfamiliar with. I sucked at history in school so I started there. The library of Alexandria wad fucking epic as shit. Hypatia is a new hero of mine. Also I highly recommend the youtube channel mentalfloss they have a program called Crash course which is like an ELI thats animated. I made myself find new hobbies. Even if they sounded ridiculous  its  who knits anymore? This girl does now. Happy day  post tomorrow at the morning check in for a day  victory! Dont forget to be awesome!,stopdrinking,csmwy22,3,t5_2s7yr

4452861,0,t3_3c3nbg,I cannot associate this concept to when I quit drinking because I never really actually TRIED to quit. I half assed attempted to not drink for a day or two here or there but I never ever said to myself until the day I quit Thats it.  Im done. and meant it to the bottom of my soul.  I had basically resigned myself to drinking until I died because quitting felt impossible. I was helpless but it wasnt learned because I tried to quit. It was learned becaue I didnt want to let go of my life blood. I was helpless to its siren call because it was When I quit smoking I used the knowledge that I had gained from here about no giving up when I failed. It took me several tries of quitting over a few months trying something different each time before it finally took.  I never felt this sense of helplessness because I knew from shared experience that if I kept trying IT WOULD WORK. After reading this it makes me grateful all over again for this community and what I have learned here. I didnt have to feel stuck and helpless in that struggle. ,stopdrinking,csrytwv,1,t5_2s7yr

Its just good to hear ppl talk as you can pick up SO much from it and it can really help you living your day to day I found.There is no pressure and you dont HAVE to go to as many as physically possible.

Maybe do it!I think somebody in this sub talked about going on a cruise through Alaska that changed his or her life. And I think that is an awesome idea.gt Ive pushed away so many good people. Ive spent so much money. Ive hurt so many feelings...I understand. I like to think that I can build relationships with even more good people. I can save money now. I can resolve to never again hurt feelings for selfish reasons. gt I feel like life has passed me by.Sometimes I feel that way too...I am definitely stunted when compared to a lot of other people my age...but whatever. Life is happening TODAY and I am going to live it. And I have learned a lot of things from my particular slice of life that allows me to be more sensitive towards and accepting of others  we are all on our own journey. For that I am grateful. Just remember the only thing that is certain is change.

Obviously there is a way to remain sober without AA because AA has not been around forever less than  years and people have quit drinking throughout history.  There are many paths but I personally believe whether someone uses AA SMART their own recovery plan like I did  the key is to take action and change your life.

4917136,0,t1_cuebmew,I agree.  Youll see people celebrating their number of years sober and others just starting their journey to a better life through sobriety.Some come here because they dont want to drink because its starting to affect them in a negative way others come here because its completely ruining their life if it hasnt already.  The good thing is that you can always change it and start improving yourself today which it sounds like youre already doing.Coming here will give you some perspective on how others came to this point and how it has affected them and what theyre doing to actively avoid the very thing that has been causing so much trouble for them.  The best part is that you can actively participate and share your own story and share advice or offer perspectives to others while we can do the same for you.Sign up for a badge in the sidebar to the right to keep track of your days sober and read through the sub to get some perspective.  It can feel incredibly isolating when starting something like this but rstopdrinking can make it that much easier because we are all here to get better and we all have that goal in common.,stopdrinking,cueccrx,2,t5_2s7yr

You say youre not a danger to anyone. But what about yourself? I knew well before I encountered any of the cliche consequences of my drinking that this was a big problem.

You have to ask yourself why am I pretending to drink? WHO do I want to be?Also if you are trying to get sober in the early days stay away from alcohol. Only when you are ready and you know you are ready expose yourself to drinking situations. This is just common sense. You will miss out on some social events in the beginning but it should be worth it. How long until you are ready I dont know everyone is different but in my opinion you should have a couple hundred days or more.Good luck everybody. This isnt easy but it also isnt hard.

My only advice would be to see a doctorhe or she would be able to help you with the anxiety and sleeping. I find Benadryl helps me with sleepand it doesnt go through the liver which is good. Know that the withdraw effects will subside over time. It took a while but my anxiety really lowered after I quit drinking I had been drinking BECAUSE I was so anxious but while I felt better initially it was much worse later. Like many things in life the cure seems to be more time.  There are just no shortcuts no matter how we try. If youre a naturally anxious person it may be something you just have to manage. But definitely drinking makes it worsejust google it and youll see how it adds to it. Anywaynot sure if thats helpful but Ive been where you areI had the same drinking issues as youI drank normally for years then heavily and then suddenly went off the rails.

Waking up in the morning with a clear head and not having to wonder what I did last night or where did that bruise come from?? has been such a joyous feeling!

5058365,0,t3_3k9agd,Those memories are fleeting for me and rarely gave me any motivation to stop and think before I drank again. At best they prompted me to drink more water and pace myself. You know like a professional!What has given me strength to make it through a commitment to not drink in the past is several things. Recall the gains I want to make... no drunk social media a plus. Saying out loud only the things I choose to instead of every thought dribbling out of my lips a plus. Waking up the next day clear and refreshed a huge plus AND a gift to myself. Not saturating my already poisoned skin with more poison. These are incentives. They go hand in hand with the action. Nothing changes if nothing changes. Its an incredibly powerful statement in the moment and good to keep handy. Reminding myself that its only todaytonight that I have to get through. Asking myself to be honest about what I think Im missing out on and if its worth the disappointment I know Ill be dealing with after one night of drinking. Often this thought process evolves into thinking of ALL of things Ill be turning my back on and starting over just for a few hours of oblivion. There are many many ways to make it through and the more you practice the more tools youll have in your tool box. Alcoholism is progressive? So is sobriety. You get places by taking one small step at a time. Minute by minute if necessary. ,stopdrinking,cuvq2gt,5,t5_2s7yr

If your anything like me you can look back at some point and remember drinking and be appalled and or ashamed of your behavior.

5080444,0,t3_3kl1s8,One of the more important things Ive learned in my journey is not to write off or deny myself things that have helped people. I was very resistant to AA but I went because I was willing to try anything. It ended up not being what I needed but going fortified my conviction to quit and I learned a lot of valuable things. I was resistant to sober people sober places and that has proven to be a boon. I dont go places where the main event is alcohol or when its not if I have a slight tinge of temptation or cannot leave easily. Little by little trying new things has helped build and arsenal of tools that has made this quit almost effortless. You and I had a similar pattern to our drinking with my cycle lasting a week or two. One practical thing I found helped was staying longer at work and perhaps taking more breaks during the day to avoid burnout. I found if I got past the  hour my temptation to drink went away. Ive also made it part of my daily ritual to check in here and read posts. Ive also started meditating which after a month and a half now has really equipped me with skills to lie below my impulses and emotions headspace is the app Ive used. As for things to do at night the options are limitless. From Netflix to hobbies I like music the time Ive gained by not drinking and then by not being hungover is ridiculous. In terms of work I am also in a very technical field the clarity and efficiency gained through sobriety is amazing. ,stopdrinking,cuydwmo,2,t5_2s7yr

So as for my actions for today I just wrote an email cancelling on a party with coworkers thats coming up. I love my colleagues and the parties are always tons of fun but there is always lots and lots of drinking involved. I know they would be supportive and there would even be other dry people there but I am still not taking that risk.Then I will be talking to a good friend later tonight. He was never a drinking buddy so Id be very surprised if he was anything but supportive. Its weird  Im actually looking forward to it. I take it as a good sign.

It took me  years to come out of the hellish relapse that followed.

5253446,0,t1_cvj7hnw,Thank you very much for your reply.  You motivated me to look up a line from a book which seemed very apt and encapsulates how I viewed his attitude towards me There are many varieties of sharp practitioners in this world but I think the hardest of all to deal with are the men who overreach you under the disguise of inveterate goodhumour.  I suppose the modern version of this is someone pulling a prank or making an offensive joke and then saying You mad bro?The trigger is not him so much in himself but the idea that Im single again and got another failed relationship behind me approx five years.  Ive lost contact with a lot of friends from church since becoming an atheist  years ago.  Maybe going back to church would be better than drinking?  I cant say  that I dont believe in God I still pray occasionally.  I used to enjoy helping out at the community activities usually baking cookies and selling them to raise money for the Scouts and Girl Guides.  It felt good to be included in social events and feeling that I was contributing to a good cause.I cant afford Netflix finances are in the red right now.  Youtube is accessible through the broadband.  I watch a lot of documentaries too.  I need to count my blessings that I have access to the internet as a resource and more importantly be able to use it to receive encouragement from awesome individuals such as your goodself.I know Im not alone.  It makes me sad to think that other people are dealing with fighting an addiction and feeling heartbroken at the same time though.  Its so hard!  I feel like I could cry for all of them as well as myself but that helps noone at all.Thanks again.,stopdrinking,cvj88mt,2,t5_2s7yr

Ive found it incredibly useful to have an outside perspective on my successes and failures.Personally I think the third year was the worst but Ive had a couple of real cravings this year as well. I am pretty vigilante about the random drinking thoughts that come and go and I talk about them honestly with my husband. Values are hard but I am pretty simplistic about them I try to be compassionate and helpful to myself and others. Thats it. That way I can always come back to that if I am struggling.

And yes I think thats where the real work begins. I can see issues in my life that Ive been ignoring for years maybe decades. Drinking provided enough of a haze that I ignored them most of the time. Feeling shitty about that personal failing? How about I drink a six pack so I can tune out my own uncomfortable thoughts. I feel like just getting sober doesnt fix any of my underlying issues. But it puts me in a much better position to address and work on them because at a minimum Im not just ignoring them any more.,stopdrinking,cvsc18x,1,t5_2s7yr

Ive been meditating playing guitar reading a bunch going to the gym taking walks and playing video games more. These however didnt come all at once. At the beginning there was a lot of Netflix here too but I started to integrate these activities more and more and little by little until now Netflix is a very small part of my week. I also switched my schedule I get up a lot earlier and go to sleep a lot earlier. This has had the effect of giving me hours in the day I hadnt filled before so it became easier to fill it with new things. But basically I think the most important part for me was starting slowly. A half hour of guitar a few days becomes a couple of hours almost daily over time. ,stopdrinking,cvwst9x,4,t5_2s7yr

I didnt want to admit that I will go out less go to less parties. But I do. Not completely of course. And you will adapt and find other things to do and other ways to go out. And when you do go to parties and their is alcohol it will always be hard. It is for me. But it also becomes a new habit. ,stopdrinking,cvwup94,1,t5_2s7yr

My main reason for distancing myself from saying that Im an alcoholic wasnt any self delusion or shame I am a drinker but just trying not to be misleading as if I am fishing for a support without really being in that deep.

5362896,0,t3_3oh84l,I had to change my perception.  I decided I could take everything in life for granted like I had been or I can be grateful for everything in my life.  When I look at the world humans have created I believe it is a miracle and I realize how I took everything for granted.  I even smile when I wash my hands now grateful for running water.  I mean its amazing to me that I can turn a faucet and have unlimited clean water.  Just going home and having a TV with so many different things to watch is a miracle to me.I also realized and accepted that abusing my mind and body with a drug I didnt even enjoy anymore was not something to look forward to.  I had allowed my entire life to get out of wack where I believed the only thing that gave me pleasure was an addictive poison.  That was a lie though because drinking never really gave me pleasure especially the last few years of my addiction.  It took time but I had to first quit drinking and give my mind and body time to heal and clear the fog.  Then I had to figure out what I enjoyed and wanted from life then I set out a plan to obtain them.  What I look forward to now in addition to just the amazing little things in this world is the setting and accomplishing of goals. ,stopdrinking,cvx65ll,2,t5_2s7yr

5481215,0,t3_3q5gnu,I think if thats how you really feel about alcohol then youre not an alcoholic in the way that I am. For me it has the astonishing power of something like a black hole where I start off fine on the light side and then imperceptibly slide into the abyss until Im just tanked pretty much constantly and maintenance drinking throughout the day to avoid withdrawl.  I have quit before only to start again confidently and have the same thing happen. Its like nothing else Ive ever experienced the power of this outright addiction to lead me to total selfabandon with such consistency. Its never happened with any other substance Ive used and Ive dabbled my fair share.In my experience this mystifying ballstothewall takeover that alcohol manifests in certain people is one form of true alcoholism where it really is totally out of your control and will lead you to insanity or death if you dont get help. My life has become unthinkably grim at times because of alcohol and I have acted in ways I knew were crazy for long sustained periods of time but I couldnt stop because.. well thats the mystifying part. Your problem sounds like an addiction of sorts but dont worry about it being alcoholism or not. If its something you want to change try to change it. You dont need to be an alcoholic to get help with a drinking problem!Hope you find whats best for you!,stopdrinking,cwc9yuw,3,t5_2s7yr

But I think for a lot of people doing both better. SD is serving as my support group for now. AAanother group  and CBT therapy combined can let you relate to a group of people with the same struggles and then you can compliment it with a deep personal one on one discussion with a trained professional who works with anxiety depression and stress. My therapist has taught me tools which are life saving for me. I used to turn to the bottle when I got stressed out or was really sad... now I have other ways of coping which are healthier and more productive. ,stopdrinking,cwfuocf,2,t5_2s7yr

When I have tried moderation I still lacked the mental reaction that made me want to stop a just  or  and sooner or later I went off the rails.

I think Im realizing that even if most of the time I dont get drunk the occasions where I end up just getting blitzed just ruin my and everyone elses day.    Regarding employment I just graduated with a doctorate in  and owe a ton of money. I have only been employed for  months since last May and had trouble getting a job in the first place plus with all the student loans I owe it really feels like I cant take another unemployment break to search for another job.,stopdrinking,cwsa47m,2,t5_2s7yr
5610879,0,t3_3ryfx0,gtCan xanax be used during times like these or is it just an extension of using substances out of fear and Cowardice?Youre the only one who can decide that for yourself.However since you asked for an opinion as an alcoholic who has abused benzos in the past seen alcoholics go back to drinking after using benzos and seen far too many doctors without a comprehensive understanding of their risks especially when it comes to recovering addicts I would personally never go near them. Especially not to tackle something as trivial as a high school reunion. For a normal person yes I think they can be a useful and even essential tool. But for me it would be the same as taking a drink. If it is something youre contemplating needing chemical adjustment for perhaps its something you want to reconsider doing at all. You are not committed to the reunion. Its not depending on your being there to proceed. I find that doing things for the sole sake of testing my sobriety sounds an awful lot like my ego stepping in and telling me that I have control of this thing. Let us know what you decide. It is absolutely your decision though. ,stopdrinking,cwsl0t1,2,t5_2s7yr

Before you meet any health problems hopefully your life will be affected loved ones work social... it is the way to reach bottom not recommended. If you can drink  drinks and stop then it might be a different story.Also drinking goes hand in hand with depression so instead of making you happier it has the opposite effect.In my experience everybody can tell you to stop drinking all they want but if you ever do the decision will come from you alone.

5862651,0,t3_3vjojs,Welcome. It sounds like you have made the right choice. As hard as it may sound you really should try avoiding any events where drinking will be heavily involved at least for the first few weeks. If you go out with friends and you havent properly explained your sobriety to them they might make it very difficult for you. Your brain might trick you into thinking you can have just one drink...just dont do it. It sucks because you say you are a social person but you are just going to put yourself in some very bad situations that you might not be ready to handle yet. You have already had several chances to get sober as you said so you really dont want to have to do this all over again. At what point are the people in your life going to say no more? Its scary and so many of us have been there. Try and stay away from temptation. You might think you are strong enough to handle it but alcohol is a cunning devil. It will find a way to sneak back in to your life if you let it close to you. I cant tell you how liberating it is to know that I dont have to be on my last chance ever again. Best of luck friend. We are all rooting for you.,stopdrinking,cxo4gru,2,t5_2s7yr

It was a week at first then two then someone commented on a post I made to come here.  I did read some posts and realized the commitment needed to be permanent.The only change I had to make in going from taking a break to stopping permanently was that I no longer had the possibility of an end date in my head.  Before I was just taking it one day at a time not sure if the next day would be the day I got back into old habits.  Once I made the decision I just kept taking it one day at a time but got the idea that Id go back at all out of my head.  Its helped and so have the people here.

5947482,0,t1_cxyq79l,First off congrats on your decision. Its a difficult place to arrivequitting drinking is definitely a radical move in our society and its not easy to cut out the toxic influences in your life that make it even harder friends places etc.Second a suggestion based on personal experience. What really helped me in the very beginning was the support and fellowship of likeminded individuals. Other sober recovering alcoholics.Many times I had quit drinking on my own. Inevitably as my my body healed and the memory of my latest shame faded Id convince myself why drinking again was perfectly fine. Loneliness makes this delusional thinking worse for me. After deciding to see my drinking friends less the biggest help in my recovery was the company and community of other alcoholics. I was super skeptical of AA but I turned out to make many amazing friends through it. Im an atheist myself so dont be put off by the God thing. There are other groups of value too.Best of luck.,stopdrinking,cxz8u25,2,t5_2s7yr

5975428,0,t3_3x8g85,If thems the rules for AA then thems the rules unfortunately.This is a personal preference but I would count weed as a violation of my sobriety IF it was causing a problem with my productivity andor I was buying a new bag after finishing an old bag. Also if it was leading me to drink again.Heres my experience and it isnt black and white. I often refer back to the last time I quit drinking I reached  days and it definitely wouldnt have counted at first if I didnt quit smoking weed as well. I got to day  of full sobriety and I had a bit of a meltdown because I was so used to always having a crutch. Either weed booze or both. I had to quit both because otherwise I was just escaping reality with one and not the other. A few weeks later I decided to have some weed with a mate. About a month later I bought a bag and smoked it. After that and even when I went back to drinking my weed habits had changed dramatically.Since then about  years Ive probably spent under  on weed. I smoke it occasionally and I finish the bag and get on with my life. So at this moment I personally do not believe that weed is having a negative enough impact on my life that I should resist it. However when I do buy a bag I invariably remember why I dont smoke the stuff so much any more. I just prefer being clear headed  of the time.If Ive been smoking weed for an afternoon Im still lucid. I can still function and complete tasks. That makes it acceptable to me and my experience. What makes it positive to me is that it gives me a different perspective on whats going on in my lifeand in my head although this is negated if Im on it all the time because that view becomes the norm and is no longer a different perspective. I just find I can be better intouch with what I want from my life and if Im being real.Now if the pot somehow led me to the bottle thatd mean that Id have to take stock and start again from scratch completely removing both drugs from my life. As it stands I dont need to make that decision because it isnt. I have a bag on me but I have to pick up some staff from work in  minutes so naturally Im sober right now. Once this bag is finished its finished. I know I can do that because of the evidence of the past  years.I do want to emphasise that this is MY experience with weed and I would recommend thorough selfobservation to make sure youre on the right path.,stopdrinking,cy2wrso,1,t5_2s7yr

I drank club soda and teahouse party at my place where everyone drank wine and I drank teawork related XMAS party... Just had a little water redbull talked to who I needed to and I bounced earlydate with a girl who had  drinks and we went to a club and all I drank was water and  redbullwork meeting at a local beer bar that used to be my favorite hangout drank club soda  diet cokeIn my life these are not tests but simply reckless dangerous behaviours with little to no upside.  Personally I found early sobriety had very little to do with tests and much more to do with hard proactive work to substantially change me into a better happier person.Anyway best of luck to you moving forward.,stopdrinking,cy6m79h,15,t5_2s7yr

6010990,0,t1_cy7k8xd,Yeah I know. Im an alpha accomplished guy. But it took me  years of drinking to figure out that dealing with the truth is not weakness. Knowing the truth and living elsewise because of fear is weakness. The fear is not the weakness inaction in the face of it is. Let me suggest one thing that you might suspect If youre a heavy drinker sure you can function and sometimes feel like shit and sometimes feel like an iron man because youre up in the morning and taking care of business. But thats delusion in my experience. I built my business largely while I was drinking. But I know know that I missed many opportunities to make it better to make better decisions to pursue opportunitiesbecause I was drinking or dealing with the aftermath. No nothing blew up but it could have been better.I extend that to other parts of life. I have a marriage that fell apart the seeds of which included my longstanding drinking. My kids are great and I feel luckybut that could have turned differently and I know I missed some opportunities there too. Point being that just because things are going OK now doesnt mean that heavy drinking doesnt have an impact. It does. I didnt have a basis for comparison for many years however that is as a sober person. Im not assuming this should motivate you but hope it might offer perspective on the more subtle effects of drinking heavily over time. ,stopdrinking,cy7kk5n,1,t5_2s7yr

6020256,0,t3_3xx65n,TLDR i should sleep happy holidays thanks for posting this when i needed it. Happy Holidays! And also Happy almost? Birthday! Ive been kinda off today thoughtwise. Went to the first of  family christmases this week the beginning of my first christmas sober. There was a lot of wine and Id already started craving it before i even got there. Ive never even liked wine but it sounded like an acceptable or sophisticatedandnotanalcoholic thing to drink. Luckily i knew i just had to aboid the first drink and i had my boyfriend there for support as well. Got through it with root beer and coffee! But even tonight home amd sober in bed Ive still been thinking about it.Then i saw the title of your post. Gratitude. I thought more into it and realized that Im super thankful for my sobriety that Ive been working so hard for. And Im thankful for all the people that give advice on this sub and post about their relapses and how much it sucks. For once in my life Im taking others advice instead of having to learn the hard way! It wouldnt have been worth it to throw away  months on a glass of wine that i probably wouldnt have enjoyed and would certainly have regretted afterward. Your post made me think about my rock bottom when i decided enough was enough. And the first few days of hell that i never have to go through again if i so choose. Basically youve reminded me why Im sober. Anyway sorry if this is scatteredsounding. Its am and i cant fall asleep because of aforementioned coffee at pm.  whoops. My entire point of this whole comment is to say thanks for this youve got great timing!,stopdrinking,cy8s3e5,2,t5_2s7yr

6049113,0,t1_cyc8xlh,gt I think when you drink you put the process on hold my grieving showed up full force when I put the bottle down again.This is true of so many healing functions. People dont always realize that wounds in the mind are every bit as real as wounds in the body and much like the body has a process to heal wounds so does the mind. The fact that this healing isnt visible does not mean that it is not happening. Did you know that alcohol blocks physical healing? It blocks mental healing too.A death of someone close to you is an injury to your inner being a real wound that demands a a real response. Grief is simply the process by which the mind heals itself of this terrible terrible injury. And it is a terrible injury. Make no mistake about it. Our minds are about half full of the people that we bring into our lives and when we learn that they are no longer around that part of us that was them the part that we built there just for them so close to the surface of who we are that part has to go to a different place for a little while and be reshaped into something that we can handle.

My life sober was pure unadulterated suffering so why not drink?Turns out Im happier than Ive ever been now. I buy groceries go to the gym cook for myself browse the internet go to sleep wake up feeling normal and not hungover.

6157518,0,t1_cypj83z,That sucks whoelseisgonky. Heartbreaking. I went through hell in my relationship too when  I got sober. I am not a religious person AT ALL but you know what helped me? I used the serenity prayer as a kind of a touch stone instead of an actual prayer to help keep me grounded in today and the now. It helped me keep remembering that I have no control over others only myself. Grant me the serenity to accept the things or people I cannot changeThe courage to the change the things I can meAnd the wisdom the know the difference. Trying to change that other person was like trying to moderate. It was impossible because I had no control over it. She is her own person who is going to do what she is going to do. Does that change the hurt that you feel? No but by accepting that you have no control over her you can control the level of damage that her leaving does to you.

So much of what Ive learned about myself in the past few years is that Im not as much of a special snowflake as I used to think I grew up as a smart and precocious child in a very small town and so Ive had people telling me I was superspecial and unusual from a very young age. Ive already been disabused of the notion that Im really that much smarter than other people and then finally coming to terms with my alcohol addiction also felt like admitting that Im not special or an exception. I suffer from a really common problem that a lot of other people have. In a way this feels comforting like joining the human race after a long absence.,stopdrinking,cywpl71,3,t5_2s7yr

6418519,0,t3_43ktx1,I have reflected on this thread for a few hours and think it is a very useful discussion.I would recommend that this sub relabel itself as strictly for those who want to abstain. It should explicitly state that moderation is not an option to be aired.This is for two reasonsFirst I think it is unfair to those for whom moderation could work. There are many people in the world who decide to cut down on alcohol and successfully do so. However the people on this thread mostly represent the group for whom moderation does not work. They also tend to associate with others who have the same issue. Therefore it is a self selecting group giving sample bias. Nothing wrong with that per se except that someone who really could benefit from moderation will probably come away with the impression that moderation never works which is not true.On the other hand as someone else noted folks on this board have to waste their time on discussions with people who really do want to moderate and are not persuaded it is impossible. Therefore for the good of all I think the side bar should be changed to get rid of the control drinking part and the word should get out that any position promoting moderation will be removed.,stopdrinking,czj7m9b,4,t5_2s7yr

She wants something to eat Im at the grocery store getting pudding. She wants a new book Im there. Her husband needs a break Ill sit with her a while. It was really a terrific opportunity for me to be of service to her and try to pay back just a little bit of everything shes done for me. I was a truck load of encouragement and love and hope.I hate giving advice but if I were you Id try to look at it the same way. Youre going to be no help if youre bleary eyed wondering if booze is on your breath tired pessimistic and preoccupied with the next drink so dont drink today and try that again tomorrow and the next day. Just  hours at a time.It sounds like your mother has good health care available to her so its something to be grateful for. Maybe things couldve been worse. Sure they could be better but they certainly could be worse. Pray about things youre worried about and the things youre grateful for. You could be a militant atheist thats fine. If God doesnt exist to you thats fine then youll be praying to nothing but if hesheitthey does go for it. If youre not sure borrow mine.The cravings and triggers will pass. You know where they lead you and that wont make anything better. The best you can do right now is be at your best for your mother tomorrow.

6421632,0,t1_czjj24t,I say let it all out. Keeping so many emotions and insecurities in is part of what got me drinking so destructively.I know theres a lot of people that say the further away you are from your last drink the closer you are to relapse.

6421969,0,t3_43kpm6,I found that drinking prevented me from working on my underlying problems. Full stop. Stopping drinking didnt solve my problems but it did allow me to work on them. I couldnt have done it while drinking. Im not sure how it all works out and some stuff goes far back to early life experienceIm in my s and drank for  years less a break. I do think that drinking was an expression of a kind of narcissism a selfishness at least. What was interesting to me and perhaps paralleling your experience was that I thought Id left that sort of bad behavior behind me when I stopped drinking. I assumed it. But I was wrong and found that the selfcentered behavior persistedthat this was a real aspect of my life and not just a function of alcohol. Sothats the function of sobrietydealing with my arrested development. OK I can do that sober. Thanks for your thoughts.,stopdrinking,czjkgjx,2,t5_2s7yr

6437459,0,t3_43sd9h,Just tossing in my two cents though I dont comment as much as I had in the past. Ive also had less time to participate so thats a factor as well personally. I cant say yes or no. I believe this place has saved a lot of lives and has returned sanity to some that could not find it elsewhere. Bigger numbers mean change no matter how you cut it though that doesnt necessarily have to be bad. There is going to be positives and negatives in either direction. The change that affected me personally is the increase in posts. I cant keep up. I used to spend a quality hour or more during the day of catching up and interacting but now there is so much I cherry pick by title. Some topics have lost their weight for my interest due to over saturation. Again this is how its affected me personally and does not mean its a good or bad thing for the sub as a whole. However who would argue that this safe quality corner of the world should not be shared with others that are exactly where weve been? It should be available to everyone. Should we encourage exposure? I dont know as in Im clueless not as in questioning it. The larger we get the more the dynamic will change. Maybe that will push more activity in the local subreddits. Who knows? But whatever change will come theres no reversing back to how it used to beimo. Just some things to consider. ,stopdrinking,czl66vb,8,t5_2s7yr

6474861,0,t3_44aqhg,I felt that way my first year sober. The thing for me was my ego I somehow thought after a year of not drinking that I was immune. I didnt realize until a few years later how hard it was to sober up but thankfully this time around I see the blessings that have come from not drinking. Its been really tough for me to get to  months I just had to grit my teeth and hang on one day at a time a lot of times but here I am today. the difference in me is that today I realize that drinking wont make anything better or make me enjoy things more. Its easier though to stay away from alcohol completely than it is to get sober after picking up where I left off. Good on you for recognizing the signs before they start building up. Thank you for reminding me what it was like I forget sometimes. Im not thinking of drinking but I still have to stay vigilant and keep on doing what I do to keep myself sober.

I can control myself if I dont drink. When I drink forget about it. So will power then is worthless. If I was looking for things to keep me out of AA I could have found plenty. As it was when I was early in sobriety I was so desperate and hungry for recovery that I was open to any thing that offered any kind of relief. And AA did. The fellowship is golden. I made friends. I learned how to have a happy sober life. Granted it is possible to do it without AA but its what worked for me. Working the steps resulted in personal growth and opened a door to a world I didnt even know existed. I read everything I could get my hands on about recovery. Anyway I have blabbered on here.

6552567,0,t3_45ddj8,That depends on the definition of moderation. Drinking a couple of beers and stopping  I sincerely see no fun in that. If you define moderation as drinking heavily but rarely  I sometimes wish I could do like a filthy drunk night once a month when everyone leaves me alone  me my computer and a ton of beer  and then comes back the next day. That would be fun. But first of all I know very well I couldnt keep it to one night a month and then there would be leftovers that I would feel I should drink so as not to waste them and pretty soon Id be drinking daily again. Besides it would be very bad for my health. Had pancreatitis once would like to never have it again thank you. It just cant work the way I want it to. So basically the only way I can drink is destructively otherwise I dont really want to. I KNOW I dont want to repeat the old ways so I guess I just dont want to drink even in moderation.,stopdrinking,czx380i,1,t5_2s7yr

6595920,0,t3_460jq5,I personally bring Becks nonalcoholic beer with me to social events and drink probably  of them over the course of an entire night. Any time I feel bad that I cant participate in the drinking I just sip on one of those. Ive found since quitting that I just really miss beer not the alcohol in the beer. If Im actively craving alcohol though I just dont show up to the party.I also still smoke marijuana  Im a medical patient with a neurological condition and it is legal to smoke  in my state reguardless. So I generally just sip on my Becks boozy beer and smoke a little bit of weed and that makes it easy for me to avoid drinking.The trick though for me is to only go to parties with people who arent total drug addicts andor alcoholics. I dont hang out with my old alcoholic group of friends. Rather I hang out with my friends who enjoy getting drunk from time to time but arent all about alcohol and getting smashed. That also makes it easier because Ive found that problem drinkers and social drinkers have an entirely different vibe and mindset when it comes to drinking and that makes a difference to me. I also attend an AA meeting before I go out and remind myself of all of the reasons that Im not drinking anymore. I actually find that Im more social and happier and more able to feel comfortable meeting new people when Im not drinking because Im not worried that Im going to get drunk and make an ass of myself. I spent a lot of time at home drinking by myself because I was depressed that I couldnt make friends. Going to social events and realizing that I can finally open up and connect with people sober the way that I used to try to do drunk has been a huge force to keep me from drinking. Ive been going to concerts with other sober people and dancing all night and realizing how much more fun and how much more comfortable I am with myself when I go do fun stuff and dont drink. Everyone drinks for different reasons. My antialcohol has been beer that doesnt get me drunk because I love the taste and going and doing the fun things that I love with sober people. That might not work for you but it has been working great for me so far! D,stopdrinking,d01km5w,1,t5_2s7yr

6699949,0,t1_d0bn0nr,OK so I havent seen this doc but I dont think theres much point in giving alcohol such credit with such little evidence for its positive role in society. Im personally more inclined to think a drug that reduces reaction time visual acuity and sexual performance surely is not good for the survival of a species. Heres my personal disclaimer not science theory there is a clear link between alcohol use and aggressive behaviour in males and crying in females. I see a clear link with our overwhelmingly maledominated society.Seems more likely than writing being invented to write down beer recipes for gods sake... i mean you think the ancient pyramidbuilding civilisations across the world might have had higher technologies to record than how to make beer?I dont think it does you any good to put alcohol on such a high podium and then put yourself down for not being able to drink in moderation. Its an addictive substance.rant,stopdrinking,d0cbzn6,1,t5_2s7yr

6823362,0,t3_497xgv,You have taken the first and most important steps  quite a number of them  and you should remember that and hold on to them as credit for yourself. Youve realized you cant carry on like this youve spoken up to your wife youve decided to stop  and youve spoken up here. Thats a lot of achievements you should keep reminding yourself of.Its not easy to stop though  Im sure you know this. Gather all the support you can. If your wife would be keen to support you and help you get through it it would be good if she could equip herself so that she can do it effectively. To this end I could suggest a website called cadenceonline.com to help her to help you. The site offers many useful resources for loved ones of addicts and also a course called Parent CRAFT. The course teaches skills to support and communicate with an addict efficiently and also has a strong focus on positive affirmation. It is videobased interactive sciencebacked and very affordable. Ive done the course myself. Its designed for parents and caregivers of addicts but the help is obviously universal. Im suggesting this as the journey could be taxing for you both and she would probably also feel more confident in herself if she were equipped to help you.Just put one sober foot in front of the other. Keep the steps sober. You can do this. I bet youve done many good and great things in your life  and you can do this too. ,stopdrinking,d0pq6ag,3,t5_2s7yr

6835869,0,t1_d0r0thb,It seems like you have recognized what your problem is intellectually but you havent given yourself enough credit to beat it realistically.  Yes for the sake of your family things have to change.  But its also for the sake of you.  If things get to be too much for them to handle they can leave you to your own devices and you are still stuck with yourself and your addiction.  Thats what alcohol wants.  For you and it to be happy together just the two of you.  I only have two months so theres not really much that I can say beyond my own selfrealizations.  My first step was understanding that I am very hard on myself.  I expect perfection from myself but I am quick to forgive others.  I engage in selfsabotage via drinking and procrastination.  I started with online therapy at betterhelp.com and I am about to get a sponsor.  I have read  pages of the Big Book.  I have only started but if you want to beat this you have to start doing the work.  You need a plan. Its not about just stopping its about looking at the reasons as to why?  Low selfesteem lack of personal connections poor habits  not happy with your job?  Do the work talk to your family read and post here inhale the tough love realize that you are not perfect and start to move past it.   Drinking is not the disease it is a symptom of thinking you are not good enough to live a life second to none.  You are good enough you do deserve it. ,stopdrinking,d0r5bu6,2,t5_2s7yr

Mindfullness is so very important in recovery because I really do believe there is a kind of dichotomy in my head between two different brains.  There is the lizard subconscious brain where my disease lies then the human god conscience brain where recovery lies.  If I dont stay mindful and do the things you mentioned in the post I will slip into subconscience lizard mode where it is much easier to end up drinking.  ,stopdrinking,d0sfpuz,5,t5_2s7yr

6866793,0,t3_49tc9u,Thanks for sharing glad youre here. Your story reminded me of a couple of things I heard when I was newly sober that were helpful to me. . You cant save your face and your ass at the same time. I was always very focused on looking good. Years later I joked that my  addiction was appearances. I had to learn in sobriety that sometimes things would get messy while I was reorienting my life so I could be healthy and happy. Over time in sobriety we can make decisions to be around people who drink normally even go to bars and other places that earlier would have been slippery. But this takes time. And until then sometimes we have to make choices to steer clear of peopleplacescircumstances that trigger us. If your boyfriend were truly supportive of your sobriety walking on eggshells wouldnt be a problem. Hed be happy to do it. He also sounds like a normie who doesnt get why you cant moderate otherwise he would never suggest it as a viable option. Normies are like this its not their fault. . If you dont take care of yourself you wont be good to anyone else. Its understandable to hate your addiction. But from what you describe youll never be normal as you wish. Sorry  Thats the first thing we have to surrender. It is the obsession of every alcoholic to both enjoy and control hisher drinking. From BB Youre in the obsession. It will be difficult to move forward until you surrender to the fact that from the first drink all bets are off. Moderation will never happen for you. Somewhere deep down you know this. From that point of surrender you can make decisions about how to orient the other people and things in your life to support that decision. I had to let go of LOTS of people  including most of my alcoholic relatives  when I first got sober. Put creating the space allows for other supportive sober people to fill the vacuum. ,stopdrinking,d0untnz,5,t5_2s7yr

Feels like the cravings are getting worse and its worrying me.Im currently going through the same problem. Last time I slipped up was on new years eve. And before then I was almost  days sober. And before that time I was  days sober. Each time I slipped up was when I was feeling those exact same cravings. From my experience its not sudden but like waves on a beach. Slowly eroding. Its long and tough battle. Just reward yourself for beating each temptation. My reward system has cost me some weight gain but its better than drinking. And I can always start working out and drop the weight again. Maybe even look better than before.   I can not however allow myself drink again. Anyway youre not alone.

6937941,0,t3_4aqtg4,Honestly I just started by stopping. I dont mean that to sound flippant. Ive only been at this for  weeks and with several attempts before. This is the longest Ive gone without a drink for a couple of years now. There was something about the last time I drank that made me just decide to stop. I ran out of my beverage but decided not to head out to the store to grab more. Now I wake up and decide not to drink. This forum has been helpful. I try to log on every day and post on the daily checkin. I have found this sub to be really supportive and encouraging as well as nonjudgmental. I have some good friends a decent therapist and the strong desire to be the best dad I can be for my young daughter. And when she started to refer to everything I drank as beer and told me my breath smells like beer and told her grandparents Dad is always buying beer at the coop and Liquors  that shit caught up with me and hit me. Hard. Thinking about it now that might be what the final thing was for me. Its totally possible to stop. You can do it. You really can. And if you take a drink again you can stop again. That whole one day at a time thing is real. ,stopdrinking,d12qrzq,5,t5_2s7yr
6939172,0,t3_4ap1jj,gt Why did you stop? You really liked drinking beer. I didnt really answer but I wanted to say Yeah thats the point.You can look at it that way. Or you can look at it that you stopped because you didnt like drinking. I mean looking at drinking as a whole processes of intoxication to detoxification maybe you liked it  of the process and hated  of the process. So that would mean you didnt like drinking as a whole. You know what I mean? I dont just look at drinking alcohol as just the part where you are pouring it down your throat and feeling some buzzdrunkeness. Just trying to put a different angle to it.

If I go to a ladies lunch where wine is being served I politely decline the wine and that is that. The other night I was at a dinner party and I mentioned that I hadnt been drinking because of my health and this sparked a general discussion around the table about recent health trends. Really getting pressure hasnt been an issue at all for me.

6951697,0,t3_4af1ic,Wauw so many reactions thank you so much! Ive read all of your responses and its great to have so many who understand.I havent had a drink this week but that wasnt so difficult I can easily not drink for a while. I was at work had my kids and didnt go out. When boyfriend would have a beer I really didnt care so much. I feel rather calm and relieved that I dont have to or want to drink. Things seem clear.But... now its Friday my kids or going to their dad and so normally I would go out tonight and tomorrow night. And drink of course. I told two friends that Im sick off ending up drunk and not having control. They get it. I think they are exactly the same as I am. So they absolutely respect my choice for at least not drinking anything for a month.Yes I still have the illusion that maybe once I can have a couple of beers. Allthough deep down inside I know that this is not the case. But after a whole week without a single drink I feel strong and still think I could have the control back. Guess this sounds familiar too to many of you.So its the weekend and I dont know have things are gonna go. Tomorrow night theres a big thing where everybody is gonna go. Concerts deejays and of course a lot of alcohol. Should I go and see how it goes or maybe just avoid it? At this moment I really think Ill be strong enough to say no. But thats now sitting in the kitchen alone in the morning  Zero temptation.Once again thank you so much for all of your responses!!!!!Take care.,stopdrinking,d14b2gp,1,t5_2s7yr

6965533,0,t3_4b400s,Problems never magically disappear. When I was drinking they were only hidden while I was drunk and I didnt have to feel them.  I had accumulated  years of problem avoidance.  It has been  months since I stopped that and started actually dealing with the. I spent over a year getting therapy so I could work on my self and get myself bette I highly recommend looking into Inner Bonding. Today the wife and I had our first couples therapy since Im now ready to start working on us.The drinking was just avoidance. For me I was avoiding and numbing myself to some pretty crushing depression and childhood issues that I had never really come to grips with. Your story will be different but the pattern is the same.  I still miss those really good craft beers.  I still wonder sometimes if I am an alcoholic.  I still have day dreams about what if my family died wife amp kids and I moved somewhere else and started over. Would I drink? What about when Im retired and really old?I dont know if those ever go away but I do know that it is a process inside me that isnt healthy.  It is focused on short term gratificationexcitementfun but long term major problems.All that said it is a struggle.  Push through it. Work on what you need to. Get help go to meetings socialize in a safe way. Examine your triggers and why they trigger you. Defuse them.  You may need to say goodbye to some people and hello to new ones.

6966136,0,t3_4aw7z9,I married a guy and hid my addiction from him. Ten years into the marriage I quit drinking. It turned out that the sober me is a very different person than the drunk me. A different person with different priorities goals and needs. A much less guilty easily manipulated shame based person. This ended up making the marriage unworkable and we divorced. Based on this I can only recommend that you deal with your addiction before making any sort of decisions about marriage. There are many options for this. You may or may not require social support in the form of a support group. If at any time you feel a support group might be helpful you can try SMART Recovery my own preference or AA. A professional therapist may be very helpful too.I would suggest being honest with your SO. Lets be honest the reason that you dont want to tell him is that you feel that the addiction makes you a bad person. Youre not a bad person. Youre a human being who suffers from a very common disorder. It will help immeasurably if you think of yourself with compassion and not view this as something to hide from in shame.,stopdrinking,d15y3zz,1,t5_2s7yr

6979145,0,t3_4b9yoy,You are not alone in this. I can relate so much. It sounds silly but staying sober feels like youre saying goodbye to that life and the good times that went along with it. Of course there were bad times for me but I had a lot of fun with my SO too. I wont succeed at this if I harp on every situation that I feel wont be the same in the future without booze. I also lose my patience a bit when I hear him coming home shuffling around the kitchen late. It does feel like Im being left out when I know hes surrounded by our friends who are doing the same. Neither one of us drink as much as we did the first few years we were dating and drastically cut back when we had our son. But lets face it Dads usually have. A lot more freedom period. So I am trying to concentrate on whats best for me. And I hope everything else falls into place with it. The fact is my son is priority number one.  I wish you luck. Its not easy but Im going to keep putting in the work. ,stopdrinking,d17faju,1,t5_2s7yr

7134405,0,t3_4d9467,My experience is that it doesnt get better without directed attention to the problem. I nearly blew it all up in collegewas in an Ivy League school and drank my way through my first year went away for my second year and got my act together to come back and finish. I dont think about how things could have been better if I hadnt handicapped myself but they could have been different very different. I think now that its more about the selfreflection and selfknowledge that I chose to forgo at that time. That didnt help me set direction for what was next. People who tell you about the state of your problemwhy would you listen? Theyre really telling you about the state of their problem or their state of knowledge which is not great. If you believe you have a problem labeled alcoholic or notthen you have a problem. Nobody can tell you differently and those that do are not insightful or experienced and they may not be your friends but rather just drinking buddies. People seem to get hung up on the label alcoholic. Maybe one way to deal with other people is to not have to defend that label. Why not I dont want to drink. Im a nondrinker. Or I dont like drinking. And Hm why is what I do so important to YOU? While youre thinking if necessary Fuck off and leave me alone. I wouldnt be surprised if there were some resources and groups supporting not drinking at your college. You student health center might be a good place to start. ,stopdrinking,d1p3q1e,3,t5_2s7yr

7161767,0,t3_4dl9oc,I got a little over two months last year.  Ultimately went on a weekend trip with my wife to see old friends and made the conscious premeditated decision that I would have wine when we went out to a nice dinner. Mostly because I never reconciled myself to the idea of being sober forever. I still havent.Like everyone else here I can drink all I want or I can drink nothing or I can drink moderately but the last is the only one I cant maintain.  If I can drink when I go out or on special occasions then why the heck cant I have one after work?  Or two or three or a hundred after work and why cant I...  fuck it Im pounding a couple shots at am on my way out the door to work.Anyway I guess my thought is that when you stand on that precipicewhere youve gotten the compulsion out from under yourself but find yourself without that perfect record that keeps you focused thats really crunch time.  I know for myself the day I take a sip of anything is the day I start an inevitable slip right back to the place that eventually brings me back here.  But it doesnt have to.  Youve got  guiltfree days under your belt.  If you ask me so whether tomorrow you have  or  doesnt change that.Good luck and congratulations!

We are good people a with bad disease. I found it helpful to focus on the presenttoday. I cant change anything about the past. In time with sobriety I gained back the respect of others and made amends but not until I had some solid sobriety on the calendar. It takes time. All we have is today. So staying sober is the best thing we can do. Crying is good emotions bubble up. I didnt know how to get well on my own so rehab a therapist and AA taught me how to have a sober happy life.

I got to about  months then let things slip for a couple months my only relapse.  Ive got over a year now which I never thought was possible.  My brain has healed and Ive worked through many deep seated subconscious issues that were causing horribly selfsabotaging behaviors.Now Im in a space I never thought would have existed before with a new found sense of self.

I was willing to let all those relationships go for a while and some of them actually came back..some never spoke to me again. It gave me a chance to see who was a true friend. I also got myself into treatment. I moved into a detox house on the pacific. I started going to AA meetings every day. I hung out with ONLY sober people and some discovered that I wanted nothing to do with normal people at that time. They just didnt get it..If youre a social person such as I am..you need to get involved in some sort of recovery group..whether its AA smart recovery IOP whatever..just give it a shot with other sober people!I wish you the best and dont be afraid to reach out!!,stopdrinking,d281sh3,1,t5_2s7yr

It was a year before I was willing to put myself in a position to test my resolve.  By then I was strong and confident in my tools and support network.  There are a lot of support tools out there.  For me the most cost effective is AA.  In the beginning I went to daily meetings.  I still go several times a week but for different reasons.  Early on it was to keep me from drinking a negative energy and now its a positive energy because I have a lot of sober friends with whom I share joy and laughter AND to be there for newcomers who need support.See where  uashesinflames commented on this here a couple days ago its at this link I dont use AA  Im not selling AA.

7359440,0,t3_4g3e9f,Im going to have to disagree with you somewhat. Im powerless over alcohol whether or not I have it in my system. Being unable to stop once I start drinking  is the lesser aspect of my disease. The greater aspect dwells in my mind  the mental obsession.As it says in the Big Book I have lost the power of choice in drink. My experience abundantly confirms that when relying on my own power alone I will drink again. Maybe tomorrow or next month. Or maybe two years from now.The Beast as I refer to this insidious obsession is cunning baffling and powerful. But most of all hes patient. Hell wait until Im just disconnected enough whether from the fellowship the program which are very different things and my Higher Power. It is only by connecting to a Higher Power through the  Steps that I am given power. And it is only by maintaining that connection I stay sober.I do not choose to stay sober. The choice is no longer their. I have been placed in a position of neutrality safe and protected. The choice I have is to rely on my Higher Power of myself.

My first one was  years ago so it is a little different than your situation.  What my lawyer had me do was complete all of the court requirements before my court date with the judge.  In my state having multiple DWIs requires you to attend a  week alcohol awareness class and attend a MADD victim panel class.  It might be different in your state but it might be worth it to check with your lawyer to see if you can do that.  It certainly helped in my case.  Also if you are up for it get an attendance sheet for AA and start going to meetings a couple times a week.  Get the chair person to sign the sheet in each meeting.

7496504,0,t3_4i1ton,My favorite trick is to make alternate plans that involve things that I wouldnt be able to do if I drink. Im a Friday and Saturday night binge drinker. Monday through Thursday I never even think twice about it. Friday or Saturday thats all I want to do. So what I do to stay away is make plans early Saturday or Sunday morning for something fun. And the key for me is fun. It cant be Go for a run or Paint the house because neither of those things I find to be motivating enough to make me not find an excuse to drink the night before. If Im going for a hike or impulse buying at one of my favorite stores that works. Essentially Im bribing myself. Unfortunately that doesnt always work. Eventually I run out of suitable bribes and the same ones over and over dont work. My plan isnt flawless but Im working on it. ,stopdrinking,d2ubaib,3,t5_2s7yr

Reading is scientifically proven to reduce your heart rate and by extension it reduces stress.

Now I want to explore my mind my beliefs act on my curiosities. The only way I made it this far every day is a new record for me now is by trying again and again and not letting my relapses get to me. Mistakes happen.

And man no one is judging you harshly about being an alcoholic  if anything theyre impressed at your ability to not drink.

7588652,0,t3_4j1ooa,If day drinking in the summer it was cider. It started when magners first came out. On holiday then cocktails. But all that was before I hit problem city and could stop if I started. Once I had to start drinking in the daytime to curb the with withdrawals ala recent times at first one bottle of light cider and fine til I get mental on the vodka come the evening then came the time that wouldnt do it so then it had to be half a bottle of wine eventually leading on to spirits. After the detox in hospital from pancreatitis it took a few months to end up needing the day drink again but this time I did not progress further than the wine thankfully. When I started needing that again I knew I was screwing up big time again. And now Im here and Ive just remembered an untouched bottle of prossecco in the fridge I got for a treat the other week like thats seven quid up the swanny and theres no one to give it to. And even if there was would I want to give it to them because my new clarity has gone all I hate the waste of money but I cant condone me giving someone a bottle of poison as a nice gesture now. It being there is fine right now while Ive no inclination to touch it but I know from the rest of you a time will come.

Either one of them on their own would be a gigantic shakeup.  Both of them in the same span of time?  Having time to just be happy doing me and not getting distracted by pretty people expectations and dissapointments...that is important.  Ending a relationship is hard.  Sobriety for me was a breakup with my best friend Alcohol.  It was a heartbreaking sundering of my old ideas my old thoughts of what happy was...and I struggled with it.  I actually had to write a breakup letter to booze.  I needed to stay single for a while and learn how to be independent without using the crutch of alcohol to cope with everything.  Working with a therapist working a  step program and building a system of support through friends and family has been instrumental in my recovery and it has kept me going through some terrible times.  Throwing a brand new person into that mix early on would have been a mess for me but everyone is different.

7678831,0,t3_4khu0z,Its an incredibly difficult challenge and probably all of us here have gone through it. You wake up feeling terrible because of alcohol only to find a drink in your hand by the end of the day if not much much earlier. That partly comes from physical dependence. Your body comes to associate alcohol with feeling normal so theres a strong impulse to drink because your body knows that you will feel better in the short term once you do. And very early stage sobriety really isnt pretty. Part of me knew that I was in for an extremely difficult slog for the indefinite future after taking that first step. So my very tricky alcoholic brain would get to work rationalizing why it should be just one more day. Take your pick as to the reason. Sometimes Id resign myself to being a loser and give up. Sometimes Id determine that it was the only way to help myself feel physically better. Sometimes itd be because another day would naturally make for so much better a day like starting at a weekend. It really didnt matter.What you get in return for sticking with this in the immediate shortterm is the sense of accomplishment that comes with it. Somebody recently told me that their thirty day chip is their favorite. Damn straight. The first weeks and months are an incredible struggle that will yield you longterm benefits in exchange for shortterm pain that is extremely intense. Your struggle will probably never be harder than it is going to be during these first few days. We alcoholics are sometimes derided as losers and failures and whatever other insult the righteous feel like tossing at us. But show me a person whos made it through early stage sobriety and I can say for certain  regardless of any differences of political social or religious opinion  that said person has real strength and is no loser.,stopdrinking,d3f1cqt,10,t5_2s7yr

7751134,0,t3_4lguhc,I never drank at work.  I havent been arrested or pulled over.  I have never lost my job or my house or my marriage although it sure as hell came close!!  I didnt normally buy bottom shelf cheap plastic liquor.  That said my drinking was a problem FOR ME.  I drank to excess when I drank and it was damaging to my life to my mental well being to my relationships and to my self esteem.  It is easy to compare ourselves to others when we listen to others share in AA.  Well Ive never been homeless and drinking out of a paper bag..so I guess Im ok!  But there are people from ALL walks of life in the rooms.  Dishwashers at restaurants...politicians and police officers.  Lawyers doctors newspaper carriers and garbage collectors.  Addiction doesnt have qualifications.  It doesnt discriminate by paycheck race lifestyle or job title.  The only requirement for membership to AA is a desire to stop drinking.  I had that desire.  I quit drinking.  I am reaping the benefits.  It doesnt matter how much or how little others drankused.  My own behavior and my own need to get clean and sober..THAT is what I focus on.  So I listen to others share..and I take what wisdom I can from their stories.  But I avoid allowing my brain to compare my addiction to that of the person beside me. Some are sicker than others...and I was very sick in my own way.  ,stopdrinking,d3n8vna,2,t5_2s7yr

Usually when we see a newcomer who is torn between a decision to pursue moderation or abstinence we suggest considering a   or  day challenge of not drinking just to see if you are able to stop and whether that period of not drinking gains you some clarity.

7885791,0,t1_d421325,Well thats a story of its own haha.  Took about   months into my moderation aka relapse for her to see the reality of it.  I was trying really hard to actually moderate but for me  or  beers a night instead of  was the best I could do  plus some pretty bad weekend binges  and that is just not moderation.  Long story short she got fed up and left.  I was in a lose lose situation hahaIve discussed the true nature of my problem with her more openly since then and she apologized sincerely for the pressure she put on me to drink.  She thought I was just doing it to be healthy because early in our relationship that was the excuse I used to avoid Hey I know weve only been dating a few months but by the way I have a very serious drinking problem.  Were going to remain friends because relationship stress can be very risky for new sobriety but shes since said that she would definitely want to be with me if I were sober.  So while my original post shone her in a pretty negative light theres a lot more to that story.Cheers though!

7938845,0,t1_d481kgu,gtShe just made zero effort to accommodate my beliefs which I now understand is because the programsteps really dont allow for it.I actually disagree with the programsteps really dont allow for it because I was always told to take what you want and leave the rest.  And God could stand for good orderly direction.  Or group of drunks.  I also figured that a doorknob could be your higher power  if the doorknob would help keep you sober.And my Fifth Step was me telling my sponsor what Id written down.  After each thing she would share a story  either from her own experience or from her sponsors.  Basically it taught me that Im not unique.  If Ive felt or thought something chances are that someone has felt or thought that way before me.  So to me the Fifth Step is about learning that Im not a horrible person and that no matter what I may have done I can be forgiven and Im okay.Enough of that.  I would most certainly have been turned off of AA if Id had experiences like yours.  I sincerely hope you figure out what works for you.Im glad youre going to see someone for your depression.  I hope youll also consider medication if need be  clinical depression isnt anything to take lightly and its just plain not fun.Something to consider eventually is maybe seeing someone who has experience with addiction.

7984674,0,t3_4ol3t3,Its pretty common to feel tired right after quitting drinking. For one thing drinking screws up sleep and prevents good quality sleep. So early sobriety is a sleep catchup time. Resting when you can drinking plenty of water eating good quality food and getting gentle exercise like taking a walk will all help.If youre already three days sober youre past the worst parts. Picking up alcohol again just to taper down would just be an excuse to start drinking again. And it would prolong the pain.

Keep in mind Im not a medical professional I can only speak to my experience and YMMV. You dont feel that you can go cold turkey right away.  This may or may not be true.  I think that a lot of people think that this is the case myself included.  When I stopped drinking I didnt think I could do it unless I totally isolated myself from alcohol.  Thats what I did and I was successful.  The flip side to that is that you cant avoid alcohol forever.Something you could try would be to go cold turkey as long as you can.  If you do have a drink dont punish yourself over it.  Reduce the amount that you typically would have drank instead of  maybe  and then go back to abstinence. Youre concerned about withdrawal.  If this is the case then go and talk to your doctor about it.  The two of you could come up with a plan on how to approach your recovery.,stopdrinking,d4jl6lg,3,t5_2s7yr

The Baby Steps offered by ucoolcrosby are really helpful if you want to make the commitment to not drink.  Theres no other path on this journey than one foot ahead of the other one day at a time committing each day not to drink.  Thats the path to sobriety.  SD is a great place to come for support.

Depending on how bad it is you might consider going into inpatient treatment.  That worked for me as I needed to be physically separated from alcohol.

An extra tip I found helpful for sleep try Sleepy Time Extra Tea or Nightly Calm with lemon and make sure that your bedroom is conducive to sleep crisp clean linens a light scent relaxation  meditation music a sleep mask drawn blinds..they all make such a huge difference. I often talk about how my bedroom became my safe haven during my first few weeks because I refused to go out for fear of being tempted so I cleaned my bedroom really well got a new mattress and invested some money in window treatments and nice soft and cool linens.

This happens to be my friends best friend from high school the cop that shouldve arrested me a million times for all sorts of drunken related incidents. I even made him a drink Polars Cranberry Clementine with a splash of OJ on the rocks! He was so pleasantly surprised and I was SOBER!

Do not think your ability to manage an addiction means you can go it alone. It means that if you participate in some form of aftercare and earnestly and wholeheartedly throw yourself into recovery you have a very good chance of getting sober and staying sober.

AA is strange in my community in that it is almost all old people with no desire to sponsor others. I like meetings because it helps to be around people who are going through the same things I am. Ive heard from many people the only step you need to do right is the first step. And you have to do it everyday. So far that has been enough for me.

Yes you developed a dependence on another substance but for AA purposes you have abstained from the ONLY substance that program addresses or is meant to address. In addition to this and even if you do decide for your own reasons to change your sobriety date the notion that you have lost something and you are back at the beginning as though that  years had never happened is simply wrong.

8289588,0,t3_4t0ypv,To start I resolved to quit for a while as alcohol was costing me too much in all aspects of my life and I was fearful for the health risks. I diverted any urges with substitution drinks stocking up on sparkling water. I kept my mind occupied with distractions gaming reading TV walks. I lurked here and it helped me work through my faulty wiring. By four months I decided to remain sober for good  not only do I believe that returning to drinking will land me back where I left off I discovered being sober was quite ok. From that point I set about working on my life building in a good balance of things. I feel free.I expand on this in my Sunday Solution post,stopdrinking,d5dr9xt,3,t5_2s7yr

They were happy to hear my efforts towards bettering myself..the story behind why felt like oversharing since I really only see them at reunions and on facebook. At the time I was searching for my higher power and they were threatened by my book around theyre children which is a matter of perception. I was actually brought quietly and respectfully into the garage and asked not to talk about it around their  yr old that has never drank when I told her it was another cousin who asked for guidance she just said oh and changed the subject. On that trip I asked a lot of people about god and what they think he she it is. Ironically on the flight home I ended up sitting next to a guy in trianing to be a priest he saw my book and a four convo ensued. Later the next week the stars aligned with a series of events that I could do nothing but accept the presence of a higher power..it is there if you seek.

8306482,0,t3_4tafjc,I did EMDR and it helped IMMENSELY.   PTSD flashbacks intrusive memories amp feeling helpless to handle triggers were some of the things I was dealing with. At first it was really emotionally uncomfortable for me as it required revisiting traumatic events in my mind. Then as I could see that it was helping it became a little easier to continue with the process. The first couple times I remember I went home and slept for hours  it really took it out of me. Ive taken antidepressants in the past but for me getting a good trauma therapistdoing EMDR is what finally helped me. Im actually tearing up a little bit while writing this because its still kind of amazing to me that Im not haunted by memories all the time. Theres an online EMDR therapist network I used to find my practitioner  I think its important to ask a lot of questionsfigure out what you are trying to accomplish amp see if they might be a good fit.

8360802,0,t3_4u43oy,Nobody can get a drunk sober and definitely nobody can keep them sober. If functioning adult wants to drink theres nothing to stop him. Personally I think the roommate made a huge mistake  he should not have put himself in the position of relying on an alcoholic for rent. Other than that he didnt do a single thing wrong. Hes not a security guard and its not his job to keep anyone but himself sober. I can only imagine how difficult that might be given his living situation.Adding I get that this is a frustrating situation and that more than anything else you want to understand. But blameshifting doesnt help. I think I sounded like a dick above and Im sorry about that. Addiction is the dick it makes people unrecognizable.,stopdrinking,d5mnhpo,6,t5_2s7yr

I had put off telling my father for a long time and it felt good to finally  have it out in the open.This was my thought at the timegtTake action has become my mantra to get my shit together lately. Funny how I still built up my walls around this one to avoid it. Part of my problem is that telling him makes my sobriety very much official in my mind. If I tell him and fail it will be all the more painful. But I guess thats why it needs to be done.Alcoholism thrives in the shadows.

You DO have control over that next thought and that next action. For me the hardest thing recovery is forcing myself to do things that dont come naturally when I am feeling uncomfortable  reaching out to a sponsor sharing at a meeting etc  but its exactly those things that keep people sober long term.

Not sure whats different this time   but on Day  I found this sub and started reading This Naked Mind and coolcrosby from this sub asked if I had a plan so I made a plan. All three of those things were important and now finding strength and a reason not to drink every single morning and checking in.  After that the decision is made for that day so I dont even consider it  anyway thats whats getting me through for now. I guess it comes down to finding something you trust enough to follow more than that first little voice. ,stopdrinking,d6728lq,1,t5_2s7yr

Ive been actually drinking less coffee these days though I think due to the no hangovers and it not being a necessity and the fact that its such a smoking trigger for me.

And when I forget that I go to friends or places like this I think of it as an AA meeting  with the added bonus of nonAA people who also have much wisdom and I find the support I need to carry on.Those are my thoughts.

I and I suspect most of the people here too have had my fair share of mornings where I woke up disorientated and ashamed and scared because of the excesses of the night before feeling like death and praying for it to end. It was a cycle like you say Id destroy myself with drink sober up and resolve to improve keep a lid on it for a day or two and then come Thursday or Friday Id be feel better and climb right back into the bottle rinse repeat ad infinitum. To begin with I didnt have much of a plan I found this sub I read and commented I concentrated on getting my sweaty bald head down on the pillow sober at the end of the day one day at a time in the early days. I didnt think too much about stopping forever or making any grand announcements or start defining myself as an alcoholic or any of that stuff. I just knew I needed to lay off the sauce because it was wrecking my life and that moderation always snowballed back into debauchery one way or another for me. With time and help and a bit of effort Ive broken that cycle despite thinking it could not be done. Hang in there mate you can do this. Stick around were all here right by you.,stopdrinking,d7jepiq,3,t5_2s7yr

Ive always been very promarijuana over medications in every sense and I know that once I am in inpatient I will more than likely be prescribed crap for depression and anxiety. My reasons for quitting drinking is simple my life is completely unmanageable with alcohol in the picture and I become an emotional wreck after binging for a straight  hrs.

8931525,0,t3_52k9mw,What I have learned in my  months of sobriety is that rock bottom is different for everyone.  that moment of realization that you just cant life in chaos anymore.  When as one of mentors says the pain if greater than the fear and thats when you reach out for help. Change only happens when the pain of holding on is greater than the fear of letting go.I realized this Oct.  of .   MONTHS after I got of jail for a DUI.  Even though I spent time behind bars that wasnt enough for me to quit drinking. Last summer after I got out the first thing I did was celebrate my freedom by drinking a bottle of wine.  How crazy is that?  The very thing I got put in jail for and I still desired it when I got out.  And thus started my true downward spiral...where I spent the next  months drinking daily to blackout and not caring at all about anyone or anything especially myself.  I was just so damn angry at the world that I just didnt care at all.   It wasnt until I almost lost my wife family job...everything...that I finally said ENOUGH. months ago I walked into a Celebrate Recovery program here in my hometown and have been going every week since.  that may not be the answer for you...but I can tell you without reservation CR saved my life.  For I am sure that I wouldnt be here today without support. As my sponsor says our addictions lead to  things.  Jail institutions or death.  Ive been to jail dont wanna go back.  Came damn close to being in a padded room.  and Im just too gosh darn pretty to die.This may be your rock bottom or it may not be.  You will only know when you hit it when you stop digging.  Thats what I had to realize drowning away the pain only made the pain worse.  The folks around here in SD are great as well as my family in CR.  They will help hold you up if you let em.  gt Im staying sober today I really have no idea how to start this sobriety thing. The way you do this sobriety thing?  One freaking day at a time.  Its all you can do.  Reach out to others.  Find a support group that works for you.  get a sponsor  accountability partner that will be there to talk to you in the tough times.  LOTS of sparkling water    And Hope.Oh and I watch this pretty much weekly.  FTZStay strong.  Be sure to tell the addict in your brain it helps if you name em mines Pedro the alcoholic jackass to Piss Off when he  she wants you to fail and keep coming back here and reaching out.

9026708,0,t3_53whff,Yes. When I first stopped drinking those thoughts were all I could think about.I manage those thoughts with the LLAMP method a fivestep model that can help you to interrupt the control instinct that is part of the fightorflight response and become more accepting of your thoughts and feelings while also becoming more focused on the presentmoment and taking actions that are guided by your values rather than by the avoidance of anxiety.The five steps are contained in the acronym LLAMP Label anxious thoughts Let go of control Accept and observe thoughts and feelings Mindfulness of the present moment Proceed in the right direction... With practice the steps begin to flow one into another so that applying LLAMP becomes a fluid process. Labeling certain thoughts as anxious thoughts is a cue to Let go of the control response which makes room for Acceptance and Mindfulness of your thoughts feelings and experience in the present moment which allows you to Proceed with valued purposeful action.Source of that quote not where I learned the method but a good summary,stopdrinking,d7wv9yp,6,t5_2s7yr

9097152,0,t1_d85bi7t,Thank you! Hmm I have a lot of tips but theres a phrase I think of when Im having trouble discipline is the difference between what you want now and what you want most. Sure Id love a drink to calm down especially after going to my uncles funeral last week but what I want most is to wake up proud of myself wake up without a hangover maintain my sobriety and keep improving my life. It helps me with the mindset of I could get away with it it would help me get through this hard time I wouldnt drink too much etc. Even if Im able to justify it with this or that reason the saying helps me realize that by drinking Im still distancing myself from what I want most. Its really helped me a lot and also in other areas of life like exercise what do I want now? a nap but what do I want most? a hot body alright Im going to the gym. Thats my most useful way to frame things but I have other tips if you want to talk more. Another saying  question to ask myself is what would I do in this situation if I loved myself  that helps combat my depression. It pushes me to do shit just because Ill be proud of it later even if its the last thing I want to do. Its like I can have a sort of outofbody experience get something done and then wake up to being like woah I did something for my own good and tomorrow is going to be better as a result as are all of my tomorrowsEdit Woah!

9105595,0,t3_54zq9d,Sorry to hear of your troubles. There is a place beyond this situation.My wife got a DUI last year. There was no accident no damage she sped and made a goofy lane change. For her it was a wakeup call. Dealing with it wasnt super much in my wheelhouse either. I probably could have been a better support through it and it brought up a lot of stuff for me as well. Partly for me it was that on any number of occasions it might have been me in that situation. Anyway it shows that you have some good perspective when you can see that it is challenging for your boyfriend.Its expensive. It sucks.You might want to figure out an attorney. My wife did and her outcome was better than it might have been if she had not.You screwed up and let your parents down and wrecked the car and hurt yourself and it can and will get better.

I dont mind at all that you asked this question!Three things strike me as things you may not have considered For me though I drank heavily by medical standards I did not like getting rip roaring fall down drunk. In fact I avoided that as I did not like the hangover. So while I did in fact feel bad it wasnt that bad most days. I think  drinks was my average something I drank over about  or  hours most nights and Im a large male. This became my new normal. That is I didnt really know that I could feel much better than that. While I was actually drinking I was a night drinker not a day drinker I did feel good. ,stopdrinking,d8dvovt,2,t5_2s7yr

Again nobody was hurt thankfully the cops werent called but I got out and blamed it on him very angrily and made him drive me home! Where I got in the shower and cried about what a mess I was making of my life. Not sure why im telling you this but since then I vowed to never drive drunk again never did. Since the end of August I vowed never to drink again so far so good.  But yeh that feeling of regret and anger with myself for what I did and the danger I put others in my wife was in the car with me so very shameful. That hurt and hit home very hard.

Right now you are you at  days. This may or may not be who you are at  days.  It took me  months to even physically recover from decades of alcohol abuse! Mentally it was a slow process.  My moods went up and down and I went through all kinds of experimenting with new interests and stuff.  I feel my being began to stabilize at around  months.

9242082,0,t3_56wdyu,I agree with everything you said. So much time is spent thinking about drinking even after becoming sober. Although this is probably gonna be an unpopular opinion here if you absolutely feel like you need to drink and can limit it to just one occasion Ive found that to actually be beneficial every couple of months because it reminds me of how stupid I get when I drink relieves all of the built up stress and reminds me of how much of a waste of money it is. Personally I think its a better approach than accidentally relapsing and then feeling stuck in it and continuing to buy more alcohol but there are different strokes for different folks. One of the biggest issues with alcoholism is the shame you feel if you do relapse and that often will cause more drinking. You are in control of your drinking not the other way around. Also congrats on being sober for about a month! Not drinking with you today. You have come so far and I hope you realize that. Even being sober for just one month requires a lot of selfrestraint so good work.Essentially I agree  that the obsession of staying sober makes life more difficult.

I felt I had a problem for many years but a lot of my close friends and family drink a lot so I think it was in their interests of masking their own issues with it to have me drinking just as much or more beside them. My wife doesnt want to turn around and call me an alcoholic she always said I would do the right thing one day and that I know what im doing which I guess means curb it or stop it at some point. But she never outright told me to. I had to come to that conclusion by myself. It still took me a long time to act on my thoughts and actually stop. Its also taken a few goes at it but now I feel Ive accepted it is a problem for me.This is tricky to reply to without breaking the I rule but I found I had to make the decision regardless of the opinions of others. In the end only I knew how it was impacting my life and outlook on the world and how I felt about it..and it wasnt good that was a problem so Ive chosen to change that aspect of my life.,stopdrinking,d8pzuy5,3,t5_2s7yr

And I started meditating which in a way also with some reading I did connected me with my higher self...the best most authentic person I can be. It was basically just a lot of work. And my substance abuse counselor once told me when Im alone Im with a crazy person he was in recovery too and that thats why its important to have a support group or even just one person who you can call on to talk you down when your internal supports seem to be failing.Best wishes!

You know what happened? years later... Ive quit drinking a few times getting better at it every time. One friend is dead from an alcohol related crash. Another got his th DUI and spent a year in prison for vehicular manslaughter when he killed two teenage kids while driving drunk. Another friend just texted me the other night about being afraid of her fiance because they drink to oblivion every night and hes started to get violent with her. I used to worry about what my friends would say or think. Then later in life I had to worry about what my boss would think if I showed up hungover or called in sick yet again because I was drinking too much the night before. I had to worry about what my clients would think when I had an am east coast meeting and I flew out the night before and got hammered at the hotel bar so I could go to sleep resulting in showing up probably still drunk. I had to worry about getting a DUI with my kid in the car because I had a beer or two after work and then went and got him so I could go home and drink more.Now I dont give a fuck what anyone thinks about my not drinking because I dont have to worry about those things. Sorry if thats harsh. That was my reality. Play the tape forward and then make the decision on whether its the right choice for you to be sober. ,stopdrinking,d96kh3c,1,t5_2s7yr

9420312,0,t3_59ojat,I choose very carefully who I tell. Very few people know and Ill keep it that way. If someone offers me a drink I just refuse saying I dont drink and change the conversation. Most people who do know will at first judge you according to the stereotypes theyve learned about alcoholics including their own experiences with other alcoholics. But if youre not a violent abuser people will see that too. In most cases people in my life realized that being an alcoholic actually doesnt change anything about the me they knew. I was still nice and their friend but maybe just a little more selfish and preoccupied with my addiction. Im a LOT nicer now but I wasnt some horrible monster when I drank. My girlfriend was this way when I first told her. She had an abusive alcoholic father growing up whos now sober and a currently alcoholic very dysfunctional brother. She immediately placed me in their camp and said that by dating me she was continuing the cycle of abuse despite that Ive never been abusive towards her. After several weeks she realized she was wrong and that Im really the person she always thought I was just with a problem. It was still hard to deal with at the time. ,stopdrinking,d9a38ft,5,t5_2s7yr

9434994,0,t1_d9buaqj,Good question. In terms of harm reduction theres an argument to be made that this is an improvement. The total amount of alcohol although excessive is less. Butthis doesnt account for behavior changesfor example having  drinks every night for a week  total is not equivalent to having zero drinks on six days and  drinks on Saturday. Sounds silly but its one thing I did while moderatingno drinks and then a lotta drinks all at once.And also leaving aside the ability to maintain this pattern over time. I found that one way I survived a weekend blowout was by having a few drinks on Monday. Even had a group of drinking friends who met every Monday at the bar for the sole purposewe called it Fuck it Monday. The nondrinking week got shorter. Friday is a drinking day so Thursday is close enough. Generally Tuesdays and Wednesdays nondrinking. You know unless. Thats how it worked for me. So for me it was this I couldnt maintain a moderate level of drinking. But for me its a lot easier to not drink at all than it is to drink a little. And I expect many or most people who are at the point of regular blackouts cant drink moderately every time with complete predictability. Aside from this actually moderating for any period of timeis a huge pain in the ass and does not resemble a healthy relationship with alcohol. Its obsession. Healthy for me would mean Im not drinking and Im not thinking about drinking. Moderation is the opposite Im not drinking but Im thinking about it all the time. Planning for when I can drink. Planning to drink. Seeing myself drinking. And when I have a drink thinking about the next one. Wanting another one and having to rely on will power to stop doing something my brain really really wants me to do. Willingly putting myself in that position over and overat this point its like being caged with wild rats for me. Ultimately its a question we all have to answer for ourselves. By that I mean that if you havent experienced what I describe it probably doesnt mean much and I certainly cant convince you of anything nor should I try. But if you have had some experiences like mine maybe some of this resonates and is helpful in deciding what you want to do. ,stopdrinking,d9by95v,2,t5_2s7yr

Eventually I just turned into a sloppy mess and could not imagine myself at social events without it even if there wasnt alcohol being served. I am much better off without it.

9440447,0,t3_59z320,Im sorry youre struggling. I wish I had great insight or a me too experience or something to share. Our lives are pretty different. I mean we both like men but Im an old married lady I started turning to alcohol to alleviate fear and worry. Having stopped drinking Im finding those things that used to cause me the most worry are not so bad anymore. I still worry but its not all consuming anymore.Im also finding people like sober me. Actually my family likes sober me quite a bit too. I think the biggest change outside of not being intoxicated has been that I am much more comfortable with who I am which I think draws people towards me. Oh! I just thought of another commonality  games. Im guessing you mean video games but board games are a huge thing in my family gift of marrying a gamer. Just yesterday I knocked off work early because my frustration level was too high to be productive and played a few games of The Castles of Mad Kind Ludwig. By the end of the evening I had had some fun lowered my frustration to near zero and made some quality memories with my family. Drinking would have temporarily helped but I would be so much worse off this morning had I made a different choice. ,stopdrinking,d9cn61l,1,t5_2s7yr

9451917,0,t3_5a6utl,. Yes I was scared to face my problems it was alien to me and my coping skills were poorly developed getting drunk was my goto coping mechanism for everything. I too things as easily on myself as possible and just focused on accepting the things I cant change and taking small steps on the things I could. I even mindmapped all the challenging situations I faced and mapped out alternative healthier coping ideas. The rest took time and practice and knowing that I can face any situation sober.. I had already lost a lot of drinking buddies and Id become quite isolated so I didnt have that as a big challenge. For those people I had left I just laid low for a few months and as I started venturing out more Id arrange daytime activities that wouldnt involve drinking  those people who have remained in my life are the ones who like to join me for them. .

I drank my morning brew and as the hours went by I noticed becoming more anxious than normal. I drink  mugs in the morning try to limit my intake during the day but I wondered if the heightened anxiety was related to coffee. And here you go you just asked and a lot of people kind of confirmed this. I dont know if I am ready to cut this out of my life too as it is my one solace in my day where I wake up in peace and sip my brew. But I might need to limit it or at least try to see if this will help me.

When we got there I tried to get my drunk ass out of the back seat and used the rolled up passenger side window as a lift to pull myself out. I fell back and grabbed the window to stop from falling.

9793028,0,t3_5fg6nj,Hey umadjack.Good on you for posting! Takes alot of courage and strength to admit you need help let alone posting on reddit. So good for you. Youve already got two great big positive decisions completed for today. Happy days!I have been taking LTheanine for the past  months or so and it is has made a huge difference in my life. Best you do your own research and decide if you want to spend the  or  to give it a go.It seems to work for some people like me to reduce anxiety which might just be a tiny leg up allowing you to take that one extra step of discipline in the right direction which builds into bigger steps towards the life your would prefer.I commented on this post earlier today if you care to have a readLink  As I say it seems to work for some people like me and others it has no effect. As LTheanine is a greentea extract and from what Ive read and directly experienced appears to be nonaddictive nondrowsy and have no side effects I personally think its worth the investment.As one of my wise friends once told me paraphrasing its not about stopping or giving up something its about developing and nurturing new habits each and everyday. The new habits will start to grow and as your attention on them continues other limiting or destructive habits will naturally fall by the way side.This doesnt mean its easy. But it is simple.Similar to when I up and stopped smoking cigarettes coldturkey  years ago. I didnt focus on quitting or giving up anything. I focused on running and swimming and noticing the air in my lungs and allowing myself to eat one or two pieces of chocolate everyday as my reward. I also started drinking alot of green tea at that time which kept me calm and reduced my anxiety which was a big trigger for smoking.As I said it takes alot to say what you have and admit youre not doing your best so acknowledge youve already taken two steps in the direction towards what you decide is best for you. Now take another step. Take one more step. Soon youll be a thousand steps away from your current position and a thousand steps closer to your better self.All the best and happys days!,stopdrinking,dak7bkw,2,t5_2s7yr

9842958,0,t1_daqjlwc,Im not sure if he truly wants to quit completely. I can tell he wants some kind of help. Just the fact that he came to me and admitted it is a sign because he isnt the type of person who allows people anyone to see how he really is. He fears appearing weak and asking for help is a sign of weakness to him.Most of our conversation last night was me trying to encourage him and help him understand that asking someone for help was a strength not a weakness.So I cant say that I know he wants to quit. All I know is that he wants help getting it under control and improving his health but he is too stubborn to tell most of his familyfriends because he doesnt want to be viewed as weak.,stopdrinking,daqk6s6,1,t5_2s7yr

Alcohol makes me sick results in bad consequences makes me depressed costs a lot of money allows me to make a fool out of myself causes my family pain and shuts me down to the rest of the world.

I didnt lose weight until I started tracking what I eat and then consciously decided to eat at a deficit. I thought that by simply ditching booze sugar cheese and refined carbs I would lose weight but it didnt happen. It made no mathematical or metabolical sense because I cut out like kcal a day and before that my weight was stable so I should have been losing. What I found useful is to track body composition.

That the friends I made in the program after my DUI a few years ago were still around. That my BEST FRIEND had just celebrated a year sober.So I reached out and made it to a meeting that night. At the coffee shop after I sat with friends from my first time in the program. They laughed and joked and I just sat there looking sad wondering how I was going to not drink trying not to puke. A lot of other stuff has happened since then. I ended up swearing into the Army that Friday I went to my meeting on Monday because coincidentally the waiver i needed to get into the Army given my DUI was approved Wednesday.Its been all kinds of adjustments this year but Im finding that serenity and that better way of life AA talks about.

This was the vicious cycle of alcoholism I experienced. Today I am grateful for having walked thru the fire. A character defect of mine is the kind of laziness that has me do just enough to get by but no more. Alcohol pushed me just far enough into hell to admit defeat and cry out for a power greater than myself. Be kind to yourself. Kindness is gentle but sometimes firm. I believe were all exactly where were supposed to be. ,stopdrinking,dbmtikt,2,t5_2s7yr

10112593,0,t3_5km35g,I wouldnt read too much into it. Unfortunately it often takes some kind of pressure for someone to commit to even trying to quit drinking. I think especially at the beginning people often need a lot of support whether it be from rehab or frequent meetings. I know I went to a drug counselor once and then never returned and I continued to drink for a long time after that. She probably unfortunately sees that happen a lot. But regardless of all this if her approach wasnt working for you try somebody else. Its all about finding out what works for you and your recovery! Best of luck! ,stopdrinking,dbpohui,2,t5_2s7yr

With that said I know its important to reflect on the good things in my life and to make goals to allow more great things to happen. It seems to be a great basis for sobriety. I also need to work on recollecting the bad things Ive done while drinking and make plans to avoid those things in the future. The new year seems to be the perfect time for all of that. Out with the old in with the new. Reflect make plans. Ill read some books for most of the night and then turn on the tv in just enough time to watch the ball drop.

A sponsor I had a while back who ended up being like that great Zen master Yodatype teacher and mentor used to tell me The closest we come to perfection is that we identify our mistakes and we correct them. Thats what successful people do. So that is what I have tried to do ever since.With some time I became quite adept at handling such situations and with a lot of time I find that most of those awkward situations just go away on their own or dont manifest to begin with. In fact Ill go as far as to say the tables have largely turned and at most of the social gatherings I attend or host it is now the drinker that sometimes appears to be in the awkward situation. Im never judgmental or critical as theres nothing worse than a reformed drinker openly spouting his hatred of alcohol in front of guests. Ive experienced a modicum of success in my sober life so I think some of the people I meet make the association of not drinking with success in life. In my case they would be  right! ,stopdrinking,dbv3jxk,4,t5_2s7yr

He died at the age of  due to organ failure brought on by Cirrhosis of the liver.  Its going to be a rough go for a while but its okay to grieve.  Give yourself permission to cry and to feel her loss deeply.  This will help you down the road.When my friend died I saw an opportunity.  It was an opportunity to make something meaningful and positive out of such a shitty situation.  It was an opportunity to honor him and his memory.  It was an opportunity to choose life over death.  And thats exactly what I did. I used his passing as an opportunity to get sober.  I quit drinking entirely I havent had a drink in over four years and its been one of the best decisions Ive ever made.  He wasnt able to beat alcohol but I thought Maybe I can do it for him?  When I told my friends mom the story of how his passing helped me get sober she gave me the biggest hug as tears ran down her face. It was pretty incredible to be able to share that with her and to show her that love triumphs over grief that meaning and purpose can beat out cynical nihilism and that if only for a short period of time life can beat out death.  Im so sorry that youre going through this but you can make something positive out of this.  You can do it but you have to make that decision.  I believe in you.,stopdrinking,dbyrquy,3,t5_2s7yr

I know that feeling youre describing about not being bad enough for AA. Though Ive been an alcoholic for the past  years and a daily drinker for about the last  and I did have blackouts and did things I was ashamed of later... I never ruined a relationship bc of it have never been married and havent had an SO since becoming an alcoholic havent gotten in a wreck gotten a DUI or been arrested lost a job etc. etc... But I have caused harm to my family and myself and have put a lot of strain in my family.Am I bad enough for AA? Well I dont know I havent tried it yet. But having read and learned a lot from people on this sub my thoughts are everyone in AA is different but the same. They may come from different walks of life different levels of alcohol use. BUT they all have suffered the consequences of drinking in some way and are tired of suffering. The only requirement for being in AA is truly wanting to stop drinking. Thats it. Theres no must be this drunk to ride limit on those meetings.Again I havent attended any AA meetings yet but I am open to exploring that option in the future. For now Im on this sub a lot which has really made me feel like Im getting somewhere. And Im also about to get back into counseling in the next  weeks had to stop pursuing it for a couple of months for financial and transportation reasons. I have a path to go down right now and Im already seeing that theres hope for me.If you do decide to give AA a shot or any of the other recoverysupport groups mentioned in the communitysidebar info just to see what its like I would be very interested to hear what you have to say about it.

If she lives nearby I might suggest sending her somethinga heartfelt letter letting her know youre there for her. I know a lot of people who go through this at least initially really want to be alone. NOT ALL WOMEN but many. She might need time to process this. Or not. I lost a baby once. Not nearly as far along as your friend. But boy did it crush me. I coped with that loss by retreating into myself. I really only wanted to be around certain people those who understand that loss. I also coped with it by drinking heavily. That just postponed the pain and at the end of that  month bender I felt even worse. Your friend may want company she may not. But you should reach out to her and offer her whatever she needs. I imagine she has a nursery set up. I have heard of people wanting someone to help take it down before they get home. I have heard of others wanting to hold onto it. Everyone deals with this type of loss differently.I am SO sorry youre friend is going through this and I am SO SORRY youre feeling pain. I admire your empathy however. Youre a good friend. So be there for her and drinking wont help that happen. Much love to you.,stopdrinking,dc11ssr,2,t5_2s7yr

But what I didnt think about then was how unacceptable it was even to chance these kinds of behaviors. I know what I am capable of while drunk. I know that even when I plan to drink just one or two I may end up getting trashed. So I know that anytime I pick up even one drink Im saying its ok to risk that.

I just played my lotto instead and ignored it. An hour later the owner is back over and offering shots. I say no thank you need as my mind is screaming yes. My bf decided to take one and my friend hands me her phone to take a pic of them all taking their shots. I felt like a total outcast and that my bf was being pretty insensitive by joining in. I was left out. I wanted to tell them all to fuck the fuck off and leave. I smiled through it and when we got in the car he got an earful about how shitty it made my feel.

10280296,0,t3_5n7o0i,I made the decision early on in sobriety that others decisions could not dictate my own. My partner and our friends drink in moderation but I was making a fool of myself and hurting my relationships with others when I used alcohol.I got sober through support here and by seeking therapy for the underlying issues that caused me to drink. I did attend AA for a month or two but it was not the right support environment for me. Ultimately journaling yoga writing and reading here on SD and therapy helped me develop tools and strategies that allowed me to be present with alcohol and not imbibe.I didnt want alcohol to have power over me so I made the decision to continue with my social life as normal and be okay with others decisions to drink or not. Some people stick to sober people sober places but that would have meant alienating a lot of people I care about. I remember that all I have control over is my own decision and that is not to drink.,stopdrinking,dc9btba,2,t5_2s7yr

10285699,0,t3_5n85ka,Your story is very compelling. I definitely cannot tell you what to do about your partner but I know I would have wonderings about the relationship too.  Ive been together with my SO for  years married for .  Our relationship is rocky now due to many years of not tending to the relationship followed by his infidelity.  One of the things I realize though is that there were loose pebbles under what I thought were solid rocks.  Those pebbles were laid down early and like a stone in my shoe created deep bruises.  Also now the solid rocks wobble sorry for the mixed metaphors.  The dynamics that took years to manifest were mostly related to my choiceability to be honest to express my pain to trust that I could be fully myself and that that was ok. Related to him were issues about my being able to trust that he would follow through be an active participant in the emotional side of our marriage and communicate.  In retrospect now most of these were evidenced in the first few years of our relationship a couple in the first weeks honestly.  I thought that getting married would cement the relationship and it has in many ways but as the lack of trust has grown and communication has lessened the cement often feels like a concrete block.For me trust honesty and openness are absolutely essential to a happy healthy marriage.  I hope you and your partner have that as you enter into your commitment to each other. Thats where I offer that you look. Blessings on your journey.,stopdrinking,dc9xvdi,1,t5_2s7yr

10297758,0,t3_5ngctd,Totally agree with uGodDamnBotaBox. Read through the posts old and new everyday. Youll see yourself in just about every one. It helps keep you motivated while you build up your will power. Motivation can be fleeting. You have to make not drinking a habit so that it comes naturally when your motivation subsides. There are lots of suggestions for what to do when you have cravings. For me its a brisk walk outside a big glass of ice water or yoga. I find that always having a water bottle around helps me with the physicalliteral habit of reaching for something to drink. Good luck on your journey.

Its such an awesome sense of relief and excitement once you realize you dont have to live bogged down with alcohol anymore!  Let me caution you though that this feeling could possibly crash down.  Its called the Pink Cloud.  It happens to a lot of people and it certainly happened to me.  After I hit one month which was my first goal literally  the day after it went from sunshine and rainbows to stormclouds and a feeling of grounded forever that I just couldnt shake.  I am not telling you this to discourage you but for you to be ready when this happens because it almost certainly will.  Just be ready for it and know that IT WILL PASS.  It almost took me down because I wasnt warned about it.  I thought that these new awful depressed feelings were how I was going to feel from then on and I nearly gave up.  If someone would have just told me hey its normal that this crazy switch happens I would have had an easier time.Im happy for you!  Just want you to be prepared!,stopdrinking,dcdtm70,5,t5_2s7yr

And it has literally turned my life around  degrees.Prior to that I had been in therapy for  years and it was helpful in some respects but ultimately was not catch all.My experience with therapist has been that they have not been very receptive in recommending or encouraging medical help. I have spent easily  on talk therapy and it has had helpful moments. The biggest game changer for me was finding a patient understanding doctor who was took the time to understand my needs and concerns and slowly introduce anti depressants to my system.I know a lot of people dissuade people from using this approach but for me was an actual game changer.

10369696,0,t3_5og70a,Congratulations on your  week!  Before I spent a lot of time readinglearning about the impacts of alcohol and withdrawal on my body I tried many attempts at moderation including breaks of not drinking for up to a week.  The anxiety sleeplessness and other unpleasant factors made me wonder why anyone would ever be insane enough to quit longer term...who can live forever without sleep and with overwhelming fearful thoughts???  I didnt realize at the time that those are withdrawal symptoms and I was subjecting myself to the worst of them every time I quit for a few days and never waiting long enough to get to the point where it gets better after  weeks.  So like you I started with  days it was a nobrainer for me to extend to  and now to .  I still consider trying moderating at some point now that I have reset my system as you said but not in the near future.  I think its a great exercise to try  days of no alcohol for anyone who drinks regularly just to see what it feels like!

10376598,0,t3_5ol745,Thanks for sharing! For me day  and around that period was really really hard going and my brain kept telling me this was how it was and this was being sober so why not have a drink. Well it turned out to not be true and I came out the other side of those feelings and started feeling good again even great! But again I am sure that will change again as I move forward.For me just watching the days rack up making sure I get sleep and go for a walk every day and be proud of myself for each day I made it through. No one understands what a big deal one day is apart from us. So well done on  days that would have been hard.As far as your idea that a couple of shots will take the edge off try reading The Naked Mind its free on the sidebar it really helped me reframe a lot of stuff about these feelings.

Gotta love how many of us develop our fucked up habits in the military yet can get crucified for them if they are found out. Id look into the Military one source thing it sounds anonymous. Also dont give up. For me the biggest thing is persistence. I quit smoking  times before it finally stuck. I also had  day s of sobriety before my current run. Although humble this one really feels different for me so keep trying.Finally one tiny thing to look forward to I cant fucking believe that I wont have to dip into savings this month to pay bills.

Those of us who are expert drinkers have only the other extreme just leave it all together. We are not moderate people we are extreme and given enough time we will show you. So be extreme in the right direction if anyone has anything to say its only because they see you where they want to be but arent. ,stopdrinking,dcpiph2,1,t5_2s7yr

10424992,0,t3_5p9mk1,Speaking only for myself I dont believe there even is such a thing as an alcoholic. Questioning if I am an alcoholic for me is potentially destructive. If I choose yes there are mobs of people who now assume sometimes with all good intention that they know something about me and my innermost experience. Choosing no means I may have opened a door that should remain closed at least as per my best interest. But its not a secret hidden binary something deep in the recesses of my brains genes or soul. Its another word. Sometimes it works alright and others it doesnt. Alcohol is pleasurable in controlled doses deadly at higher ones. Its a social lubricant for many and a persistent source of suffering for others. It can be addictive in many senses of the word. Or it can be harmless for some. Its a very complicated entity. I have come to think of it like a friend I no longer want to deal with. I see the good in him but I find I get tired and sick when hes around. I dont bear him any will on some level but I know whats best for me and I think that choice says more about how we get along than it necessarily does about me. Either way Im ranting. So to keep it simple  Ill drink my coffee with you today and no booze.,stopdrinking,dcpqpo7,2,t5_2s7yr

10457517,0,t3_5psdzo,Honestly I didnt start to feel even remotely comfortable in my sobriety til about  days in. Reading this naked mind and hanging around this sub really helped me get through that first month. Eventually a little bit before the  day mark I began to feel better. It started with a tiny smidgen of joy that crossed my path. Just a nice little thought that I clung on to. Then those little moments began to happen more. At this point I feel good every morning although I tend to face some difficulties in the evenings night time when I would drink. A nice happy moment I felt recently was realizing that I started to develop real hobbies and not just things that I thought I should do so Im not just drinking. I realized that while I was drinking the only reason I had hobbies was to justify my drinking later on. Now when I do something like exercise I feel the true benefits. Not just the feeling I used to give myself in the past. I used to tell myself something along the lines of well now I can drink later on and not feel bad about it. So basically to sum it up hobbies and occupying my time learning things has given me true joy. Something worth mentioning The true joy I felt wasnt always starting a hobby for the first time. It was doing it on a consistent basis and watching it grow and develop. ,stopdrinking,dctgq7e,4,t5_2s7yr

I started pinching the shit out of myself anytime I started thinking about it. Some times I pinch myself  times in an hour others days just when I drive buy a place I bought alcohol.  I started hitting the gym really hard.  The times I would normally start to drink I went to gym. Ive never seen alcohol in a gym. Most people there are looking for personal self improvement just like me. Eventually their motivation started wearing off on me! Give yourself goals other than Im not drinking alcohol. If my only goal was to not drink alcohol. what do you think I would think about? The farther away from my thoughts the easier it was. By no means Im I a success story in this realm if I wore I wouldnt be here. I hope it helps even if its just a little. ,stopdrinking,dctn4s1,2,t5_2s7yr

Either youve been sober for two months or you havent.

I was very comfortable and happy with not being a potsmoker but in this new phase of life began to wonder if I didnt smoke because I didnt like it or because I was afraid of it. I dont want fear to dictate my life.So I got high got nauseous and realized Yup! Not my drug not for me and havent touched it since.

Im a bit of a serial entrepreneur too... so I get inspired and go flat out on something when it happens but when its not Im simply waiting.  Waiting for the inspiration to strike again. I think its just me to a large degree.  bipolar perhaps? heh  But the sobriety isnt giving me the kick I used to feel from making a comeback.  I think I used to get some real drive when I came back from a binge.  The underdog!  The phoenix back from the flames... from the edge of hell!  It was probably all my head though lol. Ive been rejecting social stuff lately.  Just cant be fucked.  Seems like such a waste of time and effort for the reward.  Just seems so showy.  I dont think I get a deep enough connection with people any more.  Maybe I used to feel closer to my drinking buddies because we were all drunk and on the same wavelength?

10750087,0,t3_5tqw11,I can relate. My husband isnt an alcoholic I know I know but just hear me out. He only drinks about  beers per night a bit more when his brother is over and Ive rarely if ever seen him drunk.The thing is for me its not even the drinking  its what were not doing instead. If you have even a few beers thats your night ya know? You plop down at the computer have some beers get up to pee play a game and thats it. Since Ive not drank at all Ive been walking when we get a niceweather evening calling friends writing letters cooking better lifting weights in our makeshift weight room. Yet when I was having even a glass of wine per night that was the activity.For me I realized that asking him to stop or nagging would NOT work. His brothers SO does that and it just depresses and infantilizes the guy. I had to lead by example and he caught on. He saw how much more energy I have and on his own over time cut way way down. I dont expect that hell be a teetotaler like me which is fine for a nonaddict but to not drink every single day was huge! Oddly we went through this with pot too. I dont drink at all but will still partake in the devils lettuce about twice per month  and it makes those times so much more fun and a treat and doesnt make me a navelgazer in the evenings. ,stopdrinking,ddosf3g,5,t5_2s7yr

10754863,0,t1_ddp9jtz,Sure. Heres my non neuroscientist understanding of it.Theyve proven a relationship between addictive behaviors and activity in certain areas of the brain. Proven at least for someone like me maybe not for the FDA.The short explanation is they hook your brain up to a computer and train it to produce more brain waves of a certain type and less of another type.My treatment started with a QEEG brain map. They ran my brain map through  databases comparing it to other  year old right handed males... Turns out my brain produces no alpha waves which govern relaxation and way too many beta waves logic reason stress anxiety.Treatment has consisted of the doc hooking up three electrodes to my head two on my ears and one on my scalp. Then she puts settings on this program. Theres a green pixelated guy on the screen and a marimba sound. When my brain produces the right amount of alpha waves and beta waves the guy runs and a marimba sound plays. When it doesnt the guy stops running.Apparently this is operant conditioning training my brain to behave in a certain way without my input. My experience has been that after every session I feel extremely relaxed in a way that previously I was only able to achieve while drunk or on drugs. Also these sessions have been insanely effective in stopping cravingsHeres some more reading if youre interestedP.S.

10765691,0,t1_ddqc9ju,Take a look at this map of the Tentacles of Big Bev That Envelope the Globe .  Reminds me of the Mafia Maps that the Feds used to put on the wall a la Sopranos.  Again the Mafia is bush league compared to these guys.  Its amazing to think that there are only  major entities in the Big Bev family.  Theyve carved up the globe.  Just like the mafia.  Except theyre legal.  The Largest liquor and beer distributor in my state is owned by one family. The patriarch doesnt drink and wont allow any of his family to do so. Hes worth about  million according to public records.What does he know that he doesnt want others to know?Simple alcohol is a chemical compound that at turns is a disinfectant a solvent a mild cleaning agent a carcinogen fuel and a poison.Yet weve been sold a bill of goods that life is better with alcohol!Prohibition was the Best thing that ever happened to Big Bev.  We are convinced that it should be legal.  Now Im actually not disputing that principle..I believe adults should have every right to do whatever they want with their body as long as theyre not interfering with the rights of someone else.  The problem is that one persons alcohol consumption in all too many instances does affect the rights and quality of life of others.  Spouses children innocent bystanders and drivers.. Ill never be as large or powerful by myself as Big Bev. I dont have the answers.  I may not even be sure what The Question is.  I know that alcohol could have easily ruined my life.  Alcohol has a plan  destroy my relationships ruin my life and kill me.  Sometimes the order gets mixed up.   Big Bev directly contributed to my brothers suicide  months ago.  All I know that I can do is remain unimpaired.  Help and support others.  Let my choices actions behaviors along with Kindness and Compassion for others speak for me.

I grew up with a family system that supported and even encouraged heavy drinking. I grew disgusted with my fathers habits quickly and vowed to myself to never end up like that. Unfortunately I normalized my own binge drinking habits at an early age and am now in utter disbelief over the depth of my problem and the intensity of my mistake DUI. I am so fortunate that no one died or was seriously injured including myself. Now with  days sober Im taking the necessary steps through AA individual therapy and meditation to address my issue.

10781365,0,t3_5u7tjp, months ago I woke up in the same condition. My liver was hurting really bad I was pale super bloated wasnt eating... I felt like I was seriously about to go to sleep one night and not wake up. Terrible sleeping habits crazy dreams suicidal thoughts...etc. I was drinking at least a pint of vodka a night but it was usually accompanied by  oz beers. This didnt even get me drink just maintained my sanity.  I got fired from my jobs for calling in sick a million times. I finally called my family and told them my condition. I moved back into my parents house and Ive been off and on sober for  months. Ive slipped a couple times. For me I had to make a drastic change to actually change my habits. I wasnt able to do it on my own lord knows I tried for  years straight utterly failing. I have my family breathalyze me every night so I can have accountability. Im trying to go super hard core with my sobriety. The beast inside me that likes drinking is a super gnarly cunning smart tricky bastard. Smarter than me. The only way I can beat him down is with equal amounts of trickery which is just accountability. I think the hardest part for me is the sobering up part. I hate fucking hate detoxing. Once I get sober its a lot easier to stay sober. But just getting to a zero BAC level is scary as hell. A couple times I went to the ER and told them things got very bad when I detox. They put me in an official detox unit with Librium iv fluids and safe place without alcohol. It was almost like a little retreat. But then once I felt really good super hydrated full and sober id think...damn I feel great... I should get a drink. ,stopdrinking,dds0pi2,1,t5_2s7yr

10801486,0,t3_5uhfww,Im glad you got rid of it. When I first stopped drinking hadnt committed to stopping forever obviously one day I thought to myself you know what? Im going to go buy a box of wine to have around the house for the occasional glass. It sat there unopened for weeks and I felt so smug knowing that I wasnt drinking it. I thought I was in control of myself. Then one day I had some. It was a Sunday afternoon I was bored. Nothing else to blame it on. Following that glass I drank the entire rest of the day into Monday morning and it precipitated an absolutely demoralizing relapse. Nowadays over  days later I dont mind when my roommate has some in the house but I consciously avoid even looking at it. It might sound ridiculous but it makes me feel safer and I dont want to let my guard down. Alcohol is sneaky AF and I learned my lesson the hard way.

10823921,0,t3_5un4jf,gtMy problem is my problem and isnt bound by a disease or ism.Interesting choice of words.  What then is it bounded by?  Is it boundless?  The label on the problem isnt what is important it is the scope of the problem that is the important thing to understand.  If you have your problem beat then congratulations to you! Seriously.  Personally I gave up on the idea of moderation the day I started being truly honest with myself about my problem.  Before that day I would entertain the thought that I had a problem but I would quickly dismiss it. Because after all I wasnt addicted I was just choosing to drink.  If I ever started to have a problem then I would stop because I wouldnt want to be an alcoholic. Alcoholics get DUIs.  Alcoholics drink at work. Alcoholics lose their families.  Alcoholics cant go a day without alcohol.  Alcoholics have liver disease...  I didnt have any of those problems so therefore I was not an alcoholic.  Case closed.  I was able to tell that lie to myself for a long time.  One day I was taking a break from drinking I could do that because I was definitely for sure  not an alcoholic and I came across this subreddit and this post and it change my thinking on the subject.  gtAn alcoholic is characterized by how they react to alcohol not by the type of bag around their bottles or their tendency to embark on movieclichedrunk behavior or the amount of cars theyve wrecked or marriages theyve ruined or jobs theyve lost or nights spent in jail or on a park bench or amount they drink or the amount of time theyve been drinking or anything else like that.I encourage you to read the whole post.  So I just wrote all this out and then I read your post that ubobaduk linked togt As long as I continue to take my meds get to meetings and keep myself in a healthy environment I know Im going to be ok.

10852492,0,t3_5v5gyx,I dont go to AA.  I looked into SMART Recovery and found it interesting more appealing to me but I dont really use it.  It might be worth looking at the tools they offer and they have online meetings too which can be more convenient for some people.I dont think AA is bullshit it just isnt quite right for me or you from the sound of it. Thats fine but I wouldnt call it bullshit just because it isnt for me.  I know it is a great help to other people so for that reason I am glad it exists.I am not exactly long term compared to others but I have found that this forum has been a great help.  I check in every day and read a lot of the posts for insight inspiration and support.I also found that I had to address the reasons for my drinking and other destructive behaviours so I have found counselling journaling mindfulness and reflection to be really key factors in keeping me on track.I understand that the rule of not posting while not sober might sound odd but I would hate to come on here drunk and say some of the rubbish that I tend to say when Im drunk. I guess it can also be upsetting to other people.  And I know that for me I simply dont have the presence of mind to offer or accept support when Im drunk.I hope you find what youre looking for there are a lot of resources and support mechanisms out there I am sure there will be something you find helpful if not now then when youre ready.,stopdrinking,ddzcvyr,1,t5_2s7yr

10923514,0,t3_5w1ps6,The thing is that although you cant go back and just live your life without booze you can move forward and live your life without booze. Who cares about going back? Its the future that is important. The future is the only place I can be different. Its the only place where I can work towards becoming the person I want to be. I would caution you against believing that what you see on facebook represents reality. What you see is only what people want others to see. Its not an accurate representation of anyones life. I believe that I can have a good and healthy life if I stay sober and take care of myself. I believe you can too and that the fact that we have this opportunity is beautiful in and of itself. ,stopdrinking,de6oncp,3,t5_2s7yr

10929445,0,t3_5w4gt2,Responsible gun owners who feel themselves becoming psychologically unhinged selfharming etc. will often give their guns to another responsible gunowning friend. In fact thats usually what is encouraged by psychologists treating people like veterans etc.Pouring it all down the drain like others are suggesting might be cathartic but if you know some lucky soul who can actually moderate their intake maybe you should give it to them. Like a suicidal gun owner giving their firearms to a trusted friend theres something to be said about a gesture that says heres a burden I cant handle that will ultimately harm or kill me but I know you can responsibly enjoy it.

Really is not a onesizefitsall solution.  Ive achieved mine through checkins on this board  the book This Naked Mind.  The book helped me immensely to understand the physical and psychological effects alcohol has on your body and mind. Viewing alcohol as the poison that is is has really helped to change my viewpoint and I dont have the cravings for it anymore.

10959797,0,t1_dea87l3,thats not really the full disclosure on antabuse. it takes time for the effectiveness of the drug to disappear. e.g. once you have a decent amount in your system say have been taking it daily for  week it can be up to  days after stopping taking antabuse before you can drink without an interaction.thats the whole point of the drug. you cant stop one day to drink the next day without a nasty interaction. it completely takes opportunistic drinking off the table. you have to REALLY plan your relapse  like a week in advance.i found antabuse useful in establishing a pattern of sobriety early on in stopping drinking. also if you stay on it it removes that oh ill just have one opportunity that trips people up later down the line.,stopdrinking,deafbsq,3,t5_2s7yr

At first blush that seems like a rational philosophy based upon the fact of ones mortality  but if I take a moment and think about what is factually very very likely to occur in my life based on statistical probabilities then its quickly apparent its  actually not a sound conclusion at all. In fact its a terrible proposition because the reality is I am very very very likely to NOT die suddenly tomorrow so living as if it it has a good chance of it happening is irrational. It is actually a terrible terrible bet.  Profoundly bad odds of a good payoff as the future which Im sacrificing for a momentary sensation is almost certainly  going to become a reality for me.  Taking it even further does it not seem just idiotic to hope for an unexpected demise in the near future just to justify bad decisions in the moment??? Like how does that make sense?

11049854,0,t3_5xs1yg,Zipster man I feel for you. Ive been there...TOO. many. times.I remember feeling like a wild horse and I was not going to be subjugated by anybody or anything. Well that was my selfwill run riot. I wanted to be done but I would think Well how done do I want to be?! Not enough at the time apparently. Not enough to just stop. Ill say this though I wasnt thinking those thoughts when I finally did stop.I remember looking at the calendar and wondering when I was going to stop. I was like that out of body thing you mentioned where I felt I had zero control like I was watching a movie and I had no idea how long it would be or what the outcome would be. I had become friends with a well known Hollywood actress who was sober and she kept calling me trying to get me to come back to the doctors office she was dating the doctor but I wouldnt even pick up the phone and this was one of my favorite actresses from when I was a teenager!. That was pretty surreal. Fast forward to today and somehow I got sober and stayed sober but she overdosed and died. The tables can turn completely the other way around with this seemingly interminable disease.Im reminded of a joke that I vaguely remember about accepting help former Catholic here and I heard it in church or catechism as a kid. Theres a bad flood and a religious guy is stuck at his house. The police come by in a x to get him but he says No God will save me. Some time passes and the roads can no longer be navigated due to the rising waters but a rescue team comes by in a boat to save the guy but he says No God will save me. More time passes and now the water is so high the guy is standing on top of his roof. A rescue team in a helicopter flies in to save the guy but he says No God will save me. Eventually the guy drowns. Suddenly he is going through the pearly gates of heaven where he sees God and says God why didnt you save me? God says Are you kidding me? I sent a car a boat and a helicopter and you turned them all down! I had a hard time accepting help even asking for it. At least you are asking for help. I dont know how to tell you to stop because I didnt know how to stop either. I just did I know crappy answer but Ive never heard a better one that didnt involve men in white outfits or the police. People kept throwing ropes down into the well and I finally grabbed one and held on. Stopping wasnt really my problem. It was staying stopped! After  rehabs numerous relapses including almost having a year  times I finally got into and committed myself to a program of recovery did all the work on myself as directed and I almost hate to admit this it stuck. My daily reprieve is contingent on my continuing the treatments. This is much much easier to maintain than to try get out of that well again. I hope youre able to find what I found. Theres no need to suffer. Better days were ahead for me when I finally started believing it to be so but I had to believe it first.,stopdrinking,dekhcw2,1,t5_2s7yr

11062942,0,t3_5xxmpp,I largely ignored the statistics I viewed it as withing my control to choose to remain sober. When I quit something I read showed me that the probability of relapse lowers with increased length of sobriety and I just set about putting as much distance between me and alcohol as possible.Indeed when I first started I was in two minds about whether I would drink again one day so I parked the question still focusing on reminaing sober. After four months sober something clicked for me and I accepted deepdown that sober is the best way for me to stay. From that point onward my focus has been on living and enjoying my sober life with a good balance of things in it I consider my risk of relapse to be low I do remain vigilant. My thinking has flipped on its head alcohol is no longer my safety blanket or reward alcohol is my poison and my prison. It is through sobriety that I get freedom to live my life and focus on the things that truly matter to me.,stopdrinking,delysqr,2,t5_2s7yr

11162304,0,t3_5zd3cm,Well you can if you want to?  Alcohol made it easier for me to do things I didnt want to do.  And that could mean hanging around with people andor certain people.  Its been hard to honor the voice inside my head telling me what it actually wants because sometimes it would tell me to do things that I didnt want to admit to myself I wanted.Like do jigsaw puzzles drinkingme you cant possibly spend hours doing that what a waste of time or do good job at work drinkingme work is such a chore and bore and so beneath you i mean dont get fired but fuck em right?.  Sometimes socialize with others is one of those things too.  Maybe it is for you too?  Like... I dunno maybe if you feel like you dont have fun with friends..dont be with them? maybe you need newdifferent friends?  But maybe if thats just an excuse to drink more alone when youre bored i did that lots! then its a bad idea?But also it doesnt have to be eitheror.  If your mind is telling you the only possible choices are see friends and drink or never see people again perhaps theres a bit more gray area than your brain wants to let on.  Certainly if i thought I could never see people again and the only alternative was to drink because I had to to be around people.. well then drinking is clearly the only logical choice right?  Maybe Im wrong.. I dunno exactly what your brain is telling you.  But I know my brain brought forward so many false equivalences whatever it took to convince me to have one because after that it was easier to have two because alcohol made it easier for me to do the things I didnt want to do like drink until I was passout drunkHang in there.

11186692,0,t3_5zpmkf,Your confusing addiction with physical dependence addiction is alcoholism IMO alcohol is just a drug. A legal drug that has worked its way to the center of our culture. We cant ban it tried because literally anyone can make a bunch of it. So its legal still a drug it doesnt work by magic and its activities in the brain are similar to other drugs. Addiction is a state of being characterized by dysfunctional use of substances it could be one substance e.g. Alcohol or cocaine or several. If a person abuses the crap out of one substance they will not be able to have just one that is because the pathway has been sensitized and desensitized in its respective areas to have a blunted response to the dopamine response or other response e.g. Sedation while at the same time being activated heavily.In nature addiction I suspect addiction was an asset with behaviors like food finding shelter getting and sex making giving rise to long lasting delta fos b proteins which act on genes to regulate cell growth in the reward system of the brain. It acts like fertilizer for neurons in the nucleous accombans this increases the amount of substrate for thought transmission and thereby the intensity by which someone will think about and Pursue attempting to delete the behavior However in the modern world comforts are thrown at us left and right we are only limited in our access to them by the amount of money we are willing to spend. SO this obviously is a problem and its easy to loose control if you have the mutation in the genes of the d? Or d idrreceptor typeAlcoholism is just addiction to a common drug called alcohol it is not a unique addiction other than the social context e.g. Going to bars ect Sorry for the lengthy isnt but its an important concept I believe to understand since advantages can be had both to the lay person and to the scientific community by taking an appropriate view of this neurological disorder ,stopdrinking,dezzyc9,7,t5_2s7yr

For what its worth I remember hearing one of the rehab workers saying that around two weeks is when something happens and addicts start dealing with their issues. About  to  percent relapse the year after rehab so you would need to be prepared for that. From my perspective which is all I can really give I felt great betrayal initially that the marriage was over but being on my own allowed me to absolutely control my recovery. If you are determined that the relationship is over then it might be worth telling him in rehab where he can get appropriate support. If you end the relationship shortly into recovery from the family home then all sorts of complications can ensue the most likely being he will relapse and try and blame you writing from my own  experience again there.

11222757,0,t1_df42p2w,I felt the same way too. I never really drank much during the day but the ongoing tiredness from drinking at night meant that I wasnt really being the best parent I could be. I feel like Ive found so much more time to get things done now too.Ive been reading about addiction lately and one thing I read really struck me.... that relapse can often be predicted by a change in thought pattern. This is exactly what happened to me last year when I had two months off. I went from thinking Im never drinking again to Im sure I can have one or two and moderate my drinking. So I had one at my brothers in laws th birthday  and it was downhill from there. Straight back into what Id worked so hard to get out of.Im sort of observing my own thinking now. If those thoughts start to creep in my logical brain is telling them to  get out. I know that I cant moderate my drinking. Its all or nothing.Youre nearly at  days.... hang in there!!

I convinced myself it would help me shake off the chills and cut down my booze budget as I usually drink  packs at double the price. I take the bus from the city to my suburb  slamming the vodka in no more than  minutes. Its an additional half hour walk home with two bars on the way. Feeling my buzz taper I walked to the nearest bar for just a cold one to stay toasty for the walk. Well I remember the first beer and after that the memories come and go but what I remember was meeting some creep I would otherwise never talk to being at a strip club with said creep also something I would never do throwing s at strippers being physically thrown out of creeps truck knocking on random doors in a wealthy neighborhood I had no knowledge of cops handcuffs home miraculously they just drove me home.

11270341,0,t1_df82iet,Well. . . Im not sure why Im arguing about this. Lets not. I guess my response would be alcohol is actually restricted more than tobacco.

11273044,0,t3_60qtz5,In order for your body to process alcohol it converts it into an aldehyde. The build up of aldehyde in your system causes the drinker to have a ruddy complexion which goes away when the aldehyde is broken down into carboxylic acid and even ketones. Chronic drinkers can contain a level of aldehyde in their system leaving them with a ruddy complexion all the time. That makes me want to quit as my face is red all the time... not a good look obviously. But congratulations on your success we endure changes gradually and sometimes cannot chart the change mentally. But this is astounding your transformation. Congratulations to you! I wish you luck on your journey.Fun fact this is why Asian populations become very red when they drink as they possess a defective gene that doesnt allow for them to produce the enzyme used break down aldehyde as quickly.,stopdrinking,df9s79a,1,t5_2s7yr

11295976,0,t3_617rns,My alcohol consumption level was very similar to yours when I decided to stop although probably over a much longer duration given that I am  and also never felt no more than a gentle force of habit to resist popping open an IPA during my first few days of sobriety. So yes when comparing myself to some of the more extreme rock bottom and withdrawal accounts I too wondered whether alcoholic was an appropriate descriptor.As time has passed however its becoming evident that I am simply a far more effective and decent person without alcohol than I was with it. So much so that putting some arbitrary label on whatever I am wouldnt be helpful or relevant to me. Its good enough for me to know that today I am FAR closer to being the best version of myself than I was just four months ago.So congrats on your two months sober and no need to worry about coming across as a braggart!,stopdrinking,dfcdrx3,2,t5_2s7yr

11340012,0,t1_df7etho,This is pretty much how I feel except that I think my weed consumption may be a bit higher than yours LOL.  Alcohol is the thing that was ruining my life health and selfworth. Really hurting me and keeping me in a hurt place. A lot of emotional processing is going on now that I am away from it  a lot of scary old pain that I was too afraid to befriend in my alcoholweakened state I now have the strength and attention and compassion to be able to let that old pain through instead of keeping it trapped inside. Weed if anything is helping facilitate that process at this point. My highest priority is staying away from alcohol for good for this initial phase weed is one of the things that is helping me do that along with fizzy water kombucha exercise meditationhypnotherapy ice cream and bunches of other selfcare stuff. I too consider myself sober though this may not meet other peoples definitions of it. I like your thought about getting to define ones own sobriety.

Im taking that as a win and keeping my fingers crossed  Struggle Twice now my husband has made comments along the lines of my not drinking is because he wont let me. When he said it this weekend I think it pushed me closer to drinking than I have been in months just to prove how much control he has over me. I told him not to say that ever again and he responded that it was just a joke. Ive been stewing on it non stop now just the thought of it makes me so mad.

11422180,0,t1_dfponso,Im cognitively coherent enough to process more emotions and situations. I lived in a bubble before a smoke filled alcohol bubble that made me not want to address anything I mightve found difficult. I think Ive mostly always been self aware of the issues I had but never did anything to change them. Would blame external powers outside my control for keeping me down. Now its a whole lot easier Im clear headed and can now make a goal for myself and actually accomplish it. However Im not even close to where I want to be in life right now but am stepping in the right direction at least instead of falling backwards on my ass cause of the huge load I was carrying. I hate the term dry drunk. You can be sober and be stressed and have issues its okay to be irritated from time to time like anyone else. Negative emotion is important to experience and process constructively. Its being human. One of my favorite quotes is Trust those who seek the truth but doubt those who say theyve found it.,stopdrinking,dfqoxxu,1,t5_2s7yr

Push it out of your mind. Think of anything else. Think of something else that you would REALLY like to do at home. Forget about the alcohol. When you drive home just completely forget about it.

I guess I just got really discouraged because Ive been reading a lot of posts about people not being able to quit without completely cutting out all places with alcohol and people that drink. But youre right his drinking should absolutely not have any bearing on my sobriety. It just gets hard sometimes watching him game and get drunk and having fun. It looks so appealing but I cant remember a time I drank and had fun. The night always ends with fights and the mornings with with emotional and physical pain.

Maybe pick up a hobby or take a bath instead of a shower. Just random thoughts. You clearly know you ARE worth it if you werent you would have given up on yourself and your commitment to stay sober.

11599567,0,t3_65h4ir,I LOVE this meme.  Yes passionate Atheist here however am a fan of the goodness from all philosophical leanings.  The whole concept of recognize repent forgiveness and redemption are real and visceral to me as through a long patch of sobriety I saw the important of recognizing my problem repenting or ceasing the behavior which is more than just quitting.  Its working the twelve steps or self directed processes that heal the reasons we feel alcohol must be assimilated in order to enjoy or abide our daily walk then seeing the forgiveness that is freely given whether we ask for it or in my experience just flowed to me like a torrent as I quietly resurrected from my droopy eyes and mouth bad skin and bad behavior and became the Father Husband friend exercise partner work colleague that I had been I can be good at all of these when alcohol is absent in my life before I came to suffer under the lash of the first drink.  Payoff is when I receive a call from a fellow sojourner who seeks help or when I am present with a son working on homework or walking away from the job knowing that I did a great job.  Some of the best payoff has come when Im on the ridge line of Sardine  above the canyon and lake far below with the salmon light intensifying in the east stopping and drinking in the fresh air fresh lungs and hungover free existence.  I point my bike back to the trail where Ive got  minutes of single track descent through the fruity pebble colored oak and maple with the only sound being the wind over my helmet straps.  I had dinner with my wife the other night.  The smells were incredible.  My sinuses are clearing my chest is shrinking my chest is swollen when Im binging and I was present and focused on her.  She laughs I laugh and its genuine.  Through those connective glances her love comes eagerly although gaurdedly I will work to get it back. Theres redemption in daily sobriety but as a relapser I have to remember the benefit to be had in long sobriety.  I had  years once but have been struggling for a few years.  I understand that being a serial relapser that the most important thing is to get back on track however I cant forget that for redemption and long term trust to be reestablished a long term of continuous sobriety is required.  Meditation.  Learning.  Exercise.  Philosophy.  Music.  Art.  These are all higher powers.  This forum is a higher power.  Thanks for this thread.  ,stopdrinking,dgatikg,2,t5_2s7yr

I was  still am craving sweets too regularly. In my case theres overexhaustion amp anxiety plus depression too though involved. I think of it as listening to myself if Im feeling sleepy I probably need the restand the sugar cravings are very common for people whove drank frequently a lot for a long time and then stop. Something to do with dopamine and the reward center in the brain. ,stopdrinking,dgp8l29,2,t5_2s7yr

11735850,0,t1_dgqa755,I wanted to add that it is an amazing feeling to feel FREE.  Truly free of that obsession with drinking the jealousy of watching others be able to enjoy it responsibly the bargaining with oneself over moderating.  It happened for me when I decided I was someone who didnt want to drink not someone who COULDNT drink.  The difference is that one feels like a positive choice and the other feels like a punishment you can rebel against.  Theres nothing to rebel against if its what you really want and then the freedom and growth begins.  Longwinded sorry.  But as a former tequila and beer aficionado I am still blown away by how wonderful it feels to be free from booze!,stopdrinking,dgqadz2,2,t5_2s7yr
11736099,0,t3_67gex2,Wonderful first step!For me one of the hardest parts was admitting that I had a problem.  And by extension most of my family many of my friends and my native culture had a problem.  That was a difficult lesson very alienating. At the same time we also feel alienated through hiding the extent of our drinking and its problems.Fortunately here you can find a new culture new friends and a new direction.  I am so very very glad to be moving in a new direction it is worth Every Effort I made.,stopdrinking,dgqbej6,1,t5_2s7yr
11740566,0,t3_67j40x,To start off with I tried to be relaxed with using a splash of wine in cooking. Whist it didnt trigger me it did interfere with my peace of mind as I was having to keep checking on myself. So partly for my own peace of mind and partly because I can I have drawn a hard line on things containing alcohol. ,stopdrinking,dgqtn0z,2,t5_2s7yr

11745793,0,t3_67knkm,Awesome job man!! I was sober for  months before this. My last trip into the liquor store was that exact voice in my head. Fuck it  lets do this! Then I broke down and gave into another week long bender. Today I walked to the store to buy groceries around am. Right next to the king soopers is a liquor store open at the same time. I saw  people waiting outside the liquor store waiting to get in and even remember myself doing the same thing awhile ago. None of those  people looked healthy by any means. Your description of zombies unable to control their own actions definitely hits the nail on the head. Our bodies trick us into thinking we need this poison to keep going.  shudder It pains me to think how dependent I was.  This is a great perspective to have and I will not drink with you today!!!!!!!,stopdrinking,dgreymh,2,t5_2s7yr

Like you my mind runs away with itself too and drinking would make that worse I would be paranoid I had said the wrong thing or my message interprated wrong ugh! Hope she has the heart to message you back good or bad.At least it proves you are much stronger than you were this wont be a reason to fall back to drinkyou are so much better than that.Chin up my friend. ,stopdrinking,dgtzvjx,3,t5_2s7yr

11786528,0,t3_685txm,One thing that works for me is not dealing in absolutes. I dont tell myself  Im never drinking again! That never works because psychologically its tempting. I tell myself Im taking a break. Now  I have no intention of drinking in the future but it takes the pressure off rather than worrying about an absolute decree. I know its just my weird justification but it helps me. Sometimes youve got to fool your own brain. Thats what Ive learned but Im bipolar too so ya...,stopdrinking,dgw1j0x,3,t5_2s7yr
