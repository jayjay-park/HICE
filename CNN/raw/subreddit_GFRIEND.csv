5677901,0,t1_cx0q49v,hahaha Falling in Love... I like that. Yerin fell at a recent performance also but laughed it off and got up quickly with nothing more than scratch on her knee. Momma Sowon took care of her quickly. Baes is my new favorite though. Keeps that relationship aspect and its lighthearted. ,GFRIEND,cx0webx,2,t5_35ul7

10881088,0,t1_de2ax81,I actually wish Yerins hair was either a shade lighter or a shade darker and that Sowon had chunky red highlights instead of an overall tint but Im just really glad they didnt change Eunhas hair...it really frames her face so well and shows off her bone structure.,GFRIEND,de2b24q,4,t5_35ul7

11428648,0,t1_dfrebzu,rthebluecorner is actively keeping that part blue. Its best to look for noiserandomness when trying to find a spot but basically all space has been accounted for by now... I think within the kpop neighborhood if we take the part southeast of Seolhyuns heart and perhaps cut into Megamans beam wed have enough space to work with.,GFRIEND,dfrfbfv,2,t5_35ul7
