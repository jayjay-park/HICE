11056065,0,t1_del5o2e,Week B refers to the second games of Week  in other words Thursday.  It doesnt refer to the B team games of Week .  Theres already a A reaction thread which is where youd want to comment on both A and B team games for last night.,NFTL,del6q1x,3,t5_3ggxn

11105601,0,t3_5yjt8i,I am SO PROUD of my team right now. st place in the division for both A and B. Both teams have a first round bye. Both teams have multiple players in the top  and  for an array of stats. Our depth is incredible. I honestly feel bad for guys on my team because we legitimately could field  sets of highly competitive A and B teams. Its unfair certain players are on B or even rotational B when they could be rotating on A or starting B on almost any other team.I was nervous after the draft as to how things would turn out since my draft approach was pretty experimental. Talk about a risk worth taking though. Hopefully everyone who didnt want me todidnt think I could be a captain is rethinking that now. Shout out to ROFL for the hours he put in with me fine tuning my draft plan. Shout out to Intercest for trusting me and agreeing to be my NPC pick I think we can both agree that was a good choice p I hope this was enough to send a message that I can captain NLTP because as a rookie captain I dont know what more I can do to show Im ready. This was not a fluke. This team was built with a specific model in mind we thought would work. Seems like it paid off big time. No reason I cant bring my success to NLTP with my own team.Fucking great job team.,NFTL,deqt6l3,12,t5_3ggxn
