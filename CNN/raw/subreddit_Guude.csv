8842938,0,t1_d7as1pt,I dunno if I can answer this. You know how depending on mood you need a certain song to help or hurt you through it? I will say Pearl Jam will probably always be my top band but Counting Crows or OAR or Eric Hutchinson come I there too. Music is too diverse to pick any one song.,Guude,d7asnjh,10,t5_2y7lw
