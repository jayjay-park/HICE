3286118,0,t3_2xs23p,The VAs Public Affairs Officer Jim Gleisberg says its unlikely for what the veteran said happened to have happened and added Its very hard to communicate even though we think we communicate well sometimes we just dont communicate well.This Veteran would add Sometimes VA doesntwont communicate AT ALL or it misrepresents the record and when that happens not even your Senators inquiries can get VA to acknowledge its own records.,VeteransBenefits,cp2udof,1,t5_2vlaz
3286801,0,t3_2xpbi8,It is not unusual for future exams to be scheduled once a rating is granted. This is especially so for recently separated veterans claims and for younger veterans. This is done because there is the possibility the condition may improve to a point that a rating should based on the rating schedule be reduced to the next lower or other lower level. This is also done when a condition is in a recuperative state. It used to be that future exams were schedule approximately every two years until it was determined that the condition was static or would not get any better. That time period was recently expanded to three years. You do not have to be declared both total and permanent to have no further exams scheduled but you do need to be considered permanent at the rating you were assigned. Every rating decision comes with a code sheet. Unfortunately the code sheet is not normally included with the rating decision sent to the claimant. The code sheet is very important. Every condition is assigned a  digit code that can be researched in the rating schedule to determine the following was the rating code assigned the correct code was the percentage assigned correct based on symptoms recorded and were some of the symptoms recorded included in the next higher rating? These are all facts that are subject to be appealed.Also on the code sheet there are some boxes with various information. One box should indicate something like future exam scheduled or no future exams. No future exams is an indication that a future exam will not be routinely scheduled. This is no guarantee an exam will not be scheduled but for the most part it will not be routinely scheduled.We learn to live with our disabilities. VA medical appointments are scheduled during normal business hours so those appointments can interfere with employment. We tend to protect out employment either by saying we dont need further care or in some cases not keeping a routine appointment thereby not being scheduled for further medical appointments. The disadvantage of not keeping routine appointments for ongoing health care is an absence of a record of symptoms. When a new C amp P exam is scheduled the examiners and the ratings specialists are supposed to look at the entire picture  current symptoms the day of the exam and the record of symptoms between the last C amp P exam and the current one. The absence of symptoms is viewed as an improvement in the condition and may result in a proposed reduction of the current rating. Any time a rating decision is issued veterans should request a copy of the code sheet to that rating decision if it is not  and it usually is not  included with the rating decision. The information on that sheet is very important.,VeteransBenefits,cp2x6mr,2,t5_2vlaz
11099240,0,t1_demp1m5,I certainly hope so.  I gave them a call sometime earlier this week and asked for a ballpark estimate on how long it takes.  The lady stated and with understandable condensation taht since I barely submitted my last test it was better to call back in a couple of weeks to find a more definitive answer.  Its going to take a while I understand that.  Hell Im keeping busy looking for another job at the moment I just dont see myself living off of what I get IF I get anything from them.  But in the back of my mind I remember reading horror stories of what some Vietnam and ODS veterans have had to put up with.  I guess I just dont want to be in that same boat.In any case thanks for the reply.  Any information is helpful.  And wish everyone nothing but the best.,VeteransBenefits,deq3836,1,t5_2vlaz
