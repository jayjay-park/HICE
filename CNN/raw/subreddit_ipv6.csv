Do NOT try to further subnet a   it will break lots of stuff. If you really need another subnet you can a try to NAT it which is ugly and I hate it or b ask for another  from your ISP.

2913941,0,t1_cnv4nnr,There are other sites that do this too. You can often tell because they will hang while loading over HTTP and will not respond to an ICMP Ping. www.nuevasync.com is another example. To fix this one thing you can do is set the IPv MTU on your network. Often your router already knows it and doesnt have these issues. My problem was that the router wasnt advertising it to the LAN.,ipv6,cnzbmnn,1,t5_2qmpw

3787609,0,t3_33pwhc,Id guess its a few things happening at once... Statistical bias.  Devices with IPv support enabled are more likely to be newer and faster On mobile G phones with newer firmware vs older G phones.  For hardwired areas with IPv have likely had recent infrastructure upgrades while areas without IPv are probably still running older hardware.  . Lack of nonsense.  No CarrierGrade NAT on mobile links especially Verizon in USA which could slow things down if the CGN servers are overloaded.. Different routes.  An IPv route to Facebook may take a different path than an IPv route using less congested links,ipv6,cqo0n5l,7,t5_2qmpw

6511624,0,t1_czstqmn,We do this occasionally at the Enterprise level when we cant pin down something to one or more IP addresses.  It is Plan B.  Your firewall has to support the feature though.,ipv6,czsuoy4,4,t5_2qmpw
6528533,0,t1_cztyywv,Sure these things are can be managed but its at a nonzero financial and admin overhead cost and not necessarily scalable.Our transmission team are rehoming exchanges rebalancing backhauls and shuffling things around to be more efficient on almost a daily basis.  Its not really a viable solution to send an email to thousands of residential customers each day.On your second point what happens when you want to increase the pool that youve allocated for one BNG.  You no longer have a contiguous block to increase the subnet size so you add another distinct prefix and fragment your route table Or you could just add a completely new larger subnet let the other one drain and be able to remove it.These things are much easier to manage when youve only got a few thousand customers and a handful of BNGs.Ive been on both sides of the fence and the things Ive done in the past for small ISPs I couldntwouldnt do when Ive got millions of customers the majority of which dont actually care.Once again Im just playing Devils Advocate.  Theres no right or wrong answers here just reasons why an ISP may do one thing or the other.   Also we do do semisticky prefix delegation if the client hasnt sent a RELEASE and youre connecting to the same BNG youll get the same PD.  Its not however sold as a static PD.,ipv6,czuloso,2,t5_2qmpw

10241110,0,t1_dc4u327,Thanks for the reply!. Okay thats pretty much what the IPv NAT holepuncher is currently doing as well so it should be easy to do.. It surely works but I assumed that using the broadcast address is less efficient than having a specific address as even computers not running the game will receive all packets? Why are other applications registering multicast addresses if they could just use ff? Just picking a random unassigned address would work as well I guess the chance of having an address  UDP port collision are low.,ipv6,dc4vxtm,1,t5_2qmpw

11618044,0,t1_dgbpypm,Well that is a good start. Now you just need to router to route you packets. Have you flushed the iptables rules which will leave you with no firewall as a test to make sure the firewall isnt blocking the flow of packets?,ipv6,dgcwz63,1,t5_2qmpw
