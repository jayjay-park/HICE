3346298,0,t3_2y4yuk,The idea from Bogost I connected with was videogames being used to train employees. Regular people wanted to play the game because they thought it was fun but the employees who had to play the game didnt think it was fun they just thought it was a training exercise. Some of my training over the summer was done by playing a videogame. It helped me learn what to do for my job but I wouldnt consider fun nor would I want to play it in my free time.,intromedia,cp9pbwz,1,t5_2zo3f
3354525,0,t3_2ylij7,The controlling idea for my project is that before Bloody Sunday in Selma Alabama  there wasnt much hope for a chance of integration and now with the annual march still happening  years later there is a chance of integration and of everyone coming together as one. I wanted my video to not only show the march but to show the trip to Alabama as well as showing some parts of the town that are much different than what we usually see in here in Michigan. It shows that all races from all over the country and even some different parts of the world are there to support the cause and help the community become a more united place for everyone. ,intromedia,cpan2la,1,t5_2zo3f
