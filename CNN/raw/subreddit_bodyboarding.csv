803688,0,t3_23bxrs,. Lifting or pressing down on the rail that isnt in the water. I have no idea what youre asking. Find the power pocket of the wave can also lift the fin furthest from the wave face out of the water. Depends entirely on the wave like the other dude said this is something that comes naturally with practice.. Teachers and classes are a waste of time unless youre trying to improve your comp surfing in my opinion.. Lol? . Dont really know how to answer this I guess its about reading the wave in front of you and understanding how you need to adjust your line. Youll get it with practice.Like the other dude said youll start out looking and feeling kooky but itll all start to click with practice. Make friends with other lids that helps ,bodyboarding,cgvmsfj,1,t5_2sc1t

5932094,0,t3_3wl66l,These reports are good because the blue will deter tons of people from even paddling out. Friday and Today were awesome IMO and the beaches were dead. Hopefully its the same tomorrow.,bodyboarding,cxx87xq,1,t5_2sc1t

6451931,0,t3_4410ee,Kudos way to look out for your fellow man. I cant tell you how many kids Ive seen swim right by the north side of the pier when we are getting  out of the north. I remember one day the coastguard rescued twentyfive from the water who had been pulled out via rips. They ended up closing the beach. We boarded for four hours no problems but we didnt come with a thousand feet of the pier...,bodyboarding,czmo63f,3,t5_2sc1t

6887076,0,t3_49yh6s,glad you ok uPussayypatrolllUnfortunately or fortunately..depends on how you view it Phillip Island Victoria is home to Australias largest colony of fur seals.. now we do have some big great whites that hang around every now and then...unfortunately I had one cruise past me when it was just me and my mate out.Its quite unsettling having something so big and so powerful just dart past without you even knowing that it was there...also the sheer size of the thing made me realize that Im pretty much powerless if he wanted to grab me..... Sharks are fucking amazing creatures and I love and respect them greatly,bodyboarding,d0wytri,2,t5_2sc1t
6980651,0,t3_4ba5tm,No disrespect taken. Its a nice little wedge that peaks up. It doesnt get much bigger then the  peak it just gets heavier. This picture is on the shoulder where the wave begins to slump off over some boulders.  Its a fun ride people refer to it as the mini pipeline.Thanks for the gath advice. I think its a good idea.,bodyboarding,d17lgb3,2,t5_2sc1t

10164640,0,t3_5linky,At that size its not even worth trying to duck dive you are just tiring yourself out. Ditch the board and sink below the wave.,bodyboarding,dbw7v4g,8,t5_2sc1t

11161844,0,t3_5z9ig4,The hydro tech  fins dont have a ton of power so Im surprised they make you cramp up. Get fins that fit comfortably and then practice with them. Your calves will be the envy of everyone once you have been bodyboarding for a while. I recently got a pair of custom X fins and I am in love. The foot pocket is like memory foam and they fit my feet perfectly. Ive been through  different sets of fins before I found ones I really like.Surfers will usually be faster than you. That said I have a few tips. Push down on the front of your board as you paddle out. This will force your feet deeper into the water and give you more power. Also practice armleg paddling together. Use this when you need maximum speed. Im usually able to keep up with shortboards. Longboarders will just smoke you nothing you can do about it.I dont think your board is too small but going up to a  wouldnt hurt. Im your size but a little heavier and I ride a  Science Style primarily.,bodyboarding,dex6lqe,1,t5_2sc1t
