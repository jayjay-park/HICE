7305259,0,t3_4fange,Hello is an album from of a band with the same name. It was created by Melissa Lefton a semifamous pop star who went bust and made one last ditch effort to get her music out. This effort was the album Hello containing  track  presumed to be songs with lyrics and the other  presumed to just be instrumentals. Although the album came out in  Mellisa had too small of a fan base there was barely any advertisement of the band and they limited sales to their website. Only one of the songs were ever recovered although very little people actually knew it was part of this album. That song was Anything Can Happen which is track  of the album. I through friends of friends of friends was able to track down and record one of the other songs Glowbots Track  and have uploaded it here.The only information we currently have about the album can be found hereHellos Myspace page with  songs that are unplayableA cache of the publishers Frisbie website which apparently had another one of the songs up before it went downQuote from page Hello is an invite into the fantastic dimensions of Misty and Data. A godchild of Eighties New Wave Misty sounds a little like Patti Smith  s teenybopper kid sister treacherously smart yet still up for a lot of fun. She sings about romantic angst flying   glowbots   and of her own soaring ambitions in productions teeming with the same energy as their writing. Clearly Misty and Data love to use pop music to blaze an image into a listener  s mind. Hello recalls classic rock moments on the way to claiming their epic visions. Data plays many instruments finds guest musicians and extends his prodigious gifts for creating from the soundboard. Those two are at the core of Hello out of which delicious hot lava erupts.Discogs page about Hello,Lost_Films,d28k4jy,1,t5_2sqrr
