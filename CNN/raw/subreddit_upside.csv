7586019,0,t3_4j7rfj,Im sorry for your loss OP it sounds like you and your wife are going through a tough stretch. Its hard to look at any part of your situation and find something positive. However it costs a lot of money to support a baby. Your wife just lost her job maybe this wasnt the right time to have a newborn to take care of. Dont ever let your wife think they are related though because they arent. Stay strong.,upside,d34hrsa,2,t5_3e94q
