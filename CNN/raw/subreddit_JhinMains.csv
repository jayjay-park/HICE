6708049,0,t1_d0czm7x,I agree with most of this however i wanna share a few thoughts in addition.Dont duel anyone you cant do it unless you are so far ahead the game is practically already won. Sure you might be able to kill them in  bullets but the time it takes to get  hits out is usually longer than it takes the enemy to kill you.Dont be afraid to attack their tanky frontline you do enough damage that they will feel it let your team worry about their backline. If you get low back off and look for roots with your w or opportunities to target their backline with your ult.During laning phase dont try to force kills. If you see someone is around  hp its tempting to go all in and try to kill them however personally i have a lot more success when i am patient push them out of lane and push the tower. If someone is low you can try to get them lower and then as they are running ult them down. Rarely do i ever commit to a fight in the laning phase and more rarely does it go well your ult is pretty much useless in a close quarters fight so you have a large disadvantage against the enemy adc.Lastly skill order. Maxing Q first is OK if you are having trouble farming which i did at first because of how his ammo works. However i find that maxing W is simply better it allows you to combo much better with your support harass much better and burst people down.,JhinMains,d0d64at,2,t5_3bj08

Instead abuse his passive to execute front line tanks that normally would still have that last  hp etc and try to stick around long enough to clean up with ult. Works very well when playing like an absolute chicken from inside other team members. Also try to avoid kiting away from your own team  he more than any other carry needs the peelcc.

And that the Armor pen build is more suited to people more comfortable with Jhin or experienced while the Crit build is better to people new to Jhin or less experienced. In most situations  of the time Armor pen is the best to go  Crit is the best to go. And yes those builds are what I was speaking of. Im glad that youre taking in the info since youre new to Jhin!

10512222,0,t1_dcyv77p,x lethality runes are better than x ad marks. Basically the  the lethality runes will remove from armor will give you more damage than the x ad marks. It was the same with Crit and Armor pen last year. Armor penLethality is better than extra AD as Jhin. He has high base damage and his abilities benefit a lot more from lethality than AD marks. This is because his abilities have very low AD raitos since he ends up having high AD in the end low AD ratios to keep him balanced . So the extra AD runes wont make any change to your abilities but the lethality runes will. Weather you go Crit or Lethality builds. And his highest damage source for most of the game comes from his abilities. ,JhinMains,dczo7m3,2,t5_3bj08

11525447,0,t3_64gnyc,First off Wow! Welcome to League of Legends mate! Ive spent some  hours on this game since  so it always brings a fond smile to my face when I hear of new people just getting into the game!To start off your build is actually pretty good! Certainly nothing wrong with it if you have fun with it Id suggest sticking with it  Although picking up RFC earlier is pretty important. That item is so nasty on Jhin when you have your th shot ready.As others have pointed out if youre building an Essence Reaver as part of the crit build you should focus on getting value out of its passive Cooldown reduction with Crit chance.So the classic crit build isEssence Reaver gt Zeal gt Ionian Boots gt Rapid Fire Cannon gt Infinity Edge gt Bloodthirster gtArmour Penetration or if they have no tanks Mercurial Scimitar or Phantom Dancer.Let me suggest however a build order Ive had a lot of success with. Both on my main and my goldsilver smurf.Youmuus gt Boots Ionian Swiftness or Ninja Tabis gt Infinity Edge gt RFC gt Situational items. And if the game goes so late youre sitting on heaps of gold I suggest selling the Youmuus for Armour Pen or Lifesteal.Situational items are Armour Pen Mortal Reminder if they have a Vlad or Soraka or Lord Dominiks Regards if they have armour stacking tanks Mercurial Scimitar or Bloodthirster.Youre welcome to check out my builds on op.gg  A great site for checking your match ups or match history.Youll notice I built Mercurial Scimitar religously in those games but thats more of an advanced item. If youd rather not worry about remembering to cleanse Crowd Control with its active but they have a lot of magic damage dealers   Hexdrinker is a great item to buy early and just sit on until late game when you eventually upgrade to Maw of Malmortius.Another good resource for ideas on how to build and what to level on specific champions is champion.gg,JhinMains,dg2etgz,4,t5_3bj08
