7704670,0,t3_4h1ibj,Just finished the manga yesterday I have to say it was a large and timely journey but I have not been as satisfied with an ending like this one especially with the last fight against Bermuda it was just a very feel good series the whole time. There we many times I laughed it loud and my family was like wtf you laughing at and there were times I got a little annoyed with the plot development aka the first  chapters had little plot development in my opinion and were very slow but it was very good. I have to say this is in my top  series ever and I would highly recommend reading if you havent yet its worth it and I want to watch it but dont know where to so that is my thought on the series. ,khr,d3hyx29,1,t5_2uepx
