1573495,0,t3_2c9yct,This is so absurd its almost funny. The statement is borderline conspiracy theory. Strelkov seems like he may be cracking under the pressure. He cant possibly believe such lunacy. Then again I can totally buy his forces blowing the supplies up as a last stand or while retreating when they are defeated. Plus he can just say look at what those evil Ukrainians did. The guy is a lunatic. ,worldtoday,cjdifen,0,t5_32mx7

When the adrenaline kicks in for the sheeple because the soldiers are knocking at the door down the street or they dont have food or water they will start paying attention to what is really going on.  Thats where WE come in.  Those of us that have been paying attention will be able to bring them up to speed.  Then a new era begins. ,worldtoday,cr1uvnb,6,t5_32mx7

7655926,0,t3_4k5yrg,If Russia was as weak as Iraq Russia would be in the same state as Iraq now note that once mighty Ukraine is weaker than Iraq now. The only way to make Russia as weak as Iraq is to follow Liberals who almost accomplished that before Putin rescued Russia. If Putin continues as he has EU and NATO will collapse in near future. But if he escalates US and EU will have justification to move from largely irrelevant buildup on the Russian border to all out preparation for war. Recall that Russia is outnumbered by US .,worldtoday,d3cfpmh,1,t5_32mx7
