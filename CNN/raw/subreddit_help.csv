Some subreddits allow any level of rudeness and the like as long as you dont break sitewide rules and Im sure some even encourage it.It really depends on the community. Larger subreddits tend to engage in a lot of downvotes are used for disagreement type of thing even though they shouldnt be. Other more wellbehaved communities usually the smaller ones will actually use upvotes and downvotes as theyre supposed to be used  to encourage meaningful discussion and discourage posts that dont add to the discussion.

3958164,0,t3_35s3n2,There are scripts to delete all comments. One Ive used is a greasyfork script but there are browser extensions too I think. If you have rtoolbox installed you can sort by a subreddit by using the search feature toolbox provides on your user comment page. All you would have to do is run the script while it is sorted for that one subreddit. The script automatically goes through and selects delete and confirm for each link it finds on the page.I am on mobile but I am pretty sure it will work. It can only go back  comments though so if youve made more than that since you started posting to the sub you wont get them all. Some google search tricks could find any past the limit.

5958949,0,t3_3wz8ig,This is a collection of advice from myself and others. Find related subreddits You can do so by going here and entering a keyword. If you mod a book subreddit typing books or literature is a good idea and ask the moderators Politely and professionally. Avoid being spammy if theyd like to have a sidebarwikisticky link swap The latter two only if applicable. A link swap is where you place a link to that sub on your sidebarwikisticky and they place a link to yours in theirs. You could try asking if itll be okay to make a post promoting it.. Xpost to subs preferably related assuming the mods are okay with it. To do this simply make a post in your sub and then repost it in another sub and add xpost rYOURSUB to the title. You could use  instead of  if needed. When posted I advise adding a worthwile comment that includes the link to your sub so as to make it easier for mobile users.. See this list of promotional subs and post to them. To get a free official ad try rsubredditads. To buy an offical ad see this page.. Make sure the description is rather descriptive to help it come up in reddit searches.. Reach out to people you think could be interested in viewing the sub. Dont be spammy about this.. Check out metareddit to monitor certain phrases and words that are posted to reddit or just browse related subs. Whenever the subreddit subject is brought up mention your sub. Also on metareddit search for your sub and add relevant tags to it.. Create a social media accounts for your subreddit and postpromote there also. Create a Twitter account for your subreddit and update it using RSS feed  and link that feed to your subreddits twitter account it will automatically update it. Use dlvr or IFTTT for this purpose. Make sure you are active on twitter too otherwise no one will follow it. And promote that twitter account on your subreddit. For a Tumblr blog its not automated like Twitter you have to manually post it however you can use Google Chrome Tumblr Ext. for it. That makes this task easier.And lastly take a look at this guide and this guide Both of which I borrowed from.

10429883,0,t1_dcpu8b5,gt I was trying to submit a selfpost with a link to imgur.Ive seen your post in rTest. For clarity that is not a selfpost. Dammit I forgot to use the new terminology!. A selfpost or textpost as its now known is where you do not submit a link but where you only write text. What youve submitted there is a linkpost its a link to imgur. gt Could it be that I just screwed up the original captcha thing. Thats possible. gt I remember having to do it several times for some reason.Thats a very good indication that you screwed it up! gt i also see no message to the mods. Its in the sidebar of every subreddit  thats the vertical section on the righthand side of the screen on the desktop website. Go to rFeedTheBeast look at the sidebar and scroll down until you find the list of moderators. Theres a tiny link that says message the moderators. gt One thing I was wondering was if the spam filters had a memory. Is it possible that my post got autoflagged as spam saved to file and is just being blocked because I am copypasting almost the exact same thing as a repost? No. Each post is unique and treated separately. However each account has a history. If for whatever reason youve managed to get your account flagged as a bot or spammer for example by screwing up the captcha then every post by your account will be treated as spam. You may even need to contact the Reddit admins about this via this link or by email contactreddit.com  if youve managed to get your account flagged as a bot by screwing up the captcha only they can fix it. gt Thank you for suggesting rTest. Thats pretty neat. Is it just for testing things like this or do people submit to it to see how their post will look? Youll need to ask the moderator of that subreddit. However lots of people use it to test lots of things.  Step  Contact the moderators of rFeedTheBeast. Tell them your problem. See if they have any clues.
