998167,0,t1_chhihir,I dont think the soda would work but maybe I could somehow figure out a way to mimic the flavor by looking at its ingredients or making a sweet and spicy jerky with a lot of ginger flavor. Im not really going for a pineapple specific taste. Im just trying to be utilitarian and use all parts of the pineapple!,jerky,chhqz6v,1,t5_2qpmb

2775227,0,t1_cnj4qx5,Awesome! Longer dehydrating times was the trick! I pushed it to  hours and they lasted all week. Im doing another batch this weekend and I may push it to  hours. I love the texture when it dehydrates for longer as they look like they are store bought now. Thanks so much for the tip!!,jerky,cnjj6v7,2,t5_2qpmb
2905777,0,t3_2tbh7m,Nice! I just whipped up a teriyaki recipe and a spicy Thai recipe last night. Theyre both marinating now Ill probably get it dehydrated this afternoonevening. Im really looking forward to the spicy Thai the teriyaki is for the fiance who doesnt dig on spicy as much as I do.,jerky,cnye5ue,1,t5_2qpmb
3085880,0,t3_2vh8i6,Beautiful.  Ive only ever used flank steak for my jerky but your pictures have definitely conviced me to try top round for my next batch Im thinking pastrami jerky.,jerky,cohulx6,1,t5_2qpmb

5728131,0,t3_3tl128,IMHO you need to be concerned with how long it spends in the danger zone including the time in the dehydrator.  Moisture is a love pit for bacteria so the quicker you can get it above the danger zone and remove as much moisture as possible the safer your product will be.  As far as quality of product Im not really sure it would make a difference but I shall cede opinion to the other enthusiasts.,jerky,cx74pif,2,t5_2qpmb
6050647,0,t3_3w2yej,I have not tried this yet but it is on my list. A  soy and westchester sauce include sliced up hot peppers and black pepper. If you want to go bonkers on heat use capsaicin crystals instead of hot peppers.DANGER! This next part is VERY DANGEROUS so much so that I havent posted it online before. You will make crystals that are around pure capsaicin or  MILLION scoville units. THIS CAN HURT OR KILL YOU IF IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH YOUR SKIN. DONT EAT IT STRAIGHT   I trust that in a highly specialized sub such as this this knowledge will only be used for good and not pranks.  You dont have capsaicin crystals you say?  Get the hottest pepper you can find I prefer ghost peppers slice it up and dehydrate it till crispy. Blend that to a powder and mix with x as much Everclear has to be Everclear or another  abv by volume. Seal and let it sit in the fridge for a week shaking daily. Run the mixture through a coffee filter keep the liquid discard the solids. Put the liquid in a glass container and have a fan blow across the top of it. All the liquid will evaporate leaving red crystals these are near pure capsaicin. Reread the warning above use protective gear gloves goggles and put  or  little pieces I use a toothpick as a measuring device in your marinade and mix well. Taste should contribute almost no flavor but be crazy Spicy.  If it is not spicy enough add crystals one at a time till it meets your needs. I am really not kidding about the danger please be very careful.,jerky,cycqqhp,1,t5_2qpmb

6292753,0,t3_41sq9w,Do you add cure andor tenderizer to your marinade?  Those things help break down the fibers of the meat and infuse more flavor.  I usually use both and  hours is plenty long enough for me to get the flavor profile I am looking for.,jerky,cz4wyoy,1,t5_2qpmb

6391765,0,t1_czg6aye,Its my favorite jerky great beef taste with some good smoke and light seasoning flavor. Hope you enjoy. Also their meats hams turkeys etc are amazingly delicious. ,jerky,czg6ei8,2,t5_2qpmb
6817034,0,t3_493q6s,Lightly wrap it up in butcher paper to absorb any grease.  Shake it around every so often to evenly cool the strips.  If I dont have butcher paper I place the jerky in ziploc punch holes through it to have proper air flow.  Sometimes I run a desk fan into the bag.  Continue shaking the bag to ensure that there isnt any condensation.  I rarely add any more spices to finished jerky.  I taste and take note on what flavors are lacking or too strong and hope I can make it better next batch.  ,jerky,d0p0bni,1,t5_2qpmb
7855968,0,t3_4mtr1g,You know what you can do. Slow cook some salmon at like  for two hours with some liquid smoke brown sugar and honey. That shit will have to addicted. Look up some smoked salmon recipes and replace the smoke with liquid smoke. Your gonna love it.,jerky,d3z2yhq,2,t5_2qpmb

8943126,0,t1_d7m1e4v,This was great info i appreciate taking the time my friend. Im in the US but im thinking the startup and all the info you gave is about the same here. Im a chef by trade so i know all about food safety.. id just really like to have my own business and making jerky has become kind of an obsessive passion of mine seems like a natural kind of progression. After you build your own massive dehydrator does that too have to be inspected before you can use it to sell jerky? Anyway i greatly appreciate the info i hope your business grows and flourishes!,jerky,d7mtyve,2,t5_2qpmb

10113277,0,t1_dbnos48,I hate the traditional soyworcestershireteriyaki bases too.  The only problem Ive found with the dry cure is its tough to get the pieces evenly covered.  Usually a piece turns down on itself and covers up an area.  I started adding a half a beer or so just to distribute things evenly.  I grind pepper over it in the dehydrator before starting as well and a little wet makes it stick better.,jerky,dbproxl,3,t5_2qpmb
10251565,0,t3_5mr5kr,All but one of my recipes have no sugar. I make this lemon garlic jerky everyone loves its  of soy sauce or liquid aminos  lemon juice T of Apple cider vinegar and  tsp of granulated garlic. This is good for up to a pound of meat. No sugar! Also you can make a red chile marinade with  tsp of chili powder  cup soyaminos and  cup Worcestershire..very simple and very good again this would be for a pound of meat as well. Good luck!,jerky,dc62kpg,2,t5_2qpmb
10268340,0,t3_5n1ecc,If you keep the meat cool and have good enough airflow you can dehydrate without any heat. A dehumidifier  heat should work in theory dehumidifiers doesnt work well in the cold but the process might take too long and the meat can go bad. A huge ass fan  fridge would probably be just as easy to do. Or just go on a chilly mountain between c  c and let the wind do its work.To summarize it seems like a lot of effort for the probably same result regular airflow would do. I can make for a nice experiment though. If youre lucky dehumidifiers could be THE method for ensuring even drying you never know.Edit oh and an airtight container wont work since the dehumidifer will have to draw air from somewhere. Otherwise youll end up with a vacuum. Airflow is a must but a couple of inlet holes might do the trick.,jerky,dc7z0sv,5,t5_2qpmb
