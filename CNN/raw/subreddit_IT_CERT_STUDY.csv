270699,0,t3_1x4onq,Security is sort of the catch all certificate and takes care of the requirement for DoD work. It is more valued in security than for example the A plus. A plus is good for hardware work and required to even apply for certain jobs. On the civilian side I have heard the ITIL carries some weight. ,IT_CERT_STUDY,cf8tgu6,2,t5_2sme6

2368291,0,t3_2mhtv5,CCENT is pretty much this  half Net and the other half Cisco basics. If you want a solid foundation but longer time period of studying then start with Net and then go to CCENT or CCNA. If you want to just hit the ground running start off with CCENT and take off from there.,IT_CERT_STUDY,cm4fgvr,2,t5_2sme6

5497757,0,t1_cwedfvn,Domain controller yes! If you want more time and build an environment VirtualBox or any other hypervisor is the way to go. But for short labs on testing a role or a function Microsoft virtual labs are great. I would also suggest getting a book on the specific exams so that you know what you are getting in to. You will need a lot more depth than just knowing how to install the servers. ,IT_CERT_STUDY,cwee2di,2,t5_2sme6
