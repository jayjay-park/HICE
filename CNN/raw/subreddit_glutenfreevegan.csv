1779788,0,t1_ck3gwlp,I honestly just rotate out whatever is on sale at my local nutrition store or at whole foods. Sometimes you can snag a good deal. Amazon stores have cheap pea and soy protein however soy isnt necessarily great for building but it is filling and delicious.  Also watch for bodybuilding.com promos and go in on a bulk order with some friends. Lowers the shipping.,glutenfreevegan,ck3hw89,1,t5_2vvir
2931943,0,t3_2to849,I hear you. Im also allergic to soy so its a trifecta. I cant even go to the one dedicated vegan restaurant in town because every single damn thing on their menu has soy or gluten come on!  I cant trust food at my sister in laws house... Shes vegan prepares things that are GF for me it took almost two years to make it to this point but accidentally puts soy in them nearly every time.I feel bad for people who invite me over to eat. Kind of sick of the question so what CAN you eat? I always end up offering to make the entree and tell people to make a salad.This is me showing up to your pity party. I feel ya.
