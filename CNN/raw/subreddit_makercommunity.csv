10024325,0,t3_5j8ld2,I loosen the tention on my bandsaw when I remember to do it.My scroll saw I usutally end the session with the blade disconneced from the top so I can get my workpiece out after doing an inside cut... so... that tool never has a blade tentioned.Ive seen some people say to release tention on the bandsaw and others say it doesnt matter... seems to be a  split.,makercommunity,dbe74am,3,t5_3htq2
