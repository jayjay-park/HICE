458367,0,t3_1zachp,Come for the city not the school. The professors are pretty good but the classes are horrible if you like engaging and thought provoking discussions this is not the the place. Teachers have to pull out teeth to get some participation going and forget about debating with other students. This is partly due to the amount of asian students  who barely speak english. Most students are not brilliant I expected to be humbled by them but this is was not the case. The city on the other hand is awesome. Mostly if you like tech and going to meetups. The city is a far better educator than USF   would recomend  points due to SF. School of business class of  If you want to chat im happy to help. ,usfca,cfsd67g,1,t5_2spao
1466375,0,t3_1zachp,Its a good environment to take your college career seriously. In other words USF is not a party school and there are too few social events compared to state schools. Most of the majors and departments here are challenging and credited so the educational standard here is great but be prepared to work hard. As previously stated there are a lot of international students so you will most likely have a class each semester where students dont vocally participate due to the language barrier. But that shouldnt stop you from engaging you will be surprised how many people contribute once someone leads the charge. Location is prime you are central to any and all SF activities which are seemingly endless. If you dont have any friends in the bay area already it is harder to make friends at USF than other schools so i would recommend at least one year in the dorms so you meet new people and form relationships that will stay with you. Im an accounting major and our accounting program is fantastic. I apologize I cannot comment on the strength of the science programs however it is typically the case that UC schools have more reputable science degrees. If you got into UCSB UCSC UCSD UCLA etc and are sure about bio take those choices. I work in a clinical diagnostics lab and we pretty much only hire UC grads for RampD and our commercial lab operations. Im not saying that USF doesnt have a great science program there is just a recruitment bias and for more or less good reasons towards UC schools when it comes to bio degrees. tldr fantastic education but the social scene is in the city not the school. ,usfca,cj033gv,1,t5_2spao
