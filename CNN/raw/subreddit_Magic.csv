352541,0,t3_1y3a7t,I had the same fear but now I just do magic that looks fair to me. For example whenever I see an elmsleysivajordanetc... count even if its done well I cringe just because I dont see how anyone can fall for it even though people do.An example of a fair sleight for me would be a second deal. Ive always been afraid of flashing my double lift so whenever I can I use a second deal instead. Its cleaner and IMO easier than a double lift.When you perform fair tricks you get more comfortableconfident and you can perform increasingly unfair tricks. Additionally once you have a repertoire of fair sleights you can modify existing effects to make them fair e.g. If youre uncomfortable with palming from the deck you can use a force and palm a duplicate to the deck. If you dont like doing color changes you can do switches for a slower revelation. There are a lot of solutions just think about what effect you are trying to create and try to apply the sleights you are comfortable with to it.,Magic,cfhb3wp,1,t5_2qh74

978843,0,t1_chf7l95,Do we have to do this?  gt You stated that a magician gets called out because they performed an effect imperfectly. I stated that is not the only circumstance in which a magician may be called out. Im not sure what your point was other then that.Yes we differ in our opinions. I dont know what is so difficult for you to understand. To me there is always something we could do from our side to better ourselves for odd situations. gt As for magicians performing the impossible how is it that Penn amp Teller can use transparent props and stand so that theyre not hiding sight lines but still entertain a crowd?  Then it begs the question are you entertaining or are you performing magic? Though at this point we would have to agree to the definition of magic before we can go down this route. For the record I wouldnt consider that trick magic at all. Tellers Shadow is magic that isnt. It is entertaining however.gt Consider a movie. We know actors cant fly. We know its impossible. We know its probably done with something involving ropes and CGI. We dont sit around going That movie was bullshit people cant fly. Why dont we? Because its important to the story and character that the audience suspend belief. We are entertainers. Any dumbass can perform a tear and restore with an afternoon of practice. But when a somebody wins  on a lottery ticket and I ask to see it then destroy it something special happens. People become engaged. Angry. Shocked. Surprised. They become part of the effect. When I restore it they are relieved confused maybe still angry from being fooled. They went on a journey. They had money spent it for a chance at something get something lost it then got it back or saw it happen to someone. Its not about doing the impossible its about the journey I took them all on. Theyll piece some of it together. That guy must be a magician. Must must have had a similar ticket in his pocket or something. Maybe he carries it around with him all of the time. He must have swapped the tickets before he tore it up. And so on. Theyll know that it wasnt impossible. But that wont change the experience that they had. Even if I flash there will still be some value to the effect. Sure I wont take that person on the full journey itll be cut short for them but theyll still get to see everyone else.I agree with you but I dont see how this is in anyway relevant to what Im trying to propose.gt Magic is about so much more then practicing until its perfect. Its about performing the right way at the right time for the right people. Its about emotions. Its about fun. Its about taking someone for a moment and showing them that the world is pretty cool. The impossible is just one tool we use to accomplish that.Youre damn right it is more than just being perfect in terms of technique but how many of the magicians out there have close to perfect technique? Even the gods we magicians hail ourselves see Darwin Ortiz have stiff awkward hands. The man has brilliant tricks but the handling leaves a lot to be desired.,Magic,chfjwvs,1,t5_2qh74

1790743,0,t1_ck4sx35,Thanks for the reply. My definition of camera trick would be similar to yours Any trick where you couldnt replace the camera operator with an uninitated audience member without shattering the illusion. E.g. a flying rig thats only invisible because its carefully kept outside of the frame.However while Copperfield certainly was no stranger to those tricks Off the top of my head I can think of Portal the demolition escape and  to a lesser extent  the levitating railroad car. Im sure there are more. it seems to me that most of his big illusions were made in such a way that they would work for live audience members as well. E.g. the flying illusion the walk though the Chinese Wall even the vanishing Statue of Liberty  at least as long as you were sitting in the official audience area. With a show like Mindfreak on the other hand theres so much obvious room for trickery with stooges camera angles and editing even with Street Magic type tricks that I just dont get any sense of wonder from them anymore. If the magic is created in the editing room instead of in front of the camera its just not the same for me.To make it clear Im not trying to paint Copperfields heyday as some kind of golden age of magic  hes just my point of reference because he was the big name in the business when I grew up. It simply seems to me that  while he did use and maybe eben pioneer I dont know enough about the trade to know that a lot of those camera and editing tricks in some of his illusions many of the modern star magicians seem to place a much greater emphasis on them making at least their TV work seem less impressive to me.Again it might very well just be nostalgia or selective memory on my part.,Magic,ck4vhe8,1,t5_2qh74
1791292,0,t1_ck4vmwr,Yeah I feel like good illusions should retain the immediacy of theatre effects They should work in front of a live audience no afterthefact editing required.

That being said the person you were with did not react nearly as much as he should have. Its because showmanship is key to this trick. I really liked the ending of yours but Id like to offer a few tips.  try to make a story of some sort so the numbers arent just random. Have a reason for getting those numbers its great that you let him hit equals and showed him after you typed every number. But I usually never want to turn the phone away. I keep it in clear view the whole time. If not people get very suspicious.  Milk the ending. Make sure to emphasize how crazy it is. Reiterate how he came up with all the numbers and stuff like that. Its such an excellent little trick that can be done anywhere. The reactions when done properly are awesome.Good luck. ,Magic,crm71u6,1,t5_2qh74

4616802,0,t1_ctch02n,Look if you dont see exposure as a problem youre deluding yourself. Nothing is more deflating than to perform for a small group and then to have one of the audience members say I know how you did that and explain to everybody present a comically incorrect and completely different method of achieving the same effect. You clearly dont take this obligation very seriously but I actually do believe that as magicians we have a real ethical obligation to the magicians before us who developed the techniques we use to the modern day creators of magic effects and to the people who practice magic professionally to not expose our secrets. This obligation is codified in the magicians oath and the code of ethics of all professional magic organizations. Heres a link to the joint IBM and SAM statement of ethics   Nevertheless I know that nothing Im going to say is going to convince you that your belief is wrong. So let me ask you whats the problem with having a private subreddit with a low barrier to entry for discussing techniques?    gtIt should be the job of the moderators to decide what is real discussion among magicians and whats is trash to be removed.And the low barrier of entry to rMagicSecrets helps to ensure that all discussion there is productive discussion between magicians.  gt To be clear I am simply proposing that we be allowed to have real engaging and educational discussions with experienced and amateur magicians. im not proposing that we link to illegal downloads or have people revealing current FISM acts.And Im simply telling you that this is not the proper forum.

4769201,0,t3_3g4yon,you nailed it! great job and you are absolutely correct about the tricks. bigger tricks always work better. I busk for most of my money and I make about  to  a day. I usually work about  hours so there is some perspective. You are absolutely on the right track . here are some insights if you want. almost everything you say I completely agree with and you are dead on about talking loud and how when you get a crowd it makes a crowd. tricks dont draw people people draw people. you are totally right about the type of tricks you should do! big tricks always play better and they are always best if you have something crazy to say when you are doing it. but dont throw out your deck just yet its always good to have something on the back burner in case someone approaches you afterwardsBusking is not just magic. Busking is street theater. You are AN ACTOR playing the part of a wizard.One thing I think you are close to the right track on  but not exactly correct is when you made the statement speed is key . speed is not key. PACEING is key. You have to speed up and slow down depending on how you are manipulating the crowd. Busking is in itself a fast paced thing so youre right you should go fast but if you slow down just enough at the right moment you can get a bigger gasp or a bigger applause which would draw even more people. This is something I am still experimenting with every day. I think its awesome that other magicians are out busking. Dont stop believing. ,Magic,ctvp93f,5,t5_2qh74

And then did the same effect with another method and they DIE.With time you will learn how to put people in place. Sometimes you have to be funny some times you have to get them hands on and sometimes you have to walk away and pick you battles.

4876922,0,t3_3hmre7,ACR is an effect everyone has its own variation on. I would advise you not to go for more than threefour phases and to always try to outdo yourself the more you go into the trick.Simple is the key here theres no point doing  complicated moves to bring the card back to the top  times. I usually make it rise once then make it rise to the top of the portion the spectator is holding and end with the classic bent card that pops out on the top of the pack. phases stronger and stronger and always great reactions. ,Magic,cu99vp9,2,t5_2qh74

4996642,0,t3_3jdh74,Dont act sloppy. Theres no such thing as sloppy and good card magic. Even Lennart Green at his prime of chaos is super smooth precise and accurate with his card handling.The whole point of being soft and smooth with your card handling is to allow the effect to show itself with extreme clarity. Clarity is probably the most important presentation for your spectators. You dont want to fuck about like an amateur. It invites heckling and disturbs your spectators.On the other hand there is a HUGE difference between doing cardistry and magic. Its the INTENT that counts. If you want your magic to appear covert dont do fancy stuff. Take a false cut for example doing a sybil is showing off and tipping off the fact that youre not doing anything covert. A clean false cut would be a much better choice for magic because you want your magic to be covert.EDIT Doing cardistry also doesnt establish you as a person familiar with cards. Like magic there are TONS of card bunglers as well.,Magic,cuoa5j1,1,t5_2qh74

5652379,0,t1_cwxpz5l,Sounds like a good plan  I dont know how much youve dabbled in music but a tip I heard for general practice of Magic that would definitely help if you wanted to perform to music is to practice sleights and routines to a metronome. Itll give you a sense of timing and pacing. If you do it correctly you wont fall into the trap of performing too quickly or too slowly depending on the desired effect.

If you have a script you can safely go back to the script if something happens. It allows you to adlib and improvise lines while still knowing where to go after. Be big. If you are on stage you need to be big! you cant keep actions small and tight to your body. This may be difficult for a close up performer who is close to their body all the time but as a close up guy you need to be big as well.look nice. this was mentioned below but make sure that your clothes are ironed straight your hair is combed and nails look nice. get a manicure if you want to learn how to make your nails look good. Also dont chew gum but use breathmints or spray. carry a toothbrush or something similar in your kit for quick cleans. Bring hand sanitizer when doing shows especially walk around where you shake peoples hands. DO NOT BELITTLE YOUR AUDIENCE. Do not make fun of someone and put them down for the sake of the show. I have seem magicians get away with this but it was part of their character or they were able to reverse the process making the person feel good again afterwards. Remember names when performing. If you are not great at it at least let them know you are trying to remember their name. A good way is to either associate the person with someone else you know with the same name or make a little rhyme joke Sara Boberra Slim Jim Etc. it will help you remember.Stand up straight.Check out Maximum entertainment for more information!,Magic,cx5vgwk,1,t5_2qh74

Im also a member of themagiciansforum whose session room members with more than  posts host regular online hangouts.  Those online hangouts benefit me far more.

7836255,0,t1_d3wrd5n,I have two main sets of material.The first are structured routines.  These are my gambling demonstrations my card magic set and my mentalism set.  Those are about half hour to  minute stuff that I can lengthen and I will only do that if asked to perform a show.  Ive also been experimenting with hypnosis dont think its going to work out and am currently working on another set with a supernatural theme has a long way to go.  With all my stuff I like effects to flow into each other but give the audience appropriate time to breathe.As for walkaroundpartiesrestaurant work a lot of my stuff is pretty modular and have multiple climaxes and phases so I can end based on where I feel is right.  Typically I will end after  multiphase tricks and always announce that when Im about to hit the big finish.  That way I can give the audience a sense that they saw a full show and Im not just leaving them if they expect more taking your bow while theyre still clapping is great.  If I feel they want more like they ask for more Ill say What the heck because you guys have been so great.  That really lets them feel like theyre getting to see something special and unique more than what everyone else is seeing.  Dont be afraid to link other people if you notice other people are watching address them directly and smile.Its hard for me to give advice because this is something Im still learning.  Really the question for length is to be just enough to entertain them but not enough to outstay your welcome.  That is really dependent on the audience.  I have trouble reading moods sometimes and having learnt so many tricks theres always the temptation to show off all of them.  After all I put in so much work I want people to see it.  Lately Ive been cutting early on purpose.  I feel its better to cut too early than too late but Im definitely not doing it optimally.The stuff I do for children may not always be short because I feel like if you just do one quick trick for a kid people tend to see you as a childrens performer.  Id much rather try and link and spin off the routine to involve more than the kids unless Im doing a gig for children which I dont really do and I hear is completely different.  For example I have full phase stuff like spongeballs that may start with the kids when the kids want to see a trick but by the end were doing stuff with the whole family.  I may start by doing the whole make a spongeball appear in the kids hands then say why dont we try it with mommy or daddys.  That brings the adults in and reframes the performance.  I can then do some solo spongeball stuff entertaining everybody I dont talk silly I find in my context kids prefer it if I talk normally maybe make some jokes but always do magic.  Then I can decide who I want to help me for the big finish but itll usually be one of the other kids and one of the adults at the same time.  Really the shortest routines I do are for drunk people.   I never do long routines for drunk people.  The longest routine I do for drunk people is Recapped by Gregory Wilson and thats as a finisher.So for your final question I prefer modular stuff.  It stops you from having to fish in your pockets for coinscardsetc... and gives the sense of a full show in  minutes but at the same time I can stop.  However if I do encores or revisit people I may be able to get away with a single trick then talk to them for a bit tell them about myself ask them questions then more on to another quick miracle.  This has the advantage of letting me try out new stuff and keeps the pace flowing.  Once again I cant really give a definitive answer because this is something Im still kind of learning and experimenting with.,Magic,d3wv28c,3,t5_2qh74
7839374,0,t1_d3wv28c,Thanks for the reply. Ive been experimenting with lengths of performances as well. Usually Ive found that those initially less open to magic and who are colder towards me respond best to an initial wow moment and then I offer a chance to see the next step as it were. Then I can usually build for a bit longer before the end. However those who are excited to see magic from the getgo respond better when the effect is built up a bit more.

7910379,0,t1_d456qas,Of course asking questions and asking for help is a valid part of a learners journey but I personally always refrained from asking about specific material that I saw other magicians perform. To me it was just a respect thing I figured that theyd worked hard to findrefinetunecreate material that suited them and it wasnt my business where they found it or how they went about finding it. What I did however was ask questions such as What books do you recommend for a beginnernoviceintermediate magician interested in sleight of hand with cards? and Which performers do I have to go see? and so on. This approach took me on an amazing journey of reading a lot of books going to a lot of conventions tracking down a lot of my heroes and idols in magic which in turn led me to a lot of unique pieces of magic and I learnt a lot of really valuable lessons along the way. Instead of directly asking Whered you find that trick? which is what Weber dubs Seesickness You see someone do a trick and then you figure youre going to do it too I found it was much better to just ask the broader questions and then do the work myself. Everyone else had to do it why shouldnt I have to? What makes me entitled to know their trade secrets  literally all the hard work thats paying their bills? Nothing.When I occasionally perform for fellow magicians theyre completely unfamiliar with  of the material I do and I think thats a fantastic thing. Were supposed to do the impossible the unique the different  so why do we have to go around copying each other and all do the same tricks? Yes I still do the classics. I still do Triumph I do transpositions I do time travel plots I do ace routines  but the specific variations and the specific approaches to each effect I took great care in hunting down and seeking out specifically in an attempt to separate what I do from what everyone else does.Tldr Nothing wrong with asking for help. Just think its a bit lazy to ask Whered you find that trick?.  Thanks for bringing it up. Its an important question. Sorry if there seemed to be any contradictions. ,Magic,d4579ft,6,t5_2qh74

How do people find your site in the first place? How do you get people to come to it? If there is a magic society that is giving away free web promotional sites and that magic society is well known and their web siteforum has high traffic it would be good to have your promotional stuff on a website associated with that magic society. Sadly I have not heard of such a society giving away websites. So it is probably a false rumour. The only real solution to this is to get good get a good reputation.

Someone names a card if its a normal deck theres a  chance that card is in the deck.Someone names a number theres a  in  chance that card will be there.  It just isnt that great.  After talking with another magician I respect very much Ive entirely dropped any routine where a selected card is found in the deck.  Unless theres something magical like a color change or a sandwich or cards reversing etc its LITERALLY the least you could do.  Theres a card in the deck you found a card in the deck.  Cards belong in decks its not very magical.  Think about them selecting a card and now its in your shoe or on the ceiling or folded up in your mouth etc etc. For spectators its too easy to chalk up ACAAN to just coincidence and theyre not really wrong. If someone said ten of clubs and another spectator said left shoe and there was a ten of clubs in your left shoe now were talking because tens of clubs are generally not in left shoes.,Magic,d6c9owb,5,t5_2qh74

9636234,0,t3_5czmp0,I was working a childrens party and was doing the classic rabbit out of a hat routine.  Probably about thirty kids watching.  I was using a toy stuffed rabbit with these big goofy eyes.  I had just flipped the hat over and was reaching into it when my pyro misfired igniting the rabbit.  It startled me and I jerked my arm back knocking the flaming hat into a pile of silk scarves from a previous effect.  They went up in a blaze that set off the fire alarm and sprinkler systems.  The children started screaming and running around.  Two collided and blood gushed out of their noses like an air hose stuffed into a vat of nacho cheese.  One of the dads sprinted towards the table and attempted to stomp out the fire.  He kicked some of the cinders into a pile of wresting mats that caused the foam to slowly smolder.  Two moms blocked the only exit when their oversized strollers locked together in an attempt to flee the chaos.  Another large woman shoved one of the women so hard she flipped over top of the stroller pile and tore her ACL.  The wrestling mat candle finally ignited in a fire ball as the thirty screaming children trampled each other.  After about seven minutes the fire department arrived to a charred crater that use to be the recreation center.  I stood there in shock holding a partially melted goofy plastic eye.

Heres a summary of what a Strawman isA straw man is logical fallacy that occurs when a debater intentionally misrepresents their opponents argument as a weaker version and rebuts that weak amp fake version rather than their opponents genuine argument. Intentional strawmanning usually has the goal of  avoiding real debate against their opponents real argument because the misrepresenter risks losing in a fair debate or  making the opponents position appear ridiculous and thus win over bystanders.Unintentional misrepresentations are also possible but in this case the misrepresenter would only be guilty of simple ignorance. While their argument would still be fallacious they can be at least excused of malice,Magic,dbdy7d5,1,t5_2qh74

First of all youre super extreme friends wont break up with you because youre not telling them how you got the card to the top of the deck... Ive never been in a situation where someone has gave me an ultimatum of its me or the method. Normal people only care about how its done so they arent fooled. Like every other feeling in the range of human emotions it fades sure they might pester you for an hour after but a few hours later theyre talking about something totally different.Also why do you seem so pissed at magicians selling their secrets? Noone would be here if magicians didnt sell their secrets. If everyone kept their secrets magic wouldve died out long before Reginald Scot wrote his expose. Not just FISM winners lots of magicians do. Magicians arent bad if they sell a secret they want to pass that principle on for people to use publish the method as a sort of patentso they can claim creation they want monetary gain.

10336783,0,t1_dcfpck1,gt What Ive seen is magicians moving away from things that obviously came from a magic shop the chrome tubes and such. Even sponge balls. even though the audiences love sponge balls some magicians deprecate them. Thats why you see the socalled Street magicians doing tricks with common objects rather than say the Linking Rings which might as well be labeled Magic Apparatus! in flashing letters.This is exactly my thoughts on magic... Hence why I dont perform or particularly want to perform most of the things from the list. I just dont like performing with unnecessary props.If Im bringing out a change bag to vanish something firstly most change bags look like magic apparatus and nothing like people have seen before secondly if I could vanish something why would I need to put it in a bag? At least the classic magician prop looks alien anyway you can make change bags out of anything but still an extra prop to vanish something is unnecessary in my mind.The Dai Vernon example is perfect and I think its very much the professors theory on magic in a practical context. He was always talking about natural motion and performing naturally. A great example of this trick with actual reallife nonalien props is the linking finger rings. I think bringing out something unnatural or overly eye catching like dreadful s sparkly designs on magic props is just as bad as doing a bad move or a obvious move in card magic maybe they wont know what happened but theyll attribute the magic to that moveprop. It breaks the suspension of disbelief between the audience and their imagination...,Magic,dcfqdpj,1,t5_2qh74

If you want some really tough stuff Guy Hollingworth has a ton of great stuff in Drawing Room Deceptions like Waving the Aces and a production of four aces using a jacket. I would also recommend a Hofzinser ace trick. Dan and Daves Hoffzy Osbourne is a good standup version.But more importantly you need to tie it together with patter. Whats the deal with the aces? Are they misbehaving cards that act of their own accord? Do they have strange properties because theyre the highest cards in the deck? Doing tricks with aces or any tricks left and right isnt going to be impactful without good patter.,Magic,dd5bhx4,2,t5_2qh74
10578446,0,t3_5rgrt9,My other post has been up the top of this sub for the last  hours so I wanted to give you guys something. This post actually covers some FREE presentations for effects using observational mentalism. If youre looking to find out more on the subject Peter Turner has a great ebook on the subject that covers more indepth routines from some great minds in magic. ,Magic,dd731sl,0,t5_2qh74

10783050,0,t3_5u66hu,Hi I usually try and point them where to find the answers for their inquiry. If its a sold effect Ill tell where to pick it up and maybe some good alternative resources on how to use it.  If it is in a book and new ill let the come over and read from my library. If its an older effect from a book that is over ten years old ill usually transcribe it or copy it as they allow at the magic castle.   Dvds ill let them borrow or they can come over and watch.   If its something ive created im usually pretty open about it...except for a few things. ,Magic,dds6ym6,3,t5_2qh74
10788551,0,t3_5ubexu,Hey everyone  this is a video I put together with some thoughts and tips on packing a travel friendly magic show. It was in response to a subscribers question on my YouTube channel. I hope you find something help in it and let me know if you have questions or topics that you would be interested in having me address in future videos. Thank you!,Magic,ddsrg4j,1,t5_2qh74

10857596,0,t1_ddzsuhy,gt Are you pigeonholing Swiss just because he can write well?Not at all. For one thing I dont think he can write well. He happens to be one of the few magicians writing about the more theoretical side of magicbut it would be a mistake to confuse tackling deeper subjects with writing well. Many years ago I made the mistake of battling through Shattering Illusions. These days Id have the confidence to put it down early on.The arrogance is there for all to see from the introduction where he claimsgtI am perhaps more rarely fooled than many othersto the point where he is keen to stress thegtdemands on my schedule not only for my convention appearances but also for time spent shooting a number of future video projectsLets not forget the condescension of a phrase likegt I long ago gave up attempting to correct such common misapprehensionsor the point where he says that unlike other magicians studying the routine he was special becausegt when I watched the video I not only understood that Mr. Earl did not require a prearranged deck but I also did not believe that Penn amp Teller would take part in deceiving their audience in this fashionTheres also a general arrogance in the premise Earl is good because he managed to fool someone as hard to fool as me. The way he frames his compliment is to make it all about himself.So theres no pigeonholing. Just responding to what he wrote. Yes were all flawed. One point of a board like this is to discuss other peoples flaws. I think its fair gameespecially my points about the issues with the routine which he completely misses. I think there is stuff for people to learn from therewhich I hope does not come across as arrogant for me to say.gtPatter can often blind spectators even if theyre magicians.Absolutely. But appreciate the irony. After Swiss has attacked the fantasists on the magic forums who were fooled by the PATFU routine he is another online fantasist who has shown himself to be blind to some really quite major mistakes which he would certainly criticise in another performer he did not like.,Magic,ddzvulx,2,t5_2qh74
10916931,0,t1_de5z76y,Awesome.   Here are some that are still available to consider   The Collected Almanac  Kaufman. This is full of some great close up by the best magicians of its time. There are some real gems in this book.    Any David Regal books  Close up and Personal and or Approaching Magic are great choices.    The Darwin Ortiz theory books   The new Bannon stuff is good   I want to put way more but in looking a lot are out of print. ,Magic,de605zn,2,t5_2qh74

11004849,0,t1_def5z8d,I am about to share soley my belief on thisBecause this is an area that there is no right vs. wrong theory is just that theory. But it really helps hearing insight from professionals and using it to your style. Plus a channel dedicated to just this would become more boring to some people Chris Ramsey does some stuff on magic theory As do others so the videos are out there just not in one place or for one channel. ,Magic,defd9sd,2,t5_2qh74

11070198,1,t3_5y32ym,LampL publishing has Paul Wilsons Royal Road DVD set selling for  on penguin. Thats just DVDs. It would cost another  for another two decks of cards and a brand new book of RR. For those of you who view the purchase as a money grab how and why is this any different. Royal Road is a beginners book why would someone need an  set to START. Ill tell you why. PEOPLE LIKE VISUALS. Erdnase as far as I know has never had a set dedicated to the sleights and the philosophies behind them. I do not doubt many more such videos will come from others. But how many of you that are disgusted by the product actually watched the material? How many people ACTUALLY KNOW what Madison has to say on ANYTHING. For those that just think Madison is a prick or whatever you should probably reconsider your naivety of judgement. Dai Vernon the GREATEST MAGICIAN EVER was noted as being an asshole to his pupils like Diaconis and Ricky Jay. Yet people still love him. Madison comes out on a promo video says something inflammatory and a bunch of people got triggered. And not only that HE EXPLAINS HIS REASONING FOR USING THE PHRASE Im the bestBut no one wants to watch that video cuz they all think hes an asshole,Magic,demsorg,3,t5_2qh74
