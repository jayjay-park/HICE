You have a good GMAT good GPA good undergrad school amp degree and you work for a huge prestigious company.    I honestly dont think that MBA programs care that much about promotions since most people have only worked  years before entering. I think they care more about leadership potential which they will read in your recommendations.      Keep in mind that leadership does not only mean that people report to you. It can be project leadership too. Dont sell yourself short.    I cant comment on the value of volunteer work but I had basically none and got into Michigan and UNC with similar stats as you also an engineer.    I cant really comment on your career path since I am not familiar with it sorry about that.

1112924,0,t1_chus7y6,Hi!  Yes I had plenty of friends who were international students older than .  As for jobs I dont think age or internationalUS citizen really makes that much of a difference.  A lot of it comes down to what youve done in your own experiences and how you can form the story to explain why you fit into that firms rolestructure.  Many students including myself change industry from engineering to finance from media to marketing and we even had an exprofessional poker player enter consulting.  There are plenty of job opportunities during on campus recruiting and off of Cornells campus that in my experience are equally open to internationals.  Certainly there are some positions that the company cant or wont sponsor a visa for international candidates but again it was rare.As for job prospects not being bright I think for this years Johnson class has more than  of its class with accepted job offers with average salary of k and average signing bonus of k.  So yes while it might seem scary to get into debt for the first time it really is something you should feel comfortable doing if you really feel an MBA can help you achieve what you want out of your career.I hoped this helps a little bit.

2700364,0,t3_2qyle2,Im sorry you apparently didnt get what you wanted out of the program you attended. What you wrote may apply to a bunch of lower ranked US schools but it doesnt apply to any of the top schools in the US.gt  you got yourself a  hole to dig yourself out of. If your pay increases by  a year its a . year payback.Incoming salaries to a full time top program are around k. First year salaries at graduation are k  bonus with a generally expected promotion and salary bump after  year on the job. Pay back of loans is pretty quick. Theres also an internship over the summer that adds a bit of cash to the equation.gt  MBA programs flat out lie to you. Their employment stats are a lie.The good programs dont. I dont know anyone that hasnt been able to find a job after graduating.gtThey carry themselves like its a highschool.ok?gt MBAs are widely known to throw as much irrelevant work at you rather than a reasonable amount of quality work at you.Not really. It all depends on what you want to do. If youre not going to do anything with marketing dont put a lot effort in to the core marketing class. The bigger problem is theres so much going on that there isnt enough time to do everything. This isnt a bad thing. You just have to pick the events you want to go to and how much grades matter to you in specific classes.gt  So it was almost exclusively people with that experience that went back into the field. And everyone else was shut out. When I look across LinkedIn most people seem to have jobs they could have got without an MBA. This one at least at a top school in the US is flat out false. I know lots of people that make major career changes without long backgrounds in that career path.,MBA,cnb0rqd,5,t5_2rbd9
2703273,0,t1_cnbccg3,When you go through on campus recruiting which the vast majority of people do you get offered a standard pay package that they offer to pretty much everyone theyre hiring for that position straight out of school. So if youre going to CPG youre going to get the same amount as everyone else getting hired at Clorox for that specific job straight out of business school.Thats really why theres very little variability in average pay out of all the top schools. The only thing that changes the average pay is the mix of people that go in to specific industries. So a school thats finance heavy will have a higher average starting salary than a school thats known for sending a lot of people in to CPG.When  of your graduates are getting hired within a couple months of graduation and the vast majority of them are through OCR which requires you report your salary to the school Id say there isnt much if any bias introduced.This is why theres a huge bias from a lot of people around here to go to a top school or nothing and the same reason why some people discourage others from applying to lower ranked schools.What you say is absolutely  true for the average business school in the US. There isnt a lot in the way of career services. The average salaries arent huge and OCR isnt all that great. Thats not to say its pointless to go to but the ROI is much more difficult.For the top  or  schools though? Youd have to actually insult the recruiters or flat out not go through OCR not to get a job at graduation.,MBA,cnbcohk,3,t5_2rbd9

3128452,0,t3_2vzgjp,Disclaimer I did a lot of reading on this topic recently in preparation for my own process of school selectionapplications however I didnt apply to any top ten programs. Here is what I learned....Fact  The GMAT is what MBA programs look for not the GRE although they will accept the GRE in many cases to supplement a poor score on the GMAT.Fact  The GMAT is slightly harder than the GRE.Fact  If you are in the th percentile on both sections of the GRE you are preforming AVERAGE on a slightly easier exam than the GMAT. IMO  Your GPA is low and your undergrad school is not a top tier undergrad program. IMO  Top  programs dont accept average candidates. Median scores are all  GMAT for Top  programs. Most Top s have median scores of . IMO  Your vet status may help you but everyone that applies to top  MBA programs has exceptional work history and exceptional academic credentials. My Recommendation Wait  more year to go to an MBA program and do the following Take the GMAT as soon as possible plan to take it twice. Add a year to your work history and start looking for recommendation letters from highly senior managers. Volunteer and build a solid track record of social leadership with supporting recommendations. Complete a difficult and well respected professional certificate and consider retaking any highly quantitative classes that you didnt get at least an A in during college. Make sure you get an A in them if you retake them. Lets say for example you got a B in Calculus or something  retake that class and get an A. It wont help your GPA or your transcripts but you can add it to supplement them and show your desired program that  you have the ability to preform at a high level  you have the desire to preform at a high level.  ,MBA,com9fz2,3,t5_2rbd9

3954958,0,t1_cr723pm,Thanks for the feedback! The truth is an MBA especially at a top business school provide unrivalled education in completely relevant practically applicable topics. I certainly and Im sure many other people too feel that a lot of their education is spent taking classes and studying things that seem a bit pointless and not applicable enough to the real world or can develop a career significantly. But I think the reason I really want an MBA is because its exactly the type of broad but relevant education that I want that isnt available at my current level. I especially like Harvards case study method which particularly appeals to me. Why the US? I think I have always seen the value in spending at least some time abroad to put you out of your comfort zones. Many people wouldnt even be considered for a CEOCFO position without international business experience so I think this kind of plays into that. Im intending on doing a year long secondment upon graduation with the business I mentioned for the same reasons. Also purely the reputation of US business schools is a huge driving factor. The MBA is probably most respected in the US to my knowledge so it makes sense to get one somewhere that delivers them best.

Suppose that  of people took the GMAT and the average score was a . Suppose the average GRE score converts to a  using ETSs conversion tool. Using those figures the weighted average would be a .

You have that opinion for a reason.Im a bit biased Im working my way through a casebased MBA and Im loving the method. You need good teachers so dont step down for it but I hear that Kellogg has a fantastic case program.  Im also in a smaller program thats picked their international students very carefully.The flights are going to make your costs equal to move and do a fulltime program. You may also want to consider the year program at Kellogg... As far as Im concerned these are the things you should look for from an MBA program. Network quality and access. Oncampus recruiting and career services support.. Employer rankings of graduates. Alumni rankings of the school.M is M  but there are differentiating factors between them. I also came to an MBA with a k salary I found the Bloomberg business week rankings very helpful as they aligned with what I was looking for.  Im not saying take them at face value but look at what the rankings say about each school you are considering on the metrics you care about.Your concerns should be ROI and be heavily weighted on opportunity cost.  If you are putting withe work in to getting into the M etc. programs then it really doesnt matter which one you take. Its not like Kellogg is that much better than Sloan but there will be certain differentiating factors that you need to find and determine what matters to you.If it were my  cents Id pick a case method school with a strong alumni network in the firms I want to be recruited into. I would visit each school and attend a sample class in each.If network is your main concern fulltime will leave you better off. Your previous post indicated that you were happy where you were and wanted the MBA to move you up in your current org.

There is no reason for you to thinking about an MBA yet. For example if you decide you want to be a software engineer you will not need it to succeed.. If however youre a software engineer already and want a change than youd do an MBA. If you end up going into IB depending on your goal you may end up needing the MBA.. But you dont have to. . Not really. MBA assumes no prior background in any of those. Of course if you took operations management class youd do better in your MBA OM class because youd already know the content but than whats the point right? Focus on things YOU like and take those.. I honestly dont know how to answer that its hard to say.. It depends on the decisions you make and where you end up.. You could be in engineering come up with something cool and be rich.. You could have an MBA and still not have a job. . Yes and No. It prepares you to manage a business not start one. You cold take entrepreneurship classes that could help you start a business and operate it well.. But you dont really need an MBA to do that. You need a goal. From what youve said seems like your goal MAY be to make money.. If that is the case and youd like to make money by working for others than do Finance at a top undergrad school gt Investment Banking gt Private Equity gt MBA gt Private Equity. Obviously everything has pros and cons. IBPE means you work  hours a week and have no life in your early s.,MBA,d3x8sgi,2,t5_2rbd9

8036122,0,t1_d4jalyv,My school did not allow any electronics. Tablets while ostensibly useful for notetaking Ive never once seen someone actually do this in a business setting other than when iPods first started getting big and IT teams bought them for executives who would use them for a week then just bring them to meetings while still taking notes on paper they can still be a distraction particularly to those around you.Having gone through schools both with laptops allowed and with no electronics allowed I find the latter far more useful. Youre largely taking notes not on blank paper but on coursepackets so the blankness of a tablet isnt wholly useful. And there will still be days in some courses where you need a laptop to do an exercise or where youre meeting in a teamroom before andor after with your group and need to do quite a bit of Excel. ,MBA,d4jc32c,1,t5_2rbd9

9092498,0,t3_54ror7,MBA programs are adapting or more accurately some of them to create more paths to acquiring your masters degree. I work very closely with recruitment and admissions at a business school in the Pacific Northwest. Applicants to our MBA for Professionals program come from a wide set of diverse employment and professional backgrounds. Think of applying to MBA programs like applying to a job  your perceived weaknesses are typically only going to weight you down if you fail to show a pattern of forward progress  and it sounds like youre in that forward progress phase with your recent career moves. That might not make you an attractive candidate to the supercompetitive programs that are focused almost exclusively on postgrad placements a mistake in my opinion because statistically you represent a risky admit on paper. Lowertier schools would probably be your best bet but I would be super selective and careful about your choice as you likely would anyway right?.One other thing to think about  the earlier in your career you earn your MBA the more time you have for it to pay off moving forward.

10604247,0,t3_5rqfmi,So the way you would look at a PhD program is going to be much different from the way you look at the MBA program.  This is because you are probably less concerned with the on campus recruiting at the PhD level but more so looking at how well you will fit within the department since you will be spending  years there and how well they can help facilitate the research process. Also you are looking to work with specific faculty who can help you move your thesis along to make yourself a compelling part of the class.  The issue is that depending on what specifically you want to study and how well you think youd get along with some of the faculty your choices would change dramatically.  You may find more benefits in attending a lower ranked school because it is a better fit. The output in a PhD program is significantly different in the sense that it is research based and you play a big part in what you will learnexplore as opposed to having a bank of classes that you are selecting from to help you craft a paradigm that will compete in the marketplace.

11111366,0,t3_5ynl0p,Hard to say without more knowing more.  What industries do you have experience with or is it all generalist?  How long have you been at your PE firm?  Have you only worked on domestic deals or do you have any meaningful international experience?  All that stuff matters a lot.Obviously very good ECs which will help make you stand out since so many IBPE candidates have minimal ECs. Engineering degree probably helps too.  Good GMAT but not enough to differentiate from people with your profile.FWIW I have a similar profile IB to PE with nowhere close to the ECs but with higher GMATGPA and I got interviews and offers in R at a few of your target schools.  Youll need good essays and a good story but Wharton Booth and Sloan are definitely all in your wheelhouse.  HS who knows.,MBA,dergpm5,1,t5_2rbd9
11131936,0,t3_5yy25r,I work in a longish hour engineering industry hrs per week but nothing like extreme IB hours so my advice might not help but...I find its easier to volunteer time to causes youre passionate about because youre invigorated to help even after long hours. For me that means helping low income kids prepare for college tutoring and other random community service projects. Those are pretty basic ECs nothing stellar but still good. Rockstar tier would be starting something like a nonprofit or scholarship fund but that would take a lot of dedication so if youre not fully invested in it then it might not pan out. Also something like Peace Corps but that will be lifestyletime dependent. For most of the people Ive talked to their ECs are mostly giving up weekends with the occasional late night writing requests for funding or drawing up plans for large projects maybe calling vendorsetc. ,MBA,detsmg7,7,t5_2rbd9

11304439,0,t3_61brtg,The Venn diagram of the two programs and the ensuing opportunities has vastly more overlap than difference.Yes Booth is a more quant heavy school even their class selection scheme as a points based futures market is hilarious to me while Kellogg is certainly less solargely due to its historical reputation and success in marketing careers.I cannot speak to the entrepreneurship outcomes of the two schools. Others will need to chime in on that but I believe Booth may have a slight edge here.The campus experience is the main difference. Kellogg students almost all live in Evanston within walking distance of campus. The purple line and Metra provide access to the city ifwhen you feel like doing that. Kelloggs new building is also mind blowing probably the best facilities of any MBA program.Conversely Booth students almost all live in the Chicago downtown loop or south loop areas and take the Metra or CTAbus in to one of the stops near campus. You will still make all the kinds of social connections that you make in any other MBA program its just that there is a wider distribution of livingeatingdrinking locations than for Kellogg students.To me I think the cash is an easy decider in the favor of Booth. The ROI more than makes up for any deficiencies in campus life which I dont think there are many. If cash was no issue and youre leaning Kellogg you should email them with your Booth offer and ask them to match.Great quandry for you to have. Best of luck to you! Chicago is an amazing city and you and your amazingly large dome will have the time of your life no matter which program you wind up in.,MBA,dfdcaoa,15,t5_2rbd9

This includes telling a consistent story in your essays and interviews having the ECs to back it up and getting good LORs to support it. Think of how many applications out there that dont have well articulated goals or dont understand the culture of a school. Your solid application will stand out.This works all the way up to the top . As long as you have the average stats you can stand out with good execution. When you hit the top  and m though things start getting harder and you will probably need more punch in the application.,MBA,dg8sp32,3,t5_2rbd9

11765801,0,t3_67u2s2,With Tesla on your resume and your high GMAT I think the sky is the limit for you. Well scratch that the limit is how you explain away that GPA as it really stands out as an outlier on your otherwise stellar application. If you can put together a good story that explains the disconnect between your GPA and otherwise fantastic success in other areas then you have a shot at all your schools. But the story has to be good it cant be something along the lines of I was a lazy young year old that didnt apply himself. That might be the answer but you need to find a better way to sell it. ,MBA,dgtomhw,3,t5_2rbd9
11794124,0,t3_689j47,Checking out the academics page on a schools website is helpful in identifying their specializations and teaching methods. A lot of schools list out their full curriculum and course descriptions too. So for instance if you know youre interested in Operations Management you can look and see which schools youre considering have that specialization and offer handson coursework. If youre not yet at the point of having a handful of target schools check out GMATs website.
