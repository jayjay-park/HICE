745570,0,t3_22oonm,Maybe it could work along the lines of saving a state for anything you build i.e. planned versus committed changes. Planned changes could work like any planningzoning commission and come with estimated ranges of forecast costs revenues crime etc.,Citybound,cgp10em,1,t5_30o88

996868,0,t1_chhjn75,Dragons? Are we talking about the same game? I suppose it could be some crazy mod but I dont see random groups of dragons and wizards walking about in normal life nor do I want to see them in normal mode on a city sim. Maybe I just need better eyeballs. I do like the idea of different styles occurring but I want some order rhyme and reason to them. I also wouldnt make these styles and immigrants that go along with them inherently racist. That sounds a bit nuts. ,Citybound,chhlnl4,5,t5_30o88
996977,0,t1_chhlu4w,is there a culture of fat lazy people? I think any game that incorporated this in a blatant way while not really digging in deep to social issues would become very touchy very fast and get a storm of negative attention. The city styles sounds good I think there has been mention of various styles many times plus it will be something very easy to implement in a mod if the exact style you want doesnt exist already. I made a proposal earlier that if the game was based on the resources the city runs its economy off then you will see a correlation between that and the city architecture. Examples fishing villages with bright little fishing houses forestry townships with more rustic industrial stuff and logging trucks oil cities with tacky but extravagant buildings with lots of gold and glass.  I think they style thing will never have one solid solution but mods will help everyone get what they are looking for. ,Citybound,chhm3m1,5,t5_30o88

1158952,0,t3_271dfl,I really dont like your ideas.. In my opinion the game should be focused on building and developing a city not so much on warfare diplomacy invasions etc.. Just my opinion..,Citybound,ci0009p,1,t5_30o88

1322494,0,t1_cii9y7a,Thanks for your feedback uBigTunaTim uEckhartsLadder uOtviss and others! Its sad to see that early access and alphas have appearently been abused so much that its no longer clear what to expect.There isnt enough content for an alpha is almost oxymoronic in my eyes.So let me state now and in the future more exlpicitly what the purpose of the alpha will be for me. less important a way for me to ask for funding money with actually giving something in return. more important a possibility to playtest and evaluate even the first fractions of user interface and gameplay. It is impossible to implement such things perfectly without having them tested by other people. The big difference for this project is that I see no reason to do even this very early testing in private this is why there will be a public alpha so early.Regarding the exact scope of the alpha I really dont know yet. A lot can happen in one month and my goal is something that is already fun even if just for a short period of time.I will try my best to communicate my intent with this as best as possible it may even mean not calling it an alpha which is still a nerdy softare engineering term anyways but maybe use a different word like early preview.I hope this helps let me know what you think.,Citybound,ciiebgz,10,t5_30o88

2627821,0,t1_cn1dfto,I think ill agree with ThethDoc here considering the vary first post from Anzelm on his devblog which showed a generated map of .km with fully of roads at FPS despite running on a  year old gaming PC I think this itself already shows limitations already even if computer hardware has improved over the years theres still going to be a limit of how big one big city tile will get  which would certainly be bigger with hardware today. Even back then the code was probably not optimised but I still technically think theres going to be limit unless you want to give up more FPS for city size  although Im not aware about whats under hood so it could be possible but I in a way I still think weve havent got to that age yet. Agent simulation itself is pretty heavy.,Citybound,cn1lb9f,3,t5_30o88

3703785,0,t3_32t8pb,One of the interesting things mentioned in the post is that of a national heritage simulation. Things like building on green belt and demolishing older buildings is a sticking point in many residents of local areas. take HS in the UK for example. Many people protest new development and new infrastucture under the fear that it will disrupt their normal or disturb the look of the surroundings. A way to prevent certain places from being upgraded would be pretty cool  preserving your first housing estate for your entire game would be a interesting whilst other districts grow into massive skyscrapers mirroring what is felt in many upandcoming cities.Also even though buildings in this game are procedurally generated it might be cool if parameters changed along with time something that simcity  did. For example if you decided to start a game in  buildings would have less glass smoother edges and no solar panels etc. But a game progressing into  say would have floortoceiling glass and sharper edges. Only buildings zoned or upgrading would take on the look of the current architecture.,Citybound,cqegfom,6,t5_30o88

7612655,0,t3_4jfbiw,There are essentially two schools of citybuilder players. One wants a citysimulator that will present challenging gameplay and one wants a citydesigner that will allow the player to as you say build the city of his dreams. Cities Skylines in many ways excels at the latter particularly with the addition of mods and doesnt exactly fail but doesnt remotely hit the mark either at the former.No citybuilding game has captured city politics in a way that both insightfully captures and comments on reality and provides an engaging gameplay mechanic maybe the Tropico series if you allow games with such limited scope. Personally being in the citysimulator camp myself I would be impressed and enthralled with a game that managed to do it.,Citybound,d37ip4d,6,t5_30o88
10321780,0,t1_dce114x,On a more serious note the way the engine is architected now is exactly to make stuff like this possible which is both good for commercial applications like you describe and having the most epic city building game ever.Everyone wins!,Citybound,dce13zt,7,t5_30o88
10333291,0,t3_5nyfbu,I know my decisions seem weird sometimes but no to all of this. Citybound is not a game of promises. More money or attention now wont help the bottleneck was that I didnt have enough time and that it was difficult to get help from enthusiastic contributors since I kept everything closed. Both have been solved now.As the development progresses more the state of the game will be understandable to an increasingly larger audience. My efforts in marketing and PR will be in line with that and they will always be about what is much more than what will be.Given the growth of contributions just over the first couple weeks Im confident that soon I will reach an income that can fully support me.As for features and releases I have a rough idea what parts of the game depend on which other ones and what needs to be done first  trying to predict more than that is already ridiculous enough in traditional software development and even more so in a oneman unconventional project.My concept artist lives in my head and although I didnt share his work yet with you I can tell you that hes really good  rest assured that you will see his work exactly as I intend it when the game implements it and actually looks like I want.I know all of this process and my past behavior have required a lot of patience from you but I trust my intuition and principles on how to do this and they have served me well so far. I only ask you to trust me as well ,Citybound,dcfc3wz,29,t5_30o88

10796168,0,t1_ddrz637,Remember were simulating a city not a nation. While the game may charge a state amp federal tax to the residentsbusinesses that money shouldnt go into the city coffers. Id like to see a scenario where the notional upper echelon governments may offer grants from time to time if a particular set of criteria is met. Also remember personal income tax isnt the only tax which may be charged. There is sales tax property tax corporate income tax school tax to partially fund the school district etc.,Citybound,ddtjq9v,1,t5_30o88
