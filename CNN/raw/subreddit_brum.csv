Keira Knightleys husbands band was at the Hare amp Hounds in Kings Heath this week with her in tow...in the report they mentioned that Macauley Culkin and his band will be playing there sometime this summer too. It is all about a lack of interest in advertising.the problem is visitors right now have an absolutely terrible picture of the City Centre because its either a wasteand of empty shops or a building site. Theres no middle ground.What with the Palisades coming down the station half finished new builds going up around Millennium Point work about to begin on the old Library the tram tracks being laid...and if HS gets the final goahead Eastside will be a building site for the next nine years...what chance have we got?Just recently New Street Station was voted the worst in Britain despite it clearly being a building site.

803965,0,t1_cgv13d9,Its not really that bad. The train from Five Ways to University is one stop.I used to live on the corner of Rotton Park Rd and Gillott and it rarely took me  minutes to walk to Five Ways. Its not a particularly nice walk but it only takes half an hour if you get lost As another reply mentioned if you can pick up a cheap bicycle the University is only a couple of miles away. I walked from student accommodation around the University back to Rotton ParkGillott in deep snow at am in an hour. Id expect it to take a lot less time in good weather on a bike!The one problem I had with the area when I lived there which is admittedly  years ago is that it was riddled with prostitutes who used the reservoir as their place of business. I assume that in the ensuing  years theyve been moved on but I had head a few years ago that business was still booming around there.Other than that its a nice area. The public transport isnt as bad as people are makign out though. You have a circular bus route that runs at less than ten minute intervals that runs in a  mile route around the city outskirts you have a minimum six buses running to the City Centre along the Hagley Road which will take you to some nice destinations going out of town. You have three train stations well within a half hours walk including the major national hub of New Street Station.You will definitely find better placed accommodation but for what your needs seem to be its erfectly adequate and there is a lot of student accommodation around there  specifically Gillott Road and Stanmore Road if memory serves.,brum,cgvnx9p,1,t5_2rdjk

4816703,0,t1_cu0nd84,Thanks very much for the reply!That makes sense now. I hadnt realised Solihull was a borough I thought they might have just said Solihull because it is close.In terms of the commute I wouldnt want any more than  minutes if at all possible. Definitely no more than  minutes but Id be hesitant at that. To be honest though the level of traffic is more important to me. I had a job last year that took  minutes to get home from due to traffic instead of the  minutes it would normally take and it was very miserable.As for accommodation and budget a one bed flat would be ideal but I was thinking a room in a house from somewhere like spareroom.co.uk would be more realistic. If I was looking at a one bed flat I could probably go up to around . If it was a spare room I was looking maybe ish with bills included.As for the area ideally a local shop like a garage or mini supermarket with possibly a take away within about  minutes walk with a larger supermarket and possibly a few other shops like clothes shops etc kind of like a small town centre within a  minute drive. A local pub would be nice but if theres a couple in the town centre type thing Id be happy with that too.I really appreciate you talking the time to help!,brum,cu1onur,1,t5_2rdjk

They vary across the world simply because of the different living conditions so no need for facts you just look back in history and the facts are there.
