4712343,0,t3_3fgqo0,Its like a creamy banana with some vanilla in it. The banana is not overpowering its a nice mild Vape. Very delicious,slothsauce,ctoj2rd,3,t5_3903c
4712691,0,t3_3fgqo0,I was hoping to like it more than I did. Its not bad its a very nice candy banana similar to nana cream but not quite the same nana cream has some other fruity weirdness going on in it and the creamyness is more pronounced with a strong vanilla wafer taste going on near the end. When you vape it a bunch the banana tends to fade and you get more of the vanilla wafery custard taste. I give it props for how much it ends up tasting like the cookie theres a strong hint of pastry and i think i taste a lil cinnamon but in the end its not for me.,slothsauce,ctoknnt,3,t5_3903c
