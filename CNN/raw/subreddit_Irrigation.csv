793469,0,t1_cguc1te,You dont necessarily have to twist the wires together. Twisting on the wire nut will do that for you. It screws on like a bottle cap. You will want to waterproof the wire nut with something. It may be easiest to get a waterproof splice at a hardware store. Its just a wire nut filled with a greaselike substance like this,Irrigation,cgugysj,2,t5_2s3gr
3851446,0,t3_34j4ol,Id take out all of the soaker hose and put in actual drip irrigation. With regulated pressure you can expect nearly the exact same amount of water from the first emitter and the last depending on how long the run is. How long is your run from beginning to end? Whats your water source size? What drip line do you have now?,Irrigation,cqvatcz,2,t5_2s3gr

11668268,0,t3_64dbop,You CAN mix sprays and drip on the same zone especially in a small area like that. You can get drip with all sorts of emitters. We use drip tubing that uses . gallon per hour a fraction of the gph mentioned below and you can go as low as .gph. The precipitation rate is the key. Standard spray heads have a PR of about . per hour. With most of the drip we use with  row spacing and  emitter spacing has PR of about  per hour. Math tells us that if we put the rows closer together we can increase the PR to more closely match the spray heads. Like I said earlier for a small bed go for it. Use tubing with either . or .gph emitters and youll be fine. You may have an issue finding just a few feet of drip for sale. ,Irrigation,dgim3sg,1,t5_2s3gr
