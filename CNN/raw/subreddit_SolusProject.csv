It can be run from the terminal using qpaeq but the packaging is missing a runtime dependency on pythonqt and then still has an error There was an error connecting to pulseaudio please make sure you have the pulseaudio dbus module loaded exiting... uufeedead can hopefully fix this one up for us.,SolusProject,d3dn2rn,2,t5_37o2f

10351426,0,t1_dc5ixyy,oh malware is certainly a thing if you look at whats listed in CVEs amp changelogs any image that gets decoded to create a thumbnail in the file manager or to load in the browser can be a threatnot that a a regular AV can solve this the whole kernel amp root system has to be its own AVedit its web browsing amp media playing or media backend components that are the biggest problems that bypass all the safe practices of using official packages,SolusProject,dche7hg,1,t5_37o2f

10455062,0,t1_dcmoh71,I was really hoping this would work. Completely forgot about using the network manager!Unfortunately I imported the file and checked to make sure all settings were correct. Enabled it and the same issue occurred. I messed around with IPv DNS settings to no avail. I dont know why it wont allow me to access the internetthe exact same config file works on my other computer... very frustrating!Thanks for your help though. I will use the network manager on my computer that works with openvpn.EDIT Working now! I dont know what happened but all of a sudden it started connecting. I forgot to turn off the VPN connection and within a few minutes I searched for something on google and it came back in Dutch... confirmed on ipchicken... Thanks for your help. Must have been a setting that the network manager configured correctly... idk but it works so thanks!,SolusProject,dct6p8p,1,t5_37o2f
