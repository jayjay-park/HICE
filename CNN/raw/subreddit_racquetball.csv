3316841,0,t3_2y1ae5,Really any sporting glove will work except a boxing glove or baseball glove but that should be obvious.  One guy I play with uses batting gloves used to know a guy who used receiving gloves.  I use dedicated racquetball gloves but any leather cover should work.  I also play at a rec center which doesnt get swept often enough so one guy uses sailing shoes for the antislip grip.,racquetball,cp6cj5j,1,t5_2rl6u

3900612,0,t1_cr0um1x,Yep. And AampM Rice and few other schools in the region have active club teams that regularly play against one another and theres actually a club racquetball league that sponsors tournaments around here. I cant believe that in a school of k students I cant find  high Clevel or above players that want to get in on this. But it is what it is. ,racquetball,cr0wjzh,1,t5_2rl6u
5071673,0,t1_cuxbpfm,I was talking about the head hades the newest model.I played with the head intelligence for years I just bought this yesterday to replace it actually I always thought the intelligence was balanced but that website lists it as being  points head heavy. I was surprised. ,racquetball,cuxbu61,1,t5_2rl6u
5087334,0,t1_cuxbu61,Hmmm. Says on their site that the submission is  pts. head heavy too. But still the submission seems to have more weight in the head to me. I was using my submission as my backup and intelligence as main. Either way I enjoy both.,racquetball,cuz7su5,1,t5_2rl6u

I now play with a GB Gearbox like the fellow below me and it is a hell of a stick. Definitely my new favorite since upgrading from the intelligence.,racquetball,cxdtms9,1,t5_2rl6u
5919846,0,t3_3wbb4c,I can completely relate. Started out playing at a club with  courts that were almost always full. Moved to a new area and my club has one court which is empty most of the time. From what I hear it used to have  ! courts back in the s. Pretty sad. At least I finally connected with some people who play regularly though only twice a week. And I drill by myself the rest of the time. So that keeps me going. But its still pretty frustrating. ,racquetball,cxvmg18,1,t5_2rl6u

8308030,0,t3_4tbi2v,In the s Cal had the only squash team on the west coast but won multiple Div IIIII titles and was a strong influence in future expansion of collegiate court sports teams on the West Coast.  Today Cal could have that same influence in helping racquetball or handball.  The decision makers need to look at the historical ebb and flow of these teams before making harsh irreparable decisions just because of the present state of things.,racquetball,d5g26hi,1,t5_2rl6u

11364518,0,t1_dfk52aa,The twopoint machines are best for racquetball frames and a crankstyle tension system is so much nicer than dropweight or electric.The Prince Neos  is a great machine that you can find used for around your budget.  You wont regret it...Make sure you pick up a tension calibrator too.,racquetball,dfk5ab5,1,t5_2rl6u
