Procrastinate it as much as possible eventually shell end up asking you why the two of you arent dating at that point you kindly explain to her how much of an amazing wonderful girl she his but that you dont like the concept of dating and think people shouldnt have ownership of other human beings.You shouldnt worry about it at all until she brings it up to you. If you REALLY want to drive the point home and be proactive about not creating a relationship dont reciprocate her cute names.EX. good night cutie I cant wait until tomorrow to see you! good nightI cant wait to see you tomorrow youre such an awesome guy Thanks yyou tooEdit Broseidon is it wierd if I really want to see a picture of what you look like in real life? no homo,highseddit,cggx4yd,1,t5_2sek8

992747,0,t3_25h731,You cant force her to interested in you. Based of what youre saying you seem heavily invested in this girl. If people believe that you are both flirting then I would assume that the attraction is visible. Continue talking to her but avoid being one of the many floaters which she seems to have. Also you might not know if the the time passed will pass or will ever come. You have to ask when you want tobut not avoiding asking because of fear. We often make excuses and never actually take action. We men often wait for the perfect time which never comes. In addition we cant answer most of these questions without experiencing. Therefore youre probably the most qualified to answer these questions and to decide when the time is right.,highseddit,chh4s7w,3,t5_2sek8
1083677,0,t1_chr6lif,It wasnt so much that they didnt talk to me afterwords but throughout the whole time since summer Anielle had always been harsh toward me. I just didnt understand why. Id consider us a little but more than acquaintances but not quite friends. She would always try to humiliate me in front of people and always be sarcastic. She makes fun of people behind their backs and even bashed one of the guys ex. Like what the fuck?  ,highseddit,chrgstp,1,t5_2sek8
1259932,0,t3_28hnpr,Dont. Text. Her. Start a conversation from something you might say to anyone. In my case I consider myself a sneakerhead so really I just go and ask Hey you have a nice sense of style what do you think of these? Branching off of that you could say Oh you like them! Yeah im buying them anyday at X mall then im going to the movies. State movie just for the sake of it you can say you just canceled due to gymfamilyanything.Now remember your older that just makes you have more value since the way most people view high school is that oh hes older he has known more people  hes cool. Social status is very important in school and I can see why your scared if you screw up everyone will know. Dont let it get to your head its scary but itl happen but it will only impact you based on how much you care about it.Posture is important and body language is one of the main things in seduction the brain automatically has a filter friend or foe. You want to get in that friendly area. So keep your arms open so she can see your stomach take a big space and never do the contrary. The open arms show that you arent hiding anything and the occupying of space shows that you are a powerful figure. Stand up straight lt this is dire! No one likes a slouched person! And slouched associates with weak and that destroys the point of occupying space! Straight and Tall is the way to go. I also suggest going to the gym if your mad at things like me oneitis and stuff the gym helps in releasing chemicals which make you happy and not only that you get muscle! Of course you have to make it a goal to go to the gym im  and have only been going for  months  days a week and I really needed it. It got my confidence up Im building muscle and when im mad you just take it out on the weights!Netherlands right? You guys have towns and shit not loaded with thugs unlike me. If you get to go on a Date with her go for coffee. You can end or extend the date accordingly.But in the end its best you get over her. I had oneitis and I started going to the gym for her in the end I was friendzoned. I still keep going to the gym. At first my motivation was to take out all the fury I had accumulated but later I thought Fuck her! Im attractive as fuck! I work out! I dress dope! Im better than that bitch! I can get all the chicks I want! Really its all about confidence. When you see a girl at PacSun or where ever you buy clothes say something like  that probably looks good on you im sure your boyfriend would like it if she doesnt have a boyfriend congrats you have a car you can ask her out!TLDR Go for the gym get better posture and body language become confident and just get over her. SHE is going to fuck up your seddit game   ,highseddit,cibcw5r,5,t5_2sek8

1595379,0,t3_2ck2qi,I didnt exactly read all of your post but off of what I did read Id advise to stop wanting to be the fucking king of the school.

2159170,0,t3_2jmhwn,I feel like Im on the other side of this. Used to be on your side but I moved past it. First off forget about the girls right now. They arent thinking about you taking their girls. Thats crazy talk. You have to have all the great qualities in school funny likable outgoing. Whos the leader of the group? Every one has a leader who organizes hanging out and stuff. They are usually more open to people joining their social circle too. You HAVE to get on their good side. Get on everyones good side but get close with this kid. If you find out you and him dont really get along then drop it but if you two click then I would push to hang out togheter. Dont be a loser about it and say something like Yo man we should hangout sometime bro. Ask You want to do something this weekend? They might have plans or not want to just hang out with you alone so try to maybe go somewhere. Then you can say Oh yeah do you know anyone else who would want to chill?,highseddit,clea3be,3,t5_2sek8
