1434748,0,t1_civy0lq,It appears that the runlengths would never exceed  if the gradient was exactly   not proved this empirically only by observation  so the s would be an artefact of the change of gradient as it approaches the asymptote.Note that  is a quadratic surd and thus has a regular repeating continued fraction       ... meaning some regularity in the run lengths when rounding k to nearest integers. A subtly different value makes the continued fraction irregular and so where only three values would round to the same integer perhaps four might. Likewise s may become s and s s. The latter are not as obvious to see as they resemble the expected s and s.,CasualMath,ciw4ew1,1,t5_2rvax

2171218,0,t1_clepm46,Heres a far simpler example that illustrates the flaw in your reasoning.Consider the set of axioms of group theory.  We have a set G closed under a an associative binary operation.  Theres an identity element. Each element of G has a twosided inverse.  For all elements x y of G we have xy  yx. This postulate is called the Abelian postulate.Now in some alternate reality these axioms were written down by an ancient Greek named Euclid. For many years these axioms were taken as selfevident but in time mathematicians began to question the Abelian postulate. Does it follow from the others axioms? some asked? Could it even be false? Could there be a model of the other axioms in which the Abelian postulate fails? Heresy! shouted the followers of Euclid.These questions were debated over the centuries. One day a pair of great mathematicians named Riemann and Lobachevsky shocked the math world by discovering that the existence of the set of permutations on three objects under the operation of composition satisfied all the axioms of groups except that the Abelian postulate was false! A new era in mathematics was born. From then on one could study groups where the Abelian postulate was true or one could study groups where the Abelian postulate was false.Now I hope the point of my shaggy dog story is clear. If a statement is independent of a given set of axioms what that means by definition is that there is a model of the axioms where the independent statement is true and another model in which its false.Its not any deeper or more cosmic than that. Of course since in our version of reality the axioms in question were believed to be the true physical axioms governing the universe we live in the discovery of nonEuclidean geometry came as a genuine psychological shock to the world and once Einstein came along to show that the actual geometry of spacetime was indeed nonEuclidean it set off a scientific and social revolution that we are still in the midst of. One need only consider the political arguments over cultural relativism to see the profound implications of the discovery of nonEuclidean geometry far outside the fields of math and physics.But from the point of view of studying axiomatic systems the existence of geometries that satisfy the Euclidean axioms yet falsify the parallel postulate is no more mysterious than the existence of nonAbelian groups.Surely you would not make the claim that the question of the existence of nonAbelian groups is outside of math or even outside of group theory. Indeed modern set theorists study the nature of models of ZFC with CH and without with the Axiom of Determinacy and without with various large cardinal axioms and without. Hope this helped to shed some light.,CasualMath,clft9xu,2,t5_2rvax

4635974,0,t1_ctevx6u,Okay I kind of see where youre going with that. Im working this out on graph paper because  dimensions is a bit easier for me to see whats going on. Im also starting to see that maybe Im missing some information in my post.This works if I can analyze discrete points along the line and check if the distance from the point to the center of the sphere is less than the radius but for computational reasons thats not really a good idea. Im going to go back and see if I cant find the formula for seeing if it intersects at all pretty sure it ends up as a quadratic which is pretty easy.EDIT I think Im onto something...maybe...Honestly Im less worried about figuring out if it intersects but rather where on the sphere it intersects. Thats where my trouble is I think. But I appreciate any and all help I do so thanks for taking the time to write something and get me thinking in a new direction.EDIT  Okay I worked through this but got a complex number as the result for a sphere of radius  at center  and a point at  extending in the direction of  so Im assuming that means I did it wrong as Im pretty sure that ray intersects with that sphere.

Its not a  chance the dealer gets it on the second try. Sometimes the player will get their original card again making it much harder for the dealer to match a second time             represents the player repicking their original card and the dealer matching.   represents the player not picking their original card and the dealer matching.So the real answer is... still about . but slightly closer to . than your answer.,CasualMath,dacmjey,3,t5_2rvax
