99838,0,t3_1v7nlw,we need a movie with these kind of turtles and it should be rated R and they actually dismember Foot soldiers. And it should be directed by Neill Blomkamp and feature Krang,TMNT,cepsp97,4,t5_2scgh
162069,0,t3_1vxxax,The mass produced kids costumes always tend to look like crap and deform the base character into bizarre characterizations. I for one am somewhat excited in seeing some deviation from the classic belts only design that dominate almost all of the Turtles official works. We tend to enjoy upvoting stuff like this and should be excited that they may actually be taking the art in a new direction.It makes sense that our teenage heroes would individualize themselves far beyond mask color and weapon choice. Accessories are an important part of conveying ones personality and the fact that this version of Mikey is draped in numerous trinkets gives us a glimpse into his personality. Again withholding judgement until we get more to go on than leaked Walmart Halloween costumes.EDIT The more I stare at the mask the more it reminds me of this semifamous alternative take on the turtles. Id venture to guess that it looks better attached to a thicker tortoiselike neck than artificially severed to fit a mold for mass production.,TMNT,ceww4zg,7,t5_2scgh

202223,0,t1_cf1gk1p,Thats what Im saying. In the new Nick TMNT cartoon their body size and muscles are different as well as skin and shell color however they retain their slim and agile ninja physique. The new ones look too large and bulky to be ninjas they look more like an MMA fighter or WWE wrestler body style wise which is what I dont like. I think it will be hard to see these big meatheadish turtles to be ninja and actually be believable. They just seem overly muscular and not the typical functionally fit ninja physique theyve held throughout the years. ,TMNT,cf1h5o1,-1,t5_2scgh

I found  loose incomplete Scratch at a thrift store last month for just that reason.As for the rarity of Scratch and Hot Spot they are not the rarest items.  But they are two of the only figures from the basic assortment that were significantly harder to find.

2101814,0,t3_2ix0g1,Some things that stuck out to me on this episodeObviously a filler episode from the overall plot but Im also  watching a kids showThe action scenes with The Finger had a lot of comic book style whams and SMASH text effects. I believe this had something to do with how violent the series got in the last few episodes. It might be a nod to that...This episode was mainly here to get Donnie off Aprils case and just MOVE ON from the love triangle.Seth Green was in this episode? He literally had one line...Did anyone else notice the STAR badgepatch on Aprils butt toward the end? Was this a nod to Black Nerd Comedy? At this point Im ready for  TMNT series. One that gets at the nitty gritty overall plot like Krang Shredder Dimension X... and another series that can just have the Turtles doing dumb stuff with Big Foot spoof and parody type stuff.,TMNT,cl6ziqn,2,t5_2scgh
2103995,0,t1_cl6uhh3,I think you have to take in context that The Finger was voiced by Jesse Ventura.Why was he so powerful?  A nod to professional wrestling.  He hulked up against Donnie just like how Hulk Hogan would nosell the attacks of an opponent.Why did everyone refer to him as the finger?  Seems like a nod to how The Rock always refers to himself in the third person.Although filler I found this one very enjoyable.

Leonardo Donatello Raphael and Michelangelo plus it contains one issue from Microseries vol.  Splinter. You get less with the IDW collection but from what I see it costs much less. You can buy IDW collection vol.  and vol.  which is released in March for less on Amazon Vol.  contains  and many Microseries tie in issues. You will get more complete stories with the IDW collections than the box set. I originally wanted to collect the IDW hardcover collections. I think they look very cool and the stories flow much better than having to jump around. I decided to collect the trade paperbacks TPBs because they are only  months behind and the IDW collections are over  years behind. Unless you  can find a good deal on the box set dont buy it.

6943723,0,t1_d13cls0,Yeah I bought Madden  for PS a full year after it was released brand new on Amazon. The game would barely load the title screen. When I finally got through to an actual game without freezing defensive players would randomly become invisible and tackle me without me even knowing they were there. And that was if I got far enough in a game without it freezing midplay. ONE whole year after it was released and the bugs werent fixed. Luckily Amazon has an awesome return policy and I got my full refund and shipped it back. I would never preorder a game nor would I ever pay more than about  for a new game again. Its just not worth the hassle. Ill wait to see if it works then Ill wait a little more for the price drop. Thanks everyone who tests these games out on release daymonth though!

7670727,0,t3_4kc67d,I actually dont think it needs to be changed much.  But given the opportunity I would have removed  April from the scenes or at least limited her to just a single visit instead of serving as a lab assistant.  Then I would have made Splinter an actual sewer rat living in a drain line under the lab which they were using to illegally dump chemicals from the experiment after each trial.  This allows Splinter to start the mutation process earlier and ready to help the Turtles later.  He could even have watched Aprils Dad and come to admire his role as a father thus deciding to do the same when the Turtles are released.   This also explains why Splinter knows so much about the lab and SachsShredder and why neither of them seem very interested in him or his body later despite the fact that he seems to have the same mutagen in his blood as the Turtles.Within the climatic scene itself you would just have Aprils Dad dump the Turtles down the drain as the first step in destroying the lab and records.  That makes far more sense than April being there in the fire to rescue them yet not seeing her father get shot.  Splinter collects them up and decides to be a father to them in honor of Mr. ONeil.Taking April out of the lab as a child would also give you a chance to actually demonstrate her skills as an investigative reporter.  Naturally now that she has grown up one of the things she is looking into is how her father died.  She could still have her fathers notes from home and thus connect the names from the files to the names used by the Turtles.  And Splinter and the Turtles still have the same reasoning to be indebted to her as in the script only now it is on behalf of her father who set them free and saved them.,TMNT,d3e48fg,2,t5_2scgh
