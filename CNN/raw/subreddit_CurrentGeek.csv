11328227,0,t1_df344to,Just saw that our video was posted here on Reddit!  I am the Project Director for JoyceStick and a student at Boston College.  To answer your questions we will be accomplishing two things in this project In our sandbox environment you will be able to freely interact with the objects found throughout the novel which will help in understanding major themes symbolism historical relevance and more and In our gameplay and story driven part we will be taking you through the most significant parts of the novel.  This is where our creative ideas really get to shine in the gamification the novel.  These scenes can be abstract and more literal with regard to the actual text.  However every scene will aim to evoke emotion create atmosphere and have the user gain further knowledge from the novel in this new kind of learning.We are currently trying to increase our public presence and starting to publish our processes and ideas.  Here are some additional resources to help you learn more about our projectIf you have any other questions feel free to reach out to me!,CurrentGeek,dfg1alg,1,t5_2zh2a
