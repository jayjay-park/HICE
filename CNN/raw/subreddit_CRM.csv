And I had no better business than to review one more piece of software.I did not quite implement Insightly but did advice a couple of friends to start using the software. A few stuck with Excel sheets and a couple of adventurous guys moved to ERP side of things that offered a CRM module.,CRM,ct8smun,1,t5_2qs9e
8849420,0,t3_51fbnt,Im assuming that if youre looking at Dynamics its because you want to be integrated with your ERP and customer info. When youre in that class of product theyre all the same functionally including Sage CRM. Theyre not nearly as intuitive as some of the sleek standalone products but having all of your systems integrated seamlessly without a rd party is an important tradeoff. Dynamics CRM is a reputable product and a good fit for SMBs. It lacks some marketing features but can be integrated with other platforms like HubSpot or Mailchimp.However if youre not already using a Dynamics ERP product or have no intention of doing so I would look at another product. Preferably something cloudbased. ,CRM,d7bkp1o,2,t5_2qs9e
