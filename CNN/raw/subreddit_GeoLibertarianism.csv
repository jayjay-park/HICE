4894276,0,t3_30ntk6,I dont think the Feds should own as much land as they do in Nevada but at the end of the day Clive broke the law and law enforcement took action and upon that actions hundreds of armed jackasses came in and made the situation far worse than it needed to be. ,GeoLibertarianism,cubgo2y,1,t5_2swkn
6013729,0,t3_3xumdh,Geolibs dont say that some land is too much or too little.  You are free to own as much as you want so long as you are willing to pay the land value tax on it as means of gaining the right to exclude others from it.,GeoLibertarianism,cy7xetb,3,t5_2swkn
7621635,0,t3_4gmmo5,I came to geoism from ancap as well.  The transformation of my thinking began thus if a landowner under ancap is basically the monarch of a very small kingdom then what happens when a landowner has a huge amount?  Isnt he then just a monarch?,GeoLibertarianism,d38jg70,1,t5_2swkn

8865295,0,t3_50w40p,They definitely had geolibertarian ideas. See Lockean proviso and Agrarian Justice.You can also find geolibertarian ideas in the writings of Adam Smith David Ricardo Thomas Jefferson James Mill John Stuart Mill Herbert Spencer and Thomas Spence. This people would probably go on to influence Henry George.I mean they at least believed that everyone is entitled to access land not necessarily that tax rent should be collected and distributed.Given how widespread the idea was and considering the claims that Progress and Poverty was one of the best selling books on economics ever it is hard to understand how georgism is not as known as capitalism communism socialism or other politicaleconomic theories.,GeoLibertarianism,d7dhfkp,2,t5_2swkn
9236733,0,t3_50w40p,John Locke transcends his own proviso by saying that the social effects of land ownership increase the common stock of mankind. So while he likely supported land value taxation he wasnt a fullblown Georgist.,GeoLibertarianism,d8mtnwq,1,t5_2swkn
