10659889,0,t1_ddff7ir,Ive always liked Cody especially after listening to it multiple times. It just feels to me like a much chiller album in a good way. And I like how the variety keeps the album fresh to listen to. Not quite my favorite joyce album that would be NHA but its still a great album imo.,joycemanor,ddfhipa,1,t5_2xnih
