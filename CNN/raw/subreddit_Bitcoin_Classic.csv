6262728,0,t1_cz1hjxe,Modification of number  we could try to find tangible benefits to Seg wit compatible transaction types to encourage their use.Faster transaction propagation lower fee thresholds priority inclusion in blocks etc.SegWit could be included as a hard fork as a beta transaction type and nobody pressured to use it but then incentives added via soft forks down the road.If its solid and has network or utility benefits to users encouraging its use with incentives and the utility it provides will get most people using it. If the day ever occurs where almost everyone uses it instead of the old transaction types we could discuss removing the legacy transaction types.,Bitcoin_Classic,cz1i3qh,1,t5_3bq6m

6347309,0,t3_42k9cu,Michael did certainly not have any authority to speak for the Classic project and does not represent it in any way. The fact that he was involved early on does not change that. He assisted us in setting up consider.it and thats it. He obviously went overboard in claiming auhority over anything. Our stance has been from the beginning that the only focus is MB now and governance can be decided on later. Having MB happen will help enable open competition between different clients which is much more important.,Bitcoin_Classic,czb49t3,7,t5_3bq6m
6366216,0,t1_czcg4yx,The other side is people like me who are into Bitcoin?Please be advised that the other side of Bitcoin is banks and governments and no i do not intend to join your side and that I am honest and open about that.I am basically here because I try to understand why you guys are trying to fuck up Bitcoin. But to be honest when reading through all the madness here I dont care anymore and this is yet another failed attempt anyways.But thank you for trying to explain!,Bitcoin_Classic,czd9ol0,0,t5_3bq6m

6580372,0,t1_czzfihi,Thanks I fixed it. It had been looking for the old Bitcoin Classic block version number. I changed it to the new version number and now it is displaying correctly. It was just a single number needing to be changed as it often is in programming,Bitcoin_Classic,czzypyy,1,t5_3bq6m

Im guessing its CProgram FilesBitcoinClassicbinbitcoind.exeSince there is a space in the path you might need to quote the path use the autocompleation feature of run or cmd to get the correct path.,Bitcoin_Classic,d072pvc,4,t5_3bq6m

6972248,0,t3_4b5osa,Git needs to have the one we host on github available. So make sure that you cloned it from the right URL at first by running    git remote vwhich should show you the github url If you dont have that I strongly suggest just removing your bitcoin dir and doing a new clone.Afterwards whenever you want do a     git fetch all tagsafter which you can do the checkout you want.You should be able to compile and run the . branch as that is the stable branch whereas the develop branch is where all the good stuff happens but that may kill kittens so be careful running develop!,Bitcoin_Classic,d16n3u3,1,t5_3bq6m

7208331,0,t1_d1xiees,Oh growth having stopped due to a lack of capacity is now proof that onchain scaling is not as urgent as a lot of people initially believed huh?I mean on a technical level youre not wrong all markets are selflimiting and when capacity stops growing so will adoption. I guess it really depends on what your ambitions for bitcoin were in the first place. Some of us actually wanted a revolution of money silly us.But youre right a nice toy of sorts with highly collectible tokens that arent good for much else than rarity is certainly a success for some peoples definition of  success.One question though a very simple one that nobody has been able to answer all throughout this matter what evidence have you that was went on during the fee events were spam attacks? And how exactly would you differentiate a  spam transaction from a real one given that they both pay fees that go towards the securers of the network. What plan would you propose to amonitor and identify and b get rid of said spam tramsactions?,Bitcoin_Classic,d1xj3sa,2,t5_3bq6m
