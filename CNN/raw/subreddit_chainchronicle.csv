Currently we have Orca and a few other  star arcana but Id like to focus on her as she has excellent stats and even boosts the damage of other knights and soldiers on the battle field later in the game! If youre interested in having her or one of the other featured ones heres a guide on how to reroll your account... Once you have that initial free roll out of the way heres a guide on helping you evaluate your mid tier arcana the  star ones This indetail list will off become quickly outdated possibly as we just had some additions to the game content a few days ago and lets not forget our mods have placed an arcana spreadsheet in the side bar that will allow you to compare your arcana in question with others similar to it. the weekly discussion post on the front page might be a good place to show off your current arcana to other  players as they may be able to give you other opinions aside from my own options are always good!

5704900,0,t3_3t73pq,I think the biggest reason might be that its not breaking the game as of yet.  If my experiences with Brave Frontier are any indication Gumi isnt exactly very good at planning ahead with their games  even now many of the exclusive units they release not only dominate the top of the meta but in some cases have actually completely changed the meta and in one case caused a gamebreaking glitch Look up Hadarons Stealth to learn more.  However that being said whos to say they arent going to fix it...?  We already saw them increase the difficulty of a Demon Raid compared to its JP Counterpart whos to say that they wont do the same with future Demon Raids andor the Tower Events?  Its already been widely known that to truly succeed at the Tower Events you either need the event units or a truly obscene amount of stamina fruits.  If Gumi knows that a large amount of the player base utilized this exploit to get massive amounts of resources whats to stop them from planning around that?  Even if they fixed the exploit now those resources were still legally obtained the only right theyd have to remove them would be if the player used some kind of botting software to automate the process.  For all we know we might see some inflation in Fortune Ring prices in the future on top of a possible increase in event difficulty to get people burning all those newly acquired stamina fruits.That or Gumi will hopefully remain blissfully unaware of things and we can spend the next year or so MLBing every Ring Gacha Character that comes out.,chainchronicle,cx48ycl,2,t5_337u5

5852584,0,t1_cxmiwr4,Okay i can see whats going on. Im not going to say anything in a condescending way because it genuinely looks like youre trying. So here are a lot of things you can fix Always keep Auto on. You have way too much wasted time on your units. Half the time your Deed isnt doing anything so its like youre short a unit. With auto on your units will automatically move forward and you can simply micro manage the units you need to.  Dont use your healer to attack. Like seriously thats weird man. You sent Marina out a lot esp in earlier waves. Why? She can sit back and heal THREE people instead of attacking  person. She should never move from the middle left square until the big golem pushes in maybe then you can move her back a bit trying to heal all your guys all the time. Rotate your tanks. You tend to let one unit take all of the beating then spend mana to heal it up. Why not just rotate tanks and let Marina heal  at once? When the wave ends... you have a metric crapton of HP healing per wave so you dont have to spend mana. Just make sure your units are attacking even if they arent the primary tank it looks like youre under the impression that only  melee unit can fight a golem at a time because Ive never seen all  of your Knights hitting the same target in that entire video. Sidenote if you dont know how to rotate the target that the golem is hitting with single target attacks you just have to make sure you pull a unit back long enough so the golem starts hitting a fresher unit with more HP then send that low HP knight back in Focus Fire. You have a really weird spread of units going on like some units are sitting in the back or theyre all hitting different targets. This is especially prominent in the last wave. You had your ranged character hitting the main golem ??? and you split up your two knights to hit the side lanes. Kill the smaller units first since theyl get erased asap before moving onto the biggertankier ones. Prioritize Healers gt Small Golems gt Big Golems.Heres how you should have done it on the last waveSend a knight to stalltank middlebot lanes. Can be Lephret if youre bad at micro since she cant get dazed and takes less damage or Deed if youre good enought to kite which is kinda easy with auto on you just move her back to a front square on your side when the golems about to attack shel dodge it and run back to attack on her own. Make sure they stay within heal distance so let the golem walk forward if you have to but hel likely just tackle his way forward.Then leave Hatifas in the top lane and send your other two knights to beat on the same top lane unit. That golem should go down in half in a heartbeat. Then send those units to beat on the upcoming dancer. After that dancer is dead it should be dead long before the bottom dancer ever spawns. It takes exactly  hits to kill which  or  units can easily pull off before hit ever heals pull those two knights back and send them bottom  Hatifas. Kill that golem then the dancer.Then youre on to the easy part let all the knights beat on the middle golem and now you only have to micro Hatifas to kill suicide bombers. She should be killing them in  hits before they come close to your knights.Continue pulling back knights to switch the aggro of the main boss so he does damage evenly to all units. Heal with Marinas special when theyre all sufficiently damaged. If you have spare blue mana use them in a way that gives invincibility to one of your units when theyre going to get hit or tackled or to knock back the golem to prevent his tackle completely. Ideally youd be using Lephrets abilities although Parchelle is fine too but your Marina should be sustaing your group pretty well already.But seriously half your units arent doing anything most of the time. Turn on that Auto dude. And use your healer as a healer... you were doing some seriously weird stuff with Marina.,chainchronicle,cxmsvn9,1,t5_337u5

6204055,0,t1_cytww7u,On the bright side for the cost standpoint this game should make them a considerable amount of money. They dont need to do any exclusive events or anything though they are for whatever reason and could just directly port translated content from the other versions. They also run few enough games that are popular enough for them to keep it running. The other game you mentioned was developed by Zynga who arent exactly known for being amazing with all the games they create and run. Hopefully this is just left over from Holiday downtime and possibly working on new content. Id rather them take a break and throw filler events like this and then get an actual game update than get slightly more exciting but still effectively filler events.,chainchronicle,cyuu2oe,1,t5_337u5
