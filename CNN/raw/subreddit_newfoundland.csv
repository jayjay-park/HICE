103111,0,t3_1uzjep,Quick note when shooting snow amp ice.   The high reflection from the white colour fools the auto exposure system on your camera into thinking the scene is brighter than it really is. The result of this is the camera will habitually underexpose the image leading to that sort of grey colour youre seeing here.   When shooting snow its best to push your exposure compensation control to the right. Over expose the photo and youll get much more natural looking snow. ,newfoundland,ceq65dz,2,t5_2qzqt
251928,0,t3_1ws0nw,Assuming youre coming in from Nova Scotia there are two ferries that run from North Sydney to either Port Aux Basques which is on the far west side of the island usually an  hour ride for me or Argentia which is on the far east side  hours or so.  All the ferries are nice seas are usually calm.  If I had to suggest a route I would go to Port Aux Basques and travel the island.

Thats going quite well. What in the almighty fuck is going on to replace the PC Leader here in Newfoundland? Havent two of the people been more or less chosen step back from doing it from scandals? As for criminal scum well yeah. Im a pot smoker and my two dealers previously were surbuban white guys. We lived together they sold on the side specifically to their friends to help with their expenses and that was all great. But Ive had to go back to my older dealer whos not the most stable of guys.

Its a pretty much the best music venue in the city good acoustics generally good bands etc. Prices are what youd expect from George St when there are no specials on. The crowd completely depends on the show on that particular night. You can kinda guess if the crowd will be goodshitty and largesmall based on the band.  Decent capacity second largest on the street I think next to club one but a good show can still sell out so if you expect that get tickets in advance. Generally my favourite bar on the street. I might sound biased because I worked there but I got the job because I was there enough to get to know the staff at the time.Edit regarding the lay out it depends on the show.

If a developer buys a property and knows heshe can end up making a butt load of money from it theyll go for it and who can blame them.I know that the family that lived there paid small fortunes each year in taxes and was put on to the heritage property list without their consent. As far as taxes go sure it may have helped but they could afford to live there so it wasnt the final factor for them to move. If you can afford to heat that home you can pay the tax.I truly believe that if we do want to keep true to our heritage and save these excellence pieces of history we must all band together private citizens real estate companies and the city to not just figure out what the best monetary solution will be but also a long term historical vision of what this province should be.But again unfortunately money talks and bullsht walks.

7879167,1,t1_d41nirr,Exactly the problem that people put down ideas. When it comes to weaknesses we need to fix the ones we can and the ones we cant? Well they can be turned into a strength. For example were an Island geographically isolated etc. Okay so we are further away from North American markets but we have a slight advantage for European Trade. Its hard to break old habits. Thats exactly the problem I have. Resource wise we went full throttle into Oil and never considered diversifying the economy. Look where we are now. Muskrat Falls wasnt a good idea to get involved with but now were too far in the quit. These are mistakes of the past. That does not mean we cant get ahead. I have lots of economic ideas despite being young. We need to take some money and invest in the economy. Newfoundland isnt a very developed place we havent done much with our resources. Thats a big problem. Im not saying its easy to fix. Im saying it can be fixed but we arent taking the right path to fix it.,newfoundland,d41owj2,3,t5_2qzqt

The pace of life is so much nicer youre never more than a  minute drive from breathtaking scenery and the weather beats the hell out of Ontario. Newfoundlanders will tell you how terrible the weather is but dont believe it. You know those July days when you get out of the shower and its so humid that you cant get dry? I know you do. Doesnt happen here. Humidity is pretty much nonexistent here. Newfoundlanders will tell you different but they have no idea what humidity actually feels like. In the winter we do get a fair bit of snow but it just never gets really cold. Our average winter low is about minus .One thing I will say the roads are terrible. We have studded tires here and they tear the shit out of the roads. And potholes? Oh my son have we got potholes!Anyhow the long and the short of it is that I would strongly encourage you to do it.

Im not sure if you went to university or not but anecdotal means evidence based on hearsay rather than hard facts. In plain English its the exception rather than the norm. Also if you look up the definition of culture in the dictionary and apply it with the word rape it would mean that society would accept that rape is permissible. Clearly not. We have laws that do not allow rape and society views it as a highly disgusting act.Ive had my car broken into twice before. Does that mean Newfoundland and Canada have a robbery culture? Do you see how your argument lacks any substance or merit?gt  please educate me assumed white cis male...please mansplain my own lived experience of rape culture right here in both rural and urban nlWhile I am a male last time I checked people are entitled to an opinion in this great country including those who disagree with said opinion.

9378247,0,t1_d94qgjd,Well Im thinking if I can source a good deal of the entertainment from the Arts department at the university then Id be able to leverage school spirit and whatnot and appeal to university students as well as those who wish to support local markets and students.  Accompanied by affordable but classy food and drink some aggressive marketting and good timing with dramatic productions as to not conflict with popular sports I believe that this cabaret could be a hit across a very large demographic.  Perhaps annual shows such as A Christmas Carol at Christmas to be very cliche could be considered to increase income during certain times of the year.  Also nonexistant covers until a certain time before any performances and higher covers after performances begin and a percentage of revenue during the time of the performance would go to the performers.Dont really know where to start with consumer surveys.

These mental health factors are probably my biggest hurdle stopping me from packing up today.If you need medical attention for any of the issues above I can tell you from experience that you will have difficulty outside the province. I have friends with anxiety and depression who have moved to NS and Toronto only to find that medical help is harder to get due to the higher populations. It wasnt after I left that I kinda had to think to myself Do I want to have a good job in a place I hate or a job I hate in a place I love.

9746283,0,t3_5epa5u,Welcome to Newfoundland! Im guessing youre going to be working at the specialist centre on Topsail Road. If so Topsail is one of the main thoroughfares for the metro area so snow clearing there is usually pretty good. Mount Pearl is a separate city adjacent to the City of St. Johns and usually has better snow clearing.One thing about St. Johns is that when it snows its rarely just snow. Winters here hover around the freezing mark so snow usually means snow sleet freezing rain and regular rain. Roads can get pretty icy  its not the snow you have to worry about its the slick roads. Studded tires are good to have though not strictly necessary.  Looking for rentals kijiji and nlclassifieds.com are the two main websites around here. ,newfoundland,daefx19,2,t5_2qzqt

11530753,0,t1_dg2zqjk,You really ought to consult with a lawyer on this to get the title properly done. Id be curious to see the application that Crown Lands ran off  why they would have an application alone instead of a grant to the land at issue seems weird. If they never granted it itd still be Crown Lands although Crown Lands wont touch it in terms of granting it out if theres any indication of a private claim. The problem with a lot of the rural areas around St. Johns CBS PCSP Torbay etc. is that you have the questionable title you see in rural NL combined with the population explosion and land value increases weve seen in the city. This sounds a lot like that sort of situation  it might be a bald assertion of ownership of the land by Dawe which is founded on nothing but Dawe saying he owned it.Also the limitations period only starts to run on the property youre possessing from the date you take possession. So it would be ten years from whenever you make a move on the pieshaped piece not four years from today. And also if this is ungranted land youll never get clear title short of a quieting since adverse possession of Crown Lands was abolished in the s. ,newfoundland,dg30h4m,4,t5_2qzqt
