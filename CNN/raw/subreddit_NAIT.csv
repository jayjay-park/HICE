8945083,0,t3_52sqfo,Ok. This is what I did from wireless systems engineering tech to electrical engineering at u of a. You probably wont get much credit any if at all because they told me even if a minor concept isnt covered at NAIT then you have to retake the class. You could always contact any academic institution that you are looking into to see what the transfer policy is. My program was too new to do a bridging program in bc but I know a few people who went this route and it seems like most of their course work transferred. Now the difficulty of the engineering program at the u of a is steeper than that if naits programs. If you want any more questions answered feel free to ask. ,NAIT,d7n2f82,1,t5_2spah
