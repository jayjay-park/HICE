6134289,0,t3_3zd80d,If youre able to get on the internet you should be able to get a google voice number or some similar online phone service. Google voice will require you to have a cell phone to get set up but then it doesnt matter. So I would suggest buying a  trac phone or something and just using that to get your google number set up.,basicneeds,cymwkb0,1,t5_2xcyl
