477394,0,t1_cftw81a,Thank you so much for your reply. I am trying to demonstrate through my paper that restrictions on the press most likely lead a country into destabilization rather than stabilization. I am only in the beginning of my research so I cant say for sure that this is true but Im hoping it is! Im hoping to give people in power a good reason  beyond ideology or morality  for supporting a free press. Is it possible that there is a lack of a strong independent journalism presence in Ecuador which makes it easy for the press to become a mouthpiece for either the oligarchs or government? Im just thinking out loud but maybe Ecuadors journalistic culture lacks a robust sense of purpose which lends it to being overtaken by whoever gives the strongest incentive. Thanks for all the great thoughts!,ecuador,cfuj6jt,1,t5_2reu8

3377536,0,t3_2yuxrf,The communications law is a tricky one. At the end of the interview she talks about being honest and fair and there is nothing to fear... but Bonils cartoon was VERY honest and fair... it was criticizing the fact that the poor footballer aint all that poor earning kmonth times the minimum wage. And it basically emphasized that as an assembleistaSenator  hes illiteratehe couldnt read the speech that someone handed him the the national assembly. The funniest part... the lawyer representing him infront of SUPERCOM was almost as illiterate. Dude was fined for attacking the political party in power. Its that simple. ,ecuador,cpd9iwh,3,t5_2reu8

8016606,0,t3_4p0kb8,Good question! Im not really sure but I assume its because purchasing accessories for your car is popular here especially if they also protect the upholstery or other surfaces of a vehicle.

The elevation is significantly higher than Baos. Around  I believe. There are beautiful hikes up into the ecological reserve and  minutes further east by bus theres awesome sport climbing. Its one of my favorite day trips out of Quito. ,ecuador,ddc4ab6,2,t5_2reu8

Why cant even build monigotes about him in New Years Eve like we do with every politician without him threatening to imprision or sue people?Because theres NO free speech in here and hes a thinskinned motherfucker. ,ecuador,de0hxej,2,t5_2reu8

Only people who receive welfare is not protesting? So you think lasso is going to save the economy of Ecuador even though the whole world is going trough a harsh time lasso the one who proposed in his campaign that you are gonna be able to get drunk on Sunday the one who appealed to the lazy students who didnt want to do an exam so they could enter to a university the one that based his whole campaign on Im not correa I will give the same shitty country that never cared to apply laws. The man who wanted to bring back the mafias that ruled the country for so many years thanks to the chaos and fear they imposed. Sadly right now there is not a good candidate to replace the actual government corruption has no political view we need to change our culture for a hope of a better future and right now the only ones offering a change is the actual government.,ecuador,dg1jeq2,-8,t5_2reu8
