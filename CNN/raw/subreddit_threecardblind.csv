3626400,0,t1_cq5mhzm,To your first point Im only pointing out the discrepancy between having The Rack banned and not Shrieking Affliction considering that they serve essentially the same purpose. I dont think its choking deck diversity or anything at this point I just think it odd to have one banned and not the other.But your second point may be the more interesting one. What makes Chronomaton so good is its interaction with Cavern of Souls I can both cast it and activate it with Cavern. There is an equivalent creature to Chronomaton in White Cenns Tactician but I cant pump it up with Cavern so Im forced to expose myself to Force of Will to play it.Chronomaton also had a  conversion rate into the playoffs. It was played in four decks and all four of them won their pod. So the stats certainly back up your claim.,threecardblind,cq5mxtz,2,t5_37o6n

3630710,0,t1_cq64axd,I think youre right about the DQ but its too much work to remove and I think it was an honest mistake so Im just going to leave it. With the other corrections a DQ still leaves you first but it would lift me from third to second... ah well.For the draw its cause CBB cant pay for the OH! He can!. Then CBB wins cause Selesnya Charm exiles... Oh but TB can make an eot Avatar if CBB pays for Tabernacle. Okay youre totally right.,threecardblind,cq64ni3,1,t5_37o6n

4922455,0,t3_3ia4z0,It was too tempting to not play a turn one deck even though I knew it was vulnerable to disruption. I was hoping that more people would play Leyline of Sanctity without another piece of disruption which didnt turn out to be the case. Hats off to the people that discovered Aura Shards which is easily the card of the round. I think this round is really unique since free creatures make certain cards incredibly powerful. I dont think Cabal Therapy or Time Vault need to be banned except in formats with free creatures. Cabal Therapy isnt very good without free creatures. In fact it wasnt played at all last round. If CT and Blackmail are banned that just makes Thoughtseize awesome. I think we should just allow good turn one interaction. The Time Vault combo didnt even work very well here and its incredibly fragile without a free win condition.Here are my resultsAgentOfDimir WW slow beatdown is good enoughAlexTFish LL cant beat mental misstepArsIgnis WL discard beats me on the drawasilano WW no interactioncheezwhizguru LL cant beat mental misstepcmeister WL on the draw turn one karakas on the token during my upkeep followed by turn two suture priest wins the gameknockturnal WL discard beats me on the drawmetroidcomposite WL discard beats me on the drawnathanwe WW no meaningful interactionPegoudLion WWno meaningful interactionqqzm WL discard beats me on the drawthebaron WLXScorpion WLPoints   ,threecardblind,cuf0i5k,1,t5_37o6n
4922967,0,t1_cuf2g25,World Queller makes each player sacrifice.The trick is that Queller will actually choose enchantment for the first  turns making the thopters an even field. Then World Queller starts to attack threatening a trade for  thopters. Chumping every turn obviously doesnt work so the trade must be accepted after which point asilano has more thopters and will eventually win with correct play.,threecardblind,cuf2ty6,1,t5_37o6n
