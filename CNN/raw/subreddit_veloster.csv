1759073,0,t1_ck0t6vt,My turbo has automatic climate control so it adjusts the strength automatically and it blows nice and cold!  On super hot days when I park in the sun it takes a little bit to cool down but I havent had any issues with it...yet!,veloster,ck0vzvv,2,t5_2syvr

3336886,0,t3_2y9z26,Look at the r spec. People are on both sides of the fence on it but from a drivers perspective I found the trades to be worth it. The stock short shifter is wonderful and I love the red seats. Just weigh what is important to you and go from there.,veloster,cp8mplz,1,t5_2syvr
3933878,0,t3_33yflg,My experience is this  dont buy a cheap BOV.  Either go with a synapse TIAL Q or HKS not a knock off HKS.,veloster,cr4p3zh,1,t5_2syvr
4078074,0,t3_3770xx,Touchless automatic works fine. I take mine once every couple of weeks and I take it to a hand wash place once every couple months. Never had a problem. ,veloster,crl4jym,2,t5_2syvr

5431491,0,t1_cw5wmp9,I definitely enjoy my white turbo with tinted windows and blacked out rims. I actually added reflective vinyl to the calipers for a little color.  I really like that H emblem!,veloster,cw5xf8v,1,t5_2syvr

5663615,0,t3_3sm8hq,Midlife crisiser here Not sure you managed to find a brand new  VT these days but congratulations never the less. Turbo or nonturbo? Is it automatic or manual? If turbo manual the handling isnt the greatest but its not terrible either. Its very easy to overaccelerate so just be careful on icywet roads. I upgraded to  tires that are wider than the stock and it improved the handling greatly. ,veloster,cwz4kd2,1,t5_2syvr
5935563,0,t3_3wnyay,I swapped all rotors and pads on my  turbo at  miles. Rotors had warped in the back but pads were good. Front pads at about half wear. ,veloster,cxxolr5,1,t5_2syvr

6465715,0,t3_42oxq8,Im late to this party but I have a small amount of advice to give that I havent seen after skimming this thread.I like yourself wanted an RSpec and not the full Turbo. I started leasing mine  months ago and when I went to find one nobody had an RSpec within  miles so I upgraded to the flat VTurbo and Ill tell you what Im so happy I decided on getting the Turbo instead of waiting for the RSpec.Specifically as others have said the blind spots on a Veloster are fucking huge. Pair that with having limo tint in the back theres not much I can see out the back at night. I cant imagine driving a Veloster without a backup camera and the RSpec doesnt come with one.With that being said and I know that this sounds silly but the push button start found on the Turbo is just so satisfying to use.You definitely want dark tint on your Veloster it completely changes the look of the car I can get you pictures of what mine looks like with my limo tint if you want me to so you can compare.,veloster,czo3m1a,2,t5_2syvr

8689084,0,t3_4yxr2l,We dont really have a winter season here in Arizona. Its either Summer or cooler Summer. My VT seems to handle either one just the same.,veloster,d6rrhgp,3,t5_2syvr
8715436,0,t3_4z9mew,You have to fill up three times a week? You need to reassess the way youre driving if you wanna put a priority on gas mileage. I have a  base. Its different than a Turbo sure but driving miles a week in highway and stop and go I fill up once a week. If you dont wanna fill up three times a week drive more economically. ,veloster,d6v2g6j,1,t5_2syvr
9297266,0,t1_d89y30g,Hey I just installed an MBRP catback and a resonator delete. Sounds Badass! I also just ordered a catted downpipe and was going to get a CAI next. Do you really think a mm tb is going to make a huge difference? When should I get a tune? Should I get a FMIC also?  THanks for all the advice!Here is my car after I installed the exhaust,veloster,d8uhtz9,1,t5_2syvr
9339372,0,t1_d7oazmr,Late response.  Sorry. Never go there again. The quarter glass in a bolt in piece. Its held in with a few small nuts  and a ribbon sealant. There should be next to no circumstances for replacing that glass. Even if it needed new glass  its not special order... Its readily available all over or can easily be had from ebay or any other used outlet for under . Should require no more than . hours Labour. ,veloster,d8zu0i0,1,t5_2syvr
9339676,0,t1_d8zury4,Nope thats what came on any VT before . Looking to change that  this one is falling apart. Its actually the third knob they just dont hold up. ,veloster,d8zvear,2,t5_2syvr

9709997,0,t3_5e5viu,Yup. My solution was to say fuck it tear out the back seats flatboard the rear weld in a rollcage and transport the boy in a different car. Veloster is pretend racecar now. ,veloster,da9ys7u,7,t5_2syvr

10615359,0,t1_dd9r083,Cool.  No worries Ive heard plenty of muffler delete clips on Veloster forums.  They sound decent but they dont show if it drones or not.  Glad to hear you dont have that problem.,veloster,ddaw71d,1,t5_2syvr
