8093,0,t1_cefcjvw,I grew up like you in a very conservative church. To think of meditation as devil worship is what youve been told not the truth. The purpose is to learn your own mind. Buddhism has no object of worship remember that. Think of it as training like you would train for a marathon. You are excersizing your self control as you sit not moving. See how long you can go with all your itches thoughts pains and distractions and then apply the same technique to your desires. Think of your mind as a clear water bottle filed with dirty water. Every time you do something that increases your desire you lose your temper get frustrated or something goes wrong its like the bottle gets shaken. You cant see through muddy water right though he can play the blues? But when you meditate it allows the dirt and mud to settle to the bottom. The more and longer you sit the better the dirt settles. As the dirt settles youll find things dont bother you as much and you find its easier to cut your desires off early before they gain a lot of power. One the dirt has settled you begin to remove the dirt and then no matter how much your shaken the water isnt muddied. Remember Buddhism is Asian and not Western so things like bowing dont really mean what Westerners think they mean its just a cultural difference. Because of my Christian upbringing I felt odd about bowing when I stated but I think of it as showing respect and gratitude. I felt odd being taught by women but karma gave me nuns to learn from. All these things have shown me how my mind makes biases where they dont exist and how to lose them. Dont give up because you have your answers the funny part is learning the questions. ,Buddhism,cefcvvx,5,t5_2qhnf
8733,0,t1_ceeu7a1,The problem with that view is that there isnt nothingness after death. The same nothingness after death is the same nothingness before death and the same nothingness now. So many people have died have lived or are still to be born and nothing has ever changed. The self the person and the life all dissolve at death. But you are mistaken to identify with your self person and life. Those dont arise from within you they come from outside you. Everything that makes you you is dependent on external causes and dissolves when those causes inevitably change. So why draw the existential line at your personal self? Further there are so many other beings in the universe existing simultaneous to you. They are all at the center of their own universes so why are you even you? A more true conception of our own existence is transcendent of the individual. We dont have the cognitive faculties to directly perceive this as we physically have no sense mechanism for it. Thats the only reason. This means that in order to directly understand the consequences of our physical being we have to rely on our reasoning abilities alone. As individuals in a single slice of time were like one facet of a gigantic reflective crystal that reflects the exterior of the crystal only and cannot reflect anything within the crystal. But all individuals all facets are all simultaneously a part of the same crystal. Therefore nothing changes during birth or death that is different from what changes during your life. In fact it doesnt matter whether or not rebirth or reincarnation is true. There isnt even actually any birth or death. Just the image of birth and death as perceived by minds ignorant of their own context in the greater whole and ignorant of the true existential nature of all being. Were all cut up individuals only because we dont have a sense faculty to see beyond the surface. Even from a completely materialistic and reductionist standpoint which may be true the template of beings keep recycling. With the concept of an individual being completely obliterated there may not be a rebirth but there is more definitely a morebirth. The engine keeps on working the wheels keep on turning and the spirit or essence or nature of reality never changes.,Buddhism,ceffhui,1,t5_2qhnf

18036,0,t1_cegbrau,IIRC the buddha discovered the Jhanas on his own when he was younger by accident when walking through his local town as a child. He then went off to try to figure out the end of suffering for many years unsuccessfully trying many different systems until one day he finally remembered his experience as a youth and resought that Jhanic experience and from which he went immediately to Enlightenment. Though it is important to note that he went back into these Jhanicconcentrative experiences with the intent to understand the causes of suffering which is basically a fusing of Insight and Concentration practice which would indeed lead to enlightenment. Meditation and Yogic practices as techniques do not originate from one particular place while there is a predominance in India and that region of the world these spiritual techniques can literally be found in every culture dating back to the earliest times of man. The early sumerians the chinese aboriginies native americans etc. Some speculate that the origin of these practices could have been introduced by some outside source such as extraterrestrials but we will never really know.,Buddhism,ceghj36,1,t5_2qhnf

Here is the definition of cult from the Websters dictionary a small religious group that is not part of a larger and more accepted religion and that has beliefs regarded by many people as extreme or dangerous. Is the SGI part of a larger and more accepted religion? Yes Nichiren Buddhism or just Buddhism. What beliefs do they have which are extreme and dangerous? Universal Buddhahood? World peace? The Lotus Sutra? Considering themselves like most Buddhist schools to be the best school? The SGI is a flawed organization that is overzealous in what it does and is blind to its own idealization of its leaders but lets be real thats a problem with a lot of religions.

Im sure there are many things youre working on or trying to adjust in your life. For now for your health make smoking the priority. Today you dont smoke.

I was Christian before I became Buddhist and saw between the indoctrination that it has endemic to it. Much of the insight I gleaned though from Christianity was between the lines and its often have to delineate between the religiosity and the actual teachings. Overtime I realized that the barriers were only man made and great religions at their root including Christianity Islam and Buddhism all have key teachings that overlap quite a great deal. I totally see beyond the noise. Buddhism is something that has been kept fine but after  years many variations of true Dharma exist as mistranslations and misunderstandings sometimes exist. For any seeker of the truth a critical thinking faculty is important that includes being able to see things as they really are and this too is an important teaching of the Buddha.

So this concept is a concept of something without concept which you can only know if you know the thing itself. Everything else is a description and descriptions have to be in relation to something else. It was tall it was short it was old it was young it was good it was bad it was dark it was light. Not in relation to anything but the entirety of it.Buddhas a title a description too. It can mean enlightened or awake. So if you see the entirety of this thing without ignorance of one thing to distinguish another thing just the entirety of this thing you are looking at through practice and following the path you become awake. Aware you see you know. Not the concept but the thing itself.Its important to be aware of this because despite our advancement we still use a conceptual language live in a mostly conceptual world and many of us desire conceptual happenings without seeing things as they are.

267619,0,t3_1x6ckm,There was a monk who went to India for the first time. He hired a guide to show him around the holy places where Buddha had lived. On his way he met so many poor homeless children that kept begging him for money. However the guide warned him not to give them anything as they will keep stalking him and just ask for more. The monk overwhelmed by his emotions gave in to the children and gave one of them a hand of bananas. This caused violence among the children fighting amongst themselves for a bite. He realized what he did was unfair and his actions caused more harm than it did good.Much after his trip he learned that the children were hired by local gangs to beg tourists. If he had given them money it would have ended in the hands of the very people that were taking part in the suffering of those children.The lesson here is that if you think youre doing good or you think you even know what doing good means youre already wrong.,Buddhism,cf8hysc,4,t5_2qhnf

314730,0,t3_1xntqy,My understanding is that youre attempting vippassana which is the contemplation of the impermanence of reality and existence by permanently for a time observing yourself breathing in a consistent regular fashion. This is inherently flawed. Breathing and mindfulness techniques are proscribed in order to facilitate the observation of the impermanence of reality by observing the impermanence of ones breath. If the breath is long to notice that the breath is long if the breath is short to notice that the breath is short but if the mind decides its story time notice that the mind has decided its story time. You are not cultivating the ability to standsit in a quiet room for hours on end not thinking not doing anything. You are cultivating a state of permanent awareness that is you are attempting to move from being a person who simply DOES things to being a person who observes the world and acts within in while detached from it.

329233,0,t1_cfefrci,Its my understanding that the self is based in causes and conditions and like anything that has causes and conditions with the changing of those causes and conditions the resultant self will change.For instance we may consider ourselves a particular label JoNeum ect. But through a relabeling process we might give ourselves a different label. Or we may consider ourselves deficient in some way but through a change in perspective we can see ourselves excelling in some way.Ultimately I dont think its possible to eliminate the self completely and that eliminating the self is not the goal. The goal is to end attachment and grasping. Its to end that function with respect to the self.If you see the empty nature and changeable nature of the self like any phenomena its acceptable to retain the self and use it for advantageous purposes. It would be hard to relate to the world with no sense of self whatsoever.Instead one could realize when a certain mode or aspect of self is called for and respond instantaneously as the person that is needed.Basically one can observe the ultimate nature of conventional phenomena without getting rid of the conventional phenomena itself.If we had to get rid of all objects of attachment there would be nothing left.I think trying to get the phenomena of self to disappear is impossible. I think one can only get rid of attachment.It is not the self that causes suffering but the attachment and grasping to self. ,Buddhism,cfew9m7,1,t5_2qhnf
329262,0,t1_cfef9r0,The self does not exist ultimately but it does exist conventionally. It is dependent on causes and conditions like every other phenomena though as a property of mind we have a greater control over changing those causes and conditions to make the result better or different in some ways. In this sense self can be used as a skillful means for helping and relating to others.Self is illusory like all phenomena in that it appears to exist in a way that it doesnt. But like even the illusion it does exist in subtle way. We have to see the ways self doesnt exist and the ways it does exist in order to do anything with it.To say the self doesnt exist at all is nihilistic and is to be avoided. To say it exists ultimately is essential and is to be avoided. Its somewhere in the middle there. Not inherently non exisant and not inherently existant.,Buddhism,cfewdif,2,t5_2qhnf

387030,0,t3_1ybz5m,Buddhists have always been closely associated with wealthy corporations. Anathapindika was a fabulously wealthy merchant. Who do you think paid for all those monasteries stupas and art works? Monks who were economically idle? No. Who do you think sponsors all those many books the Dalai Lama writes or his international travel retinue in train or the building of massive opulent Tibetan monasteries all over India? Tibetan refugees? Doubt it. China has several times suffered from the phenomenon of Buddhist clergy accumulating so much wealth that it had a major negative impact on the economy. The result was the sacking of monasteries and renationalising all of the wealth. Communists were certainly not the first to do so. One account of Changan in the Tang dynasty records a single donation of a billion copper coins. One could argue that Buddhism has never taken root in a society unless and until the ruling elite have adopted it. What that elite looked like may have varied from place to place but Buddhists have always allied themselves with wealth and power whatever its source. And monasteries typically become centres of wealth and power. Presumably the argument is that it is expedient upya. Its a great shame that we plaster over the cracks of our own history.

If we could backtranslate that and read in Tibetan knowing the original context wed be surprised to see that a great deal of information was stripped out in translation because for example when it says all aspects of dynamic energy of that awareness manifesting as thoughts... its actually using very specific dzogchen terminology that could use a special if initially clumsy terms to mark it.

Taking the concepts discussed I put them into practice to see if I can alleviate suffering and increase compassion amp happiness in my life.. Not true but accurate in that the conclusions I form seem to meet that goal of decreased suffering.. The Pali Canon is frequently referenced so at the very least people find it quotable. Not a universally used source though so moderate?. Sure! Its the meaning and practice that matter not the precise etymology of a word. Although I think multiple sources are important to avoid translation bias.. Try to be widely studied Ill use the Torah as my example. Scholastic literalism isnt my fav flavor but it creates some novel trends gematria for instance. Im wary of any dogma given its cultural roots rather than an objective standpoint.. . Moderately. I use many sources in an attempt to find effective common ground between the experiences of others.. Sure Im not stopping anybody and Ive yet to be stopped. Many might say theres some key points you should agree with though noble truths and all that lingo.. The universe. The beauty and intricacy of existence is admirable and worthy of respect to me nonpermanance and all that aside.. I adopt ideas that seem to improve my life and that of others. . There are too many ways to rephrase something to have a final word. Diversity is good I think opens the door for more questions. . If it was proven that the Pali Canon was contrary to my objectives Id just adopt something else for new ideas. The means and aim matter more than the label..

But my main point remains I think the bodymind model of the chakras is semiaccurate but ultimately flawed because it is derived from a combination of empirical observation and guesswork. This is much more obvious in the Western bastardized New Age reinterpretation of the model but its also true of the original yogic versions. In both cases real physical phenomena are explained by appealing to an unquantifiable and ultimately empty concept of prana which fuses breath and magic and a suposed network in the body through which this energy flows. In both cases belief in the literal truth of such a model may prove harmful. Neither version of the model is backed up by evidence.,Buddhism,cg2ng3t,1,t5_2qhnf

Freeing yourself is merely the first step in that process. As such in Theravada it is assumed that all Buddhas have left the world system and may have faint if any tangible connection to the world. In Mahayana it is assumed that they still walk among us. For this reason in Theravada there is only the most recent buddha for the most part. In Mahayana there are many since they stay around forever.Also in theravada a lot of things are left illdefined and defined more in terms of negations. Mahayana tries to actually go in depth and make sure its not just trying to pretend to say things without doing so.and so...If you ask me theravada is kind of incomplete.

706635,0,t1_cgk5ftz,gt Buddha never denied the transcendent Absolute or what would correspond to the Atman but rather consistently used anatta as an adjective for the  skandhas as a via negativa methodology toward awakening to Truth or nirvana.Excellent.gtIn other words it is true that there is nothing among the skandhas or conditioned phenomenality that can be said to be myself but that does not in turn mean there is no higher Self or ontological Absolute.In fact the Buddha actually affirmed a Self not only in the Mahayana Sutras but even in the Pali Suttas but the problem is that sometimes translations translate Atta as myself or oneself instead of Self.If we read the Suttas carefully you will notice that the Buddha limited his anatta reflection only to conditioned phenomena.  For example Bhikkhu Sujato notes that the Buddha NEVER referred to Nirvana as anatta in the Pali Suttas.Hence whey the Buddha limited his anatta reflection only to the  skandhas which are all impermanent and subject to decay and death.  The Buddha did NOT teach an absolute anatta.Further the Mahayana says the Nirvana has  qualities  permanence nicca bliss sukha purity and True Self Atta.  Which is what you get when you let go of what is anicca dukkha anatta but the problem is people have mistakenly inferred that these are the  characteristics of all existence  wrong  they are merely the  characteristics of conditioned existence.  Further this analysis on selfnot self sukhadukkha aniccanicca is also found in the Palis Patisambhidamagga where it also says that Nibbana has the qualities of nicca sukha atta.  So the Pali and the Sanskrit are in agreement.Also of note is that Ajahn Maha Boowa when you read his works is also very careful not to extend anicca dukkha anatta the tilakkhana to absolutely everything and limits it to conditioned phenomena.,Buddhism,cgklj1v,2,t5_2qhnf

863798,0,t1_ch28on7,gt I agree that the universe is beautifully complex and intricate but as a undergraduate in Biochemistry Id have to disagree with the above statement. Biological molecules are enormous collections of atoms big enough to behave predictably. Trying to predict the behavior of all the billions of molecules floating around in the cytoplasm of the average cell would require a massive futuristic amount of processing power but I dont see any reason why it would be impossible in theory.The reason is that a chaotic system is infinitely sensitive to initial conditions. Sure we can model radioactive decay as an exponential on average but predicting when a single event will happen deterministically is physically impossible. Chaos Theory combined with the Uncertainty Principle leads to nondeterminism on all scales. Even to predict the behavior statistically nondeterministically without oversimplifications the computing time scales exponentially with the number of constituent atoms in a classical computer. This is one reason people are looking for quantum computers to solve protein folding problems Thats interesting regarding free will.

871911,0,t1_ch3cxvb,Of the Four Noble Truths the third is Nirvana and the fourth is the path or cause for the attainment of Nirvana. So Nirvana is a pretty central aim in Buddhadharma.When or understanding comes mostly from reading and discussing a lot of confusion and misconception can arise. Contradictions can seem to exist where there are none in reality. Spending more time doing actual practice and relating with attained masters will put most of these apparent contradictions to rest.The problem here is that you we start from a position of ignorance. You presume that there is a something called Nirvana or a something called Paranirvana that exists and a self that exists which gets or achieves that something. Before purifying these ideas  realizing their emptiness  the discussion will always be selfcontradictory.Yes we do need to take it on faith that Nirvana is a worthwhile goal. Informed faith. We need to access wise teaching study listen pay attention take it in see how it compares with our experience use our rational faculties and test it out in practice. Through that practice we will not immediately have complete certainty but we will have enough to go on to say this teacher knows better than I do this teacher has attained it and this teacher is acting out of pure compassion for me so therefore insofar as my limited understanding sees the value of herhis teaching I will follow it and set aside doubt.Because our delusion has been constructed through many billions of instances of mistaken thought and negative action we need to hear the teaching and work with it many times before it sinks in and takes root. We cant expect to realize it upon the first hearing or first thousand hearings. For example we may understand the Four Noble Truths intellectually but its a far cry from actually seeing how they connect to our everyday everymoment lives and seeing for ourselves their absolute validity. If we really understood the Four Noble Truths there would be no backsliding  our path to Nirvana would be quick and direct.It is helpful to remember the principle of upaya  skillful means. The Buddhas teaching varied according to the understanding and accomplishment of his audience. Likewise the living Buddhadharma appears in many different forms for people of varying outlook and capacity. Those who are very attached to concepts of self and the existence of objects require a teaching where the self is used correctly and the proper objects are chosen as goals. Those who understand better the emptiness of self and objects are also taught the emptiness of Nirvana and Samsara. Time also and the notion of something happening the future is likewise empty.The higher path is not to think of yourself attaining something be it Nirvana in this life or total cessation but to instead offer yourself to practice for the sake of others. Dont make me dont make Nirvana dont make future. In my experience highlevel practitioners dont talk about these things as much as newcomers do. They focus on clarity being clear in the moment maintaining their correct relationship with the moment.

946358,0,t1_chbt7n3,Actually most of the time they publish the commentary in a separate volume or after the sutra in full if its in the same book. If the commentary is inlined with the text that means youre supposed to have another book with the standalone sutra. Theyre supposed to be read in parallel. In fact the sutra is typically recited out loud and the commentary comes in later when researching what you recited. The idea is that you read through it and then go back to dissect it. Multiple readingsrecitations is the key. I find unlocking the meaning to be a rewarding process..Another reason commentary is key is because these sutras were typically taught in person with the text being given mainly for recitation amp outlining of the major points. Relying on the text alone without the interpretation is pretty much dropping Sangha from the  Jewel equation. I believe theres an early sutra warning against presenting what needs explanationinterpretation as that which is literal and presenting that which is literal as that which needs explanationinterpretation. I dont think any of the major body of sutras Pali Nikayas Taisho Tripitaka KangyurTengyur canon are to be read straight through literally without interpretation..Im not sure I can think of a good example of contradictory ideological views on the sutras Ive spent much time with. For the sutras Ive spent a lot of time with Ive seen commentary from India from China from Vietnam and finally from Japan all present the same general ideas and come to the same final conclusions. You can definitely avoid any of these sorts of contradictions by sticking with commentaries from a single school of thought though. I guess the Lotus Sutra might be a good example of this. Thich Nhat Hanh and Nichiren might have significantly different interpretations of the Lotus Sutra so I would try to know which ideological outlook seems more in line with my own before starting out. When youre actually studying at a particular temple thats a member of a particular school of thought selecting the right commentary is almost a nonissue you just select the one endorsed by your school or just rely on your actual teachers to help you with the interpretation. Also sometimes commentaries may seem to be saying disparate things when theyre really not. Mahayana can be tricky this way because of the  truths model and different ways of looking at reality. The different ways of expressing ideas the language use of metaphor etc that they couch their explanations in can also make it tricky..I dont know too many instances of opinions showing up in the Mahayana commentaries Ive read either. East Asian Mahayana commentaries for example tend to make statements based on precedent and leave as little as possible to individual interpretation similar to the way lawyers operate. The most flagrant example of personal opinions showing up in a commentary that I can think of is actually AccessToInsight. The rant he goes on in the intro to MN  is one of the most painful examples of sectarianism Ive seen. Builds multiple straw men based on misinterpretations of the doctrines of multiple schools and proceeds to shoot them down one by one to establish his doctrinal ultimacy. If I happen to stumble across a commentary written like that I usually toss it to the side and find another one. .There are typically no shortages of good commentaries on a given sutra even multiple good commentaries in a given school. Indian commentaries tend to be the closest to the culture of the source material so if theyre available theyre definitely the ones to go for. After that the level of precedence goes to whomever was closer to the actual translators of the sutras. So in the case of East Asian Mahayana the early Chinese masters are usually a part of the doctrinal foundation. With the Tibetan canon of course its generally people like Padmasambhava Atisha Marpa and the other lineage mastersfounders. Unfortunately the older a commentary is the more likely it is to be couched in language that is not what were used to. On the flip side the more modern a commentary is the more you can be assured that doctrine has been shaped to meet modern sensibilities. I usually try to pair a sutra with one modern commentary and one traditional commentary preferably one widely quoted by later masters. It helps to keep a balance..So if I could make a suggestion read the sutra straight through chapter by chapter tackle a few pages at a time if need be. Then meditate on what that portion of the sutra is really trying to say using the commentary as a guide. Its usually pretty obvious to tell who has and has not done this based on what criticisms they level on a given MahayanaVajrayana sutra. This sutra said the Buddhas tongue can wrap around the cosmos three times what a bunch of bull! is an obvious sign that someone hasnt really put much time or thought into the interpretation of a passage.,Buddhism,chbuvrv,1,t5_2qhnf

They arent the creators of the world and theyre not to be worshipped. They are simply other beings trapped within the wheel of Samsara like humans and animals they arent transcendent in the way the Christian God is depicted.Along with the other four Buddhist realms of existence the devas and asuras can be interpreted as representing psychological states with the devas representing pride and the asuras representing envy. The Tibetan Wheel of Existence is thus not only a map of cyclical existence but also a map of the mind.

Clearly the author articulates a need of some sort of insight and mental work to be done aside from simply stilling the churning waters of the mind and so they have espoused philosophical meditation which is fine but seems lacking.  gtgtThe longing to empty the mind to calm turbulent thoughts isnt completely opposed to the exercise of cleaning up the mind decoding analysing and ordering its contents. Its just that at the moment as societies we have allowed ourselves to get overly seduced by the promise of tranquility so that we always strive to empty the mind instead of attempting to understand its contents. We see our agitation as the result of thinking too much rather than of not having  as yet  thought enough. Its time for our societies to take on board the promises and advantages of Philosophical Meditation.Articles like this make me wish that more people were exposed to more types of meditation and had proper guidance as well so that they might get a more complete picture of the process.

Its not understanding its the fabrication of what Ill call pseudounderstanding.So TsongKha pa Nagarjuna etc. all do extensive philosophizing. This is a very important part of Madhyamaka  the fount from which action and practice spring and return. Thought is not some lesser part of an enlightened being it is part of the whole which must be aligned with the way things are. Modern philosophers like Deleuze and Guattari and Francois Laruelle are very much carrying on the same sort of tradition though without its traditional trappings. You are presenting a somewhat traditional view of philosophy that having read these people I would not apply to them. In the same way that you point to compassion ethics and teaching as necessary goods I see this form of philosophy as likewise essential in clarifying how things are. gtUltimately speaking ultimate speaking being the most in line with truth there are no conditioned beings.You are creating a hierarchy between the two truths. It is no more truthful to say that things dont exist under ultimate analysis than to say that they do exist conventionally. This is very key. If you create some sort of hierarchy between them then you distance yourself from convention  all that anyonething ever interacts with  life. And this is the brilliance of Madhyamakha in asserting the emptiness of emptiness. It isnt higher than conventional truth it is a conventional truth.gtthose who think there are such things as conditioned beings are the ones who are deluded and need to be freed from this trapNo those who realize that all apparent beings are conditioned are people who realize the second truth. Conditioned  empty. People who believe there are people places or things with essences are people who need to realize Ultimate Truth.Fwiw I generally like to avoid void as it hearkens to Advaitalike conceptions of Nothingness the Absolute etc whereas emptiness is more closely related to the technical meaning we are using  things are empty of intrinsic nature.gtI think what youre getting at is that philosophy can be used to enlighten those who dont understand void.What Im getting at is philosophy both as a way to realize these truths continually and as a means of engaging the world through them. How do these truths apply to my daily life in a capitalistic society? How does Deleuzes distinction between idealism and empiricism deepen my understanding of emptiness and possibility and justice? They ways I understand and talk about Buddhism? How I think about and engage in politics?As with the commentators from my last post I view these as the important bits. Emptiness is a means of moving about in the conventional world the only one well and freely.And yes the heart sutra says it well form is emptiness emptiness is form,Buddhism,ci1xklq,1,t5_2qhnf

By not clinging we are observing without judgement but because observing without judgement could become a mental construct itself to be clung to  we say that it is observing without observing.gt I dont really see what a certain dhyana state has do with abiding. Abiding is not a special state it is meditation itself.Right if we treat any state as a special state than we are already using our discriminatory faculties.gtThe point of meditation is not a special state of experience be it calm not calm thinking not thinking observing or not observing. I am not convinced meditation has a point. Thats fine.  Some might say the point of meditation is to end the idea of having a point.

1254092,0,t3_28fc7g,Its not clear whether youre looking for something that gives an overview of Buddhism or a primary source of teaching like the Bible. If the latter such a thing doesnt exist. There are thousands of sutras tantras and other scriptures covering a vast territory of different schools.Theres an anthology of Buddhist scriptures aptly named A Buddhist Bible by Dwight Goddard. It includes Pali Sanskrit Chinese and Tibetan sources and a couple of modern writings. Many of the included sources are trimmed down to best of selections and the translation can be quirky at times but it may be what youre looking for in terms of primary sources that cover a broad  view of Buddhism.Go for a  edition or later if published as the first edition from  is almost entirely focused on Zen Buddhist sources.A Buddhist Bible  includes a large portion of the Surangama aka Shurangama Sutra which as cited by uEssenceofbuddhism in this thread is to my knowledge the closest thing to a complete syllabus of Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist meditative practice that you will find among primary sources.For an explanatory overview check The Compass Of Zen by Zen Master Seung Sahn. It is a very well organized analysis of Buddhism from its most basic and early roots to what the author puts forth as the highest teachings. Unfortunately he uses the term Hinayana which many see as pejorative to talk about the rudimentary teachings but the analysis is spoton and of benefit to practitioners of all schools. Vajrayana is not highlighted per se but its doctrines are split between the Mahayana and Zen sections roughly delineating the Tantric and Dzogchen paths respectively. The focus is on putting the teachings into practice.The Shambala Dragon Editions version is the one you want. There exists an earlier version that is the mere skeleton of the later book with only pithy Chinese calligraphic quotes translated into terse English phrases much of it can be cryptic to the newcomer.For an overview of the basic Theravada teaching from which the rest of Buddhism sprang I recommend What The Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula. It is a very clear if dry explanation that includes quoted sources some Suttas and the Dhammapada which others in this thread have recommended.For a very scholastic overview of primary sources check out A Survey Of Buddhism and The Eternal Legacy both by Sangharakshita. They cover in depth doctrines of the major schools and points out both their historical and philosophical relationships the latter book focuses on the scriptures themselves. Tantric Vajrayana is lightly covered and Zen and Dzogchen are given short shrift but otherwise these books are both scholastic monuments. To taper into Sangharakshitas heady style you might try his The Three Jewels.,Buddhism,ciap887,3,t5_2qhnf

To extrapolate from that that all phenomena is empty is to miss the entire point and unfortunately to unleash untold misery on the world as we clearly see through the scandal tainted world of the Mahayana Buddhist tradition especially as it pertains to the west.

1301117,0,t1_ciflhpu,I would like to bow to your understanding and knowledge of a very complicated subject save for the fact that you are so entirely emphatic about what you are saying. No one can be that concise and draw such boundaries withing this practice. There are too many forms of Buddhist belief for anyone to come off in any kind of complete or absolute dialectic. Buddhism teaches their are no black and whites and everything under the sun is in one way or another relative to the person beholding it for the first time.  There are Buddhist monks that practice animism Ive seen forest monks give blessings in Thailand calling on spirits of animism. In Mahayana some forms clearly pay homage to many deities and demigods. In Vajrayana practice especially spiritualism abounds almost unfettered. I can think of at least one Zen monk here in America who privately ascribes to being Jewish in his heart. If someone wants to attach to his or her older rituals from former beliefs thats entirely acceptable. There is a name for it which escapes me at present. If coming to Buddhism means finding relative ideas in Christianity or any other religion I see nothing wrong there. Buddhism was born inside a greater spiritual envelope of Hinduism which is decidedly multireligious rolled up under a singular religious banner. Particular attention to Buddhas teachings within the Zen paradigm often brings practitioners to a place where no god and no real demigods can possibly exist and then why all the fuss given even toward actual Buddha. Nonetheless in Japan they bow at that image. The Buddhism Ive read about for many years now starting with Watts is far too much of a multiumbrella practice to say you cant be Buddhist to the exclusion to another any religiousspiritual leaning andor belief. The whole concept of Buddhism is that there is room for all and certainly no strict edicts no absolutes no exclusions. If the pope tomorrow suddenly said he was a CatholicBuddhist I would never think of him as any less Buddhist than say the Dali Llama. If nothing else Buddhism doesnt recognize any particular deities while vigorously giving the cultural nod to many. The Buddhist temples are literally lined with statues pictures and reliefs of gods and godlike beings. You say there is no place for Jesus or Moses or Allah in all of that? rhetoricalThere are no obligations in Buddhism if there were it wouldnt be Buddhism. It would be something else.

Most likely she was taught like that from her parents or coworkers. Shes a product of her environment and I dont definitely know that she even had a choice in the matter. I doubt that anybody knows that for sure.Good Christians are tolerant  Jesus says Love Thy Neighbor. I think as a practicing Buddhists we should try to understand where she is coming from and help her stop suffering  which she does every time she discriminates against nonChristians. I doubt that she would consciously choose to suffer.The moment we lash back at her we start suffering too. Lets have compassion toward her instead.

Natural world natural laws Im a part of the natural world I have to obey the natural laws.edit Also I think both eternalism and presentism are correct. Both allow for the idea of an observer. In eternalism intelligence is the sum of knowledge of what was is and will be. On the other hand presentism is the is currently experienced and the sum of all knowledge of the single observer. As an individual mind I can only believe in presentism I can only be in the present.

Sujato and Brahmali argue that  we know for certain that key doctrinal aspects of these texts were transmitted accurately over a nearly year period and  a similar culture of oral transmission is said to have existed since the time of the Buddha so we can infer that few differences were introduced to the core teachings in the earliest  years of Buddhist history. In other words if these geographically remote and doctrinally disparate schools got it right for almost  years would you expect the preschismatic oral preservers to totally screw up the transmission during the first two centuries after the death of the Buddha? Its possible...but it seems unlikely.Also if a plurality of the preschismatic teachings had been altered by tamperers or cobbled together from the speech of different authors then the texts would be expected to show signs of this activity but they dont see Chapter  Character of the Early Buddhist Texts.,Buddhism,cjdgxdg,8,t5_2qhnf

I must do something to end all this suffering for others! I must do something to end this suffering in me!And having that motivation come up with a plan come up with a goal try to do something which will result in the alleviation of suffering no matter how major or how minor.Even if it is holding open a door hold open a door.If its helping someone carry something.If its helping to build a houseIf its helping someone in emotional distressIf its helping someone to have fun or be at peace in a time of sufferingIf its helping yourself develop skills and habit which will result in your own happinessThinkMay all beings including myself be removed from all sufferingAbiding in equanimity in nothing but contentment and joyMay I strive diligently and attain all understandings that I mustSo that I might be able to accomplish this for all beings.When you set this motivations actions will follow them and youll surely reap the results of such a purely set motivation.,Buddhism,cjwoolb,3,t5_2qhnf

In Buddhism there can be diversity but each alleged thing is ultimately empty meaning lacking inherent existence or is ultimately unfindable when sought.

A void is absence not a positive implication.gt P Reality has no creatorAgreed then things cannot be be selfexistent things cannot have an individual substance. Without such a substance they cannot selfexist.gt  and therefore totally void or insubstantial in other words GodlikeIf God is void then God is NOT. Not sure what the argument is here. Most Theists I have known argue that God is the only true substance.gt You cant leave reality.Agreed the real cannot be escaped. But the truth is relativistic so... define reality again?

QM provides this and a lot of newagers take it to mean that consciousness determines reality or that consciousness somehow is the underlying substance of reality but the truth is simply that it is demonstrable that the universe is nondeterministic.

Whatever that is...gt It seems rather excessively cruel to plop some separate being into existence without choice who greatly fears death and becoming nothing forever only to soon annihilate it.

This misapprehension is one that can be called grasping at true existence.gt Its just really taboo to believe that were all the sameIn order for us to be all the same we would first require true substance of some sort.

1993411,0,t1_ckt760v,Basically it is necessary to do concentration meditation before reflecting on the nature of reality insight meditation anyways. So when you begin your sit thoughts will arise and all you do is bring your attentionfocus back to the breathe. When you notice another thought you simply let go of it do not follow it or explore it and bring attention back to the breathe. The goal is not to control the mind but to develop concentration which is a skill to the point where it is not so hard to be aware of the present moment for an extended period of time. This developed awareness is necessary for solid insight meditation to take place. In order to clearly focus and investigate phenomena you must be concentrated so you can actually realize the nature of these things without getting distracted by the monkey mind that you were just working to calm in your concentration meditation!.So at some point during your focus on breathe you actively and intentionally begin to reflect. You could reflect on anything but the entire reason the Buddha was meditating in the first place is because he was experiencing a sense of dissatisfactionexistential suffering that all beings are tormented by hence chasing pleasures endlessly and lacking true contentment.So the basis of insight meditation is the Four Noble Truths as described above. That is how you should guide your insight meditation by looking deeply into any phenomena that is risen and understanding how you currently experience it and what that experience consists of dissatisfaction due to everchanging phenomena.Concentration meditation Let go of thoughts in order to bring back awareness of breathe.Insight meditation Exploration of phenomena thoughts included in order to understand their nature.Do you see? Edit The Four Noble truths are insight of reality as described by the rightly self awakened one the Buddha. To an unenlightened being they are concepts that can act as a guide towards realization. When you truly realize enlightenment for yourself those truths will make sense to you experientially. Tis the point of insight meditation. To directly see the nature of reality for oneself.The entire reason for this is to free oneself of the sense of dissatisfaction due to ignorance convinced in permanence and self clinging. That is what we investigate and understand the nature of when insight is developed.,Buddhism,ckten4j,3,t5_2qhnf

Although a balanced compassionate noble life may look more austere than we are used to it may also look lush and rich. Attaching to either form is a problem. So rather than attaching to the form of life hold to your deeper values and the aspiration to wake up and help your family and all beings wake up from this suffering dream.Keep your aspiration to wake up and just go about your business. If you do well you do well if you dont do well thats still okay. Just do what you need to do to help your family and all beings moment to moment.Everything that comes to you comes based on your previous causes how youve used your intention and action. If you have been generous you will receive generously from life. If you have used your speech well your speech will have powerful effect. If you have kept kindness always at the forefront kindness will appear in your life. So if you keep your correct inner relationship everything you need will come to you but if you cling and clutch you will make a desperate clingandclutch life.Cause and effect are clear.

2160224,0,t1_clecqe5,Its letting go a little but not completely. Totally letting go would result in nirvana.gtThe first jhana arises after...That description of jhana is accurate but its not a complete picture. It doesnt acknowledge how the first jhana refers to the state of mind which is secluded from unwholesome qualities for instance.Wrong intention is described as the intention sensuality illwill or harmlessness. Can you reach jhana with a mind of sensuality or illwill? No thats why the Buddha called them hindrances to concentration and insight. I think its important to realize that the conditioning of the eightfold path is not a process which occurs after time its not right view  then right intention. The Buddha likened the eightfold path to a raft. The raft is present when the conditions are present not when they have been present. The reason why this is important because it demonstrates the connection between the eightfold path and meditation the development of the path is necessary.gtI understand that when I meditate my only goal should be to stay focused on my breath. Every other thought is a distraction and will only hurt my meditation if I let them interfere with my one point concentration on my object. But when Im out of meditation I feel that its okay to desire jhana and higher states of consciousness...Since the first jhana has subtle thoughts present thoughts themselves are not an obstacle to jhana other than the nd jhana and so forth. What is an obstacle is the quality of the thoughts. If you want to develop your meditation skill you need to dedicate yourself to renunciation and get all of the muck out of the way the unwholesome qualities of mind such as craving. Jhana itself should teach you this. Besides concentration what makes it so blissful? What makes it so calm? The absence of unwholesome mental qualities sensuality illwill restlessness laziness and doubt. Now the point of Buddhism isnt to abide in pleasure but its important to seclude oneself from unwholesome states of mind and one of the results of that is jhana. Now this seclusion doesnt come from pushing your thoughts away. As the Buddha taught right intention right thought is supported by right view. Understand how your unwholesome thoughts arise and how wholesome ones thoughts of renunciation goodwill or harmlessness arise. Thats when you can start to cultivate right view and as a result wrong view weakens. As a result of that unwholesome thoughts stop arising. And so meditation becomes a natural thing not something based in desire.,Buddhism,cleewx7,6,t5_2qhnf

Hard is as described by Buddhas teachers in the Vissudhimagga and as Pa Auk Sayadaw teaches which is full absorption meaning you dont have any physical senses someone can scream at you and you wont hear them. In Pa Auk Sayadaws tradition for instance once you go on retreat you may have to do hours and hours a day to get slightly pulled into it. You need to loosen your desire to obtain it Jhana is about letting go and you should read about the hindrances and antidotes. Generally speaking long term concentrative practice can get you there or intense practice done right.Jhana is a worthy goal and very positive mental state too is generated from there. But keep in mind that Samadhi is about stilling the mind so access concentration and soft Jhana are often useful. There is conjecture as to whether Buddha actually taught Jhana as taught by his teachers or as he remembered it as he practiced as child because a it involves bodily awareness and b was specifically distinguished. Full Absorbed Jhana however tends to be considered right concentration and there are examples of this being used by many practitioners throughout the ages.I had the privledge of seeing Ajahn Brahm for  talks this weekend and had a book signed by him!

I dont know if any buddhist meditation methods are aimed at stressrelief.  In fact IME they may do the opposite by helping develop insight into repressed or unwholesome things about ourselves.  Buddha didnt teach us how to dissociate or separate from pain but how to understand it and uproot unwholesome actions that cause more stress.

2294437,0,t1_clvad9x,Consciousness vijna is defined as a species of cognizance that is split into a threefold structure consisting of organfunctionobject. So an eye which has a cognitive function of vision that perceives visual objects.  Consciousness is ultimately an illusion because it is predicated upon the very abstractions that define it organ function object. The idea is to realize the unreality of those elements and if you are able to then the seerseeingseen structure will collapse. However it does not collapse in the sense that seerseeingseen fuse together into a single unbroken field but rather it collapses because it is realized that seerseeingseen never actually originated or existed in the first place. Thus consciousness vijna is recognized to be nonarisen and ones consciousness then is revealed in its natural condition as jna i.e. wisdom. ,Buddhism,clvb4ay,2,t5_2qhnf

2345912,0,t1_cm17ylo,gt  I also dont see a reason to categorically dismiss them as nondharma either.I dont dismiss them on ideological grounds i.e. simply because they are Mahayana but because they contain teachings that are irreconcilable with my understanding of the coherent paradigm of the Dhamma of the Pali Canon.gtIm generally one of the people speaking in favor of oral traditions while others start saying hundreds of years of playing telephone.This is the exact thing Im trying to oppose. I am not saying the Pali Canon is infallible. For example see Majjhima  The  Marks of a Great Man. Of course this is more or less easily dismissed as being in direct conflict with other Suttas in the Canon.gtFrom Ashoka to the finalization of the Canon there is a large gap where we have fragments of some discourses but are otherwise left with the knowledge that any amount of innovation could have occurred even if the sutta is in line with accepted texts it would only be provisionally acceptable.I think the only difference of opinion is regarding where to place the burden of proof by default. You are taking somewhat of a middle course but I will put the choice into starker terms just for the sake of illustration. The scientific position would be to say unless there is corroboration of stone engravings we assume the origin is apocryphal until proven otherwise. The conservative position would be while stone engravings are excellent corroborating evidence for some of the Suttas there is also a lot of corroboration among the texts from other Canons and the circumstantial evidence that a systematic oral tradition could very well have transmitted the teaching quite faithfully on the whole. Therefore a reasonable assumption would be to take the Suttas and Vinaya as generally authentic in the absence of any evidence to the contrary such as but not limited to some degree of inconsistency whether doctrinal or linguistic or whatever with the body of the Canon.gtknowledge that any amount of innovation could have occurredThe problem I have in this area is my sense that raising question of innovation casts a greater shadow of doubt over the Canon as a whole than the significance or danger of its actual occurrence. Sort of like the Ebola scare when the statistical odds are much lower than the emotional perception.

2354073,0,t3_2mbeck,gtAlthough I accept intellectually most of the Buddhas teachings I can no longer accept them as having inherent value particularly compassion and loving kindness. Why should I feel compassionate? Whenever I practise loving kindness I feel a resistance as love and compassion are merely illusory emotions as is hatred sadness etc.I assume this is something common... when people hear that Buddhism teaches emptiness they get eager to reject everything and say that its all nonexistent and illusory and whatever. This may be true on a certain level but the only people that really know this are those who have also eliminated their suffering totally or at least to a great extent as is what happens at the first stage of enlightenment. Otherwise its all actually theory itself  the thought that everything is illusory is clung to as if it werent illusory.Since this is all just an idea that we cling to its potentially harmful to the practice. It can set you up for lots of doubt and overthinking. Its also another reason why drug use can be harmful. You have blissful experiences of clear awareness but a lack of understanding causes you to get obsessed about thinking about things in a new way and a bunch of issues come from that.So stay away from drugs no matter how much you think you can take them... delusion can sneak up on you very easily.Get more comfortable with following the ways of the world. Dont be resistant to it. In Buddhist practice we start out living in the world but we gradually transcend it. We dont try to just throw it all away because its all illusory. Thats akin to being antisocial in my view. We try to learn more about it through mindfulness and meditation. We use compassion and loving kindness to deal with people more wholesomely and to abandon anger animosity etc. We all start out with bad habits we just need to get them out of the way by developing wholesome habits... thus creating the proper conditions for insight.,Buddhism,cm2oa7x,2,t5_2qhnf

2357115,0,t1_cm2v0r5,The problem is not with the Dharmaguptakan Vinaya Im assuming its essentially the same as the Theravadin but in the way Mahayana practice tends to relate to the Vinaya. I have seen a variety of sources where because of great compassion according to Rev. JiyuKennet or ideas about following the spirit not the letter parajika offenses are oftentimes overlooked.Interestingly I spoke to a Vajrayana monk of many years last week who was explaining an aspect of the Vajrayana approach to the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya I was not aware of. Apparently there is a commentarial overlay that adds to the requisite mental state for violating a given rule say for example sexual intercourse. The requisite intention is broken down into premeditation knowledge and then owning it. So there is either no violation or a lesser offense than defeat if the sexual intercourse had not been planned or was regretted after the fact. If this is accurate its an interesting illustration of the grave differences between having more or less the same Vinaya rules and interpreting and living by more or less the same Vinaya.When you multiply this effect over centuries where monks and nuns who would be considered defeated by Theravadin standards are participating in ordinations it raises considerable doubt about the validity of the ordination lineage. This is why the Theravadin monks do not as a general rule pay respects to Mahayana monks and nuns. As has been explained to me it is not out of disrespect of their practice or doctrinal differences but because of these technical concerns about the validity of the lineage as there are injunctions in the Vinaya against doing so. There are also ordination lineages in Theravadin countries where there are concerns regarding validity.When Bhikkhu Bodhi argues along the lines of what you mention about the Dharmaguptakan bhikkhuni lineage he does so with even less detail than you provide and breezily asserts that it is a valid equivalent to a living Theravadin bhikkhuni lineage. This is disingenuous in light of the concerns I have raised and if he were really respectful of the Vinaya from a Theravadin point of view he would have provided thorough evidence that not only does the lineage have the Dhammaguptaka Vinaya in its Canon but that it was actually the basis of their monastic conduct they respected it meticulously that there were never any interruptions in the lineage that they conducted their ordinations in line with the required technicalities and that all of the above was also applicable to the monks that were participating in the ordinations as well. The fact instead of offering up a detailed report on these questions he instead tried to breeze over it all leads me to believe a couple of things . the complete absence of inquiry points in the direction that the lineage is not valid from a Theravadin perspective because if it were there would have been an effort made to publicize the history of their strict adherence to the letter of the Vinaya. If the lineage were really valid historically in practice I think at least as far as I know recognizing the Bhikkhuni lineage by the Theravadin monks and institutions would be a definite possibility. But you never see this issue addressed in a genuine or open way by the bhikkhuni proponents. Its always a push to accept the nominal validity and rush people on to the next point nothing to see here folks. . The nd point is that the way this issue is being railroaded by the probhikkhuni factions shows a general disregard and disrespect for the Vinaya. Its a kick it to the curb attitude when it gets in the way of what they want. So regardless of the validity of the ordinations its an inauspicious start for any Theravadin order of renunciates.,Buddhism,cm31th7,2,t5_2qhnf

I was raised evangelical baptist but how could I tell someone this is the way when I hadnt even considered other paths. I started researching and at first I felt like I was betraying my family and my church. Eventually it came to me that I hadnt chosen a religion and this fear was a result of indoctrination. I wasnt a Christian because I never chose to be a Christian. Stepping out was a way of confirming my faith by making it a choice for once. I requested that my church study group learn about other religions. On my own I went out and researched. I found better paths that better fit what I believed. I never went back but it was a conscious decision about how I wanted to live my life. Dont stay in a religion just to please someone else. It is a personal decision.

2400301,0,t1_cm8cm8x,gt There is nothing stopping you from adopting a stricter standard for yourself or recommending it to others.The Buddha sometimes called people fools for asserting and positing ideologies that strayed away from the path.In this way the Buddha was setting standards for how to practice the way and how not to.  He even gave measuring sticks to gauge our efforts in concentration morals and wisdom  thats the  fold path.Quotes like the one I gave above are simply the Buddha offering us higher standards to aim for in our practice.  So when I said superior viewpoints I was referring to the Buddhas use of comparing lesser and greater in that quote.If one is a selfish murdering thief vegetarian  it wouldnt make a difference anyway.  The Buddha not enforcingstandardizing vegetarianism is for  fold reasons we can infer As not to exclude anyone from potentially becoming his disciples.  If he rejected certain people based on what they ate as laity those people would be turned away from the dharma  and the Buddha knew this. Monks accept alms of leftovers.  The Buddha even gave guidelines that if there was any reason to suspect people got the meat for the monks not to eat it.So in this way the Buddha ensured there was not even a tacit condoning of killing as a part of the path of monkshood nor an increase in demand for animals to be killed and that all are welcome into the laity.  Reducing intentionalkilling is within the grasp of almost anyone in a modern country at every single meal.  To compare this suggestion to devadattas request to prohibit this is apples and oranges.All this Bhikkhu is doing in his article is extrapolating the Buddhas wisdom on how monks view meateating and taking it to the next level while suggesting its likely just a progression on the path as one develops.

2475628,0,t3_2nv630,I think it is important to pose the questions you are considering and to develop an understanding of sexuality from your own experience.  Simply depriving yourself of sexmasturbation will likely not lead to you develop any wisdom.  I began bringing mindfulness into sexual acts over the past year or so.  My goal was to experience it clearly for what it is the basic sensory experiences and my mental states.  If I watched porn or started masturbating but then suddenly stopped and observed myself I could tell I was craving it and that this craving was unpleasant and agitating.  I noticed that I acted differently around attractive women and this again was an excited but uncomfortable state for me to be in.  Trying to clearly and directly experience an orgasm revealed it to be incredibly unsatisfying and completely unworthy of all the psychological obsession I had formed for it.  Now I hardly seem to have any sexual desires at all.  It started to fizzle out while I was in a relationship and Im now single and almost never crave sex.I could not have learned this from just listening to a teacher talk about it or from refusing to have sex. Mindful experience of sex is what tamed my desire for it.  So it may be important for you to have sex in order to learn but make sure you have the right intentions.  Do not engage in it to satisfy your cravings for it.  Question your cravings and experience the problems of desiring it for yourself. Hope this helps... ,Buddhism,cmhp9yo,1,t5_2qhnf

2553566,0,t3_2oxe3z,Whats interesting to me is the different approaches to Pure Land that exists out there. I agree with much of Shin Buddhism and I think the points that I disagree are mostly just different ways of describing the same concept. True Self is one of those.It makes sense in English and in translation but my tradition is Vietnamese and we dont really use the word self. That is specifically that the concept of self and other at a linguistic level isnt very clear and neither is the concept of singularity or plurality. So discussions about True Self or selfhood at all in Vietnamese are always weoriented and you plural and us.Mostly what Im saying is.. Teachings on self even in the same tradition just read and sound very differently in a language that takes very roundabout ways to refer to ones self to begin with. There are many teachings in Pure Land about selfpower versus otherpower. I know in Japanese Namu Amida Butsu is linguistically similar since Namu is also a word for I so the Japanese Niem Phat forget how they spell it is a conflation of selfother.In Vietnamese that conflationthe wisdom of selfpower and otherpower being indistinct from one anotheris implicit within the very structure of the language as well although not in that particular phrase.There are a lot of subtleties in the teachings that are completely lost in English and its a little saddening. ,Buddhism,cmrvzc9,3,t5_2qhnf

When asked about the relationship between Buddha and Christgt I suppose from the mahayana point of view of benevolence and the point of view of sainthood that they are like saints talking to each other. Their relationship might be that of wakeful saints coming from different traditions. One Christ came from the Jewish tradition and one the Buddha came from the Hindu tradition. Both were stepping out of their traditions and beginning to teach a new kind of truth or an old truth in a new way. In some sense what they were doing was very close.I too was captivated by his rhetoric one upon a time. Now the above comes across as just nonsense. It is someone who is trying to sell his Dharma to a bigger audience and shows lack of understanding with regard to the uniqueness of the Buddha and his Dhamma. gt Or Jack KornfieldMy daughter was brought up learning about Jewish history and celebrating the holidays. She is also Christian from her mothers side so she was baptized at San Franciscos Glide Memorial church. And we also lived in a Hindu country for a long time so she has that influence as well. When my daughter was younger she was asked Well what are you? And she said Gee Im Christian and Buddhist and Jewish and Hindu and some other things  I dont know what else was in there. In her simple answer  she was like nine years old at the time  was a reflection that underneath all these different religions there is a commonality that at best involves treating one another with great care and respect based on love virtue and integrity.gt Kornfield also wrote the introduction to a book that is specifically about the parallels between between Christ and the Buddha. This notion that Buddhists neednt study or be encouraged to study other traditions to enrich their understanding especially mystic traditions is frankly absurd.Jack Kornfield is a meditation teacher. From where I stand anyone who believes in meditation as a Buddhist practice misunderstands the Buddhas teachings and is motivated by selfview and attachment to results to engage in what then comes down to being a form of ritual practice. The Buddha did not teach any of what goes on in the name of Buddhist practice existing today. He taught about the mental and physical phenomena which make up our moment to moment experience most particularly that these are conditioned and nonself. Therefore rather than prescribe some form of formal practice which necessarily must be aimed at some future result he drew his audiences attention to what is going on right now. It is the habit of paying attention to what appears now with a level of right view that wisdom can develop to the point of experiencing the different insight knowledge and finally enlightenment. How else do you think hundreds of his direct audience attained enlightenment there and then while listening to him speak?Given this no one with any level of right understanding would advice another not to read or to read anything because that would amount to following a kind of wrong practice. Instead of suggesting to do or not do one should draw the other persons attention to what is going on now. Only in doing this can one be said to study the Buddhas teachings. And for those that have had any studying take place the truth of the One Path to enlightenment or ekayana is also revealed. With this comes the inclination not to be interested in other teachings since they are seen as not being the Path in fact are wrong paths.  ,Buddhism,cmslrxu,2,t5_2qhnf

The great part about meditation that is also guided by precepts is Buddhisms precepts are about freedom from remorse  not about original sin or being commanded by god etc etcAs the Buddha saidgtSkillful virtues have freedom from remorse as their purpose... freedom from remorse as their reward...gtFreedom from remorse has joy as its purpose joy as its reward.,Buddhism,cn0pli1,11,t5_2qhnf

The rest of the time you might quote two passages from the Lankavatara Sutra in an attempt to prove your argument the problem with that is you havent even bother to read the Sutra itself and I always quote the context in the very Sutra itself proving your argument wrong.......then when your proven wrong you always circle back to the its conventional literary device you aint fooling noone.gt However doing so gets to the point where I cannot successfully decipher the activity from beating my head against a wall  it surely is akin to talking to a wall  and so the nature of my comment is apropos given the circumstances. are you joking me does everyone want to see what beating your head against the wall really looks like?Heres a linkon this link I told youkrodha the Sadhinirmocana Sutra says the Second Turning teachings are NOT Superior and the Third Turning teachings are the Superior teachings. and I quoted the SutraSadhinirmocana SutraThen the Worldhonored One with an underlying intent turned the wheel for the second time This turning of the wheel was marvelous and wonderful indeed. Nevertheless there were teachings superior to this for it also had to be interpreted and occasioned controversy .andThe Worldhonored One then with an explicit meaning for the third time turned the wheel of doctrine This turning was the most marvelous and wonderful that had ever occurred in the world. It had no superior nor did it contain any implicit meaning nor occasion any controversy .and what was your reply to my proof???gtMENo im towing the the party line of the Buddha in the Sadhinirmocana Sutra when he says the Third Turning is superior to the second turning..gtYOUKrodhaClearly not since the stra does not advocate for anything of the sort. Youre simply wanting to see something so that you feel validated in your unfounded attempt at a polemical dispute well Im sorry  no dice. talk about beating my head against the wall you cant even admit what is clearly written in the Sutra itself.its like me TELLING you then SHOWING you the DMV driving manual says and I quote  the stop sign is redand then you turn around and say the DMV manual NEVER says that ever it never said the stop sign is redLOL thats why I have to quit tallking to you you either You make up stuff that is hearsay and cannot be proven.  When I show you straight up facts you pretend these facts dont existlike the link up above. When I show you that it says the Buddha Nature is the True Self....... you then turn around and say the Sutra never said that...... When I show you that the Sutra teach that the Third Turning is Superior to the Second Turning ...... you say  It doesnt say that.... um krodha thats EXACTLY what it says word for word your just in denialNow that is what I call beating your head against the wall.Now when I start creepily stalking you everywhere you go on a Buddhist forum harassing you and making up arguments and hearsay about your teachings that I cannot prove nor try too then argue with you and pretend that the sutras you quote dont exactly say what they are saying then you can complain about beating your head against the wall. ,Buddhism,cn66fsv,2,t5_2qhnf

2867959,0,t1_cnu21ma,    My point was Do not be so attached to a onesided view!And this is the problem you refuse to acknowledge.  In your case there should be one view  that of Shakyamuni Buddha and the Hinayana path.  It should not be Daniel Ingrams postmodern revisionist Dharma Lite he has concocted for the newagers.  You refuse to understand that there is no such animal as updating the term Arhat.  The qualities which define an Arhat are clearly listed in the suttas.  Suttas that you and Ingram unjustifiably ignore.     I personally would say that PRAJNA is a good definition of AwakeningYou would be wrong.  If you look at the Pali or Sanskrit it refers to insight or discriminating knowlwedge.  What it is not is awakening.  Once again you cant just make up definitions to fit your fancy.    The only thing that matters is that you find out the answer to WHO AM I?No what matters is suffering and the release from suffering.  This who am I trip is just an intellectual trip.    many teachers say that the full regalia of signs that the Buddha enumerated as signs of an Arhat come after cultivating the form which many Zen masters never did.Cite the suttasutra.    Anyway this is why it is good that as a religious leader Shakyamuni Buddha himself said to only rely on your own experience of jhana and wisdom not on authority but to verify and find the Dharma out for ourselves within our experience.This is wrong as well.  This is a misinterpretation of the Kalamas sutta that you see  of people misunderstand.  People love using this sutta as an attempt to rationalize whatever religious ego trip they are on.  In the Kalamas sutta Shayamuni is addressing a tribe that is unable to determine which is the best religious path for them after being exposed to numerous religious traditions.    Perhaps that is why Buddhism has so little strife in comparison to the other religions where the leaders never gave their followers much selfresponsibility and permission for selfdiscovery and everyone just argues over what was meant when this was said.Actually no.  There is a coherent narrative among Hinayana Mahayana and Vajrayana respectively.    Maybe he made a big one in thinking he was a Arhat and not just a streamwinner.Thats an awfully huge mistake  one that an Arhat wouldnt make...which has been my point all along.  So if he made the mistake he should own up to it.  And people wonder why hes cast in a devilish light.    Also you do not personally know Ingram and I do not know him that well either so I wouldnt say anything suggesting lack of compassion. Your last comment to me did not seem very compassionate.

2920456,0,t3_2thg98,After getting out of the Air Force I went through a series of minimeltdowns. Nothing to keep me out of work or out of the mainstream social flow but each case was a moment of realization that all things were not well with me. All these episodes are a bit too many to list but suffice to say there were many. Gradually I came out of the turmoil and found a place where Im well situated and very grounded  even happy. What you describe sounds a little like one or two of the more significant incidents that befell me over the longest time. I was always afraid I was losing it or about to lose it with these things. Some of this happened while I had a good job beautiful girlfriend etc. I cant go out on a limb here too much but I think you are letting loose a lot of pent up and stored negative emotions that you probably kept bottled up and in tow for a long long time. My advice is not to look at it as a bad thing as much as it was a thing that needed to happen for the sake of your own overall sanity. You should see a counselor andor a doctor about it really soon. Dont be afraid a whole bunch of people go down these weird paths and I believe it usually works out well as long as they we get to find an outside source to work it out properly. I was lucky it turned out to be nothing more than a series of delayed PTSD reactions that oozed out of the mental sludge left over from being in a war much longer than I should have been and then leading a life after as a major fuckup for a good long time. But everyone is different. It sounds to me only a wildassed guess that you are feeling the product of being too long under your own heavy hand of perfectionism. As I say thats only a guess. But it would also explain the similarities and parallels to classic PTSD symptoms. For me it turned out well and it was ultimately a good thing a very good thing. Just get yourself some professional help its nothing to mess around with.  ,Buddhism,co02cgy,2,t5_2qhnf

3295890,0,t3_2xv84g,Although not being in the position i would like to give a general advice Do whatever is possible for you and what makes sense for you.I live vegan because i think this reduce the suffering on the most possible level without risiking my health. But i am lucky because i never have had a bigger craving for specific food. No feeling that i need to eat meat or cheese etc. And in my area there are several stores who are specific for a vegan diet. And i have the money and my family do not think that i am crazy. This are all factors which make it very easy for me to live vegan. For other people this can be completly different. If you are suffering because you always have the feeling you have to eat meat than maybe it will be better to eat meat and to stop suffering and to concentrate on other points. But do not trick yourself maybe you just need time to get used to it like quitting smoking.Other reason can be health reason and that you should not play in any form with your diet. Or a healty vegan or vegetarian diet will be too expensive. Or it just makes no sense to you to eat vegetarian or vegan and you would never support this diet by yourself but only because someone said you should do it. Do whatever is possible to reduce suffering. Think of others but also of yourself. Do not torture yourself. Support what you are doing with your heart and not only because someone said it.,Buddhism,cp3yhv9,3,t5_2qhnf

But its like focusing really hard on a singlegrain of sand and not understanding that there you are standing on a wonderfulbeach with palms and the ocean. Hell as a concept of punishment and fire is a component of many religions. It is believed that it did not come into Christianity from Judaism but from Greek and Roman religions that influenced early Christianity. There are even some Buddhist teachings about a hell like concept of Naraka. Which is inspired from Diyu from ancient Chinese Cosmology. Norse religions also had a hell like concept. This depiction would fit the concept of hell in many religions.

3429527,0,t3_2zi871,The mind has been compared to a flopping fish when we sit down for meditation. Why is it easier to remain focused with dynamic stimulation? That is what our minds and brains want. Why do we need to do sitting meditation? We must train the mind to maintain single pointed awareness even while having little stimulation such as paying attention to the breath. At first the mind will freak out grasp and want something else so you will find it difficult to maintain focus. However thats the point. Continually redirecting awareness to the breath trains the mind to focus on command more and not jump from desire to desire from craving to craving. We are training ourselves not to grasp subconsiously. You would hinder yourself from stopping this meditation. The fact that it is harder is because it is a more effective excersise. Then you will take that foundation of strength of mind to the walking world and your mind will be much stronger during dynamic stimulation it will be more heedful against craving tendencies more peaceful less disturbed by occurrences. I found this to be a nice transition to sitting   Mantra meditation  Setting meditation. Practice chanting a mantra its more stimulation but less than walking around. Once your strong in that practice when its both transformative and creates a nice quiet Sammatthasamadhi then transitioning to pure sammatthasamadhi will be easier. ,Buddhism,cpj6wz2,3,t5_2qhnf

3664323,0,t3_327o79,Historian Stephen Batchelor who has recently described himself as an agnostic has gotten a lot of attention with his book Confessions of a Buddhist Atheist.  This author presents the Buddha not as an atheist or someone who questioned traditional supernatural beliefs but as someone driven by a need to understand the nature of suffering and how to overcome it.  Theres a wellknown quotation that sums it up nicely . Does a wounded soldier ask who shot the arrow or does he ask that the arrow be removed?  You can imagine someone saying This gets me out of the cycle of birth and rebirth right? and the Buddha saying Right. That too and changing the subject to something more practical.edit You may have come across the expression secular Buddhism sometimes written with a capital S. This can be confusing. In my experience the atheists outnumber the agnostics. These people generally practicemindfulness and meditation although they seem to have mixed feelingsabout the mindfulness movement which has applied mindfulnees to therapy for chronic pain stress and even mental illness. Its reduced violence in prisons. The mindfulness movement is secular but not Buddhist.    ,Buddhism,cq9yhd9,3,t5_2qhnf

3673542,0,t1_cqaz9rn,Well I was in therapy throughout high school really just . years of it and at the time medicated on Paxil. This really did nothing for me in general. I wasnt diagnosed properly and my therapy wasnt very structured. Paxil did little for me other than put me to sleep so I was taken off it.Nothing for a long time until college when inexplicably I was plagued with intrusive thoughts of violence and began to selfmutilate. I went back into therapy at the age of  and was medicated on Celesta. It took a full year before I got a diagnosis PTSD comorbid with Borderline Personality Disorder. I had to return to the US though so my doctor couldnt continue treatment. She recommended that when I got back into the US I go into Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. I never did this. At the age of  I began to powerlift and this seemed to keep the depression at bay. I went off the medication. Violent intrusive thoughts continued and I put up with it. They came and went.At the age of  my anxiety really peaked. The PTSD in particular flared up incredibly. I was in a bad relationship at the time but I dont think either of us noticed how bad it was we get along now and no ones at fault. I think it just reminded me of childhood of trusting someone to love and protect me but being constantly fearfulknowing that nothing actually can... so I became very jumpy. Im a trained martial artist which presented a problem... Wed go out to bars and someone would bump into me or tap me on the shoulder and before I could even think about it Id taken the person down had them in an arm lock and ready to step on their throats. My girlfriend at the time couldnt take it couldnt understand why I thought people would attack me and didnt know how to reassure me that I was in a safe place. We split up and I returned to therapy.Now for the very first time a therapist really dialed in on the issue. She said I dont think you have Borderline Personality Disorder. Your symptoms resemble it a bit but the intrusive thoughts are very clearly OCD. Its a common symptom and nothing to worry about. The problem is that harmobsessions coupled with PTSD make for very violent reactions. She was actually a bad therapist though so I switched to another. This is the one that finally made a difference.This last therapist understood how much structure I needed. I said to him Ive had a lot of therapists in the past and they just want to talk about issues and they dont want to explain to me their plan so we end up getting into arguments over what were actually doing.He explained his approach. It was very methodical. It was very analytical. He said I dont really care about your past. Thats not important anymore. It might give some insight into why your mind is acting the way it is now but it doesnt really address the problem. So were going to focus on what is of practical benefit to you. He gave me homework and mental exercises to do. He made me keep a log. Whenever I found myself experiencing negative emotions he had me note it with a date and time. He had me describe what i was feeling without associating it to thoguths and feelings. He had me then describe what thoughts led to the feelings this was very very difficult to determine and we worked out how to logically break it down.. it took months for me to catch on but I got better with practice. We began to make a lot of progress. I started meditating as my devotion to Buddhism was increasing at the time and worked through a lot of exercises together to address the issues and to really dial into things.That exercise and my starting to meditate really changed things because suddenly... I could figure out what thoughts were causing the bad feelings. I could address the thoughts specifically and I could notate that the feelings were merely a reaction to how my own mind was processing information. And once I realized how it was my mind that was causing the problems suddenly... I had some small control over it. I took responsibility for my thoughts and feelings and that made all the difference.We were together for two years and during that period of time I was on an SNRIthe first SNRI Ive ever taken... I forget what the name was. But as I became better and better at identifying my own thought processes and feelings I became more and more aware that the medication was muting the feelings. And this was starting to concern me sure I was a lot better at figuring out what was wrong but how could it mean anything at all if I wasnt learning how to manage the full force of the emotions?In secret I dont recommend this I went off the SNRIs. And the withdrawals... ugh.. okay.. never stop taking antidepressants cold turkey unless youre a masochist. Theres a phenomenon called brain zaps that occurs and its basically.. any movement any sound any bright light any change in light any change in temperature any sensation any scent... it causes what feels like a jolt of electricity to tear through your nervous system. It is the most painful experience I can remember in my life. And it lasted for several months. But the experiment confirmed what I had suspected I wasnt feeling what I shouldve been. Suddenly I was happier. The sun was brighter. The wind felt cool and beautiful on my skin. I no longer wanted to stay in bed all day. I had reason and motivation and energy to get up in the morning. And I could think clearly. It was like a heavy fog had been lifted.My therapist chewed me out after he found out what Id done. That was very dangerous he said. Someone less introspective of you couldve experienced rebound depression from the withdrawal. Some people get suicidal. And I know you well enough that I worry.. Im not worried that youre suicidal but I know for a fact that if you tried to kill yourself youd succeed. Youre not the type of person to fuck around.I said to him Were at war with my own mind. Weve made a lot of progress but we also handicapped it to help us. Now its time no more drugs okay? None of this will mean anything if I cant be happy just as myself.So depending on how you look at it it either took me about ten years to figure out that the drugs werent helping after the fact I realized that every time I had been medicated through depression it was only when I stopped the medication that the depression went away even if the anxiety symptoms persisted or it took me three years.When you start with your therapist Id just mention to himher that youre open to medication but you want it to be a shortterm solution to complement the therapy. Hisher program should then account for the lowering of the dose over time and you avoid the godawful withdrawal I went through.,Buddhism,cqb0aiv,2,t5_2qhnf

But his criticism was that I use curse words and my rebuttal was that I honestly dont think of curse words much. It is true that curse words hurts feelings but I have not called one person a name. You are the person who suggested I was butt hurt. Which I considered an attack. You are not following even your own advice because you have lumped curse words in a specific category. Meanwhile taking peoples arguments and bottling them up into one quote and saying Im butt hurt makes you a perfect gentleman doesnt it? Thats the thing with words and thus my original point words are words. All words can hurt. Even words like butt hurt and jerk. Yet you not yet offered one single apology while I have offered multiple across two different threads. Im not trying to get out of culpability or not accepting responsibility I am merely accentuating my own philosophy on curse words. I was answering in kind not making excuses. Most people do not even know the origins of the words they deem as bad words in the first place. They just know theyre bad. I dont really think like that. That said you are correct and I should be more mindful towards how I use words in the future. However be aware that because something isnt a curse word does not make it less hurtful and you should be following your own advice especially when using aggressive language such as butt hurt.,Buddhism,cqfvsyi,1,t5_2qhnf

3748891,0,t3_33am3e,There are a lot of great answers here and I just wanted ot add a cople things. But essentially its cultivating good and not doing evil. If for instance you want someone to die its an act of ill will you are feeding your defilements. In addition the root actions are all rooted in some deep ignorance. So for instance I used to eat a lot of meat now I seldom do but I feel I have moved from a place of ignorance to a more enlightened state of mind in my action. If it as a crime to eat meat say people feel I contributed to deaths I shouldnt be punished as it was based on a poor state. Likewise putting people in jail instead of killing them may seem silly but people have a desire to see justice done here and now. This too is ignorance as the Buddha taught about Karma and the fact that these people will suffer for their actions. To then wish a more expedient punishment is simply a desire to appease yourself and is rooted in the idea you dont believe the law of cause and effect as a Buddhist. Finally as a Buddhist one should believe that people are all able to at least get on a good course even killers were able to purify their karma and become enlightened. Therefore to just put someone to death is to assure them many lives of suffering to follow with little opportunity for redemption. A person still alive may see the folly of their actions so its a clearly more compassionate stance.,Buddhism,cqjlkki,3,t5_2qhnf
3749974,0,t1_cqj4lqt,The very calm state youre describing could be jhana!? Id think it would be jhana. Only the first sharp entry point into jhana is all bursty with saccharine worldly pleasure. Deepening it involves laying aside also being distracted by the pleasure of the jhana itself. Specifically if you take it very slowly it starts by dropping away first the buzzy burning noisy wooooooooo! pleasure leaving behind a big wide steady oceanic feeling thats still pleasant but in a more restful way then also as you slowly deepen it past there that broader pleasure gives way as well to a plain stillness. Whether you can rest steadily on the first jhana and keep getting that early bursty flowy worldly kind of pleasure from it isnt about whether you have the mental strength to tighten it its about whether you have the steadiness of mind to hold it at a particular point. Think of being strong enough to lift something versus having a steady enough hand to hold a heavy thing steadily at the same height. The steadier jhanas are more useful of course in general but its good to be clear about where the earlier ones are and how to find your way through them so they can form a steady base to build on. Jhana shouldnt be difficult if it seems to take you a long time to build up a jhanic state or its difficult to retain then thats about a way youre habitually preventing it that it takes you a long time to relax about not about generating the jhana itself which should take just a moment and be effortless. ,Buddhism,cqjq0zu,1,t5_2qhnf

3769256,0,t3_33k2bu,gtHow does one use emptiness to see through the illusion of the power in such thoughts?As the thought arises it ceases.If we have the thought I should let out the dog.First there is the I then there is the should then there is the let then there is the out and the and dog.Likewise we may have some image of the dog in our head and maybe even some kind of feeling of hurry or guilt that we hadnt let out the dog before.But as all of that arises there in the very next moment it comes to cease. Likewise how do we feel about the thought I should let out the dog.Is this a motivating call to get up and do it or is it something we feel guilty about and cry or is it a passing notion we dont give two seconds to think about or do we fixate on it and try to determine what it means about ourselves that we didnt let the dog out in time.If the mental formation had some inherent nature whenever we would encounter it we would feel the exact same way about it.Like if an apple had an inherent nature everytime we ate an apple we might find it is good. And so we would eat one after the other after the other.But instead of bringing us joy each time it ends up making us feel sick like weve eaten too many apples. Our blood sugar might spike we might even throw up.And so the thoughts themselves do not have any intrinsic nature.Why?Because they are impermanent.What impermanent thing can we say has inherent nature?If something is based in causes and conditions then as those causes and conditions change then whatever something we are looking at changes.We go from one thought to the other to the other or even into thoughtlessness.Now since thoughtlessness is possible what more could be used as an example that mental formations are impermanent and can cease? But as they can cease they can arise again they are dependently originated.So what do we do?When we have some feeling about a thought thats not constructive for instanceMy boyfriend cheated on me. How could he? I thought he loved me.We may have all kinds of adverse reactions.But we can see not only the illusory nature of the thought but the illusory nature of everything going on in that thought.The idea of our boyfriend in a lot of ways is dependent on us how we see him what we think of him. Whatever concept we have of our boyfriend does not match up with the boyfriend that actually exists. In some ways we can never really come to know the boyfriend that actually exists so whatever concept we have even if we think it is accurate is illusory changable dependent on our thoughts and feelings and sensations and so the concept of our boyfriend itself is empty and illusory.Likewise what it means to be in a relationship is empty and illusory.Likewise our feelings of being deceived are too empty and illusory.When we peer into their illusory nature understanding them to be empty then we can see them as such.We can see our concept of our boyfriend for what it is to us.We can see our concept of a relationship for what it is to us or for what it means to cheat.We can see our feelings for what they are to us our feelings of anger or sadness or frustration or confusion.And we can see the thought My boyfriend cheated on me. for what it is a discursive thought that has arisen dependent on many factors.We can see our perception of the whole thing for what it is our intellectual processes our attitudes and intentions the whole shabang.And what do we do when we acknowledge everything as such?Return to the breath.Acknowledge it and let it go.There is not a single transitory phenomena from which we can squeeze any joy or happiness from.The base of true joy and real lasting peace lies in the undisturbed nature of mind itself.So long as we place our refuge in external phenomena we are bound to suffer.SogtI know Buddha did indeed teach the essence of thoughts as empty but how does one see that even ones mental formations are empty?Take the thought to mind observe its nature. What is the thought dependent on. Is the thought impermanent? If the thought it impermanent what does that mean for intrinsic self? If the thought is empty what does that mean for our feelings and other thoughts and experiences we might have with regard to that thought? What are the nature of those feelings and thoughts and experiences? Are they impermanent? What does that mean for their intrinsic nature?If they still seem like they are existing in some way in what ways do they exist? Given the way they exist what does that mean for the appearance of them that we experience?Dig in get in there noone will be able to tell you a single thing to realize the empty nature of thought.You have to see it for yourself.,Buddhism,cqlx84e,2,t5_2qhnf

3925447,0,t3_35dbrk,In general to the best of my explanation there is a view in Buddhism that all beings have the capacity for enlightenment.  On the other hand all beings in general have the capacity for great suffering if they act in unskillfulignorant ways.From a Buddhist perspective there is the ... concept of karma that actions have consequences.  In general many buddhists would say that there is no being that is absolute evil  it is generally a mixed bag until enlightenment and instead of evil it is more ignorant  people that act out of selfinterest anger hatred etc really dont fully appreciate the ramifications of their actions on themselves as well as on others.In other words these terrorists are most likely planting seeds that wont be particularly ... pleasant when they ripen and you could argue that they are acting out of deep ignorance.Thus one can have compassion for them because they truly do not know what they are doing.I will mention on the other hand that this doesnt mean one shouldnt take action if appropriate to stop terrorist acts for example.  It is possible to take action even in a protective or firm way without hatred and ideally with a view that all beings fundamentally have the same nature.,Buddhism,cr3qjfq,1,t5_2qhnf

3961600,0,t3_35ua4e,So your assumption is that the Buddhist path is a path of complete withdrawal into ones own mind which is not the case.The Buddha was the Tathaghata the One that has arrived at suchness the one who sees things as they are.In seeing things as they are he conquers all the delusions of interacting with the world as they are not.For instance when one is mindful of the body and discovers one is hungry what is one to do?Retreat to their mind to escape their hunger?This actually does not address the physical suffering of hunger.They should eat because this undoes the causes and conditions for the physical suffering of hunger.Likewise when one sees a thorn in someones foot out of kindness and compassion towards them seeing that this thorn sets the causes and conditions for their experiential suffering then wanting them not to suffer cause they care about them so much they go and help to try to remove the thorn.Once the thorn is removed the being experiences the relief of nonsuffering.Part of right intention in Buddhism is nonillwill and part of right action is nonharming.As the saying goesgtIf you cannot help at least do not harm.At the very least there should be no harm done there is not an immediate call to help.But those moved by the compassionate nature of the heartmind will naturally try to help those in need.This is the difference between the realization of the Arahat and that of the Bodhisattva.An Arahat seeks to liberate themselves from suffering and while may be compassionate the goal is not to deliver all beings from suffering this is fine.A Bodhisattva seeks to liberate all others from suffering out of kindness and compassion for them and thus sets aside their own liberation to actively get involved in samsara and undo cycles of suffering wherever they are to be found and set cycles of reciprocal happiness and joy.It depends on your aim as a Buddhist some Buddhists take the more cessation path abiding by all the nons some Buddhists while also taking this path also assert the positive iteration of kindness love compassion empathy joy along with peace and contentment.,Buddhism,cr7utkj,6,t5_2qhnf

The physical cancer is not Dukkha the physical cancer is just plain physical illness. It is neither bad nor good in the context of Buddhism and universal truth. It is only when we label things good and bad that we create our own Dukkha which IS bad since this is actual mental suffering that could be prevented. It is a fabrication of the mind that is not real yet still causes great anxiety and stress due to our ignorance and lack of practice andor lack of attainment within the practice such as not being able to create long lasting states of Samadhi.Also I never stated that psychiatry  adequately addresses Dukkha but it does a pretty good job for most people in need that have a physical brain chemistry problem or actual brain structural problem which medication can fix.

4186812,0,t1_crwmfdu,gt Because this simply dilutes and corrodes the system as you are introducing nothing more than your own whims and attempting to meld them with the buddhadharma. You are not a buddha and have no business pompously parading your own limitations as anything on par with the these teachings. All that you do is muddy the waters and it is quite sad but that is your limitation to work with. Luckily I dont have the unfortunate karma to get caught up in your bullshit but there will be others who are not so fortunate. You didnt answer my question.  This doesnt tell me what the danger is.  The best I can suss out is some kind of political danger in line with iconoclasm.  This is just polemic nothing more.gtMadhyamaka Yogcra Prajpramit Mahmudr Dzogpachenpo and on and on... none of them say the mind is real or truly existent this is why your deluded view deviates from all of these systems and from the buddhadharma altogether. I dont think you can make that claim.  All the systems you mention put a huge emphasis on mind and make the mind their center of investigation.  They say things like do not seek Nirvana somewhere outside the mind etc.gtWell no my point on this matter is surely not that elementary. But it is.  All your points heretofore have been political in nature.  Youre engaged in polemics.  Youre talking about what is and isnt a proper Buddhist without any understanding of Buddhism in general.  You make vague claims and provide no citations when asked.  Whats the point?  Youre not an authority so you cant just say its wrong and be done with it.  Your words mean nothing to me in and of themselves.gtQuite silly. Indeed. gtThe simple point is if you take your mind to be real then you are deludedAll delusions carry experiential dangers.  If you say taking your own mind to be real carries a danger you need to explain what that danger is.  You cant just label something deluded and be content with it.  Youre no authority.gtThis has nothing to do with dogmatic belief and rather has everything to do with experiential realization which you dont appear to have.If someone does appear to have such a thing you are deluded.  You cant see from the rd person what can only be seen and experienced from the st.  The only realization that will make its appearance clear to you is when it happens eventually your own.  Thats it.  You wont be privy to anyone elses realizations.  Of course youre free to conjecture but all such conjectures about the states of other peoples minds are harming both you and other people.gt Sure you may meditate sure you may have cultivated some siddhis but neither means you are realized not in the least. This is why there can be yogis with profound realization and no siddhis to speak of and other adepts with a multitude of siddhis and no realization to speak of. All correct but besides the point entirely.gt Introducing solipsism into these teachings degrades the teachings and makes them completely sterile.Can you elaborate on this?  Ive been asking you this same question like countless times.  So how many more times will I need to ask you before you deign to expound on this?  In what sense does solipsism as a mental fabrication make Buddhism sterile as a mental fabrication?  Id like an answer to this that isnt you just have to stick to tradition no matter what.gt The fact that conventional truths are ultimately empty does not destroy conventional truth in its own context.The whole point of the ultimate truth is to eventually supplant the conventional.  The Buddha abandons convention entirely at some point.  This is evident when the Buddha answers Are you a human? with No in the Suttas.  The only reason Buddha appears to say intelligible and conventional things is not because the Buddha hasnt abandoned convention but because you havent.  Since all youre capable of hearing and understanding is conventional as of yet thus the Buddha appears in the realm of convention and says this or that conventional truth to guide and encourage you to understand your own mind.So relying on a conventional truth shouldnt be a happy reliance for you.  You should understand how dangerous convention is.gtErgo you are ultimately nothing more than a misconception and an imputation but that does not mean that the apparent characteristics that belong to you on the level of conventional truth are somehow mineThats not entirely true.  While conventionally we think the people are out there so to speak and beyond our control independent existing in and of themselves even conventionally we also acknowledge that what we know of people is our own image of them and not the actual person.  Thus two people can disagree about a third because the two may have built up incompatible images of the rd.  And this is something we admit happens even at the level of convention.gt Ergo you are ultimately nothing more than a misconception and an imputation but that does not mean that the apparent characteristics that belong to you on the level of conventional truth are somehow mine as I am equally unreal on the level of ultimate truth.Youre only unreal from my POV in the ultimate analysis.  I cannot prove that youre unreal from your own side because I have no access to something that isnt my POV.  Everything outside my POV is only conjectured not directly known.  So I regard you as an unreal vision on par with the vision of this body here which is equally unreal.Since I know how beneficial personal responsibility is from my own POV even though I cant prove to myself your reality for the sake of compassion on the chance that you exist as more than just a vision I have to use the language of personal responsibility for your sake.  In other words I have to ask you to take yourself as real so that you take responsibility for yourself even if you dont take me to be real.gtYour solipsism is a ridiculous view that has no application hereSolipsism is what allows you the authority and authenticity to fully relax because it puts what youre doing outside the scope of social judgement so this one source of grievance is eliminated from the mind and youre left to work out the other grievances on your own terms.,Buddhism,crxhxym,0,t5_2qhnf

4204540,0,t1_cryooci,Acceptance in Buddhism probably stems from the idea of noting and acknowledging the phenomena to which we have created aversions one of the three poisons.

By finally accepting that these thoughts feelings ideas whatever exist and are present we interrupt the experience of suffering through aversion to these phenomena.I think acceptance in Buddhism was always more of a meditative tactic to be employed against objects of aversion and repulsion rather than a writlarge tool.,Buddhism,crzia61,1,t5_2qhnf
4206497,0,t1_crz8zm6,I was diagnosed by a professor of infections diseases at one of the top Universities in the world and am having brain surgery to put a piece of metal jugular stent in the back of my head in a few months.  Im definitely very ill.  I can push myself a bit and read more than usual but it makes the brain fog worse later which is known as postexertional malaise.  Also the severity comes and goes in long cycles lasting many months.  Sometimes I can read  pages a day for a few months without making it much worse sometimes I struggle to read .  Usually I can manage a few but I will alway feel some negative effects just from reading a few pages and if I push it too much I have to lie down to recover.  My neuroradiologist thinks I have a problem with drainage of fluid from my brain.  I also have a POTS postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome which is basically where my blood vessels dont constrict in my legs when I stand up causing my heart rate to go very high causing more fatigue as it gets tired out.  Its thought to be part of the same postinfectiousfatigue syndrome triggered by the lyme disease.There are people who have are more severe form of CFS for sure Id say I am moderate with severe dips.I cant just exercise it off because that creates postexertional malaise where my brain swells up making the exhaustion symptom worse.  Its been tested with a lumbar puncture and found I have raised intracranial pressure.  So Im trapped in this netherworld where I cant exert myself physically or mentally without making it worse but as long as I hardly do anything at all I feel ok.

There are no cognitive biases in that the unborn mind can only be referred to expediently so but is ultimately beyond words beyond conception and thus is inexplicable in truth however when referred to as unborn mind is it referred to as so because it is not actually an unborn mind.

The chance of you being able help someone dying of starvation is actually much much much higher than your chance of preventing a mass shooting. Even from a utilitarian perspective it makes much more sense to talk about helping the poor daily than it does to talk about the unlikely event of being able to stop a gunman through force.Our Americans fixation on saving the day against an insaneevil gunman is rooted in many things including movies literature and politics but not on a realistic and reasonable discussion of moral dilemmas.

4426401,0,t3_3bqvx2,gt Social stigma I do live in a society that is generally religiously tolerant. However if I was going to accept the buddhist path as truth I wouldnt see any reason to stay a lay practitioner since this would only entangle me further in Samsara therefore causing more suffering instead of leading to liberation. Why do you think this?  You are not even sure if you want to practice Buddhism or not.  How can you possibly know if you would want to completely renunciate the householder life if you did make the conviction to practice Buddhism?gt My ego Basically my own ego is doing the same thing that I accuse my parents as doing. My ego is telling me hey all this buddhism stuff is just a castle in the mind youve built for yourself so you can finally flee from having to take on your role as a man so you can just stay a loser while calling yourself enlightened lt Was important to me to provide some psychological background on this hence the wall of text aboveIt seems too often forgottenand thus why it is so often reiterated by teachers that the Buddhist path whether monatics or lay people is not about retreating from the world at large.  It is about existing in it and engaging with it.  The moment you are fleeing is the moment you are doing it wrong.gt Doubts What if buddhism was wrong in the end? Yes it all seems very right and logical to me right now. But doesnt everybody think that about their religion when in the end only one can be true? Isnt the human mind fooled very easily? Or what if the monastery I choose was shit? I would basically end up comitting myself to a religioninstitution that has no inherent value.It is said that Buddhist practice requires three things in balance.  The first is Great Faith.  Without faith you will not put enough conviction into your practice to see fruition.  The second is Great Determination.  All the faith in the world wont help you if you do not have the determination to keep at it.  It is like a kind of stubbornness that you need to not give up or stagnate.  Finally you need Great Doubt.  You cant blindly accept the teachings of Buddhism.  You must accept that unless you see it for your self your belief and understanding will always be subpar.  You must see that your own teachers might be mistaken or that you may misunderstand their words.  So you must investigate with an open mind neither fully accepting nor fully rejecting the teachings until you see it for yourself.  Most of us here are dedicating our time to a practice we are not fully certain of.  Many of us have seen glimpses of understanding that have suggested to us that we are on to something.It really does not matter what world view you ascribe to.  Buddhism is about teaching the reality of our dissatisfactionsuffering and the cessation of all dissatisfactionsuffering.  These exist whether you accept them or not.  They are also perhaps the most plain ordinary and mundane of Buddhist teachings.,Buddhism,cson0zt,3,t5_2qhnf

You cant accomplish the same thing with a pill as you can with yrs of meditation. yrs of practice rewires your brain on a deep level.

Its considered a really positive thing to be a vegetarian. Most of us arent. But if you are thats great and it can be a source of a lot of joy in your own heart and mind. So that might be a great starting point for you.  The big point is you dont have to completely accept reject or even understand the whole belief structure of buddhism. You just kind of get started somewhere with something that seems trustworthy to you and then grow from there.By the way youd probably love practicing some of the metta or brahmavihara practices. They have to do with universal love and compassion and youll dig it. Also green tara is a form of the buddha thats specifically associated with kindness to animals.

Maybe Im reading into this too much and Im way off the mark but maybe something I say will ring true for you.I was a ball of selfhatred never feeling good enough but also continuously reminded of the supposed genius and brilliance I have over others. Schooling was so easy I was awful at it. I never did homework. I failed my first year of college because I never went to class. I lazed my way through the rest of college nearly never going but at least doing the work this time... and all my peers would get very upset and jealousHow the fuck are you getting As when youre never fucking in class?I can learn easily. And really fast. I can learn things instantaneously that people take years to study. Its rare that I meet someone who isnt amazed just by speaking with me by my intelligenceI dont understand it I think I speak like a normal person does. But it makes me so. fucking. lazy. Im not particularly ambitious outside of things I really care about. Second year of college I got into parkour became obsessed. First time I was exercising in my life and doing it all the time. It became a big part of my life. Lifting and exercise science too.Now what Im getting at is... and please forgive me if Im being too presumptuous when things are really easy for you when things are really intuitive and when you have funlike early on with piano I play jazz guitar myselfyou put in the work for a while yeah? Thats why youre so smart because when somethings new to you you absorb it. The novelty dies really fast though you get bored disinterested unmotivated lazy and move on. You can go to class and when its still novel you pay attention to.. maybe the first two or three lectures. Maybe you read a wikipedia article on it. Aaand.. you stop going to class after that because its all you really need to pass. But you stop going and forget about deadlines for stuff and you fail out because your laziness even made your lazy solution fail.You my friend if this rings true at all may have ADD. You exhibit the symptoms that are never reported because it flies in the face of what people expect ADD to be like.

Someone stated that people are the product of their environment. In Buddhism enlightenment is partially the understanding that what we generally experience as reality isnt the true state of being. Clinging to this malformed view is what gives rise to an ego. As such everyone grows an ego from before an early age.

4893524,0,t3_3huhb0,Its a legitimate question that Ive yet to find a sufficient answer for.  There are a lot of deflective responses in this thread but no one seems to be touching on one of the things thats bothered me for a while.If everything that arises eventually dissipates inasmuch our dissipation is already assured in the way that we presently know our selves i.e. our physical body our chain of experiences tied to our physical senses our mental perceptions arising within this state of selfvsenvironment recognition.  The problem is the notion that there were past selves and future selves all tied to the experience of this with a permanent solution seems to lose its foundation when everyone says oh no dont worry about it dont look for a starting point.Now heres the thing... if theres no starting point to be discerned one cannot be certain that the supposed ending point when reached will not give way to another indiscernible starting point to arise outside of its scope as it always seems to have done for an infinite span of time prior to the present moment.  In other words it creates in me the impression that enlightenment is essentially like removing a blade of grass from a field with the presupposition that there is an infinite number of seeds in an abstract storage house.  It then only seems natural to me to ask so why even bother removing the blade of grass in the first place?In other words if the sense of I could have arisen in the first place despite the Dhammas supposed preventative measures and it has a timeless beginning in a seemingly infinite number of instances the very notion of removing an I falls out the window unfortunately this is where all the assbutts have to make their presence known by saying things like You see there is no self!  Yet this suffering still persists.When looking into the infinite abyss of the past with a samsaric remainder still everpresent the Dhamma almost becomes a hopeless endeavor of selfdestruction for the sake of ultimately acknowledging submission to a selfproducing system of suffering which after really thinking through this explanation and suspending Buddhisms prescribed moral approach I find difficulty in distinguishing from nihilism.gt From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications.

From birth as a requisite condition then old age and death sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering.gt Now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications.

From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming. From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From the cessation of birth then old age and death sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering.Perhaps the Dhamma has already been tampered with.  Perhaps there is something more to this remainderlessness.  Logically things dont add up and in the here and now ignorance manages to persist and even thrive.  While there might be a time when it is waning and wisdom prevails it seems apparent to me given the infinite timetable the Dhamma has already been given to remove ignorance entirely that the complete absence of suffering is only a temporary state at best and something for which we seemingly have no chance of encountering let alone obtaining with any sense of permanence.Edit Perhaps committing to Bodhisattvahood with the stipulation of lasttobeenlightened is the only true path of assured permanence of the constant process of the lessening of suffering in that one is basically saying I will wait to become enlightened until all other beings both existent now and in the future have obtained enlightenment first whereby one will never become enlightened as there will always be more unenlightened sentient beings arising from the ether of beginninglessness.  When you remove the annihilation of parinibbana and acknowledge constancy has no place within our domain we all become beginningless and endless paths of inevitably infinite potential a potential determined only by the bonds of our present moral leanings desires and past karmic worth.  The cost is the assured suffering of existence either paid in full or taken from us in a debtors prison of our own making with no discussions or escape from the payment.  What if Buddha tricked himself with all of his wisdom into forgetting everything starting all over again his experiential path skillfully obfuscated but never destroyed from a state of Buddhahood to another beginningless unenlightened sentient being wondering Why am I here?,Buddhism,cubd98n,2,t5_2qhnf

4934890,0,t3_3ihb57,gt How do you deal with cravings and how to stop this mindlessly spending.It sounds like you are bringing up two types of cravings.  Physical cravings ie useless snacking on potato chips Mental cravings ie having more control on spendingOverall this has to do with the process of developing a greater sense of selfcontrol and not letting your cravings direct you around. It sounds like you are very much selfaware of whats going on here and that right there is a extremely good and admirable quality to have. Buddhas Dhammapada draws much on this dichotomy between those who develop this selfcontrol and living a happy and blissful life and those who do not being taken into states of misery and torment. Ever notice how if you offer meat to vegans and vegetarians or drink to someone who does not its a big stern casual wall of oh gosh no thanks? And if you decide to press the issue its just futile not a shred of doubt in their minds? How will you feel internally if someone wanted you to take back all of those things that you are getting rid of? Sort of the same? Psychologically whats going on here? What if someone were to deny meat to a meat eater drink to an alcoholic or take all of that stuff from you back before you had realized you would be better off without it? Trauma suffering and stress. So now it seems here you are done with the craving for material stuff taking a look at other harmful cravings and trying to figure out what to do about them. Correct? Very important questions to be asking very bigbig deal questions. For those cravings that you are talking about theres a certain hump that you have to get over. Thats all that it is. It works very much like quitting cigarettes where one finds resolve in it clamps down on that and that residual clinging eventually goes away. Why do they quit? They have their reasons and you have to have yours. Its still HARD no doubt about that but those things truly worthwhile in life are just like that. The reward is that life gets progressively happier and healthier immensely so with every effort placed in working away harmful vice and fostering practices in good virtue. As far as the cravings if all logic is showing that they are harmful to your interests the best thing to do is to deny yourself in satiating them. But then theres that residual cravy feeling how do you deal with it? This is where the hard part comes in but again its just a temporary hump. It does get easier. Like someone focusing on the foulness of drinking or smoking cigarettes you should direct your thoughts on thinking of the foulness of whatever that is. Marinate internally on everything bad and harmful about junk food spending mindlessly or having a lack of selfcontrol in refraining such things in general. You only get one life to live and you living it in happiness and bliss very much depends on getting this under control so its ok to build up an internal sense of urgency in attacking at it. In my experience on intermittent fasting on one meal a day as Buddha instructs for moderation in eating I find that although its HARD lots of failures along the way especially in the beginning but over time both that cravy feeling subsides and the internal fortitude to tolerate it builds. That process of building internal fortitude then helps in improving virtue in other areas like controlling spending habits restraining from wrong speech severing away harmful thoughts or emotions fostering compassion and empathy for others etc. Sorry if this is long. What you are asking is very complicated its hard to give it like a general oneline answer. Hope this helps.

When you put a live mouse with a snake you know that that mouse is going to meet with whats probably a painful death. Whats your intention there? Its certainly not the welfare of the mouse.You intend for that mouse to be eaten to die you put it in. You have the intention and you perform the action youre there youre doing it with awareness. These are the ingredients needed for there to be a clear cut case of making bad karma.When you give away the animals you know in an abstract sense that for those animals to live they will need to feed on live animals. And indeed if you give away those animals thinking may these animals keep on killing and feeding on other beings may many mice and crickets be killed! of course youre still creating bad karma for yourself.But if you give away those animals because youre concerned that youre doing something unethical if youre thinking this is tough I know that these animals will need to be fed but at least this way I will be less involved in the harming of beings from now on I will do my best not to harm beings then of course thats a completely different intention and I would say you are making good karma in this case.If you have the intention of nonharming and you act on that intention even if the result is imperfect its good karma.You can read more about karma kamma in Pali in the Pali canon here,Buddhism,cvj2cp3,2,t5_2qhnf

It posits that the aggregates and all phenomena in Mahayana do not have any inherent self an essential component that carries all of the characteristic of a particular kind of phenomena. There is no car essence that makes a car a car rather a car is really just a collection of parts arranged in a certain way. If we were to even have all of the same parts that made up a car but arranged in a pile we wouldnt even refer to it as a car. We would call them parts. If I were to ask you to point out what part of a car makes it a car would you be able to? Is it the steering wheel? The engine? The body? The Buddha explains that what we call a person is really just a collection of different parts working together. However because of the way these parts interact a sense of self arises. The consciousness forms an attachment to certain aspects most commonly the body and mental formations. But upon proper examination an underlying essence cannot be found.

Sounds sights smells sensations...theyre just all so distracting. You sit down to meditate and begin thinking of all sorts of things. Or you begin to feel pain here and there. Or you get uncomfortable because youd rather be playing some video game or maybe listen to some music...or really anything other than just sitting there. Youre concerned about your job your family money health leisure activities your looks relationships blah blah. So many distractions everywhere. And even when we know that chasing after certain pleasures is going to harm us...we still have all these mental inclinations to do so. Despite all the descriptions given of Samsara and all the analogies and emphasis placed on working to get rid of it very few Buddhists actually approach the kleshas this way. Im always thinking to myself how when some sort of pain arises in my body or when I think Im getting some weird disease I immediately begin doing everything I can to fix the situation. But when it comes to getting rid of duhkha I prioritise so many other useless things before it. Id rather watch something than chant a mantra. Id rather come on reddit and waste time than study a text. Yet I know I should be approaching this differently...but samsaric delusions are something else.

However my background being the dharma it is of course where I will draw influence.I think you should only do this as a public service thing and ONLY if you agree with your wife and with yourself deeperinside that this is NOT about Buddhism per se. You dont have the real capacity to teach the dharma by your own self description and you must  if youre completely honest  admit to yourself first that all youre about to do is teach a little bit about how to relax the mind in order to get the full benefits from the yoga instruction from your wife.gtThey all seem so eager to learn from me. Most have seen my transformation since I began to study the Buddhadharma and while I am happy to share my knowledge I am afraid they expect me to be more than I can be. Im seeing in this statement a hidden agenda maybe even hidden from yourself. I dont mean to be critical or insulting just honest. If I were you in this situation Id be very reluctant to pursue it. And if I did.. I would only do it as a precursor stage to the yoga alone. If you get started down a sideroad on this it could create issues you never intended. The key phrase in all of this is to keep it simple. If you get into the doctrinal aspects of Buddhist dharma practice even just a little you could be asking for more than you or your wifes yoga team anticipated. Without being a qualified teacher you are getting into areas that are at best nebulous. And in any of a number of ways might lead to trouble considering the situation as considered all around. When I talk Buddhism to other people I simply DONT PREACH it. I talk about it as if I were discussing anything else  like the new shopping carts at the supermarket or my new lightweight bike.

5434850,0,t3_3pgebk,from access to insightgtThe Eightfold Path is best understood as a collection of personal qualities to be developed rather than as a sequence of steps along a linear path. The development of right view and right resolve the factors classically identified with wisdom and discernment facilitates the development of right speech action and livelihood the factors identified with virtue. As virtue develops so do the factors identified with concentration right effort mindfulness and concentration. Likewise as concentration matures discernment evolves to a still deeper level. And so the process unfolds development of one factor fosters development of the next lifting the practitioner in an upward spiral of spiritual maturity that eventually culminates in Awakening.gtThe long journey to Awakening begins in earnest with the first tentative stirrings of right view  the discernment by which one recognizes the validity of the four Noble Truths and the principle of kamma. One begins to see that ones future wellbeing is neither predestined by fate nor left to the whims of a divine being or random chance. The responsibility for ones happiness rests squarely on ones own shoulders. Seeing this ones spiritual aims become suddenly clear to relinquish the habitual unskillful tendencies of the mind in favor of skillful ones. As this right resolve grows stronger so does the heartfelt desire to live a morally upright life to choose ones actions with care.gtAt this point many followers make the inward commitment to take the Buddhas teachings to heart to become Buddhist through the act of taking refuge in the Triple Gem the Buddha both the historical Buddha and ones own innate potential for Awakening the Dhamma both the Buddhas teachings and the ultimate Truth towards which they point and the Sangha both the unbroken monastic lineage that has preserved the teachings since the Buddhas day and all those who have achieved at least some degree of Awakening.

If you see the world with correct view whatever that is I think saying in nondual terms isnt good enough to capture it then you will spontaneously engage in correct speech without any need for thinking about what you should do.However the point of practicing correct speech is that assuming you are not already there we dont have that view and so we need some rules we can follow that lead us to avoid some of the worst kinds of wrong speech while trying as best we can to engage in right speech.The underlying goal is really to speak as an awakened one would speak even if we arent yet awakened.   We will not actually succeed in speaking that way but we can do our best approximation of it.So in terms of how to practice trying to practice by thinking of which kinds of speech are consistent with a nondual view rather than simply doing what the Buddha said to do is not a good idea.   If the Buddha had thought it was a good idea he would have taught that instead. In terms of whats behind the practice yes speaking in a way that is consistent with right view is whats behind it.

For instance suppose you cultivate mindfulness to the degree that it is present with the four foundation. If you end up telling a lie you may feel bad about it let it go it may come back to you a number of times you try to meditate nothing great happens you regret things you realize that your lying is causing you issues you dont lie the next time you see the result. In this case the precepts are not required you learn through your first hand experience that the outcome of your action is wrong you naturally disincline yourself because you know from first hand experience this is the result. If you hadnt cultivated mindfulness then you may have felt pangs of guilt buried it or say did something to distract yourself ignoring your sensations. Likewise Zens concentration of first hand meditative experience would lead you here and other traditions like Tantra do rely but not hinged upon great behavior. Beyond that the logic of virtuous action speaks for itself and in these tradition loving kindness and compassion as highly prized.Its just being a virtuous person is advantageous to your own future becomings mentally and otherwise and for a firm base for concentration.,Buddhism,cwm2lcs,2,t5_2qhnf

You can have right view and right intention but still need right action and right livelihood. The attitude and willpower overcomes all notion common in society is a gnostic fallacy. We all know you cant kill people without damaging yourself but it seems few realize the principle still holds for lesser transgressions against conscience and values. When our jobs direct us to unskillful management of our bodily efforts it builds up in our bodies as you experienced.As for the medication it can be helpful while you learn about your limits and shape your life. I see someone already explained that what I experienced isnt universal. I would also say to be mindful that the reason some people experience these things is because it can affect your whole nervous system. For example a sense of panic could be the bodily fight or flight response experienced if you were attacked by a bear. Such would be a bad time to eat relieve yourself have sex or sleep so panic suppresses all these drives to focus your action. Likewise medication that dulls anxiety can affect all these biological systems. At first I was extremely drowsy but then couldnt sleep had zero sex drive had weird digestion and hunger patterns etc. But it balanced out after a few more weeks after these issues had developed but then after some months changed into the zombie sort of state slowly almost without me noticing.

Its gonna go like this until the dharma ending age  where all the teachings dissappear .Enlightenment is going to be harder and harder to realize  it already is ! After a long period of time where there the teachings will be lost a new Buddha will appear out of compassion and will bring the teachings to light for the deluded sentient beings .Go outside and look around  and think again how hard is it now days to achieve enlightenment and how hard it was at the time of Buddha.Yes we are pretty hopeless right now  we are in the dark age .

I look around and the world is a mess people are all doing things they think will bring them happiness and only brings them suffering. It makes sense that this trend continues even after death. Eternal heaven or hell dont make sense because how could our finite actions yield infinite results? Annihilation at death doesnt makes sense because it seems short sighted. What caused me to be born in the first place? Rebirth makes the most rational sense for how the cycle of life and death occurs. Samsara is also extremely meaningless as far as the search for happiness in the context of a world of changing conditions. The Buddha had the longest term view of the pursuit of happiness Ive encountered. You perfect virtue concentration and discernment until you make contact with a deathless dimension nirvana.

Either theyre interested in taking refuge from desires or theyre interested in obeying it. Only their own life experience may persuade them to switch not other people. And definitely not on a scale as large as what were talking about.The only thing we can do is spread the awareness of the real Buddhism so those who have the seeds of sincerity can cultivate it.

But think it through with conviction in conclusion once you begin acting upon it it becomes your reality. In as far as thoughts go they drift in and out often without purpose andor any true understanding but I wouldnt go so far to say they are not your own not really. They simply arent thoughts you choose to take true ownership of. There is a subtle difference. But yes for all intents and purposes these ideas arent your own  so to speak. The defining difference is what you decide to act on. In other formats this is why we arent convicted of crimes in court for just thinking about doing something if that makes any sense. I had the most amazing dream last night. I woke up understanding how everything isnt really as it seems on the surface. Once I start acting on it in my life it will gradually become my reality. Until then just scattered dreaming thoughts like waking ones but while sleeping... Its what we actually act on with true conviction that really matters. Kill a bug by accident oh well oops!

Because if reality is not truth the unchanging rock in our lives then what else can one use a support?  Nirvana is simply having the insight to recognize and accept it and ceasing the search for another answer that will solve all your problems.All the buddhist practices lead to this same goal.

You dont need to buy mass produced eggs or dairy the cruelty in those industries is widely understood. To address your point about insects and rodents eating organic or buying locally can make this impact negligible.

Or in his reason for stirring the soup bowl in the first place? If my own consciousness creates reality can I really do anything that I can manifest in my mind?

6226193,0,t3_40uevh,I do find your article interesting and I agree with a lot of it but I have to ask what the alternative would be?For example I live in Canada.  Our taxes are collected by the Canada Revenue Agency.  They have approximately  people working for them and they impact the lives of every Canadian citizen approximately  million people.The system is forced onto Canadian Citizens there is no way to opt out.  If we made the tax system optional very few people would pay into it which would result in no publicly funded healthcare no public education no new roads being built no social programs and many other things that Canadians value.While I agree with you that some people would be better served by other systems and that this doesnt work for everyone I dont really think that Canada would be a place of less conflict if the tax system were optional.Just as one example if we didnt have the tax system being mandatory we would have fewer educated people.  Statistically speaking education is one of the most effective anticrime initiatives that a government can invest in.  Educated people are far less likely to exhibit criminal behavior.Add in that we have a health care system that doesnt require someone to turn to cooking meth to pay their medical bills.  Im sure that also reduces the conflict in this country.Those are just the big two examples though.  I would argue that in this case the fact that the tax system is forced onto Canadian citizens actually does have the overall effect of reducing conflict.

Youre absolutely correct that it systems such as this do produce lunatics and terrorists as well Im not denying it.But Im not convinced that the alternative actually has less conflict.

However this is difficult because the athiest sometimes thinks that God doesnt exist but the truth is viewed as a possibility atheists must acknowledge that the mechanism they used to get to this position doesnt eliminate this possibility.Likewise the religious person cant keep their views when viewed from the same angle there simply is not any reason to firmly believe this because although a creator God may exist you cant point to them. When both fail I tell them that we rely on our sense but can we even be sure that our thoughts or our sense are not the result of some type of input or that we are not in a simulation?

6248605,0,t1_cyzq131,Man these  second elevator pitch descriptions of schools can be very difficult. .Jodo Shinshu is not about achieving enlightenment in this lifetime in fact its about realizing the absolute impossibility of such a feat. At its core its a gratitude practice that involves realizing the great compassion that supports us in every moment of our lives and accepts us just the way we are. From the creatures that die so that we can eat meat or plant mammal or insect to the infinite chain of causes conditions and other sentient beings that bring us to this very moment in our life. We dont really do anything on our own without the support of others. Jodo Shinshu recognizes this and encourages giving up any delusions of selfmotivated selfcentered power in favor of relying on other power. Noting that its a fools errand to try to use selfpowered efforts to transcend the self and selfgrasping it uses power beyond oneself to let go of selfish egotism. .I cant really speak much to Nichiren Buddhism other than to point out that its doctrines rely heavily on the universal capability for Buddhahood and the theory of Ichinen Sanzen  the idea that all realms   the heavens the hells etc arise from a single thought moment of mind as well as the interpenetration of all phenomena. .The rabbit hole on both of these schools really goes much much deeper than the  second elevator pitch for either would imply.

6253671,0,t1_cyzhgqs,I just wanted to add something here because I feel that I slightly overstated the case when I said that concentration isnt the main point.   Heres a sample from the introduction to Culadasas book that talks about thisgt For both samata and vipassana you need stable attention samadhi and mindfulness sati.   Unfortunately many meditation traditions split samadhi and sati linking concentration practice exclusively to samata and mindfulness practice exclusively to vipassana.   This creates all sorts of problems and misunderstandings such as emphasizing mindfulness at the expense of stable attention or vice versa.   Stable hyperfocused attention without mindfulness leads only to a state of blissful dullness a complete dead end.   But just as stable attention without mindfulness is a dead end the opposite is also true.   You simply cannot develop mindfulness without stable attention.   Until you have at least  moderate degree of stability mindfulness practice will consist mostly of mindwandering physical discomfort drowsiness and frustration.   Like two wings of a bird both stable attention and mindfulness are needed and when cultivated together the destination is samata and vipassana.The introduction talks quite a bit about this and expresses it a lot better than I managed to in my previous reply.   The mindfulness or sati he is talking about is the awareness that you are cultivating which at first focuses outward and then more and more focuses inward.,Buddhism,cz0h3ex,1,t5_2qhnf

6274693,0,t1_cz2pxat,Devas are not something he said before becoming enlightened and then did not mention againAgreed. It seems that your argument is that once Gautama Buddha awakened he became a being with supernatural powers that no longer had to explore and learn  that knew everything. I argue that he was a man before and after awakening  and as such was not allknowing. He did not need to stop exploring and learning  Nibbana isnt the finish line in a race. You keep practicing before and after.   I believe that he had experiences that he interpreted as interactions with devas or used them skillfully to explain certain ideas. However neither Gautama Buddha nor any devas have interacted with mankind since then. Theres no reason to think that they literally exist as supernatural beings. If they did they would interact with the world as all things must dependent arising is a fundamental idea of Gautama Buddha and a fundamental characteristic of Samsara. Even if you argue that Gautama Buddha is enlightened and thus somewhere outside of Samsara which is close to being a wrong view so he cant interact with the world anymore then what of the devas? Nowhere does it say that all devas are enlightened and cannot interact with the world. Also if Gautama Buddha was allknowing then theres a lot of things he could have predicted in the suttas but did not. I know that you have faith in your argument but I do not have such faith. For me things have some reason beyond faith. When I read the Pali Canon meditate and engage in other practice I see that Gautama Buddha was a man of skillful means. I do not have experiences with him or devas as supernatural beings right now. He was an intelligent man worthy of respect  but a man. As time as moved so have the attainments of mankind. There are other explanations for Gautama Buddhas experiences that make more sense  especially because even if we assume that devas were once real we havent seen a deva in centuries. If they were ever real maybe they are all enlightened now and not on the Bodhisattva path which is why we havent seen them. Either way their existence or nonexistence or both or neither does not stop me from adhering to the path laid out by Gautama Buddha or from practicing ethics leading to a clearer vision of the universe in which we live. I dont want to hurt your feelings or to encourage sectarianism in rBuddhism but no matter how strongly you feel or believe that is not something that can change my understanding of the suttas or practice. Where you might take something as being literally true I can logically see how it might not be or is no longer true. I recognize that things change anicca and that its important not to cling to traditions and views that no longer lead to welfare and happiness in an unwholesome way. My explorations of the suttas and in meditation do not show me that I have a soul in direct violation of anata that gets reborn after death. I see that I have noself that is reborn moment to moment and experiences karma until that process ends because nothing is permanent. I am not visited by devas. So I do not superimpose them onto the world. I observe what is there with as little judgment as possible. If one day a deva visits me I will change my outlook and my mind but until then it seems most logical that they were used by Gautama Buddha to explain ideas  not as something literally true. ,Buddhism,cz2v18y,1,t5_2qhnf

Henry David Thoreau. Aristotle Socrates Plato. Gilgamesh. General theology.Im a bit of a purist. I stick to the story of Gautama Buddha as a parable. But at the end of his youthful rebellion Gautama went back home took over as king and lived in luxury the rest of his life. He also initially abandoned his wife and kids to achieve enlightenment. So he may have been a good ruler but he was still an oligarch so.. meh. At least Gautama doesnt command Buddhists to murder nonbelievers or anything even remotely violent or hateful the way the Abrahamic deity does which is totally messed up and is what makes Buddhism righteous to me. No violence. So for that alone Im a Buddhist.Ive studied a bit of zen tao mahayana theravada the  noble truths the eightfold path but its too religious for me. There is a lot of wisdom in these ideas but Ive noticed some inconsistencies with truths in zentao just like in the Bible and other scripture and now depend on myself alone to form my own truths.

6350849,0,t3_42mwct,My advice would be to stop thinking of them in such a utilitarian mode.   Women are really no different than men except that our culture gives them a different set of coping strategies and requires of them different behavior in order for them to be treated as conforming.   Eventually like we do they will grow out of these behaviors to a greater or lesser extent.The point Im making here is that you probably have a similar complex of dysfunctional habits but theyre your habits so you understand why you have them and they dont seem weird or dysfunctional to you.   The way to find someone who doesnt have habits like this is to spend a lot of time studying yourself and learning which of your habits are dysfunctional and then breaking those habits.   By the time youre done youll be qualified to have a relationship with a woman whos similarly accomplished.If this sounds like a criticism of you its not.   We all have this problem.   Thats all Im getting at.   Frustratingly our culture spends so much effort teaching us to conform that its quite difficult to escape this straitjacket.   The eightfold path is the recipe for escaping it.   Giving up women is not easy and isnt a requirement to practice.

6396173,0,t3_437ssd,gtAt my insight meditation class the other day my instructor mentioned that being a Buddhist doesnt mean youre resigned to be a pushover. He said that meditation can empower you to set boundaries and speak your truth.Very very true. Some people think they must be easygoing and facilitate other peoples whims and idiosyncratic behavior just because theyre Buddhists now. But in my experience Ive noticed if you do that youll get confused about your Buddhist innerreality being real or only a pretend thing. In being Buddhist we resolve to look within to make definite positive changes to cope with reality and the nonreality or illusions that many people will lay on you in life. I learned the hard way that setting boundaries is no easy task. You must be committed to establishing them and getting people to notice. I know a halfcrazy woman a friend who takes the longest time to understand there are places where she stops and other folks like me begin. After two years of holding the line she now gets it she didnt have a clue previously. She still tries to push that line back a whole lot and I almost dont see it at times. But whenever the tensions build and unfold I almost invariably notice that she is broaching the demarcation point between herself and me and typically everyone else as well. She has trouble with this and its why I say shes halfcrazy and usually angry and with no sense of humor. If you knew her youd know what I mean. She makes the same mistakes over and over again expecting a different result. And when that expected result isnt forthcoming she gets angry and lashes out at everyone near to her. People who know her well know its best to keep good emotional boundaries with her or else shell be pushing her problems onto you its not pretty. She represents the perfect reason why anyone needs good emotional boundaries. Without boundaries Ill be spending all kinds of excess time going around fixing her booboos it can get very extreme too. With other people there is always a foggy line where they might push too hard onto your emotional space. So with them good boundaries are also important. This friend really taught me that fact loud and clear. Im grateful to learn it. Robert Frost a famous dead poet once said good walls make good neighbors.

Human constructs are invented defined and created by the mind which means they are by definition imaginary. Take refuge in the awakening that ALWAYS lies underneath mental constructs. It is never not with us. We just forget its there very easily if we choose to cling to our emotional reactions instead of taking refuge in the silence by letting our reactions go. Keep the lightest touch you can on this world and all your thoughts and you not only wont struggle as hard to let go but youll also be able to live the least youfiltered life possible which means having a detached accurate awareness.

I wasnt trying to play down any of Buddhas teachings one bit they are what got me to my place in Buddhism right now this second. ..So why would I do that?  I was trying to differentiate what another to be unnamed poster was referring to by taking the phrase critical thinking in the OP and making a point of not donig the thinking while still being critical. I think thats a clear contradiction of terms as it was used and of Buddhism itself. In the Buddhaquote it seems kind of clear that Buddha was trying to tell people to make up their own minds from what they observed themselves not what someone else told them was the real truth or reality. It seems pretty obvious to me and it should to anyone. But there will be people who take things out of context and try to make a case from it. I used to do that myself a lot until I realized how important context itself really is in communication.On the other hand if someone comes along and says dont believe Buddha based on that passage alone thats just nonsensical thinking surely not critical thinking of any shape or form. My real purpose in my initial reply was to make a clear demarcation between the higher purpose of critical thinking which came out of many higher philosophical models including Buddhism itself. Buddha is saying use your own thoughts critically. ,Buddhism,czhrumj,2,t5_2qhnf

To get into that you really need an authentic teacherguru and authentic teachings. This part is no joke. For it is said that the one who point out the buddha nature to you is your guru and said to be the root guru. And its not something that can be done by fake guruteaching. Take note that at this moment we are entering the dark age. According to the buddha at this time there will be many fake guruteachings. So please be aware. Also becareful of fake buddhism cults.If you are new to buddhism maybe its a good idea to get familiar with buddhism terminology. Read as much as possible but dont practise yet before you find a real guru. If you can find a vihara try give it a visit and get familiar with it. Try to join a shangha group of people who practise buddha dharma.Hope that helps. May you realize the buddha nature asap.,Buddhism,czvoacn,2,t5_2qhnf

Problems arise when experience is traded in for conception. not sure i understand.gtThe experience has passed and now ideas are creeping in. The mind loses that organic openness and instead begins to cling to forms. Simplicity is lost maybe TMI but ive been hurt  some seriously many times.  recently ive tried to seek a calm that has always been a void for me.  this void  just reopened from an eternal wound back to the gaping chasm it once was.i had a tragedy  yrs ago that the ghosts walk among me  but yet ignore me.   this is story lifetime movie channel would not believeIve with great difficulty  learned over time the problem is the problem do not build on it by adding things that do not exist.  So I try so hard keep things simple.  Its something i grapple with on a daily basis.   The thing is its the same method i attempt to control the pain of my depression with.gtAfter something happens there is emptiness. yes but really im ok with that.  there are things that happen that you just really would forget.   you try to forget. youre willing to forget anything that happened around there just not to have that memory. i speak of other things for a momentgtThe emptiness looms especially large after intense events. Our habit is to fill in the emptiness. Avoid thatThere was a time i tried to fill the a void.

6545540,0,t3_45ah04,gt I get angry small things irritate me for example half the politically charged memes my brother posts on Facebook day after day. Silly I know but such is the way this are. I tend to get jealous and bitter of people and Ive always been sort of a pessimist.Ive noticed that when people are quick to be angered they are resistant to reality expecting it instead to conform to their desires. When reality doesnt go that way they unskillfully and unknowingly cause suffering for themselves through their anger. How often do we act out on anger and end up regretting everything we did. If you find yourself constantly being angered easily maybe you can investigate why your mind is clinging to certain expectations and what happens to the stress if you let go of those expectations and just see things as they are. Its not to say that you become a pushover. Instead of being angered and serving the interests of the self you can see things as cause and effect. Instead of good and bad there is skillful and unskillful action and you can focus on the skillful while avoiding the unskillful. ,Buddhism,czwd1im,1,t5_2qhnf

6572711,0,t1_czyyx2b,A teaching can be said to have  parts. Preparation Revelation and Transmission. A person may not be ready to just get smacked in the face with the deepest truths of the universe so they need some lesser truths or exercises to get ready to understand and accept the real teaching. A Kung Fu master doesnt talk much about the deeper parts of thier system to new students. The Buddha helped a lot of people by directly addressing what they needed most at that particular time. Later in his life when he had more advanced students he got into some of the deeper aspects of the minduniverse. And then he left instructions on how to preserve the teachings for posterity. The three stages of Preparation Revelation and Transmission may seem like just a convenient way to say your sect understands things better than another but I think it can actually be a useful way to break down and get a better picture of individual sutras as well as the whole of the Buddhas lifetime of teaching. Its not just for the sake of sectarianism its an attempt to  establish a clearer picture of the Buddhas intention and apply it in your own practice and studies. To continue the Kung Fu analogy yes there are plenty of schools out there who do teach incomplete systems because either somewhere along the line a master wasnt able to pass on the whole thing before they died or decided to only teach it to a select few worthy disciples. But that doesnt mean the practitioners of the incomplete systems are necessarily wasting their time. If they benefit from  the practice thats all that really matters. There are some folks whose karma guides them to Theravada some to Mahayana or Vajrayana or to Hinduism or Christianity or Hermetic teachings or to shamanic paths or whatever. Some teachings will be more or less complete or accurate but the important thing is how it works for the individual.  If we look at it just chronologically the Theravada teachings came earlier in the Buddhas career and the Mahayana later. Some say Theravada is training wheels some say Mahayana Sutras were made up after the Buddha was gone. Thats just the way it is. Its impossible to know the full concrete truth of the matter so its up to us individually to decide. ,Buddhism,czz68c6,3,t5_2qhnf

You might be in a tough spot in life. But theres nothing You can do but move toward a slightly better spot. Things just are how they are.

If you want you can take the five precepts at a Buddhist temple. They might have certain requirements. I had to go on retreats and join the temple to take the precepts.There is a huge amount  of Buddhas words recorded. One of his followers Ananda could remember everythingTipitaka The Pali Canon at accesstoinsight.org This web site is goodThis is a good place to start if you want a bookWhat the Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula.  The indroduction here is short but a good overviewThe DhammapadaWikipdedia is controversial on a lot of subjects but I think they are okay on Buddhism I often look up words and concepts related to Buddhism there. They tell you how a concept differs between denominations which can be a big help in understanding what you read elsewhere.There are many different denominations. I am Zen because the Zen center was near where I lived. I am pretty independent minded I read a lot I make up my own mind and I dont really take religious authority seriously which might be why I like religion when so many others nowadays hate it. I take the good where I find it and get what I want from it and I avoid deep commitments to organizations because any organization religious or nonreligious is going to have politics manipulators etc. Im a Buddhist because I think the Buddhist meditation and mindfulness practices are beneficial. I liked going to the Zen center to meditate in a group which is a lot easier than meditating alone. And I liked to hear the talks and get together with other people who had spiritual values and liked to meditate. The world is so materialistic you get bombarded by advertisments all the time and if you work for a for profit corporation the environment is usually very materialistic so I like to have something in my life to reinforce and validate my spiritual values otherwise I feel isolated. I dont necessarily buy into the Buddhist cosmology in a literal sense Im also a Spiritualist and I get my beliefs about the afterlife and the purpose of existence to a large extent from that but there is some overlap between the two. According to Buddhism everyone is supposed to get enlightenment during a human incarnation so you dont have to be reborn any more. I dont think that is exactly right. Also according to Buddhism suffering is caused by attachments and aversions and you can end suffering through meditation and mindfulness practices which help you let go of attachments and aversions. I think there is a lot of truth in that. Im not sure how many people attain full liberation but I find the practices are very helpfulYou said you are agnostic you might be interested to know there is a lot of evidence for the existence of God ,Buddhism,d02zn18,2,t5_2qhnf
6612870,0,t3_468p9m,Buddha never said there was no eternal self or soul. He was silent when directly asked if there was or wasnt.He did say that the body sensations emotions thoughts opinions etc were not part of an eternal self or soul and therefore were not worthy of being attached to.  And he explained why.He expressed this view because he wanted to help his students let go of attachments and aversions relating to themselves their bodies sensations emotions thoughts and opinions etc.Meditation also helps you to let go of attachments and aversions.  When you are feeling peaceful and relaxed you see you have a choice of becoming involved in turmoil being attached or averse wanting or disliking and you see it is much nicer to stay peaceful and relaxed.Dont try to force yourself to be selfless. Force wont do it. It has to come to you through understanding. Helping others is good but notself doesnt mean be a doormat or a slave. When the mind is quiet the ego is quiet and compassion arises.

An alternate viewgt Master Kusan of Songgwangsa used to say in his Seon talks that it was essential for Seon students to train in ethics meditation and wisdom.  These were the basis for any Seon practice.  Most importantly they had to be practiced in unison.  It was like a tripod with one or two of its legs missing it could not hold anything and was pretty useless.  In the same way one had to practice the three trainings together for them to be more effective.

6778121,0,t3_48hle4,rmykhathasnotail Since you are a regular around here and a Buddhist practitioner Ill respond via Buddhist teaching and personal experience. There is a telling sutta in the Samyutta Nikaya about nanda speaking to the Buddha about Sariputtas final nibbanagtVenerable sir since I heard that the Venerable Sriputta has attained final Nibbna my body seems as if it has been drugged I have become disoriented the teachings are no longer clear to me. gtWhy nanda when Sriputta attained final Nibbna did he take away your aggregate of virtue or your aggregate of concentration or your aggregate of wisdom or your aggregate of liberation or your aggregate of the knowledge and vision of liberation? No he did not venerable sir. But for me the Venerable Sriputta was an advisor and counsellor one who instructed exhorted inspired and gladdened me.  He was unwearying in teaching the Dhamma he was helpful to his brothers in the holy life. We recollect the nourishment of Dhamma the wealth of Dhamma the help of Dhamma given by the Venerable Sriputta.gtBut have I not already declared nanda that we must be parted separated and severed from all who are dear and agreeable to us?  How nanda is it to be obtained here May what is born come to be conditioned and subject to disintegration not disintegrate!? That is impossible. It is just as if the largest branch would break off a great tree standing possessed of heartwood so too nanda in the great Bhikkhu Sagha standing possessed of heartwood Sriputta has attained final Nibbna. gtHow nanda is it to be obtained here May what is born come to be conditioned and subject to disintegration not disintegrate!? That is impossible.Therefore nanda dwell with yourselves as your own island with yourselves as your own refuge with no other refuge dwell with the Dhamma as your island with the Dhamma as your refuge with no other refuge as in  gtThose bhikkhus nanda either now or after I am gone who dwell with themselves as their own island with themselves as their own refuge with no other refuge who dwell with the Dhamma as their island with the Dhamma as their refuge with no other refugeit is these bhikkhus nanda who will be for me topmost of those keen on the training.Similarly at the time the the Buddha had his final nibbana you also had his advanced disciples saying similar things while the less advanced ones  cried out beat their breasts pulled their hair saying  the teacher is gone from us too early. Do you know of the story of Patachara the Bhikkhuni? if not Ill link it to you its one of my favorite stories and she is one of my favorite monastics from the Buddhas time.gtI am totally clueless as how to process or handle this. If this is your first real experience with death then it is expected of course. You can be a practitioner and know what the suttas say but its nothing like the actual experience when it happens. Ive experienced sickness and death since age  starting with my grandfather through to the death of a wife and others after her. My advice to you is to be with it to let it flow dont try to cut it off cut it out or stop anything. Let yourself go through the natural process and USE this rare experience as part of your practice observe your mindstates and thoughts as your mind processes the loss. Dont let this experience go to waste. gtMy mind is coming up with ideas that this is the result of some of my past negative karma or that this is happening because I am supposed to be pursuing the Dharma instead of being in a romantic relationship.gtNow I feel as if that choice was a mistake amp his death was somehow necessary to correct that. I know this probably sounds delusional yes? Is it?Im ALMOST tempted to say I agree with this through my own experience with my wife dieing and actually a past girlfriend of mine after my wife who I had an on again off again thing with and one or two other women Ive had attraction to. Ive actually made the joke in the past that im a black widow haha. So the thought HAS crossed my mind in the past that my life is heading in a certain direction. On this whole subject I remain agnostic...What I will say however is this whole thought process of  he must of died because of kamma pushing me to practice dhamma is a very dangerous one that can cause all kinds of issues. What is happening right now is that your mind is trying to make sense of a senseless situation and is grasping at anything to find a reason why this has happened. If you are advanced enough in your practice to be able to depersonalize from thoughts a little I suggest again being the observer when these thoughts come up watch them see where they come from and why they came up watch them come and see the effects they have on your mind and watch them go. What happens to us in life is only partly to do with kamma there are also social environmental and genetic causes at play on this wide web of cause and effect. The Buddha also said that trying to figure out the workings of kamma is futile and leads to nothing but frustration we just cannot know. gtI am certain though that I want to spend the rest of my life pursuing the Dharma as best as I am able alone without entering another relationship.I am considering discontinuing my university studies I certainly will take a break at the very least.your mind will want to do it a lot during this time but my suggestion is not to make any actual plans or drastic changes at this point as you said you are still in a shock of sorts and need to go through a process  during which your ability to make rational decisions will be hindered. gtIs there anything I can do to help him at this point?This depends on the tradition in Theravada there is a tradition to giving a meal in honor of the person and to share merit with them. It is said that if they become a Devaheavenly realm being they can rejoice in your good deed and if they are a ghost they can benefit from your gift otherwise they have faired on according to their kamma and you cant do much for them. practically I say you can help his family if you had a good relationship with them now is the time to be there for them and with them as they say goodbye trust me I know setting up funeral arrangements and all that is not easy and they could use all the support you can give them. you can think about writing up a eulogy for the person as well and do good deeds in their name as a remembrance in the future. gtHow do I cope with this in the future? Again I feel more or less no emotion right now but I assume I will soon enough. How do I let go of him? Do I have to totally stop thinking about him or is it okay to look back fondly on my time with him? My relationship with him was deep amp it will be hard for me to accept that I will never see or speak to him again.my wife died over  years ago now actually as it turned out it was  days short of  years to the day she died that I got ordained as a monastic. I still think about her every once in a whilealthough over the years it has become much more rare and when I do I think of a being that I wish well in future births and whom i was glad to be there for the last few years of her life as a caregiver and friend to see her through her most trying time as she dealt with her cancer. you dont have to forget the person or push them out of your mind.  Your mind over time will put them in a place where you can look back at this experience and see how it helped you grow a bitter sweet experience of happiness and sadness of life itself. Letting go will happen over time dont worry about  how right now  continue to learn and practice the dhamma let yourself grieve and go through the process the mind goes through processing the loss of an attachment. if you ever need someone to talk to more about this through the lens of Buddhism or just with someone else whos had a similar experience email me anytime  jayanthaprotonmail.com,Buddhism,d0kl0v9,5,t5_2qhnf

6811966,0,t1_d0oetzz,I just wonder whether thats a bit idealistic. To date Ive tried to act in the way you suggest and it does feel like people just continue to take advantage. Not because theyre bad people  I recognise that they have their own pains and difficulties and are just trying to act in a way that will bring them happiness. If I keep trying to reason with them in a calm and friendly manner are they ever going to realise the stress that they cause me? Maybe it would be better to explode with anger once in order to show them that something has to change. On a more extreme level maybe the Buddhists who are being persecuted worldwide would be better off rising up in anger against their oppressors.Im not saying thats necessarily correct Im still trying to work it out. It just feels like a focus on mastering internal responses to stress whilst very important in its own right leaves too little attention for instigating change of external circumstances. ,Buddhism,d0ofm30,2,t5_2qhnf

6822250,0,t3_49736h,Dear foralloftheearth my heart goes out to you I can only imagine the burden you have bravely borne with the diagnosis and the loss of your SO. It is good that you are courageously voicing out your pain expressing it it is part of the healing process. It also shows that you have inner strength and also that you are accepting of the reality that you are in and this is a huge step on the way to healing.At this moment dont take up Buddhism as a crutch thinking that it can give you solutions to all your pain  Buddhism itself is not the solution Buddhism however is a guide that you can follow to your own permanent and lasting solution.At this point you are processing a lot if I were you I wouldnt neglect myself in order to study Buddhism. I think it might be good for you to take some time to know your body better know what is this autoimmune disease all about learn how to love yourself all of you together with the condition lets call it a condition from now on other people may call it a disease but for you its just part of your condition your reality. Develop a plan a pain management plan a life management plan figure out how you will live your life with this condition. Maybe certain diets certain medications certain exercises certain meditations can help you alleviate the symptoms  you want to take some time to figure out all the things that can help you. Once you have those you will then be able to manage your condition as best as possible. Once you have your life back under control then you will be free to live your life it will be a bit different from the life you used to live but it doesnt have to be any less rewarding.Once you have your life under control you can then study deeper into Buddhism and also you can think about how you can help others what can you do for others this will give you meaning and purpose. As your life is filled with meaning and purpose you will learn how to be happy with your life just the way it is. Eventually I am sure you will meet people who understand who love you for who you are with all the conditions that you have. And at that point you will know what you want and what to do.It is a long road and I really wish you didnt have to go through these pain but maybe these pain might be the incident that leads you to know yourself better that is your opportunity to understand what life is truly about and how to live your life. Maybe it is the darkness that allows you to turn on your inner light and inner strength. Know that you have many friends who wish you all the best many of whom you might not have even seen their faces or know their names but they wish you strength and courage and they care just as much as your closest loved ones would. I wish you strength courage peace and love. Do take care!,Buddhism,d0plmyv,26,t5_2qhnf

If you are trying to share an experience to improve upon others I suggest doing so if you have the capacity to do so especially if it would change lives for the better. I am not here to be relieved from physical harm the body can be remedied to a certain extent and it can heal by itself without intervention.

Once you realise the there is no point to anything the mystery of how it came about regardless is just incredible to behold!. Do you intend to do anything at all to alleviate the suffering of everyone else? Once the ego dissolves there is just life expressing itself. I no longer see any suffering or indeed see anyone else. However the is the willingness to do anything that may be required by others when prompted.. How would you rate your ability to help others? On a scale of what to what?. Did you feel like you were abandoning everyone while attaining abiding nibbana? While attaining? I dont understand. The realisation was that there was nothing to attain. However since that there has been more compassion towards and more time given to others than there was before.. I assume any sort of physical pain no matter how strong would not bother you much?It would bother the human today there is a stomach ache and it is grumpy as a result but I am not affected by that.,Buddhism,d0ulx9y,1,t5_2qhnf

Seeing that all externals are projections of Mind when they cease there is this state that is akin to a blip it is like a still pond as you said the thing with this state is that it is only when things return that you see the state for what it was.

6910272,0,t1_d0zl54a,I think it mostly has to do with translations. I believe when the pali canon was first translated into English and it stuck with that translation for a long time it phrased the first noble truth as life is suffering. The more nuanced versions of in life there is suffering came much later. It wasnt until China kicked the Tibetans out that America woke up to Buddhism and started searching for deeper understanding. That Gore Vidal quote is interesting but it certainly isnt about this book and Im not entirely sure which translation of the first noble truth he was referring to. To tell you the truth the book read as little more than a quick summary of Buddhism perhaps even for young adults interested in poking around the subject without having to wade through a long tome. Its certainly not the best book on the matter or a great one but the point of emotions are pain is still something that can be held as a truth. All emotions are reactions to suffering in one way or another though it does take a few extra mental hurdles to get to that point. ,Buddhism,d0zllof,2,t5_2qhnf

But the third purifying is sometimes forgotten in our regular view of life  it points to the fact that our reality is shaped by our perception our view etc.  By purifying that view as well as our sensory apparatus perhaps we start to truly see things as they are.When it comes to attachment the basic idea is that an overattachment to thingsphenomenaetc is not necessarily evil per se but rather it simply leads to problems and suffering.

Even today there are still folks in East Asia and TibetNepal who practice Sravakayana and primarily source to the Agamas though they are the extreme minority.So if you mean East Asian Sravakayana it has always existed. If you mean Theravadaesque in the rejection of other world systems rejection of contemporaneous Buddhas rejection of mahabodhisattvas aside from Maitreya rejection of womens ability to become Buddhas and chakravartins then the answer is because the Agamas do not teach that.The Nikayas and Agamas are mostly parallels mostly wordforword but there are huge differences in the tiniest little disparities one text having a phrase that another doesnt etc. And these divergences account for the differences in the Sravakayana traditions that existed.gt it seems like all forms of Buddhism practiced in China amp nearby countries lack any emphasis on the teachings in the Agamas amp instead are wholly Mahayanist in doctrine amp practiceThe Agamas are definitely taught in East Asia. The Mahayana sutras and doctrine take precedence but even in the Mahayana we are taught the Agamas as the foundation of the dharma. Mahayana does not exist and cannot make any sense without the Agamas as their foundation. There was never a huge movement to translate them into English until recently because of the Pali being available already and because when transmitting to the west its typically considered important to spread the Mahayana primarily but Buddhist educationparticularly the education of young childrenhas a focus on the Agamas.,Buddhism,d24etmt,8,t5_2qhnf

7275219,0,t1_d24hwja,That is one place the Buddha explained it.The Buddha also explained how the views of nonBuddhists about the Atman were not fully correct  so the nonBuddhist theories about the Self look like the real thing but are actually full of holes.  So to clear the field of mistaken understandings about the Self  the Buddha said that there was no self initiallygtO Bhiksus! Know that what the tirthikas say is like the case of a worm that eats upon a piece of wood from which by chance there appears what looks like a letter. Because of this the Tathagata teaches and says noself.   This is to adjust beings and because he is aware of the occasion.  Non self is taught as the occasion arisesgtSuch nonself is as occasion arises spoken of and it is also said that there is the Self. This is as in the case of the learned Doctor who knows well the medicinal and nonmedicinal qualities of milk. gtIt is not as with common mortals who might measure the size of their own self. Common mortals and the ignorant may measure the size of their own self and say It is like the size of a thumb like a mustard seed or like the size of a mote. When the Tathagata speaks of Self in no case are things thus. That is why he says All things have no Self.So the Buddha says that one of the views about the Atman was that it is the size of the thumb or a mustard seed or a motespec of dust  but the Buddha says that the Self is not like that at all.  Thats why the Buddha initially taught anatta  the clear the field of misunderstandings like this.gtEven though he has said that all phenomena dharmas are devoid of the Self it is not that they are completely truly devoid of the Self. What is this Self? Any phenomenon dharma that isgt True satya gt Real tattva gt Eternal nitya gt Sovereign autonomous selfgoverning aisvarya and gt Whose ground foundation is unchanging asrayaaviparinama gtis termed the Self atman. gtThis is as in the case of the great Doctor who well understands the milk medicine.

7495302,0,t3_4i15nl,I am very new to Buddhism as well. Having also been an atheist for the past  years or so and a Christian all my life before that. If you are like me you became Atheist because you had realizations or experiences that contradicted the teachings of Christianity. After having such experiences you had the desire to dig deeper and see what else you could find to be untrue. This all lead to the complete dismissal of Christianity and the acceptance of yourself as an Atheist. Certain things you have thought to be the truth all your life were realized to be the opposite and so began this process of seeking the real truth and undoing your previous perceptions of the world and reinforcing the new ones.Being atheist isnt about taking someone elses word for something its about seeing for  yourself. This can also be said of Buddhism. The Buddha didnt want us to follow him blindly and take his word for everything he wanted us to see for ourselves to my understanding perhaps someone else can expand on this. You see finding the truth isnt about asking others to either take or add validity to what you already believe. Its about exploring things for yourself to see the real truth. You cannot read about New York City and say that you know New York City you have to be there and live in NYC to know it. This is not how Christianity works or how other religions work and that is why we become so bitter towards them because we feel as though we have been tricked into blindly following something. Nobody is asking you to blindly follow or believe in anything in Buddhism. Simply study the teachings and practice with an unjudging mind and the truth will be revealed to you. If you find that something is not true then at the very least you have gained knowledge and as an atheist that should be satisfying on its own. Whether or not you practice Buddhism is not important but dont let your decision be guided by someone else. You must be the one to look into things and make the decision for yourself.

7514867,0,t3_4i9gij,When a car breaks down does the driver die?   The long answer to your question is that its not at all clear that conscious is not physical but its also not clear what it would mean if it were.For example physical reality and consciousness could have a dependent relationship without consciousness no physical reality or without physical reality no consciousness.   Its easy to justify the latter relationship because we see it when a persons body dies we never meet that person again.   Its more difficult to relate to the former relationship but if you think about it its also difficult to refute.Imagine a physical reality in which there is no consciousness.   Now think about what it would mean for us to assert that such a reality exists.   This is an interesting thing to meditate on.   I think you will find it difficult to construct a scenario where this makes sense as soon as you remove the observer the existence or nonexistence of physical reality is moot.But theres a third alternative physical reality and consciousness are interdependent.Of course this doesnt answer the question that I suspect underlies the question you asked.   Usually when people are concerned about the answer to this question what they are really concerned about is whether something of who they are survives death.   And with that we get into the question of reincarnation and rebirth.   Buddhism denies reincarnation because it denies the existence of a stable and independent self that can be reincarnated.   And yet Buddhism accepts the idea of rebirth the continuation of the set of causal factors that we mistake for a stable and independent self.So where do you go with this?   The answer is that you have to sit with it.   Nobody can give you the answer not because it cant be expressed but because it cant be expressed in a way that wont lead to misunderstanding.   This is why when you press someone who has been practicing Buddhism for a long time for answers to these questions you get vague sideways answers.   Its not because they dont know some answer or because they are trying to exclude you from the inner circle its because the only way to transfer the answer from one mind to another is through practice.   There is no way to communicate it simply with words.To be clear Im answering this as someone who has contemplated these ideas for a long time and has some ideas about them not as someone who knows the answer.   Ive gotten to the point where when someone gives a definite answer to these questions it feels very uncomfortable to me because its obvious to me now that such an answer can never be the truth.,Buddhism,d2weile,2,t5_2qhnf

What Im trying to say is that its a lot wiser to not raise such animals because we can eat their food and drink their water or use the land their food is cultivated to plant trees. Someone said that insects and other animals die in the process of cultivating plant food but those kills arent intentional. But food is a necessity. Vegan lifestyle promotes not buying things that arent necessarily for example tobacco and alcohol becouse animals are unintentionally killed the process and you dont exactly need tobacco and alcohol to survive.Also nutrition education and research  is highly funded by the meat egg and dairy industries obviously they wouldnt want people to promote not eating meat and not buying their products.

7632298,0,t3_4jtnbn,I dont think that there is a good reason to have children especially when you consider the massively overpopulated world we live in today. Things are only going to get worse in the coming decades and centuries world population is predicted to explode and climate change is going to make life hell for our species in the nd and rd centuries.I feel like most people who challenge me when I say that I dont want kids are individuals who have already had kids and just feel threatened by the idea that they have done something that someone else finds unnesscesary. Personally I think that those of us who are on the fence about having children should not have them. There are enough people that are not on the fence who will have them anyway. The world needs people like us who are willing to say no thanks in order to serve the greater good. And when it comes to Buddhism having children is  a hindrance when it comes to the liberation the Buddha spoke of. You can have kids and be a good Buddhist but you cannot be involved in traditional family life and seek total liberation at the same time. The liberation the Buddha spoke of demands renunciation from family life despite what many people will say thats not to say family life isnt a nice thing its just not what the Buddha said leads to liberation i.e. it will always lead to suffering so if you want to follow Buddhism completely you should avoid those attachments.,Buddhism,d39r1il,24,t5_2qhnf

Imagine if someone made a blog with the name what do buddhists believe and it contained nothing but a smattering of quotes strung together with claims that the Buddha categorically denied atman in all circumstances. Would you think that blog was honest? Would you think it had an accurate name that it actually described what buddhists believe?If you would object to a hypothetical blog of the same name but opposing view you should likewise object to the currently existing blog despite otherwise agreeing with the message it presents. Because in its current form the blog itself is dishonest.Second and related the blog is attempting to pass a specific narrative off as a single unified expression of what buddhists believe and trying to shift the burden of knowing that the truth is more complicated onto the people who are trying to figure out what buddhists believe. The blog is expecting that a beginner who knows little about Buddhism will know enough to realize its just one perspective and that other people have and do interpret the same material differently.

7838370,0,t3_4moagu,Heres my standard set of recommendations for Theravada Buddhism. If you are interested in other traditions then other people will recommend more suitable books.I think the classic book What the Buddha Taught is one of the best starting points there is. Its a rather basic text but at the same time it covers a lot of ground. Definately a must read. There are other more comprehensive introductory books but they are a bit more technical.Another amazing book is the Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhis book In the Buddhas Words which is an anthology of just a few of the Suttas along with some excellent introductory essays. This book is probably the best introduction to Buddhist scripture out there. This book is the only one on this list that isnt available for free on the internet but for a little over ten dollars Id say it is definitely worth it.The Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi also gave an introductory summary of Buddhism in the early s called The Buddhas Teaching As It Is which is quite good.His Systematic Study of the Majjhima Nikaya is one of the best lecture series there is in my opinion.You can find some articles he wrote here I especially recommend the article The Buddha and his Dhamma and The Noble Eightfold Path.Sutta Central is probably the go to place for translations from the Pali Canon.Heres a pdf of Mindfulness of Plain English a very popular and general text on meditation.Also one of the best books on meditation although it is a bit more technical is the book Satipatthana The Direct Path to RealizationIf you want to practice meditation according to the Mahasi Sawadaw tradition then read this pdf of Practical Vipassana Exercises is a very good book. Also if you are interested in the Mahasi Sayadaw tradition I highly recommend the youtube videos of the Ven.

Eternalism is then described as believing your personal ego is eternal. All of this directly contradicts the other translation and Im wondering if what happened was a mistranslation or deliberate changing of terms by any of the translators.

Nirvana is just the Sanskrit word for Salvation.  When salvation is achieved you wouldnt be born again.Think of it like this. if you do good deeds  sharing stuff you own helping others  you end up reborn either in heaven or on the earth as a human with greater comforts.  Think of a child born in Somalia vs a child born in USA or Europe. if you do bad deeds you end up being reborn as an animal a ghost a demon or you end up in hell.One is reborn to enjoy ones good deeds and suffer for ones bad deeds.  When you no longer do any bad deeds but only do good deeds you become a Buddha i.e. you will never be born again.  In this state all your sickness will stop and you will enjoy ONLY happiness.In Buddhism attaining heaven is not a goal at all.  Attaining heavens is considered inferior to Nirvana.

As when challenged the ego will act out as you can see she blames you as being wrong yet being are is seen as death to the ego so she or the ego will fight to keep alive however by realize that she will still be even if she is wrong will end this however its a self realization and not something you can point out if you do the ego will fight you. Be nonreactive towards your mother when she is in this state of ego you can see it so you know when to become nonreactive. The ego will burn its self out as there is nothing to get the negative response from. As from your point watch what you are thinking about when your mother starts to act out are you thinking negatively towards it making you feel unhappy or negative emotionally. By seeing it in yourself and acknowledging it there is negative thoughts in me you will stop these from connecting to the emotional response. Again simply become nonreactive to any negativity towards you if the ego has nothing to bounce off it will burn out and the person will return to their natural or nature state of being.        ,Buddhism,d42ds4z,2,t5_2qhnf

7921174,0,t3_4nry1m,I had a very similar experience several years ago. Like you I think a lot of the roots of the issue had to do with trust in particular broken trust between me and my parents and myself and my now exwife.In retrospect I had been hiding all of my flaws from everyone around me for years and despite serious challenges in every area of my life I was afraid to show other people what was wrong. At some point the incongruity between my inner life my feelings of hopelessness stress and unworthyness conflicted so much with my external life where I continued to try to project confidence and engage in constant activity in order to show that I was interesting and worthy of love got so severe that my experience of reality broke down completely.The unfortunate reality is that recovery from something like this takes time and there are no surefire ways to speed things up. I found a therapist helpful during periods but found it to be a source of stress and counterproductive during other times. Rebuilding trust which for me meant seeking out people that I still have trusting relationships with was part of it as was confronting some of the people who had broken trust with me or at least getting to grips with the reality of what they did.I was also a relentless selfimprover before my experience and found that the urgency had gone out afterwards. I dont necessarily think that this is a bad thing... I had internalized a lot of messages from childhood and the Internet to the effect that you were worthless or wasting your life if you werent constantly getting better or doing something that other people thought was awesome. Really a lot of this was just a reflection of my poor selfesteem which was rooted in that broken trust if you are abused by people who you trust and respect on some level you come to think that you must deserve to be treated that way and that only by being a better more interesting more accomplished person can you develop to be treated with love and respect.This isnt true. You deserve to be loved and respected no matter what. From a Buddhist perspective the Five Stage Metta Bhavana meditation has been profoundly helpful... compassion for yourself really is the root of all compassion and examining your feelings about yourself and your intimates is a good way to start to address those feelings of inadequacy and unworthiness. A therapist or spiritual teacher can be helpful here too in providing an external and more objective perspective about you to dispel the selfloathing.While its outside the exoteric tradition I would also add that because some of the issues that lead to my experience stemmed from trauma I found cannabis very effective in terms of being able to access emotions that had been walled off by negative experiences some of them from when I was very young. This method is not without risks and I would encourage anyone considering it to be familiar with the various guidelines relating to use of psychoactive plants set and setting have a sitter if youre unfamiliar with the effects etc. something like Erowid or rpsychonaut probably has more.Three years out I am much more grounded than I was before this experience and the feelings of inadequacy have slowly abated. Its also provided a lot of insight into my mind and been a real training ground for my meditation and mindfulness practice.It might be helpful for you to look into what people call the Kundalini experience. Really we dont have a good single language for describing what happened to us was nervous breakdown is kind of an older folkpsychiatric term though widely understood psychiatrists talk about depression with psychotic features but frankly a lot of what I experienced also corresponded pretty closely with traditional accounts of a shamanic initiation or a neardeath experience or the perception of the Bardo in the waking world.

7944845,0,t3_4o01xy,Ive been Buddhist since I was in elementary school. Im now an independent adult out of college and still deal with people like that. Regardless of age you will keep coming across these people. At first it was just people at school but then even close family and friends did the same. Heres some things to keep in mind when coming across these people   Every person is ignorant in their own way. In this case your friends are quick to judge and make rude comments about what you believe in.    Even if they have done extensive research they may still not understand because they may not have the karmic affinity this life to accept Buddhism.   You have the karmic affinity this life to accept and learn Buddhism. Cherish that you do and have compassion and feel sorry that they are not able to this life  Also there are a lot of incorrect explanations and understandings of Buddhism that people will read and judge based upon that Remember that people cannot get to you unless you give them permission to. You have to literally give permission for someones opinion to bring you down.      I always felt down whenever someone made a negative comment about Buddhism or the way of life I chose to follow. One example is that I do not eat lobster and crab typically because most restaurants prepare them live. I do not want to be the direct cause of their death because that is against the teachings of Buddha of not killing living beings. People thought I was stupid and and said ignorant things. It would definitely affect me in a negative way whether it be me feeling sad hurt or angry. But after awhile I realized I was being affected because I let those people and their comments affect me. I was adding fuel to the fire that was burning me by actually giving thought and care to their negative comments.   And to answer your friends statement about whether you should be able to pick a religion to the ground I do agree with your friend. I have done that myself. If you have any questions or comments or even if your friend would like to discuss Buddhism with me feel free to dm me.

Or vice versa we tend to blame the Dharma in stead of our own lack of practice for our lack of practice. Interesting trend really. Ive caught myself thinking like that too on many occasions. Cant think of many extensive traditional remedies for this particular obstacle although off the top of my head I suspect that our western tendency to want to jump straight into meditation in stead of taking the time to first deeply Take Refuge and cultivate renunciation is at least partly at cause. ,Buddhism,d4btb5g,4,t5_2qhnf

7980823,0,t3_4ojetr,Yes we mustnt confuse unpleasant with suffering. The manifest world has all kinds of pleasant unpleasant and neutral events. What makes it into suffering is our desire or rather our craving.An enlightened being is perfectly aware of unpleasant phenomena without losing herhis original peace and happiness.But on another note yes the very desire to eliminate suffering is itself suffering. Craving presumes separation one conceives of oneself as a weak needy incomplete being cut off from the Source of satisfaction. Without that presumption there is no separation and no suffering.The desireandsuffering of practice  of the Dharmic path  is unique though. Although it can temporarily be called suffering it is the one suffering among myriad forms that leads to extinction of suffering. So in this case the desire if properly informed by knowledge of Dharma and willingness to act in accordance with Dharma is in fact useful. So we sometimes distinguish this kind of useful noble desire by calling it aspiration.,Buddhism,d4d4bd6,5,t5_2qhnf

When we Theravadins say that all formations are dukkha we do NOT mean that this means that all of them are painful or that they lead to pain. The word Dukkha is defined to have three distinct meanings in the Suttas with the Dukkha of pain applying to unpleasent formations the Dukkha of impermanence applying to pleasent ones and the Dukkha of fabrication applying to all of them. This Dukkha of fabrication does not refer to all formations as leading to suffering but rather to the fact that they do not give true satisfaction because they are formed from causes and conditions.

Apparently Trungpa R.s reply was But then theyll never get it. Interpret that however you will but what I take from it is that if we use our teachers as a crutch in stead of as a refuge wed maybe be practicing something but not Buddhadharma. Its not our Gurus job to comfort us. Not always in any case. Ultimately their only game is to help us ditch our unawareness and our addiction to the kleshas.

8210841,0,t1_d53jwrg,Beautifully said! I hope you dont mind if I keep asking you questions In the past Ive compared the experiences arising in consciousness to those others have described. Ive done this as a sort of look at where I am on the path. Along with that rather than continuing to uncover the falseness in the appearances in consciousness it seems as though at times Ive taken on new belief structures more sophisticated and spiritual than previous ones. However I want to avoid inauthentic experience and by taking on new beliefs Im going against the very realization that the truth is in the knowing presence not in the external world. I suppose this makes sense given the path taken to realization was very direct and didnt follow any specific maps other than those that challenged me to look within for the answers. So my question is are you doing anything to safeguard yourself against taking on additional beliefs or fabricating experiences while following such a seemingly concrete map to full enlightenment? I ask because having found that realization streamentry is the end of the search but really just the beginning of the journey Ive natural been drawn lately to material that deals with postenlightenment for example the Advaita Bodha Deepika  or Ashtavakra Gita  Despite being very cognizant of the limitations of such material while reading and recognizing that its just the beliefs and descriptions of other people who have taken the path its difficult to completely avoid adopting ideas about whats coming next or what I should be aiming for. Of course its all just happening and not a problem even this conversation is just a continuation of the karmic conditioning present since birth. But obviously theres a pull to want to authentically live the truth in every moment so I suppose Im asking how you are doing that while also seemingly following such a rigid belief structure as that laid out in Buddhism?Thank you so much for your time.

They are not conflicting teachings they are one and the same though I speak from the perspective of the tathagatagarbha which is ones true nature rather than from the perspective of the skhandas. Attaching to teachings that are only for understanding thoughtconstruction which is what all the skhandas are form feeling perception volition and consciousness these are to be understood for what they are finite inconstant stressful and limited then and only then can one see what is infinite and beyond all dualities and discriminations. Nothing I say has to do with the absorptions of nothingness nor of the absorption of neither perception or nonperception. It has only to do with the absorption of Bodhi which is something one reaches through following the path. The fact that you see the teachings of sravakas as subtle and deep but the teaching of bodhisattvas which involve understanding ones true nature the tathagatagarbha and buddhanature this shows that youd rather cling to pseudobliss of the intellect that clings to views it finds intellectually stimulating rather than completely forgoing the intellect and abiding in the peaceful repose of bodhi. Good luck. It may be a long path. Edit In other words you seem content to cling to the words of philosophers that came after the buddha rather than looking to the buddhas own words which alone will show you the full path. Instead youve attached to the interpretations of others not realizing that it is interpretation that poisons the mind for the infinite has no interpretation interpretation can only occur in the finite and that which is merely a thoughtconstruction. You cling to an interpretative response and say I have nothing to attain it is all emptiness But this is due to an intellectual interpretation not one from direct experience where you alone will realize wisdom within. ,Buddhism,d5yc3bh,3,t5_2qhnf

If the noun is kyo body then the adjective would need to be anicco or dukkho. If the noun is dhamm phenomena then the adjective would be anicc or dukkh.So theres no difference between anicca and anicca except in the context of an actual Pli sentence.

The word generally used in english to describe this behavior is guilt.   Telling me that guilt means the same thing as shame doesnt add anything to the conversation because Im talking about the concept that I mean to refer to by using the word guilt not debating the meaning of the word guilt.This conversation is actually a classic example of why the distinction is important.   If you think that making a mistake makes you a bad person then you will insist that you didnt make a mistake because you are attached to not being a bad person.   If you think that mistakes are ordinary things that happen to everyone and that the best you can do is try to avoid them and try to correct them when you notice them then you will have no problem admitting when you are wrong because doing so is a relief.So in other words guilt motivates you to behave unskillfully.   Shame motivates you to behave skillfully.   They are different concepts.

Than Geoff explained that forgiveness is something you do for yourself when you can to let go of the past to let go of an old identity and that opens you to seeing how pervasive dukkha is. Reconcilation is something else entirely and must not be done until the perpetrator sees their error and truly realistically apologizes. Even then reconciliation may be unwise. Putting yourself at risk in the name of compassion is not the path. Good luck to you.

This can backfire if you are not prepared for it.  It takes a lot of courage and resolve if you wish to do this.  I highly advise against proceeding without a teacher.

8643786,0,t1_d6m0pfy,Well I suppose that I am just skeptical of people who read Watts and D.T. Suzuki and think that by merely reading these texts they understand BuddhismZen. Zen Buddhist or notis a very welldefined tradition that involves years and years of meditative practice with a teacher in a very controlled setting. This is true in both the Rinzai and Soto schools and is a nonnegotiable aspect of Zen practice. All Zen teachers will tell you this. In fact the teacher aspect is way more emphasized in Zen than in Theravada which I practice.I just find it difficult to take seriously people who proclaim with certainty what Zen is or is not when they have not even practiced Zen as it has been practiced for hundreds of years that is a formal practice with a teacher who has received the Dhamma through hisher teacher.Beat Zen rejects the notion of there being a particular practice that one should follow and believes that Zen says anything goes because everything is Zen. I really think this is an incredible misinterpretation of Zen Buddhism that can be traced to the introduction of Zen in the s and s when counterculture dominated the Western USA. I studied Zen for  years before I went to Theravada and I never saw any suggestion that Zen was about do whatever you want because its all Zen baby.  That said I think this Beat Zen is right for some people. I think that most people in the West are not ready to take on the intense Buddhist or Zen practice that is traditionally used to achieve Nibbana or for Zen people satori.I do however think its not proper for those people to suggest that they are teaching the same thing that Gautama Buddha taught.,Buddhism,d6m314r,3,t5_2qhnf

8794970,0,t1_d750j3k,Now about your questionsThey are a priori. Which if i have understood it correctly means that we dont know them to be true. It means they are based on theoretical deductions or are otherwise already given in a way not directly determined by empirical observation. But that does not mean we do not have good reasons to believe at least some of them to be pretty reliable paper on the unreasonable effectiveness of math   my point .a above. If you exclude deductive reasoning from your epistemology you cannot even draw any empirical conclusions either. The term truth imho seems to be more a feature of propositional statements than belonging to actual physical entities. But there might be ways in which we verify themsystemically Reschers proposal in The Price of an Ultimate Theory is to dualize the concept of explanation so that a fact can be explained either derivationally by the premises which lead to it or systemically by the consequences which follow from it. With derivational explanation a fact t is explained when it is subsumed by some prior more fundamental fact t. With systemic explanation t is explained when it is a best fit for its consequences where fitness is measured by uniformity simplicity connectedness and other criteria conducive to systemic integration. Rescher concludes that while a theory of everything cannot be explained derivationally since no deeper explanation can subsume it it can be explained systemically by its capacity to integrate its consequences.You get results interpret them and can then decide whether the hypothesis remains in the basket of scientific truth or has been falsified. And when does the falsifiability stop? Just because you decide so? Failed falsification is no proof the truth you come up with is as conditional as the truths in other fields. About interpretation you can argue as well Does quantum mechanics falsify determinism!? Many people disagree on that point. And as Poincar has shown in his Science and Method there might even be timedependent issues leading us to take variable things as constants and thereby mistaking them for eternal physical laws. An issue which according to him could not just be resolved by recourse to plain empiricism.Is there a method to arrive at moral truths which is comparable to the scientific method which is a method to arrive at scientific truths It seems you are asking for the definiteness of result. First there are many more methodologies around like for the different sciences   and as is appropriate for the larger possibility space of ethics and philosophy in general being quasi even more undertedermined than science see underdeterminition problem  But given issues with empirical evidence like mentioned above and below falsification  the larger possibility space of metaethics and ethics etc etc and the actual definiteness of a priori ways of reasoning thats principally not much of an issue. Just practically for obvious reasons e.g. amount of people trained well etc etc needed amount of time needed costs vs economical benefits derived.Scientific methodologies only produce truths that are both provisory and just as conditional as other kinds of truths. Hypothetically no matter how much reason we have to believe otherwise further experimental or empirical evidence might overturn what we believed to be true.  In maths if we take the same mathematical axioms given enough time and the same tools codifications etc etc I should arrive at the same results as you as far as specific questions are concerned I never saw someone prove natural numbers finite. Something similar holds true for ethics and most of philosophy. Having to learn the specific kinds of reasoning etc is no argument against philosophy the same way the counterintuitiveness of proper experimental design is no argument against science. Disagreement about methods is not much different than disagreement on whether to ground mathematics in set theory category theory or type theory or whether to ground geometry in Euclidian ways or not. It is also to be dealt with in similar ways. And like with geometry all options can be explored. But there are of course practical problems The time of training philosophers the amount of people actually interested in that the large space of possible answers see points  and  in post  or skip to the next answer below and low payment Btw philosophical statements can be supported or falsfified by empirical evidence as well once you made your defintions etc explicit and your statement extensional enough see my link above to the askphil question about general explanations for religious faith so given proper application of methodology and peer review of answers to certain questions those answers end up being answered in very definite ways. Also this multiheaded nature of ethics philosophy etc might just be a symptom of the extremely large possibility space. I will give arguments for that below.In math we can also easily do that. You have a conjecture which you try to prove. Once you have proven it using sound mathematical methods its proven as mathematically true. And like with the different geometries one can create one can do the same with ethical systems once methods and axioms have been sufficiently made explicit. To decide about which kinds of choices we have to make we go meta as in metaethics. But given the vast space time of training payment etc we do not have enough people to survey this empirically less determined space. So ethics and philosophy end up being like a more common language based multiheaded hydra versions of math and in its final forms or the forms of those heads some questions are answered empirically and some heads are slain. Making specific parts of language more rigorous like maths does does not necessarily change their nature of course math also extends what we can say. Anyway maybe that analogy of ethics and philosophy being like a multiheaded propositional maths whose heads might be reduced ultimately given enough time and work helps a bit. But for very specific questions once all stuff been specified people following proper procedure will always get very definite answers. Do we have something like that for ethics? You put a statement into the grinder of the ethical method and then you arrive at a conclusion which tells you whether it is true or false? Its really not that different from maths. See e.g. Kaysers statements in his book philosophy of mathematics regarding Spinozas hypotheticodeductive system however much we disagree with the system or the Dutchmans assessments of his own success. The possibility space is larger there is metaethics with the same issues about what kind of method to use etc but once you decide on your choices you can and will reach very definite answers. Even in science people are arguing about epistemic standards and whether some forms of string theory count as science see Smolin Woit and their opponents arguing scientific methodology needs to be updated to fit our times and situation.In the end this argument comes down to a simple plea Please show me how to arrive at a moral truth. Or how to distinguish a moral truth We shall not kill from a moral falsehood We shall kill. Who said we shall not kill is even a moral truth? It seems you are focused on religious approaches here. Maybe a better choice would be when we ought to kill or not to kill depends on further factors. Then introduce more specific examples and arguments. Etc etc. Lets take something used to argue against naive forms of utilitarianism. To maximize well being and minimize suffering should we transform people into maximum happiness blobs if possible? Of course this would be nonsense imho. But why? We might quickly see there are more things we care about which in specific situations override this supposed imperative to maximize wellbeing defined in whatever hedonistic biologistic etc ways. Which given possible normative justifications for us upholding that alleged imperative might leave us without any good reason to actually do so. Or it leads to more specific reformulations of our position. This is not really my area of interest and for actually making explicit and arguing a claim well I would have to produce the equivalent of a paper here. Maybe there is some specific issue you care about for which you could find such a paper? They are only  pages long most of the time. But lest you think that blob example is a strawman there are people e.g. on less wrong relatively wellknown online community Sam Harris  etc etc arguing for things that ultimately would go into such directions if taken to their logical conclusion. ,Buddhism,d751bh0,1,t5_2qhnf

8904983,0,t3_528trq,Hi there I think I might be qualified to answer something I had a similar situation with being a university lecturer. I always wanted to do it but as I got close I felt terrible anxiety. I always found it hard to speak up in class now I had to deliver a lecture to  people?The good news was it was much easier than I thought. I found as soon as I had the hat of being a registered anything it gave me a confidence I couldnt have predicted. And it made others treat me with a different type of respect also. It was doubly easier. Bizarrely I was able to walk out on that stage on day  and give a relaxed joking lecture when as a student I wouldnt ask my neighbor in that lecture for a pen. Now if a teenager is misbehaving on a train I can yell at him in a teacher voice that makes him do what hes told. The shift was remarkable. There are other tricks to overcoming social anxiety public speaking classes chewing gum even drugs before something that makes you nervous accepting your anxiety as the video at the top of this subreddit talks about right now... but for me they werent necessary. As for the baking. Youre allowed to do whatever you like of course if you can find it. But Id only compare baking to anxiety free social work because youre going to be able to do that. Heck youre going to become a jaded old social worker and a jaded old baker if you go down those paths... so take anxiety out of the equation when choosing. Similarly baking will have its anxieties at first.If you still want to do baking Id suggest a middle way. Start on the social work more guaranteed income and do a little baking on weekends. See if your stuff can sell in one or two stores perhaps. See if you like it. It takes a while to build anything up to a level of success  businesses sometimes take  years to bring in a decent profit.

If the rule were solely directed at the first conflict it seems the obvious choice was to say simply dont teach dhamma in private. The solution being to teach women only less than  or  lines and only in the company of a learned man seems to make it as difficult as possible for a monk to teach a women especially a woman of one of the lower castes to whom a learned man would not have been available.

9013484,0,t1_d7v98ss,This! But the question what is love? always seems a great way for me. Ask yourself that question and say in your mind whatever comes. You might think nah I made that up! but just go with it and in time you will be surprised.Here is an example. Earlier I was walking my dog thinking about a place around  miles away I had spotted on a map. Theydon Bois in Essex. A wierd sounding town which is why it stood out... in the UK not France like the name would suggest. Anyway there I am walking my dog and we go past a parked car and I notice the window is open at the back. Firstly I think...mind my own business but that voice in my head tells me Go and knock on the door tell them!. So I follow its suggestion and guess what the house is called? Theydon.Mind. Blown.You could call this pure coincedence but it is a hell of one. Image of streetview of the house would be pretty hard for me to make this up then find a streetview that matched the housenameI often talk to this inner voice. And the best question I have found I actually read about someone else doing this book   is What is love? I will immediatly get something back like Love is everything the birds to the bees to the trees that enable you to breathe...everything is Love.So for you just ask What is love? and say to yourself what comes then ask What am I? and say whatever comes. It doesnt always come in thought for some people it can be sound or an image or an imagined scene for me it was images but I slowly managed to convert that to thought because images can be misinterpreted. It is funny because tell some random you talk to yourself...hello mental asylum. But everyone has this power within and in my and the author of that book and many others experience this... voice... can read the future. But you cant say stuff like what are the winning lottery ticket numbers tomorrow? it doesnt work like that.The more you practice meditation and the more you practice visualisation of your goals  wants  needs the more in tune it gets.,Buddhism,d7va3t1,1,t5_2qhnf

9035277,0,t1_d7xv8fi,gt Your nature doesnt go anywhere. You dont have to go find it.  In the buddhadharma one must awaken to recognize their nature and due to past habitual patterns the experiential knowledge that ensues from said recognition will be unstable and will once again be obscured. The point of practice is then to continually recognize ones nature and extend those periods of equipoise until equipoise and postequipoise merge.  So it does not matter that ones nature does not go anywhere Buddhism is not concerned with that nature in itself Buddhism is concerned with a direct and experiential knowledge of that nature. Which is absent in normal sentient beings is intermittent in practitioners and is always the case for Buddhas.  This is how Buddhism works.

But just so were clear no one in this thread has endorsed that view of karma or attributed it to Buddhism.Karma is complicated and there are lots of reasons to object to it... but if the objection is karma says that people who suffer deserve to suffer then you should know that Buddhism absolutely does not put forward this view. From my earlier postgt The argument would not be that Person X in Honduras was a bad person in a previous life and is now paying for it through poverty. The outlook is more that every one of us has lived an infinite number of lives we have all been murderers and samaritans and kings and paupers with all actions carried out by all beings throughout all of time having an effect.gt From a practical ethical perspective the value of karma is typically expressed in terms of Show compassion and mercy for everyone because you have undoubtedly been in their position at some point and your sense of separateness from them is an illusion as opposed to Yes its very sad that man is homeless but he must have been very bad in a past life so thats not my problem.

What happens when you really want some tasty food but there is only something bland and boring around?Those situations are really uncomfortable. Thats suffering.One can minimize that discomfort by simply never indulging. When you never had a drink you suffer less from an absence of alcohol than an alcoholic. Someone who had a diet of rice and vegetables all his life will hardly suffer when Burger King is unavailable for a day.Furthermore indulgence can easily lead to delusion.I cant be happy unless I drink every day an alcoholic might say. After he stops drinking he might recognize that without being dependent on drink for happiness life is better. I cant be happy without unhealthy junk food someone else might say. There are too many fitness buffs to count who started from there and have changed their opinion after abstaining for a while.Giving in to sensual desires almost inevitably produces delusion Without this I will be unhappy and Only with this I can be happy are the two most obvious hindering beliefs which indulgence in sensual desire nurtures.It stands in direct contrast to the central message of Buddhism Happiness can be found in the unconditioned independent from having this and not having that.,Buddhism,d8u5w77,3,t5_2qhnf

9330869,0,t3_589ziv,Well the th precepts may be generally followed especially during  Uposatha or Lunar observation days days meant to renew ones personal devotion to enlightenment or personal betterment.So the th precepts are not in themselves much of anything but are part of a combined effort to to expand ones awareness or spiritual integrity. Thus the th precepts are meant to avoid mental or psychological obstructions which may hinder or inhibit personal progress and development towards enlightenment. So I advice against dressing in the most unaesthetic clothing and expecting personal enlightenment because of it. Actually you could wear the exact same clothes that you do have assuming that they are not scandalous. By scandalous I mean the type of clothing which usually attracts sexual attention if you are woman or which denotes or expresses a rebellious mentality if you are man. Thus adhering to the Buddhist notion of peace nonresistance and austerity. The key note is attitude. You can wear  dollar jeans from a thrift shop and be vain about its aesthetics or name brand and you can also wear  dollars jeans with the peaceful acceptance of Buddhist who cares not about materialism but simply recognizes the fact that some clothing is more durable and comfortable to wear than others.The purpose of that precept I belief is to cease emotional attachments to unhealthy attitudes not things per say. It is completely fine and reasonable to wear perfume and smell nice because in all honesty it may make the world a better place for those around you. However wearing perfume with the vain presumption that it means an exaltation or betterness over other people is delusion and something which the Uposatha may be designed to cease and dissolve.So you can wear the exact same clothing you usually wear while upholding the th precept so as long as you it is reasonably not obviously meant to attract attention. And yes I am fairly certain you are allowed to use a mirror.TLDRThe th precepts are not rules or laws they are the means or the path to some goal or end which may be personal development or enlightenment.The purpose of that particular precept may be to cease emotional attachments to materials such as fabric but also to cease the emotional attachment to the feelings approval or attentions of others. Wearing humble clothing which you feel uncomfortable wearing  for the sake of pleasing or seeking approval of Buddhists  as unproductive as wearing extravagant clothing while seeking approval of your peers coworkers or fellow students.,Buddhism,d8yr7wz,6,t5_2qhnf

9331165,0,t1_d8yqk7d,gtWouldnt that too lead to moralizing in the long run to comparisons with others and other problems?Buddhism is essentially a doctrine of peace acceptance and compassion but that does not mean that people are incapable of making mistakes and committing error of action and opinion.So there is not need to claim that littering is good or even normal because it is actually a harmful thing for all the people involved it. However the key to being enlightened is that you can judge the act of littering as bad if see it happening and going over to pick up the item littered and placing it in a garbage disposal without ever condemning the person who did it. So you need to know what is good and what is bad so that you can do good and help cease heal or amend that which is bad.However the key to proper judgment is that conviction that no human is ever bad even people are capable of error mistake and even cruelty. Buddha became aware that his extravagant life was not spiritual thus even he was capable of error. And acceptance means to accept things as they are to be free from delusion. Yet it takes knowledge to even recognize what things are.gtNo... not really... Is that bad?No it is not bad at all. However it is a fact of life that peoples attitudes beliefs and even personalities are  a product of their environment. That means that the person who seems to be foolish has never had the impulse or possibly even the opportunity learn what is right. One such case are so called criminals. If you listen to the stories of most criminals they usually lack guidance compassion or even simple basic decency in their environments. The delusion that most people seem to have is that they believe or expect children who are raised without parental guidance in violent or abusive homes to become healthy and loving adults! So acceptance means to accept the fact that environments produce similar offspring and that people who seem to have bad qualities were victims of bad circumstances. That is essentially empathy or compassion. You do not have to delude yourself into thinking bad behavior is not bad in order to accept other people and feel compassion for them. gtAnd to get to true knowledge you need to do selfinquiry work meditation and studying right?Sure knowledge is essentially the memory or the recording of knowing so mediation can help clear the mind and energize the person in this en devour and introspect or selfinquiry can help bring about new realizations which may dissolve delusions. The selfknowledge brought by introspection and promoted or aided by meditation may be useful in having empathy for people who make the mistakes that we have made or helpful in making us realize what may be useful or beneficial for others. So true judgment of what is of acceptance free from delusion  may lead to compassionate feelings and behaviors towards other people.,Buddhism,d8yskjg,1,t5_2qhnf

9424718,0,t1_d9aav4f,The narrative i.e. the prevalent assumptions that I was always familiar with as a run of the mill US citizen was that China outright invaded Tibet and slaughtered peaceful defenseless Tibetans. Nothing more nothing less....    HOWEVER when you attentively read the article I linked to you will see that the CIA was intimately involved nearly from the beginning in the events which led up to the invasion of Tibet by China.    This alone contradicts what I had always been led to believe.     ...    Am I saying that the US provoked the situation? That US clandestine interference might have made things far worse for the Tibetans? That the man we call the Dalai Lama was a CIA operative or a stooge of the West?  No. I dont say anything of the sort. I simply point out that the facts are indicative of a far more complex chain of events than what the narrativepropoundedbytheWest prefers us to believe.     ...    Why would the US be so involved and interested in Tibet back in the s?    The geopolitical situation of that time was dominated by the Cold War with the USA and the West strongly opposed to communist expansion by Russia and China. Tibet therefore was an extremely crucial strategic area. It was prudent and logical that the USWest be interested. Why? Because if Mao Tsetung could control the Tibetan plateau he would eliminate a vulnerable route into China. If the West could deny him control it would leave China extremely vulnerable strategically.  This alone leads one to understand how important it was to the West to vie for control over this area.  The real tragedy is that the Tibetans endedup being pawns in a big game and as usual the pawns get slaughtered as the big boys play their games.  ,Buddhism,d9anc2f,1,t5_2qhnf

9533843,0,t1_d9o6vl2,Hm.   When you have no thoughts arising are you aware of your surroundings?   E.g. do you hear sounds or feel air moving?The reason I ask is that if you are completely focused on the breath in the way you describe that can result in a loss of mindfulness which makes it impossible to do the integration.    You need to have both stable attention and active peripheral awareness to do it.   Its actually okay if distractions come upwhatever needs to get integrated will in fact come up as a distraction.It is also possible that you have expansive awareness but sufficient stability of attention that you are no longer subject to distractions in which case the integration cant happen in this way in this case you actually need to move to the point in the process where you are gaining exclusive attention on the object for the integration to happen.An example of what this experience is like is that you are sitting in meditation and you start to get distracted by some unpleasant memory or even a desire object that just wont go away.   When this happens if you recognize that it is an opportunity for integration you can just sit in mindfulness with the distraction in your awareness but with your attention on the breath.   I havent had one of these happen in a while so Im having trouble coming up with a specific example.   You dont always know exactly what the problem is the distracting thoughts may be more of a symptom than a glimpse of the underlying cause.   But whats characteristic of the process is that at some point the distraction subsides and then you may notice that some memory that used to really bother you suddenly has no power to disturb you anymore.That said this is just a theory about what is going on and if it doesnt fit it might be better to come up with a different theory.   Your situation does not sound fun so it would be good to come up with something that fits.   You might find it beneficial to talk about it with Tucker Peck   Hes been through similar experiences and has helped people to work through them.   He has a meditation class on Tuesdays which might be a good opportunity to get in touch or you could just get in touch with him by email and ask him if he thinks he can help you.You may also find it useful to get in touch with Willoughby Britton who has a great deal of experience with this sort of thing.   I dont know her personally but Tucker speaks highly of her as does Jeffery Martin both of whom I have a lot of respect for so I dont think youd be going wrong in seeking her out.

9632987,0,t1_da0edr1,gtThe afflicted mind compares pure view with something in order to know its pure.What do you mean by pure view? Talking about right view being seeing pure things as pure and impure things as impure is talking about distinguishing pure phenomena from impure phenomena not about distinguishing different types of view.gtMaybe youre saying to the enlightened mind there wouldnt be impurity self suffering and permanence.What Im saying is that this particular set of teachings is a Sutra teaching. Its the teaching of the four inversions of view. It is found in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra and even in the Pali Suttas and means that some things are impure and suffering and other things are pure and blissful. Tantric view is different than this and all phenomena are naturally pure.gtThis is true but doesnt negate that impurity is used as part of the tantric teachings. For example these  wrong views are mentioned extensively in the Guhyagarbha Tantra commentaries.gtLikewise impure phenomena are unstable and extremely deceptive. Th e appearances of past and future lives are mutable and exhausted by cultivating the path. Pure appearances however are the exact opposite. As soon as one has mastered a pure body and experience one will never have to experience impurity again. One will develop supreme bliss which is completely pure and free from suff ering. In this way pure appearances are reliable and undeceiving. p. Luminous Essence A Guide to the Guhyagarbha TantraIs this text saying that impure phenomena are actually impure and one should cultivate the view that they are impure? Considering that it immediately starts talking about cultivating pure appearances of things it seems to be saying the opposite namely that one should overcome the view that things are impure by replacing it with pure appearance.,Buddhism,da0gpd3,1,t5_2qhnf

Monks have continuous access to their teacher and continuous support in their practice and are thus more equipped to deal with these situations.In modern times I think lay people are better equipped for such practices but I still hold that they should not be undertaken without the guidance of a teacher .,Buddhism,dan7mjy,4,t5_2qhnf

It does not matter where the teaching comes from but once you realize what it is point at all teaching are revealed. The wording will change but the they point to the same.

9892225,0,t3_5h2psq,Im pretty active on social media. I think that with certain applications of mindfulness it can be quite insightful. Even here same thing. Think about the memories you have of events on the internet  arguments celebrations shared secrets etc. We typically dont remember the physical sensations of these memories but we remember the events and exchanges themselves fairly clearly.The internet is a realm of experience in and of itself a realm entirely manifest of mind and signssymbols. We can navigate this realm to different places. I think similar things in the car too about how I have reaction time in the car when things go wrong even though its not my body. The mind is immersed in the body of the vehicle not the body of flesh.Im not saying that its analogous to the other realms but what I am saying is that the mind moves around and can imbue a sense of self into whatever navigable apparatus it happens to using to explore reality at the moment.Now as for your actual question... I dont limit myself but I do think theres a real chance for addiction like anything else really.  I also think that most people tend to use it as a means of selfvalidation an assertion of ego and confirmation that they exist as external independent entities. While this naturally feels good because it is our inclination to want to exist as discrete beings it can perpetuate our stay in samsara.On the other hand there are many users of social media who can remain unattached from that and see it more as simply a vehicle to transmit information. My own usage is often relegated to sharing science articles or occasionally snippets of theory. There is of course some egovalidation going on too but I think that so long as I am mindful of this process I can keep it in check.Another thing I notice many of my friends even when we go camping take pictures for Instagram even if the signals out and if the signal isnt out they immediately crawl to social media apps. Thats a little bizarre to me. As active as I am on social media Im only ever active during the times where I am forced to be at a computer. If I am engaged in the world then I must be engaged in the world. But if the boss expects me to sit at a computer all day Ill use some of the down time to throw thoughts out into the ether sure.,Buddhism,dawzaou,16,t5_2qhnf

9953485,0,t1_db4ydg8,No he doesnt. I was quoting from that Sutta as you would know if you had read it. Your rules of rational debate are not supported by the Kalama Sutta which Id have thought would be common knowledge by now.If you really are so interested in being empirical then you would also have to consider that the Kalama Sutta might have later additions that werent part of presectarian Buddhism.This is something I can speak about because I have read the Chinese Agama version of the Sutta sourced from texts which are older than any extant Pali edition. Which is not to say that the age of extant editions are conclusive evidence in themselves. In this case we can say that the Pali suttas and their Agama equivalents are of comparable antiquity visavis presectarian Buddhism even if we dont have surviving original editions to back that up.One of the basic way scholars try to reconstruct early Buddhism is to compare different versions of the same basic text and look for differences. In trying to determine the earliest layer of the text you can focus on whatever the two versions have in common and leave aside the differences as possible additions. Again thats not conclusive but it removes material that cant be ruled in or out without further corroborating evidence.In the case of the Kalama Sutta the often misinterpreted passage about not relying on tradition and seeing for oneself is present in the Pali version but not the Agama equivalent. So there is a huge question surrounding this passage if anything in the Kalama Sutta is a later addition and not the words of the historical Buddha this is a very strong candidate.Thats what an empirical analysis says anyway. But I would then reiterate the Kalama Sutta does not advocate pure empiricism no matter which version you believe.,Buddhism,db4yq7w,9,t5_2qhnf

It isnt being rude or unaccepting towards drug users to point this out. Drugs are impermanent experiences subject to clinging craving passion and all the rest. They are stressful.

10075896,0,t3_5k1nws,One one side it can be someones first experience of perceiving something else then what they normally do. In this way its good because it shows just how much of the experience of reality that is in the mind. It opens the door to that its possible to perceive in many different ways.On the other side theres no guarantee that what youre perceiving on psychedelics is accurate.The Buddhist path and Buddhist meditation is all about removing the stuff that distorts perception particularly desire and aversion so you can see whats actually going on and not just what you want to see.The preparation for meditation is described in suttas such as MN gtOn returning from his almsround after his meal he sits down folding his legs crosswise setting his body erect and establishing mindfulness before him. Abandoning covetousness for the world he abides with a mind free from covetousness he purifies his mind from covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred he abides with a mind free from ill will compassionate for the welfare of all living beings he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning sloth and torpor he abides free from sloth and torpor percipient of light mindful and fully aware he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse he abides unagitated with a mind inwardly peaceful he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Abandoning doubt he abides having gone beyond doubt unperplexed about wholesome states he purifies his mind from doubt.This is basically what you need in order to see clearly. As far as I can see there is nothing about psychedelics that purifies the mind in this way which IMO means you cant really trust the insights gleaned from psychedelics.,Buddhism,dbkwsio,2,t5_2qhnf

Have you travelled independently in Asia? If the answer to either of those is no a highly recommend Shantums tours. Otherwise do it.

But for a detailed nonmysterious faithful description of jhanas and the traditional progress of insight its a great book. I am quite grateful for it.Daniel Ingram is not the only modern lay teacher who thinks its useful to demystify traditional practice.

10290855,0,t1_dcah86d,Even now most modern translations are written for the scholar. Even well conducted most people I think would still find them hard to read. I am also not convinced this is a problem. The material is hard by its very nature. It was originally composed for scholar monks and often only intended to be studied by scholar monks who would use that material for their own practice giving them experience from which they would teach the common man.I personally believe that making scriptures more readable assuming you have a good translation to begin with since many older ones are not so good should be relegated to the realm of commentary. Commentary itself has a rich tradition as being used for this purpose to the point of being preserved as canonical works and I think it has been far too much ignored in modern times.

Simply observe your present moment experience. Let the breath be the center piece of awareness and whatever else arises in the periphery just be aware of it without analysis elaboration or reaction. If you find yourself going into stories just stay aware and simply know that the mind is drifting. I really think you need to relax your effort.

10419071,0,t1_dcowoms,Theres only so many ways one can read Sanskrit compounds. And that isnt one of them. If you look at the Chapter in Don Lopezs book Prisoners of Shangri La that discusses it youll see that the Tibetans never thought it meant that anyway. I think that rendering is down to the inimitable Dr Conze. There are two possibilities for maipadme See Lopez and also Studholmes book  Im sure I give the reference on that page bahuvihi compound lotus which is a jewel. Tatpurua compound lotus of jewels or maybe a jewelled lotus a subcategory of tatpurua technically known as karmadhraya though sometimes treated as a separate categoryThere are no other possibilities allowed by the rules of the language. And these same rules apply in related languages like Pli. Indeed vestiges of them can be found in English as well. Compound nouns with implied grammatical relationships amongst the parts are a structural feature of IndoEuropean languages. Literary Sanskrit and commentarial Pi are full of very long compounds with  or  or even more nouns and adjectives all tangled up. Theyre a pain to read. However bauhvhi compounds are typically used as adjectives. So our word is almost certainly a tatpurua because there is no noun here to be described. So take your pick between lotus of jewels and a jewelled lotus i.e. either a lotus made of jewels or one which is covered in jewels.The reading jewel in the lotus as a compound would have to be padmamai. Another tatpurua compound but with an implied instrumental instead of the genitive. Conze though that it might be two words with padme being in the locative case in the lotus. But mai is a masculine noun so in Sanskrit it would have to take an ending mai. And syntax rules which are less strict would favour putting padme first. So the jewel in the lotus would in Sanskrit be more likely to be padme mani but at the very least mai padme. So this is wrong. And its deeply unlike in a mantra anyway. So why would he get this so wrong? Well mostly old Sanskrit is written with gaps between syllables but not between words. So its written like       | Its up to the reader to know their word endings and just spot them and figure out the words and grammar. Those old texts are pretty hard to read. Ive been over all of the manuscripts Conze used for his Sanskrit edition of the Heart Sutra and theyre mostly like this. This leaves some possibility of ambiguity at times. Though really in this case there is only one likely reading and I think Conze was just going off on one which happened quite often. Conze despite being brilliant was a highly erratic man and his translations are often rather fanciful. His editions of Sanskrit texts are full of mistakes also. I have officially corrected one of them Anyway mai has no case marker which tells us that ma i pa dme is one compound word maipadme. And if any kind of Sanskrit rules apply at all it can only be a compound. So all those very many places where you see the mantra written as o mai padme h are wrong. In mantras Sanskrit rules dont always apply. As I said there is good evidence to suggest that mantras were not composed according to Classical Sanskrit rules at all but according to a vernacular Prakrit or some Sanskritised version of a Prakrit. And sometimes mantras or more especially dhras are just strings of words with no grammar at all. But the obvious way to see it from a Sanskrit point of view is as a compound. To treat it as something else would require extraordinary evidence and it doesnt exist. Indeed as Lopez shows evidence from Tibetan works on mantra points the other way.This is probably more information than you wanted but I enjoyed the analysis and others might find it useful. At the very least you get an idea of the logic involved and why the case for spelling and translation is solidly against Conze. ,Buddhism,dcp2j8d,2,t5_2qhnf

10748385,0,t1_ddolibo,gtIve been writing a book on karma and rebirth for a few years now. Im particularly interested in the documented historical disputes about how rebirth worked.So based on your research do you find that a majority of Buddhists no longer subscribe to the idea that elements of past personality can reappear in a successive birth? Or do you mean something else when you say that most Buddhists dont believe that these elements can span between successive births?I dont deny that Buddhism in Asia has modernist elements in particular I think the presentation of Buddhism given to Asians is increasingly a version shorn of ideas that are challenging to Western norms. From reading Obeyesekere and others I get the impression that th Century Asian Buddhists largely accepted Western critiques of Buddhism as having a purely rational underlying basis based on their study of translated scripture and selectively identifying certain texts or passages within texts as later and a deluded and superstitious popular expression and have modified the way that Buddhism is presented in Asia and abroad to match this analysis. That revised modernist Buddhism is often passed off in the West as original Buddhism on the basis of selective reading and a very paradoxical interpretation of the enlightenment and limitations of the Buddha and his heirs. This is a pattern that has been repeated in several religious traditions due to colonialism the view for instance that real Hinduism is actually monotheistic based on the elevation of certain strains of Upanishadic thought and any claims of actual polytheism among Hindus are a false impression or somehow ignorant. Its definitely popular among Westerneducated Indians to say that there is some monotheisticcompatible power behind the various gods and there is certainly support for that opinion in various scriptures and traditions. To say that this is the only view or the real view and that other views are deviant to me seems to elevate elite forms of religion and forms that dont offend the strong monotheistic bias of Westerners at the expense of authentically reflecting the diversity of Hindu thought and practice.gt Any kind of continuity is eternalism. Im not sure that I buy that. The Buddha defined eternalism in terms of a permanent unchanging atman. Successive collections of aggregates all of them empty and impermanent can produce continuity in which there is no fixed element. Thinking in terms of waves and resonance rather than Greek atomism made this make more sense to me.gtWhat I noticed after  years of being a Buddhist is that nearly all Buddhists have this duplicity. We segue between a narrative which emphasises continuity actions have consequences and another narrative which critiques any kind of continuity there are no agents or patients.Im not sure that that is duplicity... if you view the world according to the traditional Buddhist view that consciousness gives rise to material form rather than the other way around then things that are obvious and undeniable in the ordinary world like the existence of beings are actually delusions but the ultimate view no inherent existence must be continually asserted in order to prevent students from clinging to what seems obviously apparent from the gross evidence of the senses. It also reflects that in the first case the teachers are speaking in terms of actors in the conventional realm but in the latter often speaking in terms of meditative experience that is cultivated in order to produce dispassion and insight.,Buddhism,ddom3vf,1,t5_2qhnf

10919948,0,t3_5vzxek,Buddhism has differing traditions.  The sidebar has a lot of recommendations and many of them have roots in the Pali Canon which is generally considered the body of texts most clearly attributed to the Buddha.As to a Mahayana text as was mentioned in another thread today the Jewel Ornament of Liberation is a solid one written by Gampopa.Otherwise of course you can also go to the sources themselves and read the suttassutras.  There are both suttas in the Pali Canon that are accessible on Accesstoinsight and you can also find various Mahayana sutras available online or in print.I probably wouldnt dive right into reading the tantras from the beginning as without a strong Mahayana basis Im not sure if it would be terribly useful.However as I reread your question if youre looking for more of a historicacademic book about Buddhism rather than a personal practiceoriented book then Im not entirely sure what Id recommend.

By methods I mean practices that strengthen you spiritually.Theravada is the foundation Mahayana is built on top of Thera and Vajrayana is built on top of Mahayana. So all the precepts and stuff in Mahayana and Theravada needs to be practiced correctly for you to be an honest Vajrayana practitioner.People dismiss Vajrayana because it is farfetched but you can verify its authenticity by following the Theravada and Mahayana path gradually. It does not engage in practices that are hypocritical to the Dharma.Mainly they are divided by view also. In Mahayana the view is expansive because it is like a net thrown on everyone. Your perception expands because you think of others. In Vajrayana it becomes pure and it is supposed to be expansive as well.In terms of efficiency Vajrayana is the most powerful because Dharma fades with time and so does its efficiency.

11138412,0,t3_5ywi2h,What is your personal and family religious practices daily weekly annually etc.I live with two close friends that believe in a higher power though they dont claim to be sure of what that might be. Most of my family is primarily Christian or Agnostic and generally keep to themselves in regards to their spirituality or lack thereof. Nothing was ever really forced on me except for when my mom went through a short lived devout Catholic phase when I was in elementary school. My girlfriend is a Quaker and generally keeps the specifics of her beliefs to herself and is very tolerant when I bore her with my own haha. I dont know the details about how she feels and I dont really care to. As for me personally my practice involves daily meditation sitting laying down walking or all of the above and I try my best to be mindful of my actions so as to follow the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. I dont chant much but I sometimes use Mala beads to focus on my breathing and concentration. I dont adhere to any one school and sporadically visit different temples and centers to ask questions and learn about the dynamics of different Sanghas. Nothing too fancy no specific rituals that I can think of. If a convert what is the reason for your conversion or choiceI grew up an atheist with a lot of questions. Religion always seemed silly to me especially ones that reached to an external source for happiness. I began exploring meditation as a way to combat depression and had a very profound epiphany regarding ego while meditating one day. I feel like up until that point I didnt truly know what it meant to have an ego. Thats what started it all for me. What are some aspects of Buddhism that particularly attracted youMany things about it simply make sense to me. The first time I read the Four Noble Truths I felt like I had finally found home. Ive always felt like unnecessary attachments are the root cause for the sorrows of the world. I felt for years like the desire to go to a Heaven is born from attachment and the idea of Nirvana feels much less like wishful thinking in my eyes. Ive also always cared deeply for all people and animals and that no life is more important than another. It makes sense to me to go through life inflicting as little suffering as possible. In summary most of it just feels right I guess.What are challenges to maintaining religious practice that you or others have experienced while living in the United States and experiences of prejudice or misunderstanding of the religion by others.Eh it certainly isnt too difficult to be a Buddhist in America in the sense that I never feel oppressed or mistreated because of my beliefs. At most I answer questions or correct common misconceptions about Buddhism in general. The average American knows very little about what we believe or they assume that our views are more uniform across the world than what they really are. The fast paced materialistic Western lifestyle is definitely exhausting to be around sometimes though.What are your strategies for passing active religious belief to the next generation.I have a huge problem with childhood indoctrination. A kid is going to believe almost anything you tell them if they respect you as an authority figure. Its virtually brainwashing. Your personal beliefs should be found on your own and I think its much more beneficial to simply teach children to be good to other people and how to handle their emotions without needing any form of supernatural justification to be moral. If my son ever has a question about Buddhism I will answer. I will not urge him in any direction though as far as religion is concerned. Specific religious issues encountered in healthcare that you are likely or believe to be likely to experience because of your religionI dont see my religion impacting how Im treated by the medical system. Im not sure I understand the question.If youre a healthcare professional does your religion affect or contribute to your healthcare profession?Im not a healthcare professional. I am going to school for Psychology though and if I pursue any sort of career in therapy or something along those lines then I could see it helping with my understanding of emotions and what causes them. But Im not certain that I want that career so who knows.  ,Buddhism,deuj0dm,1,t5_2qhnf

I had managed to talk a PSBstation in to giving me a  month extension visa earlier in the trip but had asked at another one in another province and was flatly denied.

11327195,0,t3_61m22w,All the other comments in this thread are great advice. I have one more suggestion to add on top of whats been said forgive your younger self as well for not getting the game back. Coming out worse in an unjust event is a kick to our own self esteem especially if you struggled to right it. That makes it hard to let go even if you want to forgive the other person from a conscious pov. During meditation as youre practicing forgiveness look inwardly and walk yourself through your memories of all the events every detail. Its like playing a movie but you know the ending. Say to yourself you did what you knew best at be time. Forgive yourself for the ignorance that let you trust the friend and that caused drama that ensued also focus on the impermanence and emptiness  knowing your brothers game was going to be lost from the beginning.  You can do the same thing again as you forgive the friend too. This is just a method borrowing both Buddhist methods and Western psychology. I have personally found talking to the subconsciousunconscious has helped in letting go. Everyone is different. ,Buddhism,dffx30u,1,t5_2qhnf

The term interbeing was not yet used at that time. Although we think of the Avatamsaka when we hear the term interbeingthe teaching of interbeing also has its roots in vijttanavada because in vijnanavada cognition always includes subject and object together.

Both can happen in a romantic scene and be pleasant.It is known that the Buddha in great length warned us to guard our senses and thinking faculties to not allow them to deceive us about the nature of our feelings and desires.

The movements get slighter and slighter...... Until it stops.Then as it stops... give it an hour or so the layers start to separate. The denser material sinks to the bottom. The lessdense material floats to the top.You see a denser brown at the bottom of the mug and a clear liquid on the top.

11531163,0,t1_dg31oek,Thank you. Part of the reason I ask is that I think there does seem to be a difference in many cases between alcohol and other substances.In at least the US  I dont know where you are located  we have a fairly ingrained attitude that says Drugs are bad and basically lump all illegal substances into that Drug category.However many of these illegal substances were not always illegal and they werent always considered to be drugs.Of course alcohol isnt illegal but thats a different conversation.Speaking as a physician I think there is considerable medical use  in the right situation dose etc  for things like marijuana various psychedelic substances etc for example. And of course opioids have been used for quite some time despite having mindaltering effects.In some cases they can be very effective for treating things like certain types of pain syndromes certain types of depression andor anxiety andor other mental health issues addictions etc.When people read about Buddhism sometimes I feel as though certain teachers throughout history have expanded on the actual wording used in for example the th precept and have introduced a certain conservative bias.In many cases Im sure this is fine  many people might do well to focus on mindfulness rather than substances in general.But in other cases I think that bias has probably gone a bit too far not always for the benefit. And my bias is that we should not be inaccurate in terms of what the Buddha actually said as much as possible  we should not try to spin his message even if we think that its good to do so.Anyway thanks again.

11559309,0,t3_64ytrx,Buddhism is still a minority religion typically less than  of Western countries including all the ethnic Buddhists because it does not appeal to Western values. Most Buddhists still see monks as ideal Buddhists renunciation as a virtue. Dont simply doesnt appeal  especially the sexstarvedmenindresses thing. Furthermore unlike all other polities where Buddhism has flourished Buddhism does not appeal to the Western ruling elites. And as Buddhism is deeply opposed to the principles driving the political elite this is unlikely to change. And our ruling elite are not looking for legitimation the way that dictators do and most Buddhist countries in history have been dictatorships. Christians often think they are the chosen people and elites in Christian or formerChristian countries are convinced of it. This is particularly true of the English speaking countries. When someones raison detre is wealth a religion enjoining them to poverty will never fly. The metaphysics of Buddhism is confused and confusing. Elitist Buddhists use knowledge of arcane doctrines as a a shibboleth to exclude the uninitiated. Elitist twaddle often dominates the very social media platforms that might otherwise spread our ideas. The Buddhist idea of reality is nonsensical and yet promoted as profound wisdom both confirmed by and yet somehow superseding science. While suckers are born every minute they typically only make up  of the population. So the people who will put up with the bullshit in order to belong to a community are limited. The goal of Buddhism is typically portrayed as impossibly far off and practically unattainable. Those who say they have attained it are held in suspicion not to say contempt and subjected to scorn and ridicule by a mass of unenlightened Buddhists who refuse to accept such claims on principle. When we avoid metaphysics and peddle myth instead its  a myth that people should leave home abandon all their worldly goods and their families to pursue an unattainable goal. At the cost of themselves. Those who are not out talking the nonsense are often introverts who are happy to spend time away from other people meditating and generally retreating from the world. These kinds of elitists have no time for anything except meditation. The middle people who organise stuff are mediocre. So Buddhists are usually either peddling nonsense or quietism. And surprise surprise few are buying. Christianity offers a much more consoling view of death and the afterlife. And a more coherent story in which the afterlife is linked to ethics. The Buddhist versions are incoherent a lot of the time if there is no self then the fact is that there are no ethics and no redemption. Christianity is also family friendly and community oriented. Buddhism is antifamily on the whole and Buddhist communities are all too often deeply hierarchical and patriarchal. But in the final analysis religiosity is on the decline in the West. In the UK no religion is now the most common response to surveys of religious belief. People are fed up with bizarre metaphysical systems that require blind faith blind obedience to celibate men and any system which counsels against the material world as the only world. Some will no doubt argue that Buddhism does not require blind faith. But try contradicting an article of faith and watch the response you get. Most Buddhists are absolutely convinced that they have a hotline to reality and that no evidence could ever disprove what they believe. And they get angry when you try to contradict them. Buddhism is absolutely a religion of blind faith for the very great majority. Given the reality of Buddhism I find it bizarre that anyone would even bother to ask why it has never really taken off in the West. It is the wrong religion in the wrong place at the wrong time being promoted by the wrong people. ,Buddhism,dg692yd,1,t5_2qhnf

All youre doing is planting the intention. Just have a simple intention and repeatedly over time you will see Metta bear its fruit. Plant the seed in the right conditions and wait patiently for it to grow.Also you cant really make other people happy during Metta practice. Its mostly to change your state of mind. Others will see that but peoples happiness are dependent on themselves and their karma. You dont have that power to make other people happy. You seem to be wanting to love others in order to get something in return that isnt true love. Develop and know thyself trying to have compassion for others before having your own selfcompassion is not going to get you any where.Metta for me doesnt work that well but I will get back to it since Ive opened up a lot from breath meditation. For some people if Metta does not work then do anapasati higher states especially jhanas where the hindrances fall away including illwill will open you up and clear emotional and energy blockages.

Regardless a teacher should have some sort of paper trail and reputation even relatively unknown local teachers. Fame should not be an important criteria there are many well qualified and wonderful teachers that operate at a local level. Also as you go along you will get a sense of who is reputable as your familiarity with the dhamma increases.,Buddhism,dgtu48j,5,t5_2qhnf
11769161,0,t1_dgtwr7h,Not being a scholar of Buddhist thought Im afraid I couldnt do the answer justice. Id just recommend reading more about concepts of ultimate vs realative existence form and emptiness etc..  generally it takes a combination of study and meditation practice to really make sense of the information in a way that answers that question. ,Buddhism,dgu2d2s,1,t5_2qhnf

11801432,0,t3_68dwve,A Buddhist can believe in whatever they want. How much these beliefs will help is what matters. For Buddhist practice the belief in God is pretty much unnecessary. We know that there is dukkha we know the cause of dukkha we know the cessation of dukkha and we know the path to the cessation of dukkha and whether or not there is a God this isnt going to change. In a practice where one has to detach themselves from pretty much everything including nothing its easiest to start with what we cannot directly observe.,Buddhism,dgxqeo3,8,t5_2qhnf
11801601,0,t1_dgxqqxi,I asked a guide the question What is generosity?The guide appeared quite close and told whatever story or phrasings it wasvery fast.  I tried to make sense of it but my memory and observation was not great and so I only gathered the key words I was pretty sure of a boy his father and a fish.The story ukotikarna shared did meet those general criteria and I was happy to have read it.There was then talk about some sort of clothing designed especially for me that was about to be ready which involved me feeling flattered and humbled.  I dont know if that would also be described as generosity but it seemed to be a nice gesture I could pick up on and invoke in my real life without expecting anything in return.The story you shared was also good although not necessarily matching with this particular dream.  Elements from Irony of Samsara vaguely in common appeared in another dream with this same guide that involved a dog myself and some sort of amphibious fish creature the dog was helping me hunt.,Buddhism,dgxr3h4,1,t5_2qhnf
11803156,0,t1_dgxvmjb,gt Something wrote this post. Something answered it. From this point of view we exist. What is it that exists? The thing that exists. That thing is part of conditioned existence it has precursors in the form of causes. I suspect you are wondering about the nameandform part of this chain of conditioned existence What is nameandform? If you perceive your existence without delusion it is what you perceive it to be. Can you rely on it to bring about permanence satisfactory continuance an everlasting self? No. It is a conditioned thing and it is subject to the three marks of existence.,Buddhism,dgxxg14,2,t5_2qhnf
11807777,0,t3_68h7si,gtis there a way to practice Buddhisn in my daily life without actually converting ?Of course! Try speech for instance. Before you speak practice mindfulness of your intentions. This builds concentration and good communication too.LikeHonesty can be very difficult but very rewarding.If youre already honest add relevance since honesty can turn to verbose blabla.If you already avoid blabla add timeliness since facts presented in certain ways can cause fights.Timeliness?Like addiction for serious wakeup calls it can be great timing to speak unendearing words not presenting the facts with sugar on top.On the other hand sadness. if a person is crying we dont immediately list their failures even if theyre true and very relevant. we first bring love and acceptance and cross other bridges later.,Buddhism,dgygaqn,30,t5_2qhnf
