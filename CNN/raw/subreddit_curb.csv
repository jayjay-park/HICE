1170995,0,t3_23d4ul,Im still optimistic that a new season will be made. I think Larry is bent out on television and putting in the work...but I also think he simply doesnt want to put out a shoddy product. Since it has been so long...I can only imagine that he and the writers would have a lot of material for a new season. Curb has been more of a retirement project for him. And because he works for HBO the greatest TV station ever hes always done the show at his own pace. And I think within a couple years he will be itching to get back to work. I do think their will be one more season before the show ends completely.,curb,ci1cvkz,1,t5_2rcr2

3305022,0,t3_2w19c9,Im surprised this post didnt gain much traction. An amazing interview. Also Im not an avid Howard listener but I find Robin to be so annoying sometimes. I was cringing a lot during this interview. Seemed like Howard and Larry just wanted to ignore her. ,curb,cp4zyy7,1,t5_2rcr2
3337584,0,t1_cp8p6eo,Having said that I would really like to have seen Larry in Paris.When I was there some years ago I was having a lot of Larry David moments. The metro is the worsttheres no elevators you gotta schlep your bags up and down stairsI saw people in wheelchairs being dragged up stairs. And you cant get out. You have to have this ticket and put it through some machine. Youre inside this big metro areawhich is like a shopping mall or an airportbut you have to get out with your ticket and god forbid you try to get out any other way because the cops will stop you. I forgot all my French and was just standing there yelling I wanna get out!,curb,cp8pko2,1,t5_2rcr2
