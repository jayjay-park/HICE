I wish that their content got noticed more than screamer content and was seen to the people who dont know that what these companies are doing. So I think we need to spread the Gaming Illuminaughtys work across the Internet and get everyone enlightened.,Gaming_illuminaughty,d4o6wd7,1,t5_3d6gn

9384208,0,t3_5949sg,Its half true some care about the numbers and want to join the bandwagon while others care about personality and quality. For me I care about personality and value why would I watch anything that doesnt do anything useful to my life? My subs said they like my quality and love seeing me progress. I dont judge any channel based on subs i prefer and watch a lot of small channels cuz they actually want progress and use youtube to open doors.

9617843,0,t3_5cquaq,Ever since I heard about the mini I was exited about it. But as soon as more information was coming out about it i started to lose interest in it and it wasnt what I thought it would be. Granted the mini has some decent games but for  thats pricey especially since theyre emulators this mini was marketed towards casuals that either want a piece of their childhood back or dont want to financially start collecting retro gaming witch can be pretty expensive. Ever since resellers have gotten a hold of these theyve been going up to as you can see in the picture  witch is absolutely stupid for a shitty representation of the glory the NES holds. I absolutely hate resellers you grow more hate when collecting these retro games. Everyone is trying to rape the community. Ive seen people that claim theyre trying to save gaming and sell these for . Im not gonna knock the hustle dont get me wrong Im upset that people are actually buying emulations of games witch emulating in my opinion is already trash. Do not buy from resellers Nintendo will more than likely restock these minis for Christmas time. Just like amibos.This has been a real eye opener to see how terrible gaming is at a stand point and the fraudulent people out here claiming to be a part of a better cause. They say history repeats it self so Im just prepared for another gaming crash. Im just watching people destroy the one thing I love in life and take it away. You may think its over reacting but its bottleneck tension that will happen sooner or later. ,Gaming_illuminaughty,d9ylhx2,3,t5_3d6gn

10557915,0,t3_5r3sr3,Ill just come up with a couple general ones off the top of my head. rgaming rvideos rGames Rules dont allowrpcgaming rpcmasterrace rgamers Or other specific subreddits like the Mass Effect subreddit for Ethoss video. You just have to be strategic when you post. Read the rules or PM a mod if its okay to post a video. Dont multipost on the same subreddit. Know what audience it might appeal to. Places like rpcgaming like Ethoss videos because its indepth and sparks discussion and most of them eat that up. And lastly expect them haters. Doesnt hurt to try. People like Dunkey Totalbiscuit Idiotech AngryCentaurGaming etc. benefit immensely from Reddit. If youre a reddit vet you probably already know this. ,Gaming_illuminaughty,dd4uxqr,2,t5_3d6gn
