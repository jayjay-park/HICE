11218042,0,t1_df38h2e,gt Paul Mason styleGood points all around! Yeah Im always skeptical of these meta maps that focus on particular temporal cycles. Im familiar with Spengler and Vico but even they were more arguably archetypal in that the particular dates of their cycles were up for interpretation. To have a specific timeline  years etc already sets it up for contentious alternative interpretationsas you rightly and quickly point out. Im actually with you about postcapitalism. Have you also read Rushkoffs Throwing Rocks at the Google BusMore on that point rather than this cyclical view of recent history I think we should have our eye on the larger picturethe postcapitalist regenerative society that requires a systems change on so many levels. Pinchbecks recent book How Soon is Now? is exploring that. ,Integral,df3juvd,2,t5_2qjvj
