3750049,0,t3_33d0yf,Thats a good question! Rycote makes a raincover for their windshields although since you mention an H Im assuming you dont have something like that. However it would be possible to build yourself a little housing that would serve the same purpose. A chicken wire dome that was lined first in some plastic wrap and then in some thickish foam to absorb the water impacts and the water itself should get you a solid rain isolation booth of sorts.The next trick will be isolating the ground directly beneath the recorder. That ones a bit harder ,fieldrecording,cqjqc3m,2,t5_2spta

Even something free like Audacity can do this though you will want to look at the spectrogram preferences since the default settings are not at all helpful learning how to use the spectrogram settings is a skill all its own and totally useful. Izotope RX is an incredible noise reduction program but is rather expensive if you arent doing this professionally. Adobe Audition is much cheaper and has some ok tools based off of RX.You didnt provide a sample so it is possible of course that something is faulty. The NTG works better with phantom power than the internal battery as well. Maybe you have a bad cable a common place for people to try to reduce cost is to buy a really cheap and terrible cable. If you dont have a budget anything in the price range of what you have already is really going to be about the same. You also dont say what youre trying to record so it is difficult to suggest a different microphone. If you do go that way the NTG is a step up. Also consider used equipment such as Sennheiser MKH  or  assuming you want to stick with a short shotgun mic.Depending where you live in the world look at oade.com for recorders that have been modified specifically for field recording or look for a used Sound Devices MixPre or  to add as an improved frontend to the recorder.Beyond all that I highly suggest practicing the craft if your recordings are not satisfying find something that will work for you given what you already have. ,fieldrecording,czk5nl0,1,t5_2spta
6592321,0,t3_3yvjzq,Recording is like photography you can adjust the sound as you like. Even use some compression or reverb if you think that it will be better.,fieldrecording,d0177pz,1,t5_2spta

8981203,0,t3_516fgi,Well just to follow up I did get the conversion cable described above. I dropped my voltage down to v plugged up set my recording source and adjusted levels.I walked around with the mics in my ears but I also plugged in the line out. It was amazing. Everything was much louder and intense but super clear.I was able to walk around the hotel where I am staying with the recorder in my bag and the headphones in my ears to not raise suspicion. The recording had the expected depth and I went back to my room to listen to the  min. of recording I did. Incredible.While these mics probably dont use the pinna of your ears as much as I would like they still did an absolutely fantastic job. Now my only concern is the build quality of the microphones and cables.  For  what can you really expect. Im looking forward to using these for interviews. I believe these will provide a much more natural interaction with my subjects.,fieldrecording,d7rej79,2,t5_2spta
11335064,0,t3_61o7wr,I think youll find that there are as many options as people!  I might reccomend a handheld recorder at first maybe the zoom H for a pocket sided one or the h with its changeable mic capsules  other brands are Tascam nagra just to get the basics down while you think about a fully stocked kit. You will also appreciate having this later when you can just put it in your bag and go.Once you decide to go with a more modular setup is where you need to make a decision about what and how you want to record and how portable it needs to be.  If you are trying to record live concerts you will have a different kit than if you want to record bird calls and different even than the kit that may record mechanical sounds.The basic pieces of gear you will need areRecorder this is what you would plug your Mics into it will record your sounds but also mix monitor via headphones name files and put the files on SD or CF cards and any number of utility functions.Microphones this will be the sensor you use to capture sound. Almost like the lenses for a camera there are different mics for different purposes. Long shotgun short shotgun Midside condensers with cardioid supercardioid and hypercardioid pickup patterns maybe even a dynamic as they dont pick up a lot of background noise.  You will probably needwant multiple mics and possibly even a matched stereo pair  or  for surround sound!Wind protection  this  is an important piece that could render the rest of your kit useless if neglected.  Wind causes turbulence and pockets of highlow air pressures that WILL be picked up by your mic. At very least most mics come with a foam but a more substantial fuzzy windscreen or a blimp or a combination of the two will certainly be necessary on windy days. Maybe even a roll off at hz will be necessary.  Headphones you need to monitor your recordings to make sure they sound right. A good set not earbuds. Sony MDR is televisionfilm standard for monitoring headphones and they are reasonably priced.Mounts and stands  you will need something to hold the mic.  A pistol grip or boom pole for your hands will work but you will also need a shock mount to defend against handling noise.  Maybe a mic stand or flexi mount will be useful for long recordings.Cases and bags  you need to store and transport this stuff safely so it works when you get there.  Maybe you want to wear your recorder so a sound bag is necessary. Maybe you went with a handheld to take backpacking you want a case so your unit doesnt get crushed in your bag or rained on. And your accessories need cases too.  Pelican cases are awesome and watertight but a small backpack you already own might be enough. Rain protection might also fall into this category.Cables and adapters seriously you will spend a lot on these dont cheap out or you will regret it. Maybe even learn to solder and repair cables to save yourself some money.  And you will find yourself needing more adapters as you want to try new things especially if you are recording for film or music.  Batteries a lot of rechargeable batteries.  Panasonic makes a  mAh AA rechargeable that are amazing. Your particular gear will have specific power needs. You might find that an external Li battery will be the only thing that gets you through the day.Wireless a whole other thing that probably isnt useful unless you have dialogue to record but this is field recording subreddit so I will assume its not necessary.Accessories  tapes digital media clips ties screen protectors pens paper flashlight earplugs gloves and anything else. You will know what you need when you need it right away but cant get them because it takes a couple days to ship. But planning ahead can get you set up pretty well.,fieldrecording,dfgt5sd,1,t5_2spta
