4930050,0,t3_3iex86,Developers response to Jims video My comment in response to the video for easier readingIm not going to be long winded so Ill just outline a response.. I actually had fun creating the Greenlight Simulator page. Yes anger was a part of the picture but after . years of patience thinning I wanted to have some fun. For  dollars I could at least get that out of it.. That Trailer is outdated and I cant make a new one on a whim because I just own a laptop with Intel HD Graphics mobile. I cannot actually record gameplay of my titles with a remotely decent FPS. The trailer before hand used game footage recorded by a tester and they could not manipulate the game precisely how I would have even given detailed instructions.. Stand out? A visual novel about porn addiction stands out last I checked. As for Haven it should be noted Im redrawing the game entirely so the trailer is outdated. You showed one screenshot of the redraw in progress. You had access to others you could of shown but I didnt expect you to do so.. Havens protagonist is named Cleril because Haven is the third game in the series of Haven titles. Cleril is my pen name since Ive written poetry since I was  years old. Thats it. It has little to do with narcissism if you were implying that as Cleril represents perhaps an idea rather than an embodiment of me as a person. He is after all never given a real face and it shrouded like most any idea.. The Jester is actually being ironic since he has no hands. He cant masturbate. Im not even sure he has a  or a .. Yes its my voice work. My Name is Addiction puts you in the shoes of an addict so I figured the trailer should show that. Ive been told that its too heavy but My Name is Addiction for what it is is a rather heavy experience for most.. I never expected the front page. A page would be nice. Im surprised Kotaku didnt touch it. They would hate it actually which I expected but no response from anyone really. Two of the independent news sites that covered it came to me.. Yes I get press coverage when I make a joke to relieve stress about my legitimate titles getting zero coverage. And the coverage you provide of my legitimate work is the bare mininum you possibly could have providing no insight besides whats visible in trailers and on the greenlight page. Thanks for at least that but of course the presentation of me in this video is completely absurd. You could of contacted me played My Name is Addiction yourself a google search would of netted you either Gamejolt or Desura for download or any other number of things to get a clearer picture but showcasing me as a bitter artsy fartsy pretentious developer suits you just fine.. Oh thats what My Name is Addiction is? Its not a visual novel? What? Have you never seen a cinematic trailer before? What gameplay am I going to show you in this particular visual novel? A choice box? This is what I meant in my last bullet point. You misrepresent me and my titles. At least you represent them but it would not have been difficult to properly assess them. You have no actual idea what My Name is Addiction is about or what it entails when it is openly available for free on various sites. You could at least say youre lazy in addition to presenting my work.. Greenlight Simulator doesnt exist. I didnt even save the multimedia fusion file after taking screenshots.. I want legitimate press coverage for my legitimate titles. You didnt satiate that desire and in fact you did the exact opposite. Thanks.,JimSterling,cufz0cs,8,t5_2to10

Sure there were always attempts to monetize the industry more because it is ultimately a business but it was mostly limited to making hyped sequels and making shiny demosshareware. The real madness started with the rise of FP MMOs in the late s and inclusion of microtransactions in FPS games which arguably started with Mann Co. Store in TF in .

9006079,0,t1_d7tuf6l,Warzone Firefight is a glorified half assed mod its the minimal amount of effort required to make warzone resemble a Firefight esque mode. The game luanched unfinished that much is clear it had less content than Halo  from launch.The  mission campaign was  missions of walking around and talking to strangers and some separate missions where just a single mission chopped in two to give the illusion of more missions.Although TBF I stopped buying Halo for s gameplay I bought it for forge and campaign . I dont like s Halo Multiplayer didnt like Reachs eitherBut that wont stop me pointing out how its lacking in variety or intresting designs. As an avid Forger and Level Designer I use it to make Multiplayer map layout testbeds for my level design portfolio s level design is boring and average. Some personal qualms with  in generalAnd personally I just dont like s art style more than Bungies. Bungies art style felt like Science Fiction Ie the original Alien movie feels a realistic future for human technology which helps to make the other stuff feel more different and the universe more grounded s feels like Science Fantasy Ie star wars unrealistic human advancement after all star wars isnt set with actual Humans but Halo is so that art style doenst make senseIm also not a fan of s gameplay it has good gameplay that is unique in its own right but it doesnt play like Halo. Its not an simple Sandbox Arena Shooter game. Halos identity was this Simple Movement Arena Shooter game and used the map selection weapon and vehicle sandbox to create a diverse experience.  made Halo feel like a twitch shooter with a longer killtime. In Halo  your v map options are generic arenas nothing that stands out as great half of the maps follow the  base  tower design logic of Midship  of them are  Lane maps and the asymmetric maps are awful except Plaza. In Halo  you had maps like Midship Lockout or The Pit but you also Had High Ground Last Resort Damnation Prisoner Chill Out or Construct. Maybe some had issues but at least they Tried to do something different intresting and new.  map design is so unoriginal. Im not buying another  Halo maybe HA if its actually good and replicates and improves the Halo  Multiplayer properly alongside the new forge mode I love the Forge tool not an emulation on the Halo  engine like HA.Im not some Bungie Fanboy either I dont particularly enjoy Halo Reachs Loadout and Bloom gameplay in vs actually Id rather play v Halo  vanilla settings than Reach but at least Reach offered so much good content from launch so much variety and the gameplay worked well in other modes so could be enjoyable anyway. I dont want this to feel like a rant this is coming from someone who has studied game design and is trying to set up a game studio maybe not the most analytical language but its a short analysis of how I see their games. Its unoriginal in their identity. The gameplay while somewhat unique in its own right still feels like a twitch shooter like CoD or Destiny not what made Halo stand out. Their map selection doesnt create variety you play v on generic arenas BTB with BRs which break BTB gameplay in Halo  Because the BR in Halo  has way more range than any previous BR and kills vehicles to quickly or you play Warzone which is Halo s Dominion on steroids and doesnt replace a good Halo BTB mode.Ultimately  have came to Halo and where many expected them to continue that unique Halo gameplay artsyle and feel they instead elected to use the Halo brand to sell what they feel like making with a very loose link to the recognisable Halo gameplay imagery and characters.And sadly they are still allowed to make major Halo games after Halo  has sold worse than any other major Halo title or even Halo  ODST.  Halo games are described by many as the Prequel trilogy of games and its an accurate description. They dont understand what made the original games so successful and just want to do what they feel like like Lucas with the prequels regardless of the massive Fanbase that gameplay and artsyle had.,JimSterling,d7ue1uu,1,t5_2to10

I misattributed what you said about Ultimate team being the amount they stole. For that I can apologize.......For the microtransactions that EA Activision Ubisoft and every other AAA developer have surgically inserted into every successful franchise they can I have NO apologies or sympathies. I dont give a rats pube who Ultimate team are or what they stole. The fact that they stole REAL money from EA using one of the bullshit currencies that EA wants GAMERS to pay for is all the poetic friggin justice I need. Its simply more proof that these microtransactions are NOT there for the benefit of gamers but rather the corporate twats who just cant handle making SOME money. Ill offer another olive branch as well Ill wager it did or WILL cost gamers real money. I suspect at some point EAs going to rebalance the currency in FIFA to deal with this black marketthat they helped create to make it less appealing for people to use over EAs trademarked funbucks instead. Theyll cut the amounts people earn in game or force a set cap on everyone so you have to make smaller purchases over and overmuch like a drug dealer gets you back after the first free hit to prove youre a loyal EA customer....,JimSterling,da4i9pv,1,t5_2to10

10365531,0,t3_5ocbi9,I said this in short in Twitter but Ill expand on it here.I genuinely believe that Nintendo moving to Switch  at least this soon  is the true mistake. And you wanna know why? Because Switch feels like a halfmeasure. A compromise. It has no focus and reeks of panic as if they scrambled to get a new system out rather than even try to make the most of what they had. Whether that was due to their spot in the console race Iwatas passing a mixture or something else entirely I couldnt tell you. But Switch doesnt have the conviction I felt with the Wii U. It feels like Nintendo hurriedly falling into lockstep with the rest of the industry. It abandons all the good parts of what makes Nintendo unique and leaves us with just their shortcomings.Wii U was a solid system. It had a lot going for it. It still does. It was and still is the only Gen home console with free online and complete backwardscompatibility with not only all its predecessors games but its tech. That  along with greater DS crosstalk than what was done between the Wii and DS  made Nintendos Gen ecosystem feel like all the investments that had been made since the DS launch both monetarily from us consumers as well as technologically from Nintendo themselves were carried over. Wii U genuinely felt like a culmination of everything Iwataera Nintendo had been doing up to that point. They say thats what the Switch is. Its not. Wii U didnt throw all our established standards gear libraries and services out the window to start all over at square one. Switch did.Wii Us problem was that they handled it in the most boneheaded way possible. Not once did they try to improve at promoting it hell I could make a better ad than anything they put out and did But even so going into  the system itself was finally hitting its stride and had built up a respectable library especially after a stellar E . What do they do to capitalize on this? Drop the price? Improve the marketing? No. They announce NX at the Spring  investor meeting to mollify their idiot stockholders and doom Wii U to the Osborne effect when it had barely even been out for two years. Splatoon wasnt even out yet when we got that announcement. And all the thirdparties and even Nintendo themselves dropped the Wii U like a hot potato shortly after leaving all its buyers hanging which especially isnt helped by the fact that Switch is now getting enhanced ports of all these Wii U games in many cases within only even a couple of years of the initial version coming out. What message does that send to Wii U owners? Thats the kind of careless attitude I saw in the PStoPS or toXbone transitions but you know what?At least Sony attempted to turn PS around from its initial laughingstock reputation. It took them around four years to do it but they stuck with it and when they pulled it off the system even had another three healthy years after that. Microsoft has been making the same effort with the Xbone and they arguably had an even worse starting point with their disastrous E  and now three years in Xbone is doing okay for itself even integrating with their larger Win ecosystem. Nintendo threw up their hands and announced Wii Us successor after only two years and quietly started moving all their Wii U plans to that. And again I kinda feel like this is all because of what happened to Iwata. So that they could get his final legacy out. But he already had a legacy yet now theyre trying to act like Wii U never happened as they focus on the Switch. Honestly? I wish we could forget the Switch instead and go back to the Wii U.Sure its weaker and we cant take it outside.It still has a damn sight more going for it than the Switch does. From its library to its installbase to its compatibility with other Nintendo tech. Hell it even has an objectively better online for one thing I agree with Jim on how Miiverse was a stroke of goddamn genius but yknow what else? It was free.I dont wanna give up on the Wii U because the Switch isnt worth giving up on the Wii U for.,JimSterling,dciztzj,9,t5_2to10

10621577,0,t1_ddbeeux,Youre mixing up the s with the s.Ermmm... The s did not have quite a big selection of games... Maybe you mean the other media at that time? Regardless there were few popular with the gamers but not much in the corporate opinion bare that in mind.Metroid was released in the s and had two sequels in the s.I present to you the manual of the original metroid I shit ye not!It took SEGA until  to notice the demand and give us a female playable character...It wasnt until  where we got a playable female character at all....that was equal to Sonic.I am noticing a theme here...So now to MY point Considering the studio we are dealing with is Galaxy Trail which is an independent studio and is not under to the best of my knowledge corporate influence it is a question of curiosity considering current events. Many companies as has been noted by several critics with Jim among them considered female characters to not be fan favorite and came up with excuses to not include a female playable character. We still have several counter examples which I can list CoD while it doesnt have a female playable character a female in an attack helicopter is quite out of the ordinary. Mirrors Edge has a female protagonist.There is a thing about Faith Samus Aran Blaze the Cat and Lara Croft their personalities are more fit for battle than your typical stereotypical damsel in distress which is something to keep in mind beyond them just being female which what makes it part of the success. Yeah lets have a character that cries every  seconds and cant keep cool head... Yoshis island made me want to almost kill Mario.,JimSterling,ddbj9ub,0,t5_2to10

10854365,0,t1_ddyj11w,Ive reread my comment and came to the conclusion that it was not very well written. Therefore you misunderstood a few of my points. Im sorry for that.First of all I dont think it is necessarily wrong to trade used games. In fact I think it is a very important topic worthy of discussion. The message I wanted to convey was that I do think that oversimplifying the whole topic by comparing games to cars is not actually helping the discussion.  After rereading my post I dont think I conveyed that message very clearly.About point   I should have gone more in depth. What I mean with this point is that a car loses value to everyone by usage independant from who uses it. While a game loses some value over time just you playing it doesnt decrease the value the game holds for me.  About point   Again I was not in depth enough. What I meant was that the ratio of development costs to production costs is very different from games to cars. While a game has high development costs but very low production costs a car has comparatively high production costs.  This ratio might shift when technology advances. But even with a D printer you still need the raw material to produce the car. Even if we can produce cars for very cheap at some point in the future that means the ration changed and therefore maybe these products should be handled diffenetly. This ties into your mention of ebooks  When ebooks became a thing business models for books changed. Just because companies decided to change them doesnt validate those business models obviously. But it gives a decent indicator to that there is a need for discussing this topic.Your point about a cracked copy of a game having less value than a new copy is actually very interesting. And it also shows how complex the whole topic is.So in conclusion my opinion is Games are fundamentally different to cars. Therefore there is good reasoning for maybe treating them differently. The topic of IP and used games is a very important one worth of discussion and I think comparing two so fundamentally different things to each other is not helping the discussion.,JimSterling,ddzjucv,1,t5_2to10

How many people who are Sony fanboys like Sony games?  How many people who are haters enjoy the companies they hate games?

In the outlier cases emotions and biases are still MAJOR influencers just not  like the other cases.  ,JimSterling,deufsns,-16,t5_2to10

11454885,0,t1_dfudzv6,To expand on this a little more in case anyone is interested in how messed up everything can getAnything you create by default you are the only person who is legally allowed to . reproduce the copyrighted work. prepare derivative works based upon the work. distribute copies of the work to the public. perform the copyrighted work publicly. display the copyrighted work publiclyThis applies to anything you write. Any piece of art. Any video. Any song. Anything.Anyone else that wants to do those things with your work needs your express permission. This is usually done via licensing. Thats what the process of licensing is. It defines the terms under which you may do these things.For another example thats why Facebooks terms of service has to force you to give up your exclusive rights to the photos you upload. If they didnt it would be illegal for them to display your photos on their website even though youve just uploaded them.Just acquiring something doesnt automatically permit you any of these rights.This is also a good reason why you shouldnt just rip random code or images off of the internet to use in your projects.that list was ironically completely stolen from here,JimSterling,dfueij6,3,t5_2to10
