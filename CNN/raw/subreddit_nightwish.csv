Theres also a chatroom in Tuomas Official they have a radio station too and chat gets very fast when thats on.Edit also just in case youre not aware rsymphonicmetal is a thing too and we welcome any discussions.,nightwish,cql3zp5,2,t5_2sfhd
3811679,0,t1_cqqlc92,They didnt say.  But their FB page said that they are going to be filming a few more cities for the same release so I assume it wont be for several months at least.,nightwish,cqqrg2u,1,t5_2sfhd
3886355,0,t1_cpvkmeq,He definitely has a very distinct voice that can be kind of polarizing. I dont mind him in the albums hes been in so far but I must say in the Imaginaerum live his voice together with Floors is amazing. ,nightwish,cqza0tq,1,t5_2sfhd

5316814,0,t3_3nt6nv,I usually find being in the pit or very close to it and in the middle has the best sound at most shows I go to. Obviously when you are there the more intense the crowd is. Nightwish doesnt have too many crazy mosh pit type stuff going on at least so its easier than other shows.,nightwish,cvraaeg,1,t5_2sfhd

6393820,0,t1_czgbuv2,Not OC but I was at the Chicago show a few days before Anette left and in hindsight I wasnt too thrilled with the performance.More specifically it was Tuomas. If there was one member that didnt appear to be having a good time  it was him. I even caught him looking off the side of the stage and giving a clearly annoyed look to someone. The worst was when I saw him mouth the words Come on when either Empuu or Marco were doing a longerthannormal guitar solo.Everyone else was fine.Oh and if it were common for them to do an encore they didnt. I paid  for tickets and drove across two states to see the band. Even if youre pissed off about something put on a happy face for the . hours we have to watch you.,nightwish,czget3e,3,t5_2sfhd

11290665,0,t3_6154b0,Well that Dawkins thing is just the last album Angels Fall First actually had a song about Jesus.My favorite song is Dark Chest of Wonders which is a lot more fantasy based but I guess Im in the minority here. Also you cant go wrong with Wishmaster.,nightwish,dfbs3y5,13,t5_2sfhd
