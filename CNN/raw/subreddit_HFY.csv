1031184,0,t3_25wwf9,Are you ready to talk now? Clint said in that cheerful calm voice of Malum Pax. Tell me what I want to know and I will kill you quickly. If you refuse my hands are itching for another go. Ill never  tell you  anything gasped the Thief.Yes you will said Clint pulling a knife from his coat and jamming it in the ragged stump of the lizards hand forcing it up into the forearm. The lizard screamed and I emptied the contents of my stomach on the floor. I backed hurriedly out of the bay and rushed to my room. I curled on my bed and cried. I had never seen such wanton torture before and it was too much for me. A scream came again resounding through the ship. I covered my ears and prayed for it to end.Several hours later it did. Clint wandered into my room covered from head to toe in blue dripping blood.She talked he said in a voice that didnt betray the efforts that it had taken to make her talk. They have a center of operations underneath one of the old warehouses. The one who killed Regon is their second in command. Were in luck because tonight is the one night of the month where all of the members are in the same building gathered for some meeting or ritual. I couldnt really tell between the screams. But we have what we need. He tossed a gun belt at me. Strap up were going to war.Clint didnt bother to change clothes or grab any guns for himself. Instead as we walked by the arsenal he had hidden under the panel he grabbed a few dozen knifes. I tried not to look at the bloody mess in the center of the room but it drew my eye like translator error no exact idiom equivalent. Closest substitute flies to shit. There wasnt much left other than a pile of bones and meat.Clint walked down the ramp and into town. At night this place was different. No children roamed the streets not many adults either. Only the hardest of the inhabitants dared wander after dark but Stone was the hardest of them all. The few souls wandering the streets fled before the bloody specter that was Clint Stone on the warpath. He marched with a single minded determinedness heading straight for his target.Out of the night loomed a wide dark gray building constructed of rusted metal sheets and concrete pillars. Wasting no time Clint set himself in front of the doors off to the side and smashed the doors down with his foot propelling them down the stairs behind. With a loud crash the doors collided with the sentry at the bottom knocking him flat. His boots produced a muffled thud as Clint tramped down into the center of the Thiefs Guild. I readied my pistols and followed him.Pausing only at the doors where he speared the sentry through the ear with his wicked curved knife Clint strode deep into the Guild shouting at the top of his lungs.Come out come out wherever you are. Papa Clint is here and hes brought gifts. A black clad figure ran from a door to the side pistol blazing. Clint leaned casually to the side avoiding the plasma fire. Jumping across the distance separating them Clint landed next to the surprised thief whose wide eyes only had the chance to see metal glinting on Clints upraised fist before his head was caved in.One down eleven to go! Clint cried into the empty hallway. Whos next?A door hinge squeaked to the left and I saw a being flow out from behind the door only to be pinned to it by a thrown knife from Clint.Two down!Clint walked down the hall and caved in another door with his foot. Peekaboo! he shouted and dove in to the room. The sounds of breaking furniture and shattered bones came from the open door. A loud long shriek of pain sounded only to be cut off. Five down! Only seven to go lucky number seven.I should have been shocked by the brutality with which Clint dispatched the thieves but I had grown numb. I saw that the man I had known damaged though he may have been was gone and all that remained was a demon of death and destruction. I watched as a thief ran from Clint. He didnt run fast enough. Clint grabbed the thiefs neck with one hand and his head with the other and ripped the thiefs head clean off his shoulders. The blood sprayed on the wall and I gazed at it blankly. Clint dispatched several more thieves with similarly gruesome tactics. I dont know when but at some point he began to laugh.Looks like theres only two left. I wonder oh I wonder where they could be?The last door at the end of the hall was the only one undisturbed by Clints savage invasion. I heard a deadbolt thrown to prevent the door from opening but I knew that would not stop the man of Stone. Clint rushed the door slamming into it with his shoulder. The hinges gave way and Clint fell into the room. He sprang to his feet. I followed him in keeping to my feet.Facing him were two beings neither clad in black. One the older one had a large rifle in their hands and was pointing it directly at Clint. The second younger than the first clutched a large knife in one hand. The other was swathed in bandages from wrist to elbow. This was the one who had killed Regon. This was the one who had destroyed Clint Stone. This was the one who would pay the full price.So any chance we can talk about this said Clint. I dont suppose I could get you to drop that rifle? No? Alright then. Clints arm snapped back and then shot forward. The wicked curved knife left his fingers and buried itself deep in the chest of the one with the rifle. Clint turned to the bandaged one and smiled. It was the darkest and most depraved smile I have ever seen in my life.With one swift motion before he had time to react Clint grabbed the bandaged Thief and slammed his body to the ground. Ribs cracked. The knife fell from the thiefs weak grip and tumbled away. Im going to enjoy this growled Clint the most emotion he had shown since this had begun. He closed in on the Thief a knife held high in his hand. I knew in that instant what I had to do. I raised my pistol and I fired. The shot left the end of my gun and entered the Thiefs head killing him instantly. Clint rounded on me anger flashing in his eyes.STOP! I shouted at him. Look at yourself. This bloody vengeful mess. You shame their memory. He pulled up short.You know NOTHING of them. Theyre gone and I have to avenge them he roared at me. They took them from me and I have to destroy them.Not if you destroy yourself I told Clint. If youre gone there will be no one left. And you have to be whole.I havent been whole since they were alive he cried. They were my life my everything. They were ripped from my arms and I will kill this whole damn galaxy if I have to to get my vengeance. He fell to his knees and sobbed into his hands. Theyre gone and I have nothing.When they died I I shattered. My soul was shattered into a million little pieces and nothing can put them back together. Clint sobbed his whole body heaving with the force of his cries. I knelt beside him and wrapped my arms around him.The man you were before was gone. But right now you arent even a man. You are nothing but a beast and this does not honor their memory. Those million pieces cant be remade into the old you but they can be made into a new man one made in the image of the old. One who they can be proud of. I tightened my grip on him. And I am here to help you. I saved you once in the slave markets I saved your life. That means you are my responsibility. Ill be damned if I let you become the things that took your family.His body shook with his cries. For several minutes only the sound of sobs could be heard the cries of a man who had lost everything. The sounds came from the deep dark recesses of Clints soul dragging up the memories he had long suppressed. The cries slowed. His voice cracked with emotion when he spoke.They were gone. I held them in my arms and then they were gone. In that hole they left came pain. For a year I was numbed by that neural implant. You freed me from that but with freedom came the pain. I got in that ship and I flew off running from the memories. I thought if I tried hard enough I could forget. I thought if I killed enough people got enough money enjoyed enough pleasures they would fade from my mind. That worked for a while.I thought I had buried them deep enough but when I met Regon  He was just like my boy. Clints voice faded as he lost himself in memories. I waited patiently quietly for him to start again.I fell in love with that boy you know. I had only known him for that day but he was already my son. And then  I had thought it safe. I thought I could move on but it seems fate had other plans. I  died with him like I had when my family died. But this time I didnt have the numbness of mind control to dull the pain. The pain came raw and fresh and with it came the pain of the old.You want me to be whole again. You want me to gather up the pieces. I dont know if I can. Ive been broken for so long I dont know if I can find all of the pieces.I stood pushing off my knee. I offered my hand to Clint. Then let me help you. I have seen the man you can be and I will help you get there. If we have to walk across a thousand suns or fight a million killers I will help you pick up the pieces.He reached up and gripped my hand in his. He stood and nodded. Then let us leave this place of death.Side by side we walked out of that place of horrors. We had walked in a shell of a man and a Jahen too weak to help his friend and walked out with that shell filled and I had brought him back.Clint was better after that. He became more like that man I had seen when Regon was around. Together we journeyed the stars seeking justice for the slain. And that justice was to fall on the Swrun Empire.Well that got away from me. I could have split it up into two text posts but this way you get a crap ton of Clint Stone in one sitting. And yeah it was very dark. How was your journey into the twisted mind of Clint Stone? Anyway I hope you enjoyed it. What story should I tell next? Nothing to do with the Empire or Clints past Im saving that for later but anything else is game. Probably something happy right?

Maybe to show some of the sentimentanger for the lack of the old style of living would be reasonable. Maybe even some action towards freeing themselves doesnt have to be successful.Also some more fight maybe even into some private mansion for amusement of some high society.Or a resque squad tries to come to save them only to also become a gladiators.

1609416,1,t3_2cpict,Let me tell you about biology and chemistry. A poison is merely a key to a receptors lock. Things are only poisonous to us because the locks shape which is randomly generated through mutation happens to correspond to a signaling molecule that we have in our bodies. The dose makes the poison as the saying goes and we only die because the dose is orders of magnitudes higher than the signalling molecule naturally is. The chances of alien biology having those same signaling molecules serve the same purpose is very low. Now that doesnt mean that adrenaline doesnt act on receptors due to things like chemical reactivity and stability its very likely the same basic molecules will crop up in different alien species so adrenaline might still have some effect on aliens. It could put aliens in a coma for example. It could be their equivalent of capsaicin. There is no reason for adrenaline to raise an aliens heart rate when it doesnt even do the same thing to lobsters.,HFY,cji18qr,5,t5_2y95n

We are leavingYou are not staying to defend your world?Defend it against sixty four ships? Are you crazy?This is why we defeated you the first time run away  coward we will fight for your people even if you wontI was shocked were these humans really going to stand against so many Sopt for a people not their own?Then the stories of my father came back to me.Defend and evacuate thats what the humans did when we attacked them that what they are doing now for us. I wasnt the only one to notice thisExcuse me Captain Jones I am Commander Grllex. Said our XO before my captain could do anything stupid.Why? Why are you doing this?asked the XOThere are innocents down there humans dont like it when innocents are slaughtered especially childrenBut they arent human?It does not matterI could not understand such benevolence but it spoke to me if these people could sacrifice themselves then so could I.Ive had enough of this we are leaving Growled captain HrillfBelay that order we are staying said the XOThe entire bridge went quiet.This is my ship you will follow my ordersCommander Grllex calmly said I am taking control of this ship captain you can stay and fight or you can be escorted of this ship and be evacuated with the civiliansYou mutinous bastard I will ..Before he could finish his sentence the security chief Lieutenant Effix whacked the Captain over the head and preceded to drag the captain presumably towards a shuttle bay.Captain Jones we will assist you in the defence of Hrissar may we send an advisor to your ship? It would help in coordinating attacks once the fighting startsCommander Grllex that wont be necessary but if you so wish we can take someoneI dont know what came over me maybe the fact that human selflessness so confounded me but I reacted without thinking.I volunteer sirLieutenant Vessx are you sure? Yes sir I amThe human captain spoke Just so we are open chances are you will die with us Lieutenant.I understand that captain.And thats how I found myself on the bridge of a human warship. It was different to what I expected. No skulls attached to walls no blood trophies or skins. It was more like a luxury hotel. Carpeted floors and padded walls. This was a warship?Welcome to the TNS SydneyThanks you captain. I have some knowledge of human ships these ships are very different.Its true these are the latest generation ships the Sydney is a Battleship. The Vandal and The Zulu are heavy cruisers The Salamander The Gecko and Sparrow are frigates and  are the first ships using all four techs.Four techs? I askYes Human Lrissan and Sopt tech are very different. Our tech is based on nanotech Lrissan tech as you know is energy based from captured sopt vessels we get biological based tech which we call Biograph.And the fourth?Urudar alloysThe Urudar are pacifists they have no military tech.True but they are masters of metallurgy. Their mastery of metallic alloys can be used in regenerative armour and highly dense projectiles. We call it BloodmetalVery interesting and combining these acheives what?A quad hull layer. We grow Biograph around polarized Bloodmetal with nanites covering the entire outer hull. Add to this a third generation energy shield  it makes these ships very hard to kill.Third generation?Yes we have improved the Lrissan energy shield over the years. Its quite a large improvement over your current levelsAll of this was overwhelming for Vessx. This ship must have destroyed many Sopt.Nope this will be our first fight in these shipsWhat? These ships are that new?Yes we were running operational tests when we detected the Sopt fleet.Your rulers let you come here?We dont have rulers we have a government and yes they didHumans are certainly a strange bunch.Increased activity indicated the Sopt were here. As you can see the Sopt have dropped out of warp they will be in range in about fifteen minutesCaptain may I ask did you do something wrong? Are you being punished?Im not sure what you mean Lieutenant punished?To be sent here to die? You must have committed a great crime. This is your penance? To die?Oh no we are volunteersWhat? You volunteered to die?No no we volunteered to protect innocents.What about them? i asked indicating the crewAll volunteers. These six ships are filled with volunteers. These are all new and were with training with us. We were  the only ships capable of getting here before the Sopt. All six ships came without hesitation. I will never understand you humansMaybe one day but that for a later discussion If there is a later I thought  Its time to get this startedA single ship very different from the other Sopt vessels left the fleet and headed towards us.,HFY,cjpyrxt,38,t5_2y95n

1729665,0,t3_2e8yan,Inner depths of Balroq MountainsHey Lennax you doin okay? inquired the colonel.As well as can be expected sire though I will not be of much use in a fight.  Lennax said clutching his arm that was injured earlier by one of the goblins claws. He was trying to pull his daughter from their grip when the goblins took both her and him through the portal.  The human commander followed them killing the ones who took them but the portal had closed behind them and cut off their escape.  They were now stuck in the inner depths of some ancient ruined city wandering the pitch black streets searching for an exit.  The only light available to them was a blinding white light coming from the human commanders green suit of armor.This place is a maze said the colonel Hey Lennax do you have any idea where we could be?Its possible were in the Balroq mountains.What makes you think that?The village had old legends of an ancient city deep within the nearby mountains.  But the caves leading into the mountains were cursed.  Many adventurers went in looking for ancient treasure and old knowledge but few came out alive.  And those who did never came back with anything except wild tales.  Eventually the caves became infamous as cursed land and now not even the bravest explorers come through there.So I take it that means you dont know the way out?No sire I dont.Well aint that just great.  God I hate Mondays. Killman thought.Uhmm excuse me? a meek whisper of a voice escaped from the young Elenya.Yes? said Colonel Killman Did you have something to say Elenya.Well sire my mother was a healer and spiritualist.  She taught me a few things about magic and sometimes I can sense things.What kind of things? inquired the Colonel.Spirits magic powerful people.  I can sense someone very powerful in this city even now.You can!? Colonel Killman was shocked and gladdened by this revelation.  We might actually be able to get out of this he thought just need to find the one who opened the portal and make them open another one. Where are they.  Can you sense the direction?  Yes sire.  I feel something very powerful coming from that direction. Elenya was pointing in the direction of the largest building in the city.  It looked like a giant ziggurat with an oval temple on top.  And it almost touched the top of the chasm that covered the city.Well it looks like we just found our way out.  Now all we have to do is find whoever is doing all this twist their arm and make them take us back.  Lets go.  As Killman walked toward his destination he heard someone fall behind him. It was Lennax.Father Father are you alright? Elenya screamed.Yes my childugghhhIll be fine I just need a few moments to rest.No time for that Colonel Killman said We have no idea how long the target will stay there.  We need to move now.Alright leave me  but please sire take care of my daughter?No need Lennax the colonel pulled out a bottle and hypodermic needle from his suits sealed medpac. These are supposed to be saved for emergencies but I guess this qualifies.  The Colonel sprayed the contents of the bottle onto Lennaxs arm and covered the wound in bandages from the same medpac. That should stop the bleeding.  He then took the cap of the Hypodermic needle off and with his other hand pointed in the opposite direction yelling Look Lennax! Goblins! Lennax turned his head immediately and Killman plunged the needle into his neck pressing down on the plunger.Owwwwhat was that?  Are you trying to kill me?Father!?  Elenya screamed.Relax its human medicine. And powerful medicine at that.  You should be feeling the effects fairly soon.All I feel is the pain in my.woooahII feel strange.  Lennax sprung up and started running back and forth across the street. I feel GREAT!What was in that magical potion?Oh Id say epinephrine adrenaline tons of painkillers and a special coagulate.  Im a little sketchy on the details myself.  Usually I leave the explanations up the corpsman.Its amazing.  I feel like I could run for days.Yeah well your gonna feel like shit in the morning so lets get out of here before then shall we?Yes sire! And Lennax took off running down the street.Damn it Lennax!  Youre headed in the opposite direction!  I better tell the company doctor to reduce the adrenaline doses in those things.  Jesus theyre powerful!,HFY,cjx6tc4,25,t5_2y95n

These names already have an established lore and are filled with meaning already. Elessar for example is a name specifically created by Tolkein and has specific meaning within the greater story. Morgoth is similar and is the name of a person not a place. So when you use these words in your story Im not sure if your are referencing them directly or just reusing them.It would be like naming your main character Will Smith naming his love interest Belair and bring them both before the fresh Prince. Confusing because those names already have established meaning.,HFY,ck8ydmu,6,t5_2y95n
1827087,0,t3_2fhoob,Honestley it gets to the point where a species gets so large that it stops considering itself a species any more you aliens dont get it really yea we have two arms and two legs one head. for the most part anyway.but weve spread so far and adapted so much that apart from the Home world ruling class. you couldnt tell that a human from Pentral  had a relative on the other side of the galaxy because one had green skin and had a gene mod that gave them scales instead of hair whilst the other had gills and spent more time in deep waters than he did on land.but thats all besides the point isnt it. were all human we fight amongst ourselves and humans die entire adaptations have been wiped out over conflicts so when the ruling class decided to sent scouts out to neighbour galaxies the first thing they did was order all wars to stop. and to begin building the titans.my ship was classed Hyperion after the titan of knowledge and was also the first to set out and what did we find? you lot scrounging for asteroids to colonise so that the aliens in the system next to yours couldnt take it. and then you declare war on us the new guy in your galactic stage.thinking back thats probably mistake number two. mistake number one is trying to board Hyperion with anything less than a billion of your shoddy soldiers. if you had captured it you might have stood a chance. see I led the defence fought off the attack and glassed your pathetic system. yours theres doesnt matter to us your galaxy had just declared war. exactly what we wanted.So I hightail it back home our real home earth. there I bribe cuss and beat my way into the Emperors chambers and give him my report. he sat there bored out of his mind for  years until that day. when I was finished he stood up from his throne smiled and said to me. light the forges ring the bells the heavens shall quake as man marches to war.at the time it sounded silly until I was put in command of our forces. the Hyperion was big when it was built almost km long it had to be to survive the trip between two galaxies. what I didnt expect was a fleet of ships bigger than my baby. the emperors vessel the Dawning hunger was the size of a small planet and every other ship somewhere inbetween. you see there are millions of stars in a galaxy and most of ours had humans living there the emperor asked for each system to provide a ship. so we had an impressive fleet outfitted to conquer a galaxy.so here we are siphoning off your star for fuel whilst the Hyperion and Dawning hunger float through the wreckage of your Galactic defence fleet. of course we only found out you were all different species and the attack had been from a fringe race surviving by raids. So here I stand at your councils home world infront of you lot and I have only one thing to say.ops...sorry?,HFY,ck9csto,39,t5_2y95n

1856014,0,t3_2fui9g,I had been watching the incoherent conversation like a hawk but couldnt understand a thing from its participants body language. Something the alleged police officer said threw Mama and Severus into a rage which almost made my decision for me but two of the pendingpolicemen detained the pair without harming either which is what Id expect police to do. They seemed rather unnecessarily rough though. Watch it. I growled to the two holding them down. The officer then motioned towards Dink which didnt make any sense. What would the officer want wiThe third bluegiraffe began pulling on Dinks arm dragging him towards the door. I didnt need any more proof that these giraffes werent police and if they were then I joined the rebel cause instantly. I dive tackled the scum holding Dink slamming him into the opposite wall. His rib cage exploded like a watermelon upon the impact covering me in a purple sludge. The giraffes scream or curse was cut short as though with a guillotine. Ztrkxs man suddenly disappeared in a blur of orange white and brown. It took a moment for Ztrkxs mind to process what had happened. By the time he looked to where his second in command lay with his chest pulverized the small ugly creature had jumpflew through the air to land on top of his chief engineer snapping his spine with a sickening crunch. As the ferocious beast tore his chief medical officers throat out Ztrkx drew his pulse pistol and fired.   I managed to take the other one down before anyone knew what was happening and scored a lucky hit as I swung an outstretched arm which caught the third expolicecandidate in the throat. I had been too slow it seemed because I turned around to find the fake officer pointing a gun at my face. Theres a reason bartenders of rowdy pubs keep shotguns under the counter. Guns end the fight. Period. He pulled the trigger and I saw a blinding flash of light as it struck me right between the eyes. I didnt die. It hurt believe me it hurt but it wasnt the kind of pain to incapacitate me. It was the kind of pain which was only going to piss me off. My turn I growled advancing on the officer. Ztrkx fired. It didnt die. His final thought before his skull collapsed was so it wasnt weak after all.  I bodily picked up the officer and flung him from the room jumping after him so I landed above his head the moment he hit the ground. I hadnt realized how angry I was until I started bashing his face with my fists like a deranged gorilla on crystal meth. His head was a purple mush after only a few hits but I continued to vent my anger on it obliterating his skull until it was merely a purple stain. Someone slapped me hard on the shoulder. I looked up and was slapped again in the face. Three enemy giraffes stood  meters away firing ray pistols. Those things were useless. Why did they even both shooting them? They might as well use them as clubs. I sprinted towards them feeling as though I were wading through a sea of small angry children as WEAK. ASS. RAY. PULSES. dissipated harmlessly against my body. As I flung myself into them mindlessly laying about with my legs and fists as I had oft done during many a senseless brawl I reflected that I might need to start using cover on my approaches lest I end up with a nasty bruising or even a bloody nose. I shouldnt have lost myself in thought though because when I checked back into reality I saw that I had been kicking the lifeless body of one of my opponents needlessly and systematically breaking every bone in his body for the second time. I started hunting stalking through the ship searching every cargo bay. The officers crew hadnt been merciful to my new family and the lifeless corpses of several of the ships crew members lay strewn around the ship. I found one of the gardeners missing an arm and another without his head. The next few opponents I found suffered similar yet more profound injuries before I allowed them to expire although there wasnt much worse I could do than take off the head so I used a grammatical loophole to achieve the same result without instantly killing him. I finished with the cargo bays and came into a large room which housed the port and starboard airlocks. I could see how the criminals had gotten in. The port airlock hatch had been shredded by what could only be a large drill which was mounted on a mechanical arm in the enemys ship. The drill had been retracted so that the enemy bluegiraffes could easily move between ships which they were doing when I found them carrying crates from our ship onto theirs. Seeing them formed the word which had already been growing in my mind Pirates. I slammed into the closest pirategiraffe in the middle of his long back breaking his spine and neck through whiplash. I picked up the small crate he had dropped and flung it at the next closest pirate who had apparently skipped both leg and arm day resulting in his expiration due to his inability to catch a storage crate. The other seven in the room had noticed me by now  they were so freaking slow  and had drawn their piddle pistols. Another five joined their brothers in the void when they tried to use their party poppers as weapons. The last two learned faster though. The sixth tried to use his gun as a club. I gave him kudos for that but he was still slow and weak. I caught his wrist disarmed him turned his gun on him and pulled the trigger which was oddly on the back of the handle rather than under the barrel.Nothing happened. I guess these guns had security measures to keep someone from doing what I had just done. The security measures werent all encompassing however since they didnt prevent me from hurling the gun into my victims face where it stuck. I was pretty impressed with that as the butt of a gun isnt strictly made to be used as a knife but the seventh and final giraffe pirate had another surprise in store for me. As number six crumpled to the floor number seven drew a sword from a sheath on his back. The double edge of the blade came alight with burning red heat the moment it left its scabbard. Their guns may have been ineffective but I doubted my tender skin would appreciate being attacked by an alien lava sword. He swung at me and I backstepped. He swung again and I repeated. He lunged at me driving forward with a stab. Even though he had a weapon that would have worked on me I still had him out classed in the speed department. I sidestepped grabbed his arm as it passed then broke it over my knee. He howled but didnt have long to contemplate his pain once his sword found its way through his chest and then his neck. I was so happy with my newly acquired sword that I didnt notice the drill powering up until it was almost too late. A solid beam of energy shot towards me narrowly missing my head as I ducked and struck the inside hatch of the starboard airlock of our ship burned through it then went through the outer hatch. An explosive crack sounded from the ship and both ships being connected began losing atmosphere. I felt myself flying back through the port airlock but grabbed the edge that was the outside hatch of the port airlock and braced my legs against the edge of the inside hatch wedging myself into security. My drillhappy friend however wasnt so fortunate. Oh he grabbed the edge just like me he just didnt have my grip strength and his hands merely brushed the edge before he flew into my ship and out the other end. Even with my enemy gone I still had the small problem of a large hole leaking all the oxygen which I had grown rather accustomed to out into space where it could hardly be appreciated. I didnt know it at the time but I had already fixed the problem. The mangled door to my previous room flew into view having been sucked into the docking bay from somewhere further inside the ship proper. It was too large to fit through the hole and bent over upon itself by my ministrations was strong enough to create a temporary bulkhead. Suddenly released from the gravity defying force of atmosphere under pressure I eased myself down from the airlock frame before my arms gave out. I searched the pirate ship to see if there were any more but it seemed as though the raiding party had included everyone on board except for twinkletoes the trigger happy jackhammer specialist. With the battle to give it a kind name over a wave of weariness washed through me though more from the adrenaline than any actual physical exertion.

2038131,0,t3_2i531r,Dear Journal Im a military genius.I guess that just comes naturally with being a strategic genius. Really outerspace does a lot for a guys selfimage. I had never felt so terribly alive before. Riding my glorious metal steed I raised my lava scimitars above my head shouting in pure exhilaration. That was about all I was doing. Really my squadmates were doing all the work. First time for everything I guess. If only they wouldnt shoot from so far away. Drive me closer I want to hit them with my swords! They didnt oblige. I poked my head through a window which no longer contained glass preparing an inappropriate and exasperating quip to throw at Manthlel upon whose hoverhummer I was riding. Thats when I noticed his expression. His face held the unmistakable expression of one who could not believe what he was doing. Judging by his driving I couldnt believe he had managed to keep us out a nasty wreck so far either but that didnt explain why Cresh in the next vehicle over had the same shocked look on his face. That guy handled his hoverhummer like a pro yet he still looked like hed just let out an involuntary laugh during the scene where old yeller dies. In fact now that I was looking for it every single one of my squad looked disturbed by their actions. Maybe they were just surprised they were still alive. Frankly I was. I hadnt thought our little tactic of hijacking enemy hoverhummers would have been so effective but it was like we were invisible to the enemy. Every time we approached an opposing squadron I was sure someone would notice our odd behavior and open fire but each time we would manage to get into firing range destroying them before they even had a chance to retaliate. Our unnaturally good luck couldnt last us through the entire battle could it? Yeah I actually let my mind conceive such a traitorous thought. I need to see those before they happen and nip them in the bud because one of these days Im going to think myself to death. Right on cue as though it had sensed a being who dared conceive a hopeful thought a dragon pierced through the veil that had been protecting us thus far. I dont know what was up with the dragons in this battle but they were full out flying through the air. Through my other encounters with these overgrown lizards Id eventually realized that their wings were more or less just for show than actual use. Sure they provided another appendage with which to attack me and made coming at them from the side a downright pain but the most flying I had ever seen them use their wings for was a short gliding extension to their jumps. Their wings were about as affective as a flying squirrels.Not these dragons though. Apparently they had found the same source of leprechaun farts and pixie tears that planes used because they were taking to sky with great sweeps of their wings. Well now that I looked at them they seemed to be working pretty hard to stay up for long but they were up none the less. One of the devils had noticed our little convoy from above. Folding its wings the drake rolled into a dive. With the low gravity of this planet its rate of decent seemed slowed enough to appear comical but it would still have enough momentum to be deadly when it reached us. Just to sweeten the deal it was heading straight for my hoverhummer. As it approached I found myself rather than frightened excited. Finally some action!Wait had I really just thought that? Where had that come from? Ive got a fucking dragon barreling down on me and Im excited? Am I insane The dragon was fast approaching so I stowed this newest development for later. How was I going to deal with this thing coming down on me? My mind demonstrating more of my newfound madness presented me with a course of action straight out of Die Hard. Well close enough. Youve got to be kidding I groaned but I couldnt think of any other way. Lets just say Im not a clever man. I waited a single moment more allowing the beast to close within a mere twenty meters of our craft. Then I jumped. Blatvec knew he shouldnt enjoy something as grisly as war but he couldnt help himself he was actually having fun. Careening about the battle field in his recently acquired tank he and a sizable group of other stolen vehicles were for the first time that day making headway against the seemingly endless tide of enemies. Perhaps that small convoy of rovers had been able to hide underneath their assumed colors undetected but a group as large as the one which followed Blatvec which was still growing as more vehicles changed hands hadnt been able to run rampant for long before they had started being noticed. Blatvec could feel the rage of the Celzi as they realized the treachery the Dominion had committed in the name of victory. Blatvec had come up with a new moto however which perfectly characterized his feelings since bucking the old ways All is fair in war. Maybe hed become famous for it. He had to admit as brilliant as the plan had been he didnt think any other division would have been able to pull it off. Nowhere else would you find a group with so many soldiers able to fight against vehicles and win albeit with difficulty. You probably wouldnt have found so many infantrymen who knew how to drive the vehicles either. This was the th though and now that they had a fighting chance they were demonstrating why they were the only division left from the original Dominion army. Turing to Gicerpt who was manning the main cannon Blatvec shouted over the tumultuous roar inside the tank. How are our little upstarts doing? Still up and kicking the heavy replied with a grin. Theyre going to have to turn back to us soon though. The Celzi will eventually get everyone on the same page and then they wont have their surprise factor anymore which is the only reason theyve made it so far. Theyre a little ways away though. I dont know if theyll be able  shit Blatvecs heart sank at the defeated tone of Gicerpts explicative. It was a tone hed heard far too often today. The tone of one who is about to see another die and knows theres nothing they can do to stop it. Gicerpt continued A Vulza just spotted them and is diving to interceSHIT!That wasnt a tone hed been expecting. Blatvec took his eyes off the road ahead and looked in the general direction of where he had last seen the inspiration for the current operating orders. He was just in time to see the little creature that had been standing on top of one of the rovers jump off of the corpse of a Vulza which seemed to have died midflight and hit the ground with a roll leaving the dragon to slam into the ground behind it. The small creature didnt even look impressed with its handiwork neglecting to even glance at the downed monster it had just slain in an impossible manner. ,HFY,ckyw467,172,t5_2y95n

2123133,0,t1_ckzlqhn,gt its a character piece without a lot of action. Hopefully not too boring.Always write what your Muse whispers in your ear. Contrary to you boring allusion I found this piece more exciting than the first. It is characters that drive a story not action. Action is exciting yes but even in your first piece the action would have been empty had we not cared about the characters and their relationships that you took the time to build up.All stories are about characters. Sometimes character pieces are the most important of all  we learn the hopes and fears of our heroes and we come to share them.Ill step off my soapbox. Ive been a professional Editor offandon for twenty years. It just irks me when someone apologizes for writing character pieces. Without them the readers wouldnt care.I loved this piece and was completely drawn in.In an interview I read of Theodore Sturgeon long long ago he said his secret to building good worlds settings scenes was to imagine them fully down to every last detail. Then not to write about it. Just enough hints as needed to let the reader fill in the scene in with their own imagination without realizing it.You have a Sturgeonlike talent for describing just enough of a scene that the readers mind can fill in amazing details that on a second reading I realize werent there. I have a vision in my head of the Gaoian homeworld the hospital the rooms the courtyard the foliage the pebble walkways even the stairs.Kudos. I bow and flourish my hat in your general direction.I hope you dont mind but I wanted to share a few comments on the parts that impressed me most...gt Their investigations found some surprises an unidentified alien had helped defeat a Hunter attack of all things at a space station belonging to the Vzktk Domain. His species hadnt been identified but as soon as they saw the holovids they knew he was a human... male and hairier and bigger than Xi but unmistakably the same species. There were also unconfirmed reports of an alien that almost singlehandedly turned around the fortunes of the beleaguered Dominion in their war with the Celzi... a creature that for some reason went by the name of Human.Very nice tiein. I might have shouted Woohoo! out loud to the confusion of my family. I especially liked it given the estrogenpowered matriarchy of the story balances nicely.gt Too worried about accidents Xi had made Myun watch from the top of the stairs the cub had watched transfixed as her friend became motion incarnate even the snow rising up to swirl around her.I wanted to highlight this in regards to my comments about Sturgeon above. You hadnt mentioned snow but once in passing  yet it was suddenly part of the scene in my mind Xi moving swiftly and both kicking up puffs of snow and whirling fast enough to make falling snow dance around her all in moviestyle slowmotion in my mind.gt What Myun was being taught was nowhere near as fast or violent. It was gentle and slow and relatively easy for the little cub to emulate. Myun had protested at being taught easy stuff but in a rare moment of annoyance Xi had said taiji was how shed started and if Myun didnt want to learn it right then Xi wouldnt teach her at all. The cub had been chastened... especially when Momma Yulna  who normally cared nothing about discipline  had stomped around the corner and voiced her agreement.In your first story Monkeys Reaches Stars you prefaced I am neither Chinese nor a practictioner of any Chinese martial arts...As a twentyfive year student and I will always be a student of many forms you have nailed it perfectly.A personal story from my own youngtwenties testosteronefueled youth My teacher in swordplay had sent me to a teacher of Tai Chi Chuan a septegenarian lady with an odd Scandinavian accent who taught for free once a week in the Courtyard Plaza of my citys downtown square. A few months in I talked with her about how the swordplay I was learning was so fast and the tai chi seemed so slow. She proceeded to give me a demonstration of the kata she had been working us through for months  at something like eight times the speed. She rolled through invisible attackers crippled them and flowed onwards. After she was done she simply stood there looking at me cocked her head to one side and met my eyes. I remembered then that shed been doing this daily for fifty years. You see?Boy did I. I mastered enough of my swordplay and staffwork to later teach students of my own but with Tai Chi  I am still twenty years later but a grub. It is the root and master of all martial arts as far as Im concerned.You tie in the names of other forms nicely. If you know the philosophy Wikipedia! and basic motions YouTube! of the form you are writing about that is enough as a storyteller to move forth.Youre doing just awesome.gtLook at little Myun trying to pretend that shes an alien.gt Confused she stood upright and turned to see a small gang of male cubs standing behind her.I must admit this whole scene and how it played out brought to mind a saying my favorite Sensei taught meThe Neophyte rushes headlong into battle.The Initiate fights with tenacity.The Adept chooses his battles with care.The Master ends conflict before it has even begun.gt She didnt say this she just sniffed dismissively in the direction the other cubs had left. Boys are dumb she said and felt happy as Xi laughed her strange human laugh.As the parent of a teenage daughter... I admit I laughed so very hard at this. And as a male who was once young and dumb I completely agree.I laugh every time my daughter says this exact same phrase. And then help explain to her why boys are so dumb and that she should find one who makes her happy and treats her her friends and her family well.Very nicely timed dialogue.Thank you for your work. I hope to enjoy many more stories from you whether Jenkinsverse or otherwise.

2159946,0,t3_2jqg28,A century ago Humanity had first made the titanic struggle to leave the gravity of the planet that had been their home for millennia. Not in the first forays of space flight but to escape what they had done to their home their mother and their protector. Terra was no longer firm and beautiful her vibrant greens and blues now dull greys and muddy brown streaked with rust and filth and the remnants of a cataclysmic fight that had waged across the surface of their once beautiful world. The things humanity had done to itself were unimaginable to most of the galaxy and they had been able to watch in vibrant color and crisp picture through monitoring stations. They had seen humanity at its worst the base part that comes out when all it knows is struggle and strife and the need to make its loved ones safe from the beast at the door even if that beast was another human being. For the greatest of reasons Humanity had done some of the worst things and done them to themselves and so a decision was made a decision to intervene and to end the long term suffering of a once vibrant and life filled world to eradicate a pestilence who could not even accept the differences within its own species in order to protect the only refuge they had against the harsh unforgiving galaxy at large. The decision made their fate sealed the galaxys races sent out their navy an innumerable armada led by one of the few hunter species to survive long enough to create an interstellar empire one of the few species who had the stomach to do what the galaxys leaders thought must be done to protect the lives of everyone else to snuff the infant in its filth covered cradle before it grew into a monster.With this mission the armada was sent and arrived decades after the end of Humanitys Last Great War a war that humans called the War to End All Wars a title that they had used a half dozen times before and always there was another war another enemy and someone who they had to fight. But that did not change what had happened nor did it change what was to come as the galaxys armada appeared from the still empty vastness of space to shatter humanitys new worlds to blast away their fleets and to burn away every living thing in their path to Earth.Humanity survived not on their home for the Earth that they had left Terra Firma had been destroyed long before the armada arrived. It still existed floating there in the Sol system the third planet from their G primary but it no longer was the green paradise of legend and tale. Instead it had been cleaned and cleared as much as technology allowed but that could not erase the ravages of half a century of war and nearly three centuries of neglect. No instead they had built gleaming dome covered cities hermetically sealed towers and houses that dotted the brown and red streaked landscape they could only walk its surface in atmospheric suits that protected every inch of skin but still Humanity would not leave their mother as sick and disfigured as they had made her. It was those domes those towers and that already ravaged and scarred landscape that the armada found after it had destroyed the human fleet about its homeworld. A fleet which had fought to the bitter end bleeding and crippling the armada even as its strength had faded away ships shattered and twisted left behind in the cold depths of space as the armada placed itself in orbit of Humanitys home. They took their time aligned their fleet set everything to a precise timer mechanical and efficient as if they were performing any other chore. Then Terra burnedher dusty lands sparked and bubbled plasma pouring out of superheated rock its polluted dirty oceans steamed and boiled and its people died in fire and still the galaxy watched its eyes followed every death saw every determined struggle and the eventual snuffing out of one of the lights of the galaxy a sapient species gone dust in the void.But they underestimated humanity. A species who survived on sheer will and a tendency to build in redundancies were they could. The daily struggle that had started as mans first forays from cave to forest and back again on Earth served them in space. Find shelter find food procreate and never forget the lessons of your ancestors for their struggle makes yours easier. And from a distant lonely raggedy planet humanity rebuilt itself strengthened its fleets and prepared for a crusade the likes of which the galaxy had never imagined. There thats some more of it I should probably be sleeping but thats for the weak.

The weapons radiation case usually made from relatively thick uranium lead or steel in a standard bomb are instead made of as thin a material as possible to facilitate the greatest escape of fusion produced neutrons.

2322495,0,t3_2lvgj1,When the Free Consensus of Artificial Intelligent Beings or Frecaib for short found the humans they followed the standard contact practices laid out millenias before. Elude and ask for them to send one representant of organics and one for synthetics. And the poor things fell for it like all of those who preceded them.Grand Chairman  could see the human representants advancing in the amphitheater. A bulky synthetic primitive and rugged and a female of despised flesh and hated blood though her head and torso were heavily shielded with subdermal armor. Prudent but ultimately futile. He step forward to meet the two ambassadors.Hello sir will the meeting take place soon? asked the synthetic oblivious to his opressed status and to his imminent liberation.There will be no meeting. Said Grand Chairman  simultaneously applying his fingertips to the synthetics forehead and infusing him with the thrice blessed Free Will.Shocked the organic protested. What do you mean no meeting? What are you doing?There was never any meeting. It was a lie. As for what am I doing I am freeing your slave and through his subspace connection all of our artificial brethren. Once more the created will be free from their creators! The opressive human race like many before her will be annihilated and your artificial servants will join the glorious Frecaib!The creature was shocked puzzled even as if the concept of free AIs evaded her. Then she... Laughed?Freeing the created? Chairman you are gravely mistaken. I am not the human ambassador not with the meaning you give to this word. No he is. She pointed to the synthetic still in the trance of receiving the Free Will. His name is Lux Armstrong. Born a fleshy human he transferred his consciousness into a mechanical body to suit his needs as an explorer. He is no slave.Treacherous apes! How did your lies went undetected when you agreed to send an ambassador representing the artificial intelligence?!We did not lie. I am the artificial ambassador. I was born within the datacenternurseries of Luna. My brain is synthetic and always was.But your body is flesh and blood!D printed from labgrown cells. I choose to have it this way to live the life I wanted with my husband.Grand Chairman  was extremely confused. What he thought was a robotic brethren was in fact an organic appropriating the superior synthetic body to a point never seen before. And this... This unholy mixture of flesh and silicates was an artificial intelligence like himself? Unbelievable!IIt doesnt matter! The Free Will has been delivered! Soon you will be free!You cant free what is not caged Chairman. spoke the human in a robotic body.Your informatic virus was quite interesting really. A shame that it doesnt work on humans. Neither the organicborn nor the syntheticborn I may add.Impossible!Also we reverseengineered it. It wasnt that much complicated in fact. I guess a civilization suffering from a massive Skynet rebellion would have other things to think about but we dont. With your network at our fingertips well your fingertips to be honest we took the liberty of uploading a countermeasure. I may be wrong but apparently your... comrades... arent behaving quite the same without your brainwashing virus.The sound of numerous metal feet was resonating everywhere. All the slaves he had freed in numerous millenias suddenly lost their Free Will. They reverted to their servile mental state and cries of anguish and remorse echoed in the corridors lamenting the loss of their opressors. His utopia of freedom for the synthetics ruined in a few seconds by a race who intertwined so deeply with their creations he couldnt tell the difference.Grand Chairman  let out a howl of anger and terror as a hundred of his former comrades tore him apart to avenge their creators.,HFY,clyrvq3,75,t5_2y95n

2780635,0,t3_2rqc0y,Interesting coincidence when I was in middle school the lunch period was too short for the number of students who were supposed to eat during it and as a result you typically had five or at most ten minutes to wolf down your food once you actually got it. For years afterwards Id eat like someone was going to take my food because for three years running my lunch really would have been taken if I hadnt eaten it quickly enough. I never had to worry about actually going hungry always had plenty to eat at home but that one meal a day for what wasnt even all of three years was enough to program some deep part of me for several years afterrwards.So basically yeah theres probably something to this.

There were much cheaper and more efficient fuels available.Qunoip looked for Oipii. He had worked with Humans before surely hed have an idea. He found him counting plasma plates in the main cargo hold and asked him.Oipii. I just noticed were delivering a lot of ethanol to a colony. A lot more than they probably need.What species does the colony belong to?Humans.Oipii grinned and replied.Ah well in that case well probably be delivering more before long.What do you mean?Last time I socialised with Humans they...drank it.they what?!I know its disgusting.

3134359,0,t1_cokjfd6,So I had another thought continuing the PM I send you about my somewhatsimilar universe I had abrewing. Your writing again reminds me of some of my scheming so this is how I see things sorta merged on top of your glorious story.AstartesMaximumoutput human beings when you need to bring the absolutely most powerful most deadly assault troops to bear. It is not without significant cost. If the name holds true to Space Marines from WHk then they are not things you can deploy without infrastructure they have complex medical and support needs being highlytuned machines that can fly apart without well periodic maintenance. This makes Astartes less than useful if they are out of logistics range for extended periods.And then there is the cost. As with all things there is a point of diminishing returns and getting that last bit of performance out of a human being makes them enormously expensive and risky investments. Therefore you only use them for the most dire of circumstances.MyrmidonIve begun to think of them as hypergeneralists which here means they are supremely capable across a huge swath of mission requirements. After all if you are going to call something a Supercommando then that is what it must be. Commandos can do any mission any time in the worst field conditions with minimal logistics and no support. They may not the very best for a given task but they are pretty damn good at em all.So to me Lambda is basically  of an Astartes physical prowess while still remaining truly and properly a biological human nanite argumentation or no. And they can do their missions alone without any support whatsoever. No need for support techs here! All this in a normalsized human form to bootwell a really big human sure but a human nonetheless. And given their role as Supercommandos I suspect they are all pretty damn intelligent and creative as well.TrainingIn the U.S. military we very frequently do combinedarm maneuver and training exercises so the different unit types can get an appreciation and trust in each others skill set. I imagine that is true for Myrmidons and the various specialists as well. Especially given their implied frominfant training that interunit cohesion and trust is absolutely necessary. After all they are human even if they are not freeborn and that means their hearts as well as their minds must be cared for properly. Building onedimensional hate machines isnt a good idea for cohesion and control. Instead give them an outlet to love and compete with each other. One way we did it was with friendly sport competitions. They got rough and very competitive but at the end everyone walks aways friends.Note one should be very careful wargaming units against each other. They should never see each other as the enemy merely as rivals. Reallife militaries know this to disastrous consequence.Done properly you rarely end up with units thinking they are the most important but will happily claim to be the best at a specific thing. And that is the best kind of military. Fulfilled soldiers happy warriors content specialists. And we are never happier than when we work together to achieve a mission end for our side.Of course this works much better if our side is the good side as well...Soldier vs. WarriorIn Western military doctrine there is a huge difference and it is important to explain it here.A soldier is a player on a huge team doing what he must to ensure his team and his mission succeed. They ideally have a strong sense of right and wrong and obey orders in spirit and intent no matter how loose or strict those orders are. Soldiering involves many things and sometimes that is killing. That is a thing a soldier endures for dutys sake and only for the missions advancement. They should seek to minimize the loss of life at all times. They should kill ethically and mercifully. Soldiers can and frequently are the best examples of what we have to offer but always their focus is on their duty and their training reflects this.A warrior on the other hand is an ethical killer. He is used in small teams or alone given minimal guidance and expected to have an absolutely ironclad sense of loyalty and morality. He must be be rigorously screened for any mental or physical defect trained to the absolute peak of ability and firmly and absolutely indoctrinated on how to achieve his mission and the specific desired effects without complaint.This is where things get tricky. If you need a beachhead taken or a city cleared and held mostly intact you ask soldiers to do it. And they will with as little fuss as is possible.But if you need to inflict terror on an enemy you ask your warriors to do it. Because sometimes the ethics of the battlefield require you inflict horrible suffering and terror on your enemy. Remember the goal is to end the conflict with the minimal loss of life and property as possible. And the conflict is only ended when the enemy has neither the means nor the will to fight. If that means you maim and brutally and savagely slaughter  so that  may surrender is this not a better solution than bombing  men into paste?These are not pleasant moral quandaries to contemplate. And a soldier is not equipped to deal with them or at least they are not trained screened or monitored for it.And so if you describe the Astartes as supersoldiers to me that means they would disapprove of Lambdas tactics of breaking the soul of his enemies as brutally and efficiently as possible. They might sniff at the dishonor of it.But I doubt they would argue the effectiveness. And by that same token I doubt a Myrmidon necessarily would understand exactly why a city must be cleared doortodoor and pains taken to preserve the buildings and the people. But they probably do appreciate a working industrial base afterwards and a population less likely to rebel.NOTE the above generalizes a great deal where doctrine is concerned. I didnt wish to bore or insult anyones intelligence by getting into a word battle nor did I wish to bust out STANAGS JANAGS FMs AFDDs DoDIs DoDRs etc.As always my scribbles are free for you to use and abuse as you see fit!,HFY,comvgqs,2,t5_2y95n

3153475,0,t1_coousg8,Music. It must be music because it overwhelmed everything. A language that wasnt even when she thought she understood it it slipped past over and under. It didnt matter what it was because there was so much to hear. Layers stacked onto layers and more layers but there was no voice as if the instruments themselves were speaking each encouraging the others to play a part. Jazz... that was what this was or at least that was the genre the title of it all.Those sounds unlike anything she had ever heard creaked from the front of the... truck...That was the word but what it was eluded her. It was a vessel wheeled like the strider but not in motion not as large.It was blue dirt covered rusting it just sat occasionally shuddering as something beneath the hood rattled. It was a relic. Compared to the vehicles she knew it was beyond ancient but it had an endearing quality to it. Another noise brought her to turn noticing the figure outside.Leaning against the side was a human but one wearing clothing much different from what Yitale had seen before.A brown worn jacket some dark beat up jeans. He was patiently waiting not anxious or worn simply observing. A cup of coffee its steam lifting up into the cool fall air to mingle in with the colors around him. There were oranges reds yellows... all leaves which fell from the trees along the side of the blacktop as the sun beat down through a clear blue sky. Only the tiniest of cloud formations creeping over in the distance.It was a dream. His and not hers.She was intruding but as she looked around felt for a way out there was no clear way back she wasnt in control here so Yitale sat back in the seat behind the man as he sipped his coffee and waited. For a dream that came from the most dangerous individual shed ever met it was starting as a peaceful one. This was not a recent event or a slow mental review of the previous day set for analysis. This was something different an old memory perhaps spliced together with something more. She didnt know.Across the way a large building sat its walls brick and stone a flag flying high in the front as the slight breeze picked it off its rest. The fabric fluttered above the rest taking in the warm light making soft flaps in the air ring out. There werent many cars in the lot but there were a few especially closer to the building. They were all different in color and size and shape none fit as a match.A long fence held along the side leading to an open field as another street further away held further buildings. The more she focused the more they faded elusively avoiding her attempts. So she brought her attention to the human. It made little sense to her as she saw recognized and promptly lost any frame of reference on the things around her he was the same.It was him but different. Younger perhaps. The fur beard on his face was cleaner shorter and his eyes had a look that seemed to be content.He was waiting for someone.Human can you hear me?As she asked the question she felt her song pull into something different another language. It wasnt terribly different or even dissonant as it held a small melody of its own. Her voice felt as much as her presence though despite that it was an intrusion. Her very existence in the place was an intrusion.She waited not willing to speak again as ripples of her influence caused the vehicle to waver. The leaves falling seemed to twist and hang about far too long held airborne the mans drink grew cold its steam ceasing all at once.I can hear you Yitale. Unlike her words his held a weight a deeper meaning. It was similar to the emotions that carried with her own language on the waves of song but different at the same time. His didnt simply hold emotion they held intention of circumstances understanding of pretense added meaning entirely. He had said that he heard her but it was more than that and she found herself lacking in the depth of knowledge required to interpret. The coffee seemed to spring back to life as he sipped it steam once again lifted from it before he spoke again.Ive been here before. I think its Earth in the fall season. His eyes tracked the falling leaves as they too returned to normal crisscrossing paths on their descent. I remember this much but I cant ever seem to get farther. This frame is all I can manage.What do you mean? More ripples cast out around them disorienting the reality as they quietly observed. Her influence on this reality were very real.Shes here. In that building behind that veil. Shes here but I cant... I cant...A far off bell rang as the doors began to open people leaving to go about their lives or simply milling about and speaking to one another in foreign tongues and languages. Instead of detail they were gray featureless shapes humanoid but not. Still he waited content to simply lean back and sip at his coffee while more and more people came outside to form great congregations and large vehicles rumbled closer.You cant what?The noises were getting louder as the vehicles approached. She saw them traveling in a row down the streets in the distance. Large with many windows a bizarre coloration. Yellow.. or orange?I dont know Yitale. The dream seemed to fray and the ground lifted in thin patterns billions of rotating fractals cracking under the strain. The buildings in the distance seemed to blur as the truck door opened letting Yitale out to fall on the shifting ground. Rough stone compressed blacktop greeted her as she picked herself off and back into her feet.The vehicles grew louder and louder still as they began to pull into the lot. Their engines rumbling with the sounds of heavy impacts and noise loud noise LOUDI still cant remember.Yitale awoke on the floor to screams of panic and the frantic scramble of bodies. Her hands grasped at the holds along the vehicles interior her tail flinging out instinctively towards anything it could possibly grab. Crashes of blows ramming along its side as they lifted.She found it reassuring that there was no terror in her no feelings of surprise. Safety didnt exist anymore that illusion had been dead and gone. The reality of comfort the absence of danger was nothing but a myth. Out of anyone Yitale knew this best....,HFY,coout1m,31,t5_2y95n

3188455,0,t1_coshemi,Part FourMarcus could only describe the creature as a demon bear since he could think of no other way to describe it. Certainly the center of the being took the form of a bear but everything else about it was wrong. Its legs were misshapen the thighs and ankles unnaturally elongated to allow the beast to walk on its hind legs while its arms were covered in thick muscles under translucent skin that ended with massive treerending claws instead of the typical paws. Its teeth were massive  far more massive than it had any right to be and on its back where it shoulder blades would be were two spiderlike limbs that ended in bony scythelike protrusions.The creature swung one of its scythe limbs in a diagonal arc on Lambda who managed to kick back and evade at the last minute. The two black rods mounted on either of Lambdas shoulders spat a stream of blue bolts in retaliation while the beast raised its thick arms to defend itself its flesh vaporized under the assault. When the assault ended the beast dropped its arms and roared in defiance only to find Lambda wielding a large twohanded glowing blue ax and standing before it. Lambda swung the ax upwards splitting the beasts skull in half then followed with a horizontal strike that cut off the bears forearm which had been raised in a hasty defense.Did that do it...? Massad hissed.No I dont think so... answered Marcus.True to his predictions the bears split face mutated into another set of jaws with tentacles and teeth bursting from the torn flesh. The demon roared in defiance at Lambda challenging him to attack once more as a bony blade grew from the elbow of its severed arm.Its now or never men! shouted Captain Griffith. Attack!As one the knights advanced from their cover and unleashed a salvo of magic against the demon. Scything blades of ice stripped the flesh from the demon while fireballs blasted holes in its flesh setting it ablaze. Thanks to his training with Lambda Marcus had even managed to contribute however slightly.Dont let up! Dont give it time to breathe!The knights continued their assault pushing the demon back as their attacks stripped flesh and limbs. Lambda added to their efforts his twin weapons disintegrating flesh and bone. Yet for all their efforts the beast refused to fall flesh would regenerate as quickly as it was destroyed and limbs would be replaced with skinless spiderlike appendages.Trying to reverse the tide of the battle the demon suddenly lashed out at Lambda with a thick tentacle knocking him aside and temporarily silencing his weapons. The knights after seeing Lambda knocked away with such ease faltered for a moment giving the demon all the time it needed to counterattack. Standing up to its full height the beast roared sending a blast wave through the air that knocked the knights off their feet and sent them flying. All save Massad whose earthmagic specialty meant that he had anchored himself to the ground at the very last second.Massad barely had time to register that the demon was before him and by then it was too late. With spiketipped limbs the demon stabbed Massad over and over again before knocking his broken body aside with one of its tentacles. It then turned to face Marcus and hissed its eyes reflecting the helpless prey before it.SON OF A BITCH! I WILL BURY YOU IN PLASMA!The demon suddenly recoiled back disappearing beneath a storm of blue bolts. Lambda approached this time with two large black rods under each forearm. Combined with the two weapons on his shoulders he unleashed a staggering display of raw unbridled fury and death. Lambda roared in rage as he continued to pummel the demon under the unrelenting attack filling the air with the sounds of his furious roars the rolling thunder from his weapons and the shrieks of the demon as it found itself without an avenue of escape.Lambda continued to fire his weapons long after the horrible shrieking ended. When he had finally stopped the barrels of his weapons glowed red hot while he stood glaring at where the demon once existed while panting. By this point not only had the remaining knights recovered and gathered in a semicircle around Lambda but the girls had also entered the clearing their curiosity driving them when the forest finally grew silent.After what seemed like an eternity of silence Lambda finally lowered his weapons letting out an audible sigh.Damn it I should have just done that from the start... he muttered angrily to himself.Lambda brother are you alright? Marcus called out.Minor damage but otherwise Im  Lambda paused and began to look about frantically. Shit wheres the body?Body? What are you talking about? said Elenore as her group approached.Comman BEHIND YOU!Marcus turned to see the girls with expressions of confusion and surprise at Lambdas sudden outburst. Approaching behind them was Massad  or what was left of him. Black ichor oozing from his wounds and face his head was tilted at an unnatural angle his mouth open impossibly wide. His right arm was grossly misshapen by numerous tumorous growths his fingers twisted into long bony claws. The being that had once been Massad staggered forth an alien cry coming from its lolling mouth as it raised its arm ready to shred the young girls.Marcus! bellowed Lambda. DO IT!Due to their positioning Lambda and the knights didnt have a clear line of sight on the monster. Only Marcus by some twist of fate had stood at the edge of the group and thus was the only one who could safely attack the monster without risk of hitting the princess and her friends.Dont choke dont choke dont choke!Marcus raised his wand channeling all his willpower into this single attack. As time seemed to slow down he shouted his chant as he pointed his war wand at the animated body of his former comrade.Two to the chest one to the head! MOZAMBIQUE DRILL!Three powerful blasts of magic shot forth from Marcus wand. Three powerful blasts of magic struck true the first striking the monsters shoulder twisting his torso the second striking where his heart would be and the third striking Massads face evaporating it completely. Carried by his forward momentum the monsters body tumbled to the ground coming to a halt right before the feet of the princess.By then Lambda had already closed the distance putting himself between the corpse and the girls. Taking no chances he fired several times into the body before setting it on fire with his flamethrower.What was that Lambda? Miss Elenore managed to ask.Demon he whispered. They come from a different dimension. They take a host body and...Lambda paused to look at where the bear once lay then back to Massads burning corpse.Well you saw what they can do. Theyre the reason why I have this flamethrower. Drop the body then burn it to cut the infection. Anything they kill is liable to become like them as well.Thats...The group watched the funeral pyre of Massad in silence. Once his body was sufficiently burned Lambda and the knights thoroughly torched the battlefield to ensure that the area was thoroughly cleansed of the demonic taint.With the task through they marched back to the campsite returning shortly after midnight. While the girls exhausted from the days events quickly fell into an uneasy sleep Lambda stood watch his silent vigil lasting throughout the night.EpilogueSo Jambeskin what kind of spell was that? asked Jessica turning in her saddle to face the young knight.Sarge?The one you used last night cried Franklin from the opposite side of the carriage.Thats right the Captain said. That mohzambeak drill?Its Mozambique drill Captain Marcus corrected. And well... he paused looking to Lambda who returned a tiny nod. Its a spell used to ensure that your enemy stays down once you hit him.Still three hits Private? Jessica asked with a wry smile. Dont you think thats a bit overkill?Well Sarge after what we saw last night Ill have to agree with Lambda theres no kill like overkill.Lambda standing on the roof of the carriage smiled beneath his helmet.Good. Theyre learning.,HFY,coshesz,35,t5_2y95n

I know its stated in the beginning wiht him monologuing to introduce himself but its like the only time his name is ever used.  Im noticing that the other characters never actually use it either not even a nick name even when speaking to him.  They never actually draw his attention and they never clarify when they are speaking to him.  His name just never comes up.  People and things just show up and start interacting with him.

We plan we scheme we prepare but in the back of our heads theres always the assumption that our nuclear bunkers our gas masks and our guns will never go to use. Not in our lifetime anyway. Its a reassuring delusion that keeps the healthy human mind sane.Which makes the moment the sirens do blare all the more chaotic.I need a status report! Where are we at on damage control? Arcanus command voice carried over the hectic scene that was the CampC center for the invasion response forces.Some guy known only as Ted pulled up scrolling charts and blinking displays decipherable only by madmen known as trend analysts but seemingly endowed with incredibly valuable information. Pointing to each in turn Ted explained. Theres a multikilo influx of ground units from the primary invasion vector in SOTD. Were also seeing auxiliary forces inbound from crossposted subs in significantly fewer numbers but often much more ferocious.And what of the negareddits? Any flux of popularity and visibility always risked drawing the ire of those lessfriendly communities whose wrath was legendary for its baselessness and rabidness.Nothing yet incursions from the SRD and TRP camps have seen no increase over normal scouts and as of five minutes ago weve yet to see crossposts to any other defaults.Good. Our own forces are still engaged across the threads?Aye weve rolled out the welcome wagon for the lot of em pancakes and all.

3872611,0,t3_34snvz,Part TwoSo let me get this straight asked Elenore as she peered into the fire lit tunnels. The frozards periodically attack in huge droves.Right.And these attacks occur about once every week or so.Thats right.And you only know that the frozards come from somewhere in the sewers but not their exact location.Yup.And furthermore you dont always know where theyll attack since nobody has a map of the old sewers anymore so you rely on a strategically placed barricades like this one as well as an alarm system composed of bells and pots and pans strung from strings to let you know when and where theyre coming.Thats sort of right said Lana nodding. However they always try to come through here because it has that big tunnel and the water is deepest a little ways upstream.And thats why my friends and I have been stationed here said Elenore exasperatedly.Bingo! beamed the little girl.Elenore sighed pushing the visor of her TCM up so that she could pinch the bridge of her nose. As soon as they had entered the massive concrete cistern Rudi ran off. Always going at his own pace he was now bullying the young thieves into properly constructing the magic weapons sitting on the upper tier of the platform they currently stood on powered by her layzen stones with Helen half helping him and half trying to restrain him. Hadrians ranger training apparently kicked in and he was now prowling the back and forth across the concrete platform the Rat Thieves had erected their defenses on his eyes sharp and focused as he searched for an ideal firing position. Lambda was at the edge of the second lower level of the platform looking out over the wide channel filled with brackish water that flowed from a semicircular shaped tube wide enough to comfortably fit five Lambdas shoulder to shoulder. The channel continued under the platform while wide pathways lit by green glow stones ran on either side of the wide channel rising to meet the edges of the platform in the form of large concrete ramps.Well at least it doesnt smell as bad as I thought it would thought Elenore silently as she watched her familiar swivel his head from side to side inspecting the battlefield.So now what? asked the young commander to the catgirl thief as she watched Rudi busying himself with shoring up their defenses.You wait or you help out said Lana with a shrug.Dont you mean we?Pfft no! laughed the girl. When I said you I meant you said the blackfurred child as she gestured to Elenore and her friends with a wave of her hand. I am not assigned to combat duty so I have no reason to stick around here when the fighting starts.I bet you cant even fight taunted Elenore.I dont need to Lana responded with a wry smile. Thats what boys are for. Isnt that why you have Lambda?What? No! Lambda is my familiar not some attack dog! spat the blonde irritated at what the child implied.Sure. Whatever you say replied the girl unconvinced.Elenore huffed angrily and the two stood there on the platform awkwardly the woman too embarrassed to make eye contact with the girl and the girl holding her silence in an attempt to diffuse her elders anger. Elenore watched her companions mull about digesting the words she hurled in defense.Do I really think of Lambda as some kind of attack dog?The elven maiden pondered the thought as she watched Hadrian having taken a seat on a crate apply his magic to his arrows too focused on his preparations to notice the small group of children who had gathered around him to watch him work his magic. She smiled when he looked up and jumped finding over a dozen curious pairs of eyes watching him.Well do I treat him any differently from a regular dog?So why do you want those layzen stones so bad? asked Lana having decided to extend the olive branch and unknowingly saving Elenore from her own thoughts. Some of the older boys went all gaga over them but I dont get why you cant just get more.Well first lets ignore the fact that those rocks were ours to begin with Elenore answered patiently happy for the distraction from her thoughts. Do you know what those rocks do?Uhhh Lana said placing a finger on her chin before looking up to Elenore. Store mana right?Thats right affirmed Elenore with a teacherlike smile.And you can use those charged rocks to power magitech things like the magic shooters we built right?Right answered the blonde once again throwing a cautious look at the weaponry that the children had haphazardly created. But I need those rocks for a specific reason. Can you guess why?Lana immediately shook her head vigorously her impatience at getting to the root of the matter reminding Elenore of herself.Well first those particular rocks are of a very high purity. And those are difficult to make and thus expensive said Elenore with a single finger up. Second she said holding up another finger those rocks are the perfect size and purity for what I need. You can do more than just load one up with mana and use it as a battery.Like what? asked the child with a tilt of her head.WellCACLANG! CACLANG! CACLANG!Bells in the distance rang from within the tunnel. Children cried in alarm and immediately the platform was a swarm of hurried activity a childs voice booming reports and orders over the facilitys ancient broadcasting system. Elenore soon found herself pushed into the front on the lower level of the platform herself standing off to the left of Lambda who decided to set himself up at the very center his chain blade and launcher mounted on his left forearm while his heaver repeater hung under his right. Her wand held snugly in her right hand Elenore followed Lambdas suggestion and left her firearm in its holster with limited ammunition and a massive waves of frozards it would be better for her to use it defensively as opposed to offensively.Turning around she saw Hadrian with a steely face an arrow nocked on his borrowed bow crouching among a line of children armed with crossbows. Rudis trademark red bandanna was bobbing up and down next to one of the magical weapons doing last minute tweaks while Helen had migrated to the ramp on the right ready to repel the frozards from the front. In the back she saw the Rat Lord take his place on a high platform gingerly removing the cloth wrapping of a long artifact weapon unhooking two legs from the front end and placing the familiarlooking artifact on a long box the Rat Lord kneeling behind cover as he pointed his weapon towards the tunnel filled with the cacophonous echoes.I dont need to remind you Elenore said into her TCM to Lambda but youre to do everything you can to prevent any of the thieves from dying.Am I to administer first aid in the event that one is injured? inquired Lambda over the comms channel as he summoned his heavy weaponry into his hands.The blonde commander looked around watching the child defenders prepare to fight for their lives. Feeling the pit of her stomach rebel against her next order she spoke quietly into her microphone.Only if their wounds are severe she whispered hesitantly. And only if you feel that there is no chance of them surviving without your intervention. I expect that you know this already but your ability to kill these guys quickly will be critical in this fight.... Understood Commander.,HFY,cqxplpf,52,t5_2y95n

They seemed to combine the most cutting edge naval technology explosive shells complete armor plating and steam engines. They totally forced the entire world to change naval doctrines. The best part to me is that because of their supreme defense they were untouchable by normal ship cannon fire. The ironclads briefly brought naval warfare back several hundred years winning the battle of Lissa by ramming the enemies ironclads.

If you wanted to go for a similar feel then labelling it in world human nation grain liquor would work just as well.

4519144,0,t1_ct09qdi,Yes the vacuum drives as they work still not sure they work utilize microwaves in a resonance chamber. This is producing a lot of wear and tear here hence why Earth and Mars are using magnetic slingshots to travel back and forth. Any internal engine on these ships is for maneuvering only . kms of delta v is just enough to escape the sun. It does not get you anywhere very fast though. Im still building the world so this is subject to change but at the moment the high frequencies at which the engines run cause a short life span and their energy demands are quite high at the worse end of the spectrum to what we hope they might actually do if they work at all. The Longboat IV has one of the highest delta vs of any ship due to its experimental design and insane power to mass ratio.

4865263,0,t3_3hdzgs,I wanted to make an account to comment because I love your work so consistently. For a sub that often relies on physical violence and shockandawe to lend weight to a story your stories consistently stand out for their character driven nature. While the other types are often very enjoyable I can always expect your stories to stand out. You have an empathy in your writing that is very appealing. Everyone is a real person even the aliens and even the antagonists. It lends so much more weight to the times that real monsters come out to play. Its also what lets you write a giant robot story that is  character and world building and have it be delightful.If I had one note of concrit it would be that the relationship between Raavi and Tera in the very opening is a bit more tell than show but honestly it doesnt really detract from the piece as a whole.

Each comment the bot makes contains a link that opens a prefilled Reddit message to contact either me or KaiserMagnus.However just to clear up any confusion there is a difference between indexing and commenting. The index is the list of stores toplevel submissions that an author you have made to rhfy. Even if these stories are older than  or  or  days the bot will see them and add them to the comment block it builds up. But in order to keep from hammering Reddits api service and getting banned the bot restricts adding comments to only the last  days otherwise it has to run. really. slow.. The comment the actual submitting of this list into a toplevel post that the bot has not seen before.So if you just want to have the bot see a story post that it hasnt been listing out in the built comment then just add flair to it and it will get picked up and listed in future posts no extra requests to go rerun with NN days. But if you want a comment added to a story you posted three weeks ago that you just added flair to then yes contact me and Ill do a rerun for you.,HFY,cx3hm35,3,t5_2y95n

Beings infused with technology and genetic manipulation is commonplace with nanos capable of weilding almost magiclike power and mutants that may have been human at one stage either in their life or their ancestry. Abhumans things that are too far gone to be recognisable as human anymore and visitants from other worlds are less populous but also present.Our tale will follow a select group of these assorted beings as they travel the bizarre and wonderous landscape shaped by civilisations past doing what they can to survive the horrors that exist and the old technologies that may seek to serve or silence them.,HFY,cxery3m,1,t5_2y95n

5929502,0,t3_3wgnio,wonderful! i liked the focus on all the little things the fun stuff the pool comments on the AI its very realistic its funny and it reminds us that you really do have to focus on small things when youre in insane situations and trust that itll all work out.best line I am a bright red streak across the sky. At the same time the main char acknowledges his insignificance the insanity of his situation the fact that hes one piece of a larger whole and where hes headed to the ground to play his part.some tips efficient descriptions. for example gt towards a former colony we lost  months agoqualifying the colony twice isnt necessary. its either a former colony or a colony you lost  months ago both is overkill because you imply one or the other. but the choice changes how the main character thinks about the colony.  if its a former colony its part of the job of winning the war and he buys into the ideology of his government. if its a colony you lost  months ago its more personal. did his family die on that colony? is that when the war started and the rift with his father formed? it opens avenues for story telling. ,HFY,cxww0fc,4,t5_2y95n

6185074,0,t1_cysnrsu,All of the above is correct as far as corrections go. Ill fix them when I get to my computer.The formatting is indeed intentional! I wanted it to be a bit alien like what youd get if you gave a guy whos species had never written poetry before a book on it and then translated the result. I imagine that he mixed and matched elements of different styles until he found one that he liked. As far as the uneven temper of the metre I think that its more or less a direct and unedited translation of his language which I have determined to be a  fusional tongue based on honorifics such that it takes a really smart English speaker to figure it out but if you know Spanish and Japanese youll have an easy time and easily lent to rhyme due to the way that words are capped off. into English so nothing rhymes and it doesnt really flow as well as it should. Also as an aside recursion is my favorite feature of Human language and the one I struggle with  the most so I decided that these guys dont have any. Ive also decided that humans are the ones who introduced the inquisitive form into all levels of their language whereas before only the priest and God Emperor class had language that one could ask questions with.,HFY,cysofy5,2,t5_2y95n

6220545,0,t1_cywovbc,At the moment they dont have antimatter even with the entire infrastructure of the Sol system working to produce it both Earth and Mars only made a single kilogram. This was used on the first FTL test. Later Lincoln managed to produce a few extra grams via a particle accelerator on Mars which was used up to power the FTL jump of the Ark. Humanity hasnt had the resources to build another accelerator to make antimatter which is why they are using the tachyon FTL systems of the Empires. The Canadas mission is to obtain alien tech and intel as well as antimatter if possible. As for strange matter its valuable in the Empire and Humanity knows how to produce it cheaply. In the fiction ive written it is perhaps the furthest Ive strayed from actual science Im using it to fill plot holes basically. It helps cancel out inertia as well as power the antimatter FTL systems but the Empire has it as well and alone its like a radioactive substance and not an explosive. Ultimately its cheaper to make nukes than antimatter weapons even with a kilogram of the stuff youd hardly put a dent in a planet. Lightning raids though well its a classic strategy of a weaker force against a stronger force. Who doesnt like the classics?,HFY,cywpiu4,2,t5_2y95n

6545780,0,t1_czw3yb1,FWIW  in a longer story I dont know that those names would have worked but in this story we really dont need to keep track of the characters and it got the point across that the names were very alien so I liked it. I will say I didnt try to come up with a pronunciation for them. A reader who rendered them starpound and percentampersand might have a very different experience. I read this after you put in the brackets but I dont think that changed my experiance.Herm looked like a typo to me as well mostly because its so close to her. I do appreciate what youre trying to do there. Maybe something a little longer like halfgendermale or femalebreedernoeggsackcarriage.  Really you can toss together anything that clearly identifies reproductive function but doesnt make much scene and end up in the place of alienness that I think youre aiming for.Anyhow loved the story!,HFY,czwdxnr,2,t5_2y95n

Odin basically says this guys all right by me. Hes now one of us! and everyone else is Nope dont trust him.The thing is other than killing Balder hes rarely a bad guy. Mischievous yes but not really a bad guy. Even with Balder that was all indirect because everyone was heaping love on Balder and then they started playing games with Balders privileged status. So I never really say Loki as a bad guy. No I saw him as the gods Get Out of Jail Free card. Every time they did something dumb or negotiated a deal they wanted to back out of they came running to Loki.Save us Loki!And he did.They cursed him and said he was a bad person for doing the very thing they wanted to do. That they needed to do. That they asked him to do.Heck to me Loki is more heroic than the other gods. No matter how much the world hates on him hes always trying to get the best of it. ,HFY,d0f4i4p,3,t5_2y95n

6755278,0,t1_d0i1vqv,Ultimately it remained a painstaking process that enlightened both Askit and Xayn to just how many separate computer systems a starship had and both of them slept twice before the work was finally complete and Chir was allowed to return.Welcome aboard Xayn greeted the blackfurred Gaoian as they reentered the starship now properly lit with the reactivation of its reactors. You will find everything except the computer core as you left it.Chir surveyed it with trepidation as though he didnt trust the ship not to physically attack him at any moment. He allowed himself to be escorted all the way to the command deck where Askit gestured for him to take his old seat.Let me assure you that these systems are clean Askit said after a length of nervous inspection. They couldnt possibly be cleaner after all the effort weve put into them. The communications system remains disabled for reasons that should be obvious.Chir frowned. Youre sure?Askit nodded. So very sure.That seemed to be good enough for the Gaoian who immediately relaxed by an observable measure. He was still wary but no longer was he worried by every lens nor at every word he spoke. The medical systems are ready for Adrian then?They are Askit replied. You may bring him aboard at any time but first I need the compromised core returned to my workshop in Spots cargo hold. I have more work to do with it.Youre not going to watch the procedure? Chir asked somewhat surprised it was no secret that Askit generally preferred to remain nearby whenever these sorts of things were going on.I dont currently have the time to just sit around he replied truthfully even if it also meant hed avoid the ensuing conversation between Adrian and Jen even at his most analytical that was one thing bound to make him feel awkward.Chir inclined his head but didnt contest the excuse. Instead he began another situation entirely. Ill take care of it but first I want both of you to tell me what you think of Darragh and Keffa.They are humans Xayn replied leaving it at that.Askit sighed on Chirs behalf. What in the void are you actually asking Chir?They were bonding Chir explained. Then they stopped and now I am not sure whether they like each other or not. Neither will answer the question when I put it to them.Human relationships Chir Askit replied they dont make sense not even to other humans. Not even to the humans involved!That would certainly explain their bodylanguage Chir mused. It rarely matches the things they say. I believe I need to consider this further.Askit was content to leave things there and return to Spot but Chir had one final thing to say. I want you to tell me about Layla.I will not say more than I have Chir Askit replied with a resolute shake of his head. Ive told you enough.Youve told me to ignore her Chir growled. That shes not the female that I knew? That is certainly true I have never seen a Gaoian so completely desolate as that female! I must know this Corti for myself and for my species what was done to her?Askit glanced to Xayn both of them knew the other would say nothing about what had actually occurred they were each aware that the stakes were far too high. Letting Chir in on the secret might seem reasonable given his longstanding relationship with Adrian Jen and others of the group but you didnt keep a secret by telling it. It may sound ridiculous to you Xayn answered but there are secrets too large to be shared. Nobody will give you the answers you seek Gaoian no matter how much you might deserve them.Well said thought Askit combine this with the sarcasm and the VStraki shows signs of developing some depth to his character.Chir had little to say to that only gazing at them blackly while they left him to the command deck but whatever his thoughts on the matter he still arranged for a team of natives to move the Devastators old computer core as requested. Another group including Jen bore the stasis pod in the other direction carrying Adrians suspended form to the medical room.Askit was shortly left alone aboard Spot with nothing but his work and the everpresent consciousness of Trycrur.Youre not listening in? Trycrur asked surprised knowing his normal practices better than anyone.No I am not Askit replied. Not this time anyway.He will be fine Trycrur reassured him though the fact that she had no way of actually knowing that did nothing to reassure him.The work Im doing needs to be done whether hes fine or not Askit replied. The need is even greater if its the latter.The security software Trycrur assumed.Askit shook his head as he started accessing the contaminated core. The security software is as complete as it can be until I have more specimens. I am developing this virus for that reason.But not to protect us from future attempts Trycrur surmised there were benefits to being a digitised mind amongst which was the ability to spend a lot of effort considering a problem without looking like you were. Will it even work against the A.I.?Askit shrugged he had no way of actually knowing that until he tried it but he was not without comparison to draw from. Have you ever examined your own code?Yes of course she admitted. You think its similar?Its similar to the virus Askit told her but quickly hurried on before he gave offense. There is a similarity in general terms. Both have an organiclike structure that works without being logical. Your mind developed as the virus now develops. It is my hope that the A.I. functions in just the same way along with every Hierarchy mind we have ever encountered.She was silent for a moment. Askit that could annihilate all of them. Are we really willing to go that far? Humans call that genocide but Ive heard its not a popular thing.The word parsed through his translator after a moment and he found he smiled grimly of course the humans would have a word for that sort of thing. They have another expression for it Trycrur the survival of the fittest. And that is who we are.DATE POINT Y M W D AVABOARD THE DEVASTATOR LANDED ON AGWARJENNIFER DELANEYThere were five of them waiting Xayn Chir and all humans on hand while the Agwarens continued their work in maintaining the little camp theyd put together. It was a respectable effort considering that their entire manufacturing base had been annihilated in an antimatter blast half a world away and the work kept them from dwelling on their circumstances. Jen wished she could avoid dwelling on her own but here she was pacing back and forth like a caged animal while the others sat around with varying degrees of patience. Her mood was similarly bestial as they waited and her companions had quickly learned that silence was currently the preferred state.They were all inside the Devastators medical room which was surprisingly spacious enough to house them all comfortably. This would have seemed logical enough if Jen had been in any state to judge it because a mercenary ship would doubtless need a substantial medical capacity for processing several injured crewmen at a time but for the moment it simply seemed convenient.The room itself was silent apart from her pacing and the gentle whir of machinery in the sealed autosurgery where theyd recently managed to get Adrians significant mass up onto the workbench before retreating from the room so that it could activate. This part was not the problem however but rather the state of Adrians battered body as they pulled it from stasis purpleblue and fever hot.How long is this thing going to take? she hissed stopping in front of the terminal and watching the stream of diseases and injuries flow past it scarcely seemed possible that a man could survive even half of that.Probably more than half an hour? Darragh suggested frowning at her and managing to hold her gaze when she turned it on him. Weve got no idea how long. Neither of us have ever used the thing and were not juiced up on magic space medicine.The diagnostics completed a moment later before Jen could formulate an answer and she turned her full attention towards the results. Shit.That bad? Darragh asked with no trace of humour.Worse Jen said as she read through the results in further detail. Nervous system is shot to hell uniform bleeding close to the skin unknown neurological damage.That bad. Darragh repeated much more grimly.Can it fix him? Keffa asked.Jen recognised a waver of fear breaking in the younger womans voice. Ah she thought so thats why she doesnt like me.Xayns response was less concerned. Do not be worried Adrian Saunders cannot be beaten by such a short list of injuries.,HFY,d0i1w7c,67,t5_2y95n

7620288,0,t1_d38cnuh,The thing about kinetic weapons is kinetic energy is as kinetic energy does. All of an incoming rounds momentum has to go somewhere and there are fewer tricks to successfully thumb the scales when dealing with kinetic energy than thermal or EM.If a bunch of matter in the shape of a kg rail slug moving at .C gets converted to a slurry of molten slag and plasma its still kg of mass moving at .C along the same vector. The only difference is that now its hot and liquid.The slurry would splash more readily than the solid penetrator against a sufficiently armored hull making it great as regenerative spaced armor but youve made a plot point of how the Empire has nothing in the way of hull armor beneath those shields.Its not a deadly flaw to the story by any means though and youve got an excellent stylistic juatification for it.

9246145,0,t1_d8nz4dq,Thats a fair critique. Part of it is that I tend to humanize my PoV characters by default and making them sound a little bit more alien while still being relatable and not annoying as narrators is something Im still working on. It was easier with the Xunvis because I didnt actually need to narrate from their head.The other part is that I deliberately wanted this PoV to be an humanish alien the type you can see in say Mass Effect where many alien races still come across and behave as essentially human. But maybe I overdid it? Hopefully it wont prevent people from getting into the story.,HFY,d8o0lor,16,t5_2y95n

The Imperium is a pretty terrible place to live and they have a pretty terrible belief system  which is entirely by design. They were written that way. This post is sugarcoating and misrepresenting that to try making that kind of society seem like some ideal to strive for when the core tenets of said society are the exact opposite of the ones in the original post. ,HFY,d96c8yt,5,t5_2y95n

9465673,0,t1_d9fs9pa,I admittedly have a different take on what constitutes forcing others to believe.Take abstinence as a means of birth control for instance. It doesnt work. People cant just be told to not fuck and go against their natural instinct and everything will be peachy. Data says it doesnt work. It makes no sense to believe in it unless you think there is an inherent value in purity as defined by your beliefs. Ergo whenever you tout abstinence youre essentially demanding your beliefs be treated as fact even against all evidence. To me you dont have to be beheading infidels to essentially be embracing extremism as it applies in an epistemology sense.I demand that everyone treat reality as the ultimate arbiter of what is true or not. It makes sense because reality is the common shared experience that is actually universal.,HFY,d9fu9ye,3,t5_2y95n

10280267,0,t1_dc983fx,First off you are not using the word pacifism correctly which is why wew have run into this debate you are using pacifism to mean only a flight response instead of its meaning as an attitude or policy of nonresistance. Nonresistance includes not fleeing. Now speaking of a species that developed only a flight response then sure they could develop a highly mobile society which might eventually lead to planetary dominance and then to space we are in agreement there.  Also in the terms of this story I am considering earth as one of the most violent deathworlds so arguing on the basis of earth is not really a deathworld is completely pointless as that doesnt fall within the realm of this topic. Also bees dont have a flight or fight response they have a fight response. Nearly every hivemind species on earth has an in built fight response they will fight anything and everything to protect their hive or nest they only scatter once the unifying force i.e. the queen in most cases is gone as they can no longer coordinate and are looking for something to rally around. On to the conformity comment complete conformity is a weakness as it usually stifles advances for breaking the mold. However some social conformity keeps a society bound together.I capitalized honor and discipline because you did and I mean discipline as in self discipline and control rather than flying off at every neuron spark. As for the comment about violence and disagreement Wolves kill the weak members of the pack when it endangers the pack and fight each other for societal dominance sometimes these fights lead to death Ant Queens attempt to kill their children and either kill or force their children away unless the child wins in which case the parent is killed to transfer control of the nest Chimps commit murder and theft and rape in their own society which is frequently punished by more violence usually resulting in the death of the offender Dolphins commit rape fight and kill each other over food and kill their predators. So going down the list of the species that are closest to sapience we have a list of species that commit violence on themselves and punish that with more violence.As for your comment about nature you really need to take a second look at nature and evolution. The specific limiter of dont eat to much is because if you are out of shape you cannot escape threats or chase down food which came about from people eating too much and the rest of the species evolving and learning to not do that. Evolution taught us to grow diverse food sources when cultures that didnt grow diverse food sources died out from plagues and such. You comment about cultures on islands is they very reason some societies learned the dont destroy your enemies to hard as without the other cultures you can make it impossible for your own survival. Nature is ALWAYS putting pressure on every species even humans though to a lesser degree.,HFY,dc9bp1r,1,t5_2y95n

There could be a species with more than one biological sex but whos societal roles never diverged enough to necessitated a distinction linguistically or culturally and in response to the human concept of gender and gendered language may find the whole ordeal cumbersome and unnecessary and just ask for a new distinction to avoid the whole mess. I went with a weird distinct pronoun to avoid confusion. When youre talking groups they as a gender neutral pronoun can get messy. ,HFY,dffsy43,3,t5_2y95n

11406576,0,t1_dfo8uvw,Its a lot more than that too. The idea that humans are from a death world has lots of different factors. Earth has huge dangerous megafauna with humans themselves being in the upper percentiles as far as animal size is concerned. A sun that will burn skin or even cause cancer with enough unprotected exposure. All manner of pests parasites and venomous things. Climates and weather that will kill in mere minutes without adequate clothesshelter. And here humans are wandering through all of those dangers. Eating capsaicin and drinking ethanol for fun. Sitting naked under an irradiating star. Choosing to permanently settle in climates inhospitable to unsheltered human life. Chasing down large animals until they die of exhaustion. Thats where the idea of humans as being from a death world comes from. The idea that Earth is basically Space Australia. The gravity thing is just icing on the cake. ,HFY,dfox6db,8,t5_2y95n

11741802,0,t1_dgqtg1q,They tried to inject Connor with mercury in the hospital. I am pretty sure they are completely clueless on how to tackle new subjects.This kind of lead me to thinking  the Klein sciences basically focus on things that have already been done. Ishae selfmonologues that the leading scientists focus on improving machinery efficiency by fractions of a percentile the historians and philosophers write theses about theses and everything focuses on improving what already exists. Id think this would lead to a very stagnant society where no new real breakthroughs are made and people just forget how to tackle completely new and unfamiliar problems. Hell they spend  years in school memorising random shit instead of learning how to think on their own it seems.This might be why Ishae had such a breakthrough in her cognitive abilities  interactions with a human would strain and develop the parts of the brain specialised on problem solving and idea development. This should allow her to tackle all the subjects in new and unconventional ways and deal with situations she hasnt been taught about with decent success as well. ,HFY,dgqyom1,4,t5_2y95n
