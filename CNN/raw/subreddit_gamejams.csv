150639,0,t1_cesrggn,Yeah there are teams or groups that form to work together on a game.  Sometimes people come with their teams already formed but generally teams form at the events.  Team formation can happen a lot of different ways and it really varies greatly from event to event.   Usually people without teams go through a process of forming groups in some way.Last weekend I was at a game jam and we ended up taking someone on our team with no gamedev experience.   He wanted to learn and so he ended up sitting with different people and seeing how they did their jobs to get an idea of how it works.  He also provided a lot of gameplay ideas and gave feedback which was useful.  It worked out well.  I definitely recommend going and joining a team regardless of any concerns. ,gamejams,cevl7ew,1,t5_2u0oh
