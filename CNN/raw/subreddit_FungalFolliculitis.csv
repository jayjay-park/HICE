5158493,0,t3_3lhagf,Hi guys my malassezia problem has been getting worse. I feel like restoring barrier function would be useful but at the same time a lot of moisturisers and creams seem to make it worse. What should I do? Olive oil made my skin really bad since it feeds the malassezia but I also have creams such as Physiogel which does contain some oils and a  mixture of liquid parrafin and white soft paraffin. What should I be using on my skin? I also have protopic but have heard of the cancer horror stories online. This article suggests that it may have an antifungal ability but holding down my immune system seems like a bad idea especially when I need to apply stuff all over my body,FungalFolliculitis,cv7sgpy,1,t5_39qcd
