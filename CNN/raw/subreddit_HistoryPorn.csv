68404,0,t1_cem6xoz,Sweden isnt to be condemned merely for the policy decision of remaining neutral any more than Switzerland is. If Germany had attacked them anyway for whatever reason its a sure bet the Swedes would have fought tooth and nail. They may have been neutral but theyve never been passive. And I seem to remember they were much more heavily armed than Norway or Denmark not to mention the armaments industry which presumably is why Hitler decided not to disturb the situation in the first place. It would have required another large occupation force which he couldnt really spare.What Im curious about though is what happened in the week following this photo as Germany was surrendering. Did the embassy staff simply disband and go home? Disband and go find a quiet Swedish lake cabin? Did they surrender themselves to the Allies?

Still one article I read about it said it was the last first in aviation. Everything else someone will ever do in an airplane will need a longer and longer qualifier to distinguish it from something that someone else did already. Tiger Woods was the first really successful black pro golfer. There is nobody now or in the future who could ever join the tour and be as famous as he was from day one. Not even if a woman did it.The first astronauts were well the first. No other astronaut will ever be the first. Sure theyll go farther.

If youre angry about the police not giving a shit about you and your problems or openly abusing you why in the world would you think now that theres sustained civil disorder lets rob blind a bunch of people who have no influence on the way the LAPD acts and just have the audacity to own businesses in the area?Someone else mentioned the  civil unrest in parts of France and the  England riots elsewhere on this page I think with the point of showing how much deadlier the LA riots were.The  riots are a good example of what youre talking about France obviously has a very hitandmiss way of doing things when it comes to immigrants and therefore there are a whole lot of successful ones and then a bunch whore shunted off into the banlieues and forgotten about until some farright scumbag brings up immigrant problems to try and get every immigrant deported.Point is the riots in  in France were almost exclusively targeting the French national police and the gendarme partially because so many of them were brought out on the streets and people like Sarko told them to crack as many heads as possible.Which doesnt mean that there werent people who used what was going on as an excuse to act like assholes or just to smash stuff up but the major thing was this boiling over of rage towards the behaviour of the French police and associated institutions. England  is far different and you could compare it to aspects of the LA riots. You got things that were worthy of protesting including the reason as to why the riots started but then you got a whole bunch of white and black chav culture types running around smashing things and trying to steal whatever they could carry away.In the  riots you see the Koreans and other groups from the LA events replaced with Arabs and Pakistanis and Turks and Poles and Romanians organizing neighbourhood watches and defending their businesses and properties from vandals or looters.,HistoryPorn,cfb6z1b,2,t5_2skqi

325827,0,t1_cfeiqtq,Well I really am not allowed to go into detail. I still rely on my security clearance for a job and Id rather not risk having it revoked. I went through in fall  as part of my aircrew training. Basically its an allout realistic roleplay scenario that lasts a couple days. Its a fullyfunctional POW camp at Fairchild AFB WA. But everything is based on lessons learned from POWs from WW Vietnam and the First Gulf War. Its pretty rough physically. They cant really beat us and torture us exactly like how it was done by the Japanese VC and Iraqis but they do stress our bodies and have techniques for hitting us that hurts and stuns but isnt damaging. It sucks but it was somewhat reminiscent of doing push ups etc. as punishment in basic. You wear a hood and they march you everywhere. They put you inside containers that are just slightly too small for you. Lot of stuff like that. As an  year old it sucked but nothing terrible. The worst was the interrogations. They used everything. Ive had nice friendly Red Cross workers try to glean info from me. Tiny soccer mom looking women who would kick my ass around the room. Huge beefed up angry guy throwing shit around and acting like he would murder me. So on and so on. They wanted us to turn the tables and give false info misdirect change the topic etc. All these techniques. Ill admit I sucked at it. I couldnt do it. I just clammed up and wouldnt say a word so shit would get worse. Eventually I realized what they wanted and just fell back to the shitty examples they taught us in the weeklong classroom work prior. Once I did that they quickly moved me on to the next phases. We were kept in small cells. Not allowed to sleep. No food until they said so. Everyone tried to sneak in stuff. I tried to smuggle power bars and jerky. They found the powerbars but left the jerky after the strip search. Yes. Full strip search with a visual inspection of cavities. Dont ask what they did regarding females I dont know. Before you ask the jerky was hidden inside my jacket sleeve.Terrible music played over the intercoms all the time. I think one was Yoko Ono. Eventually myself and the guy in the cell next to me started dancing best we could cant stand up straight and singing to it. Got some extra punishment for that. Fake news reports of the terrible atrocities the US was committing against the fake country. I was forced to sign a confession about all the babies I killed etc. But if you read the signature youd like Bob Evans was the worst war criminal ever. Later they would try to get us to do war labor pows doing labor for a war effort is illegal under the Geneva Conventions but we would sabotage the shit out of it like some Three Stooges episode but with  people. After it was all done I developed a huge respect for those who had to endure the real thing. As much as I hate him as a politician I have huge fucking respect for John McCain for what he went through.,HistoryPorn,cfejjhl,26,t5_2skqi

344019,0,t3_1y00e5,My homeland is a beautiful mess. In a halfmile radius in the center of Sarajevo you can visit an Orthodox Church a Catholic Cathedral a Muslim Mosque and  Jewish Temple. There have been periods of positive collaboration and times of utter destruction. When times get tough people always blame the other. But even in times of mess and destruction moments of altruistic humanity occur as demonstrated by this picture. I have two stories from the civil war in the s to demonstrate this further. Little background I was  when the war started in . My mother is Orthodox and my father is Muslim. We remained on the Bosnian side during the war. When the war started we moved from one of the bigger cities to the countryside where my father was born because it was safer. Half a mile away was a Serbian village. They remained in their homes for the first year when the war started. Eventually they thought it would be better if they relocated to the Serbian part of the country.  Families moved one by one. One of the last left was an old couple. One day the man simply abandoned his wife and left without her. She was too frail to go on her own. For a year she stayed with my family in our home until we were able to locate her relatives. I would like to think that we did an incredibly humane thing because these were our neighbors our friends our family.The second story my father told me. Big part of the war was handle in the trench warfare style. The soldiers were no more than quarter mile away from each other. One of the Bosnian soldiers daughter had wandered off from a nearby village and was found by the Serbian soldiers. The Serbian soldiers called out the mans name and when he responded they told him they had found his daughter. All firing was put on hold until the daughter could walk over to the side of his father. I hold on to moments like these as a small sign of hope that one day we will be able to reconcile what had happened in the past. ,HistoryPorn,cfgfdjf,60,t5_2skqi

At larger camps that were actually decommissioned as they ran out of Jews to kill large crematoriums were used and the ashes were buried in large pits then the crematorium was disassembled and the pits covered over. At camps the Germans abandoned hastily as the Allies advanced corpses were left where they died. If they had some time but not a lot cruder methods like this were used. The Germans knew theyd be held accountable and they tried to get rid of the evidence as quickly as they could. Hard to hide million plus bodies.,HistoryPorn,cfi3z3m,6,t5_2skqi

In other areas that we have left the homes were sold cheaply and gradually the areas declined. Its a shame. I lived there for  years and loved living in Harsie and really miss it as well as living in Germany.

The report found that scores of political prisoners arrested under Fidel continue to languish in prison and Ral has used draconian laws and sham trials to incarcerate scores more who have dared to exercise their fundamental rights.Freedom House classifies Cuba as being Not Free and notes that Cuba is the only country in the Americas that consistently makes Freedom Houses list of the Worst of the Worst the Worlds Most Repressive Societies for widespread abuses of political rights and civil liberties.A  Human Rights Watch report notes that the Interior Ministry has principal responsibility for monitoring the Cuban population for signs of dissent.

She said evidently it was a thing and a lot of the personnel there were encouraged to send these letters  dunno if it was a n enlisted man endeavor or if the brass came up with the idea. She was afraid it might be radioactive so naturally I hopped on over to askscience just to be on the safe side although I didnt see how it could be. Didnt get much in the way of replies but the general sense of it was er no it is not radioactive.I subsequently discovered though that another relative had been at one of the desert tests and died very young of a brain tumor.,HistoryPorn,che7xpk,49,t5_2skqi

The way to draw BampW and color are so different that flipping them looks awkward. Shading toning visual representation are different that it looks off later. Even by professionals. The same is for when tv shows do that one BampW special episode but where none of the crew and visual workers change any of the wardrobescenerycolors to make the BampW look good. It just comes off looking artificial and forced. Whether something looks good doesnt mean its a good thing to do just because we have the ability to do it. There is a valid artistic integrity for why photographers and artists do a certain thing especially when it comes to dark room production that is easily lost when being colorized on a computer or via hand painting.,HistoryPorn,chl6wjw,3,t5_2skqi

An obvious indicator that MRA groups are just misogynists. They like to whine on about inequality towards women but never address issues that stem from men. Like having to act macho all the time or be seen as weak and outcast a big cotributor to young male suicide even though in modern society there is no need for being macho at all!

Knowing which way his bread was buttered the doctor confirmed Bernays suspicion and wrote to five thousand of his doctors friends asking them to confirm it as well.

1499509,0,t1_cj487dj,Stalin was using his position to progress a radical program of social economic and gender equality the likes of which the world had never seen entirely contrary to tradition and quite contrary to anything like natural law. The guy practically eradicated religion among a population of over  million when counting the satellite states. He engaged in vast projects of collectivism redistributed land killed former land holders moved huge populations of people around a massive country and generally did everything possible to enforce an entirely new social structure the likes of which the world had never seen. The point of the system was to deconstruct hierarchies and boy did Stalin ever deconstruct a lot of hierarchies generally with extreme acts of violence. That you would try and paint this as right wing is an utterly absurd twisting of the entire concept that defines the whole leftright spectrum. You will notice that in the very wikipedia entry not once is Stalin Socialism or Commuism ever mentioned. This is because it is complete nonsense to call any of them right wing as the explicit goal of the Soviet project was left wing progressivism including under Stalin. Here is the section of that same wikipedia article that you apparently neglected to readgtThe meaning of rightwing varies across societies historical epochs and political systems and ideologies. According to The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics in liberal democracies the political Right opposes socialism and social democracy. Rightwing parties include conservatives Christian democrats classical liberals nationalists and on the far Right racists and fascists.gtThere has been considerable criticism of the reduction of politics to a simple leftright axis. Friedrich Hayek suggests that it is incorrect to view the political spectrum as a line with socialists on the left conservatives on the right and liberals in the middle. He places each group at the corner of a triangle.gtEatwell and OSullivan divide the Right into five types reactionary moderate radical extreme and new. Each of these styles of thought are seen as responses to the left including both liberalism and socialism that have arisen since the French Revolution of .gtThe reactionary right looks toward the past and is aristocratic religious and authoritarian.gtThe moderate right is typified by the writings of Edmund Burke. It is tolerant of change provided it is gradual and accepts some aspects of liberalism including the rule of law and capitalism although it sees radical laissezfaire and individualism as harmful to society. Often it promotes nationalism and social welfare policies.gtThe radical right is a term developed after the Second World War to describe groups as different as McCarthyism the John Birch Society Thatcherism the Republikaner Party in West Germany and so on. Eatwell stresses that this use has major typological problems and that the term has also been applied to clearly democratic developments.  It includes rightwing populism and various other subtypes.gtThe extreme right has four traits according to Roger Eatwell antidemocracy  nationalism  racism  the strong state. He adds that violence is now dropped as a characteristic.gtThe New Right consists of the liberal conservatives who stress small government free markets and individual initiative.For further clarity perhaps it would help to read the wikipedia entry on Leftwing politicsgtIn leftright politics leftwing politics are political positions or activities that accept or support social equality often in opposition to social hierarchy and social inequality. It is typically justified on the basis of concern for those in society who are perceived as disadvantaged relative to others and an assumption that there are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished.If you somehow think Stalin was right wing you simply have no understanding of what the term even means. ,HistoryPorn,cj48k7q,-7,t5_2skqi

Most of this that Im talking about applies to the Americans French and British forces. I dont know much about the experiences of the other nations.

After reaching the age of  I have decided not to involve myself any longer with matters that are not concerned with my private life. However I am still the most senior German officer. Many turn to me sometimes with wishes but more often with their concerns. During these weeks our concern is with the spirit of our unique and successful Army. The concern results from the crimes committed in Poland looting and murder that take place before the eyes of our troops who appear unable to put an end to them. An apparent indifference has serious consequences for the morale of our soldiers and it is damaging to the esteem of our Army and our whole nation. I am sure that you are aware of these events and that you certainly condemn them. These lines intend to convey my daily growing concern at the reports that constantly reach me and I have to ask you to take up this matter with the highest authority. The messages I receive are so numerous many come from high ranking persons and from witnesses. As the most senior officer I cannot keep them to myself. In transmitting them to you I fulfil my duty to the Army. The honour of the Army and the esteem in which it is held must not be jeopardised by the actions of hired subhumans and criminals.

1978329,0,t1_ckrk1h6,I am not declaring that Germans are evil.I am not declaring that Germans have ever been inherently evil.I havent reframed anything Ive been making the same point from the beginning.  Im rephrasing because you seem to be hearing something different than what Im saying.Heres other points Im NOT trying to makegtSo I am supposed to believe that the atrocities committed under the Nazi regime are an accurate representation of the average Germans composition Somebody may want you to believe that.  That somebody is not me.gtThat the short period of time during the Nazi regime is the only time in Germanys history that they could let their hair down and freely act on their true nature.Again not related at all to what I am trying to say.gtAnd thats why modern Germans speak so fondly of the Nazi regime since it was the only time they could truly be themselves.We both know they dont speak fondly of the Nazi regime and again NOT MY POINT.gtYour assertion is disingenuous trite and frankly disrespectful. So far I see no evidence that you have any idea what my assertion is.  If I were asserting the things you say I am then my assertion would be disingenuous trite and frankly disrespectful.Let me try again to illustrate my point.  If you still dont understand what Im saying then Im not capable of articulating it or you are drowning in confirmation bias.Please bear with me through some examplesI can imagine that the rich guy going down the street in the Porsche is really just an ordinary guy like me.  If I had lots of money Id probably be driving a comparable car and I can easily imagine myself doing so.  My life is not much like his but I can fathom the major features of his life and how they might affect his outlook or attitudes.  I can imagine that moderately wealthy people everywhere are probably more or less just like me aside from the wealth.Now look at someone like Bill Gates.  The guy has truly unimaginable sums of money despite his charitable works.  In my wildest most decadent dreams I doubt very much that I could spend money as fast as he was making it at some points in his life.  I dont think I could think of things to want buy them get bored with them and then think of more things to want that quickly.  I cant even begin to put myself in his shoes or the shoes of anyone like him.  There are no doubt creative things to do with that kind of money both to your own benefit and to help out your fellow man that I couldnt possibly think of from my perspective.  His money and power certainly impact or have impacted his relationship with every single person he meets and every business interaction and his reunions with classmates from before his self image and all other facets of his life that I can think of.  As a schmoe someone who is happy just to keep my mortgage paid and my family in a reasonable standard of living Bill Gates and I are living in different worlds we have dramatically different viewpoints and are having life experiences that are probably similar only insofar as our biological similarities.Its a pretty fair bet that all Nazis who participated in the Holocaust activities have at least one of these attributes.  Committed whichever atrocity from the Holocaust you woud prefer to choose..  Wanted to do so..  Were compelled to do so.So what the hell does this have to do with Bill Gates?From the moment those members of the military or Nazi party crossed that line where one or more of the three things above applied to them they have ceased to fit into the category of just like me.  They have entered a state of existence that is even less fathomable to me and more impossible to imagine or relate to than is Bill Gates.Were those Nazis  just like me before?  Probably.  Were their descendants just like me? Probably.  Are current Germans just like me  Most likely.But while I can believe that the guy who broke into my car last week is probably just like me underneath it all I can no longer find enough similarities with people who have done what the Nazis did to come within  miles of thinking they were all just like me.BUT what I can do is appreciate the occasional personal story of German soldiers from the period that Ive encountered here or there enough to empathize with and understand and relate to the subject of such a story as someone who could have been just like me  because in such a case I am made privy to details of that persons life which expose the similarities and humanity that existed.  It becomes possible to do so when thinking about an individual as opposed to the faceless mass that committed the Holocaust.Ultimately Im not morally judging the Nazis at all really.  What Im trying to do is explain to you back to your original point why any given person might not be capable of looking at them as just like all the rest of us.gtI can see why youre preparing your exit and trying to reframe the discussion since your argument was essentially dismantled in one post.No its because you either arent hearing my point or you are ignoring it.

2167397,0,t1_cld20be,gtIn Robinson Texas Lucy Fryer was murdered while alone at her house on May  . She and her husband George were English immigrants and had become well respected in the rural community where they operated a farm.gt The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by bluntforce trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington a seventeenyearold black man who had worked on the Fryers farm for five months was responsible one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucys body was discovered. That night sheriffs deputies traveled to Washingtons home finding him in front of the house wearing bloodstained overalls. He attributed the stains to a nosebleed.gt The Hill County Sheriff Fred Long questioned Washington with Fleming Washington told them he had killed Fryer following an argument about her mules and described the murder weapon and its location. Long brought Washington to Dallas Texas while Fleming returned to Robinson. Fleming soon reported that he found a bloody hammer where Washington had indicated.gt As the trial commenced the judge attempted to keep order insisting that the audience remain silent. Jury selection proceeded quickly the defense did not challenge any selections of the prosecution. Bernstein states that the trial had a kangaroocourt atmosphere. The judge asked Washington for a plea and explained the potential sentences. Washington muttered a response possibly Yes interpreted by the court as a guilty plea. The prosecution described the charges and the court heard testimony from law enforcement officers and the doctor who examined Fryers body. The doctor discussed how Fryer died but did not mention rape. The prosecution rested and Washingtons attorney asked him whether he had committed the offense. Washington replied Thats what I done sic and quietly apologized.gt After four minutes of deliberation the jurys foreman announced a guilty verdict and a sentence of death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back biting one man but was soon beaten. A chain was placed around his neck and he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob on the way downtown he was stripped stabbed and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington semiconscious and covered in blood was doused with oil hung from the tree by a chain and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers toes and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain but was unable to owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching including Washingtons bones and links of the chain.gt In  Manfred Berg concluded that Washington probably murdered Fryer but doubted that he raped her. The same year Julie Armstrong of the University of South Florida argued that Washington was probably innocent of both charges. Bernstein notes that Washingtons motives have never been established. ,HistoryPorn,clfbruz,6,t5_2skqi

2215767,0,t1_cllff26,The whole weekend was a bunch of conferences and panels on intellectual topics with a whole array of professional speakers. Its invitation only and Im not sure how we got invited but you register to participate in these panel discussions. My parents registered me in this panel with all these other kids about who your hero is and why. I was easily the youngest in my discussion and all these kids are debating about whether or not fictional super heroes could be heroes and I didnt really know what to do so half way through I just interrupted the debate and gave this little  year olds speech in the microphone about how my dad was my hero. I remember everyone laughing and applauding. I didnt understand at the time but I must have been pretty darn adorable this little kid surrounded by a bunch of  year olds interjecting something that was completely off topic. My older brother who would have been  had to give a speech on what he would say to the president over a bag lunch. I remember it was a huge deal because the actual president was sitting in the audience but the only thing I recall about it is not knowing what a bag lunch was.I wasnt actually on the beach when this picture happened but I shook his hand in the lobby of a hotel nearby. I remember seeing him hanging out by the pool and watching him play golf with my dad and a bunch of other people.The funny thing was even thought I was seven I distinctly remember watching all these grown up men who were likely very successful in their own right acting so fake and groupie like around Clinton. It was like all the kids trying to be cool with the popular guy in middle school. Like everything Clinton said people would laugh a little too much and even as a small child you can recognize that behavior.,HistoryPorn,cllh6pb,5,t5_2skqi

Aside from every single professional scenario you also have less formal places like reddit where a spelling error will nullify your entire argument. Check out rcrappydesign if you want to see what happens when people dont think about how something reads. The only reason to not use proper grammar is laziness. There is no pro to not using it other than it allows you to not learn something. If your whole point is that  as long as your idea is conveyed it doesnt matter how you say it. While that has some basic truth quick conveyance is still inhibited because people need to figure out what you meant. We all get taught the same English. ,HistoryPorn,clrxp9k,4,t5_2skqi

2402205,0,t1_cm80c03,gtThis sniper wasnt necessarily traumatizedWhile your overall point is spoton about how our views on death and even pain have changed radically over time and this is something people very often fail to realize I believe that if the sniper actually saw the childs face he was likely traumatized.  The trauma we experience when we harm or kill another human being is not a psychological phenomenon so much as a physical one.  Mindset does not matter at all.  People who kill in self defense and with every justification in the world get just as traumatized as those who kill when mugging or killing in a genocide or the like.  The effect is reduced if you can not see the persons face and greatly reduced if you only see their back or of course dont see them at all.  Most people presume due to a profound lack of experience with violence in modern society that if they were put in a position where they had to kill someone to protect themselves or their family that they could pull the trigger and feel righteous about it.  They cant.  Unless they are clinically a psychopath they will be severely traumatized.  Dealing with it will be even worse since everyone will argue that they have no reason to be traumatized.  The book On Killing is the only one I know of which deals specifically with the consequences to a killer of performing the act of killing.  It mostly concentrates on soldiers and soldiers do face even greater challenges than civillians in such a situation they are trained so that they often kill a person by reflex where no conscious thought can override their decision to kill.  Thats one of the main purposes of the training they go through.  If they hesitate enough to think about whether to pull the trigger almost none of them ever will. but the root causes are the same.  Humans have recognizing faces hardwired into their brains and have things called mirror neurons which force a crude sort of empathy on people at a fundamental level.  If you see someone running mirror neurons will fire and light up the parts of your brain you would use if you were running for example.  This is not conscious and you cant turn it off not even with training.  The rush of adrenaline and other neurotransmitters involved in intense lifeordeath situations imprint themselves onto your brains very structure.  This is why flashbacks after traumatic events are common and why people who go through trauma often cannot force themselves to stop thinking about it.  I think it is important for people to realize that yes you could become a monster like the Nazis.  And no you can never be as tough as an action movie hero.  PTSD is not something weak people get.  Its part of how the brain works.,HistoryPorn,cm8mdj9,2,t5_2skqi

I kind of doubt it was enough that it would have warmed up that huge amount of water appreciably. If you live in a place where it gets cold in the winter you may have seen workers laying down a layer of straw and tarps over a new sidewalk that they poured when it was near freezing outside. This is to trap the heat generated by the concrete in order to help it set up better. So concrete produces enough heat that its noticeable and even useful on a fairly small scale.The Hoover Dam was big enough that the engineers who built it were kind of into unknown territory when it came to the consequences of trying build something so massive from concrete.  If they hadnt been thoughtful about it its entirely possible that the dam would have crumbled from the stresses caused by uneven heating as the concrete cured.,HistoryPorn,cn3y4vb,5,t5_2skqi

2780357,0,t1_cnjvzdn,I think the reason people jump to say Japan hasnt apologized like Germany has come from the place that German citizens seem to be totally and completely aware of the horrible things they did in the war. German citizens seem sometimes terrified to come off as a racist even in light of things going on in Europe they have one side speaking up and the other side calling them racist for saying anything at all about Muslims. That shows the danger of a people taking to much blame for something grandparents did but the issue with the Japanese is that they dont even really fear racism. There was a video awhile back of a Japanese teacher asking his students if Japan had a problem with racism and nearly all of them said no even though he could cite instances they would know where racism occurred. Its mostly a cultural thing and I think thats what fuels the complaints about the lack of an apology even though its totally baseless to say that.,HistoryPorn,cnk488t,12,t5_2skqi

I have literally seen this when in a crowd of people who came to watch the Queen. The police cordoned off the street so that the public had to stand on the opposite side of the street. Then shortly before she came out a bunch of local governmenties came out and stood on the other side of the street blocking the large crowd who had been waiting a long time. So the entire crowd were yelling Move out of the way over and over.Basically the government types just kept looking back with an expression that was basically Stop making so much noise you are ruining this for me.In the above case hanging might have been going a tiny bit too far but firing the lot of them would have been a great first step. Only at the moment that they were fired might they have understood that people were royally pissed.

Russia was always the target for gaining lebenstraum Hitler outlines that plan in Mein Kampf.He took out France to remove it from the war but was happy letting it have a puppet state under the Vichy government except for key strategic areas the Nazis wanted militarily.

3155829,0,t1_cojgatg,Did a little more digging based on your digging. Looks like he was on Sugar Loaf Hill.ltexcerpt from the extensive historygtgtMortar fire and infiltration steadily cut down the small force until at dawn on  May the position on Sugar Loaf was held by only one officer and nineteen exhausted men. Daylight made the situation even more precarious for now the enemy entrenched on the Horseshoe and on Crescent Hill could put accurate fire on the Americans. Orders arrived from Battalion at  stating that relief was on the way. The marines had already given some ground the enemy was now massing fire on the crest and Japanese infantrymen were creeping up the hill from their caves on the reverse slope. The relief was exceptionally difficult because of the heavy fire. A platoon of Company D th Marines attempting to reach the crest quickly discovered that an effective relief would require an attack against the Japanese who were trying to retake the crest of the hill. The platoon leader st Lt. George Murphy ordered an assault with fixed bayonets. The marines reached the top and immediately became involved in a grenade battle with the enemy. Their supply of  grenades was soon exhausted. Lieutenant Murphy asked his company commander Capt. Howard L. Mabie for permission to withdraw but Captain Mabie ordered him to hold the hill at all costs. By now the whole forward slope of Sugar Loaf was alive with gray eddies of smoke from mortar blasts and Murphy ordered a withdrawal on his own initiative. Covering the men as they pulled back down the slope Murphy was killed by a fragment when he paused to help a wounded marine.,HistoryPorn,cop3la5,2,t5_2skqi

3257193,0,t1_cozhoug,I was at the venue. I went to school there back at that time. The area has a major film studio and we constantly had celebrities in town shooting movies and television projects. Bushemi and Vaughn were in town shooting Domestic Disturbance. Dont remember it? Neither do I.Anyways they and their entourage were out and about and were at the same nightclub as myself and hundreds of other people. I wasnt close to the actual incident when it started but from firsthand accounts Vince Vaughn was recklessly hitting on this guys girlfriend so his companions and he started a verbal altercation with Vaughn and his crowd. This quickly escalated and due to the fact celebrities were involved in the fracas everyone and their sister squeezed in and it became chaos. The venues security ended up ejected essentially everyone because it was madness. As the altercation broke out into the street things got crowded and confusing but one of the gentleman I believe it may have been the man whos girl was being wooed by Vaughn drew a blade and attempted to attack Mr. Swinger. Bushemi was stabbed in an attempt to break up the hostilities. This all took place in perhaps the span of two minutes. The police were on the scene fast and broke up the massive crowd that had formed.,HistoryPorn,cozmaw3,2,t5_2skqi

3319094,0,t1_cp6fs9z,My theory is that some people look back on Reagans presidency fondly because he made people feel that America was a world power again.Besides having a shitty economy the United States lost a lot of prestige during the s.  The Vietnam War the Oil Crisis Watergate the Iranian Revolution and the Hostage Crisis.  These were events that all made Americans lose confidence in not just their government but the status of the United States as a world power as the United States was unable to do much to stop these events from happening.Then Reagan comes in and he tells the rest of the world Americas in charge and theres nothing you can do about it.  The invasion of Grenada bombing of Libya and the overall escalation of the Cold War were the result of Reagan.  And while every president has presided over his fair share of questionable foreign interventions Reagan publicly projected confidence and strength in his actions and the results made it seem like America were winners again.This is a really general summary of why I think some Americans like Reagan.  Public image shouldnt affect the view of a countrys leader but it does.  And itd be great if more world leaders worked to cooperate with other countries but in reality most voters want a leader that puts hisher country far far above every other country.,HistoryPorn,cp6lski,70,t5_2skqi

On a regular basis at protests people were killed or permanently crippled or brain damaged from police or civilians.  Like these guys were literally risking their lives at every protest. I had seen the pictures of the dogs and fire hoses but before reading that book I just thought well thats pretty bad abuse... now I realize that especially earlier in the movement and at less mediacovered events death or permanent crippling injury was possible.Fucking brave men women and children to stand up to that threat especially knowing that if you fight back it will only get worse for you and the movement.,HistoryPorn,cpoe0oa,3,t5_2skqi

Firing over open sights is something that most medium artilery i.e. French  mm British pdr could blow through with ease on a direct hit. Early tanks had very thin armor plating which could be pierced by some smallarms even.  The Germans develiped a mm antitank  TGewehr to deal specifically with Allied tanks later in the war.  As for just rolling over trenches if a tank foundered into a shell hole that was too deep or tried to cross a trench that was too wide it would just pitch right in unable to cross the gap.  This was countered quickly by tanks carrying giant bundles of brush called fascines which have been used since biblical times to help attacking forces bridge a trench or moat during a quick assault.  ,HistoryPorn,cqayfxt,112,t5_2skqi

Just a background he was a private in the war.He went through a literal hell and his war stories are all filled with really dark humour. Such as the various deaths of his comrades most of them werent kill by the enemy but rather got killed by the jungle. He also doesnt do political rants in his story but rather just telling the facts and how things happen.His drawing style of realistic backgrounds on top of the catoonish characters makes it even better. You laugh at the cartoonish main guy himself getting punched by his sgt when he did something stupid .Or laughed at the guy who went fishing but died when a fish jumped into his mouth and killed him from not being able to breath. Then you realized this all happened. Or the lower enlisted cheering when their corporal got killed and went missing.

For the second piece Kowald opted to literally take it to the streets and apparently invited every musician in Wuppertal as well as a number of nonmusicians to participate. So in addition to the regular Globe Unity personnel we have a piece brass band a Greek bouzouki quartet and Wupperspatzen  a piece accordion ensemble. Chaos ensues. Performed and recorded in the town square one has the dizzying impression of wandering through a space where the local bureaucracy made a horrible error and no one wants to budge. So you have a schmaltzy brass band butting heads with free jazzers while sidestepping the advancing accordion army and trying to ignore that raucous Greek clarinet player.

The thing is its not like the rich dont still get private care elsewhere in fact many of the politicians who enforce the publiconly system in Canada travel to the US for their own medical needs.  A mixed system allows for maximum utilization of resources like operating theatres and MRIs.  One of the most common misconceptions is that private care would take resources from the public system.  In Canada doctors literally cannot perform surgeries much of the time because the government wont fund the time in the operating theatre.   ,HistoryPorn,crlkpfc,3,t5_2skqi

After JFKs assassination he stayed on as attorney general under Johson even though the two men hated each other. They still didnt managed to pass the civil rights bill JFK proposed.

But the drinks people were making in that postwar era had little to do with the recipes that were around before Prohibition.Around the turn of the st century was the first time postProhibition that people really looked back to historical resources like Jerry Thomas BarTenders Guide from . The OldFashioned is a good example because the classic is just bourbon or rye bitters sugar and a citrus twist but in the midcentury everyone wanted theirs with soda and muddled oranges and cherries and whatnot.The Martini is interesting too. People drank the hell out of them in the ss but that was when the whole give me cold gin served up while glancing disapprovingly at an unopened bottle of vermouth trend really took off. Historically the first ones date back to the early s they were made with either a  or  ginvermouth ratio which I personally think is a much better drink.None of those midcentury recipes are objectively wrong or bad but they definitely differed from the way they were originally made. Looking back to the classic recipes as well as riding on the coattails of the foodie movement is what really kicked off the cocktail renaissance we see today.,HistoryPorn,csg6lyf,3,t5_2skqi

This was in the late sWell as anyone who has worked odd shifts can tell you the conversations you get up to at AM can cover quite a lot of ground.So over the course of time I learned a lot about Islam that I didnt know learned some little things about life in Iraq etc. He was really one of my favorite guys to be on shift with and was so quietly pious and truly devoted to his religion.  He makes it easy for me to understand the people who say that Islam is a religion of peace  I have rarely known such a gentle person.Anyhow  with all that background  one night he was telling me how he came to live in the US and that he had come in through Chicago and lived there for a period of time.  Now I dont know much about Chicago but my impression was that there would have been a lot more of the kinds of job he was qualified for there than in the particular city and state where we were sitting and having this conversation.  So I asked him why hed left Chicago.It was probably the only time I ever saw him angry as he pounded the table with his fist and said in his super thick accent  TOO MANY FOREIGNERS!!!.I just started laughing and after a few seconds he understood why and started laughing too... ,HistoryPorn,cskm3yd,5,t5_2skqi

4502125,0,t1_csxmsxp,You seem to be making a logical assumption but it is very incorrect. Many companies will put untrue commercials out knowing very well they will be forced to remove them.A good example of this is cell phone companies in America. You will see every one toute stuff like Best Network Largest coverage Fastest internet etc. etc. It is all a bunch of bullshit intangible often unmeasurable claims that surmount to false advertising. There is a circular pattern where they put up a commercial other companies have lawyers send cease amp desists then they stop the commercial. It never goes anywhere. Lawsuits are never filed. The FCC never has a hearing. It is just this self sustaining circle of each company making outlandish claims of being the best before being served to stop then they make the claims slightly different before being served to stop etc. It is so well known and understood that CSRs training for call centers are shown this system and how to react to these commercials being brought up by customers whether it be their companys claims or another companys. Its just more profitable to be amongst the lies and have a higher advertising budget due to commercial churn than it would be to have less new customer acquisitions.Source I went through thus said cell phone call center training and later became a trainer myself spewing this info to rooms of wide eyed newbies who most likely would all quitget fired before ever needing this info.,HistoryPorn,csy595r,3,t5_2skqi

The fact that some people still support the monster that was Pinochet or remember when people where actually calling for a military intervetion before the coup should speak volumes about how complicated the issue is. I dont know if youre a fellow chilean or from somewhere else but what you said reeks of first world paternalism. Those stupid latinos voted for Pinochet because of the color of the flag! Haha silly latinos cant into democracy is an incredible insult especially when you consider the revolution in propagandafreedom of expression postcoup that the campaign for the No meant. People were informed and while I dont argue that a the thing with the flags was obviously an immoral attempt to influence the votes and b maybe a marginally low number of illiterate voters were tricked saying that its THE reason people voted for Pinochet or indeed that such a stupidly obvious trick could indeed convince a majority of the people is just insulting. People willingly voted for him. Thank God it wasnt a majority but you cant extricate him from the historical context. People were afraid of Pinochet but they were also afraid of the left in an hypothetical way because of living in the midst of the Cold War because of American and other western influences and because of memories of problems that existed during Allende and the UPs government that eventually ended with the coup. As I said previosly plenty of people not a huge majority but still a large enough number to be worrysome still celebrate or fondly remember the dictator.Hell Pinochet may have won the referendum to legitimize the new constitution but he lost the election for staying in power the very same election you say everyone voted yes because of a drawing of a flag is the election that ousted him. Im sorry if I come across as aggressive and I highly doubt you intended to insult my country or countrymen but sharing these kinda anecdotes like this everyone voted for him! And they did it because they were too stupid to tell yes and no apart without both having colorful flags! especially in a place where the average reader may not know much of the time and place it just paints us as stupid and the whole complicated and quite horrible historical event as farcical. ,HistoryPorn,ctx351r,26,t5_2skqi

I suppose I was at an age when I could understand what was happening but was experiencing it for the first time.But even Freddies death shows you the stigma which surrounded the disease as it was only announced the day before he died that he had AIDS. His death did have an impact on the cause but its sad to think he didnt feel comfortable talking about it beforehand. Its also heart breaking to think if he caught it now hes almost certainly be with us. I wonder if the stigma held back research into the disease and if others could have been saved sooner.,HistoryPorn,cudo201,9,t5_2skqi

4954289,0,t1_cuizs5i,gt Basic identification seems sensible. Do you have any reason that it isnt?Yes.  Because theres no compelling reason for it.  There is no evidence that people are voting inperson as other people.Voter ID laws are proven to disproportionately affect the poor and minorities.  Thats exactly what they are designed to do.  There is no reasonable explanation for the voter ID laws that are being proposed by Republicans....other than it serves to keep away voters who traditionally vote Democrat.You seem to think its reasonable because its just a silly ID.....and you have to show ID to buy beer or cigarettes.  Ive heard other people say They need ID to get their welfare benefits....why not to vote?  Thats easy...because voting is a right and welfare benefits are a privilege given by the government.  Voter ID laws are only resonable if they serve to address a problem with the system.  Since nobody is impersonating someone else to show up in person to vote in their stead.......these laws are not reasonable.,HistoryPorn,cuj10vo,2,t5_2skqi

Algeria was France.A group of terrorists similar to ISIS tried to have independence by using terror attacks against BOTH the MUSLIMS and the French colonials.The war was extremely brutal because the terrorists used any means necessary including killing women and children and bomb attacks on civilians to get their way.Actually the war was the finest hour of the French military which won it on paper. However it was a dark hour because De Gaulle then betrayed the military by giving independence to Algeria also thus condemning millions of French loyalists Muslims to death and torture.Algeria has been ruled since by the terrorists and has essentially transformed from a beautiful colonial culture to a nonplayer and center of Jihad in North Africa.

5916206,0,t1_cxv48fo,Yes the M was a much different weapon from the Carl Gustav.  The Carl Gustav isnt much different from the M which is also a man portable recoilless rifle.The M was largely used on vehicles such as the Ontos which carried  Ms on it.  They could also be effectively mounted on a variety of Jeeps and similar vehicles.  It could also be setup on a tripod and used as a ground crewed weapon.In general the M was more akin to a field cannon than to a man portable system.  The main benefits of the M and the reasons it was used over smaller man portable options?  Significantly longer range increased accuracy and increased payload though mostly the range and accuracy were the big deals.  To put this in perspective the Carl Gustav has an effective range of about km.   An M which came out later and was more focused on range basically doubled that to a bit over km while also being slightly biggerunwieldy.  The M or mm recoilless rifle had a range over km.Because of its overall larger size it could also be effectively used for flechette rounds making it essentially an oversized shotgun effective out to meters or so.  This is what they were largely used for in Vietnam they would be setup in defensive positions on hilltops in cities during the Tet Offensive etc and basically became area denial weapons.  This is also something the Carl Gustav M and similar man portable options simply didnt do realistically if at all.  TLDR The mm recoilless rifle aka M was basically the bigger badder fixed positioning or vehicle mounted brother of the man portable recoilless rifles like the Carl Gustav M etc.  It could also fill in other rolls due to is payload size.,HistoryPorn,cxv59wd,20,t5_2skqi
5917052,0,t3_3wdat5,gt Astronaut Edward H. White II pilot for the GeminiTitan  space flight floats in space during Americas first spacewalk. The extravehicular activity EVA was performed during the Gemini  mission on June  . White spent  minutes maneuvering around his spacecraft as Jim McDivitt remained inside the spacecraft. White is attached to the spacecraft by a ft. umbilical line and a ft. tether line both wrapped in gold tape to form one cord. In his right hand White carries a HandHeld Self Maneuvering Unit HHSMU which he used to help move him around the weightless environment of space. The visor of his helmet is gold plated to protect him from the unfiltered rays of the sun.gt The spacewalk started at  p.m. EDT on the third orbit when White opened the hatch and used the handheld manuevering oxygenjet gun to push himself out of the capsule.gt The EVA started over the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii and lasted  minutes ending over the Gulf of Mexico. Initially White propelled himself to the end of the meter tether and back to the spacecraft three times using the handheld gun. After the first three minutes the fuel ran out and White maneuvered by twisting his body and pulling on the tether.In a photograph taken by Commander James McDivitt taken early in the EVA over a cloudcovered Pacific Ocean the maneuvering gun is visible in Whites right hand.

6148189,0,t1_cyodx8z,To add to the other response at this point air combat was very new and untested. Specifically in the US where isolationism was big there were questions regarding the utility of an air force as any threat to the US would be naval. The goal of these exercises were to prove the need for a larger modern air force. At this point aerial bombing was believed to generally be inaccurate and ineffective. It was not thought to pose any threat to ships. The sinking of BB was a multiday exercise to show a variety of ways ships could be attacked from the air including I believe night attacks culminating in the actual sinking if the ship. It was also practice in the actual development of airtosea combat tactics which were pretty much theoretical at the time.If I recall correctly General Billy Mitchell was actually fired for ordering these exercises and it would be many years before the results were put to use. The US only maintained a small air arm right up to the run up to WWII. General Mitchell would later have a medium bomber the B named after him.Edit I want to add Mitchell was probably rightfully pushed out he was also antagonizing the navy. The part of this exercise I forgot about it that he was also trying to prove that any naval fleet was obsolete in the face of air power.,HistoryPorn,cyohglk,9,t5_2skqi

6212819,0,t1_cytlccl,Yes I would agree that liberating women is a good thing for the economy in general. And many subsistence cultures also subjugate women. You dont see female genital mutilation in societies that have their shit together. Also you presume that playing the role of police man has no benefit in tribal societies. Unfortunetly there are many good reasons and some seeiminly bad ones why people would miss treat women. I would bet good money that the average treatment of women relitive to men is worse in developing countries than the west. I would recomend reading a book about the moral consiquences of growth. Its thesis was that in times of growth more liberal laws were passed. ie votes for women the economically richer north being against slavery german pensions I forget the title of the book but Ill post it when I get home. ,HistoryPorn,cyvtwuj,1,t5_2skqi

In reality soldiers knew this was an awful setup and took as many automatic weapons as they could. Towards the end of the war the US realized their mistake and provided pools of unissued automatic weapons to company and battalion commanders to hand out it took until Korea to actually fix the problem.In Korea a US platoon had  squads of  men same number of troops as the last war but divided better. Of these squads  were rifle squads and  a machine gun squad. The rifle squads would be issued  BARs each by the end of the war while the machine gun squad carried  Ma machine guns.So a WW US Army company would officially have  BARs and  Mas while a Korean War company would have  BARs and  Mas given to units of similar size.This is a much superior setup then WW and in fact the basic tenants  Rifle Squads with  SAW supported  support squad with two MGs are still in use today though of course the weapons today are far superior.gt How long were mortars a part of platoon weaponry in the U.S. army?

They both had a tendency to say rather outrageous things and they both attracted some dubious supporters though.For political positions Id say Goldwater was more extreme but he knew what he believed.

This is just being used to create the illusion of very tight security.Xrays images are created by attenuation of a Xray beam. The more radiation that gets through the brighter the image. Thats why the lungs are so bright the lungs are mainly gas so most of the Xrays get through. The bones contain calcium and minerals so they block a higher percentage of the Xrays and make darker shadows on the screen. Xray attenuation is proportional to the atomic number of the material raised to the third power. Hiding a pure carbon diamond atomic number  inside a carbon   oxygen  hydrogen and nitrogen  body will mean the diamond will blend in with the surrounding tissues especially using a portable fluoro screen in the s.

7860655,1,t1_d3zjpvp,Youre trying to hold the definition of socialism to its historical context like saying all forms of socialism are essentially Marxism but they absolutely are not. The same can be said for most peoples understanding of the definition of capitalism or free market capitalism in the original context. What we have now in the United States isnt really that either. The government set price floors and ceilings all the time throughout he entire economy. They dont do it because its fashionable or for fun. They do it because totally unrestrained capitalism can have a myriad of negative effects. Try to adopt your understanding of the terms to the modern context and you should realize that there is ample room for the application of aspects of both systems within a single economy.,HistoryPorn,d3zlx1c,-1,t5_2skqi

Shame at the community knowing you were related to a gay. Worry about how this relation would affect your standing in your church your neighborhood your family and among your friends.  And yes you almost certainly would have a church.  Just like youd probably be Muslim if you had been born in Saudi Arabia.

Also on a personal note I have seen this photo several times but until now I had never realized that I have actually been in that square. Obviously it looks rather different postWW.It was almost ten years ago I was there but at the time there was a protest of some description going on in a nearby square and surrounding streets. The police had preemptively blocked the road that the nazis marched down towards the square in the photo during the beer hall putsch.

In private the president would often tell a joke or anecdote that would illuminate the meaning of his visit.  After reading these glowing accounts of Lincolns skill as a conversationalist some even from his political enemies were then presented with excerpts from General McClellans diary in which he complains of having to listen to another one of Lincolns boring stories and how he could hardly pay attention when the man spoke.  It was like he and the President spoke different languages.

Ongais came into the pits on lap  as the leader of the race but problems during the stop caused it to drag on for a disastrous  seconds. After finally leaving the pits Ongais approached a slower car at the end of the backstretch. He made a late pass going into turn . Carrying too much speed out of the turn the car drifted out into the grey and the back end began to slide. Ongais tried to correct the slide by turning right and the car hooked to the right and crashed nearly headon into the wall. He was knocked unconscious by the heavy impact. Officials had to cut open the car to help Ongais out. He was airlifted to a nearby hospital in a critical condition. By the time the broadcasting of the race ended at  PM Ongaiss condition had improved and his condition was updated to stable. He suffered a concussion compound fractures in both legs a broken arm and a inch tear in his diaphragm.

They also needed to get on the Japanese good side to stop USSR from taking too many of their islands.

They needed the government to surrender officially to prove to the Japanese people that they could no longer fight.  Had the Japanese government never capitulated the Japanese people would have likely continued causing problems possibly as an insurgent threat.Also like was said above because of the terrible experience with the Philippines the US did not want to occupy foreign territory and having to put down an insurgent threat would have probably required occupation.

The farmer was a Ukrainian guard with the job of keeping an eye on the area.The holocaust started at a time when the Reich was ascendant. They were winning the war and could plan on never being challenged about their actions. Then suddenly they started losing  decisions were made to kill as many as possible as fast as possible as some sort of twisted legacy and then to close the camps as the Russians and Allies got close.Perhaps if the Reich had lasted longer the cover up would have been more effective. The mass exodus of Nazis to places like Argentina post war to avoid capture certainly suggests they knew they were in trouble.

11010665,0,t3_5x2hmu,For those nonAussies wondering what the hell a bushranger is heres what wikipedia has to saygtBushrangers were originally escaped convicts in the early years of the British settlement of Australia who had the survival skills necessary to use the Australian bush as a refuge to hide from the authorities. By the s the term bushranger had evolved to refer to those who abandoned social rights and privileges to take up robbery under arms as a way of life using the bush as their base.gtBushranging thrived during the gold rush years of the s and s when the likes of Ben Hall Frank Gardiner and John Gilbert led notorious gangs in the country districts of New South Wales. These Wild Colonial Boys mostly Australianborn sons of convicts were roughly analogous to British highwaymen and outlaws of the American Old West and their crimes typically included robbing smalltown banks and coach services. In other infamous cases such as that of Dan Morgan the Clarke brothers and Australias bestknown bushranger Ned Kelly numerous policemen were murdered. The number of bushrangers declined due to better policing and improvements in rail transport and communication technology such as telegraphy. Kellys capture and execution in  effectively represented the end of the bushranging era.gtBushranging exerted a powerful influence in Australia lasting for almost a century and covering much of the continent. Its origins in a convict system bred a unique kind of desperado frequently with an Irish political background. Nativeborn bushrangers also expressed nascent Australian nationalist views and are recognised as the first distinctively Australian characters to gain general recognition. As such many bushrangers became folk heroes and symbols of rebellion against the authorities. Firmly entrenched in Australian folklore bushrangers have inspired many works in the arts including bush ballads plays and films.TLDR Bushrangers were the Australian version of British highwaymen and the outlaws of the American Wild West. Ned Kelly was the best known of them. Kelly in particular has become a cult figure particularly to those with an antiauthoritarian streak.,HistoryPorn,deg10xv,3,t5_2skqi

This meant that manufacturing where labour is expensive U.S to be close to the consumer base was no longer viable and cities like new york lost their manufacturing sector.With the rise of the internet and information technology in general we may actually see a decline in the prominence of cities like New York because these technologies reduce the need for people to work in close proximityI disagree if anything it will help global finance greatly.

Making things worse theres a deep vein of thought that conflates wealth with virtue and poverty with vice which only exaggerates the poverty traps. So instead of acknowledging that anyone mightcould forge a check in this case to feed a hungry child the assumptions tend toward him being a vile offscouring of humanity.Obviously these are generalizations.

11432278,0,t1_dfrnbh6,gt They look very westernized. I know hardly anything about Japan in this time period but I assume the imperial government would have been pushing a return to more traditionally Japanese cultural norms. Well following the Japanese Boshin civil warrevolution in the late s the imperial court actually began looking to the West for inspiration in order to modernize Japan.  By the s Japan was experiencing many of the same cultural trends as could be found in the West at the time One such example was the New National Diet Building completed in  which was built in the artdeco style .Regarding the westernized look of the uniforms Japan heavily invested in westernizing their military after the Boshin war bringing the French in four separate times to train their military between the end of the Boshin war and WW.  In addition Japan also sought and received military training from Germany and on several occasions the UK during the same period.  As a result their uniforms developed a western look.EDIT For those interested heres a brief and pretty entertaining overview of Japanese history.,HistoryPorn,dfru53k,5,t5_2skqi

11641410,0,t1_dgesdoz,The ultimate goal has long been deterrence MAD sure. But for the deterrent to be effective it must be credible. The Soviets had to be convinced that the USs weapons were capable of performing their intended functions one of which was taking out hardened bunkers. Hence the US built really big bombs.As the USs aim improved it could credibly claim that smaller weapons could do the same job. So the big weapons were mothballed or dismantled because smaller weapons had the same deterrent effect.Taking my comment as a whole I think its fairly obvious that I was explaining why the US has reduced the average yield of its weapons. I was not offering a reason for the existence of nuclear weapons. So I think your charge that I was completely wrong is both uncharitable and incorrect.,HistoryPorn,dgfkfo0,1,t5_2skqi

As far as Clintons pardon it is typical for an outgoing president to issue  pardons as they leave office for people they may feel were wrongly accused or were of a political nature. I am sure the Hearst family had been seeking a pardon for a while and Reagan didnt issue one Clinton did. Its mostly symbolic and could have been done for a number of reasons he also pardoned  other people his last day in office. ,HistoryPorn,dgfq8kg,21,t5_2skqi

Why is it okay to have an exposed flaccid penis with kids around but not an erection? Whats the difference? Its fine for kids to see normal penises but obscene for them to see erect ones? If nudism is about being comfortable around others as your natural self isnt sexuality necessarily a part of that? Were sexual creatures after all. It seems odd to be fine with exposing kids to human body but draw the line at the merest suggestion of human sexuality. Im not saying its okay to start fucking at the nude beach or anything but it seems strange to me that youre suggesting one should be embarrassed about having an erection.,HistoryPorn,dgpap4d,58,t5_2skqi
