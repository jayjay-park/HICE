4816201,0,t1_cu1lvlw,yes this is possible but the order and timing has to be perfect.. your team MUST start the fight first not you.. there can be no CC peeler defending their carry or youll get stunned and die. it greatly helps if your team has heavy AOE stuns like amumu ult or morganas ult. a GA will greatly help in surviving the fight.shaco is far better at assassinating a single target and then assisting in cleanup after a fight has been won. unless you build him bruiser he shouldnt actually be in the teamfight but jump in and out of it.,shacomains,cu1mdsn,1,t5_37875

5750864,0,t3_3tu88z,Some stuff I got while learning and recite to anyone who asks me for help...Runes Whatevers comfortable for you at first but generally MS quints and AS somewhere. Hybrid pen reds arent worth it AD is just fine. You can take MRlvl blues or AP blues.Yellows can be armor or more attack speed. Masteries Theres a lot of options but it depends on how you personally play too.General tips. Dont max w second. if anything put only a nd point into it  then max q. Dont be greedy with your qunless you have bluebuff. Especially early. At rank one its  mana which is a lot.  w  e iircThrowing your Shive too soon. You lose your passive slow. E is why people take AP bluesthis becomes irrelevant semi quickly.If youre split pushing drop boxes behind you to kite to.Also put them behind your team if youve grouped up.Something you must always remember   adapt. Do not pidgeon hole yourself into a certain build Sometimes bruiser is better sometimes full ad sometimes splitting is better sometimes grouping. Learning to juggle aggro on dragon and using your ult to dodge pesky cc Ahri charm are some amazing things to learn.But most importantly..dont stress. Shacos an amazingly versatile champion who can be played many ways and in many roles. I play him everything and effectively.  Personally Im a snowball player and dont take the highly inefficientimo CDR at all in runes since you dont really need it. I run AD reds AS yellowsampblues and MS quints generally but occasionally will hop back to AD reds armor yellows and AP blues with MS quints. Play the game ask for any help here and just try to find your shaco. Theres so much more I could say since Ive long collected advice from some of the better shaco players and people who spent countless hours answering me.

7706831,0,t3_4kugqp,Manamune wastes so much stats that the Iceborn Gauntlet argument does not hold well. Early game lt min you are doing  less damage than you are supposed to and instead of creating pressure youre busy stacking your tear. At  min you have a Murumana instead of two of the following items Tiamat Warhammer Zeal Sheen. IMO You give up way too much early and mid game in hopes that the bonus you get late game will make up for it. After a rough calculation Murumana  Iceborn Gauntlet give approximately  AD from Awe and up to  dmg from Shock. Essentially late game you are hitting for  initial  physical damage per attack with an attack speed of around . attacks per second. Theres a problem with this you cant burst Jinx at all If we assume Jinx has  HP with no resistances it takes  seconds to kill her.  seconds for Leona to realize what youre doing and ult or stun you.  seconds for Rek Sai to tunnel at you and knock you up.  seconds for Leblanc to glance at you burst you down then continue doing Leblanc things. When you factor in resistances and lifesteal this window of death becomes wider. With assassin build you can at least beeline for the squishies and kill them FAST. You should have been on Jinxs ass the majority of the teamfighting phase especially since no one bought sweeper and very few even considered buying a pink. Jinx should have died way more that match as you were the only guy who could get to the backlineThe mixed damage isnt important unless you are dueling tanks because squishies can just build GA and the entire point of building hybrid is to avoid building penetration items. But Rek Sai has tons of ways to escape using her tunnels Swain can heal indefinitely and Leona can stunlock you until help arrives. Shaco already has waveclear with the standard Tiamat build. With the HydraShiv assassin build Shacos single target burst can also affect nearby squishies as well potentially making a ZyraAshe hiding in a bush an easy double kill. Shaco doesnt really have mana problems outside of his first clear buy jungle potion or take every blue so you can still work around mana without buying tear anyways. And late game mana isnt even a consideration unless you havent backed for like  minutes.You could make the argument that Manamune Shaco can build tank items but standard HydraShiv Shaco can also build tank items. Its true that Hydra will hit slightly less hard than Manamune but that is because with Hydra you also get waveclear an active that pretty much deals a second weaker auto attack and lifesteal as sustain.Its an interesting experiment but I feel as though the standard Hydrashiv build already accomplishes what the Manamune but better.,shacomains,d3i7raz,3,t5_37875

Therefore buying crit on him is actually pointless because theres a chance that a crit auto will be replaced with a backstab crit which is shit.   gt  gtMost Shaco players right now are either abusing the overly buffed AP Shaco the slightly buffed DPSBruiser Shaco or are desperately trying to find a way to bring AD Shaco into reality. Nothing like running  crit damage in my runes in an attempt to make this work amirite?   gt  gtNow dont get me wrong they had the right idea here you know making assassins not burst you instantly so you can react but I personally think it failed since well... it killed the main playstyle of the champion entirely.  gt  gt All Riot really has to do is just make his passive add  bonus damage to the attack at levels  instead of replacing the attack with one that deals  at levels .   gt  gtThis would change nothing about AP Shacos damage or bruiser Shacos damage but it would make crit Shacos damage comparable to what it was before. If anything the number can be lowered and the cooldown could be lowered too and Q AP ratio increased by . so that its still an actual nerf to AD assassin Shaco while keeping everything else the same.   gt  gtCompared to old AD Assassin Shacos burst the current rework with the proposed changes would still have a much healthier powercurve damage scales with levels a much better team fight and a much worse splitpush rip clone. It would fix a lot of the issues this rework presented while also keeping the issues prior to the rework resolved.   gt  gtI know theres others who agree with me.  gt  gtEdit These two elaborated for me more or less   gt  gtgt ChickenWrap wrote on   gtgt  gtgt If the best Shaco build looks like this  gtgt   gtgt itemAether Wisp  Enchantment Runic Echoes itemSorcerers Shoes itemHextech Gunblade itemLich Bane itemRabadons Deathcap itemInfinity Edge   gtgt   gtgt We might have a problem here Riot.

One could argue the crit being  chance is much makes the  damage nerf from a standard crit ok however when looking at previous Crit Shaco build  gtgt itemInfinity Edge itemStatikk Shiv itemPhantom Dancer itemEssence Reaver itemTitanic Hydra   gtgt before the rework was a great build netting you a  guarantee that your first auto would do  Hit if hit from behind.  gtgt This build was the late game a place you at riot said would be getting the power lost in early however now the hit from behind is  when hitting from the FRONT would be . Now I have no problem with the nerfs but if playing the champion incorrectly is worse than correctly there is an issue. With Workshop Shacos change the hit would be  which is in fact still a nerf from before but its not over  like it is now and would reward skillful play of shaco in the late game again.  gt  gtEdit  Another fix would be making the damage from backstab scale with Shacos crit chance as well as any crit damage amplifiers. This would allow all current playstyles go unchanged while also making the late game expensive oriented AD Shaco builds do what they deserve to do. Just a thought.  This comment was created by a bot.

9794636,0,t1_dahg3qs,gt No reason to take them imo but if someone wants to purely for late game burst while negating all else I can understand that.Thing is both runes even out after your jungle item.  Crit damage even beats flat AD at the jungle item if you go runic echoes.  I just gave a late game damage since the runes focus is scaling.  It doesnt mean it doesnt do anything mid game.  Crit damage also wins massively against objectives and bruisers.  Against a jayce or fiora its highly likely youll get multiple crits either from yourself or from your ult.  Having an extra  AD scaling against baron every  aas.  Or just call it  every aa is gonna be huge to put it to size.  I do think the runes are dependent on what playstyle you want to use.  I cant agree that theres no reason to take crit damage runes though.  gt Also with crit damage reds it requires you to micromanage your clear to hit backstab when its off cooldown which will be harder for new players esp since it does not give a specific CD timer.You should be doing this no matter what.  Your passive is a  AD skill even without crit runes.  If you dont micromanage it youre throwing away your clear speed.  Either way its not a good argument saying it takes skill to use a rune.  gt damage is huge when against the likes of a strong early jungler like Lee Xin Udyr etc. They are stronger but if they fight next to your box that AD and ignite is going to come out to be huge.I agree here.   dmg is  of their hp early game just like  dmg is  of their hp late game.  I never said anything negative about this in my original post.  I kept my first comment objective just saying the benefits of each.  This comment though Im defending against crit runes being useless which I really dont agree with.  ,shacomains,dakefrt,1,t5_37875

I play hybrid Shaco and its the first item I get. With Shacos new passive youre able to full clear jungle and keep up with meta junglers but you also want the Tiamat so you can later on clear KrugsRaptors fast and keep the CSXP advantage up.I would also advise not to play AP Shaco. I realise it can be good but you can get countered simply by an enemy building a hexdrinker. If you want a build with around the same burst as AP but with the duelling power youll go for the hybrid build. As a long time Shaco main I can definitely say its the pretty much the best build in a long time. You cant get countered by resists and there isnt really much missing from it.My build is Machete gt Tiamat gt Runic Echoes gt Gunblade gt Sheen gt Titanic Hydra  TriForce either order gt BotRK.,shacomains,dar65go,3,t5_37875

9976840,0,t3_5ie96k,The world doesnt make sense to me anymore. We want to introduce more counterplay so assassins cant oneshot you anymoreWe want to make rengar shaco khazix least feast or famine... buff all assassin remove pink ward make Shaco FRAKING undetectable give ap scaling to a champ that does ad auto so he cant farm a jungle where a god damn chicken can make you  bitch slap the early game with a Q that last till you blink make the assassin items suck ass by droping the ad not rewarding snowballing and assassination... THEN nerf all the assassin so everybody wonder why play a risky feast or famine more complex to play anyway champion who cant oneshot while mages can still burst with utility from a distance. But hey still ap shaco can oneshot right? Nerf that shit. Thats some great assassin rework there! The problem was always that assassin by definition DELETE target and make people rage. When an assassin stab you in the shower he doesnt warn you and let you put bullet in your shotgun. The role of assassin was incompatible with a healthy game. But instead of giving tools to deal AGAINST assassin they destroyed the assassin skillset. The ap shaco nerf is just another exemple of RIOT slowly destroying assassins and locking the champion in one build one gameplay.They could have created a buff that give temporary stealth detection so like when we gave blue to mid we could have given that buff to the squishy target. They could have created an item like edge of the night for adc so they have some sort of damage mitigation. They created an item sharing damage with the support it was a good step in the right direction. In my opinion the assassin items are a failure until they buff them and bruiser who abuse trinityblack cleavertitaniccinderhulk will continue dominating with better farming dueling sustain in jungle utility and onhit damage.,shacomains,db80dl1,2,t5_37875

10103062,0,t3_5kjypm,You always want to have your teammates scout the entrances of your jungle most enemy teams will retreat the moment they are spotted. If you know the enemy will most likely invade they have Blitzcrank etc try getting your team to stack in the most likely way the Blitzcrank will invade youll want to drop a box in that brush before you go back to boxing up your buff a small price for a possibly high reward outcome. If you know the enemy teams lvl  is stronger than yours or you only have  or  people defending leave for your other buff immediately when you see the invade. In either of these cases you should heavily consider using your early ward to spot for invades. In the case where your buff does get stolen the enemy jungler will often not have the time to go get his tobe rd buff so youll want to go steal that away. Keep close tabs on the minimap and pings from your teammates when doing these early invades. And ofc sometimes you cant do anything about your buff getting stolen and the enemy being able to defend their own jungle. Thats when you try to farm up the rest of your jungle as effectively as possible do not go for risky ganks and make sure you do not get counterganked when you do go for one. Also be careful not to gank lanes that are lvl  or close to  while you andor your laners only are lvl  otherwise you will often find yourself on the losing side of the early game possibly even causing the enemy team to snowball into a victory. ,shacomains,dbofway,2,t5_37875

If you keep track of which lane has a flash advantage more cc or is pushing thats pretty easy. Put deep wards in the enemy jungle.If theres multiple lane pushing really hard ward and farm a lot its hard to predict which will be ganked but still prepare the jungler to gank the weakest one in term of cc escapes kills.For the silver hell in think focussing on objective control is key  way before counterjungling.

I do know that the backstabbing is obvious to take advantage of but I felt the need to mention it still since it can make or break raptors if you arent keeping it in mind due to their new damage output.I assume no skill cap minimum for the viewer at all in the video so I dont leave out even what would seem very obvious to an experienced shaco main.About the box placement its mainly my preferred way of placement. I dont care much for the game positioning my boxes through its own mechanics unless I am specifically using it from a strategic position.Starting raptors or buff may break even. I didnt do this in the video but I could have left that last box to finish off the camp and started walking towards the camp for the steal.
