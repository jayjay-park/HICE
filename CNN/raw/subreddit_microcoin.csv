410476,0,t3_1ypphb,Very informative.Although you find Vertcoin more interesting in the way they implemented the variable N factor I dont think its so decisive for the future of the coin.Even LTC could fork to a more memory consuming implementation of the scrypt algo and then be less asic friendly...Microcoin can do that too.Lets be clear its good to think about the future but for now scrypt asics are just coming on the market how many month before graphic card miners get pushed out of scrypt mining because of asic ?It took more than  month for mining farm using graphic cards to stop mining BTC my guess is we have more than a year before seeing any drastic changes.Yes graphic cards will still be very profitable for a couple of months.So the N factor variables are just preparing a battle that havent take place yet.Microcoin is not only about scrypt asic resistance its about speed its about energy saving PoSPoW its about distribution.This in my opinion makes it superior to Vertcoin.Vertcoin choose the same time block as LTC and chose the same scarcity model.Microcoin is more on the Dogecoin side for the coin supply aspect.That is what saved Dogecoin from remaining a joke and made it a serious player.Scarcity reduce the usage and user base of a coin Dogecoin showed that with a lot of coins you look more friendly for new comers to the crypto world.Thank you for writing this blog its one of my favorite read about cryptos and its always very interesting.,microcoin,cfnb8xf,2,t5_2zqda
