1268966,0,t3_277bl0,As someone who has used a lot of Vaughn Velocity growing up and the popularity of velocity to even today I figure why not post something in regard to the difference between V and V and the different variations    etc based on my experience.Vaughn pads compared to Brians and Reebok which I have used are heavier. They also generally have more protection which makes sense. But the thing with Vaughn goalie pads is they have a unique and amazing feel. They are probably the most flexible goalie pads three point bend at the the knee. Its tough to explain but their feel is just more natural they wrap around your legs better they are more comfortable etc. I will add they dont slide as well as Reeboks or Brians but the overall feel makes up for it. From talking to other goalies at goalie camps shinny at goalie stores tryouts etc. it seems some people just fall for Vaughn while others dont and move on to lighter Reeboks or Brians. Ive heard some people say they refuse to wear anything other than Vaughns and wont even consider changing. One guy I heard tried Reebok Ps for the first time and hasnt look back. All up to personal preference. Pads Vaughn Velocity pads are great they are used frequently by NHL and other pro goalies today and have been over the past decade. The glove and blocker though...Blocker While the Velocity blocker is fine Ive liked other brands better or just as much. This opinion is shared by Corey Schneider  who has always used Vaughn pads and reebokCCM gloveblocker. Many goalies when getting a custom set actually go with the  blocker Ive never tried is but Ive heard great things. In Prices breakout year  he wore v pads witha  blocker the blocker is the  version here My buddy bought a former custom set of an OHL goalie which also had Velocity V pad and a  blocker. But the glove is the real problem...Glove The velocity glove is awful. Compared to other options such as Reebok and Brians it fails in comparison. It doesnt fail at protection but its design is weak and its heavy. Simply put its tougher to catch a puck than it should be I know the pocket isnt very deep. Quick is the only goalie Ive seen use the actual velocity glove. Me Ive got a V set but with a Vaughn Epic glove love it. Its very common for goalies with full Vaughn sets to get a Vaughn epicvision glove coincidentally lighter stiffer sets. As for the difference between V and V graphically Id say nothing beats Vaughn V best although V is still pretty good very similar to mine When shopping velocity pads the difference between V and V is very minor. V is just a bit of an upgrade protection wise and the straps I believe are different what really matters is the version example . These tell you the quality of the pads how light they will be the quality etc.Its tough to point out specific differences besides weight but you can tell a major difference right away between  and . Thats were you are also going to see the price go up or down and thats were youre going to make the decision on what youre looking for when buying used velocities. Vaughn V  are still not that cheap and overpriced at anything above  for a full set. If you look around and maybe wait a bit you can probably get a V set for the same price as the higher end Vs got a steal on my V set . Also note many Vs get custom graphics. Vaughn  and Iceberg are common graphics on VVV pads. Same feel for the goalie but different look. I wrote this based on the GTA goalie market on Kijiji were I have always gotten my pads,hockeygoalies,cicdioh,1,t5_2tf80

I am by no means a great skater and I started out as a goalie first.I dont find it beneficial in anyway for improving your skating playing one or the other as they involve completely different actions and movements.It will help getting started but once you learn how to play net you really wont resort to your player skating ability. For example my goalie skates are so sharp when I get them done cant afford that every time I am on the ice! I can barely skate out of the net and handle the puck less. But movement around the crease and sliding around is amazing.

I could barely move at first and then gradually got better.When my first league game came around I played on a team of individual signups  some coworkers I let in two goals in the first five minutes and thought... oh god... this is going to be bad. I then stopped every shot the remainder of regulation and our team tied it . We went into a five minute overtime where with  seconds left the other team got a dirty goal to win it.I thought this meant a lot of good times on the horizon. That team went  over the next two seasons. Eventually we split up and all found a lot of success elsewhere. Ive now played in leagues ranging from A level to D level as a goalie.

Ive played with a lot of bad teams over the years just so I can get my time in and work on things. When the team is bad I just focus on me making sure I am doing everything with good fundamentals I communicate with the D in front of me and keep plugging away. Keep going to pick up get your name on their goalie call list and get your nameface out there. Someone will pick you up  its happened to me in SD when I lived in LA too. You just get out there and work hard and people notice and next thing you know someone is asking you play for them. Once you find the right core of a team stick with them be dependable practice with them etc.East County is tough cuz you pretty much only have Skate SD near you and they are pretty pricey from what I remember but check into pick up times for ice at Kroc SDIA amp Poway soon. Give the place a call or drop in some time tell them your story and see what they recommend. They can recommend when to come out and any classes they offer.

5193355,0,t3_3m4141,Ive had pain before and always have more after a breakbeing a bit lazy with warmups and off ice workout. Its lack of strength mobility and active flexibility that will result in most pain so whatever exercise you do its good to keep at least some of it goalie specific. From the way you describe it Id say it sounds like something you should focus on which its great that you are asking about it. Mobility exercises foam rollers and such  help a huge deal. Good warm up and at least a short after ice workout will do a lot. At least for me it does. Im no expert but I think Ive gone through similar stuff to you. If you wanted to pick just one quick thing to do to keep it simple and easy then make it the foam roller and just do that most days. Makes a huge difference. Cheers. ,hockeygoalies,cvbzrce,1,t5_2tf80
5303294,0,t3_3nn28p,Id say definitely get new skates. I think bauer makes the best skates with their amazing cowling but Im sure other people disagree with their own valid reasons. I also hundred percent agree with mikeyo and the step steel sentiment. Skates and steel are such an underrated important upgrade for your game. Pads gloves etc look cool and are fun but skating is by far the most important thing for a goalie so your wheels need to be on point.As for your five hole Im not exactly sure how youre trying to close your legs but generally the key is squeezing your knees thats how you seal your five hole. Also I dont know your skill level or knowledge but a big issue a lot of beginner goalies have is jumpingfalling to the ice for a butterfly. Dont rely purely on gravity to help you close your five hole and seal to the ice DRIVE your knees into the ice. You have a bunch of padding and all that good stuff so it wont hurt.Another bad habit is leaving your stick by your side. Keep that in front of your five hole so even if you make a mistake your stick is still there. Keep your hands and stick lead out in front of you to avoid falling on your stick. Also keeping your hands in front of you both in your stance and as you make saves is generally good practice and another super underrated important technique.A lot of coaches preach using your stick to cover everything on the ice. This is useful for sending rebounds away and into the cornersnetting. Other schools of thought believe you should use your pads to make saves and your stick to corral rebounds. If you have a quick butterfly with a good seal you can really absorb those five hole shots with your knee pads. Back before they reduced the legal knee pad size guys like giguere and luongo were great at this.In my opinion you should just figure out what works for you. Whatever is more comfortable and figure out what plays to your strengths. Since you used to be a center maybe youll have a really good active stick for deflecting and ramping pucks to the corner with your stick. Remember theres no one set way to play goalie just figure out what way works for you and if it makes a reasonable amount of sense. ,hockeygoalies,cvpk3ao,3,t5_2tf80

6538141,0,t3_455kje,  is what i use Higher framerate is better. More pictures every second   fps is lots. I also have the black  with it  you can do p fps and really slow it down. fps will still produce some nice slo mo and fps is pretty much overkill but maybe youre playing with some really fast guys you want to analyze in SUPER slo mo?.... You can if you like. instead of  will save you some battery life and card space but wont look quite as sharp. I can see a difference and while its not huge  this is resolution or the number of pixels in each frame is just nicer. I used to run out of battery before my game was over until i got the battery backpack addon. With it i can start my camera during last  mins of game before and get dressed while zamboni is out record my game x stop time and it usually dies while the next game is warming up. This includes  zamboni passes. Its about ish minutes of recording at  fps for me if i remember. The batteries dont work as well in the cold i think. the battery backpack feels like a must have to me but my teammate runs one as well and doesnt seem to need the it and he gets whole games so it may not be a must for everybody? My problem is i have to mount it outside the glass per league rules. I suction cup to the outside of the glass and stick the camera above it slightly so its a clean view. I cant start it manually as the game starts because its at the top of the glass. I have to start it when i hang it or use the phone app which has failed me only twice but feels like twice too many so i play it super safe and start way early and record too much and edit it out later. You may have more control as you plan to put it in the net so you will have access to the camera and can start and stop without the app or the need to find a ladder.

6709413,0,t3_47ja4f,Is this a clinic for goalies too?  Or is it just a skaters clinic and they asked a goalie to come out so the shooters had something between them and the net?If its the latter then thats really what it boils down to.  You werent there to learn the skaters were.  Even coaches at organized levels of hockey dont understand how to run drills that benefit both the skater and the goalie so Im not surprised the adult clinic coach didnt know how to either.As for the poor quality shots youre facing its beginner adult hockey.  Many times you run into people who hare a decent enough shot theyre adults have played street hockey etc but can barely stand up on the ice.  This means that they have zero control over their shot and that means you wont be able to read the shot and react to ones that are coming in high and hot.Its kind of a winlose situation.  Yes you get more ice time but its not really goalie friendly.  Perhaps lesson learned and this clinic can find a new shooter tutor for next time.,hockeygoalies,d0db73p,7,t5_2tf80

7375968,0,t3_4gddtz,Only you can tell what you need to get into a good flow every goalie is different there.Generally speaking I suspect you see that effect not because the state your body is in but because of the state of your mind. I probably sound like a fortunecookie but If your mind is ready your body will follow.Exhaustion often leads to such a state of mind but in a competitive sport this isnt really a practical solution.Personally I need a state where I am focused to a degree that I tremble. Everything happening on the field seems to have happened more slowly in hindsight than it actually did yet my body is alert like a tight spring ready to explode into action.To get that I need to be really nervous and anxious. Even being scared is better for me than being relaxed and calm.But thats just me. If you need to be calm mind like water you need to find a way to get there without your body being exhausted. How you do that is on you to find out and then to make it a pregame routine.Might be meditating or doing ten pushups or some arbitrary stuff that just looks weird and superstitious to outsiders. Its all to manipulate your mind into the state you want it to have.The body just  needs to be warmed up and streched a little to avoid injury and tell it that its showtime but not to tire it out.

It was something of a running joke at Dave Wells GSBB clinics in and around Toronto guys kept trying to oneup each other with fewer and fewer straps. Incidentally that was also where and when I heard some of the first arguments about going sans toeties which really only became a big thing about a decade later.The principle was exactly the same as Scrivens that the only two meaningful control points LOTCs term on a modern pad were immediately below the kneejoint  that is right at the top of the calf  and at the toe.

8179199,0,t1_d4ziezf,Id argue that the only way the OP would have wanted to be that far out is if he had known the shooter was Dany Heatley and even then theres an argument against it.You have to account for both the shooter and the position on the ice. The shooters qualities would include general skill FHBH current balance etc. Crosby Giroux et al. can pick corners while getting thrown to the ice but most guys cant and even pro goalies get surprised by those ones. All you can do it tip your hat...If the shooters qualities are uncertain and you can still gauge pretty well from his skating that hes not Heatley and Heatley wasnt exactly known for his wheels! theres no advantage to maintaining that much depth. In this case nothing about the shooter suggested he had an mph welldisguised pinpoint snapper.Even if the shooter might be Heatleyesque being that far out forces you to skate more as the puck moves and more skating opens up more holes for him to pick to say nothing of making your H an enormous target.,hockeygoalies,d4zy6d8,1,t5_2tf80

8437546,0,t1_d5w7iyq,It seems kind of obvious and can be pointless advice but confidence is almost entirely the culprit of dropping for every shot.I had a big problem of doing this and I solved it in a  step process which fixed the individual issues that were causing this. First step was neverrarely going down in warmups and attempt to save every shot standing up. Even hole shots on the ice or at my knees I try to save standing this will give you a feel of how to move and build confidence of saving shots in your stance. If you drop in a lowno pressure situation youre gonna drop in a high pressure one every time and youll get picked apart.Second I focused on getting back to my feet after virtually every shot. The only times I dont regain my feet are when they are jamming my pad. Watching some of the higher level videos here and the really good goalies always regain their feet ASAP. Being mobile in the butterfly is good and essential but  of people are more mobile and stable standing up. Its much easier to change your direction from your stance than it is to switch your momentum on your knees.After you are comfortable saving low pressure shots standing and are used to popping back up immediately after a shot you can work on keeping your feet when possible. I try to not anticipate the shot and purely react to it and the read on the shot. If I dont get a good read cant see the full release partialfull screen puck on edge etc then I still find myself dropping by default. However once I picked a game to try to stay on my feet as much as possible try to pick one that is a lowpressure situation like a dropin or easy game I was able to keep my feet more and more. I still slide into shots outside of my reach but if Im square and properly challenge to the shot I only drop if its going to the bottom halfthird of the net. I am getting hit in the mask much less making a lot more shoulderelbow saves that would be tough grabs before. An added bonus is that it really discourages a shooter if you make the save standing up as it looks like its easy to you.Basically build the base from no pressure warmups getting used to keeping your feet. Then get confident in popping back up and down in tight situations. Finally after getting used to the feel of a save while standing confident in your ability to droppop up quickly and are used to reading the location of a shot while standing you can conserve your movements to only the necessary ones for the save. This should help in keeping your heart rate down and help keep your nerves down and focused on the play.I was slumping for a while in the Spring and this really helped me break out of it over the past week or two.,hockeygoalies,d5w8dye,1,t5_2tf80
8457713,0,t3_4vizpr,The three things I think getting better at that should help the most in no particular order.I tend to sink back into the net to much trying to stay out and challenge more.I go down to early and stay down to long I want to stay on my feet more.When going side to side tracking a play it is not uncommon for me to become badly off my angle. ,hockeygoalies,d5yqyx1,2,t5_2tf80

8630338,0,t3_4y0m0i,It really comes naturally after a while. Your bodymind will compensate for the pads hitting each other without much thought once you play in them enough. Our natural motion when shuffling is to have the pushing leg overlap the leading legs thigh rise. This usually happens because we shuffle in an arc so the leading leg naturally comes in a little closer. We rarely ever shuffle directly sideways like some camps and drills have us do blue line shuffles...ugh.Aside from getting more ice time and hours logged with the new pads you can always adjust one top strap to be slightly tighter than the other. That can help to bring one thigh rise under the other but is more useful for just being in your stance and when squaring up for a shot. Too tight could cause hole closure issues when in the butterfly.Pads will also tend to break in a little differently as well as a lot of goalies will rest their gloves on top of their pads when nothing is happening in their end. Usually one side gets a little more broken down than the other this way. Not saying that breaking them in like that is something you should do on purpose but it does happen over time.Good luck! Thats a big jump in pad size but if s fit you than you definitely needed the upgrade.,hockeygoalies,d6kebpl,1,t5_2tf80

10718389,0,t3_5t9ocv,Florida has a long tradition of investor groups coming in building up a team getting the local govs to pay for all the infrastructure import the players around the world win the championship in two years then sell off the team for a huge profit. So thats how hockey came to Florida.Second Florida is a population of transplants I was born and raised there in school there was only a handful of other kids who were even first gen so Yankee parents want to relive memories of their youth playing midget hockey. So they demand access to ice rinks for their kids in a place that thought ice was only used in tea. And if a buck can be made there are investors looking to cash in. Thats how ice rinks came to Florida. Hell the boondoggle of a town Im from drained some more swamp and built a rather nice ice rink. ,hockeygoalies,ddlitdk,2,t5_2tf80
