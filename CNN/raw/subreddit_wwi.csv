95213,0,t1_cep4p4e,That sounds like a really nice collection. My father just bought a Swiss pioneer bayonet that I plan on taking some pictures of but the German ones are very cool as well. I also love the idea of finding something that has basically been sitting around since the war ended and Im lucky in that regard to have recently met someone who does manages estate sales and promised to let me take a first look at any military related item she finds. Personally my main focus right now is on American WWII items because that tends to be right in my budget though I have a fairly respectable WWI collection as well. If you go through my recent submission history theres a lot of stuff there. gt I would have my greatgreatgrandfathers Victoria Cross too From the AngloEgyptian War had it not been sold at auction to some poncy Tory for  .Thats a really tough break. I obviously dont know the circumstances but I would be very sad about not having something so amazing which belonged to a relative. Do you happen to have the citation around and if so would you share it? I always love reading medal citations especially ones that old. ,wwi,cep9qe7,1,t5_2u3bf

4780041,0,t1_ctw176s,Thats an interesting caption to the poster. It also dovetails neatly with my research into Austrian tactics. It gives credence to the idea that people knew or at least had somewhat of an idea what modern war would look like prior to .
