5424246,0,t1_cw4zu5g,Please vote against this bill! Heres why you should vote against itThis bill will bring education to only one group of the many in our state. If we extend this education to the Natives and negros in our state we would greatly benefit.By including the Natives we can ease our relations with them while Americanizing them. Having them as an ally would be highly beneficial with their numbers fighting strength agricultural expertise and general knowledge of the land.If we include them and negros we would have more educated peoples who could serve our society in many ways. We could present these typically uneducated with higher level positions such as those of an agricultural society run by the negros which would still be looked over by whites at the top of the society. This would allow us to focus our own European descendant forces on more important government roles while keeping them satisfied with a sense of freedomimportance. If they decide they want these government roles it would be easier to deal with them while theyre educated rather than if they were not educated. If they are not educated and want higher level positions in society they will most likely resort to violence while if they were educated they would most likely run through peaceful petitions and protests. If they were given the chance to get an education and obtain such new positions in society they would most likely be much more willing to do the work presented to them while being educated or serving in one of these new positions. When a being is willing to do the work they are presented with they are much more effective in doing it versus if they were forced to do it and absolutely hated the work. Overall having them as educated peoples with opportunities to serve in higher positions within our society would reduce the risk of them uprisinghaving a revolt as they would probably have an uprisingrevolt on the basis of not having the chance to be educated or serve in higher positions. This greater amount of educated peoples in our workforce would give us much more manpower for jobs requiring educated peoples and so we should not pass up the opportunity to include NativesOrientals and negros.So please vote against this bill! It needs reform before it is passed!Sorry for any gramamtical mistakes I wrote this statement at  am.,HMUSGovCentral,cw5055p,1,t5_3a0w8
