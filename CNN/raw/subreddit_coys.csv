21360,0,t1_cegrrpr,Rodgers wasnt given more time than AVB his club just showed much more improvement and his superiors set more realistic expectations for him. I also think its a bit too early to say that BRs project has been a resounding success. A lot will depend on where he finishes this season. A th place finish last season was more disappointing than their fans will admit. Hes still largely relying on players that he didnt buy and though hes certainly getting the best out of them I think the extent to which hes revolutionized the club has been overstated to a cringeinducing degree. We underwent a similarly drastic transition the season BR came in but no one ever talked about it because we didnt underachieve enough to warrant excuses. Im  with Sherwood. In this era of football I think  project is a vacuous buzzword that exists only to craft an aura of gravitas around a manager. Project and Philosophy are the biggest reasons  AVB and particularly BR have reputations that vastly exceed their actual accomplishments. Its true that LFCs playstyle under BR has become more specific and refined but this atmosphere where hes framed as some Cruyyfian figure who brought split central defenders and short passing to the barbaric hoofball shores of England is preposterous. Hes a good manager IMO and honestly was my first choice when Redknapp was canned. I just think the extent to which his success is based on some transcendent philosophy or project is overblown. Hes just a solid manager who is finally getting the most out of very talented players. ,coys,cegv5dp,15,t5_2ryq7

Walker Vertonghen and Lloris could happily play in nearly any of the top six sides but Rose couldnt come anywhere near them.Hes not terribly despite todays mistake but his passing and ball control is a constant let down hes not a terribly good tackler gets caught out of position and unlike Walker doesnt often get back fast enough to cover and generally doesnt offer much going forward either despite his willingness and pace.,coys,cehiijy,4,t5_2ryq7

118355,0,t1_cerv705,I think there are parallels between AVBs and Ramoss appointments with us. Both seemed liked long term investments due to the way they came in and the funds they were given to buy lots of players in their first or nd transfer windows. It seems as if Levy wants this template of manager to be our future. Academic scientific systematic. Its no secret that he wants Spurs to have a Wenger type of manager. Ramos didnt work out because he kept on loosing. Im still not  sure about why AVB went  I think there is something behind the scenes that we as fans just wont ever find out about. I think in contrast the Redknapp and Sherwood appointments have been the temporary stop gaps. Harry worked out quite well so stayed for a bit longer. Sherwood Im still not sold on. Its impossible to tell when youre still in that honeymoon period with a manager. Long winded way of saying Im sure Levy ishas been looking for long term appointments but they havent worked out. The prem is less forgiving these days so if a manager isnt working out you need a replacement who is different. Not just a different man but a different style. ,coys,cerwpti,4,t5_2ryq7

David Marshall from Cardiff is only  and has had flashes of greatness.  Obviously not a top  keeper but serviceable and gives Archer a few years to develop.  Not sure of Stekelenburgs form of late but if Fullham get relegated  he could be a good temporary starter holy hell just checked their goal difference . nevermindThough being an American Ill be a homer and suggest Brad Guzan.

Not going for the dominant midfield focussing on possession. Without the middle three usually a mix of CapSandroPaulDem who break up play press and dispossess youre much more open. Playing like shit against teams that can score v teams that played much more cagey without him. Getting in the box playing balls through actually finishing the chances instead of shooting from outside ala Townsend and the shit shot placement v Newcastle loss. Does this person watch the games or only look at stats?gtCould a settled injury free Spurs actually be a better outfit with Adebayor in the team? How is this a question? Did this guy not watch ?

553227,0,t1_cg2kzem,gtI would like to see us move for LvG if we legitimately have a shot at himIf Louis van Gaal is available and willing we should do everything in our power to get him. His managerial record speaks for itself but for me it is his top to bottom approach that impresses me the most. LvG is a foundational manager who has set the tone for the future for all of his previous clubs. Communication and discipline are two of the most important aspects of his philosophy and for me that is exactly what Spurs need from the top to the bottom. One criticism of AVB is that he largely ignored Tim and the youth squad. Another is how he handled the Ade situation when Ade approached him privately and then before the whole squad. There clearly was not a culture of open communication at the club under AVB. This would never happen under LvG. His philosophy is not to separate and compartmentalize the club but rather to open it up and streamline it and he does so via communication. The first eleven are as important as the youth and the youth are as important as the first eleven. He tells his players that he expects them to know each others preferences and their strengths and weaknesses. Each week he opens up meetings so that players can talk and express themselves. To do that the squad must be professional enough and disciplined enough to give and receive criticism. Could the bromance culture that so many have lauded as a sign of squad strength survive such honesty? Communication is one of the keys under LvG and I think it is exceptionally important for the future successes of the club at this time of transition. Discipline is definitely something that Spurs need. It appears that once Tim was appointed one of the first things he attempted to instill into the side was discipline. That that was his first focus should tell us a great deal. Spurs needed it and needed it bad. Discipline and communication need to be consistent from the top down and Im not sure that Spurs have it at present. When AVB chose to discipline Ade for his lack of respect and for attempting to undermine his authority Levy should have supported his decision and backed him up. Levy should not have been whispering in AVBs ear Alright now Andre hasnt this punishment gone on long enough? Why isnt he in our first eleven right now? Though he has played well since returning into the squad I dislike the clear lack of a culture of discipline at Spurs that the Ade situation revealed. Heck the discipline issue goes back even to Juande Ramos days at the club. He was appalled at the lack of a culture of discipline at the club when he first arrived and attempted to remedy the situation as well. That Levy would attempt to undermine AVBs handling of a disciplinary matter clearly suggests such a lack from the top to the bottom and a lack of belief in what the manager is doing. I hear it said on here fairly regularly and it rings true every time no one player is more important than the club. LvG absolutely buys into that and frankly will not take shit from anybody. If you dont buy into his total approach both on and off the field then you are expendable. It doesnt matter if you are the best player or the worst. If he comes in and manages Spurs as I hope he does he needs to be given complete control and discretion. Levy needs to back him completely and a manager of his ilk has earned it. As I said previously LvG is a foundational manager whose philosophy both on and off the field has set the tone for all of his previous clubs. I dont care if we can get other promising managers such as De Boer for cheaper we need to do whatever it takes to get LvG to come here. Louis van Gaal is just the sort of manager that Spurs need both on and off the pitch.,coys,cg35pyo,2,t5_2ryq7

I reckon he could pop a couple in with headers too though hes not gonna outjump a centreback.OK so I guess its an attitude problem rather than a style problem with regards to the low pressing. May be indicative of our team in a way.gt He even made some dribbles when necessary and those kinds of nice things...Dont you expect a midfielder to be able to do a fair bit of dribbling rather than it being an added bonus? Im finding it hard to word my gripes with him so its not your fault for not understanding it to be honest! The point I think Im making is that when face with someone in front of him he doesnt seem to want to take them on often and will opt for a pass back to the centre back. His ability to get the ball past the opposition through dribbling and passing seems nonexistent and I kinda want reassurance that he can dribble and pass with the best of them.

If when asked about the tweet he had just said something along the lines ofI havent seen the tweet so i cant comment. I am here to talk about the match. Its simple it keeps the focus on the win and buys time.Saying something like this would have made the whole situation a moot point it would have given Sherwood a chance to see what the hell people were talking about it would have allowed media relations to get a handle on the situation it would have given him a chance to speak with Sandro directly....after doing all that he could have them commented.Instead as usual Sherwood spoke without thinking and as a result is now being quoted by every media outlet around as saying Sandro isnt good enough to play for me the media isnt going to look into the full story why bother they have been given a more interesting story by doing nothing.....it became a headline and not a footnote.Sherwood made the story because he couldnt be assed to stop and think for a second. Sherwood put himself in a position where he is going to be quoted as saying Sandro isnt good enough and risk alienating Sandro and other players.Notice how the players handle the questions thrown at them by the media?...they give dull text book answers that dont create stories. When the players deal with the media better than the manager there is an issue.He consistently makes regrettable comments in the media he consistently makes self serving comments in the media he consistently makes negative comments about the squad in the media.....Sherwood may not be an idiot...but he is flippant and shortsighted which can be just as damaging.,coys,cgx0wp4,3,t5_2ryq7

1248429,0,t1_ci9r5yc,IF England are to accomplish anything at the World Cup they must come together as a band of brothers.The heartache of the last decade has seen the majority of England fans write off their teams chances this summer.It is understandable considering recent failures but it is also wrong.England DO have a chance of going all the way. I know their quality from playing against their stars in the Premier League.But it all depends on whether Roy Hodgsons boys can come together as a team.Max People talk about how Englands players have struggled to cope under the pressure in recent years. Pressure? Try playing for Brazil!The expectation is cranked up to the max on our players yet we have still managed to win the World Cup five times  and the reason is we play as a team.We are never a group of individuals and that is what England must strive to achieve.Unless you have everybody fighting for the cause it does not matter  you will not win.Englands squad need to be best friends to come together as a family. If one of them is struggling they need to help each other out. If they can do that they have as good a chance as anyone because no one who has played against their stars at club level is in any doubt over how good they can be.My country Brazil are one of the favourites  and rightly so considering our glittering history plus we are the hosts.But I do not see too many differences between our Samba boys and Englands men in white. Every player in their squad barring Celtics Fraser Forster plays in the best league in the world  the Premier League.And the majority of them also regularly play at the highest club level in the Champions League.So they have to be taken seriously  only a fool would write them off.If I had to pick four standout players they would be Steven Gerrard Wayne Rooney Gary Cahill and Leighton Baines.Ive faced all of them on a number of occasions with Tottenham.Roy Hodgson is blessed with some of the best in the world in those positions.Rooney and Gerrard are obvious choices of course  they have been at the top of the sport for a decade now.Crucial And while some may be more surprised to see me pick Cahill and Baines those who have played the game would not be.Cahill is so strong and such a tough opponent to play against while Baines is a constant threat down the left armed with a superb delivery from crosses and setpieces.What will be crucial though is whether they can come together and play for each other.As we say in Brazil A uniao faz a forca  Our union makes us stronger.,coys,cia2b6a,9,t5_2ryq7

1664652,0,t1_cjoxpub,This is a great explanation. Id like to add a few things. His style is focused on attacking. Hence the the high pressure winning ball back early is to fuel the attack and create counters and more scoring opportunities. Another thing to note is the importance of the CDM. He sees it as the link between defense and offense and is crucial in starting the attacks. Once the ball is won back in our defensive half the CDM needs to find an outlet pass to stretch the ball out wide or to catch the opponents defense unprepared. The CDM needs to be a great ball winner as well as a great distributor. Schneiderlein excelled under Poch last season and Capoue could be the man this year.,coys,cjozow3,9,t5_2ryq7

1928120,0,t1_cklil9s,Positioning specifically Chadli Ade and the fullbacks is massively important to the system. One of the things Ive started noticing is just why Lamelas drifting out to the left wing because Chadli or Ade are in need of service from that area and Dier is already pushing high up. Hes been my favorite buy of the summer so far. The strength and weakness in the system is just how high risk it is. When you split the two centerbacks and push the defensive mid back to form a crude back three the press in the final third has to be intense. From the Sunderland QPR and West Ham matches and even in flashes against Liverpool were showing a lot more urgency already so the attack can only improve. Im watching the Dortmund game against Arsenal and thats the way a proper press is done. Arsenals defense just couldnt cope with the pace of Auba and Immobile and though we dont really have any players in the same mold of those two we can definitely learn from their unit pressing. ,coys,ckliw21,3,t5_2ryq7

2224333,0,t3_2klqln,Very good point about no one hitting the channels. As mentioned all the best attacking teams do this. And we have a player who can do it in Dembele. A one two on the edge of the box with Ade would open up and get in behind a lot of defences with ease because of his pace and strength. Mason can do this as he has enough energy to do so too. Both can make untracked runs from deep. Also the Lamela point is so spot on. For now I think we should stick with an orthodox winger staying wide and hitting the byline. Particularly on the right whilst Walker is out. Even though Lennons crossing isnt fantastic if he hugs the touchline like he used to knocking it past the full back on the half turn receiving the ball and darting to the byline whipping or drilling a cross after getting behind the oppositions defence Ade and a drifting Chadli  Eriksen can have opportunities to score. ,coys,clmkeay,3,t5_2ryq7

Newcastle is in great form right now but as soon as their current form drops itll be back to a few points here and here. Look at the top clubs in the league even Chelsea struggle at times yesterday against QPfuckingR for gods sake but they still manage to get the three points when they should. So what if we played Villa today and up a man? We were away from home and down a goal early and we got all three points. That is a positive no matter who you play in the league.

2936182,0,t1_co1t96b,It wasnt even one of those games where everyone after the game is saying he was shit for both teams. It was one of the most onesided performances I have ever seen from an officiating crew. One of their goals was blatant hand ball Shawcross elbowed a ball off the line at one point and dragged Kaboul down in the box while defending a corner at another we had a goal that was a full two yards onside ruled out for offside and we had a player sent off for basically nothing. Thats just the big mistakes. I also remember several corners  throws  goalkicks that were given the wrong way in favor of Stoke I remember Stoke having a different set of rules as far as fouling was concerned. I almost never talk about referees after a match because I think in most circumstances a team can put themselves in a position where a game isnt decided by poor calls but this game was just insane. It was also frustrating because that was one of those rare matches where Redknapp changed the system at half time and completely turned the game around. I distinctly remember Bassong and JD coming on and getting downvoted for correctly pointing out wed switched to three at the back as if no one could believe Redknapp would do something that drastic. We were absolutely brilliant in that second half and should have won the match. ,coys,co1uuay,10,t5_2ryq7

3008057,0,t1_co9reuw,I wholeheartedly disagree with your premise. Weve seen him get plenty of shouts as cam or at least the most forward of a midfield  and never does he look a danger to crack a shot or making a darting run into the box. He just doesnt have the killer goal instinct and this story makes perfect sense.  Its not just that hed use basketball goal stands as goals there were no goals. Hed just get to the end of the court and place the ball. As much as you can sweep that under the rug as just a quirky old story I do think how you play in your youth stays with you throughout your life.  I have a friend on my  a side team who always scores off the posts and I never understood how he became so good at that.  Then one day he showed us a game he used to play in Brazil where one of the main objects is to score off the post and it all made sense. ,coys,co9s6o6,-2,t5_2ryq7

Hes instilled a culture in the locker room that you will have a chance and if you dont work your ass off and follow my shit you will not play. If you dont play like everyone else and play like a team you will not play. There was an ITK that came out a while ago and i think it was after the west brom defeat how quickly sentiment can change And basically gave them an absilute rollicking. He said that he came here to fucking win and people who dont want to work and follow his coach will be frozen out like benny or sold. Brilliant. Another thing i like about poch is that everyone has had their shot. Its not like AVB or sherwood where players were just not playing because of egos or other non performance based stuff. If you dont perform you dont play. He dropped adebayor and his own captain kaboul. Hes not afraid to do what he wants for the whole of the team and group mentality. ,coys,cof4wso,4,t5_2ryq7

That situation is a professional foul.In this case Dembele had beaten Sakho already. The goalscoring chance was coming. As you yourself said it was to prevent an opportunity on goal. Another way to say that is a foul to deny a clear goalscoring opportunity. Which  if I recall correctly is a red card.,coys,cohu8q3,-12,t5_2ryq7

Stay positive keep them motivated of course keep focusgood luck with Us! get good behavior but everything can be done in coaching without being negative. And let them think create and play as much as possible dont dictate how they should be doing things guide them.And avoid lines and drills like the black death keep everyone involved high repetition of game situations if it doesnt look like part of the full game dont be doing it. A player doesnt play against cones and sticks he plays against players. Intelligence and freedom of decision are crushed too often at youth level let them play let them love the game.And good luck with the parents.,coys,col0bww,8,t5_2ryq7

3390046,0,t1_cpei68c,Its very exciting in its own way and very differently paced.  Womens sports in every way are underattended mostly I think because of certain ingrained societal biases about whats appropriate for masculine or feminine environments sports often involve aggressive contact antagonism force etc which go against expected gender norms for women so folks are less inclined to be interested.  The one exception may be the gymnastic summer and winter Olympic sports like rhythmic bars ice skating etc because those play into stereotypically feminine aspects like grace or beauty.In addition I find its more difficult for me to get invested in womens soccer on a team level because of lack of knowledge about players and because of difficulty of access small stadiums inconveniently located.  The national team US is better because those women are successful and Americans love to watch and celebrate a success.  So following individual players is I think more common Im a huge fan of Megan Rapinoe for example but I know next to nothing about the Seattle Reign the league team she plays for or about the Washington Spirit the league team that plays in DC where I live.Ultimately I think its just going to take time.  As people become less invested in any sort of presupposed expectation of what soccer e.g. should be about and how menwomen should behave womens soccer will normalize.  Its already got foundations as a popular way for girls to play roughly on par with boys  at a young age physical differences are essentially irrelevant to quality of play  and as a nowdecadesold popular sport for girls in its own right at least in America.  In another generation or two I think womens soccer could be legitimately popular.,coys,cpeoxbi,5,t5_2ryq7

Once you saw that they were playing  at the back you knew we were outnumbered in the midfield but Poch stuck with it. Even when he put Dembele on and we couldve gone to a  we stuck with the same system!If you look at this tactical preview they did virtually everything discussed there but it wasnt until the second half that we managed to deal with it. And even then United werent attacking anywhere near as much. Once again however we see that we cannot affect a game with our substitutions. None of them offered anything.

Either way and as with Soldado its not our problem. They have not produced for us. Weve waited and waited but for the most part Soldados inclusion in the lineup has been a waste of a shirt despite some good linkup play.I watched a lot of Lamela in Italy and the thing that strikes me is the weakness of the Italian game  the fact the game is played at a walking pace and defenders stand off it allows players to do their tricks and change pace quickly.  lollipops a burst of speed and your man just watches you glide past. He will never get that time and space in the Premier League and his efforts to adapt have shown barely any fruit.There has to come a time where it is clearly not working out for club nor player and everyone cuts their losses. I hear people every home game saying how talented Lamela is but to your English fan who didnt see him play for Roma this seems made up in their own head probably because he looks a bit like Ronaldo.

3661928,0,t1_cq9mwht,Pace isnt really the issue its his communication and the fact we dont have a partnership which is vital at CB. Its pretty understandable really he was the most experienced CB playing in a team hes hardly played for with a partner hes hardly played with in a league he hasnt played in much at all. The fact of the matter is that hes much better than the average fourth choice CB for a club which probably wont even get sixth. I dont see what is hard to grasp about that. I think its very unfair to judge him yet really considering how much time weve given Soldado Lamela etc to settle. Give the guy a break we got a really experienced CB who has been very successful in Europe for a cheap sum of money and he seems okay to not be first choice. Thats above average for a squad player for a club of our stature. Edit Also people seem to gloss over the fact that Fazio was instrumental in probably our best game of the season against Chelsea.

4604008,1,t3_3e2sou,Alderweireld should bring a noticeable benefit to the team for the first time in ages well have a legitimately quality centreback pairing but also his presence should give Vertonghen a boost as theyve played together in the past.Dier was a great signing and will really come into fruition within a few years. Davies provided much needed depth for the LB role he is a very necessary player.With Freidel resigning and Lloris recently getting an injury. its quite obvious why we signed Vorm.Yedlin amp Dele Ali are your classic Spurs low risk signings even if they dont work out well sell them at profit.Fazio was always a poor signing I dont know why people were excited about a slow centreback with attitude problems but when I pointed this out I got downvoted. He was gambled to be just as good as Musacchio he wasnt.Stambouli just didnt make sense at all.Whilst its true our starting XI hasnt changed much  you have to bear in mind that outside of the CM role and arguably the right wing our squad is very very good. A high quality CM to go alongside Bentaleb legitimately feels like the last piece of the puzzle.,coys,ctax6zw,2,t5_2ryq7

4848997,0,t1_cu5qmi5,There is probably a very good reason why Capoue wasnt even near the first team for months just like Adebayor Kaboul and Lennon. And I would think PSG can afford to waste money on a player who will probably play in League  and cup games when the bigger names are rested for important matches. He was able to play on that level before but he showed very little when he played for us. Sandro is injury prone that was even more obvious after he signed for QPR.Its completely pointless to moan about players who used to play for us. But I agree with you we should have signed at least one player who can play at CMCDM by now.

They have given a fairly good run again against other teams in the title race. We usually flop.

4878943,0,t1_cu9elzx,Hm statistically he looks nothing special. Pretty average shooting and goalscoring rate. Few dribbles few key passes. And all in a lower quality league than the Prem. I wonder what they see in him that wouldnt show up in the numbers.edit actually comparing him to Berahino similar goals per  minutes in the past two seasons Bera is .. Koko is .. similar shots per minute .. vs .. similar accuracy  vs  Berahino is better at dribbling though neither of them take people on a ton and Kokorin is better in the airAnd a weird stat that I happened across he gets fouled a lot. Like just a touch under Hazard levels. Thats odd because he doesnt try and dribble at people much and when he does its not very effective. Who knows where that comes from then.To be fair these are all just stats and I havent seen him play at all so I cant make too many conclusions. Kokorin has okay shooting numbers on a th place team in the Russian league. Berahino posted similar numbers picking up scraps in a bottomhalf team in England. Kokorins probably less than half Berahinos price. Im not really sure what any of this means.,coys,cu9j1dc,5,t5_2ryq7

Hell if you need to work two jobs. Your family will understand that you need to work and you can save up to maybe head back to the UK if you needed to.

They also have Aguero who is doing his best to keep the memory of Suarezs biannual feasts of Norwich alive by doing a particularly good homage with us regularly.To your point however I think drawing against City  which is probably something more feasible with our rested Belgian backs  would be a great coup for a club that in the past has capitulated more goals to the PL elites than almost any other nonrelegation club.,coys,cvcrqxn,5,t5_2ryq7

But it is not as if someone would choke on their beverage either if someone in England laid down some super antiSemitic sentiment during supper.Winston Churchil at the time considered a friend of Jewish people for instance penned an oped piece where he claimedgtThe central fact which dominates the relations of Jew and nonJew is that the Jew is different. He looks different. He thinks differently. He has a different tradition and background. He refuses to be absorbed.But lets use a different example too The history of the word Yid and Spurs. North London and Tottenham in particular has for a long time been a welcome home to migrants. Before the war lots of labor migrants from CentralEurope made it to North London in search of employment. Even though most of them were not Jews the word Yid became a lazy slur for lots of folks. So people would call any migrant in North London a Yid regardless if they were Prussian Check Protestant etc. Fortunately fans of Spurs devloped the slur to celebrate the fact that TottenhamNorth London was accepting of migrants and turned it into something positive.,coys,cyopkf1,2,t5_2ryq7

While Bale was winning us games on his own Adebayor was making us a man team in the  games he appeared in.Finally he turned up for two of the last three games Chelsea and Stoke and made an effort but he was absolutely nowhere for the rest of the season.Had he put in that sort of effort for even ONE of the nine draws we got we could have score two more points finished fourth possibly kept Bale possibly got Wenger the sack... etc. At the very least the m would have attracted better than the likes of Chiriches Capoue Paulinho Soldado sorry Bobby.If buts and maybes but one things for sure I have never seen a lessinterested professional before or since and it cost us hugely.,coys,cz3yim5,33,t5_2ryq7

I think  works well at the moment and it means the manager has to actually manager the players and the tactics closely prior to the game and then in game is faced with greater challenges. Just because you have a squad of  players doesnt mean you should automatically be able to use any of them any game day and in doing so you make it easier and take away an element of management. Picking yours starting  and  players as backups should leave enough options to pick tactics and be able to alter sufficiently or make changes with injuries. You can still only make  subs so why have even more to choose from?I see his point that by not making the selection it might send the wrong message to his squad but thats his job to make sure they fully understand his plans. It shouldnt lead to discord as a result. ,coys,cz6ee5i,8,t5_2ryq7

6339943,0,t1_cz9xkcv,I agree about Alli but I think the only reason hes playing higher up is to accommodate Dembele while hes in such great form. I actually have a hard time picking a starting  at the moment. My first instinct is to play Harry up top with Son Eriksen and Lamela in behind. Alli and Dier running the midfield but then theres no room for Dembele and while Ive never been his biggest fan theres no arguing that hes been great this season.You could swap Dembele and Dier in that situation but the thing I like about Eric is that hes a defender first he can drop back and play that rd CB role while the fullbacks push right up. Im not sold on Dembele doing that and I think it would be a waste of his skills. You could also argue that Chadli deserves a starting spot out wide. I mean hes not a flashy player but when hes been fit hes done nothing but score goals.,coys,czaa4oe,3,t5_2ryq7

6361173,0,t3_42s9uu,Well itll definitely make things interesting.  Ill watch a few Palace matches.I have weird feelings about Ade.  He did a job at Spurs on loan and then again under Sherwood.  I think he ran into issues when we had managers that were very very demanding AVB and Poch.  He strikes me as just an absolutely natural athlete who grew up playing football with no thoughts towards being a millionaire unlike Academy kids who know from age  that they could be on a path to a lucrative career.  I dont think hes ever lost that attitude.  He just wants to play and score goals.  And then go home and spend money like a  year old who won the lottery.,coys,czcp0m6,1,t5_2ryq7
6362094,0,t3_42s9uu,Perfect timing for this signing as Im sure the universe would have arranged for him to bang one in on us were he in the squad during that last game.More importantly though I hope Ade starts tearing it up wanting to impress with a brandnew contract underway. The remainder of this season has Palace playing Liverpool United Leicester West Ham and Arsenal.

And I think its a little more nuanced than did he deliberately handle it or deliberately not avoid handling it. Its more did he deliberately handle it or did he deliberately stick his arm out in an unnatural position and did his deliberate arm motion result in a handball. I dont think he has to intend or recklessly fail to avoid handling itI think its enough if he intentionally sticks his arm out regardless of whether he even knew the ball was coming toward his arm and the end result is the ball strikes his arm.Its still a bit of a harsh penalty because its questionable whether he deliberately stuck his arm away from his body.

6897874,0,t1_d0y6lbl,Sure but that doesnt mean that the clubs with the most money will do the best for a player. For a guy like Mahrez hes not a nailed on starter for City probably more of a rotation option depending on how he performs and their other signings. Come to Spurs and hes a key player.Thats not to say that he will or should come to Spurs but that for a player it may not be as simple as picking the best team most likely to win titles. The closer you get to the top teams the trickier it can be for a players career. Scott Sinclair is the most glaring example of it but there are plenty of players who make a big step up and regret it.That said were probably better off not going after a guy like Mahrez who is at peak value right now. That is we are much less able to pay for actual quality than potential quality ie we sign Eriksen at  instead of Ozil Clinton instead of Di MariaDepay etc. A player like Mahrez has more downside in terms of value not to be confused with quality than upside. Given our financial constraints buying potential is better value for money than actual ability.,coys,d0y6xq3,3,t5_2ryq7

Maybe all teams fans think like this. But it does definitely seem like were not quite making the most of our opportunities. ,coys,d1pahs9,7,t5_2ryq7
7148067,0,t1_d1qgyg2,Still fun to speculate though. I still think Berahinos a good fit. Or Batshuayi. Witsel would be a good fit to rotate with into the double pivot. Honestly we just need more goals from the other members of our attack. They seem to be almost too selfless in the box dishing it to Kane or someone else when they should take the shot. Maybe thats just Poch instructing them to feed it to Kane though. Son in particular seems to take just half a second too long to decide what to do resulting in an intercepted pass or a blocked shot. If he fixes that and his often frantic first touch hell be fantastic. Dudes deadly with both feet.,coys,d1qntz3,3,t5_2ryq7
7163869,0,t3_4dlt5k,Same advice to Ledley as to any aspiring English coach  do what no English coach ever does and get abroad immediately.  Not to manage a club just go and get a job with any decent Spanish German Italian club.  Or start at a notsodecent club swallow your pride and just go and learn because you cannot become a top coach without leaving the UK anymore.  Be involved in the youth setup preferably.  Learn a language.  Settle down somewhere new for a few years.    Learn a different focus on technique and tactical awareness.  Theres a reason why English managers dont succeed at the top  they never go to  learn from the managers who do.Then come home and dont start at a big management job first.  ,coys,d1sgowj,13,t5_2ryq7

They have plenty of creativity with Coutinho and Firmino. However if Sturridge continues to get injured every season that will be a big blow for them. If they can stay healthy and improve their defense and maybe add a defensive mid as well they could challenge but we can only wait and see now. ,coys,d2ufac5,10,t5_2ryq7

Hes the th highest goal scorer despite that. Only behind the two best strikers in the league and an over performing racist chav. Who is the striker for the league champions. I know things like this are all just pure speculation but having a few more international colleagues around might help with motivationbedding in. There is no denying the lad is a huge talent and is still young. If he is available we would be mad to not have him under consideration.

7884907,0,t1_d42a1ep,I agree I want to keep him too like I said. His positional flexibility alone should warrant keeping him if only for a depth option. What really cost Chadli his spot is the rise of Dele Alli. Before that it was Lamela  Chadli on the wings and Eriksen in the middle. Eriksen has to start and Alli does too now but Alli is pretty much only a middle of the field player so we have to bump Eriksen out wide. That left Lamela on the other wing and I think we all agree he should still be there next year which puts Chadli on the bench.I want to keep him too. I think hes a great depth option.

8520630,0,t3_4wfe3w,Always enjoy your analysis and your predictions are often sensible.A couple thoughts Pep I dont think hes as supernatural as some say. He gets the biggest teams to work with. Last season was a bit telling. He had arguably the best team in the world and didnt take the CL didnt even get close. And Jose is mercurial. Things are going his way right now but when they dont he gets really passiveaggressive which doesnt always get results. I get the management of expectations. But I do want to believe in us taking a shot at the PL. A big part of being a supporter to me is hoping for eventual success. I expect our squad to always have the summit in their sites  isnt this what motivates them to perform?Some questions given your predictions. You predict advancement in FA and League with modest performance in CL. That implies that we wont adjust our focus to only one or two achievements. Do you think we have the depth and quality to chase multiple achievements?  How do you think this will affect our performance in early spring It may have been our efforts in FA and EL that stymied our title run?. Whats your pragmatic prediction of our injury table? Do you think we will lose valuable contributions from Kane and Dembl due to injury? Who else looks liable for a couple of months of injury?. Teams like West Ham and Southampton appeared threatening last season and could rob points from the top of the table. Do you think their performance this season is more likely to help us or hurt us?Also fuck Woolwich. We should start a decadelong winning streak against them just to keep them bent.EDIT removed nonapplicable lingo,coys,d66n1ax,5,t5_2ryq7

I agree with you on most things but not here as the selfproclaimed mouth of Tottenham you have a certain responsibility  this is serious. In what world are Coutinho and Wijnaldum better players than Eriksen come on man for fucks sake. I dont think you realise just how irreplaceable Eriksen actually is to us. I know it feels like hes a lot older with his receding hairline but he is still  and a fair few seasons away from reaching his supposed prime. Whenever Eriksen has a few bad games everyone just seem to overreact massively I dont know why  I think people expect him to be something which he isnt and they get caught up in that.

8793119,1,t3_50kbaf,Im supper happy with him coming in. I wanted to know if there was any statistical backup to peoples opinion of him and there doest seem to be.He scored an average rating of . from Whoscored last season. higher than Wanyama who we were ecstatic to get and higher than Wijnaldum who wed have been ecstatic to get. He rated higher than our own Davies and Wimmer and higher than Defoe who had a CRACKING season for Sunderland.. only puts him in the top  players of last season statistically and he does have a reputation for playing up for big games but he seems to make significant contributions to the teams hes in.Besides he was achieving all this in a pretty mediocre Newcastle side with no cohesion anywhere on the park so I for one think hell flourish in a Poch team.,coys,d74tb43,2,t5_2ryq7
8793711,0,t1_d74uyu8,Agreed completely on the first point I also dont understand why this wasnt wrapped up sooner but for whatever reason it wasnt. what i meant was on deadline day and faced with either buying sissoko for  million or buying no one its just a no brainer to me. as big of a risk as he is not buying him would have been an even bigger risk a potentially suicidal one for our top  hopes.  so when i think of the alternative of not having him I feel extremely relieved that we do have him as our th choice CM.I probably am being a bit unfair. I love winks i think hell turn into a great player in a few years. but he is untested both in the Prem and in the CL. hes also inexperienced. And carroll is simply not even in the same realm as a dembele so we dont need to get into that. Hed be a great  as his passing is exquisite but he doesnt have the physicality and drive needed for a Moussa replacement. i dont mean that sissoko would be a better  choice than those two if he just took a day off completely. i mean i would rather sissoko with his pace and physicality and drive at even  effort play instead of those two at  especially against the likes of Chelsea or Utd whose midfielders would steamroll carroll and winks despite their best efforts. its a controversial opinion i know but hopefully sissoko will be giving  every match and win us a few games in the process. ,coys,d74vved,1,t5_2ryq7

As for the defence it was just seriously sloppy I think we had such a strong start the defence may have got complacent. Finally I think we all got a high off slapping Stoke  but this is a Stoke team who has looked very poor since this season has kicked off  games admittedly. However only  game out of  I still think we can top this group so fuck it COYS!!!!!!!!!! Any mistakes well I drank a lot of beer during the game.TLDR Great forward play problem we have no forwards,coys,d7mxrls,2,t5_2ryq7

Aound midnight I saw the writing on the wall and said lets get out of here. She said she had to go back to the lab after but I could come if I wanted. Her project for the past few years has been reengineering Tcells to attack bloodborne cancer cells. Theyve  succeeded but there has been adverse inflammation effects that has been fatal. So now they are trying to engineer around the inflammation issue.  So my response was Fuck yes!. Got to the lab she pulled out a live lung cancer culture that I looked at under the microscope they had a D printer in there that I geeked out on and then we started drinking whiskey in her office and watched Trump become president. So basically Tuesday I watched Trump become president in the lab on the cutting edge of Cancer research at Yale. So it was a real Yin  Yang kind of night. ,coys,d9vw34s,35,t5_2ryq7

I do not advocate that he should play on the flanks but he fits nicely in a system like the one used in this match where the width comes from the full backs.But I guess we disagree on the pecking order thing which is only nice.

9728968,0,t1_daca0pu,Well its an issue of money and prestige.Realistically we are not going to win the champions league we also do not have the quality throughout our squad to be able to field a strong enough team to be confident of progressing further in the CL and still be able to field a strong team in the league  days later.So Poch has to make a decision do we weaken the CL team or the PL team.If we play a weakened PL team to focus on CL we are greatly reducing our chances of getting near the title or even top . This means next year we would likely be in the Europa League we will focus on the league and sacrifice europe again but without the added benefit of CL money and the attractiveness of being a CL club to bring in players.If we Weaken the CL team weak give ourselves a much better chance in the league with last year showing we are not too far away but we have to suffer the embarrassment of going out the way we have.As a long term strategy being seen as a club that consistently qualifies for the champions league is vital it will be far easier to attract top level players and the additional revenue will allow us to increase the wages that Levy is willing to pay this in turn should allow us to develop much greater quality and depth across the squad so that we are eventually able to compete across all competitions.Do we as fans have to like it? No. But from a purely pragmatic point of view it is what makes the most sense with the current state of the club.,coys,dacb3oo,21,t5_2ryq7

He is going to take Europa seriously and rotate some but not all and not enough. Our players always get dog ass tired in the tail end of the season. I would prefer to see us finish a season extremely strong and with high energy. I am sick of the wasted energy in Europa. We never get close to winning the damn thing anyways. Scrap the competition and put all of our chips in finishing in the top  challenging for a title again. If he were to absolutely  guarantee that he will not start play Kane Lloris Alderwerield Vertonghen Rose Walker Dembele Wanyama Eriksen Alli Lamela Son or Dier in Europa league then I would say okay Pochettino I am all for us playing in Europa.

Absolutely deserved the loss. Rojo bossed Harry sad to say. Someone has got to be brought in to teach that boy some balance. Sometimes his little ambling turns are good for getting past defenders. But they also give up goals like the bullshit goal we conceded. I wish Dier had been in for Wanyama. Though Vic was better with the ball at his feet than in the past he doesnt have Diers eye or his goalscoring ability. Winks had some decent passes though. I dont necessarily understand why he was brought on for Moussa when the moose looked like one of our only attacking players who gave a shit. Didnt care for Eriksen being taken off either. Alli did jack shit all match and got to stay on but Eriksen who let us remember has scored a bakers fucking dozen late goals for us and has actually hit the target multiple times during the match needs to come off.

Does Poch force Kyle and Danny to complete   yard passes on the ground before he allows them a drink of water?  Also  wouldnt mind Sissoko playing a little deeper in the midfield when Lamela comes back. He has an antipress ability similar to Dembele. Right when I think there is no where to go he just bullies his way out. Hugo makes saves that I need to wait for slow motion replay to even see. So by that logic he has superpowers. He is no normal man. I feel us starting to find our feet.  Working out kinks in the next two weeks could have us ready to thump Chelsea at the lane.

If not then Burke Sandro ramirez Werner.  Dembele will be  so try and get another young centre mid wont happen but keita from Leipzig or maybe paredes from Roma tielemans from Anderlecht Probably sell the loanees Also depends if dier will be used regularly as a CB maybe another defensive midfielder to cover big Vic as  he cant play every game and unfortunately could get injured. Dendoncker maybe.,coys,ddd9gvn,18,t5_2ryq7
10639780,0,t3_5s8zje,Definitely another center mid. Moose is close to  now and he wont be in peak fitness which leaves us only with Winksy. If we dont want to go too defensive or have Sisso play at midfield we will need a good player there.

10647011,0,t3_5s8zje,Ideally two quality players Attacker who can both cover for Kane play next to Kane for parts of the match or cover one of the attacking midfield positions. Easy to find I know. But someone not too dissimilar in style from Sanchez or Rashford wouldnt be too bad. Id accept Griezmann Levy... New CB.I also want us to sign a few teenagers promising players. We have a good academy but in several positions were short of options in the  year bracket. Strikers left backs whore young but could be options for easier cup matches etc. ,coys,dde5o9v,2,t5_2ryq7

10727848,0,t3_5tgwej,We didnt lose because Vertonghen and Rose were out that reason is weak and so was the reason Poch gave us after the game. We lost because he failed to adapt to this specific team. We knew what Liverpool wanted to do because of how they played us at WHL and all season and we knew we were not good at playing against what Liverpool do best pressing because in most of our defeats that tactic has been the main factor. Most fans will want to brush this loss aside but to me it ranks very highly in our losses under Poch just because of the sheer naivety Poch showed in this game. Luckily unless we go far in the europa league we wont have to face a top  team away from home due to our premier league schedule. ,coys,ddmhx1e,1,t5_2ryq7

11053605,0,t3_5xu8mz,Great game all round. As much slating as there gas been for Robles he really kept them in the game with a number of good saves. Yes he basically gifted us two goals but he also kept about  perfect chances out of net. Says a lot about our defense that it took the other best striker in the league a completely anomaly mishap for him to score. The second was bad the defense just completely shut off they had a messy line that kept players onside and we were punished. Thankfully those lapses come rarely. I thought Davies took a few steps up yesterday but his passing and some defensive play was questionable. Jes growing back into the team but it is a bit disappointing that it took him about  games to finally get to speed. I just want Vertonghen to get a goal at the end of those crazy runs. Dembele needs to improve his passing because his dribbling gets way too overcomplicated at times and he ends up losing the ball too often. He just needs to get better at passing through the channels. ,coys,dekwoau,9,t5_2ryq7

11346930,0,t1_dfhmyie,Theres no contradiction. I said stats are misleading didnt I? I never said disregard stats? My point is you have to investigate stats instead of taking something you see on a side bar to feel validated. I notice you gleaned over the Dembele riddle that you randomly threw in? Take him for example. Dembele has the rd or th most successful take ons of a midfieler behind Hazard and Mane I believe and as it turns out our highest pass completion rateI was correct. Yet he has very few assists  I believe and no goals. What does this tell you? Straight away youd think hes not creative cant pick a good pass and cant finish. Thats what you deduce from stats alone. Yet I feel and many others I believe that Dembele is our best player. Hes vital. The most important cog in the team and without him theres a complete disconnect between defence and attack. Hes regularly the player who draws in two or three players and plays the pass before the assist. But stats dont tell you that do they? Watching games does. On Lamela. I often see the chances created from last year statistic. Lamela took all corners last year. Any semi successful corner is considered a chance created. Look deeper and find how many we actually scored from? Very few. And deeper again. How many assists had Lamela from play. Then he looks a long way off Dele or Eriksen. Im not saying disregard stats. Theres definitely a place for data analytics in football. My point is to understand statistics before basing an argument around them. ,coys,dfi5k7w,3,t5_2ryq7
