67366,0,t1_celx2su,I work in the same area I recommend skewing your working hours if at all possible.  The traffic leaving Harvester from  is very frusterating.  Downtown Burlington has a few different pubbars for different types.  There are appartments at Guelph and New that has a grassy area in the middle that would work for your dog but there are also a fair amount of park areas and paths if you dont get a yard.edit spelling,BurlingtonON,cem3lb2,1,t5_2rlw8

7230522,0,t3_4eevl0,My wife and I were just talking about the concern we have with so many shops closing up downtown recently.  We were walking through and could count a few. The furniture store on Brant is having a clear out as it is moving. Also the old Rude Native restaurant has been closed up for a year now.  Even the second cup at the corner of Brant and Lakeshore is now closed. I know there are a few others that have escaped me but it can be concerning if the businesses arent replaced with worth while attractions shopsrestaurantsetc.,BurlingtonON,d20220e,2,t5_2rlw8

10011051,0,t1_dbcgt9p,Honestly it is a scam to pay them when you can go to a site like BC Bud Store High Grade Aid or Cannabismo and get better weed than most dispensaries will sell for cheaper. I just dont like having to wait  days for shipping all the time and like to be able to stop by a store front at moments notice.,BurlingtonON,dbcgvx8,1,t5_2rlw8

11108957,0,t1_der1vz9,Using the holocaust as a similar experience is hugely offensive. Pigs are bred for consumption...humans not so much. I can see why people have commented that these groups are delusional. This is an example that they clearly are. ,BurlingtonON,der6vf1,7,t5_2rlw8
