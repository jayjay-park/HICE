3310897,0,t3_2xmtnl,I think you need to select them all and set their Album Artist to something like Various Artists this is more important than setting the album as compilation. The individual artists would be in the Artist field. And then in view options theres a setting I think that says Use Album Artists. With that on there will be only one artist added to your library now Various Artists instead of the many and youd still retain those artist names as well. ,ITunes,cp5o4j1,2,t5_2r0em

5661497,0,t1_cwycv25,While it would be very labor intensive Id be glad to go through it. But what I want is that old ID removed from their records completely so this doesnt continue to happen in the future. Otherwise all that work is for nothing because theyve started in a very random fashion to have music Ive purchased over a decade after the old ID was obsolete linked to it.Im going to make an appointment at the Apple Store to talk to one of their people to see if there is anything I can do about that.,ITunes,cwyv36q,1,t5_2r0em

7546972,0,t1_d2zlkzb,howdy wildtap         if they are both checked then you can PROBABLY delete the original. proly ... grin         since this is apple itunes we are talking about  and its a giant snafu these days  i strongly recommend you pick a few songs in itunes and use the show in finderexplorer option to see the location of the tracks that itunes is actually using. that otta show that the original files are NOT being used by itunes and are safe to delete.        plus if you are feeling a bit beltANDsuspendersish you can MOVE the original files instead of deleting them. that might be a good idea simply for the sake of having a backup.        there are few things as appalling as starting up your system one day and finding that all your music has vanished. itunes DOES that sometimes. sigh ...         take care    lee    ,ITunes,d301yiy,1,t5_2r0em
7652325,0,t1_d3bumm7,howdy insertamusingname         no can do i think. sigh ...         the artist view does NOT allow you to add or remove columns so you cant add date added. plus the viewsortalbumsby menu item does NOT include date added. it only has ...    title     genre     year     rating        if you are very consistent about rating your tracks then that might kindasorta work for you. the new tracks would not be rated yet.       aside  the artist view on my system is SLOW to come up. songs view comes up right quick but artist view takes several seconds. long enuf that i wonder if itunes is hung again.     as usual you can go to the itunes feedback site helpprovideitunesfeedback and let them know what you want. they will  of course  ignore you since you are just another ignorant unsophisticated peasant like everyone not employed by apple as a UI designer.        i finally am testing out foobar and musicbee. they both seem pretty nifty. musicbee is much prettier but i cant figure out how to find out what folders are in what libraries. blush gonna hafta post to their forum and ask ... oh the horrors! grin         take care    lee    ,ITunes,d3c0z2s,0,t5_2r0em
