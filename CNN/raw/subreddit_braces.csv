490826,0,t3_1zqlqo,The bread should not have broken the bracket off if they cured the adhesive properly. Definitely they should be fixing that no problem and also placing the ligature around that front bracket that is missing one.Regarding the teeth contact your bite will change MANY times throughout the process of orthodontic treatment. Even from day to day teeth that made no contact will touch and ones that touched will suddenly not touch at all. Dont worry this is totally normal.,braces,cfw26ii,1,t5_2rqo4
597649,0,t3_20qex0,My dentist does my orthodontics as well. He has a plan to fix many many issues including multiple fillings well he wants to rip out some cracked fillings and repair a possible root canal and a crown or three. He presented me two options fix everything now and just skip braces or do braces first THEN fix everything. The reason to get the braces before doing any repairs is that the braces changed my bite and how the teeth touch so much it would be pointless to make repairs first they would need to be redone or at least adjusted once all my teeth move. My guess would be as long as the rootsbone are fine you are fine to get braces on. They may want to fix any big active cavities but I dont imagine it would put off braces more than a few months. They will get on you about a need to be vigilant brushing and flossing because even people with perfectly healthy teeth will often get a cavity or two while in braces because food can get between teeth or under brackets and the longer it sits on the tooth the more the opportunity for decay.,braces,cg87frk,2,t5_2rqo4

4654001,0,t3_3epnjo,It usually takes a couple weeks in order for your tongue and mouth to get used to all the new stuff in there.  I compare it to getting a new pair of shoes and walking around NYC.  If you did that you would get some blisters until you developed calluses.  Give it a week or two for your body to develop those and use the wax as needed in the mean time.  If that doesnt work and you dont have a crossbite then your orthodontist might be willing to remove them or at least squeeze them a little closer to the band.

Your orthodontist will probably either be able to straighten that top right tooth some more if you point it out Otherwise they can do some shaping where theyll shave a bit off the side next to your front tooth and be able to pull it down and in more. Im sure theyre aware that everything isnt perfect yet but its always a good idea to voice your concerns if only to ease your mind. Your teeth look fantastic aside from this.

Im  and my mom was pretty pissed that I needed them again considering the circumstances had braces got permanent retainers permanent retainers broke and didnt know fucked up my teeth now have jaw issues have to have tooth pulled blah blah blah. Im paying this go round and luckily my ortho has a sweet deal for people who have had braces before and see shifting. I didnt necessarily NEED the braces but if I didnt get something fixed I would have worse problems down the line.. I would probably end up with them anyways. Because of that the week after I got them I was like holy shit why am I doing this to myself but Im going to stick it out. I had the metal as a teen but I have the ceramic on top and metal at the bottom now. THE CERAMIC ONES ARE SO MUCH BETTER.  Some of my friends have told me they look kind of cool. Im bout it. Ive had them for about  weeks now and its still a bitch to eat I will tell you that.. but i know its going to be SUPER WORTH IT. I have over eating issues and its actually forced me to slow down and enjoy my food more. If i really want something and its a struggle to eat I usually just say fuck it and do it anyways. I love food too much to always eat it all mashed up. I do try to dissolve most of my foods in my mouth before I attempt to chew them though. Its annoying AF but could be worse.. like our friend who commented about having his jaw wired shut. I would die. Feel free to PM me. Two  year olds navigating the world of adult braces together.

7448557,0,t1_d2ot5l5,Sure hes the professional in the situation but at the same time youre the patient and need to speak up about issues that concern you. For all you know the ortho sees where your teeth arent aligned and is trying to speed up the process. Its probably the reason youre using  bands.  My upper and lower molars have been offset since the beginning of my treatment and the teeth behind my canines all had a slight gap but the bands Im using now seem to be resolving those issues. As for my canines yes they touch but my case may not be similar to yours. I have long canines with lengthy roots so signing them to meet is much easier for me than someone with shorter roots. You dont want an ortho to basically pull your teeth out halfway just so they can meet. Orthos are limited in what they can do depending on the physical shape of your teeth.,braces,d2ouqz9,2,t5_2rqo4

Cut food into small peices and chew slowly from the back teeth. Take pain killer of the pain is severe. Anyway all this will go away in couple of days. ,braces,de3vp5v,4,t5_2rqo4

Hang in there you can do it!Especially after you get a new wire each visit get some apple cider vinegar and put a tablespoon in a tall  oz glass of water.

You have so much calculus buildup that it is even clearly visible in the incredibly blurry photo. Buildup leads to periodontal disease which leads tooth and bone loss pretty quickly. ,braces,dfh64ph,1,t5_2rqo4
