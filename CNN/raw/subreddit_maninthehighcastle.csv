5786914,0,t1_cxeeydp,I agree there would certainly be collaborators. There are plenty of Americans who could buy into the racial and antiBolshevik messages of the Nazis. However Smith seems too important to be just another collaborator. He has a very high position and he fought with the Nazis during the war. Also it is unlikely that the SS would allow someone to be so high up unless that person were a pure Aryan which is why I think he is probably the son of GermanAustrian immigrants and that he got involved with Nazi politics early on. Regardless I hope his backstory is something they explore in S. As for collaborators I think it would be interesting to learn more about who is working for the current American government.

5822821,0,t3_3uvezr,Yeah i agree the Resistance characters are are very one dimensional and boring so is the neutral zone I watched the whole season just to see the greater political pictures big decisions between Japan and the Nazis. As a German I find this alternate history very dystopian and very accurate its pretty scary to see how the Nazis established their inhuman ideas in the middle of the NaziAmerican society. The scenes with Franks family in the Kempeitai building and John Smith at his sons doctor appoinment really gave me the creeps.But thats pretty much all I like about the show I dont really get the whole thing around the films. The show starts to feel like Lost very slow development you basically have to watch lots of boring scenes in order to see one really good scene too many questions remain unanswered not a big fan of cliffhangers between seasons and the films as well as the so called Heisenberg devices give it too much of a scifi touch which imo is not suitable for a show about Nazis.,maninthehighcastle,cxiwapw,7,t5_35xe7

I have found the first  episodes worthwhile but lets be honest only in an American produced perspective would we see this much mention of Jews and nothing about Soviets.  The picture being painted is that of the Japanese blowing it. IE Their inability to adequately police their own region and keep it homogenous.  My main question at this point is who careswhy would it matter howwhy the Axis won THE FILM THE FILM!?  Would the German or Japanese public revolt because they found out the Axis won with dirty tactics?  I really hope this isnt the direction being taken.  From what I have seen so far there is noway Americans would liberate their continent without outside intervention USSRUKFrance whatever.

5950097,0,t3_3viwt8,My take on it is that they are in fact travelers. They thought since he is an antique dealer that has a supply of old objects he can travel through considerably more universes.When he started spouting all of the Nazi stuff they knew he wasnt because someone who has seen all of that wouldnt still have that state of mind. So they lost interest in him. Thats why the husband got angry when he came back with the necklace that was fake. They were excited the first time because they thought he knew the secret.

6314392,0,t3_419ebu, Hitler isnt. Its a deliberate parallelism and a red herring the real Man has been announced to be revealed in Season . If the shows anything like the book it should bes a dude named Hawthorne Abendsens. Nice to see someone who liked the ending too and didnt come onto this sub just to complain about how it ruined the vibe. However I think Tagomi entered the separate world by accident  and his assistant from Nagasaki is from our world hence the burns on his hands. The assistant is trying to coax Minister Tagomi into making that discovery. I speculate several other characters  Trudy the Kasouras the Man perhaps even Julianna or Joe  have or can as well.s Remember the Marshall? That is a two dimensional character. And keep in mind Julianas not the only one who makes rookie mistakes  Frank and Joe do it all the time.s Hitler is still powerful yes but hes got Parkinsons and maybe Syphilis. Hes on his way out and that means other people are gonna maneuver into position to pounce on the power vacuum immediately after his death. His power as a leader and symbol is paramount.s Interesting to see how this changes as his sons illness worsens. Also its hinted that he met Wegener working at a Deathcamp in Cincinatti  that will make for some interesting backstory. You have to wonder how he would have been different had he lived in a world where the Nazis didnt win.s Like Smith Kido might have been a good person in a different universe.s You should check out Japanese history immediately after the war ended. The Allies tried Japanese officers for war crimes but the US never had to answer for dropping the bomb twice creating a lot of resentment and humiliation. Douglas MacArthur drafted the new Japanese Constitution and its interesting to see how it varies from the American one and how that shaped international relations since the war. The Yijing the oracle Tagomi consults also has a fascinating history going back  to preConfucian China.

The degree of separation is bigger but not eliminated completely.
