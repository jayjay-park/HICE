10423381,0,t3_5p8amz,gt I just want a platform where I can anonymously talk online for several months before meeting with a girl to establish that Im comfortable with her before meeting for a few nonsexual social events and then progressing to exploring sexual stuff.  Youll be disappointed with FetLife if you try to use it this way.  Imagine doing this with Facebook log in start randomly adding or chatting with people youve never met and trying to develop relationships with people solely through Facebook.  Is that even conceivable?  Not really people use Facebook as a site to keep in touch with people they already know.  Thats what FetLife is except that pretty much everyone there also is kinky.  As you noted meeting in real life is important.  FetLife provides an events section.  That will show all sorts of different events in your area.  What you want to look for is munches which are nonsexual events although sex may be talked about where kinky people get together to socialize.  You mentioned youre introverted thats awesome so am I.  Many of the people in the kink community are as well.  There are several ways you can approach it.  First you could just show up look for an open seat at a table next to some people and when theres an opening in the conversation say Hi Im  and Im new here.  Thatll get a conversation going.  Dont just look for girls by themselves Im assuming youre looking for a girl to ultimately have a relationship with based on your post to approach.  Talk to everyone men and women.  Only talking to solo girls is kinda creepy.  Second the event page on Fet will show who organized the munch.  You can send a message to that person or if there are multiple moderators for the group any of them explaining that youre interested in the munch but that youre also introverted and would just like some help getting to know people in the local community.  Third you could see if there are any Kik groups listed in Fet for people in your local area.  Join one of those or a few and get to know a few people that way.  Thats actually what I did and then when I went to my first munch I recognized several people from there.  All the best.  ,fetlife,dcpk5a5,2,t5_2see6
