1210010,0,t1_ci57lxc,Yes  that definitely helps.  It might be worth while making two lists of differentially expressed genes for those that either move up or down.  You could submit each promoter to one of the many meme analysis programs although I havent done much of this myself.  For that I might just use each string of DNA from the end of the first intron through the sequence  of the gene until it runs into either the beginning or end of another gene.  Id warn you though that these sorts of screens can end in dead ends frequently.Another thing to do would be to plot the loci of each DE gene then see if there are any clusters of genes that have enhanced transcription.  That might imply enhancer activity.Another thing that might be useful would be a pathway analysis if there is any of those sorts of tools for plants.  If there is this would be the first thing that i would do because that might give you some clues on the signal transaction pathway and potential downstream transcription factors.Overall its a really difficult question to answer bioinformatically it may be more easily answered at the bench if there is anything known about the signal transduction pathway under your condition.,bioinformatics,ci5qt4z,2,t5_2qh0x

3721962,0,t1_cqghxni,Yeah  Docker and anything that lets you stick Docker containers together. Algorithms that work on streaming source data live in real time so you can get actionable information as the instrument runs instead of hours later after its finished. Phylogenetic algorithms that dont require the full NxN recomputation of the comparison space when you add in new data. Ways to align phylogenies the same way we now align sequence data. Anyway thats the stuff Id like to have.Right now its pretty common for your scientists and researchers to say we have reads coming off of an Illumina HiSeq every  days or so we want those reads trimmed filtered and errorcorrected then they should be mapped to a reference with Bowtie then we should call variants then we should see what genes those variants are in look for associations with known diseases and produce a summary report in the context of the original sample metadata. Thats not what Iwe do but its a really barebones example of work in the field. The way it works now is your bioinformatics engineers more or less build this pipeline from scratch  they set up a server or a cluster install all the tools and their vast dependencies address dependency conflicts and then tie it together with PerlPythonBash scripts that are basically glue logic and file conversion. And then somebody has the George Jetson job of making sure the pipeline gets started when theres new data.But the way it should work is that the specification I just gave should compile itself into a bioinformatics pipeline that it should be sufficient to specify what tools I want to run in what order and with what settings and then the tools themselves are in containers that inspect each other ok I know youre a reads trimmer so you take a FASTQ as input and emit a FASTQ as output. Im an aligner so Ill take your FASTQ as input and emit a BAM file as output. and hook themselves up. The containers find unused cluster capacity and start running on it. And all of this happens when the first container notices that theres new sequencing data to run on. And because its all containerized I can swap containers out like modules and the pipeline wont even notice.Thats how you get to wholegenomic surveillance of disease thats how you get to personalized genomic medicine thats how you get to bioinformatics as a service architecture that actually helps people. Thats how we get away from artisan analysis and into highthroughput factory analysis.Or so it seems to me anyway. I dont think these are original ideas but it doesnt seem like a lot of people have figured out that its where we have to go. Yet.,bioinformatics,cqgj381,2,t5_2qh0x
3817363,0,t1_cqr8bb3,I am currently trying to start an bioinformatics startup without a deep knowledge of bioinformatics being a generalist. I wholly support ruserapfejes suggestions but Ill add some of my experiences.My approach is to find a problem that needs to be solved and then consider different approaches to a solution. In my case I have landed on bioinformatics as the only viable approach to an industry problem due to the complexity of the problem and the enormous amounts of data that needs to be dealt with. Note that my approach is agnostic i dont care how the solution looks like as long as it solves the problem. I.e. Find a problem then look for a solution. If you dont have your own defined problem find somebody else that is trying to solve a problem and join up with them. Now most bioinformatics researchers I have approached are wholly academics. They do not care for industry applications nor have they any interest in joining startups unless they are feed up with a grant applications getting rejected b academic politics or c the lack of tenure track opportunities. I.e.  winners in academic politics have little incentive to leave academia for a startup.  Look for partners among the disenfranchised postdocs stuck in nontenture tracks young researchers pushed to the side by other more sexy grant applicants etc. After you get funding for research then older more established researchers will become more interested in research collaboration. Essentially these are hired guns that trade part of their attention for research funding. Rarely but not impossible you will find a true champion. Champion someone who dont need you at all have deep knowledge and a rich network and supports you out of sheer altruism and belief in the goodness of your cause. Make such champions your scientific advisors and thank the maker or whatever deity you usually pray to you found them.SWOT is a shorter version of Resource based view RBV and a Porters  Forces F market analysis.

I used to work in bacteria and it is strongly debatable whether M unique reads is enough to reach saturation of the bacterial transcriptome particularly because Illuminas sampling of transcriptsfragments follows a power law. uxylose is absolutely right about FastQCs duplication assumption breaking down for RNAseq but these levels of depth are no where near reaching saturation of the mouse transcriptome.  The low alignment rate raises an alarm. Are the rates that youre reporting from tophat total alignment rate? Concordant or discordant? tophat  or ? accuracy generally improves with newer software... Did you align to mm or directly to an annotated transcriptome? What percentage of these reads are unique? What is your rRNA rate? Exonic rate? intronic rate? Can any of the pairs align concordantly to any bacterial genomes before alignment to mm or whathaveyou? Everyone will want to know where the other reads came from. If you aligned to the transcriptome maybe the unaligned  of your reads came from genestranscripts that arent in the current transcriptome annotation. Or from contaminating DNA not unlikely even with DNAse for that matter was DNAse treatment part of his protocol?. If the rates you reported were concordant only youre observing some very high discordant rates why?,bioinformatics,cver5vb,1,t5_2qh0x

9235393,0,t3_56u6zh,Ive done some machine learning not in this particular domain but have used random forest classifiers so let me see if I could be of some help here. First off youre in the phase that constitutes  of machine learning which is data gathering and cleaning. Welcome! Implementing the actual model is the relatively simple part. Now you need to think critically about what sort of features you want to use and how they pertain to what you want to predict. Yes you can perform things like feature selection to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of your dataset. However since you are creating this dataset from scratch essentially you have the luxury of doing minimal cleaning from someone elses mess. Therefore you should think about which features you might want and think are important beforehand instead of throwing in a bunch of junk that will be trimmed out anyway. In that regard I think including features such as pvalues qvalues and signal values is not useful. Random forest performs best on categorical data hot cold warm and tends to overfit on a lot continuous numeric data .  .. Additionally you can discretize or categorize your numeric data based on intervals of your choosing. You can include numeric data in your dataset but make sure to standardize it if the range of values within a feature are large.Additionally think about what sort of evaluation metric you want to use to assess the performance of your model when you are building it. Some will tell you how well you are predicting the negative class No Enhancer positive class Enhancer or false negs and false positives. You need to think what is more valuable for you that your model predicts and Im assuming in this case it is what is an enhancer. On the subject of bedopsbedtools not giving you the data you want. Take the output from one and the output from the other assuming they have the same primary key for instance region name and align them via sorting which will then make them amenable to joining. Remember you are preparing your own dataset and that requires a significant amount of data wrangling its not always pretty. Another thing to note is that if histone modification signatures are unique to each transcriptional enhancer then you need to remove that feature from the dataset. Anything that is a unique identifier will crash your model and cause it to overfit and give you overly optimistic performance metrics that are not true. Look up the closed world problem. In addition you need to find some info on negative enhancers so that you have a balanced dataset for both the classes you are trying to predict no enhancerenhancer. Thats all for now feel free to PM if you have any questions. Do not get discouraged there is no magic formula or recipe for making machine learning models. Creating a powerful and effective model takes a lot of trial and error and tinkering! Best of luck.,bioinformatics,d8mnjnd,3,t5_2qh0x

10778117,0,t1_ddrof3z,Oh then i severely misjudged your situation. Then yes youre probably better off with a more serious solution. In which case i personally prefer SnakeMake because im a big fan of Python  but there are plenty of alternatives. This is a great paper on the variety by Jeremy Leipzig. He knows his shitBut all of these things are going to come with a cryptic specialist syntax. You just have to choose the one that fits your psychology the best and then of course you will become a big supporter of that particular framework due to reasons like everyone else. My unhelpful advice is spend a day trying them all. See which causes the least despair.,bioinformatics,ddronvr,1,t5_2qh0x
10862083,0,t3_5v9mf0,Im just entering a PhD program in basically bioinformatics statistical genetics specifically and didnt take any computer science courses in either high school or undergrad look into learning it yourself if youre interested CS is one of those skills that is hugely important but also completely free to learn. Start with some basic courses in python or C and work your way up to working on some basic projects for yourself. Though this is separate from actual admission requirements. Your actual programme might mandate that you have taken certain courses and if that is the case it will be difficult to get around. You may want to consult online listings or call  email the specific programmes you are interested in to confirm with them. ,bioinformatics,de0ciag,3,t5_2qh0x

11309840,0,t3_61edsu,I did mean paralog. Thanks for that and the response. And Ive already looked into this. Its a membrane protein so not much luck with good models. Weve done this for an extracellular domain of the protein and that is something we have already included and done some successful experiments on. Weve done extensive MSA studies and we have a good idea of what makes each protein unique in terms of sequence but we dont have any idea what these unique portions do. We also dont understand why you need two proteins that seem to do very similar if not the same thing. Both KO mice are seriously impaired but in very different ways. No one really knows why and no one really understands what the difference is. Like I said both seem to be widely transcribed but the difference in KO models suggests that were missing a lot of differences between the two. We are hoping that a sort of tissue level association would make sense with some of the symptoms of each knockout and give us some indication of how protein expression might be controlled or if there are commonalities in tissue function i.e. one protein always shows up in tissues that do a lot of secreting or signaling etc..,bioinformatics,dfdybmp,1,t5_2qh0x
