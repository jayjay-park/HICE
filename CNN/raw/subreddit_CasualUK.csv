10841041,0,t3_5uo33g,Too many to list but some favourites... The Kinks Amazing catalogue just love them. Clinic Really underrated. Cat Stevens His music is massively overlooked in modern terms. That TV appearance and his comments killed his career  in one fell swoop. I saw him on his comeback a couple of years ago and he was incredible. Im not getting into politics not allowed on here its just an observation but I think had the Rushdie controversy not happened hed be regarded as a national treasure. I dont endorse the man necessarily but his music is great. Pulp I was born in the late s and my earliest memories of getting into music were around the Brit Pop era. I always preferred Pulp to Oasis and Blur although both were good as well. I think the songwriting and stories Jarvis tells are incredible. John Cale Not sure if he counts as hes mostly been based in America throughout his career but I think hes also notable for not attempting to disguise his Welsh accent while singing even while in an American band Velvet Underground. Id argue his solo career was better than Lou Reeds and I say that as someone who absolutely loves Lou Reeds music. Spiritualized Some of the more recent albums have been a bit meh but Ladies and Gentlemen and Pure Phase are incredible albums. No one else sounds like them.,CasualUK,ddy6dhq,1,t5_3j2jr

Luckily I was expecting this so pressed the loud peddle and the  ponies put him back in the rear view mirror safely before it filtered.  He was then right up my arse I could see him shouting and calling me a wanker going mental in my rear view as I chuckled at him.  He then follows me up to my work this should be a laugh I think when he tries to get into my work car park. He pulls into a visitor space and walks up to reception. He was interviewing for a job in the call centre. The look on his face when he saw me say hi to the guy about to interview him was priceless. ,CasualUK,de27q32,13,t5_3j2jr

Eat breakfast every day have    meals per day depending on your daily schedule small meals  times a day is good you dont want to bloat yourself and you wanna be taking around g of carbs per day pasta is good for this. Have one day a week where you can eat whatever shit you want without feeling guilty this will help you stick with your new diet.Other things I will mention is stay away from products labelled as fat free as they replace the fat content with artificial sugars which are worse than fats. You can get your sugar intake from fruit. Eat full fat yogurt and blue top milk if you have to but mostly drink water.In terms of exercise I suggest doing HIIT training where you go all out for  seconds and then have a  second rest. Doing this burns off  more calories per minute than you would just doing that exercise continuously on the same speedintensity.,CasualUK,de7d9w3,1,t5_3j2jr

The bus stops to let someone off and the guy suddenly jumps up and points to someone at the back I couldnt see the guy and starts saying I recognise you from CrimeStoppers.His lass kind of joins in but also tries to settle the guy down and inform the driver of their recent discovery. The driver meanwhile has been asking them to settle down but the alcoholic shpiel is in full flow. The guy then starts to amend his first accusation by adding youre on the run youre wanted for playing with kiddies sick bastard! to which the driver says Im phoning the police if you the accuser dont get off the bus!.Anyway some time passes. The guy is still yelling at the other the girlfriend is trying to get both her boyfriend off the bus and get the police for this socalled felon and I can finally hear the guy at the back saying stuff like I think you have me confused mate.Blue lights sirens and a rush of four coppas put a halt to the whole thing. Two officers unceremoniously drag the megaphone off the bus one speaks to the girlfriend and one has a word with the driver. The drivers interrogator then goes to the back to talk to the accused and asks for his details which seem to check out as he is not escorted anywhere. The bus continues and I get home  minutes late  The End. ,CasualUK,de9otbd,3,t5_3j2jr
