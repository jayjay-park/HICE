6874474,0,t1_d0vj2v4,Well sometimes the flash ulti is worth it. but i agree its overvalued wayyyyyy to much. It seems all the casual morgs are blinded by this. Especially when they use zhonya initially and everyone just walks out of the ults second proc. instead of using it right at the last moment to get the second tether and then survive any burst,MorganaMains,d0vj9e8,1,t5_38rbi
