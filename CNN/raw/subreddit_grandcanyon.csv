3201990,0,t1_cotvni7,Thanks  Ill definitely be back to hikecampstay longer someday! Its a really last minute road trip so we thought wed just swing by the Canyon real quick. ,grandcanyon,cotvwaw,1,t5_2shn3
3346208,0,t3_2w69j9,It totally depends on how quick a hiker you are as a team i.e. youre only as fast as the slowest.In general they say that going to the river and back is NOT a day hike and thats a fine rule of thumb but for plenty of locals that absolutely is a day hike. I dont consider myself a strong hiker at all but Im confident I could go to the river and back in a day assuming Im on the trail fairly early setting off by ish would give me plenty of time.If you want a solid Grand Canyon experience quick then going down South Kaibab Trail to Phantom Ranch then up Bright Angel Trail back up to the rim will give you an excellent feel for what the corridor region of the GC is like. Note however this this is a long day  miles and  vertical feet. If youre a strong hiker and get an early start you can absolutely do it in a day giving you a day or two to rest or continue on your journey. Note however that if you start down any trail in the Grand Canyon without a camping permit it is required you hike out with every step downward you commit yourself to that step back upwards as well.If  miles and going ALL the way to the bottom and back up in a day doesnt sound fun going down Bright Angel trail is always a good option. There are rest stops potentially with water depending on the time of year every . miles all of which make great turnaround points. As long as you budget your time and realize that going up will take about . times longer and be a lot more strenuous its fine to just start hiking down the trail till you figure you should turn back. If you start in the morning and go at a leisurely pace or start around noon and move relatively fast there is no reason you shouldnt be able to comfortably get to Plateau Point and back up or something similar which I highly recommend.The thing about the Grand Canyon is that its kinda just a giant hole in the ground with rare exception all trails go downward and end at the river unless you want to walk around at the rim so the only thing you need to decide is how far down youre willing to go before turning around and as they say going down is optional going up in mandatory.,grandcanyon,cp9oyk7,2,t5_2shn3

7652898,0,t1_d3c2hmh,I would definitely encourage doing some stairmaster type workouts if you dont have access to hiking  Im not sure what part of the country you are in but it helps that Im in Phoenix with a lot of hikes and increasing elevation in the heat.Try and find someone to hike with  if anything itll be nice so you have someone to talk to and will make the time go by faster since its really long. And at the end when it got extremely hard it really helped to have someone there to like motivate me to not stop. If you are truly going alone go early because when we hiked up Bright Angel there was almost no one on the trail and at least with other hikers around it can help you stay a little more sane toward the end.,grandcanyon,d3c3bdd,1,t5_2shn3

8574549,0,t1_d6ddvtp,Oooh that does sound like fun. Being able to see more of the rim would be fun and Im sure the visitor center will be crowded. We might not drive out immediatly but maybe when we go out well grab the east rim drive. And the rivers is definitely a plus!Thank you for your suggestions!,grandcanyon,d6degee,1,t5_2shn3

10501391,0,t3_5qafz5,When I went my friend found cell service at the oddest places on the trails. Her phone would ping with messages once in a while.  We were on the south kaibob and then bright angel trails. She used her phone mainly for taking pictures.  ,grandcanyon,dcyfzeq,1,t5_2shn3
