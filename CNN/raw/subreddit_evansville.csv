818647,0,t1_cgx85sg,Gotcha. Most comment threads do it seems. I personally think its a mental illness type thing that needs to be addressed. And I wonder why here? Why is Evansville the epicenter? ,evansville,cgxbzn8,1,t5_2sl0p
898833,0,t3_24eqmt,You may check RiRas and see if they have any openings. For larger parties theyll put you in the upstairs area by yourselves.If you want something casual Turonis might be able to work something out for a larger party as well. Any location should work.,evansville,ch6gaf4,3,t5_2sl0p

1961333,0,t1_ckped1g,Cant help you with the hiking   A few friends of mine play in coed soccer leagues at Metro and they seem to enjoy it....come to think of it there may be a bar in the complex as well.  Looking at the terribly designed site it looks like that may need to be a whole team though as opposed to individual signups.  Not sure honestly...nor am I sure if it is fun or super competitive.  May be worth giving Metro a call to see what they have.As far as beer the Winetree on Weinbach and Washington has the best selection of liquor stores.  The best selection at a bar which I just discovered is actually a chain place in Newburgh called Beef OBradys...its very strange that its there but they really have awesome beers all of the time.  If you like microbrews that is.   Floyds is a brewery located in Munster IN and its pretty consistently ranked among the top  microbreweries in the country.  It is carried there...If you can get Gumballhead or Zombie Dust please give yourself that gift.There is really good food and really good beer in Evansville if you know where to go.  Id put Evansvilles pizza scene on par with any seriously Deerhead Mojos and Lamascos all get great musical talent in from time to time all are barsrestaurants.  The bar that gets the biggest crowd is a place called the Time Out Lounge and its on the Eastside in Washington Square Mall.  It is a huge place and its a very eclectic crowd for better or worse.  Happy to help more if you have specific questions.  You like drinking beer so thats good...its something we really know how to do around here ,evansville,ckpjjdd,2,t5_2sl0p
2213008,0,t1_cll3uuq,Yup its been gone for several months. As far as I my addled brain can recall the Czar was the original.  alcohol. The dropped it for the summer and replaced it with Ferrous which is around . Theyre bringing back Czar for the winter but I dont know if theyll keep both stouts. The other change is they often have guest beers mostly from other Indiana breweries. ,evansville,cll4kgf,1,t5_2sl0p

2951051,0,t1_co3gyk2,I live on the west side somewhat close to Reitz and some of the neighborhoods are nice some are not.  I would say its mostly families around the west side but none of it is really walkable.  The only real walkable part of town is downtown around the river front and it is trying to become what you are looking for but I dont see it really happening.  Not to mention its is next to the south side with a new shooting every week I wouldnt want to live either place. ,evansville,co3jqy5,2,t5_2sl0p

4651356,0,t3_3endtz,There is actually quite an artistic subcommunity in Evansville...it isnt very visible but it is absolutely there.  Check out some of the stores on Haynes Corner...that area from my limited experience people are super friendly and theres a sense of revival so they are pretty excited sometimes its like a Christoper Guest movie but that can be cute.  Graphic novels you may lean more toward comic book meetups  gaming events stuff like that...those exist as well but somebody else may know more of that than I. ,evansville,ctgv54f,4,t5_2sl0p

10700694,0,t3_5t1n7h,Transmission work is serious business not something you can do in a day. Youd want a good diagnoses first. Many automatic transmission problems can be simple vacuum sensor or electronic module issues not even problems with the transmission its self.Malibus are terrible terrible cars Im still cheezed about one I had years ago. Maybe the much newer ones got better but mine was around the same year as yours.,evansville,ddjp3qa,2,t5_2sl0p
