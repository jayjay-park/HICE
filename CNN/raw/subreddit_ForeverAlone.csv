32679,0,t3_1uf9xm,I dont necessarily think having a girlfriend would fix all of myanyone elses problems. What I do think is that a lifetime of failure at something that is important to you is really damaging. Having a significant other who has sex with you probably makes you happier. Having a significant other who you love makes you even happier than that. Neither one is going to give you happiness alone though. On the other hand feeling hopeless or like nobody loves you or wants to have sex with you those things are extremely damaging. They tear down your confidence and take away a great deal from your happiness. ,ForeverAlone,cei5hdg,2,t5_2s3yz
33736,0,t1_cei7xqr,Well I work with what is given to me. He believes he has no intrinsic value at least in the eyes of women.He does need to stop worrying about the value he has to others though. I mean who are these people? Why do we care so much what women think if they write us off so dismissively?The thing is there ARE women who arent materialistic who dont drink whod rather stay in and play Nintendo or Settlers of Cataan. Its just a matter of networking so you might cross paths.I met my current girlfriend through Fetlife. And maybe thats not your cup of tea. But she posted a thread aboutactivitiesand I responded that they sounded fun. Nothing more mostly because men become such lecherous horndogs on those sites. So I tried to express agreement without presuming anything. And she messaged me and here we are. Its also an open relationship and she has two teenage sons so part of why were together is I stuck around when others would have left.And that was a chance message. Its not a dating site nor was it a classified ad. And Ive tried other avenues too rr OkCupid eHarmony other dating sites and talking to the girls at this one bar I frequent. Nada.And about OkCupid I think the reason it doesnt work for a lit of people is because it reduces everyone to a list of statistics to be affirmed or denied. You get rejected there because it takes little more than scanning for a favorite word and a lazy mouse click.Its really easy to lose hope. And its easy to get carried away and show your cards when you should just keep it light and social. I think once in a while we just need a quick escape to occupy ourselves when we get rejected.,ForeverAlone,cei9t9r,3,t5_2s3yz

46039,0,t1_cejn0pe,gtThats kind of funny how they make failing to maintain serious relationships seem like some kind of virtue. Ive been divorced twice and have three kids so I think its safe to assume that a male virgin just doesnt have my good judgment honed from years of experienceJust because a relationship doesnt last forever doesnt mean it was a failure.  I think it has a lot more to do with the fact that its just weird to get to  without ever having any kind of real relationship.  Makes you wonder what exactly is wrong with this guy who has gone so far in life without participating in the dating world?  Does he have terrible social skills?  Is he just boring?  Is he secretly crazy or homeless?  Maybe hes some kind of deviant.Even if you dont jump to conclusions like that you can at least infer that the person has no experience in a certain facet where experience is really important.  Even failed relationships present lessons to be learned.  Often important ones and theyre cumulative.  No one knows what theyre doing when they first start dating but they figure it out over time because most normal people date at least semifrequently.  If youre  years old and going on a date for the first time of course you have no idea what youre doingbut in theory the person youre out with probably doesnt either.  In expectation by the time youre  most people have probably been on many dates and likely at least a couple of longerterm relationships so if youre looking to go out with someone new you can probably expect them to have had roughly the same amount of experience with such things.  I guess what Im saying here is that if youre  and havent ever dated someone seriously its going to present problems because youre going to be looking to date other  year olds but you have about as much experience as a  year old.  The person you go out with will feel like theyre dating a teenager in many respects.  And that is absolutely a problem.,ForeverAlone,cejo7ox,6,t5_2s3yz

225478,0,t1_cf3tdgf,Thanks for the engrossing response.  I skipped the TLDR and just read the rest.  Your situation is very perplexing and I could only call it this you are too good to be true but also too much to take in.  That is how you come off.  That is a difficult person to be.  And I can see that your insecurity gets the best of you you react in a way that reenforces the impression that you are too much to handle.  The aloofness the withdrawing understandable after being burned you flinch at flame right?  I think what happens is that people begin to stop seeing you as a person and as a collection of attractive parts in all the right places.  You become the victim of that nasty social shorthand of preconceived notions.  People expect you to be a certain way based on your appearance and then when you prove to be more than they bargained for they are confused frustrated or more generally turned off.  You knock them off their game so to speak.  Then there are those defensive mechanisms used by the serially rejected.  The clamming up and signals that you arent interested.  I am guilty of what I call the offensive defense.  I reject before I can be rejected.  When I find myself in the presence of a woman Im attracted to I assume the rejection is forthcoming and work to establish that I am not interested or possibly even slightly repelled.  I also practice avoidance and deflection.  I just dont hang out or go to places where I might be expected to meet women who are interested in meeting guys.  If I do I find things to do conversations to become engrossed in or reasons to leave early to avoid the expectations and presumed rejections.   Despite all this I remain content.  Im an introvert by nature and really wither in such highintensity social activities as clubbing or bar hopping or such.  It exhausts me and I dont enjoy it.  Im glad to hear that you are taking the brute forcemass quantity approach.  I too have seen it work for others as well.  I hope it works out and at least finds you some high quality friends in the process. ,ForeverAlone,cf448in,4,t5_2s3yz

275115,0,t3_1x6s78,What the hell Im in a very kick myself while I am down mood.I am a yo guy.  Ill just go through the categories that I think are important.FamilyI have either disowned or been disowned by nearly all of my family members.  My mothers side of the family are very religious and judgmental.  I dont have the correct sexuality which they dont understand and dont try to understand.  Both my mother and my grandmother have threatened to kill me.  My fathers side of the family is mostly already dead.  My father ran off with a new girlfriend.  When she decided she wanted him all to herself she made him choose between us.  He didnt pick me.  The only family I have left is my brother who I see maybe once a month.  He hates our parents too and is trying to build his own life and doesnt really have time for a lot. FriendsI have had one friend in my life.  He was my friend through elementary school then he moved away after th grade the last grade before middle school and Ive never seen or heard from him again.  He was routinely over at our house for those years because our family took pity on him.  To this day his mother is the most neglectful human being I have ever had the displeasure of knowing in person.  At our house he got food sleep and was able to bath.  Since then I have gone roughly thirteen consecutive years and counting without even one friend.  I now lack the experience and understanding to make friends even if I cared enough to try anymore.RomanceI am a pedophile.  Ive known that since I was thirteen and at that point repressed my sexuality.  I didnt give it a second thought I was routinely bullied at school for being the one that didnt understand the most basic of innuendos until after I had turned  and over the next few years my depression really set in.  Since I have a sexuality that cannot be safely expressed I truly have absolutely no chance at finding a partner for the rest of my life.  I have never had sex.  I have never had a first kiss.  I have never had nor ever will have any kind of sexual or romantic experience with another person legal or otherwise.SocietyDue to who I am I am typically hated by the general public.  While the topic doesnt come up every day hating pedophiles is a topic of conversation that has come up with coworkers before and Ive been forced to play along.  There is no one that I can open up to.  Even if I made friends they could never know the real me.  I would have to forever hide my real self from them.  I cannot seek help from mental health professionals.

Most people can understand how it feels to be new at something and being nervous. Its an almost universal experience. Understanding inexperience and being willing to put up with inexperience are two pretty different things though.  The older you get there are going to be fewer people in your peer group that are willing to deal with someone who doesnt know what theyre doing.gtBut I just dont think that a lack of experience should keep you from trying to gain that experience.

651099,0,t1_cgdzwaj,gt Men have to be excellent in every way body job confidence character while women are only expected to look somewhat decently and not be mentally deranged.Where does this belief come from?  I understand the grass is always greener on the other side but come on.gt  I find it incredibly unfair and irritating since women are never met with this response due to being granted inherent value simply for being female.I dont know whether to laugh or just feel so sorry that you have such a misguided brain.  Ok get this change women to men.  You have the exact same sentence you hear a lot of women saying about actually serious issues.  Job discrimination?  Wage differences?  How could you be in CS youre a woman? Lets be serious here.  I find it incredible unfair and irritating that women excel within so many fields through hard work and yet we still see such a lack of women within higher positions in society.  Whats the explanation?  Well theyre probably more dedicated to their children They dont have children?  Well theyre probably more dedicated to their husband Theyre not married? Well...pms and shit... imagine having a woman president who has pms  yeah thats what theyre stripped down to just being a woman is grounds enough to not give them a promotion.  So which would you choose then?  Would you rather apparently have a step up in the dating game or have a step up in jobs education and overall being perceived as having inherent knowledge because youre male?gt But I do not blame women for that I blame the massive droves of men who are content with anything that has a vagina and doesnt look absolutely repulsive.Who are these massive droves of men you speak about?  Besides here on FA I havent seen anything like that. gt The standards most men hold their girlfriendswifes character and personality to are almost nonexistant.Nope...very untrue.gt Petulant and bitchy? No problem.Stuck up and pretentious?  No problem. gt Uneducated and dumb? Doesnt matter.Ok thats actually proven through studies to be untrue.  Maybe in the past but with women being able to get an education now and women actually excelling within education statistics show that majority of the time people of equal education come to together.  That means menwomen who hold for example a Masters degree will most often marry someone who also has a Masters degree.  So no your assumption is wrong.  Unless you want to wander into the world of trophy husbandswives which shows nothing except that some men and women want a prize on their arm. gt Sad or depressed? Someone will gladly help you.Since when?  Last I checked more women than men suffer from depression specifically women are twice as likely to suffer than their male counterparts and  of that goes untreated.  So maybe if some awesome and pretty girl is feeling down for a day her male friend will help her  but that is definitely not like a below average woman suffering from actual depression. gt If men stopped putting women on a pedestal and giving them special treatment all the timeIf the world stopped putting men on a pedestal and giving them special treatment for everything all the timegt if being shy boring and uneducatedpoor had the same repercussions for women as for menIt has no help for women  not anymore anyway when women are given more opportunities within education and career.gt there would be as many or more FAwomen as men Im sure of it.What statistic shows that there arent more FAwomen than men?  Reddits womenhating version of FA holds no facts.gt Again I know there are exceptions and I acknowledge that there are women who have genuine problems and have a hard time getting boyfriends. However I also say that a man put into their shoes would have an even harder time.I say put yourself in a womans shoes for one day and youll never want to go back again.  ,ForeverAlone,cgea35o,10,t5_2s3yz

676630,0,t1_cgh1tdi,Online dating is at best one facet of a multipronged approach and I say that despite currently dating someone I met on Okcupid. Girls on dating sites often receive anywhere from twenty to hundreds of messages weekly from super scuzzy guys. Its tiring sorting through that much bullshit hoping to find someone genuine and interesting. So not only do you need to stand out in any message you send to weed yourself out from the scuzzy dudes but theres a good chance that she wont even see your message from sheer exhaustion. Its like running through your spam folder to find a modestly important email. At which point would you just give up? So by default your success rate isnt going to be great.

697644,0,t1_cgj2rec,gtYoure missing the crucial point. The study does not say  of all guys are unattractive it says  of guys on OKCupid are unattractive in comparison to all guys. Why? Because women only have a profile picture to go on. Conclusion? Looks arent everything.No youre missing the crucial point. You insisted the standards of beauty are higher for women yet this study shows exactly the opposite. Women rate a much higher percentage of males as unattractive than men rate females. gtYoure still missing the point that despite thinking someone is unattractive women still initiated conversation and were interested in that person. Meanwhile men are far less likely to do so if they think someone is less attractive.The only conclusion you can take from that study is that women look for more than just attractiveness in men. Fuck no thats not what that study showed. Women almost never message men on dating websites to begin with. Read it again.

862847,0,t3_23z2zb,I would say you are definitely not alone.  I try to explain to others that when I see a beautiful woman it is little different than a beautiful sunset or a painting.  It isnt really sexual for me.  I have been told that for most guys it is.My guess is that somewhere in the back of their mind they think I could be with that if I want to.  Even the married guys can think that... its the reality of a possibility that turns the admiration of beauty into a sexual connection.Given that we havent ever had sex we dont think that.  Or at least I dont.  I just think... wow nice legs.  Wow... beautiful sunrise.  No different really.  It is true that sometimes I think Why cant I find someone like that.  But in the end we always know... it is for others but not for us.As for sex drive... I dont really know what that is.  I dont feel anything like that.  Now in my s it has been a very long time since I felt anything like that and Im not really sure I ever felt that much of it back then either... I cant really remember.  Its been said that men think of sex once every  minutes or some crazy low number like that.  I can go days without even realizing there is this thing called sex out there in the world.Maybe its because I spent a lot of time become master of my emotions years ago.  I am even able to suppress a great deal of physical pain.  My doctors have even warned me about it.

We agreed to meet up last Sunday  I told my parents I was visiting a friend put on the most skintight shirt I have and went over there to meet her.  We hung about awkwardly for a bit watched some Netflix etc.  The whole time I was there however she was more interested in at different points either her dog or her phone than in me.  Now perhaps I should have made a move except that by the time we had spent a few hours together and I was comfortable enough to do so she was giving signs that she clearly didnt want to do so.  Hell she wouldnt even let me sit next to her when I asked.  Thinking back I can think of no overly awkward things I did besides my usual demeanor which I told her about beforehand.

1361560,0,t1_cim9ez0,I completely agree with you. I saw other commentors on here saying Ive always hated when people think they are entitleddeserve sex! and in a literal sense of course this is true. But from an emotional sense of course everyone feels entitled in way. I know that I personally have it kind of easy in the field sorry if I shouldnt be posting I found this thread through a link although Im not gorgeous I dont get gorgeous people and I generally have to work for it. But Ive always had a somewhat strong need for sex since not long after losing my virginity and it would be emotionally devastating if I was incapable of filling that need.I think the disconnect is using language like entitled. People hear that and start thinking of semi if not nonconsensual because its being made to sound like its expected whether wanted or not and that is bound to turn some noses up understandably. But youre right on the general its just people vocalizing their discontent with a situation that would make  of the worlds adult population very angry bitter and discontented. And people need to start realizing that what theyre hearing is the anger and feelings of loneliness and betrayal by people who are merely human and are hurting.All of this is said under the assumption that you dont literally believe in semi or nonconsensual relief of your pain of course...,ForeverAlone,cimym6g,3,t5_2s3yz

1362567,0,t3_29mgy1,Three really insidious things about experiences where trying to socialize is a torture. The negative mental state associated with that experience makes you unpleasant and unappealing to others.. Approaching socializing in that way creates habits which help lead to similar experiences later.. Its not sustainable and leads toward giving up on socializing.Theres a definite pattern in my experiences. When it felt like torture and I was trying very hard that tended to result in failures. Successes involved a more relaxed and enjoyable state. There still can be fear but its something I pushed through quickly without it seeming like torture. There can still be trying but its reasonable manageable and even easy and not extreme maximum exertion.,ForeverAlone,cin35gd,1,t5_2s3yz
1366116,0,t1_cingh2h,Yea. Youre around my age so I can definitely relate to how you feel. My advise to you. Like uacedur mentioned above. Do some soul searching and try your best to move forward. Just spend like an entire day by yourself examining where youre at in life how far youve come and what things other than womenrelationships bring you piece of mind. Hopefully you have some things you utterly enjoy doing and it puts a smile on your face. For me its going out and hitting the streets skating. It might be something completely different for you. Whatever your things are do them. Another thing. You may not look at it but if you do cut out the porn in your life. It makes a huge difference mentally. The way that you naturally feel every time you look at that stuff it subconsciously beats you over the head  times and you feel like shit whether you realize it or not. Cut it out for at least a week then come back to me and tell me how you generally feel. I guarantee youll feel better. I hope some of this helps you ,ForeverAlone,cinj5rl,1,t5_2s3yz

However personality overrides appearances. It completely transforms the way you see someone and if I fall for someones character you can bet your ass Im going to fall for their looks too. Finally if this gives you any reassurance Im a white woman who has made out with a lot of black dudes and happily would again.

1449223,0,t3_2aps5c,I first really noticed my social anxiety at the beginning of th grade. Prior to that Id been vaguely and intermittently aware that I wasnt very good at talking to people or making friends but it didnt really bother me  I assumed I would just make friends later and that the people around me were kind of lame and immature. I sometimes got anxious around people as well but usually in response to someonesomething I perceived as threatening rather than in anticipation. Then at the beginning of th grade I went on an interstate trip with the school orchestra and for the first time I became deeply consciously aware of how much worse I was at social interaction than everyone else. Id been on school trips before so Im not sure what made this one different. Maybe it was seeing the one friend I relied upon in the past talking confidently to girls while I stood around awkwardly. Maybe it was having a lot of free time to go exploring the city and having no one to go with. Maybe it was just a matter of time seeing everyone else mature while I remained stuck in a kind of extended childhood my parents have much of the blame for this. Whatever the cause the whole experience felt like being stuck under a cold shower without end. I tried to socialise normally but found myself unable to say anything. I tried to pretend to be happy but I could barely manage to hold back tears. The thing that hurt most was that I knew how weird and ugly and creepy I must have looked to everyone else and yet I was powerless to stop it. I couldnt change myself because everything leading up to this point in my life had made me into the person I was. I couldnt retreat into some kind of quasiautistic obliviousness because I had enough social awareness to know what was required of me. Instead I withstood day after day I think the trip was only  days but it felt like eternity locked in my mind watching myself make a fool of myself. The only way I could cope was by reassuring myself that I would never ever again put myself through such a horrible situation this attitude has left me even more lonely and depressed. The more I think about it the more I become convinced that this trip represented a kind of turning point in my perception of myself before I left I was basically convinced I was a normal person after I came home I was basically convinced that I wasnt. This conviction of my own abnormality defectiveness retardation etc has pretty much persisted without interruption for the seven years since then and has probably deepened over time to become engraved permanently into my personality. ,ForeverAlone,cixxp2e,4,t5_2s3yz

On various interest driven subreddits they have meetups in every major city. I went to a philosophy meetup in downtown denver for example. It was very fun. In pretty much ever major city there are gaming cafes and bars. what started as an investigation in a gaming arena ended in a weekly ritual of meeting up with other dota players having competitions inhouse scrimmages and even winning merchandise on occasion.,ForeverAlone,cjj0rkd,3,t5_2s3yz

1624296,0,t1_cjjjju3,I wasnt talking about approaching specifically but initiating any form of social contact. For instance one time in high school at the start of the school year when no one knows each other a girl was looking for some paper to borrow but she didnt know anybody. I could see her scanning the room not for students but for someone who she doesnt find intimidating at all. Literally her eyes were going back and forth deciding who she should ask I was behind her she didnt ask me though after looking at me.She asked one shy normal looking dude behind me for paper that time and they started talking more and more each day until they became close friends.She didnt approach in the way you thought I was talking about but she initiated contact and built a relationship with some dude because he was the least intimidating. All Im saying is the most average dudes with no distinctinctive features have it the best socially.Also another point would be that he did nothing proactive at all to be friends with her so I dont believe that all people successful at meeting people actually put forth any effort. They are just at the right place at the right time and this situation can apply to many other social interactions.

The majority of women see it as a red flag if you dont have any friends at all.  Even shy women with very few friends will wonder why they are the only ones that you spend time with.  Maybe an FA girl would be accepting but I most others probably arent.  Im on dating sites but I think I need to find at least  friend to speak of on dates or in the end my dating will go no where even when I get one.,ForeverAlone,cjlmdlh,1,t5_2s3yz

1775484,0,t3_2esugn,Ive lived like a hermit from May  when I graduated college to May  when I got my first job. A whole fucking year. Here are a few of my observations You can never live this lifestyle unless you have support from your family friends or government. By support I mean financially and even emotionally on some dark fucking days.  If you have social anxiety it will intensify greatly. Even seeing someone you know out in public from far away will scare the shit out of you thats assuming you even go out. Youll always try to avoid meeting friends or family to hang out. Thats because youll feel like you dont belong with them normal people. Youve got nothing to talk about.  As time passes by youll lose any desire to work and get a job because youll just feel like youre not worth it and that youre no good for anything. Youll feel so behind your peers its fucking scary. Everyone seems to be having their shit sorted out while you just fucking stare at your screen. Soon enough youll develop a hatred for people. Youll think like why is everyone so happy and content in their life while Im just here stuck in my own prison?  Almost certainly youll be depressed and its not gonna be easy to get out of this rut without some help family friends therapy..etc. Finally youll need a lot of help from family or whoever cares about you to help you feel normal and function in society again. I know I did.If you can take all of the above then be a hermit.. But you better believe youll feel like shit for having no fucking purpose in life. I dont blame anyone who is a hermit because I know firsthand that all hermits hate the outside world. In the end I thank my family for supporting me without them I wouldve been a hermit my whole fucking life. My simple advice to anyone who is thinking about isolating themselves is dont put yourself in this situation in the first place if you wanna succeed because youll be stuck. If you dont believe me go ahead and try it and youll see what Im talking about.,ForeverAlone,ck2ydfg,5,t5_2s3yz

2007114,0,t1_ckute35,gt  I think a lot of people here dont like to hear that because the disease models of depression and anxiety allow them to deflect responsibility away from themselves. As long as they have some external problem to blame they can avoid confronting the root issues that really scare them. This seems messed up to me in many ways. I guess psychology is kind of like a religion changing peoples views of reality and responsibility. It seems to me that depression anxiety and being FA are all similar in the broadest sense as kinds of mind malfunctions. The fact that depression and anxiety are disorders but what I describe apparently isnt just shows how psychology is imperfect. Also I dont think people recover from any of these well by simply having professionals and medication do the work all need some kind of personal involvement effort and change.gt Id be curious to hear more about how you consciously encourage connection when interacting people.The most important thing is relaxing. Im sure its possible to connect anxiously but I havent explored that yet and at least for interactions with strangers in various settings relaxation is best. This can be tricky because anxiety can be taken for granted forming a sort of tension which tries to avoid things that feel risky and via that prevents connection.Feeling good definitely makes it easier because then I can smile genuinely and offer positivity instead of having negativity that I dont want to share. Again Im sure its possible to connect in some situations while depressed but I havent explored that much. Its nice to be in an activity which both makes me feel good and offers opportunities for socializing. Alternatively socializing right after an uplifting activity can help.Eye contact is important but it has to be the right kind of eye contact not simply looking at the person like when checking out attractive body features but with a feeling of looking deeper into the person. Meanwhile there can be a feeling of compassion not an obligation to help more like an appreciation of details. Smiling definitely helps but really the thing to strive for is a genuine and ideally mutual smile not a struggle to smile. Theres some freedom to manipulate feelings and put some genuineness into a smile but in general the farther I am from the true me the harder it can be to connect.Constantly thinking a lot can prevent connection opportunities and its actually an escapist and mostly useless activity. Its necessary to spend some of the time just being there not thinking.Another technique that helps is redirecting my mind away from unproductive negative and problematic observations when those arise without allowing them to build up into trains of thought.gt  Also whats an example of the differences between the same interaction with and without connection?Without connection theres less eye contact and Im speaking at the person not fully to the person. There is virtually no conscious awareness of the other persons mental state and comparatively little awareness regarding details their appearance and personality. Without connection feelings of attraction are cravings for particular body parts and details. Connection makes it less like a craving and more about the person overall. Im far better at remembering individuals if I connect.,ForeverAlone,ckv1zlt,2,t5_2s3yz

2263628,0,t1_clrbt85,The short answer no.  The long answer As I mention elsewhere on this thread Im personally not into alpha males or aggressive guys. Just to give an example I once went on a date with a guy who literally yelled at the valet. Sure he proved he wasnt a pushover. But did he get a second date? Hell no!!  But in the interest of full honesty Ill tell a short anecdote I dated a guy in college who told me that he had some sort of runin with a douchebag on his floor and proudly related that his response to this confrontation was to burst into fake tears which made the douchebag hastily apologize and flee. I was just like what is wrong with you?? But thats not really being a pathetic pushover thats being a manipulative weirdo.  But this guy also started crying for realall the time. He missed his mom who lived in NY and  had just happened. We had only just been dating for a few days and this guy is crying all the time. I was like Im not doing this. Although he might have thought I dumped him because he was a lame pushover in reality it was because he was totally emotionally unhinged.  Anyway I tell this story to provide nuance to your question no I dont want a manly man who will sweep me up in his strong arms and defend me from bad guys but I do want an SO who is emotionally stable. And I would expect men to want emotionally stable women as well.A corrollary there ARE women who are attracted to guys who are pathologically aggressive. My mom and my cousin are examples. Both had three children with total psychos who would have benefitted society more if theyd been euthanized at birth. But even in these cases the women arent usually attracted to the aggression theyre attracted to the person the man is in calmer moments sensitive charismatic. They put up with the aggression because they think the other stuff makes it worth it. Of course theyre wrong. If youre really curious read up on codependent relationships.,ForeverAlone,clri663,2,t5_2s3yz

Chances are she is going to abuse the shit out of this social dynamic. You will feel like shit when she doesnt text you back because you think she might be losing interest. You will question your worth as a human being constantly.  This is a pathetic but natural reaction when you are head over heads for someone and you never know when they are going to tell you they are not interested.

I know the common advice is to just tell her how you feel but the truth is girls will reject you  times silently before they reject you verbally. They do it by being passive towards you by ignoring your texts by trying to not hang out  with you and yes it is very indirect and it can be frustrating. But why do they do it? Because all women are sadistic succubi that delight in mentally torturing men? No it is because she is actually being kind enough to give you a chance to get the message and then halt your advances. If you dont though and instead insist on making the girl formally reject you will put her an extremely uncomfortable situation she will then attempt to remove herself from the uncomfortable situation which means avoiding you completely. Sure she might still be semi friendly when she sees you but she will definitely repel any attempts that you make to contact her textsfb chatsinvitations for lunch. This prevents any chance of continuing to be friends at least in the immediate future. So if you have to ask her out for yourself go for it but prepared for the consequences this entails.

2553477,0,t1_cmrnkpk,gtId like to hear advice from someone who is an ACTUAL VIRGIN and not condescending.It is condescending because its hard to talk about sex to someone who hasnt had it without being a little condescending in my view.  Its like talking about any other experience someone hasnt had that you really dont think is a big deal to someone who hasnt had it and thinks its a big deal.And would you really want to hear it from an actual virgin?  It would kind of be like the blind leading the blind.  The therapy aspect is dead on.  The guy isnt at a loss for finding girls to sleep with hes unable to perform which is a very different issue than I would guess many people in this sub have.Also I guess this will sound terrible but giving so much meaning to just losing your virginity is a very virgin thing to say.  That sounds terrible but as in I really dont meet many people who put much emphasis on their first time besides it was just getting it over with it.

Theres no cure for depression so I have to try to meet someone who will accept a mild mental illness. This is surprisingly difficult. Im a super high functioning depressive though but if Im going to date someone...they get to see the parts of me that no one else really gets to see.  I never want children. Im childfree by choice and I havent met anyone yet who also doesnt want children. I hesitate to get into relationships or date because the number of childfree men out there is still surprisingly low. A lot of guys in their s are still sitting on the maybe fence usually leaning towards at least having one kid and wont date me. Which is fine...I cant date them of course. I also dont do casual dating or flings or hookups.  I go to university but Im in a field that is generally all female except for gay men. Well at least in the cohort Im in this year thats how it is. I study costume design. I decided recently to just stop trying  at even bothering to go out of my way to find opportunities to interact with men. Im gonna focus on school and my career instead.

2630975,0,t1_cn1w3cf,Fair fair. But listen man and anyone else who is FA and doesnt drink due to personal preference not drinking is obviously fine and definitely healthier for you in the long run but you should know that this decision is sort of like arbitrarily setting socialization to very hard mode. I know several people who are wellliked and had a good time in college without ever drinking but they had very different parameters for what they wanted out of their social life. Plus they generally had more intense issues with alcohol i.e. addiction in the family. One of my best friends was like that...but then again he was dropdead funny. Hes never made hanging out with women a priority  his gf initiated their entire relationship. Hes one of the reasons I always have to smile when people in this sub say that girls will never try to talk to you unless youre in the top  of male attractiveness or whatever hes a very awkward looking dude hes just funny as fuck and everyone loves to be around him. If thats you more power to ya. That dude lives the life PC games like  of the day.But if youre looking for a social life like popular people have and youre looking to find a girlfriend in the barclub scene a word of advice have a couple of beers. Does it seem like when youre at a bar people close you out from conversations? Thats because talking to a sober person you dont know too well when youre drunk can be uncomfortable. Does it seem like your sense of humor isnt jiving with everyone elses? Could be that you dont know what drunk people find funny its a different sillier type of entertainment. Does it seem like everyone else is dancing but you cant get the rhythm down? Dancing is like x easier when youre tipsy.Im not saying Get so drunk you yak and wake up with a killer hangover  Im saying if youre going to try out the bar scene have like  beers and see where that gets you. Ill wager youll feel like you fit in a lot more. And if you feel like bars just aint your style find what is your style and try to be happy with it.

So stick with friends if you can but use my tips above for new people. . Alcohol. Dont drink too much.

Anyone who has friends AND has had sex isnt FA but as long as theyre not going around pity partying about how FA they are I dont care. It only makes me rage when its a ridiculous claim. Theoretically I do believe some people are born to live and die alone. So even some of the young ones might have some deep intuition that this is their fate in life.

I do try to take good care of myself no fast food decently closed I actually enjoy shopping and would love to if my SO would do so as well if I ever find her.. However I am terribly shy when it comes to meeting new people. I dont know why and how I developed this fear. I get so anxious when I am around new people. Even when I tell my few close friends lt  they all tell me that I look so calm and they would have never thought that I felt so uncomfortable being around new people. I try to hide it as good as I can. Work is keeping me busy and the little spare time I have I use for keeping myself fit. I run a lot like  times a week depending on my mood each k . miles at least. Most of the time late during the night or early morning. I dont belong to any running clubs since they arent any in my city. I spend a lot of time alone except at work but thats all superficial.

The vary from town to town because of local laws.  But most lap dances involve touching....lots and lots of touching.  The woman will basically straddle you and ride you with your clothes on.  But the dances can feel very affectionate too.  Theyll turn around and put their back against your chest and their hair will fall in your face.  I mean sometimes theyll caress your cheek or chest or whisper in your ear.  I think a lot of strip club patrons are FA types who go just to get a little intimate contact.

3098286,0,t1_coitux4,Who explained that to you? Be honest was it someone on this sub?There are many differences between a significant other and a friend. I generally dont send my friends texts in the middle of the day just to say I love you. I generally dont reminisce with my SO about drinking days or ask brutally blunt questions about her love life. The way I talk to my friends and the way I talk to my girlfriend are different plain and simple. Pretty much everything from the contexts we hang out in to the things we like to do together are very separate. I try to spend as much time as I can with my SO because were trying to build a life together  my friends on the other hand are also critical to my life and my happiness but we all understand that we have our own lives to live so its more of a well pick up where we left off last time sort of scenario. Everyone handles friends and SOs differently but there is no healthy mindset in which an SO is just a friend you have sex with. Havent you ever heard the term friends with benefits? Its dramatically different from being a significant other. There are clearly some other differences you are either overlooking or simply not familiar with.I didnt always have this. My first few brushes with dating were unbelievably catastrophic and I did not lose my virginity until several years later than most of my peers. I was always very awkward in high school and I struggle with social anxiety and chronic depression to this day. The point where my life started to turn around was when I started to talk to women  and not in a wouldwould not have sex context. In a listening context. So many of my closest friends are women and they are NOTHING like the women you claim are the default. I think that meeting these people and finally allowing myself to talk to women without all of these layers of expectation Does she want to have sex? Do I want to have sex with here? Are we going to have sex? When should we have sex? How do we have sex? I was able to pull myself out. My SO is the most beautiful woman Ive ever met  but the first girl I dated certainly was not. She was just fun to be around and I was fun to be around for her. Same thing with the first girl I ever had sex with yes they were different my first girlfriend and I dated for nearly half a year and never had sex we were both too scared and it was just more fun to hang out. But these experiences helped me build a foundation  a foundation I never would have had if I hadnt let my guard down lowered my standards and stopped being so unhealthily obsessed with sex and who was having it.,ForeverAlone,coj4wsq,5,t5_2s3yz

3350503,0,t1_cpa2yki,Except the results youre expecting are based on an ideal that looksmatching still works for men. Youre in the age of hookup sites and social media where women who are s are complimented like they are s. Go look at some GW subs and see the below average women being worshiped. And while young those women would go for NSA sex with slightly better looking males who wont commit rather than looksmatch an ugly male who wants a relationship with them. And you cant blame them for it really if they have access to NSA sex with better quality males than their looksmatched ones why not go for it?You keep spamming the sub about guys here being delusional and out of touch with reality yet its you who seem to be unaware of how the scene really works. Yes there are males who are deluded about their looks and chances but there are far more on the opposite sex except that those s who think they are s do get with guys who in your ideal setting should be out of their league.. just without the commitment. Most young sexually active women would rather be the side fuck of a guy above them on your scale rather than a LTR with a looksmatched guy unless he was exceptional in other ways. Get this fact into your aspie mind and internalize it before constantly spamming your looksmatched shit on the ugly guys on this sub like youve discovered the solution to all the subs problems. the problems we face that prevents many from getting women are  not as simple and linear as you think.,ForeverAlone,cpa6kki,5,t5_2s3yz

I will be honest with you no idea if you are a guy or a girl anyway I guess part of it is jealousy reprehensible and nasty as it is. That the girl will have had her first kiss at  lost her virginity at  or so...and heres me at  with nothing. That plays a vanishingly small part in it though. Truthfully though I have trouble thinking of hobbies girls like that I do too. Tennis golf football...guy sports. Dodgy bars...guy pasttime. Wine...male interest. Koestler Huxley Suetonius Dostoyevsky Emily Bronte looking at the last five authors I read on my kindle...reading is a singular past time. Traveling? My job takes me to places like Guatemala Kuwait Iraq the Congo. Holidays? Last two Ive run the marathon des sables Morocco and treked to the lost city of Teyuna in Columbia. Girls arent really interested in that sort of holiday. I love a guy who travels means travelling to Venice Bermuda New York etc.  For me a beach in the Caribbean or going to Venice just doesnt appeal. I think what i am trying to say is that you are quite correct that I should broaden my inerests.

3670380,0,t3_32bkxg,Ive been treated like shit by women my entire life.  Verbally bullied in grade school because of how I look and theres no fighting back as a boy other guys never messed with me.  Over the years Ive found women are quick to judge and assume things about me without ever really getting to know me.  If you are an ugly male most women will treat you like shit or if theyre not doing that they will use you.  I mentioned this earlier but Ive seen the way women react to better looking guys in the same situations and the difference is night and day if I were at least average looking Id probably hold a different perspective but my experience with women in my life has been overwhelmingly negative.  Consider this.  Imagine a girl grows up in an environment where every man has been abusive her father every guy she went out with eventually she grows a mistrust or dislike you can call it hatred if you please for men.  Could you blame her?  I wouldnt.  I used to be a nice guy a hopeless romantic now I just dont care and generally avoid women.

Condoms are never  so look to reduce the likelihood of your partner being infected in the first place.  Also it is morally wrong to take advantage of people who have very little choice in the matter.More expensive escorts are often independent but work with agencies to get clients.  They are more discriminating violent clients can get blacklisted and are more likely to take care of their health and appearance.  Just treat them with respect even if  you are paying them for sex.  Presumably you want a GFunpaid fuck buddy one day so maybe practice the sort of sex youd like to have with them on her  you know a bit of neck kissing and fingering and clit play dead giveaway of a selfishinexperienced lover is ignorance of the clit and stuff rather than just pounding at her.,ForeverAlone,cr9x1pb,2,t5_2s3yz

3984351,0,t1_cracldo,Are there really that many patrons of rForeverAlone who have decent jobs and careers? I have a feeling that most are in a variety of lowtomiddleranking types of work. Some will be decent certainly but most will be just about bearable and not very well paid by regular standards.Whats certainly true is that any job that pays almost any kind of wage is enough for an FA person to live pretty well.I have a terrible mindnumbing deadend office job thats going nowhere and pays the kind of salary that an yearold student would consider to be mere spending money but it suits me perfectly. With no other half no friends no social life of any kind its all available for paying the bills and everything left over is for me. I dont even spend most of my spare money and it just mounts up. I never do any of the copious amounts of overtime that are always on offer because I financially dont have to.Its one of the few real boons of the FA life. Work a shitty lowpaid job and eat caviar every night if you want to. NB I dont drink or smoke. I treat myself to a new computer once every two years but otherwise have no expensive hobbies. I literally just go to work and come home and watch TVread books. YMMV as they say.As for the social skills involved in getting that shitty lowpaid job in the first place there might be overlap between those skills and the skills required to have a relationshipfriends but theyre not the same set of skills at all.I can look an adult person in the eye in the context of a workplace interview and bullshit for ten minutes about the absolute pride I would take in providing a professional customer service blah blah blah etc.  and thats usually enough Ive found. In that context Im being a character and that character is the best interviewee of the day and its an easy one for me to play.Move over to the context of meeting people socially though where the character I have to be is myself and everything changes. So theres no contradiction at all IMO between somebody having a job of some kind and being FA. Having a job and the capacity to live independently of the world is the only reason Im still alive and relatively sane.,ForeverAlone,crag9fc,5,t5_2s3yz

Oh well another rejection at least I got to kiss a woman which was nice.Surprisingly enough next morning I got a text from her asking about something we talked about the night before.

Step one is making yourself more interesting on your own step two is male friends step three is female friends step four is a relationship. ,ForeverAlone,cucwdx3,1,t5_2s3yz

They have totally different cultures and values. You cannot sit there and tell me that whites and blacks have the same culture and actually be serious about it. Black culture can be very intimidating to outsiders. They have loud obnoxious and often very violent music flashy clothes and jewelry they talk loud they swear up and down and they are often rude.

5349036,0,t3_3o90hv,Here is my perspective as someone who has been chronically depressed for most of my life.You have a purpose which is INTRINSICALLY tied to the sadness that you feel you cant separate your purpose in this life from the sadness because the sadness begets the purpose and it becomes the fuel you need to succeed in that vision. If you kill yourself that passion will PASS ON from you to another person meaning the sadness doesnt go away you merely dump it on someone else and if that person kills themselves as well? The sadness will keep on linking across generations you have the chance to make a stand and to take in all of that that sadness and misery within yourself which will make the proceeding generations happier because nobody will need to take on that particular cross anymore you will have already done it. SOMEBODY has to make that brilliant invention that makes the proceeding inventions easier and necessity is the mother of all invention as they say people saw the suffering in humanity and so they innovated. You are a part of this you hold some brilliant innovationartcontribution that will make the proceeding contributions easier. Dont kill yourself because youre just giving someone else your vision which is yours your purpose with all of the sadness that comes with it... the two of these are companions that can never be severed. Somebody is going to take your place because the world allows people to fall to where you are somebody who sees this imbalance will have to set things right again but the first stage in this journey is to feel the pain and sadness and to realize its no place for future generations to fall into.    Furthermore I understand that creativity is hard when depressed but that doesnt mean this will be be true indefinitely... it may very well be the case that most of us will need a lifetime to compile the knowledge or capacity to fulfill the vision and then perhaps within few years of that it will finally bear fruit. ,ForeverAlone,cvveebb,3,t5_2s3yz

5397199,0,t3_3ouvij,Honestly Im going to let technology solve this one. FA seems to becoming a larger and larger epidemic throughout the world. Ultrawesternized countries are experiencing it at a rapid rate. Many young adults in Japan SK Scandinavian countries Germany US and Australia are realizing they are FA. This trend will grow exponentially as technology becomes more ubiquitous and as more people grow up without ever knowing times without the internet.I predict that perhaps this is either a selfregulating measure perpetuated by the human organism in order to stave off overpopulation a government conspiracy created in order to eliminate the deepest of thinkers by having them dwell on themselves being FA or perhaps an alternate theory altogether. All in all I think we will hit a critical point in about  years where this problem will be solved. Either by an implantable oxytocin device which will emulate feelings of love or some sort of simulation which will allow for virtual friends. Or conversely there will be an ability to switch of the desire to need to be with other humans. Anyway excuse my tangent.

The superlative of manly man was created by guys not women. I agree we have social issues as men but like I said I think we can fix those things ourselves. Women on the other hand are hurt more systemically like thru laws and also have social issues that both women and men have helped create. Those laws are by in large thought of and enacted by men.

In the end the only things that brought me any measure of joy or satisfaction either came about because of a combination of impulsiveness and dumb luck or because I joined something for the simple reason that I wanted to do it for me because I thought it was fun. And almost always the clubs and groups I joined because I wanted to do it rather than the ones I joined because I wanted to network were the ones that gave me what I was originally after all along.Moral of the story? Most people have no idea what they mean when they say try harder. Forget their bullshit selfmotivational advice it really is bullshit drop your expectations and fears of what your life should be like and go out and do whatever you damn well want to do.

5977140,1,t3_3x949a,I do that myself with similar results but I dont consider myself bad looking or obese. I mean my basic standard to reply is pretty simple A chick should not have an utterly repulsive face or obviously weigh more than me. Should be easy enough right? Yet my success rate online and in person has been very discouraging. Some of it is bound to be economic Im kinda just starting my adult life after a long stint in college and some of it is structural not enough women are on these sites for the men who go there.Sometimes Ive had absolutely repulsive people message me. Im talking about women who are obviously mentally or physically handicapped in wheelchairs  pounds overweight crosseyed really bad teeth etc... Initially I replied to be nice to these people but considering that I could never ever want to meet them I felt it best to just ignore them instead. I normally reply to people who are fairly ordinary even if Im not attracted to them but I wont waste time with people who are so far from what I want like that.Anyway my thinking about this is no you probably cant change what you find attractive physically. To me attraction is somewhat like being hungry. As you get hungrier your thinking about what would satisfy you changes. Maybe you hate mashed potatoes and would much rather a juicy steak or pizza but when youre hungry enough it will actually taste better. Rocks however will never taste good to you. What they say about beauty being on the inside is true but having someone you can be at least basically physically attracted to is very important for romance. I dont consider physical standards in romance shallow unless theyre uncommonly high like insisting that a guy be much taller etc.. Sometimes you just have to say hell no! lol,ForeverAlone,cy34uia,0,t5_2s3yz

6201338,0,t1_cyuduzz,Well it started at age  when I realized I had no real friends and was significantly behind socially. As far as lack of success with women I knew it was my personality since Im pretty average looking. I basically became a lot more conscious of my interactions with other people. I paid attention to when things I saiddid went over well or not. I stopped being so negative. I found a style of humor that worked for me which is very important for men.I made sure to treat people with respect but only when it was mutual people who use you dont actually like you. I cut out the people who didnt respect me or who didnt add happiness to my life. I took women off of the pedestal which is hard when FA. I always joined things if invited I think this one is important. I developed hobbies beyond computers and games brewing beer pottery gardening. I respectfully disagree with uCrystalLogic below gaming might not attract women but that doesnt mean that all nonshared hobbies dont help.At age  now  I considered myself more or less a normie. It took me  years so again not really a snap and I dont see how I could have done it any faster. Improving my social skills was also something that picked up momentum over time so it definitely got easier towards the end. I also know that if I hadnt made the conscious effort I wouldnt have made it out it wasnt luck in my case.Im not claiming that this is the solution for everyone as the source of FA varies but social skills are important none the less.,ForeverAlone,cyuixtt,12,t5_2s3yz

6929323,0,t3_4amphd,Hi there! Just wanted to say that you look great from your photo I am male and I too have alopecia universalis since my early twenties  Im  now and I can relate to how much it sucks not having any hair such as eyebrows and eyelashes which also help keep sweat and dirt away from the eyes. Though I imagine it must be worse for you since women rarely lose their hair. Regarding makeup I personally think it is a bit unfair that men cant apply makeup to cover up skin problems eg alopecia bad acne like women can. While women with such problems can cover them with foundation wigs and other accessories men with such problems cannot do any of that lest they be labelled insecure or unmasculine. For example I have been called such by my family by just putting on fake eyebrows to look a little like my old self again. My advice to you is if you like wearing makeup keep on doing it since its acceptable for women to wear makeup in our society especially to ease the social burden of medical conditions like yours.However I also think you look great without hair and if you want to go without makeup and wigs do it! If you do be honest with other people about your condition upfront that you are not sick and have a condition called alopecia universalis. You can even use it to your advantage eg you dont need to shave  wax anymore  a lot of guys I know would think thats awesome.,ForeverAlone,d11rieq,11,t5_2s3yz

7039991,0,t1_d1e6q9f,Yeah I might have been a bit too vague in trying not to make a wall of text as is my habit.Heres an example of what I mean Lets say that I have a coworker who is very confident. Were equals and each of us has an idea about how to do something. I present my idea and he presents his. Now my idea might be bettermaybe I feel very strongly that it is and maybe my idea is based on a lot of preparation that I did. But his idea is going to have him presenting it. He sells it with charisma and without doubts. When I make my presentation Im nervous and I come off as boring in comparison. I seem less assured that my idea is going to work. Which idea wins? The better idea or the idea that came from the selfassured person?And of course this could just as easily be a story of me and a more confident man being interested in the same woman. The problem is I leave these types of experiences feeling small. I hate that feeling and I dont want to be the type of person who makes others feel that way. And see to me thats the problem with the guy who fakes confidence. He comes in knowing that his job is to make the other guy feel smallthat he can use that to his advantage. The guy who has innate confidence goes up against the other person without really thinking about how he makes the other person feel. He wins because hes always won. Hes a winner. The guy who is faking confidence knows that he wins by taking the other person down. Thats why hes the worst.

7169172,0,t1_d1s06r5,Well when i was still in my lateteens and suffering extreme anxiety problems. I literally wouldnt leave my room for months. Hell i stayed in my room for over  years at one period. Eventually after i turned into a full fledge FA i just gave up. I didnt take showersclean myself up.. I just didnt care which ironically eased up my anxiety problems. I wasnt afraid to go outside anymore but i still suffered from it. Eventually i started working in my dads restaurant as a cashiercookeverything. The cashier girls were suddenly interested in me and i do mean the attractive ones. I literally turned into spaghetti. Obviously i was extremely cringeworthy... hell i even had one girl wanting to leave her bf for me. I eventually mannedup and asked one of the girls out and she said yes. I felt so eurphoic but this feeling wouldnt last long as she eventually cheated on me because of how i was. After this experience i told myself. Hey girls do like me.. The internet was wrong.. After years and years of reading about whitemen telling me girls dont like asian guys Im beta girls only like thisthat i actually started to believe it. I literally took every meme as a FACT. I had a distorted view on reality. I started kinda using my online persona irl. I like to trolljoke around a lot so i used that to my advantage but the positive thing for me was the fact Im naturally a good speaker i connect with people very easily as i been told Im charmingfunny. I would put friends in uncomfortable situation.. I just literally stop caring what people thought of me.  Because i notice everything i read online from FA to gaming forums. Every guy who claims to have a  inch cock every guy online claims hes ..Every guy consider himself a player.. Every guy claims he coldapproaches no problem and hes CHAD. Hes rich hes something of value. Where are these guys? Majority of men i know never hit on girls EVER. Normies date within their comfort zone which is from their social circles. Majority of men are scared and are not very direct. Majority of men are NOT GOOD LOOKING so are the women. Once i came to this realization i was set free.. My mind was free. Im no longer FA and dont ever want to be one again. ,ForeverAlone,d1t2g26,3,t5_2s3yz

I guess once it was established that I was indeed a competent employee I was given a choice to be hired on full time as a repairman. I took the position obviously but it is harder work. Long hours in a hot dehumidified room wearing a respirator the entire time because of the chemicals we use.

Personally I think if you have never been rejected explicitly over an over again when you approached women and through online dating you arent FA. To me being FA is about being rejected Explicitly. Not about never having someone. But I understand why people disagree with me. I dunno maybe take a poll here about who here has actually tried. Obviously really good looking guys have no probkems dating even if they have a lot of social anxiety so looking good helps. But maybe its not the only thing. ,ForeverAlone,d2pa9v2,1,t5_2s3yz

7488320,0,t1_d2r6ni8,So youre asking for examples of interesting stuff? In the context of a conversation it depends.I will say that its a bit alarming that you dismiss subjects as broad as science that can encompass hundreds of talking points where new things are discovered all of the time as dull and repetitive. Unless youre just stating how you personally feel about them since neither of us certainly speak for everyone other than those who agree with what were saying? If thats the case then.. ok? Good for you then that you have opinions and a general level of curiosity towards that differs from mine and likely the average person as well?Now that I think of it if I responded with examples I bet a testicle that youd react in a biased manner towards my replies under the belief that I must believe Im some sort of Einstein because I insulted some guy who sounds like a stupid douche on the internet even if Im lame for picking on an easy target meh.. Whatever I say youd likely be prepared to brand as not that interesting just to be a pain in the ass and prove me wrong. I could list anything and youd crucify me. Theres no point it wouldnt matter how you perceived what I found interesting because as I said its all subjective circumstantial etc.Id rather just agree to disagree if anything about whatever it is that youre trying to argue with me about.,ForeverAlone,d2tdqzw,1,t5_2s3yz

Im so grateful for my dad. He bucks the norms. Its my American Mom that acts like you describe...just out of it and then really angry. Perverse. Like she resents being forced to have children even though she shat them out. There are things I hear of about immigrant parents that are considered mental illness here but when every girl in your class who is a first generation immigrant says the same...you wonder.

I have a good smile and I can take a great picture but the picture doesnt tell the whole story. When women meet me in person they see a bad posture awkward stature and any number of features which arent accurately conveyed in a dimensional photograph.Ultimately its very hard to get someone to be honest with you about why they dont want to go out again or arent interested.  times out of  I was just ghosted after the first date. In some rare cases women would say I just didnt feel any chemistry or something similar. Nobody ever came out and said Look youre just much uglier in person than you are in photos which I came to learn from sheer experience was the actual truth.Even dates that resulted in great conversation and shared laughter did not warrant a second outing in my case. Importantly though I never TRIED to deceive anybody. I wasnt taking headshots from strange angles in dimly lit rooms with Instagram filters. On the contrary I intentionally went out of my way to do everything I could to make sure that when I drove to meet this woman and bought her dinner she would know in advance the person she was meeting.

Go to the zoo for example watch an aquarium go through the towns square and watch performers.

Important distinction.

8045154,0,t1_d4k2ffm,No one is normal. Thats the first thing everyone needs to realize. We all have our pains embarrassments issues and shortcomings. Calling someone a normie is just needlessly setting them above you. They dont understand your pain. Yeah. But there are people who appear normal who arent. And you might not fully get their pain. No one is superhuman and no one is subhuman. If you choose to accept that a normie is above you then he will be and you will not escape being forever alone. I am a  year old person who is facing the forever alone tag himself. I came to this group looking for ways to accept my likelihood of being forever alone. To make it bearable. To learn how to accept and find ways to enjoy life. But I seem to see a lot of selfloathing going on. This does not serve except to torture you. Ending the forever alone condition is beyond my knowledge but I do not want feel humbled. I want to find ways to improve my lot even if I remain forever alone. I have no friends and my only relationship was more than  years ago. If I die in my house my dog will eat me because there is no one to wonder where the fuck I am. I work from home so they wont care for at least a week of wondering if this is the week I took vacation. So I have at least a passing understanding of being alone. But the people with friends and active social lives are not normies They are have there own things that terrify them or trap them in some sort of pit they dont feel they can escape. Whos to say its worse than what is faced in this community? Id rather be alone than be a victim of spousal abuse emotional or physical or someone who has to get laid a lot just so they can look in the mirror and think they are worthy.If this sounds like an admonishment I dont mean it to. I just want to say that we are only as weak as let ourselves be.

That people who dont get lucky with the genetic dice roll have no inherent value and should just kill themselves so the attractive among us dont have to look upon them?

This is absolutely not a date. Im sorry to break it to you but you have very little to gain and everything to lose by trying to make a move on her I would absolutely not advise it. She knows that you feel awkward and have no experience with dating. If she wants to date you shell lead you into it and shell make the first moves. Dont assume anything people making moves on girls who are just being nice to them is partially why so many girls are wary about guys. So yeah. Sorry but this sounds like its just platonic and if it isnt then shell lead because she knows its unlikely you will. I dont think you can ask her to be your first kiss either thatd be pretty awkward and might ruin your chance to make a genuine friend. Basically Id assume that youve made a genuine friend which is fantastic and hopefully youll progress to meeting other people through her. If she wants a relationship shell initiate it and unless she does you should just be grateful that shes being nice to you and try to be a good friend back and hopefully shell be able to introduce you to other people and youll get more confident slowly until youre happy wit social interactions and have a good circle of friends.

Of course it helps having some sort of external positive reinforcement it is what self esteem is built on. When you have nothing but negative reinforcement there is no self esteem to base it on. At least for me whenever I even try to have some confidence I immediately think If you were X and Y why then are you turning  next month and still FA? I have tried. And got ghosted ghosted and ghosted again. Therefore just gave up. Anyway just wanted to vent andor rant a little bit. Please do not take it as an attack or anything like that it is nothing of that sort. I do like your attitude as it seems to be different than that of most chads who probably see us as less than human beings.

Hell Im  and Id rather intern now. Id make about as much fucking money Id learn more and Id enjoy myself. When I was ageappropriate I was not ready. Now...well Im probably going to pay for this till Im dead. You dont need a psychologists. Fuck psychologists. If your doctor wont give you medication go to a psychiatrist before your insurance coverage runs out.How old are you?If you worked and feel good about your resume that counts for a lot. If you have experience in the stupid things often asked for in jobs they only want to train you so much it matters.Its time to  go to career services the toastmasters society or other subreddits than can talk about about this.I had horrific anxiety most of my life and still do because Im ugly and acne at away at my face but with makeup I look employable.Heres how a recent interview wentI switched back and forth between eye contact with the temp agency interview smiled periodically and gave a rehearsed rendition of how my resume matched the jobs they were asking for. Meaning if you did x in a lab that qualifies you for a job you saw onlinetalk about it. If you know how to do y sort of analysis listed in the job you wanttalk about it. She stupidly and pointlessly asked at the end. Have any weekend plans? I lied. I said something Im doing in the next month a street fair or a movie festival. Lie about anything. Lie about going to the movies with friends. Lie about an event you saw on facebook. Lie and say youre going to the zoo since there are Halloween events.  Lie about going to a younger cousins birthday wax poetic about himher. Lie about brainstorming Halloween ideas with friends you havent seen in a while. They dont care. Interviewers get nervous too. Or rather thats the nice way of thinking of them. It is impossible for a human being to keep sustained eye contact the whole time.If career services is too general go ask a professor whose class you did well in for help and tell them Im looking for work and I really need interview practice.And in the processif you currently have health insurance then for the love of God find a psychiatrist and look up their reviews.I chose my psychiatrist bc he refills my meds in  minutes.

9233755,0,t1_d8mb3g7,First off evolutionary trends are more epistemologically clear than sociological ones so I I dont know what you are calling mysterious. Second You are conflating very really specific examples with a general rule. Yes in the past and in some places today such as Mauritania have held an ideal for female beauty that was fatter than today. However these have always been physiques that mimic pregnancy since necessary body weight for childbirth was a bigger deal when food wasnt a given. However these ideals where never obese and you do not find this preference in any developed or even middle income nation. Status has always been tied to female perceptions of male attractiveness in every society at every time. Now in a modern economy that status is very strongly tied to productivity and wealth. Changing that isnt as easy as writing a bunch of articles saying otherwise. You would have to change the whole economic system and I dont even think that would be a good thing. I have studied plenty of history art and literature you lack of specific examples to back up any of your claims make me doubt that you really have though and I am very widely travelled specifically in nonwestern rd world countries since that is where my family is from. Trying to convince everyone that they should find you attractive or else they are close minded will not work. I wish it would.,ForeverAlone,d8mg2eb,6,t5_2s3yz

Women get to reap the benefits of having men after them during their s. Even in their s. Even with being ignored getting older they still have men willing to sleep with them. Its FAR from being as divided as it is for guys in their s that arent chads. Its funny. The argument of men having no standards. Most women always turn this into tinder doesnt count. Men have no standards and will have sex with anything when it benefits their argument to men have such high standards. Entitled to models. Even ugly men whine about looks but only consider models!!

Reading your posts has made me realise that perhaps personality is not as all important as I used to believe  at least not until you have overcome the initial hurdle of attracting a partner and you are beginning to lay the foundations of a relationship with them. The second reason is a bit more personal someone I love is FA late s NEET never leaves his bedroom  and by learning more about this problem I am hoping I can... I dont know.

9789710,0,t3_5fdts3,Unfortunately even if people were busting down the door to meet you chances are no one will ever really understand you. I think one of the reasons some people cant get into relationships is because of unrealistic expectations not saying you are being unrealistic. For me once you get past the puppy love relationships are nothing more than maintaining said relationship with that person out of fear of being alone or starting again. So no matter how social and normal someone is most relationships fall into loveless attachment out of fear of being alone or they meet a messy end. I think because us loners dont get the chance to be in many relationships we tend to romanticize them more than anyone else. I dont deny its better than loneliness just not too the degree that i have to stress. ,ForeverAlone,dajsm25,4,t5_2s3yz

9792033,0,t1_dajrat1,Im not explicitly trying to find anyone a partner... I guess I want to help my friends just meet people. I was hoping the experience would show Ben that you can meet girls you can talk to them you can get some practice and comfort with it make a new friend or acquaintance etc. Its x harder to meet a girl cold and out in the wild... it helps tremendously to have a mutual friend set it up. If a spark is there thats great but Im not trying to be a matchmaker. I actually told Ben a few times that he and Anne probably wouldnt be a great couple for reasons unrelated to the quality of either of them. As for the friends thing... I actually think the ability to have platonic female friends is important. Ive always had a pretty solid number of close female friends many of them attractive. It completely takes the pressure off talking to a cute girl as its something you do all the time. Its socially validating and helps you meet even more girls. You learn a great deal about girls through your friendships. And frankly they just make really good friends. I do recognize that it might be really difficult for an FA person to befriend a girl without getting a crush though  thats pretty much exactly what happened with Ben. I guess its like dying of thirst and then being told you should look at the water instead of trying to drink it. As for whats in the way... hes something of an oversharer and will reveal personal things about himself to someone he doesnt know very well or when its not very appropriate. He talks a lot without really gauging whether people are interested  often hell go off on a topic that pretty obviously excludes people from the conversation. Hes argumentative even when he clearly knows less than other people in the discussion and thinks hes being playfully contrarian when he actually is kind of annoying.

Motivation is always temporary and will fail you sooner or later. When you stop feeling good or start feeling sadness or depression the motivation dies out and you go right back to your bad habits. Discipline stays when you feel great and when you feel miserable and low. Once you have it life becomes incredibly easy.Practice small. Deny yourself a piece of candy you normally would have eaten. Force yourself to take a cold shower every now and then. Dont let yourself hit snooze when you wake up. Shut your phone and computer off for periods of time. Have a no Netflix or no video game night. Meditate. Basically practice denying yourself things you want practice making yourself uncomfortable and practice forcing yourself to be bored. Start small and gradually build up. ,ForeverAlone,damuh61,3,t5_2s3yz

I think that as a man if  you put yourself into situations where there are girls in your age range  a few of those girls are attracted to you and  you make some effort to pursue those girls you will end up in a relationship even if you are rather inept in your efforts. My impression is that guys end up FA usually because they fail on point .  If girls arent attracted to you knowing the actual nuts and bolts of the courting process wont help much.

10096393,0,t1_dbnhega,I dont know if you care about whether your advice is wellreceived or not but can I make a few suggestions? Saying someone is immature is like calling them racist. It rarely leads to a productive conversation. It makes them defensive and when you start your advice with making someone defensive they stop looking inward and thinking about how your perspective could help them and look for ways to argue against everything you say.  Telling someone theyre not as smart or as mature as they think is even worse clearly. Youre setting up a dynamic here where instead of being the listeners equal you suggest that youre his better. You purport to want to help him but actually youre demonstrating that you think he is weaker than you and youre doing it in a public forum which means that he is going to interpret it as you trying to make him look inferior. Again very little selfreflection or thoughtful reasoning is going to come from this discussion. Again with the soon to fly out of the nest businessyoure belittling him. It isnt that everything you wrote is absurd and wrong but if you want to help people its worth considering how to deliver the message in a way that its going to be wellreceived and lead to meaningful introspection rather than anger and defensiveness. You might say that its up to him how he takes it but the same is true of punching someone in the face. Some guys will run. Some guys will punch you back. Some guys will try to reason with you. But there is nobody who gets punched in the face and thinks wow I really had that comingI should probably not have hit on his girlfriend.

You could have been the only woman in the world who was able to make those guys feel safe enough to be able to share their feelings with you. Not only that but you were independent and openminded enough to see things from their perspective and recognise their positive traits. I really dont believe you have anything to be ashamed of. People like you are actually quite rare and... special in a meaningful way.I snooped on your post history and learned that you are only . I really dont want to trivialise your doubts and insecurities but I feel you may have quite a while before you need to seriously worry about being forever alone. I know people here are all about how looks are everything but I think thats a relatively extreme view. In my experience women as kindhearted and independent as yourself tend to stand out to the right person. In high school the right person is probably just too dorky and inexperienced to acknowledge it.gtObviously the selfies and such i post online are just of my face in good angles and shit. In real life Im overweight I dont really have the talent nor effort for make up I dont have cute girly clothes cuz they dont fit right on me. And I dont know what to do about it.So you have good angles? Youre halfway there. It takes time to feel comfortable dressing for your body type. I know people well into their twenties who still dont know how to dress and women in their thirties who cant makeup. Of course I am not even going to pretend that I know how to advise you on how to dress! I do know that there are quite a lot of young women in your position however.gtIm not trying to be rude. Im only being honest. I dont want children or anything. Im sorry but I had to laugh at this! No one is judging you for setting a chromosome restriction for your future boyfriend!gtI feel more alone than ever now. Listen. I know a lot of you out there may have never had anyone interested in you. Maybe Im also presuming so much but anyway. Wouldnt you choose no one to want to date you rather than ONLY special people to want to date you? Im sorry.Im sorry you feel alone. I have actually had women interested in me but I tend to have similar problems to you in that I attract people with mental problems or those who are too insecure to approach anyone else. Part of being a nice person is learning to stand up for your own requirements Ive never regretted turning down someone who I knew I was fundamentally incompatible with. The other part is knowing when to make your move and that is where Ive always struggled.You seem like a very sweet and compassionate person and I hope things will work out for you in the future ,ForeverAlone,dbwdfc1,17,t5_2s3yz

But one thing is true there is still a stigma about women who had a lot of partners albeit not as high as it used to be.That means for a woman its not a very good idea to be with someone youre not sure about. If she loses value for every partner she dates then its smart to wait for the one alpha rather than give a chance to the awkward boy.Its not nearly as bad as it used to be but I usually see on maledating inexperienced men oriented communities comments on how much theyre bothered by a womans past whereas the Chads dont give a fuck.

Being honest is telling someone you just got out of a  year relationship and want to take things slow.  You are not being dishonest by not telling someone this is your first time going on a date or kissing.  There is literally nothing to gain here.  You arent lying or being deceitful by not mentioning it.    If she asks you point blank then you can tell her.  Explain the awkwardness of the kiss on the drinks.

10586242,0,t3_5ri82m,So Im F and dating a guy whos  my height. Ive never given a shit about height but I can give you some thoughts from what Ive observed of my friends and some from my life.I think some of it is born out of uncontrollable attraction which is dumb kinda like the hipwaist ratio that rnotacreepyweirdo talked about and some of it is from insecurity. Just like men are told you have to be big and strong and manly or youre a piece of shit were told we have to be feminine and tiny and delicate or were a piece of shit. I think both men and women gain something from having partners who physically represent gender extremes because we seem extreme by comparison  having a male partner whos tall and muscular makes us feel petite by comparison. A lot of girls I know feel insecure when their partners are smaller because it makes them feel big.There is some interesting data basically showing that the overwhelming majority of men can overpower the overwhelming majority of women. Its pretty hard to explain how that feels  walking around looking at men knowing that almost all of them could overpower you if they chose to. Its not like its on my mind constantly but it is a background awareness and it does affect stuff.,ForeverAlone,dd7w1b1,7,t5_2s3yz

10898693,0,t3_5vpdeg,I agree with BitterIdiot that its not so much about that you should change its more about learning how to cope in society when you feel like you have some limitation or disadvantage. For instance if you had been born without the use of your legs and you were in a wheelchair some people in society may very well treat you differently. Some people would be patronizing to you or pity you or infantalize you. And if you were having a hard time dealing with those attitudes and behaviors from others it would be helpful to learn some techniques for coping. To make yourself feel better and not care as much about what other people think about you so that you can live your life the way you want to more freely. If some people were disgusted or felt pity for someone in a wheelchair then that would be fundamentally unfair and everyone else would need to be more accepting or considerate. But apparently human society is not as accepting or considerate as we would want it to be. So if a person feels shame or insecurity or other negative emotions as a result of peoples treatment then therapy is designed to help overcome those feelings. Its more about empowering yourself to deal with difficult situations. Of course all therapists arent good. But theres a wide body of knowledge out there about therapy and techniques to become more mentally healthy and strong. ,ForeverAlone,de44flx,10,t5_2s3yz

11516757,0,t3_648n4y,Ive been in the same boat all my life. I didnt commit suicide because of three reasons one Ive always been curious and want to see what happens in life. Two Im fairly learned and so aware that this life is the only window and access to the world that Ill ever have for all of eternity therell be no second show and so I dont want to waste it. Three I maintain the hope that my life might dramatically improve at some point especially if I keep trying to make it so.Thats been my philosophy for decades now. Im near retirement age now.A couple years ago I finally got a girlfriend for a couple months and it made me deliriously happy. Even after it ended the good it did me has persisted wonderfully.I still hope for more good things to happen before I die and continue to work toward realizing them.But the daily slog can be tough. I did it for decades. It took me quite a few years to find ways to make it bearable to the point that I wouldnt be totally despondent and miserable all the time.Ive always loved to read so reading books helped me tremendously. I couldnt have made it very long at all without that. They were Sam to my Frodo.I learned about how Nazi Death camp survivors used fantasy to make it through the experience and so maintain a robust fantasy life.I forced myself into the habit of helping others long ago and that helped to quell the worst of my social isolation pains now Im somewhat in demand and sometimes grateful to have some time alone believe it or not.Most of those others definitely wouldnt have been my first second or even third choices for associates if I could have had my pick of everyone in the world. But they dont have to be for me to get what I need to survive.Plus after many years of doing that it actually led to me having a satisfying platonic relationship with a young woman friend whom I DO like very very much.Helping those others plus doing my own plentiful chores also helps keep me distracted from many of the worst aspects of being FA and distraction can be great.I found staying fit and healthy helps me feel better too plus saves me money allowing me more financial freedom so I eat right exercise regularly and get sufficient sleep whenever possible. Other benefits include feeling more attractive to both myself and others plus being stronger and better coordinated. Heck Im definitely stronger and got more endurance right now than I had when I was ages  or so.I absolutely HAD to have an interesting life in order to survive. Anything less and I couldnt have made it. Just reading interesting books wasnt enough. So Ive done quite a bit too.Dont get me wrong my adventures and projects never brought me fame and fortune. However after decades of such stuff one of them DID shock the crap out of me by netting me that girlfriend for a couple months. Something Id always hoped would be a possible consequence of some of them.Ive learned a lot experienced a lot and become a much better person due to all of it.Those things also made me a bit of money here and there too which helped tremendously freedom wise. But still Ive had to be super frugal all my life to maintain that freedom.My lack of money severely restricted the sorts of adventures and projects I could undertake of course. But still I managed to find some which were doable and interesting. And years later wrote books about some of them as a project all its own and have made a little money that way too.Im a hard core FA survivor. And consider myself to have had a surprisingly interesting life to still be so impoverished and obscure in general. Compared to a great many of the posters I see here I seem to be downright prospering. But it does require tremendous effort discipline creativity and open mindedness to accomplish and feel halfway decent about yourself on a regular basis too.However it IS possible if you want it badly enough.,ForeverAlone,dg1fccz,1,t5_2s3yz

11571669,0,t3_653okh,Yes being in a small town and rarely meeting anyone new definitely puts a damper on things. Especially in finding those people who would be attracted to your specific pheromones.Pheromones are aromatic signals relating to the urge to reproduce which can act on us subconsciously but youll definitely notice it consciously too when you get a sufficiently strong reaction. Basically your nose tells you how close a prospective mates DNA is to the ideal one which when matched to your own would produce superior offspring immune system wise. Its evolution in action.Up close where people can detect your natural aroma your pheromones can act like gangbusters on any man attuned to your specific genes and help overcome many negatives. Well matched pheromones also make for maybe the hottest sex you can ever have. Trouble is finding the right other person for this.My best friend from high schoolcollege days learned about this early on and set up his life so hed travel widely and meet tons of people. That allowed him to find multiple ladies whose pheromones drove him wild so that he had a very satisfying for a man series of mateslove affairs.Pheromones arent necessarily the top factor in such things of course. But if the right guy gets close to you he might feel like its love at first sight. Unfortunately you might not feel the same.

11654714,0,t3_66b3a8,Have you done dating apps?  Tinder is great for avoiding the i cant ask a woman out thing because it makes it so simple.  You just get matched so you know theyre already kinda interested text back and forth a bit tell jokes and stories then ask if she wants to go out for coffee or something.  If she says yes get her number and text back and forth a bit and make plans within the next day or .  Then just have a simple date talk tell stories and jokes etc.  When youre done with coffee get up and give her a hug ask if she wants to go for a walk or something and hold her hand.  Walk around a bit and talk more.  When you feel the time is right like the situation feels romantic turn to her look into her eyes and say id like to kiss you and if she says yes which she certainly will if youre as dreamy as you say and you have been having a good date.  Kiss her a few times dont turn it into a makeout session.Then invite her back to your place.  If she says yes congrats youre getting laid or at least getting a handjob or something.Or if you feel like swinging for the other team you can just get on Grindr.  Its apparently super easy to pick up guys on Grindr.  Even if youre terrible at flirtingconversation just let them know that youre horny and want sex and youll easily have a penis in your butt by the end of tonight. p  Just make sure you use a condom for anal you dont wanna end up with HIV or herpes in your butt.Good luck buddy.Source  I was similar to you told im like a  or   lbs black hair green eyes nice facial features and this worked for me.  I was also super awkward and socially isolated growing up though more from years of bullying than something less soul crushing like being homeschooled.  You might have to try a few times before you get it to work with women but if you dont give up youll have success eventually.Also aim for women who are like  as far as rating if you want to make this easier.  It works better if youre more attractive.   of women want to be swept off their feet by some tall blonde hair blue eyed hunk if theyre a bit less attractive this happens far less regularly for them so theyll be less likely to pass up the opportunity when it does come their way.  ,ForeverAlone,dgh2rbh,5,t5_2s3yz

Blind fate not intention determines all events. Moreover the narrative questions the very decorum it praises. The tin soldiers passive acceptance of whatever happens to him while exemplifying pietistic ideals of selfdenial also contributes to his doom. Were he to speak and act the soldier might gain both life and love. Restrained however by inhibition and convention he finds only tragedy and death. The tale is often read autobiographically with the soldier viewed as symbolizing Andersens feelings of inadequacy with women his passive acceptance of bourgeois class attitudes or his sense of alienation as an artist and an outsider from full participation in everyday life.,ForeverAlone,dgkjjo7,15,t5_2s3yz

Just sleep together in the most innocent sense of the phrase. But I lacked the courage and she had a boyfriend and I was gawky and she was gorgeous and I was hopelessly boring and she was endlessly fascinating. So I walked back to my room and collapsed on the bottom bunk thinking that if people were rain I was drizzle and she was hurricane.

11748353,0,t1_dgrjkru,Its not a bad thing to just be honest about your lack of dating experience. If you say something like i gotta confess Im a little nervous about this date since I havent been on one in a while it is more likely to improve things. Youll have shared something personal which instantly creates a bit of bonding and openness between you two youll have spoken it out loud which I promise will take some of the pressure off and finally its a good test of your date. If he acts like youre a total loser for not being on a lot of dates maybe this is your fear but its extremely unlikely its his loss  hes a jerk and the relationship wouldnt work anyway. If hes nice hell be genuinely kind and understanding about it and might even be flattered or think its nice that you care enough about the date to be nervous and open enough to share it. Most likely scenario theyll say theyre kind of nervous too and it breaks the ice. You guys can laugh about it and bond and it creates an opening for conversation.

11762500,0,t3_67o4pa,The statement is bullshit and most people just mindlessly repeat it. However there are two truths behind it.  First of all it implies that you shouldnt rely on a relationship to make you happy. Because youre not really relying on a relationship but on another person. Another living breathing person with emotions and feelings. Making them responsible for your happiness in whatever way it may be is putting an unthinkable amount of stress on them which a isnt fair and b will probably quickly strain the relationship to breaking point. Partners should be equal.  The second truth is more complicated and complex. Simply put its in my experience somewhat unlikely that the lack of a romantic relationship is the ultimate cause for your unhappiness. Think of it this way If your throat hurts youre entirely right in saying it hurts because its inflamed. But the cause for that inflamation and thus your pain is an infection by bacteria or viruses. And if you want to heal you need to get rid of the pathogene not of your sore throat.  Yes youre unhappy because youre feeling lonely but the ultimate cause the pathogene is something else. Because believe it or not there are actually people out there who have been single and maybe even lived in solitude for years and are still happy.  The problem is that psychological issues are not related in such a linear fassion but more intertwined. A relationship realizing that someone can find you attractive and loveable can be a factor in healing psychological issues. It in itself wont fix them but it will give you a boost to overcome it.So I think ultimately this statement is true but for reasons more complicated than people think.,ForeverAlone,dgtb4ip,1,t5_2s3yz

11810157,0,t1_dgypne1,I dont think there are any blanket rules but as you admit anxiety or something else is likely playing a role in this situation and I think its a bit strange to pretend as if it isnt. Feeling anxiousscarednervous to the point where you arent able to do a particular thing that most people are able to do indicates that there is a problem. Its not a bad thing and is likely something anyone can overcome but it has to be acknowledged first.Ill give you a less emotionally charged example  I did not get my drivers license until I was  because I had really bad anxiety about driving. It made me super nervous I was tense I was constantly worried I would hit something or make a mistake. But thats okay. I got over it eventually but the important thing was understanding that yes anxiety was the problem. It wasnt because it was the first time I was starting to drive or because I was young or whatever because every yearold has those jitters and most of them still manage to get past them. It took me a little longer. Its alright not the end of the world but youve got to identify the problem before you can find a solution instead of just pretending its the norm when its generally not.I have every sympathy in the world for this girl  I treat physical intimacy as something very important. I also know there are a lot of men who will wait for intimacy for a long time so that the girl is comfortable  I managed to have a longterm relationship without losing my vcard. That said I think it would take a very special man to wait for a long time for handholding and thats why I think this is a problem that should be addressed for both of their sakes.I understood that you meant you would feel physically sick. It doesnt really change my opinion in my earlier comment.,ForeverAlone,dgyq0hh,1,t5_2s3yz
