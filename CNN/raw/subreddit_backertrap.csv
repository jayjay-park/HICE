3310434,0,t1_cp5lr30,If youre located in the UK you may be better off pursuing it in the UK Id ask a UK lawyer.  Also to clarify Im not providing legal advice or representation to anybody at this point. Triggertrap did agree to jurisdiction and venue in New York in their agreement with Kickstarter and Im pretty sure theyre going to be subject to jurisdiction in California as well.  But while getting a judgment shouldnt be too tough enforcing it in the UK where the company has lots of assets would be far easier than in the US.  My analysis is still in flux as triggertraps apparent ownership of the Vela high speed flash trademark  opens a new line of inquiry as to whether the failed Ada project is going to be opensourced and then used to support sales of the triggertraprelated Vela project.,backertrap,cp5m83v,1,t5_37a8c
3387820,0,t3_2y0d2d,Im here. Australian Top level backer .I put something up on kickstarter the other day about chipping in more to see the project completed but some good points have been raised about the lack of evidence that the project is actually anywhere near ready for manufacture combined with TTs reluctance to even engage in discussion down that line tends to make me feel even more that it is actually no where near ready for manufacture.I feel the only way to go now is to proceed with litigation Possibly class action but I have very little knowledge in the area.,backertrap,cpefsrj,1,t5_37a8c
3789235,0,t3_2y0d2d,I have received a refund from my bank following a chargeback claim. I would advise anyone who has paid via VISA or MasterCard to contact their bank if they havent already. Thankfully my bank seems to have interpreted the word refund to mean giving me back ALL the money I paid not Hajes farcical interpretation.,backertrap,cqo7ba5,1,t5_37a8c
