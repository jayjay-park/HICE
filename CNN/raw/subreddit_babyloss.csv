582646,0,t3_20t7di,I feel connected to you after my stillbirth my exhusband and I moved out of our house into a new rental about  weeks later. There were just too many memories of the pregnancy and the nursery. It was really helpful... we moved into a house that had a luxurious bathroom so we called the house our rehab house. Spent a lot of time trying to pamper ourselves and be gentle to ourselves there. I too quit my job about  months after my loss because it was hard to see small children babies I worked in a violin shop and many moms came in with their toddlers and babies in tow renting student instruments. I went to a more professional environment and found it extremely helpful too. Not to mention I made a new set of friends who knew my story from the start and admired me for my strength. It was nice meeting people who didnt feel awkward. They also took my mind off of things. On a side note the biggest major change happened a year and a half later when wed gone through another loss my husband decided he didnt want to go through trying to have a kid again so he left me. At the time it was devastating but it eventually led to my new life a new husband a rainbow baby. Not saying everyone should get divorced lol but just saying that major changes can be good things in the end. lt,babyloss,cg6i1sz,7,t5_2yt5k

1330441,0,t3_27r3ha,I say that I have  children. The twins are . Next one is  and my Angel would have been  on March . A friend of mine miscarried her first child early. She says she doesnt have children of her own but those of us who are close to her know that shes a mom even though she never met her baby. I think shes still uncomfortable talking about it with random people. Another friend says that she has  but  are Angels. Lost one of her identical twins at  months old and miscarried a year later. Shes very blunt. Its really a personal decision whatever youre most comfortable with. ,babyloss,cijaii8,3,t5_2yt5k

9016511,0,t3_53mra8,Im so sorry for your losses. Unfortunately you will probably never know why. That is one of the hardest parts for me is not knowing why. I had several miscarriages and lots of tests and there is no obvious reason why they didnt make it. I too felt really angry and sometimes still do. I did end up with one healthy pregnancy tho and have a lovely daughter so try not to give up hope there is always hope. Hugs x,babyloss,d7vn7f3,2,t5_2yt5k
