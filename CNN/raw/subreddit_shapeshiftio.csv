7312372,0,t3_4e93ms,Ive read what you have posted about the hacks.  You did not release very much technical information as is typical.  But from what Ive read you seem to not have much security expertise at your disposal.  You need that before you can ever hope to hire someone to practice security for you  because you will not be able to determine who is knowledgeable or not.Its as simple as that.You should be able to withstand at least one day and it should never have been possible to delete audit logs. I am consistently amazed at how bad the security posture of companys in this space are.  Theres not enough security talent to go around but the constant underinvestment in security posture blows my mind.  I cant figure out if its that people are arrogant and underestimate attacker capabilities or if its something else.Good luck!,shapeshiftio,d29d7vl,1,t5_34gpu
