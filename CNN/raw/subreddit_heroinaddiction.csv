9813860,0,t3_5co8x3,I dont know about D.C. But Baltimore is really easy to cold cop ... its just like philly corner boys everywhere if your in the right part of town take the subway .. there is only one line in Baltimore and get off at pennnorth or upton market station .. be warned it is hood as fuck ... I dont know if youve ever been to Kensington in philly .. you said your from pa ... but its worse ... but what you want is everywhere ... literally every corner ... just make sure you buy from an actual set and dont let someone buy it for you ....also its not the regular ecp you are used too ... most of the dope is what they call scramble ... very fluffy and if your shooting you have to cook it to break it down...also it is sold in plastic gel caps there not bags ... but the sets still name there dope even though its not in stamped bags ...also sometimes they will say they have raw . Witch just means regular ecp like from pa but most of the time they charge you more for it and its not as good .. of course there are exceptions to that rule ... be careful also ... there is a lot of crappy dope in b more but also a lot of really really good dope ......like really good ... Ive been all over the country and copped in a lot of places and to me bmore is the only place that rivals philly ... Camden used to but thats beat now.... hopefully you have general common sense and atleast some hood knowledge....just remember be respectful and dont be scared ...sets corner boys fiends will smell that shit the second you get off the subway.. but in reality your safe as long as you practice common sense ... but yeah bmore is home to like the second biggest open air drug market in the us ... so if you cant find it your an idiot .. pm me if you have questions,heroinaddiction,damrnq1,2,t5_36yk0
