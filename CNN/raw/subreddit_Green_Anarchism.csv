2583921,0,t1_cmvsunu,Sure resource is subjective. By decolonized I assume you mean primitive or uncivilized? Civilized folk might not see the equal resource value in a Yucca plant as a Native from the SW US civilized artists might see it as aesthetically pleasing a biologist might see it as a sign of a healthy ecosystem etc..
