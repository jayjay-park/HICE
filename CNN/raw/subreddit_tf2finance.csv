3881225,0,t3_34sh0k,You might want to ask this question on rtftrade theyd have a better idea.That being said though the TF economy has changed quite a bit over the years some things are still pretty constant. When you say the price of keys is rising thats mostly true in regards to refined metal. In terms of actual dollar amounts the price of keys is more or less kept in check by the fact that you can buy them from Valve for . apiece.What is more variable is the price of the hat youre looking at. I never did much with them myself but I know enough about the market generally that unusual prices drop over time. As an allclass item the Company Man is probably a bit higher in demand and thus price than a classspecific hat but over the course of a year Id still expect it to drop by how much exactly I have no idea.Hope that helps.,tf2finance,cqyoypz,1,t5_357nj
