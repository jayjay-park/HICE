9839497,0,t1_daq3kvw,What if you gained power from destroying tanks and the base is given a super slow regen?Besides if someone attacks me with too many tanks at the same time I can literally kill him with just a commander because he has too many houses. I have done this a few times. Even more so if he has very few generators because then hell run out of power if he chooses to rebuy.,bloble,daq3y96,1,t5_3hhhq
