5907465,0,t3_3vrxkz,I dont specifically remember this book from  years go and I sure dont remember the tv episode. However after reading it seemingly for the first time I do have to say the book missed several plot opportunities to make it truly great. Its really too bad! This was pointed out rather humorously in the podcast. Was is just me that found Dannys ghost confusing and superfluous? I know the guys made some pretty well intentioned  defenses on behalf of R.L Stinenot to infer that the Goosebuds are butt lickers in any way but was this only half of a great story?!I understand the audience it was written for and the time constraints of the deadlines I just wish this book was babied a bit more. It had a fantastic opportunity to share more cathartic moments about the metaphysical the carelessness of our actions and the consequences of them lets not forget the power of redemption.Maybe Im asking too much of old R.L. After all he is the man who taught me to read and kept me thirsty throughout my first decade and for that he has my deepest gratitude. Hes either a totally mediocre writer in tune with his audience or a genius who was sadly underestimating his audience. I cant really say which.,goosebuds,cxu02gx,1,t5_32kb4

I remember watching the credits once I learned that he worked on that show and I distinctly remember seeing that name and figuring that that must be him.,goosebuds,cynli4k,1,t5_32kb4

7071026,0,t3_4cfely,Hey Goosebuddies! Like I said in the intro this is something that theoretically we would do from time to time with other select books. I imagine things like Babysitters Club and Box Car Children would come up eventually. So let us know what else you think would be good to read and how ya feel it. ,goosebuds,d1hv42g,10,t5_32kb4
