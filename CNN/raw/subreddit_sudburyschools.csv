1614493,0,t3_2cl0nx,Im a staff member at a sudbury school so my experience is a little different. That being said I know the feeling  I was told I was ruining my own future when I chose not to be a traditional school teacher. We often hear similar woes from parents and families at our school here in Baltimore. Choosing to send your kid to a sudbury school is not only a radical choice but a brave one too. Its a choice for your entire family and explaining that to those who arent in the know can get sticky. In all honesty weve have families at our school who have lost friends for making the choice. I certainly have. I think those people arent worth keeping around. When it comes down to it youre making a choice with your child so that she can be happy. A person who thinks things like university and good jobs should come before happiness isnt the kind of person I would choose to be friends with. Unfortunately we dont always realize their opinions on that kind of thing until these conversations happen. Sometimes I think the problem can be simple naivety. Its a complicated model of education and it means something different to everyone who utilizes it. Its not something that can be explained in a nutshell. People say hurtful comments before they really understand. Ive learned a lot of patience since entering the sudbury world  even though sometimes I just have to realize I cant convince everyone and thats okay. Heres a great and short piece from Hudson Valley School on this topic  ,sudburyschools,cjio9dj,1,t5_2zgo4
