I used Excel Google spreadsheet wasnt cooperating for the formulas I wanted to use to calculate the average of the fastest   laps   laps and   laps depending on how many each driver finished.

340226,0,t3_1xzkqe,Ill take this oppertunity to apologise to terrrrrible for an incident during an overtake. If I recall correctly We were pushing into a corner and I got ahead but went a bit wide and on turning in I clipped your rear tyre and spun you out.I then tried to let you past since the overtake was so poor and we were on completely different pages and I basically brake checked you  Im sorry!I putted for inters on lap  I think and it was about  laps too early. S got wet quite quick but S and S were dry as a bone and I had to crawl in st gear while wrecking my tyres.I was on my nd set of inters before anyone else I think went onto their first. I took the gamble and it bit me for about a minutes laptime overall.Ended up getting SUPER lucky with the safety car in that I pitted JUST as it came out so I could cruise around the track catching up with the pack on fresh inters. Rained and rained and considered wets but so glad I didnt. Caught up to the pack JUST as the SC was coming back in for the perfect reset.A couple people spun in front so I clambered up the table and ended up chasing splendid who was about  seconds ahead but I was an entire lap down which was weird.Decided to not push to overtake and kept position. Finished th a lap down.tldr  Apologies to Terrrrible for the incident.Rain and Safety car saved my race after a horribly early inter pit.I am VERY happy with my race result.,VirtualWDCPC,cfg191w,3,t5_2tqjh

970711,0,t3_257qx3,Welp Im super happy with that result.  First win and second podium this season and hoping for more as we go  have to take the fight to the front runners!I went for a  stop strategy OPPP and used the Ferrari strategy of pitting a lap early for the undercut.  It allowed me to pull out some extra time on fresh tires but it also put me in a somewhat precarious position toward the end as I had to do an extra lap or so on the tires while Nemesis was charging forward with the options which meant I was pushing very hard and nearly stuffed it a couple of times.  Somehow managed to keep it together for the last stint and bring home a victory.Not too much action for me but I did have a bit of close but brief racing with a few people on different tire strategies Racedriver Bryan ian.  Jphill was keeping up very well at the end despite being a lap down and even unlapped himself for a moment when I got mixed up with I think SupMyKneeGrows while trying to get past as well.  Definitely a lot of talent all the way down the grid even if it isnt emerging quite yet.  There will be some very interesting races this season I think.EDIT Recording is here The start.  Not a lot out front but good action in the mirrors for a bit. Driving on cold tires is hard. Time to take on RaceDrivers patented teleportation technology. Find a battle between a Red Bull and a Ferrari.  Eventually try to stick myself in the middle of it.  Bryan pits and I have a DRS drag race down the front straightaway with ian. and  Frogger experiencing problems with his Williams power steering.  Hope his team can sort that out for him. Almost lose it while chasing down Bryan.  Finally catch him in sector  and overtake with DRS and KERS assistance. Bryan sees an advantage as I come out on cold tires and makes a move on the outside of turn  and then turn .  Almost makes it stick but I think he was on worn tires at that point. Nemesis begins his mind games.  Response wasnt recorded but it was Primes.  Why what are you on?.  I start pushing hard and nearly lose it several times over the next few laps. Come across jphill and he makes a mistake on cold tires.  Take the chance to pass him but he keeps up until I come across the next lapped car at   I mess up the exit of the hairpin while lining SupMyKneeGrows up for an overtake and we have some very interesting racing over the next few corners.  Turn  is very interesting indeed.OTHER EDIT I owe a lot of my performance today to ulordp.

I havent put many hours into it which is why Im bad at it but its fun and frustrating at the same time. There is a nice variety of car types that will only increase as time goes on. Not a lot of tracks but with the track modding tools they released we should be getting a lot more options there too.

2202135,0,t3_2kbn31,Full RaceWell that was miserable.  Without the wet TT this week I didnt do any wet practice so I had to guess at a setup before qualifying and got it all wrong.Then during the race I followed sandah into the pits on lap  since my wets were fairly worn not realizing that you only get  full wet tires in a race.

3050395,0,t3_2v3q1i,Can we run street circuits every weekend? After hearing about and reading everyone elses summaries this is about how my weekend went.I had really good battles on both tracks today and was really lucky to hold off Spectre and The Stonk on Monaco and Singapore. They were both consistently quicker than me by the end but I managed to keep the car wide and not allow them to make any moves stick. A few more laps and they both wouldve had me. Teamwork by Strike gave me the win in Monaco because I never would have made it past Spectre otherwise. Monaco Video  Started P and had a great start to jump Nemesis through T. I was stuck behind Spectre for another  laps after unsuccessfully undercutting him in the pits. Thanks to some serious help from my teammate I was able to pass Spectre and hold on to the position to the end. With Nemesis closing on us fast and my tires starting to fade I spent the last  laps doing the best I could to block apexes and make the car wide rather than taking the fast line. Fortunately I was able to make it work until the end.Singapore Video  Singapore qualifying in the wet was good to me as I took pole by nearly a full second. This advantage didnt carry over into the race however as The Stonk was never more than  seconds behind me the entire time. The last third of the race is where he really began to push as we traded positions more than a few times after lap . The final two laps saw us sliding around trying everything to make an overtaking move stick. At the end I managed to limp my way across the finish line just ahead of him but it was only a matter of time before he took first place for good.,VirtualWDCPC,coe66yg,3,t5_2tqjh
3057451,0,t1_coeviy4,Yeah the pad helps quite a bit in the rain although the difference isnt as big in intermediate wet as it is in full wet.

4454268,0,t3_3c4475,Welp.  After some debate midrace I decided to pit for primes from nd on lap  and hope that the rain would be light enough that we wouldnt need to switch to inters.  Was banking that  lap old primes would be faster on a wet track than  lap old options if Levis was trying to go to the end.  Its pretty clear how that turned out.Anyway great racing with Levis in the first stint and the last few laps gave me something to think about after coming out just a couple of seconds behind Nemesis.

10239436,0,t3_5ml6ii,What a race! Qualifying was very close but I had an second gap to blotto after he fought back to second. Blotto was slightly faster throughout the race and he went for the undercut in the first round of stops which probably lost me a second. I then ran wide coming out of the pits after the first stop costing me another  seconds at least. I was very surprised to see blotto get on the supersofts for the final stint as I was on the softs but turns out that I still didnt really know the tyre rules since they were changed ingame a few months ago.Thankfully I managed to only just stay ahead.

Make points something worth fighting for rather than a near guarantee. gt Otherwise the relative winners among the slower drivers such as myself will just be the people who happen to show up on the day where the fewest drivers arriveThis argument doesnt support your point of view at all. It applies just as much to a top  system as it does to a top  system.For me personally it doesnt matter if the top  or the top  gets points because I havent been outside of either since I joined this league.
