569940,0,t3_20lxal,Straddle lifts have always been my goto exercise to improve my jumps. If you dont know what these are  basically you sit on the ground in a straddle place your hands on the ground in front of you in between your knees. Then lift your legs up and down or in circles. Try not to lean back when you do it and it will also engage your abs. Kind of hard to explain but it is really great for isolating your hip flexor muscles! ,Cheerleading,cg522j2,2,t5_2r5ii

5010533,0,t3_3jjvvj,I think the problem might be with the way youre pulling your flyer. Imagine a power clean people assume that the arms are the main muscle used and as a result they assume that pulling to the chest adds that extra strength but neither is true. Guys instinctively pull towards the chest because that motion feels like it adds more power to the stunt. But you need to realize that you dont need as much strength as you think you do. Let your flyer do most of the work in the jump. I also have a couple ideas on what else the problem may be. If you dont mind sharing the video of your attempts.,Cheerleading,cupyj0k,2,t5_2r5ii
5053535,0,t1_cuv4djr,Ive found that a lot of guys I stunt with who are new to doing toss awesome have a floating claw hand instead of the high V. Im a girl so Ive obviously never based them but I can see how the hip would give you the stability and the UCA guys all prefer the cupie grip to awesome.,Cheerleading,cuv5594,1,t5_2r5ii
5068336,0,t1_cuwvels,No. An old teammate I didnt super get along with has them and wont send them to me ,Cheerleading,cuwxcd5,2,t5_2r5ii
7224856,0,t3_4ed1wv,I tried out for my schools team and made it without any experience. My coach later told me that it was because I had very good toetouches form and confidence. Be confident even if you have to fake it to make it. Maybe at the end of the video you should add a video of  reps of military presses and upright barbell rows. In most chearleading stunts its mostly vertical lifting. So this will showoff your strength.,Cheerleading,d1zeup9,3,t5_2r5ii
7552214,0,t1_d30mbp9,I guess it just depends on the school. I have a lot of friends that are in athletics in every division and concussions are a top priority at all of their schools,Cheerleading,d30nfto,1,t5_2r5ii
8723833,0,t1_d6w3qyv,Dude that sucks. I dont know about outside of Oregon but thats all they do here. I really hope I can have my team do something different but I dont think I have enough girls for it anyways.,Cheerleading,d6w4ci8,1,t5_2r5ii
8762860,0,t3_502y0n,Sounds like theyve completely made their minds up and nothing will change it given theyve already said they expect people to quit etc. Could you run it as a club sport and compete all star?,Cheerleading,d710ot6,4,t5_2r5ii
8895489,0,t1_d7h3arl,Well as far as screen time the cheerleading bit is only about  of the script. For this short cheerleading is really a vehicle for the protagonist to face conflict with the people around him. Its not necessarily a cheer film although I would love to do one in the future. Also Ill be shooting around MarchApril so I have a little time to meet with people in the cheerleading world. If I did a feature I would definitely research more extensively or choose a different vehicle. What you are talking about is definitely true though and I think filmmakers are slowly getting better at it  being true to the subject matter. We can see the attention to detail in shows like Mr. Robot where S. Esmail tries his hardest to represent the hacking world as it really is. His characters use lots of the same tools in the show as people do in reality. Theres almost nothing that shatters the illusion for me as an audience member faster than false depictions in subcultures that Im familiar with. I realize that I have to earn the audiences attention and I take that very seriously. Film demands so much more attention than most media so Ill try to buy that attention with a combination of authenticity and believable character interaction.,Cheerleading,d7h3zuh,2,t5_2r5ii
