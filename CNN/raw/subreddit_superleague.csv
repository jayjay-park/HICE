8635337,0,t3_4y2xzg,This debate is just bollocks. In the Premier League theres literally  teams a season that play a fuck load of redundant matches why should every game matter so much? Should round  matter as much as the grand final? I wish everyone would just fuck off. ,superleague,d6l0w3w,1,t5_2sjgl

Im not keen on the current format. Qualifying for the top  is supposedly a achievementIm guessing Wakefield would have got bigger crowds in the middle. ,superleague,d6lgscb,2,t5_2sjgl

9208617,0,t3_565eyx,He says super league teams shouldnt be losing to championship teams but still wants relegation and promotion.You cant have both....otherwise the bottom and tops will just keep changing at least with the super s the best will move up and it could involve more championship sides moving up.At the end of the day if a super league team cant beat  championship teams then they deserve to be kicked out.EDIT The only difference between the championship and SL seems to be endurance we saw last year the CS can give the SL teams a run for their money in the first half but collapse at late stages.,superleague,d8j9ee1,1,t5_2sjgl

9230983,0,t1_d8lwa2h,gt Clark is the best hooker in the leagueIndividual and club markers of success would say otherwise. Statswise Houghton and Clark are similar but opposite with Houghton doing more work in defence and assisting more tries whilst Clark does more work in attack. Roby has his feet in both camps statwise by not being as bad as either players weakness but also not excelling at either players strength however he makes half as many errors as either player does and misses less tackles which suits international Rugby better  you need to hold your nerve and cant afford to make errors in internationals.,superleague,d8m3f1u,3,t5_2sjgl
