This makes it impossible to acquire any soundfonts from there.,UndertaleMusic,d6qvwa7,1,t5_3f7ar

9404945,0,t1_d984vwz,Oh  but Frisk having a theme. To me that doesnt seem right. Frisk is a blank slate. I mean just look at that face. Look at it. Frisk is essentially Spock. They are simply a way for the player to enter the world of Undertale as many RPGs in the past have done. Their personality is defined by whatever the player puts onto them however the player chooses to play the game. So how could they have a theme that would truly represent who they are?,UndertaleMusic,d9855vp,1,t5_3f7ar

I only give the Discord more attention because its where most of the questions comments and songs are being posted now. I still have this here because people still post great content here and I dont want it to go to waste.,UndertaleMusic,ddsqtca,2,t5_3f7ar
