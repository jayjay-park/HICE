8324108,0,t1_d5hd5mt,It was great hearing your thoughts. It shows us your perspective and i appreciated that.But i was dissapointed it had no juicy details or news. Essentially it was everything we already knew told from dev perspective. Was really hoping for some beta info.,Seaofthieves,d5i2ha9,2,t5_38oz1

8369209,0,t1_d5nnwk2,Debatable... Joke on side but if you really want to grow a Youtube channel which in this case is informative. Do better research on the game and stay on the subject. Make it more appealing like add pictures videos relevant to the subject as well. I think you dont try hard enough if you want to increase those view numbers. ,Seaofthieves,d5np9ec,-1,t5_38oz1

9342446,0,t1_d8zvs2o,I think thats because it was in response to a beta statement.We know theres a friends and family internal alpha out and playing right now. But we havent officially heard if public players with NDA will have access to the alpha or if we must wait for beta.But thank you for this link good info!,Seaofthieves,d90808o,1,t5_38oz1
9737712,0,t3_5eibgl,Since it looks like its going to be an Xbox Play Anywhere title it is most likely going to exclusively be a Windows  release due to it being a UWP game.,Seaofthieves,daddw2u,2,t5_38oz1

10049398,0,t3_5jn77k,I wouldnt even bother with any information that isnt from the Devs. Theyve been pretty good about responding to redditors on this sub. I know they might not be able to reveal the actual release dateif they have one but Im sure there will be a verified announcement done by one of them. ,Seaofthieves,dbhgn9s,8,t5_38oz1
10274895,0,t1_dc8phus,They havent had a steady release schedule so demanding a steady release schedule is silly. You are annoyed they arent meeting an unreal expectation that you set. This is whiny. I would prefer for them to make content for us whenever they have spare time and focus more on the games content. They are literally in the early alpha phase of game making there is no need to be putting out content weekly or twice a week. The only thing we know is it is supposed to release this year so you need to calm down. I get you are excited but saying they are annoying their fan base is just plain wrong.EDIT If all you wanted to do was suggest they release more footage why title your post in a way that suggests hype is dying when it clearly isnt?,Seaofthieves,dc8pr0p,1,t5_38oz1

10374946,0,t1_dck1wuc,Im just disappointed. Ive been following this subreddit for at least a year now when it was just a few hundred people. I subscribed to their emails before they had insider.

10646177,0,t3_5sbqdo,Id like a completely textured and explorable ocean floor with underwater caves and air pockets to get fresh air from. It would be nice to retrieve gold from your sunken ship if you lost a battle and survived or died and came back to get it. Also flag customization with different locations you can place them on the bowsprit or off the back of the ship not just on one mast. ,Seaofthieves,dde2ky2,7,t5_38oz1

10841851,0,t1_ddwzsku,It will work correctly. Theres just a chance that the PCs version isnt great in terms of MK as the game is likely designed around an Xbox controller. Its possible the game will feel iffy on MK because of this.          However most cases of people opting for a controller on PC is when the game is a fast pase action game.

11081717,0,t1_deo17qm,Continuing on what Fugaciouslee said.  This is an extra session they arent getting rid of the weekend ones.  So what we all arent going to be able to make it?  I dont think its intended for everyone thats part of the point.  And anyways you dont see anyone from other time zones that this is inconvenient for complaining.  Always Americans the rest of the world isnt viewing us too great right now.  We should try to be a bit more optimistic and grateful.,Seaofthieves,deo3pie,5,t5_38oz1

11684652,0,t3_66lqpm,I loved Black Flag. How fun would it be if they renovated luxury cruise lines to be pirate ships where you could spend a week and a half sailing around the Caribbean on vacation hoisting colors heaving to and tying knots.
