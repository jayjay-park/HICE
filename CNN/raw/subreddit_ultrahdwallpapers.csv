8945706,0,t3_52s6zs,This is literally just upscaled to k. If you want it as a background you could do this by choosing stretched or whatever its called in the windows settings. Also it will probably look pixelated a bit because the source is obviously smaller than k. Also by k I assumed you meant x.
