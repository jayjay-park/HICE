The DragonBlooded like to forget that there are many ways of dealing with spirits that dont require the puissance of Exaltation. Salt thaumaturgy ghostleaf tea and minor artifacts such as the staff presented there are all fairly effective against the vast majority of ghosts but their real power comes mostly from knowledge and expertise in these matters. A monk would know about the existance of physical fetters for a ghost and threaten or bully it with that knowledge. If he has access to his essence pool he may try to banish the ghost using manipulationoccult. He may also try peaceful means of resolving the ghosts grievances and coercing it to pass peacefully into lethe. Gods are trickier to deal with but many terrestrial spirits are vulnerable when their domains are threatened or if the monk uses his influence to stifle prayers and offerings to the god.

7451547,0,t1_d2p4j6n,Well with the Decisive attack mechanics it takes on average a pool of  dice to kill a mortal character dead  health levels. Thats... honestly uncomfortably small I would expect nontrivial enemies to potentially be able to hit that within a round or two of combat starting if they roll a decent Join Battle.Five OxBodies adds assuming  Stam for a tanky character  health levels which pushes the average pool needed to kill you to a round  dice. Thats far less likely to happen.While were mathing stuff lets look at likely sizes of Withering attack pools to get a sense of how much Initiative can shift on a turn. The very best mortal could potentially pull out a pool of   Attribute   Ability   Weapon accuracy to hit which will give us an average success count of . Similarly lets give the opponent a maximized ParryDodge of  so theyre hitting with zero carryover. That puts us at a raw damage of  well continue to put our guys in the best gear we can so our final pool is  netting us   a  initiative swing per hit approximately doubles will poke it a bit higher.Next up we look at Join Battle rolls. Still working with the very best mortalkind has to offer we have a starting pool of  leaving us with on average  and probably closer to  hits. Lets roll with  since the maths easier. This places us at a starting Initiative of .So all together lets have our Badass Mortal roll into battle with  Initiative and the first thing he does is make a withering attack . Lets say its against a weaker opponent hes only a mortal and he manages to crash them gaining a further . Weve already hit  and to be frank these numbers of a little low since Im not really taking specialties stunts or doubles into account much. So Id expect it to be relatively easy to obtain an Initiative of  within a turn or two of combat starting. And indeed the Exalted Combat  writeup shows us that thats pretty much exactly what we see in some example combats. This means that decisive attacks which ignore soak remember of on average  damage are pretty standard fare.OxBody x gets us to the point where we can just barely survive two of these. Sure a Solars going to have a looooooot of other ways to not get killed but at the end of the day being able to take at least a single solid smack and not fall over is likely to be beneficial. Especially when you start fighting against anything more powerful than Mr. Badass Mortal.,exalted,d2p6zo4,2,t5_2sgtt

7554585,0,t3_4ipxz8,I highly favor the option of a favored ability being supernal. But I believe the storyteller should approve all instances of it and should think long and hard about it while also discussing with the player. Sometimes it just obviously makes sense and will produce a good character concept. Sometimes it produces very poor effects.You should consider how this impacts other players in your game as well. For instance Dawns are special because only they can have supernal combat abilities. I for one wouldnt let another nondawn take a supernal combat ability if we already had a dawn unless said dawn was not only okay with it but enthusiastic about it.,exalted,d30x522,1,t5_2sgtt

7616148,0,t1_d37sqaa,gt Rakan Thulio is no exception. He might want to break fate but he suffers from the same hubris aiming for the celestial bureaucracy and unwilling to admit that there is a greater concept of Fate guiding him than the one he opposes and that the freedom that he strives for is utterly unattainable.There was not in the context of Exalted any idea of an ineffable destiny that should or must occur until Glories of the Most High The Maidens of Destiny introduced Samsara.  The Loom of Fate enacting the Five Year Plan of squabbling all too human divinities was a rather direct subversion of that concept.And that concept of Fate is absolutely one that Rakan Thulio can smash to fucking splinters.  That concept of Fate is also the one that the Sidereals maintain defend and act as the agents of.Ergo while we can argue if that is real fate or not it is the topic at hand when discussing how Thulio helps define the Sidereals and how the Sidereals help define Thulio.,exalted,d37wzzq,0,t5_2sgtt
7616582,0,t1_d37xs7j,Hm.  Alright I think I see the disjoint.I was using evil as a short hand for either pain privation or the absence of pleasure as describing phenomena of the world and actions and beliefs which are antithetical to my own actions and beliefs as describing characters in the worldI believe and again correct me if I am wrong that you assumed I was using evil as in an active force opposing the good by its nature in a relatively manichean dichotomy.  Which is a fair reading!  Just not remotely what I was intending.That said the traditional conceptualization of Destiny in Exalted straddles the line between eastern and western mythologies.  Fate hews closer to that use of karma Destiny The Loom of Fate and the Maidens of Destiny are all much more drawn from the Norns  Fates of IndoEuropean mythology spinning the lives of men from the stuff of chaos weaving them into a grand pattern which cannot be defied and being cut by the shears of death.Exalted them promptly subverts that by A having Destiny be more of a guideline than a definite thing and B having Destiny be planned in committees taken straight out of the Celestial Bureaucracy of Journey to the West.  Destiny isnt special or ineffable its just a tool that another faction seeking to enrich or empower itself uses.  For the moment Im ignoring SamarsaIn that case I would contend that most readers of the books will be immediately very sympathetic to Rakan Thulio because hes right.  The Loom of Fate is a monsterous engine weaving cruel fates to the kind and kind fates to the cruel because Amoth CitySmasher called in a favor from Dovey The Peace Maker.  The Gods arent using Destiny to the benefit of man why should men defend this awful thing?  Let those with the power tear off their shackles!  If misfortune finds me let it be misfortune of an uncaring universe rather than to the enrichment of vain and petty spirits.Of course its the Loom of Fate.  Fate in Exalted e and e anyways is basically what you described as karma.  Its the laws of causality and the natural laws that govern the world.  Destiny is woven upon the Loom of Fate but the name implies that the Loom is governing and regulating those natural laws as well.The fanon that tends to get read is that destroying the Loom of Fate would sunder the natural laws of Creation and lead to the whole ediface of reality collapsing.If thats true then Rakan Thulio is a cackling madman who wants to destroy Creation over a spurned love.Rakan Thulio being basically unambigiously correct and Rakan Thulio being a worldending threat are both dull options IMO.  Thus the post was laying out manifestly poorly! why this is the case and exploring a potential alternative in which neither is true.,exalted,d37yrzg,3,t5_2sgtt
7651339,0,t1_d3bwoya,And I just disagree that Join battle is supposed to represent that kind of a thing.  Heres what the book says about Join Battle.gt It measures a characters responsiveness and readiness when violence breaks out and things turn uglyhow fast can she drop into the mindset of a fighter and how ready is she to take command of the pace of battle?Theres nothing there to suggest its at all about noticing when youre being attacked.  It just seems wrong to turn it into some kind of Spider Sense that lets you notice at the last second when youre about to get jumped.  It shouldnt be some kind of magical awareness that youre going to fight.  It should be a measure of your initial responsiveness once you are fighting.Edit  To be clear though I think your interpretation is what the book actually says about it.  The Join Battle section pretty clearly states that its rolled for all combatants as soon as combat starts and then the ambush section says you cant ambush people with higher initiative than you.

7865417,0,t3_4n1mvq,Heres what sold me on Exalted but it precludes that youre a tabletop player already.In DampD youre expected to start as a mewling whelp slapping your LARPquality foam sword over kobold eggs or some shit until you level up enough and roll good on the loot tables to finally have some real fucking fun. Exalted kicks in the door like Fuck all that noise and starts you off as a demigod possibly as inheritor to weapons on par with lets say Excalibur. None of this rolling around in gutters and piss trying to pick up tavern wenches with your wrinkly coin purse oh no. Youre a Chosen of the gods bitchif youre not forcing your way into the Gates of Heaven or kicking in the teeth at the maw of Hell at some point or something of equivalent epic scale then youre doing it wrong. Youre in the same class as Beowulf. You threw spitballs at Hector passed notes to Achilles crushed a little on Brunhilde. If Tolkienesque stuff is high fantasy then youd better sit back and fire up the Pink Floyd because DampD is the gateway drug to Exalteds hard shit.More seriously Exalted pulls from a combination of largely Greek and Norse mythology rather than Tolkienesque stuff. But it marries the imagery with stuff commonly found in s and s Japanese animation. The way someone described st edition to me was Imagine Ninja Scroll slept with Escaflowne and their love child had their biography written by Homer and sung by vikings.In DampD it was really hard to feel...well important. Yeah you could be a level  wizard and that means something to...someone Im sure but that assumes a status thats achievable with enough experience by anyone. Anyone can become a level  wizard with the right XP expenditure rightand some hamfisted storytelling about why Grimtog the Barbarian suddenly found himself at Hogwarts or whatever.Every entity in Exalted is unique tied to an Essence. Of the Solar Exalted for example there were only . Every one in existence is a reincarnation of one of the originals. Some shit happened and now that number is significantly lower. That means youre instantly in a separate class from everyone else. People cant aspire to become an Exalted...well they can but training and experience doesnt make someone Chosen the way it can make someone a level X class. A god has to turn their head and go Yall see this badass motherfucker? I like him. And even then. Even then once your character is Chosen there are things you cant change like your Caste. So of your already finite peers you further divide yourself so your character is truly unique not just because hes your character and a special snowflake but because its written into the rules of the universe. You dont need to be a halfdragon halfvampire halfsuccubus whos had all their powers stolen away to feel different from every other person in the game. Hell looking at the canon examples in the game its hard to be like anyone else without trying.The game itself has a wide variety of settings built in you can set your story in ThousandandOneNightsstyle Arabia fantasy Imperial China Tolkienesque Germania Gaimanesque wonderland theres even a steampunk sideworld trapped in its own universe if you want to go down that road and its a fun road. All of these settings are detailed enough that everyone can kind of agree on a big meta vision of them but left open enough for storytellers to insert their vision on them or build their own civilizations out in the open areas or break the setting over their knee if they want.Did I mention there are giant Escaflownestyle mechs? Because there are giant mechs if you want them in your story. And if you dont I mean thats cool too but theyre giant mechs.Theres a lot of room to ham it up in Exalted whether youre playing it seriously or not. The game has written in it the ability to veer into superpower soap opera and have the melodrama be entirely serious or to take all of that stuff and poke at it with good fun. But either way Ive always hated this idea that other RPGs DampD Dragonlance etc start in the tavern and shit just goes wrong and then youve gotta fix it. Something something oh heres a dragonnecromancergiant spider wooga wooga wooga! Then everyone rolls for loot and goes home for a pint.Exalted is a game where you really should be ripping stars from the sky fighting demons the size of skyscrapers yknow? The wailing and gnashing of teeth and all that. I just dont get that from other games even other White Wolf titles. The subtitle for Exalted has been for a while What legends will they tell of your deeds? In a good Exalted game you should be able to look back at the wake of destruction and realize that the world after your characters is irreversible. In most other games thats how the world looks at the games antagonists.Lets talk about the Bundle of Holding deal. Thats First Edition. They were using the D system from World of Darkness and a lot of problems came up in the combat. E tried refining these things but really only made it worse in many ways. I havent tried E personally but from what folks are saying it really takes the cake in the mechanics department evocations aside but were all hoping that gets addressed Soon.I will say though that E still has the best setting writing in it. They had allstar teams writing for Exalted especially in the setting chapters and the fiction sections. I could and did just sit for hours reading the books.EDIT You know after this and the Bundles of Holding post I really wish that the E fiction was preserved andor easily available somewhere. As I mentioned in the other post what piqued my interest in Exalted was opening up the DragonBlooded book in a Barnes amp Noble thinking it was some obscure World of Darkness expansion and reading the opening fiction blurb. The core books prechapter blurbs were all pretty stellar as well and all of them captured in their own ways the spirit and feel of the game as I ended up bringing them into my games cant speak for everyone here. I cannot in a single post articulate what really sets Exalted apart without going into examples from both and the fiction from the E books did that very very well. So I wish when people asked What makes Exalted the game great? I could point them to the fiction and just say Read this. If you like it well talk. If you dont no biggie.,exalted,d4058j9,15,t5_2sgtt

9385301,0,t3_5935cb,That is similar to a special tag that was linked to the Flametongue Repeater which was cut for space despite being the artifact for righteous devil. Medium Archery Artifact revolver with  shots usually wielded in pairs.   Box cartridges may be too advanced for Exalted plus you arent shooting actual bullets as you are forcefully ignite a spray of fire so separation is necessary.  I would probably let a revolving long arm Repeater with  shotsSorry for formatting phone,exalted,d95nibt,6,t5_2sgtt

9547299,0,t1_d9pgrls,wow Im bad at reading xDbackwateruncivilized area could mean Chanta. It is a rare occurrence of Lunar leading a mortal city along with a strange truce between the local Fair Folks and Spirits of the Forest. People from Chanta tend to have greenish hair due to generations of proximity to the Wyld and relationship with Fair Folks. If not Chanta which would be the most civilized uncivilized option you might simply wanna have been raised as a potential Lunar or Wyld barbarian who grew beyond his Lunar or Wyld expectation into a chosen of the Uncrd Sun. Surviving the harsh lifestyle of the Lunar or Wyld barbarian tribes is sure to make your character fit for the military life he sought after.,exalted,d9pwgwx,1,t5_2sgtt

9704167,0,t3_5e0kdt,Not a direct source and more a riff that is in sync with one one element of the setting of many exalted really is a throw everything in type of setting.  Ive always felt that Felix Gilmans Half Made World made for an excellent comparison to the border marchesmiddle marchesdeep wild.Good luck in trying to immerse yourself in the Exalted setting theres a lot there in the factual sense as well as the thematic.,exalted,da98w1v,1,t5_2sgtt

11433780,0,t3_62my8l,I should mention I am looking for collaborators! I need people to check for inconsistencies in the document such as the aforementioned nd Edition mechanics artists writers playtesters. Really if youre a fan of Exalted and you want to use whatever skills you have to get involved Id love the help! The original Nexus Project was created to bring fans together to create a collaborative narrative and I hope this document will do much the same. We dont have to wait for Onyx Path to have cohesive engaging content. We can do some of it for ourselves ,exalted,dfs0a0h,1,t5_2sgtt
