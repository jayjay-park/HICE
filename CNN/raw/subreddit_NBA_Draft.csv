Hezonja looks super athletic and toolsy with a nice shot but I have no idea if he can pass or defend on an NBA level. Oubre has great sizequickness but not great feel at all and is far from being ready. Dekker is pretty blah as a prospect and was basically carried by hot tournament shooting his only big  is size.

Llull is supposed to be one of the best players in Europe. He should translate well to the NBA but there is a question of his contract. The general idea is that he will command most if not all of the MLE.

I had him ranked as a midlate first last year which is a bench player and I have no reason to believe anythings changed about his game no rangeno rim protection to make him more valuable.  Okafor also has no rangeno rim protection.  If you pair those together youre just not going to win very much.  Any decent offense will just string together a bunch of PnRs and turn them in to easy layups over and over.On offense theyd be starting a backup of Clarkson and Kobe neither of whom can shoot from deep.  Have you ever heard of the clogged toilet offense?  This would be that times .  Especially since youre going to have Byron Scott insisting everybody takes midrange jumpers.

The player could theoretically refuse to sign the contract but that doesnt help them because they dont get paid without it and cant play with any other team. Drafted players have very little leverage and their contract structures are highly regulated so that kind of standoff almost never happens. First round contracts have two years guaranteed and the team can choose to keep them or not in years  and . Since rookie contracts are set at fairly low numbers depends on draft position   pick gets more  than the  etc any player thats any good will typically get their third and fourth year options picked up. Technically the drafting team could release the player at any time just like any player under contract allowing them to sign with whoever but thats generally not super useful.

11269357,0,t1_df9a3og,First people are overestimating Jacksons athleticism. Hes not nearly the athlete Wiggins is. Also the free throw shooting is a huge problem. People are also underestimating his off court problems. He followed a woman to her car than hit it and kicked it while also saying Im gonna beat your ass. He caused  in damage to her car. That kind of behavior isnt a one time thing.  ,NBA_Draft,df9d5ac,5,t5_2zstt
11290394,0,t3_614eer,Not sure how anyone can view Justin Jackson as a lottery prospect. I like that hes improved his jumper but he still looks like a streak shooter more than a pure one and still puts up some horrid misses. And outside of the shot he doesnt bring a whole lot else to the table offensively. He looks like he should be a transition threat and has decent feel in the half court but he doesnt strike me as a guy thats going to be efficient unless hes a high volumehigh pt shooter since hes not a guy thats going to draw fouls or do much inside the arc at the nba level.He doesnt project as more than average defensively either. He does compete and seems to have a pretty high IQ on that end but his below average strength and agility gives him very little defensive versatility.,NBA_Draft,dfbr05q,8,t5_2zstt
11345680,0,t1_dfhzx3a,Ok so you are saying he is fitting the bill of being a potentially defensive gamechanging athlete. Then I do agree with you.I thought you were insinuating that a  y.o. junior should be dominating at the level he is just to be a prospect.,NBA_Draft,dfi0gy5,2,t5_2zstt

11552788,0,t1_dg5fp9a,gt Do you have FGA and FG at the rim numbers in the half court for Wesley Iwundu and Sidiarius Thornwell broken down by percent assisted and unassistedWell theres an ingerant flaw here with the fact that since there can only be assisted and unassisted makes and misses are given no special notation as to whether they wouldve been assists had the shot gone in those numbers dont really exist. I mean some people say that they do and on Stats.NBA.Com they track them as potential assists and via touch time but they dont really exist with any reliability.I can give you the PPPs off play types that are usually assisted or unassisted though. Obviously PampR rolls and cuts are usually assisted while the other type of offense that generates looks at the rim arent.Wesley IwunduCuts  for  PampR Ballhandler  for  .Iso  for  Putbacks  for  .Postups  for  .Sidiarius ThornwellCuts  for   .PampR Ballhandler  for  .Putbacks  for  Postups  of  .PampR Rollman  for  .So yeah...

11555883,0,t1_dg5rbj5,Im glad to tell anyone I can. Ive got Fultz at number  just like almost everyone else Isaac  Ball  Jackson  Monk . I just think Isaacs college production was super ridiculous and underrated and that as a  at the next level he has almost no holes in his game. Hes got the best jumper of any of the elite forward prospects and hes far and away the best defender. I just think his combination of not having a fatal flaw but having tons of upside and the defensive production already there his advanced s at FSU were among the best in the nation puts him above the rest of that second tier for me. Balls rd because hes got questions about defense and finishing two things that worry me much more than Isaacs struggles creating his own shotcreating for others. The same goes for Josh Jacksons jumper  his FT is a massive red flag for me. I love Malik Monk but I dont know if he contributes a lot beyond scoring. And I have a whole host of issues with Jayson Tatum simply because he reminds me of the Rudy GayAndrew Wiggins archetype who is only concerned with scoring and doesnt make his team better. I dont mean to get all tinfoilhattish but Tatums th on my personal board.,NBA_Draft,dg5v34d,2,t5_2zstt

11560468,0,t1_dg6ciwn,Yeah Im not saying Isaac wont be extremely valuable if he reaches his potential. I just think the primary option guys are more valuable and more rare so Im willing to take a bet on a guy with that potential like Jackson even if his median outcome may be worse than Isaacs.And I get why your outlier guys are what they are. Im a little higher than some on Bridges and Im definitely way lower on Lauri than some but those are those are both guys Ive seen high and low so I wouldnt say my opinions are too uniquely outlier.,NBA_Draft,dg6dtdk,2,t5_2zstt
