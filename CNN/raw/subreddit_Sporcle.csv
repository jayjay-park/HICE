3751748,0,t3_33d0xs,Its interesting that the Silver Screen Superstar badge only takes  published Movie quizzes while Fun Supply takes  Just For Fun. If I had to speculate Id say this is because there are always two JFF quizzes published each day the word ladder and the missing word making it comparatively easier. Id expect the other categorypublish badges to use .,Sporcle,cqjxbvr,1,t5_2sf9q

5125873,0,t1_cv3k2hk,HOLY SHIT. I just realized a string of letters I wrote down during my second guess that I mistook for complete gibberish hours ago actually spells something. Except I cant quite figure out what to do with it. EDIT Yes I can. Had a slight brain fart so went in the wrong direction with it but Ive got it now.,Sporcle,cv3uyz0,2,t5_2sf9q

5278516,0,t3_3e35pz,I tried a lot harder to get all the badges when they were pretty much all getable. But now with all the publishrelated badges Ive pretty much given up. I mean getting games published is completely out of our hands and the odds unless youre a known Sporcler are like one in a million. So why bother? ,Sporcle,cvme3hy,1,t5_2sf9q

10570045,0,t3_5r3nl6,gt Also that year Sporcle released its long awaited subscription service Sporcle OrangeYes. People were just ecstatic when they could start anticipating an exclusionary section! And one they got to pay for! Oh happy day. Longawaited!Or...maybe... just more bullshit? Bullshit that has led now to a fullload Bullshit Crescendo!,Sporcle,dd67tmf,3,t5_2sf9q
