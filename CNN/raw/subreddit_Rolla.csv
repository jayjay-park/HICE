935915,0,t3_24tyyp,The  plan covers every single meal that TJ serves but that means youll be eating every single meal on campus to get the most out of it. If you like eating breakfast at the cafeteria go with the  or . Personally I cooked on the weekends and skipped breakfast so  was enough for me. The all points plan and the  blocks are actually the worst deal so skip that. Dont worry about the number of points unless you really like fancy coffee or the like. Look into minerbucks if you need extra points. They are cheaper than extra points from chartwells.,Rolla,chao322,2,t5_2rvtz

No one is going to stop riding bikes because some entitled assholes think they own the paths and no one is going to start riding bikes for the same reasons. Its immaturity at its finest. Get the fuck over it  people prefer different modes of transportation and you might have to stop being a dick and let them live their lives. Im sick of hearing douchebags get all up in arms about people on bikes like theyre better than them because they dont ride a bike. Jesus fucking Christ this is a campus of fucking adults and they all act like fucking st graders milling about on a fucking playground at recess whining about how their daddy is better because they bought them a fucking bike or didnt buy them a fucking bike.Assholes.,Rolla,ckxktxg,-13,t5_2rvtz

2534447,0,t3_2op4np,Im actually having a great day mixed with an okay one. Like I learned that I got an A on both a test that I was afraid I failed and on an essay I wrote in less than an hour that was half of the required length so thats awesome. But then Ive been having trouble with a huge comp sci assignment due on Wednesday and I realized that I had forgotten to do a looooong Russian translation over the weekend and its due tomorrow morning so you know not so awesome. But I cant really complain because one and a half of the two finals really just regular tests I actually have to take let me have a cheat sheet one of which I already made which I know from experience in the classes practically grantee me at least a high B.But then I got a migraine like twenty minutes ago and the happiness and productivity has been slowly draining away. ,Rolla,cmpe02q,2,t5_2rvtz

They called me just once to inform me the repair was finished. I dont trust mechanics that do repairs without authorization. I now take my car to a place in st.

6632489,0,t3_46i8zn,I spent  years in Rolla. I met lots of people from most of the frats.All of the frats will tell you that youre better for one reason or another. If you want to join a fraternity join one with people you get along with best. But you wont really be missing out on anything by joining a frat. At least you wont miss out on any more than you would if you DID join a frat. So what Im saying is dont rush because you think you need to join a fraternity Rush because you really want to join that specific fraternity. College is going to come and go no matter what so dont think youre missing out on anything by not rushing. Or by rushing for that matter.Edit I realize this doesnt really answer your question. But my point is that each frat considers themselves the best at everything but wherever you rush if you rush ultimately your experience will be what you make of it.,Rolla,d05cup2,4,t5_2rvtz

Because of the low numbers of interested students you have the opportunity to interact more with the faculty and staff. When I went the dean of the humanities school was a prolific author of history books and taught on the subjects he wrote about. Those were great classes. ,Rolla,d41111u,3,t5_2rvtz
