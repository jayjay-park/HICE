Not that the PCV is bad but this one eliminates the maps I just run a KampN filter on mine because my dealer told me that modifying the intake voids warranties. Go figure I can change the exhaust EFI no problem but cant touch my intake. That being said my dealer also told me to get the SampS ,VictoryMotorcycles,ch8dgfn,2,t5_2uoby
