3979860,0,t1_cr9kvvg,I completely agree with you and it makes me dislike Sitecore as a company.  It seems so shady to almost censor helpful content not that they actually do that it just seems so strange that even running a search on their own dev network often yields ZERO results and the only reason I can think of is for doing so is greed and the illusion of an exclusive product.I wouldnt use Sitecore if not for the fact that its been part of my company since before I came on board.Thank you for your response!  Hopefully this community picks up one of these days.  The CSS is pretty good at least!,sitecore,cr9xqsk,2,t5_2vkwx
