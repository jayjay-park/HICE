178248,0,t3_1w4qp2,Im getting it for the PC because I like having everything I own on one machine plus my PC is so great itd be a waste to get a multiplatform game on anything else.I also wanted to add that it is possible to use a controller for the PC. Its easy to buy a gamepad with a usb port from an electronics store or online shopping.,MightyNo9,ceyqjoc,6,t5_2yddn
1353825,0,t3_29i9se,Every time i look at this i am thinking to my self I am happy i didnt support this i dont want a new megaman i want a new game type of megaman.. he should use that dash to abuse the powers of things he fights like if he attacks a jumping enemies he get that power if he dashes at a fire one he get fire attacks for a short time or something.. its a neat way to show a combo system but still it nothing special its just another way to say hay let try this!?! reason why i want to be a game developer when you see old developers cant seem to use there teams correctly and just make the same game they made for years!  ,MightyNo9,cilzrhn,-1,t5_2yddn
1818773,0,t3_2fdg48,Scale and perspective are two issues hampering my positive spirits about Mighty No. .The larger and more intimate view of the concept art sold me right away. Compared to the concept however the beta is presented so that you are looking down into the game instead of at the game. Poor Beck is so small on screen that he isnt even the main focus of his debut. The visual scale of the beta is very close to Mega Man  and Mega Man X but very different from the concept art.Comcept can easily offer up a few view options to change up the play style but there is so much visual noise and effects going on during the .D gameplay that I fear viewing angle options might not do much for the presentation. The confident warm and inviting vibe I saw in the concept art seems to have evaporated a bit but I really want to play the game once it is finished before crying foul.,MightyNo9,ck8chtr,3,t5_2yddn

3116171,0,t3_2vrobe,Im a backer but I havent been paying much attention to this so Im not sure what to think. I dont like Dina for my own reasons. She wasnt voted in by the community she just kind of showed up. She introduced herself to everyone as if she was  and we were all  RaNdOm PENGUINS! kind of deal. Then we were promised that she was just a community manager and would have no effect on the game next thing I know shes talking about influencing the design of the game. The fact that shes not familiar with the Mega Man series made me a bit salty too.Being out of the loop for so long I dont know if anything has changed. All I care about now is getting my hands on this game because it looks fun. Dina is the last thing on my mind.,MightyNo9,cokzo82,8,t5_2yddn

6367461,0,t3_42rocp,Im a backer still excited for the game. Im gonna write some thoughts Ive had about the whole situation both about the people who were looking forward to the game and Comcept. Please hold your votes for after youve read the entire comment should you choose to.I knew there was a reason why they couldnt just tack on multiplayer later despite everyones wishes but I thought it was for cost and marketability. Always remember A business first priority is to make money. If Comcept put out a game fans didnt like but still somehow ended up profitable and they themselves liked then they will definitely do another. Several hundreds of people bitching about purity doesnt do anything to their margins if theyre able to get adequate shelf space as this allinone package game. Its all about sales.Releasing the game as SP only would restrict SEO dramatically. If you want an example search Shovel Knight a now coop capable game on Nintendos site and see what thats classified as. Now think of that couple or that pair of siblings that searches games based on if they have multiplayer capability thats a lost sale for YachtClubGames because they werent able to market effectively. But no one wanted multiplayer anyways is a response a lot of backers had and quite frankly its  just flat out wrong. The backers are the ones who unlocked the multiplayer stretch goal by donating so much. What is a company supposed to do when they make a campaign promise to deliver a function if they reach x amount of money? Turn around and say because of this vocal group of commentors we decided to use the money elsewhere? Isnt that some sort of fraud? Im not even sure if thats complies with Kickstarters TOS. And just to be clear I dont really care for MP either but I accept its part of the package. Anyways this is how I rationalized it for a while. Now with Nicks indepth update it makes a ton more sense and is at least a much less cynical perspective. They should have released this information sooner but honestly I doubt it would have calmed the backlash angry people tend to stay angry. For me where Comcept fails the hardest is not the underestimating the release date or adding in unnecessary features its the miscommunication. It has been so absolutely atrocious. The fact that they screen questions about support pisses me off its not right and its a terrible business practice. I can see why people feel burned. It is something that needs major overhaul.Im not hyped for the game anymore and Im glad. As Ive gotten older Ive noticed a trend with how disappointing a game is to me if Im hyped for it. I choose to see this as a blessing in a disguise. The game will eventually come out. And when it does I will play it and enjoy it at my leisure. No need for hype or overzealous excitement. Ill just continue to wait. Less expected disappointment this way....But those missing surveys though. .. Cmon man.,MightyNo9,czdesaz,2,t5_2yddn
6386325,0,t1_czfifnq,Agree to disagree on your second point. I personally feel you can achieve enthusiasm in different ways. But its just my opinion.Anyways Im glad that you see where I come from. I personally dislike Comcept over many things but I try to be as fair and neutral as possible. Nothing will ever excuse the mistakes they make I just hope they dont do it again in the future. I wont lie I still have hopes for the company to do well as for now I h ink its just a reality check for Inafune. He might lose alot of people now but if he learned and sticks with development he might come back. I dunno trying to be positive about it.,MightyNo9,czfk3x7,1,t5_2yddn

7778747,0,t1_d3qbdok,Im not sure Id agree that ARES is on the same level as MN.  MN has received a lot of bad press but I imagine if it were not for that you would rate it quite a bit higher than ARES.As for your first point Comcept is not an indie studio.  Im sure some things were outsourced but the idea that everything can be outsourced for super cheap is a bit silly.  Also things add up quite quickly.  Games that are made on an extremely small budget tend to be labors of love where the ones making it frequently are paid nothing or very little at the start and reap the benefits afterits release rather than actually properly funded games,MightyNo9,d3qdo03,1,t5_2yddn

8382934,0,t1_d5p8476,Yeah Action shift is a waste of buttons. I think you get invincibility frames for doing those but its an awkward move to perform and theres never a use for it Im going to kill that enemy with one reversedash bullet thatll teach it!.Crouchdash is awesome to slide under enemy bullets even though its likely to backfire if you dont time it right. That I disagree with is how its used in Dynatrons stage where you need to slide below an instantdeath turbine which in order to slide below you need to know about the crouchdash position yourself in a pixelperfect manner even though its unclear how close you can be without dying and because youre taught to never even get close to purple stuff because IT KILLS YOU and then your crouchdash is just barely long enough for you to make it past THE FIRST WHEEL. The obvious solution to that one would have been to put some sort of guard rail next to the turbine so the player simply bumps into it when they get close enough and if they really wanted to introduce the crouchdash there maybe put it just high enough that it wont automatically trigger the crouch dash.,MightyNo9,d5pey8m,2,t5_2yddn

8686994,0,t1_d6r62wi,Sticker Star wasnt even a game. Outside of the mandatory fights you literally never have to battle a single enemy to succeed. All enemies give you is coins coins for stickers all of the necessary ones of which you find lying around on the goddamned ground. There is never any incentive to do anything beyond the barest of minimums because the only compensation you will ever get for going out of your way is coins or stickers.TLDR An RPG where all you have any reason to do is run to the goal at the end of the area without interacting with anything else.Dont kid yourself man.Edit To anybody passing by Sticker Stars one redeeming factor that you dont need the actual game for The visual flair is nice but you need the actual game for that is the soundtrack.

9497118,0,t3_55sluo,The thing with the physical copies and kickstarter is this In  of the cases the guys making the game do not publish it. At least not the physical version. So they have to get a contract with someone to produce these. This guys pay to the game devs for doing so AND life of the margin left of sales  production cost  fees. If a kickstarter offers you to upgrade to the physical game it usually means they are actually buying copies with that extra money and giving it to you. Which is usually the worse deal than you getting the retail version yourself so they dont bother. v  What I am trying to say is this is not something you should expect regardless of any experiences with other kickstarters.,MightyNo9,d9jq01x,2,t5_2yddn
