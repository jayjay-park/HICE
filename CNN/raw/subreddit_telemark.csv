3531689,0,t3_306u2m,I have both axls and Bombers. Love them both.  I prefer my Bombers for my inbounds and for working on my skis making snow. They handle park great as well and are in general tough as nails. The toe bail really helps if your boots wiggle in your toe box due to worn duckbill or sole. Axls are next up for lateral support their toe box extends far down the side of your boot sole. Axl is easier to switch to free pivot bombers take an allen key to remove springs a potentially shitty time if you lose the cap in the snow on top of a mountain.,telemark,cpuu4sj,1,t5_2sds7

10728774,0,t3_5tg7fu,I just went and tried a few combinations on a Scarpa TX pro bootPetzl Vasak was a very good fit Petzl Sharken also worked wellBD Sabre tooth fit with a slight mod to the toe bailGrivel Cramp O Matic was a good fitSome of the other semi auto crampons would function for glacier travel and limited steep snowice work but didnt fit as tightly as I would want.All of the good fit crampons above have heavier front points for more aggressive climbing. I have not done any steep ice with my set up just snow couliors and steeper glacier travelNone of the strap type crampons fit well enough to do any technical work. Id be wary of even glacier travel with any of these units.I hope that helps!,telemark,ddmlcsy,1,t5_2sds7
