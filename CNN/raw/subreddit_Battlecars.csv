1557618,0,t3_2c2fx5,My friend hashad some POS lexus Toyota that was in a frontside collision.  We got it back together to where it would drive but he wanted to use it out in the desert to beat on.  The  major problem I saw with that car was the oil pan hangs out the very front and center of the motor.  Theres no way in hell he would make it a mile off road without tearing a hole in it without a skid plate.  Take a picture of the bottom of the engine and see where the oil pan hangs out at and post it here.,Battlecars,cjbirew,3,t5_30yds

4939031,0,t3_3ijziz,Its a  nova I bought almost  years ago. The years had been spent in a friends garage so working on it was hard and not efficient. Cleaned it up stripped it down tossed the junk most of it and fixed what I could  pretty much none of it. Replaced the floorpans trunk pan tire down and rebuilt the frame.Has a  goodwrench block got it off a guy for  bucks.  speed stick from an  camaro  bucks.  The car only came with its body and rear end a . geared ford . inch PO installed a decently strong unit its a cruiser anyways but in the future I want a . or . for some more pickup but it goes pretty well without it. Cant think of much else right now. I plan to turn it into a resto but right now it serves well as a rat rod because body work is time consuming and costly as hellEdit also the PO had cut the hole in the hood for his air cleaner he had a  in it and was too tall for the hood. I plan on filling that space with a double barrel intake a bit much for non charged intake but long term I would like to build the motor up for a supercharger.,Battlecars,cuh3rxj,11,t5_30yds
