3448821,0,t1_cpkljbf,Ive been in the tunnels at all hours and they are not that bad. If I remember correctly the guy on the motor cycle was during the summer which has almost no one on campus. He was more of a danger to himself than to anyone else.If you could help me understand how controversial issues are being discouraged as almost every week there is a new poster up in the dorms about some sort of social justice. For example today I saw a poster put up saying that bill C is now making Canada a police state and they had a speaker who was endorsed by the Communist Party of Canada which is pletny controversial as the bill is trying to reduce the risk of the shootings that happened in Ottawa a few months ago. Callling Canada a police state is like calling North Korea a free democracy.As for financial aid I can not speak much on as I come from an average family however that does not mean that I am not going to be working  jobs over the summer in order to pay for housing and school. If you are looking for aid there are thousands of grants and bursaries online to apply to. In my high school the interantional students were much more rich than the kids at my school as they were driving in top end Lexus and BMWs with the sports package addons.  Yes I think that students should recieve aid but at somepoint you have to stop expecting things to be given to you and find a way that you can help your self. ,CarletonU,cple4c2,0,t5_2s47v

Technically they are not allowed but most profs bend that rule to give you more time to do the assignment lab report.  I have to ask is it ?So in term you go up high to the dean and get this fixed its pretty much saying fuck you to the prof. There are still a final exam the prof can screw with you.
