6008718,0,t1_cy76d7o,Once you set up everything becomes just like you said. If you have some issues you can ask on the forum and people will jump in. Also ther are already various tutorials.After creating a user and buying a plan download the client from their page and insert your username and password. This is what i looks like image of the clientThere are two buttons.  you click on Activate Network Lock and . Connect to a recommended server or you can click on servers and pick the one you prefer.Now you are ready to browse more anonymously.As for torrenting you have to forward a port first. Basically once registered there is a client area where you can add a port which  you can chose or it is done automatically. So once you have a port just insert it in you torrent client and thats it.Here it is explained even better The beauty is that you can also choose a protocol which i suggest to try in case there are issues by default it is set to automatic,VPNTorrents,cy79vp9,1,t5_35vrl
6078348,0,t1_cyg9yo4,Yeah I was just talking with PIA and they were telling me they didnt have dns which I kinda want so I can just go through my tv for netflix and have my router setup using the vpn for my torrents and then be able to just swap over to my regular router for when I want to full speed  be in my own country.

7308053,0,t3_4fhltq,I think its very dependent on your location.  IMO you want a close server which is most important amp a VPN that allows port forwarding.  Though maybe some people might say port forwarding isnt necessarily important it is frequently listed as an issue that can affect performance.I would test out AirVPN Torguard or Ghost Path and go with what gives you best performance.  Thats the only ones I know that have lots of server locations and also allow port forwarding.    ,VPNTorrents,d28vjgw,1,t5_35vrl
7567653,0,t1_d32ef6d,Well forget the ISP then how do I keep these rd party companies from knowing what I torrent?Ive been looking at the comparison chart and Both Nord and Private Internet Access look like decent VPNs but Im still not sure if they would be the best.As I stated I dont care about security I can take care of virusransom ware and all of that myself I dont care about speed to much I only care about hiding myself from the ISP or rd party copywrite companies.,VPNTorrents,d32elu1,1,t5_35vrl
7623438,0,t3_4jqrox,gt Is there a way to automatically STOP downloading torrents when the VPN drops as an alternative to the kill switch?Two ideas. Configure your OS firewall to only allow your torrent client to communicate through the VPN network adapter. e.g. in Windows Firewall if your regular LAN is private amp your VPN is public then you could create a firewall rule to allow qBittorrent etc. to communicate only on the public network.. Use a torrent client that can bind itself to a particular NIC Network Interface the idea being that the torrent client binds to the VPN NIC amp if the VPN goes down then the torrent client simply thinks the internet went down amp everything pauses. qBittorrent can do this not sure on other clients.Caveat Ive only done light testing with both of the above ideas probably cant give you much insight on how well it would work long term. But theyre definitely worth trying if you want to use something aside from the VPN clients own kill switch.,VPNTorrents,d38qt2w,3,t5_35vrl
