10873335,0,t3_5vclqv,I almost always go RoA into Sorc Shoes. After that it depends on the team but for the most part its Void Staff into Zhonyas or Death Cap into whichever I didnt build. If Im against Zed Ill get Seekers into RoA into Sorc into Zhonyas. My last item is almost always Liandrys. ,karthusmains,de1i9nd,2,t5_38tcw

No because chances are that they arent doing their best to dodge your Q especially under tower or as other people call it boosted.,karthusmains,dg70b4z,5,t5_38tcw
