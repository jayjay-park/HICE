1794783,0,t1_ck5co5n,Yep in a nutshell thats the direction of travel Id like to see. I cant think of a successful privatisation at least not in my lifetime so thats why Im wary of it. I accept that putting things out to competition can be a good thing but not if service provision suffers or costs increase due to required profit margins. I generally object to taxpayers funding private business profits through government spending although it cant always be avoided.  I wonder if theres a country that has got a good model for privatisation. Thats a research topic for another day. I do wonder about how to limit ministerial corruption. I have some ideas for improvements Id like to see a model where sitting ministers have increased salaries say K but are not allowed expenses on anything but accommodation no subsistence no minibar while on parliamentary business.  No second jobs no sitting on boards no pay for after dinner speaking. The state pays for any secondary accommodation and its returned to the state after the minister is no longer an MPMSP.  as an aside we could also tie parliamentary pay to the average wageIf you follow that general principle the single biggest issue is stopping lobbying on the promise of a board position after the minister is no longer an MP.  Ive no idea how you can work around that.,scottishpolitics,ck5dr06,1,t5_2u66o
1845044,0,t3_2fo3r9,Well more powers is more powers either way Scotlands going to get it pretty good. Im hoping that this will lead to a much more federal U.K especially if Scotland stays it can be seen as a beacon to look at for what all Nations in the U.K should become. ,scottishpolitics,ckbiuzw,2,t5_2u66o
1856348,0,t3_2fumsz,Its a fascinating poll.  Still a very high number of DKs and the swing appears to have come fully from the No vote. Also the demographics make for interesting reading.  are the only demographic where the No campaign are winning.,scottishpolitics,ckcvvct,4,t5_2u66o
1896030,0,t3_2gc8ko,This could explain the incredibly high voter registration rates.If the vote is very close then things like this could have swung it.Edit  Someone said . in another thread. I think thats way too high and worryingly so. Itd be really great if there was that level of engagement but its not credible.If its  legitimately and the vote is split  then that . will mean that the final result changes from  Yes  No to  Yes  No.A disaster would be if after the vote which goes Yes we find out it really should have been No.... what do we do then? If we find out in January  do we pull the plug?,scottishpolitics,ckhnudk,0,t5_2u66o

6772496,0,t3_48ioqz,While Ive always been on the No side I do find the proposition of a Yes vote a bit stranger now at the referendum we had a fairly positive economic forecast given in Scotlands Future.Given what we know about the state of oil revenues right now and whats likely to happen with onshore revenues in future just look at the way the Scottish Government fought tooth and claw over the no detriment clause  they know the forecasts not rosy independence at this point in time would offer a quick choice between taxes soaring or spending cuts which make Osborne seem like the very model of generosity.,scottishpolitics,d0jy0d2,2,t5_2u66o
