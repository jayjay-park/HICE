This seems to be the case in RWS classes where numbers are set and they dont really allow professors to expand class sizes.Unless youre spot  maybe  or higher waiting on a sub  occupancy class Id recommend that you not be optimistic.,SDSU,dc28w4p,2,t5_2rxuk

10311018,0,t3_5nk1e3,Posted here before but lots of personal details this time so a throwaway. I hope to walk this spring  after  years if everything goes well this semester so wish me luck. Like the name says I came in as a nonscholarship athlete and played all  years. I am a Business major and I pretty much stayed on track. My sport has been a friggen TON of work   hours per day practices travel time weights physical therapy for  injuries and quite a bit of volunteer time both sport related think incoming athletes and support for other teams as well as outside charitable organizations. But what an athlete gets in return is pretty damn conducive to the educational experience.  Due to priority registration I have NEVER not gotten my desired schedule. Not once was a class full not once did I have to crash or waitlist.  Coaches trainers and a dedicated counselor all work to keep you on track.They will basically baby sit you re grades  as an underclassman but will continue to review grades all  years. Substance testing as well as school and NCAA standards means that any temptation to stray outside the lines is just a real bad idea. You dont even want to post a pic of you with a red cup or a shotglass on Insta and if you get written for partying the coach is notified.  If you need help the coaches will find you a tutor. Never needed it but I was asked to tutor several athletes outside my sport.  The program pushes you to finish in  years  along with GPA its one of the main metrics that the athletic department uses to measure their success at the educational component of the sports teams. So I am getting out in  years. The tradein is that you wind up taking a lot of night classes pull a bunch of allnighters to get your shit done have a really abbreviated social life and limp around with coldpacks taped to joints.   The upside is that I get my degree and get on with my life  and I get to start earning so I can start paying on my loans. WooHoo...,SDSU,dcct63d,3,t5_2rxuk
