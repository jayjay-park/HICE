1628041,0,t3_2cyjly,It has been postulated that depending on the EMR job requirement  it can be far more economical to launch a huge instance at significant cost for a short period of time versus launching a small instance at a much lower cost for a lot longer.Quantification of this breakeven point is not straight forward as it depends on the job and a per requirement basisFrom experience one of our EMR tasks was a lot cheaper to run on a few large nodes when compared to a bigger number of smaller instances.I cannot say whether this was down to the ability for larger instances to grab bigger chunks of the job because of the larger disk size or the CPU power being able to crunch the data faster the actual job and the job process is not visible to me.I am not sure that it is possible to add disk to an EMR node.Evaluate...If this is a regular requirement  run it on a small instance cluster then run it on a bigger one and then a bigger one still  and map the results. You should be able to work out the sweetspot where the cost is minimised on a certain number of certain sized instances.I believe that should be looking at the hourly billing units... unless speed is a requirement a job that runs for  minutes can often be more preferable to one that runs on a largerbigger EMR cluster in  minutes. You will AFAIK be paying for a full hour on both instance sizes ... and smaller are cheaperThere are others who know far more about it than I do,aws,cjkdo59,2,t5_2qh84

4846103,0,t1_cu576qb,This might sound a little out of left field but I can say I made the most progress given one of two circumstances.  First the best thing I ever found was having a good mentor.  I distinguish this from having a good teacher because for me a  on  approach is much more helpful.  When pair programming was popular this was a big boon  you can still find places that do pair programming but if not you can generally at least get code review.  If someone gives a lot of helpful comments on your code reviews its probably reasonable to ask them followup or come to them first.The second area that really helped me was when I first started realizing that there are areas that other developers would define as off limits to themselves.  Some devs wouldnt dig into framework code to figure out what exactly was going on  regardless of whether this framework was custom inhouse or open source.  Some devs wouldnt dig into the database to look at queries to see how they performed.  Some devs wouldnt touch front end code or back end code.  I still shy away from HTMLCSS some but I have IE scars heh.  Other areas to think about are how deployments work or what happens to your code after you check it in to get it into production.  Any time I noticed someone hand off something to someone else that was the big red flag to dig in and figure out how that works.More generally learning to frame the question in a way that makes it easy for other people to answer or provide help often puts you in a position to solve it for yourself.  This is sometimes called rubber duck debugging  the act of trying to organize your thoughts and the problem in a way that you can explain it to someone can be the missing piece to get a solution.  Google and Stack Overflow have been my biggest standard resources but I read a lot of code on Github and hang out in a lot of channels on IRC on Freenode.The toughest thing has been finding that line between projecting confidence about completing a task you arent certain about and overcommitting yourself when you dont know how to do something.The other thing that came in between is that  years...  The most important thing regarding time is to never let yourself fall into a rut.  Many people with more than a couple years of experience let themselves repeat a previous year.

Been using it long enough and quite extensively to certainly get most of the fairly easily...now to chat with the boss man!re SAMLOkta so you are right in that there are multiple methods to integrate AWS with Okta. We actually using the SAML method with AD integrated into Okta. The interesting side effect of this is that we assign users to a security group in AD who then automatically pick up whichever AWS creds they need and the subsequent apps through Okta. It does use the full SAML integration through IAM and in fact you can pick up the amazon.com url and trigger it directly.I can also theoretically use ADFS to query against it and should be able to pick up the same creds. Anyway I understand the limitations of how this is working at present and part of those being Oktas issues so no worries at all. Also I just appreciate it existing at all! So many people have done work around this but then completely fail to share with the world.The section about the doc was to indicate that you can make the post against the AWS endpoint SAML assertion to select how long you want to keep those tokens. Now Im not positive it is usable in the Okta context but I do know it can be set at least through the Okta side.Btw this talk from reInvent the lady from autotrader specifically has some good info about how shethey built out a system and a utility to generate creds. They have a little web ui that allows you to enter how long you want them to last. Again thanks for all of this!

9203747,0,t3_56dex1,Were doing something similar at work except for network traffic instead of CPU utilization. Its probably similar to your use case though we calculate average traffic rates etc..So the way its currently designed All clients post traffic data to the same Kinesis stream in  second intervals representing the traffic sentreceived over the previous  seconds. A Lambda function pulls from the stream continuously has the Kinesis stream as an event source and simply writes the data to a new object in S. The S bucket is configured with notifications set up so that each new object posted to that S bucket invokes a Lambda function to process it. The Lambda function processing the data aggregates it to DynamoDB based on the configuration we have then deletes the object from S that triggered it.I havent got too deep into Cassandra yet but my understanding is its similar to DynamoDB so this may still help you.Lets say your machines are reporting in a  second interval. You could have a DynamoDB table with the following schemaColumn | Type | Detail||Machine Group ID | String | Partition KeyUnix timestamp rounded down to the nearest  seconds | Number | Range KeyWith a unique identifier for each machine you could use a column for each one and just update that column. So for every  seconds youd have after the two records get processed            Machine Group ID System X        Timestamp         Machine A ID .        Machine B ID .    So to get your average load over time you can issue a query based on the partition key Machine Group ID and the range key Timestamp and then average the two values together. For this case youd have a load of ..Of course there are many other ways of doing this although Id be happy to pitch you something different if this doesnt fit your use case. Ultimately you probably want to avoid going out of your way to get machines on the same shard since youre inherently introducing scaling issues that way.EDIT And Id be remiss if I didnt mention CloudWatch might be a better fit for this depending on your use case.,aws,d8in612,3,t5_2qh84

Then the plugin will zip your source code and place it in Amazon S for CodeBuild to use as its source. There is more information for setup in the readme of the plugin.First class VPC support is on our road map but I cant promise any dates  Currently the we support private docker repositories hosted in ECR.

Even if you have little to no backend experience with Amazon GameLift you can run sessionbased multiplayer games in the cloud.I dont have experience using it myself but it sounds potentially relevant.Its hard to give more concrete advice because your question is somewhat highlevel. There are many possible ways to implement what youve described. To get more specific advice it would help to break down the highlevel usecases you mentioned above into more details and then think about each step and how youd like to implement it. For example how does the application send an invitation to another player how does the person being invited receive the invitation e.g. push notifications?. Consider these sorts of details.Once players are connected and competing against each other then a clientserver interaction can handle the communication between each player application and a central server. However you might need to arrange for both clients to connect to the same server so that the server can pass data directly from one to the other. To keep things simple perhaps you might start with just one server so its not a concern. If there are multiple servers then each player might connect to a different one so it will be more complicated.,aws,ddcgs42,1,t5_2qh84

11172020,0,t1_deyc0mb,Ooh good idea. I was wondering the same thing and this might work for my needs,aws,deyc48j,2,t5_2qh84
11180786,0,t3_5bwg9d, IMHO both.  Have one common template with global resources in a common repo in a common location. This one we run only manually. Should include common items like your private vpc subnets ALB for each app default listener rules etc. Have another app specific template kept in the apps repository with things like app specific alb listener rules ecs service task definition ecs task role auto scaling group cloudwatch alarms etc. During our build process when an image is built successfully we tag it with either the git commit or git tag we use travis. This makes linking images to code extremely easy. Assuming you use a common naming pattern its easy to derive the ECR url and tag from information in the commit. This takes planning! Git repo awesomebackendservice Git tag v.. ECR .aws.comecrawesomebackendservicev.. By separating the templates into a common template which shouldnt really ever be getting updated unless you change your networking and an application template which could change often and only affects your app youll be in a much easier place.  As part of the build process for dev amp staging only your build provider travis jenkins etc can push the new ECR image and then in the afterbuild lifecycle hook you can do something along the lines of just issuing an aws ecs updatestack command. If you have a parameter which is the docker image then you can issue the updatestack command with useprevioustemplate assuming no template changes or you can provide the template to the command and specify just the docker image parameter with your very easily derived ECR url .  Using this pattern makes it trivial to deploy a new version and you dont need to create a new task definition. Something worth noting is that you can can set a family property on the task definition during creation. This allows you to track the number of revisions in the console. It will say something to the effect of awesomebackendservice if you are on your th revision.  Think about separation of concerns. Anything common or global to all apps should live in a common template. Anything app specific should live in its own template. Auto scaling groups app specific alb listener rules ecs service and task roles etc. These things should all belong to the app specific template. This allows you to make changes on the fly to one app at a time. Additional thoughts  scaling works pretty well but task placement is a problem for us and often prevents us from scaling our instances down completely. There is a new feature called task placement strategy which looks promising but it isnt available via CFN yet. When it is if you use binpack it will fill up the resources on an ECS instance as full as possible before scaling out. IMHO this is a drawback but i can tell you that it is at least on the roadmap for CFN.Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions. Id be happy to help.,aws,dezbvgu,1,t5_2qh84
11202234,0,t3_5zx44r,You sure can  There are lots of labs that are hosted at QuickLabs. Some of them free and most cost around  worth of credits. This should definitely meet your criteria of not costing an arm and a leg.,aws,df1rbvi,4,t5_2qh84
11214612,0,t3_600u5i,I do not have much experience with Organizations yet. But as that would match the current maximum for IAM managed policies it would not be surprising.Open a support ticket as feature request and lets hope AWS will remove that limit on SCPs I get why theyd want to limit it somehow due to parsing time etc. though.,aws,df35vi0,3,t5_2qh84

11327182,0,t3_61myle,Found the solution! Apparently in its current form the Cognito APIs do not load any user when one types    userPool?.getUsermadMeowerInstead one must do something like this    var u  userPool?.getUserbangerzgg.edu            u?.getSessionbangerzgg.edu password deadbeef validationData nil.continueWithexecutor AWSExecutor.mainThread block  awsTask in            if let error  awsTask.error as? NSError                  Error implies login failed. Check reason for failure                let exceptionString  error.userInfotype as! String                printexceptionString             else                                     return nil                    exceptionString will be a string that says UserNotConfirmedException if they are not confirmed or UserNotFoundException if no user is found with that username. ,aws,dffx140,1,t5_2qh84

11397989,0,t1_dfnuzu9,Might be worth to note that theres also a limit on IOPS and throughput per instance family and size. You may well run up against this limit before you hit the EBS volume imposed limit e.g. to get k IOPS youd need a  or xlarge instance. See the table on  for the limits. If you need really great disk performance and throughput theres the new i instances with localephemeral NVMe SSD disks. Theyre usually cheaper per GB compared to EBS and magnitudes more performant. Though with ephemeral disks you loose the data if the instance terminates and cant do EBS snapshots or such. For distributed databases like Elasticsearch or Cassandra that doesnt matter much since they do their own redundancy but for regular databases it might be less desirable.,aws,dfny45w,5,t5_2qh84

11707284,0,t3_66xf4s,I have a similar setup.  I have found cloudfront cache invalidations and modifying the cloudfront settings take quite a bit of time.  I have found it better to just set a TTL of about  seconds on each html file.  Static assets like js and css have similar settings.  Only files which rarely get changed like robots.txt and favicons have higher TTLs.  This system works really well for me. ,aws,dgn1u07,1,t5_2qh84
