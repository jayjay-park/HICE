3584812,0,t3_31d3lu, Episode  | Episode  | Episode   Introducing Hiroshi. Hes very mediocre and his parents wont let him live it down. Wait thats the village chiefs son no? This mom is insane. Someone told me this show should be called Barakamom because of her now I guess Ill get to find out just why. PHanda cant find the inspiration he found on day . Naru to the rescue! Miwa and Tama have arrived! Its glasses girl!! lt Yay. Lets see if shes a good character too. P I know I would be happy to tangle with those young girls. gtgt Tama is kind of rude. I like her. xD Damn he was way too happy to be praised. Looks like he found his motivation. And Hiroshis mom keeps going...HINA!!! Shes gonna be my favorite I already know. I wonder when Handa is going to realize he will never be able to focus while on this island. Holy crap Naru is too cute. EVERYONE! GIVE ME YOUR POWER! Handas calligraphy room almost feels like an insane persons torture room. Hiroshi is starting to learn that Handa is a hard worker. Reevaluate your liiife! Looks like Hiroshi has a crush on Senseiiii The nurse got mad that Handa wouldnt lay a finger on her? Hahaha. Aww Naru is hanging around to make sure hes okay. Miwa and Tama arrive! The drip is almost empty! Sensei is going to die!!! Jesus it isnt that big of a deal. xDMasochistic pleasures. Thats an interesting way to refer to a suppository. Naru being adorable under the bed with the nurse call button. Also ghosts? Bahaha. Handa covering his ears because hes a coward thats kind of cute. Hiroshi appears! I like that hes actually looking out for Handa.Old guy at the hospital here to give him a little bit of wisdom. Looks like each episode is going to end with him having a huge surge of inspiration. And the episode ends with the nurse wanting to do anal with Sensei. Even though she has a husband! I know thats not what it said. xDDont test my love of my husband! Shes so adorable. Turns out the old man was a ghoooost! Spooky scary! Handa cut all his fingers while trying to chop onions thats kind of creepy kind of disturbing kind of hilarious.,watchinganime,cq0waov,1,t5_33old

Aside from that maybe not my favourite arc I felt like it had a lot of fluff and I would maybe have liked less Tea Club  drunken sensei and more cutesy stuff but it was okay. Plus Im definitely keeping this aside for a reaction face when I need it.Pumped for the next arc I can already tell that Rihoko is best girl.Also lastly Ive finally caught up to these threads even though someone guess who recommended it to me just as it was starting as my important exams are done and dusted. ,watchinganime,crdj2af,6,t5_33old

Even their friends think they should go out. They even order the same thing! Hahaha. Ive never seen two anime characters so compatible. They always try to make the characters different enough. The opposites attract sort of thing. This animes like fuck that these two are going to be IDENTICAL.Theyre perfectly set up now. Just those two going to a concert on Christmas together. P Its almost as if their friends did this on purpose! Nobus reaction pretty much convinces me of this lol.Well go to the concert and then straight home before any romantic feelings develop. Its almost as if he sees it coming.A rival appears! And she looks just like Chiharu! That explains why Otani was going after Chiharu. Maybe not a rival but an ex. Two years huh? Thats a fairly long time. Thats as long as my longest relationship haha. Risas not very... Whats the word. Considerate? Just asking a guy why they broke up... Hes shouldering his own pain. And Risas a bit more considerate now that she knows.Mayu waiting by the school entrance to see Otani. To invite him to a party for people from the basketball team. Theres something I want to say to you. Maybe a rival after all?! gasp. Way to go Risa. Going right up and saying you should go. Though I think its still inconsiderate to think that Mayu and him will get back together? What if what she has to say is that shes engaged?! Or something equally hurtful for him.Poor Risas all alone c But its still awfully presumptuous of her to assume theyre happily together again. Calling it now hes gonna show up and spend Christmas with her! BOOM THERE IT IS. I made plans with you first. She can wait until next time. Thats awfully kind of him. Omg and he genuinely asks her whats wrong. Ahh and theyre holding hands. Dream couple.Umibozu is... Interesting. LOL. To each their own. A new mystery character appears and hugs Risa! She said she didnt have any relationships in the past so my guess is its an old classmate that has feelings for her or her brother. Looking forward to next episode!,watchinganime,d27m5tj,2,t5_33old

7531326,0,t3_4ihvsi,Its super painful watching Risa grieving over this. And watching Otani brush her off like that. I can relate too well to both sides of this situation. FOLEVER!The truth comes out. He broke up with her because he couldnt stop worrying about her. And Risa still shows she cares by bringing him a present! That dog though. I love that it was clearly a human voice actor making barking noises. Oh shit. Otani coming in and pinching Kohori. He better step up his game or Kohori really will drag her away from him...Nah maybe not. Risa misses him pretty badly. And vice versa. Awww theyre running off to see each other! Ahhh the hug.  Actually crying. These twooooo. I seem to like you more than I thought. WOW THAT WAS ONLY THE HALFWAY POINT OF THE EPISODE. This episode feels so long. Im happy about that though!New Years time! And now were even further in the year. o.oOmg Suzuki swaying while super sick was actually hilarious while still sad. They wont be able to go to the same school... Ahhh Suzukis promise. These two really didnt have any screen time I feel. So its good to see them getting a little development like Nobu and Nakao did.Oh wow Suzuki is actually pretty selfconscious isnt he? I never would have guessed. I mean he definitely ended up being more timid than we originally thought but to be THAT hard on yourself geez. I know that feel. And Chiharu actually showed her angry side! Suzukis a good guy. He had her best interests in mind all along. Also I just noticed... Chiharu is INCREDIBLY CUTE with glasses. wow.I do like the pacing of this show though. And suddenly the entrance exams were tomorrow. Cut the crap and get straight to the point. We can figure out the inbetween on our own.Otani getting kicked out of his house because of the flu... Poor kid hahaha. GO TO RISAS HOUSE!

7578686,0,t3_4j4npa,I managed to scribble down thoughts as I was waiting for the thread to be posted as incoherent as they may be ha!We pick up this episode with some karaoke playing over a wall of scrolling text which is apparently some discussion on quantum mechanics which Ill leave to others more qualified than myself to parse and critique.As for the karaoke itself it felt out of the blue to me when I watched it in the past but really when compared to Macross whats a little bit of karaoke? It reinforces the budding relationship between Coach and Amano.Moving on we have more silliness that comes with putting a bunch of teenagers in a dorm together even if theyre on a desperate mission to save the world  scary stories and dares during a warp. We meet Smith Toren aka The Hair and Noriko crushes on him hard and fast which is cute.As our two characters bond over cleaning duty were suddenly under attack by presumably space monsters while Captain Tatsumi notes the abnormal aging of Leaf  an ominous portent of things to come.Immediately after the scene where Noriko proclaims the strength of her and Amanos partnership to The Hair Amano drops Noriko as her partner. The emotional lability of the characters in this show is one of my pet peeves but Ive accepted it as a result of the limited number of episodes its working with.With all that build up we finally get into our first battle with the space monsters! What were treated to is a very unusual fight mostly from the perspective of Noriko inside her cockpit. The whole battle is over before we see anything substantial happen and thats fantastic. Its what I would expect of a total space fight rookie who was selected for her potential rather than actual skill. This battle sequence is one of my favorites of all time due to that sense of dread and helplessness. Were never explicitly told that Smith died this episode  no blood curdling scream no dramatic explosion just dead silence. Terrifying.Of course this sequence does nothing but further pummel Norikos sense of self worth. Thankfully she doesnt wallow in self pity for too long namely because the length of the show dictates that she cant!The show is about to reach full speed next episode thatll be fun!Gunbuster in the past gave me fits because I couldnt decide what I thought of it. I enjoyed it but there were several things which peeved me. As I watched the first three episodes this time around those things were still there but I cant help but feel the rush of nostalgia which has made everything much more enjoyable so far. Maybe Im just less picky these days.Edit editing is hard on mobile,watchinganime,d33ns7f,1,t5_33old

I really liked the episodes that focused on Yuri Fee and Edel  the developments seemed to flow naturally. But then we had the unnecessary butchering of the characters of Claire and Chen Shing whose roles ended up feeling really flat and disappointing. And what was with the ninjas? They had one silly episode and then they get unceremoniously killed off! In the end I guess the biggest issue I had was that the two leads just didnt appeal to me which was a shame. Im not too big a fan of endings that see the characters married off but I can see how that would be satisfying for some. I decided to give this a   since the good and bad amounted to a pretty average show for me overall. Also I have way too many s so Im trying to be more decisive about using more of the scale P,watchinganime,d77cnx4,2,t5_33old
9040450,0,t1_d7yatm8,Yeah I didnt have an issue with it either. It was brutal but honestly par for the course for Jojo. And it doesnt really conflict with the rest of the episode because they confirmed she survived and just rushed to the hospital afterwards. ,watchinganime,d7yio1y,1,t5_33old

9175725,0,t3_55rmdm,Interesting how a fight goes into a second miniarc interested to see how this plays out... At least we know how DArby Jrs Stand works now. He can read their soul to see if theyre lying.I like how he reads their soul. YES YES YES YES YES YES! No matter how Jotaro changes it up his soul keeps confidently saying yes. Im not sure what his trick is either... I know his hat was just a red herring though. Man I love how Jotaro made both the DArby brothers admit defeat for stupid reasons hahaha. That was awesome it was Joseph playing. P Very clever! Good ol family bonding.Hahahahaha when Jotaro is asking DArby questions. Your left? No no no no no. Your right? No no no no no. Bboth?! Yes yes yes yes YES! Are you really going to ora ora me?! Yes yes yes oh my god!omg our next user is Vanilla Ice lmfao thats amazing. Or not....?! He just killed himself for Dio. And he had such an amazing looking Stand too. Oh hes not dead. That was Dio testing him I guess. Pretty badass honestly. His Stand ate itself?? wow okGod damnit. Joestar asked us to do this but lets do the opposite of what they wanted. I do like their resolve of not going back to save one of the others if something happens to them. Every man for himself for the sake of defeating Dio. Really beats those shows where someone cant fight to their full potential because theyre protecting someone. Yet at the same time it really shows the bond and trust these three have built up. Oh wow they dealt with a Stand user without much effort or time. And then Avdol reads a terrifying message... And does exactly what it says not to do. Hes really really bad at following directions. And Avdol dies... This time for real Id guess. Well shit. Or hes in this void of darkness until Vanilla Ice is defeated. Hard to tell. But after the last death Im skeptical.,watchinganime,d8f39qb,1,t5_33old

I would disagree about Nunnallys survival. I can understand why people might not like the idea at face value but strictly speaking it doesnt contradict anything. If you really want a detailed explanation about how she survived look up  Theory of a Live Girl in Google. It was based only on the evidence available around this same point in the original broadcast thus its not spoilers for future episodes.,watchinganime,dafqnox,1,t5_33old

10526955,0,t3_5qpkaz,My favorite thing about this show is its use of colors. Poppy colors are wacky futuristic. But muted pastel colors are dystopian aging. Scenes overloaded with different colors make you feel disoriented... In every scene the colors are designed to encapsulate the emotions of the characters and tone of the situation.We like the MC still dont know very much about this universe and thats what makes it such a wild trip.,watchinganime,dd1cffk,2,t5_33old
10813371,0,t1_ddvabew,Episode   C Class LicenseMore from our comedy duo which really helps Ippo with his nerves. See? These two do have their place! But of course... Takamura has to come along and make it worse. WHAT IS THIS FACE OMG.Everyone here looks so strong but Ippos going to end up being the strongest one here. He has no reason to worry. And that cute bike girl is back! But only long enough for Takamura to ruin things. POh my god that guy behind Ippo so scary looking. xD Hes probably not that bad of a dude though knowing anime tropes. And theyre the same weight roughly so theyre probably going to have to end up fighting each other.The reporter is back! I like this dude. Hes going to be Ippos biggest fan isnt he? He was there from the start and hes going to follow him right into his professional career.Ippo makes everyone underestimate him because hes a nervous wreck and klutz haha. Hes made a friend but THATS NOT WHY YOURE HERE. Remember that dude! I think thats what the scary looking dude was trying to say by... Breaking the handshake and punching the wall. Take this more seriously would you? Im trying to go pro here. Oh god now that hes in a real ring hes totally nervous. His first fight here. Mumbling to himself which is a sign hes taking this seriously. That fight was all we needed to prove hes taking it seriously too! He sent that guy flying! Seriously! That was awesome. His training really has paid off and it shows. Everyones in shock and I feel hes really got the scary guys attention now.Now his friend is in the ring and hes against the scary dude. That smile. Yeuch. That stance... Seems to be the guy the reporter is interested in... The fuck? Flicker jabs? His arm is like a whip because of how fast it moves. And it comes from every direction. Okay I was wrong so this guy isnt just creepy hes a monster too. Shoving the referee away just to keep laying punches in. Thats cold. I much prefer the this guy looks creepy but is a good guy trope.We have a name. Mashiba. As long as I exist... you wont reach the top of the featherweight class. Thats some confidence hes got there and a challenge if I ever heard one. Ippos words seem to have really interested Mashiba though. That smile at the end wasnt his usual creepy smile but a real genuine grin. Like lets see what this kid can do!Ippo has his license and the Chief couldnt be happier! That smile.  lt And hes just like wait no time to get serious and hes already gone. xD You can see the bully followed him to the gym too. So he finally knows what Ippos been up to. And now theyve ambushed him. o Oh no... Theyre messing with his license. How swiftly he dodged the punches and grabbed the license. I didnt start for a pitiful reason like revenge! Is this it? Is this where they become his fans? The lead bully seems the most fleshed out characterdesignwise. So Im sure hell be an important and recurring character if not all of them.Hahaha him and Takamura fighting through the sandbag. I love it. Fujiis here with a video... Of Mashiba? Nope Miyata! Just to show hes doing great. And now one of Mashiba? Yep! Mashiba seems to be Ippos next big hurdle while Miyata is his final goal. His debut match is just around the corner? GEE I WONDER WHO HIS OPPONENT WILL BE. Its not like theyve built up Mashiba this past episode or anything. xD watch it not be him,watchinganime,ddvbmz4,1,t5_33old

11306912,0,t3_61d9cz,. Im hoping Texhnolyze wins since it seems to be right up my alley and it doesnt seem too long still a little long but not by too much. Ive been interested in it for awhile also so I wanna check it out.. Shigofumi seems really interesting going by the description and its the shortest. Its  just due to Texhnolyze being an option.. GTO. I watched a bit of it a few years ago and although I loved it I lost interest for some reason. Its the longest option by far and Ive already been going through a few long series lately so I just want something semishort at the very least.,watchinganime,dfdmdsi,1,t5_33old
11426335,0,t3_6336gq, It was nice to see the end of the Sendo match again.  It was mostly the same but there were some changed shots.   I wasnt expecting it to be such a direct sequel.  It just continued immediately where the last episode finished.  I dont mind though.  It just feels like another really long episode in the series.   I like how they are including more stuff about the old boxers.  It is interesting to learn more about when the coach was a boxer.   Sanada is a pretty interesting character.  He is the extreme for the intelligent type but he also has a fierce passion.  He definitely seems as intimidating as the best of them.   Way to go Takamura.  Get Ippo to finally tell Kumi how he feels.   The arm wrestling scene was fun.  It has all the normal antics but it also shows how far Ippos strength has grown.  He was able to pretty much match Takamura even though Takamura is in a higher weight class.   Ah the classic confession tease.  This one was particularly frustrating.  Kumi even gave him a second chance and basically told him point blank that she feels the same way but he still couldnt do it.  I have a feeling that he will say it at the end of the movie or something.   Uh oh Ippo seems really on edge.  That could be bad for him.   The fight was really good.  I would say it was just shy of being as good as the second Sendo fight.  I liked the medical analysis Sanada had during the fight.  It was cool to have a realistic explanation of the effects of blows.  There was some of that during the series but it was a lot more prevalent in this.  I also really liked how much the coach motivated him to continue fighting.  It really shows how strong their bond is.  Also the end was similar to the second Sendo fight.  However in this both of them were left standing with no energy but still tried to throw punches at each other.  It was nice to see Ippo defend his title.   Aw Sanadas going quit boxing?  Thats too bad but I guess that is his decision to make.  It really would be hard to pursue both at the same time.  Its a miracle he even got that far in the first place.   Man Ippo still couldnt say he loves Kumi.  Kumi was able to but Ippo just thanked her and didnt give much of a response.  I suppose she probably already knows but it still would have been nice to hear him say it.  Im curious to see what their relationship will be like next season.   Overall I liked the movie a lot.  However it really didnt feel like a movie.  It was more like one long episode.  I was expecting a different style and structure compared to the series but this really could have been in the series if they wanted it to be.  Oh well it was still good.  Im glad that Ippo got to defend his title and Im looking forward to see whats next.,watchinganime,dfr5w6r,1,t5_33old
