1210838,0,t1_ci5u3ve,I just listened to For the love of numbers lol is that one you mean?,Radiolab,ci5u5vf,2,t5_2rssh
3164969,0,t1_copj7nk,Thanks for the comedy ideas Ive been looking to expand to some funny podcasts beyond Wait Wait Dont Tell Me.,Radiolab,coq1qez,1,t5_2rssh
4930463,0,t1_cufqbi7,Hold out  it goes between personal interest and science. Gets better.,Radiolab,cug0vk3,1,t5_2rssh
5200314,0,t1_cvcoy5w,Yeah Ive listened to Darkode which was great  my issue is more that theyre just repackaging old content as if it were new. So it doesnt seem to be a seasonal break thing  otherwise they wouldnt be putting up new fulllength episodes at all. Which would suck but Id understand good stories take time! I miss the hourlong themed episodes like Blame and Patient Zero and Colors. I love having the shorter podcasts in between to tide me over but I dont like when those short podcasts are slapped together and presented as something new. They did this with Eye in the Sky as well but all of those stories were newer.,Radiolab,cvctxd8,4,t5_2rssh
6906381,0,t1_d0yp9g8,Yeah I normally dont find myself agreeing with Mr Krulwich but in this case I thought he was really good. Being separate from any one identity is sorta the whole point. Youre making the argument in such a way that its not susceptible to ad hominems the validity of the argument is independent from who is making it.Yeah... If the next few podcasts arent of a higher quality I might unsub for a while and see what the word is in a few months.,Radiolab,d0z5ory,18,t5_2rssh
6912931,0,t1_d0zka6u,I agree with you. This was a great opportunity for... ironically... a debate! But they didnt let it happen. ,Radiolab,d0zwhly,26,t5_2rssh
7131533,0,t3_4bk1qh,Most apps handle this Im on Android and use BeyondPod.  But Radiolab is one of the ones I do not speed up.  There is so much care involved with the production its crafted like a song almost.  Now Dan Carlin Joe Rogan Tim Ferris I speed up.,Radiolab,d1orxrh,1,t5_2rssh
8712911,0,t1_d6upqsn,If you go back to the discussion of that episode on this sub most people were upset over how Jad and Robert didnt challenge the validity of the tactic being used and Robert was even shut down from his line of questioning by the kid he was interviewing.,Radiolab,d6ur1dw,2,t5_2rssh
10192279,0,t3_5lunoq,If youd like to listen to a improv comedy podcast based on the same concept I recommend this episode with Claudia ODoherty and Lauren Lapkus ,Radiolab,dbzcnm0,1,t5_2rssh
11396900,0,t1_dfnt6pe,Cops have a proud history of lying tweaking facts in their reports to support their claims and justify their otherwise unjustifiable actions. Thats why having bodycams have been so effective and why cops seems to despise being filmed. And why whenever something bad happens their cameras coincidentally go out.,Radiolab,dfntnmz,2,t5_2rssh
