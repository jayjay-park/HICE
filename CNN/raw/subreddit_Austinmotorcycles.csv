97229,0,t3_1v7jyv,Hah Id be a speed limit doubling retard but I try to avoid that in light of the recent ticket I got and the increasing number of speedtraps I see along the road.However on Lime Creek it takes a lot of concentration to not go over the limit by much so most of the time I just dont care since it doesnt have heavy traffic anyway.,Austinmotorcycles,cephzdx,2,t5_2vgh9

492267,0,t1_cfw1t1i,Ive got a GS and been super happy with it. Same dropped several times story I think Im the rd or th owner. Another huge pro Its so easy to work on!I tried to recharge the battery and adjust the idle on my friends ninja and I practically had to take half the damn thing apart. By comparison the battery on the GS can be accessed by removing the seat with just the bikes key. The idle is adjustable by hand without removing anything though you should probably wait till the engine cools down... learned that one the hard way.,Austinmotorcycles,cfw82xx,1,t5_2vgh9

911855,0,t3_24k46e,yea. when you use MX boots you usually need to adjust your brake and shift lever. I had to adjust the shifter on my DRZ to accommodate my boots.  plus your boots are new so they need to be broken into they are stiff now. If its too bad you may need a longer shifter. Break your boots in adjust your shifter ride with them. you will eventually get used to it.Also you dont need to fully put your foot under the shifter to upshift. most of the time i up shift by puttin my boot on the side and theres enough friction to pull up the shifter.,Austinmotorcycles,ch7xmos,2,t5_2vgh9
1043842,0,t1_chmxnin,Since I have an  I think my base gasket should be fine...IIRC they switched to metal base gaskets in . I think the cam chain tensioner is the only place that is leaking right now. Ive heard of oil leaking from the hoses that lead to the radiator and i suppose that the head gasket could be leaking too but its kinda hard to tell since my fork seals have been leaking fork oil on everything theyre next up on my list but are of lesser importance for right now.

Also youll realize after a while whats important for you and what is not.Otherwise the Honda NCx is a really good bike for newer riders.

8749161,0,t1_d6za7h5,  At least you were able to call for a tow.  If youd said something flagged someone down I or any passing rider would have run down to the gas station and brought you back some waters or whatever.Just curious whenever I get into a situation I never know which tow company to call.  Who did you go with and do you recommend them? did they handle the bike well?Ive ended up calling  before and asking for a local tow company and when they ask which one I say just pick one at random.  But if you had a good experience Ill put their number in my speed dial.I ride LCR enough that Im pretty sure Ill wreck on it one of these days.  Would be good to know a reputable tow company to call to bring the bike back to my apt for analysis and tearsOn the FZ thing... I was originally looking for a Honda  but they all sold quickly. Id seen the Euro? naked FZ in pictures and thought it would be awesome so I expanded my search to an FZ.  Ended up buying my bike about  weeks before Yamaha released the FZ and FZ.  The FZ specs were lbs lighter and a couple more horsepower. But the FZ is a fun bike and if I ever need more power I can just swap sprockets to do dank whoolies. ,Austinmotorcycles,d6zatnd,1,t5_2vgh9
