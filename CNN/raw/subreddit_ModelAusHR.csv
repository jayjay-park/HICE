You havent moved it and hence the exemption from the adjournment standing order isnt properly moved or voted on and hence you cant avoid adjournment. Here is and I quote what you posted for the Marriage Equality bill so for the third time I suggest you use this againgt I declare the bill to be urgent and I move That the bill be considered urgent and that the bill be now read a second time without adjournment.If you wish to include a reason for urgency it should go in your speech.,ModelAusHR,csk9dw1,2,t5_37tyx

4676568,0,t3_3f03v9,Thank you Mr Speaker.These changes are necessary to maintain interest and engagement in our modelparliament. Many of us remember the initial twomonth lead into the first election which was thankfully shortened drastically. A swift exciting election will help boost numbers.What is missing from our electoral reforms is the issues with wildly unbalanced voting power state by state. A vote in my electorate is worth two or more relative to Sydney Urban or Brisbane and Surrounds. More must be done to correct this imbalance in future.For now though I support the governments changes and I also commend them to the House.Phyllicanderer Member for Northern TerritoryEdit darn signature,ModelAusHR,ctk148a,3,t5_37tyx

Very little was said at the second reading and I suspect this was because many of us just thought it so obviously necessary.

5165165,0,t1_cv8j45n,Mr Speaker the conflict in Syria region has been devastating. Combat in the streets mass executions and bombs threaten men women and children who are now fleeing for their very lives.This is a crisis members of the house and I urge this house acknowledge that. History will acknowledge that Mr Speaker and history will remember those who turned their backs on the refugees the hungry the sick and the hopeless. But Australia will not be one of those Mr Speaker no. It just isnt in our character. Thats why I know this house is going to support this motion. Syrian refugees. That is how many we ask that this house agree to grant sanctuary. A mere drop in the ocean of the  million displaced by the conflict. Yet every one we take every one is one less who has to suffer.One less little boy.One less little girl.One less Father one less mother one less mama and one less papa.In all these numbers we must never forget that each individual is a human being. A person with feelings and hopes and dreams. Each one feels love and pain and the joy of laughter.We ask in this motion for  million in emergency funding to the UNHCR for food water and other basic needs for refugees. Thats six times less than what we afford to our arts and culture development. We ask that the government implement a cultural integration program to ease the shock of adjusting to life here in Australia. Things such as the language barrier religious difference and the nature of our democratic capitalist society pose big difficulties to refugees settling here in Australia and will need support.Lastly we ask that the government also accompany the aforementioned integration plan with a public awareness campaign to inform the Australian public about the sudden intake of refugees. It is important that the public understand their situation and take it into consideration when dealing with the sometimes frustrating task of interacting with someone from a culture hugely different from your own.This motion is about giving people a chance at life Mr Speaker. May it never be said that in their hour of need Australia turned her back on the refugees fleeing from the Syrian regional conflict.Thank you.lurkerMember for Melbourne SurroundsShadow Minister of EqualityShadow Minister of Indigenous AffairsShadow Minister of Immigration,ModelAusHR,cv8ldq1,5,t5_37tyx

5622438,0,t1_cwty26x,Advice from the ClerkThe bills should be taken as is. The flaws in the bills give the other players and parties something to debate and something to amend. The High Court will continue to have nothing to do if the government can use speeches as a magic wand and there will be no way of holding policies to account if speeches can be claimed as laws. In fact we wouldnt need bills we would just work off the spin in the press releases. But thats moot in regards to many of ufuns remarks that seem to pick up on points of policy that are not addressed by the speeches let alone the bills. The government can rubber stamp the bills if it wants but the opposition high court and community may not be convinced. Edit At this point members are debating whether the bills have merit and  foreshadowing amendmentsconsideration in detail. That is the second reading is just a preliminary vote not the one that makes it pass the house. The parliament is meant to be a place of debate and scrutiny not a boring free ride for whoever won an election  years ago.,ModelAusHR,cwu0mfk,4,t5_37tyx
5627171,0,t1_cwtvn7e,Thank you Mr Speaker.November the th is a day with as much significance as ANZAC Day when it comes to remembering all of the people whose lives were taken by war. It marks the end of the Great War the first war to touch every corner of the globe a war that by itself with a horrific death toll to match.  million military deaths and  million civilian deaths occurred between the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in  and Armistice Day on November  .During this war we are all aware of the Australian and New Zealand contribution in the  failed campaign in Gallipoli on the th we should take the time to remember those who fought in further theatres in Europe.The Somme Offensive was the scene of what some described as the worst  hours in Australias history the Battle of Fromelles. Over  Australians in the th Division were lost in the Allied offensive against what was erroneously thought to be weak German defences many men died in German counterattacks which took back the ground the Australians had gained in what German officers described as a senseless attack.Throughout the rest of the Battle of the Somme the Battle of Verdun and other theatres of battle in World War I ANZAC troops fought bravely in what turned out to be the war that nearly ended imperialism.We should also take time to remember all those who died and were affected by the Second World War. No conflict has ever taken so many lives as World War II and the horrors it brought should be remembered so they can be learnt from when we consider the nature of what humans can do to each other.Mr Speaker finally we should take a moment tomorrow to thank those who have served in our nations Defence Force the Member for Western Australia among them. Their duty shall always be valued.Tomorrow at the Australian War Memorial I will be spending my time reflecting on the sacrifice of all of the soldiers who have died defending Australia and its values and the desire to not see an Australian defence force member die through our governments choices.Thank you Mr Speaker I commend this motion to the House.The Hon.
