You could also try using Burp Proxy or Fiddler which both have relatively simple interfaces and I believe make it very clear which packet you sent and which was the reply .

You should be able to get into incident response given your masters in securitycryptography but you are likely still looking at close to entry level jobs at this point if you have no experience either direct experience or related experience you can use. So basically you just need to start applying for jobs and work your way up. In the tech field a masters degree is not going to shoot you to the top on its own. Generally a tech masters degree is best when you are reinforcing  adding to existing skills and work experience using it to get you farther ahead.

But I will say this though they are probably the only ones who are encouraging folks to take IT tests in the practical way open book. It encourages folks to actually learn the methods as opposed to just memorizing the material and going into the test. I was severely disappointed in tests like the CCFP and CHFI because of that.

If she knows then she doesnt need the files. And if she suspects then trust in the relationship is already gone. Either way she should seek legal counsel and not a forensic expert.. Strange file formats?  Let the attorney subpoena the password.. Somehow she discovered the files  How did she get the files? Property theft or digital trespassing could be really bad for her.  E.g. if she copied them from his computer then thats theft and digital trespassing a felony.  You certainly dont want to be in possession of stolen data. Even if its from her husband.  And if she did get it legitimately then the attorney will have a better idea for handling the files.. Now imagine... Thats speculation. Focus on the facts. Running wild with your imagination wont help her case.Like others have said Run away. Dont get involved without being retained by an attorney first. If youre not under the supervision of legal counsel then anything you discover could be tainted and thrown out.
