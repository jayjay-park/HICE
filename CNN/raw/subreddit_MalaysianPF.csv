While GST implementation and the slowdown will mean the rate is unlikely to go up in  their need to maintain reserves and the alreadyhigh debt rate amongst Malaysians means the rate may not go down either. I believe BNMs move of not raising interest rates back in  was a mistake and well be feeling the repercussions of it this year.,MalaysianPF,cnizba6,2,t5_35kex
6526126,0,t1_cz9wgf9,A big mistake for fresh working people like us well  year working for me is seeing your income in larger sums like  a month. But break it down to daily numbers its only  a day and use that as a gauge  not the large initial sum.All of this prior to deduction from rent bills loans intended savings estimated tollsgas etc. After you deduct your daily spendable money might just have about  a day. From there it varies lets say you only spend  today you can bring the balance of  from today to tomorrow so you can spend  on stuff OR put that balance aside as savings and watch your savings just soar!Eventually you can properly analyze if that RM ringgit dinner at Rakuzen with your friends is within your spendable budget or not . If it is great youll be alright! If its not then its not worth it or you might have to sacrifice things down the line.,MalaysianPF,czucqj4,1,t5_35kex

10876576,0,t3_5vfqjo,Hi. Do I need to have emergency cash first or put my monthly saving in asb? I planned to have  months salary as emergency cash right now Im on two months. Im asking this because emergency cash is important because easy to withdraw. But it sit there doing nothing. Since asb can withdraw within a day except weekend is it better to put in asb? ,MalaysianPF,de1uat3,3,t5_35kex
