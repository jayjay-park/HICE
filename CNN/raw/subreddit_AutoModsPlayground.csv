2538846,0,t1_cmpyeq0,Well yeah its definitely more fun especially if itd reply from an arsenal of witty comments but what I mean is this person X comments something for instance a question about SHSH blobs person Y calls uAutoModerator by mentioning it in a reply to that comment uAutoModerator scans the parent comment and if necessary replies to it uAutoModerator gives feedback to person Y and thanks them for their help,AutoModsPlayground,cmpyopd,1,t5_358v5
2560659,0,t1_cmst7jg,The way I have it set up now the user gets a DM from AutoMod explaining why their commentpost was removed. This was my work around to letting the user know why their comment was removed and not cluttering up the thread. So why yes the user will still get the notification my hope is that over time people would stop commenting just a persons username  but then again I may be holding redditors to too high a standard if that makes sense.,AutoModsPlayground,cmstcs6,1,t5_358v5
