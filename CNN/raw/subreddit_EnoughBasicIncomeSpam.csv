Gary Johnson proposes it through prebates and Miltion Friedman and Walter Williams advocated it through negative income tax. There is good reason for their advocacy.  From a practical perspective basic income is much better then restrictive welfare programs that encourage people to remain in poverty  in return for the security of the state. A basic income would only be enough to cover the very bare necessities of living. Theres no other way to the state could finance it without hyperinflation. With basic income alone there would be enough incentive to still work for entertainment travel aesthetics and whatever else.There are good arguments against basic income but they need to be more precise and direct then shouting socialism. Its not a dirty word for the many anxious and desperate out there. They seek security not ideology. EDIT Spelling Errors,EnoughBasicIncomeSpam,chvxpwo,2,t5_31pcd
