180892,0,t3_1w4q3a,The thing that I think is really unfair with Rose isnt just being kept out of the hall its the extent of his ban  his name or jersey number cant even be displayed in Great American Ballpark. I think its ridiculous that the Reds arent allowed to honor one of their greatest hometown heroes. Sosa and Bonds and McGwire will be kept out of the Hall by voters just like Rose but their fans and ballparks are still allowed to recognize them in their own way. Cardinals fans can see McGwires name and number honored inside the park  hell they can see MCGWIRE himself sitting in the visitors dugout during home games against the Dodgers. Cincinnati isnt allowed to honor Rose in the way that we deserve to though. ,NLCentral,cez1g36,1,t5_2z8qx
184814,0,t1_cezeec9,The first baseman market isnt too appealing either. Hopefully we can swing a trade for someone decent mid season without selling the farm. ,NLCentral,cezhkeo,3,t5_2z8qx
189899,0,t1_cezvg6j,From what Ive heard it wont be coming for a while. Still I would argue that baseball isnt unique in that one player wont make or break a team. Take a look at football for instance. A team can have a great QB but if they dont have a good offensive line or great receivers then having an amazing QB could mean nothing. But that being said I would rather be the team that can afford to buy Peyton Manning than the team who cant afford him. No one piece makes a team but being able to afford awesome pieces makes you better as a team. If New York can afford amazing players XYZ and Houston can only afford half of player X than that seems like itll never pan out in favor of Houston.,NLCentral,cf02i2j,1,t5_2z8qx

286792,0,t1_cfafqlh,I think espn got that about right maybe th. Our bullpen was a huge issue last year and the cubs would have won many more games without them blowing up late into games but they have addressed those issues so that should be at least  more wins. The cubs are going to be better than the astros white sox marlins as a pure given. Plus Philadelphia could just collapse under its own old age and the twins i imagine are still going to get smacked around because its not exactly easy coming from the worst pitching in the entire mlb. I think the cubs will be have  losses give or take a fewthis year and i actually do see improvement.  ,NLCentral,cfahnjw,2,t5_2z8qx
315407,0,t1_cfd8k4n,The FO wont give up the compensation pick required to sign Morales.  No way no how.  Also he is a Scott Boras client.  When have you ever seen a Boras guy take a belowmarket deal?Also a full season of Jordy Mercer at SS is going to be better than people are expecting.  Basically playing anybody except Clint Barmes is going to improve the offense.  Clint will still get his starts GB heavy pitching staff but he might only be in there  of the time as well as late in the game.  I wouldnt want to see what they would have to give up to acquire Cabrera or Ramirez.  That farm system is going to help feed talent for the next  years.  No sense in blowing it up for a shortsighted win now move.  You see where that kind of thinking got the Brewers worst farm system in the game.,NLCentral,cfdgm1o,2,t5_2z8qx

1241738,0,t3_28asu0,I think you underestimate this pitching staff. Estrada a serviceable no  arm in past years and he may be replaced by one of our young arms lighting it up in AAA is the only major weakness. The bullpen is doing extremely well and they have wang using up a spot with no return. Our bats are fluky as hell but if they stay relatively healthy they wont be a problem either. Im not sure about the Cardinals bats though. From what Ive seen of the Cardinals this year the pitching staff is excellent as usual but the bats are not very good. That may not keep up but the Cards have been letting major bats leave in recent years and the replacements havent produced as of yet ,NLCentral,ci9b7uz,6,t5_2z8qx
