10398,0,t1_ceflov3,I think the oline would have given us a running game with MillerThomas hell a full back would have been nice too.  Im not entirely convinced we didnt have a full back because of Ireland.  I still believe that was a coaching decision because if we wanted one I find it extremely hard to believe we wouldnt be able to find one.With McKinnie Incognito Pouncey Jerry and Martin I think our line would have been serviceable.  Not great but certainly better then what it was.  I cant place  of the oline problem on Ireland.  Albert for more than we would have spent on Long plus a draft pick nd round Jamar Talyor was a bad idea.  Outside of Albert there wasnt an answer to LT that was better then Martin at the time.  Martin looked good through camp and preseason.  RT was between Clabo and Winston.  Clabo was a former pro bowler with experience in our zone blocking scheme.  On paper it should have worked it took him half the season to get adjusted.  He brought in competition for Jerry Jerry won out somehow.  The only thing I think he could have done differently would have been to get Lane Johnson instead of Dion Jordan or not moved up and taken an olinemen with the nd pick we traded.  After the big  LTs though last one being Lane I dont think it would have been a huge improvement.  Bullygate destroyed an already questionable line thats not on him.  Thats on coaching for not controlling their locker room.,miamidolphins,cefma7y,1,t5_2s20n

You cant argue we dont have more talent then they do.,miamidolphins,cefq5cb,3,t5_2s20n
14249,0,t1_ceg1439,He neglected the oline.  He let Long go which is fine but he expected Martin to step in and play LT.  Martin had issues long before the bullying stuff he was never any good.  The line was a clear problem going into the regular season.Wallace was pretty much the consensus wreckless offseason acquisition.  Hes not a true number one.  His balls skills are below advertised and hes even shown serious red flags with regards to his effort.  Hes a one trick pony.  Dolphins fans didnt want to hear it during the offseason but it was the truth.  Dont blame it on Dawn Aponte.The  draft was not good.  It was painfully obvious that Dion Jordan was a work in progressluxury pick.  He was undersized coming out of college and because of his injuries he was unable to put on the weight.  This was all well known when he was drafted.  On top of that we already had Vernon apparently Ireland completely underestimated him.  The Miami Dolphins traded up for the rd overall pick and got zero production out of it.  They didnt get any production out of any of the other picks either.,miamidolphins,ceg21p3,1,t5_2s20n

I agree to an extent that it affected our season but I think thats partly the Dolphins own fault front office. The fact that players served up more media sound bites following the whole debacle brought on way more attention and put players that were actually playing and not JTRI in the spotlight when they shouldnt have been easy to say ongoing investigation not involving me no comment. Speaks to some of our organizational control issues in my opinion.Anyway the medias not going anywhere anytime soon as annoying as it can be during the bad times just need to play the game better and it looks like Ross did for once here.,miamidolphins,cfdpu2h,1,t5_2s20n

Mayock is the most accurate and even he says some asinine things sometimes.I really disagree about Shazier. I think hes a great prospect but doesnt fit our scheme at all and I really dont want us to take him. We need a bona fide run stuffer who can lead a defense not a sideline to sideline guy like we took at  last year.A lot of people have us taking Moses who I really like actually but Jesus hes a second round talent with upside. Hickey better not panic and reach because it looks like the PERFECT fit isnt going to be there at  anymore. Gddamnit I wanted to replace Martin with Martin.Were in a really tough position in the first with the way the board is shaping up. Im really hoping someone wants to trade up for our spot because if they dont the top  OTs arent there and Mosley ClintonDix and Pryor are off too... who the fuck do we take? It would be a huge reach a luxury pick or a miscast in our system.Moses? Probably the best option but hes at best worth a late st.Kouandijo? Huge injury concerns it would be like flipping a coin. I wasnt all that impressed with him to begin with.Sua Filo or Yankey?

1898837,0,t1_ckhznjz,The streams that I was posting on rCFB were from Neulion who also provides streams for NFL NHL NBA UFC MLS and many more.  Unfortunately most of these streams are actually encrypted with keys that rotate every  minutes.  The links that I was posting yesterday consisted of streams that for one reason or another were not encrypted at all.Now technically it is possible to stream every NFL game as well as the other sports however it requires your own web server and a little skill.  I have this set up but I have to daisy chain a list of vulnerabilities read mistakes by their engineers in order to make this work.The whole reason I started researching how to get these games was so I could watch the blackhawks since they are blacked out in my town whenever they play on WGN but even if I purchased a subscription to NHL Gamcenter the games would be blacked out on there too.  If I were to release the code required to watch the games for other leagues then Neulion would likely figure out how Im doing it and fix their mistakes.It is for that reason that I have decided not to disclose the steps required in order to watch the other sport games today or any time in the future because Id like to be able to watch the Blackhawks.  Trust me even if I did release the steps required  of Reddit wouldnt have the resources required to watch the games anyways and I dont want to give out the links that my server generates because I feel like that would be crossing a legal line since Id be rebroadcasting their feeds and I dont get to get myself into any kind of trouble.I hope you understand.

2368691,0,t3_2mhvnc,The way I see our path to the playoff right now is likely the same way many others do aiming for  expecting losses to Denver and the Patriots and winning the rest of our games. Wed probably win out on tiebreakers for the sixth seed in such a situation. But thats assuming that Kansas City is the fifth seed wild card where they have the headtohead tiebreaker against us.After the unexpected Denver loss to St. Louis this week the Chiefs have to look ahead at the next two weeks and assume that the division is up for grabs. The Chiefs and Broncos both sit at  right now and heres the remaining schedules for both teams.Week | Broncos | Chiefs|| | Dolphins | Raiders | Chiefs | Broncos | Bills | Cardinals | Chargers | Raiders | Bengals | Steelers | Raiders | ChargersThe Chiefs should beat the Raiders next week putting them at . If we can beat the Broncos potentially minus several key offensive pieces due to injuries this week the Broncos  would face going into Arrowhead in week  half a game back from the Chiefs . A Kansas City home win puts the Chiefs in position to take the AFC West leaving the Broncos to take their place as a wild card seed and leaving us with a headtohead advantage over them.None of that matters if we cant beat the Broncos next week but if we do we should begin rooting for Kansas City to run away with their division so that we can control our own destiny by having headtohead tiebreakers over the other teams in the AFC wild card hunt.The way I see it there are three teams whose records have potential to affect on our playoff chances outside of our own matchups the Chiefs the Broncos and the Patriots. The Ravens pose a threat but only if they beat us to get the headtohead advantage. Otherwise our conference record is a major boon against other teams in the hunt. If we can handle business against the Jets Ravens and Vikings watching the Chiefs Broncos and Patriots could become very interesting for us.,miamidolphins,cm4h8qz,6,t5_2s20n

2527671,0,t1_cmogcuo,gt I dont understand how you can say Tannehill cant throw deep when he has done so consistently but when you have an OL that gives up sacks like candy and a WR Wallace who makes poor attempts at catching the ball like he did today and that what should have been a TD pass during the Jets game Tannehill will never have a deep game.Because hes completed  pass over  yards all season not every one of them is dropped.  That and the ball to Wallace in the end zone was  yards away from him with no way to catch it.  This isnt new he constantly underthrew Wallace last year too.  Tannehill has no deep ball throw thats why our offense is built around him not throwing it.gt We have done nothing to improve the line after Albert went down knowing the backups werent worth a damn.Do you know of some star LT out there that the rest of the NFL doesnt know about?  Our offensive line is a zone blocking scheme which not everyone fits to begin with.  Short of James going down were not reaching in the free agency.  Even Incognito isnt much of a step up from Colledge.  Our offensive line is far from the worst in the league.  Hell Andrew Luck is the most pressured QB in the NFL doesnt seem to stop him does it?gt We also have a issue of abandoning things when they work like today when we stopped running the ball for some reason in the nd half.Because they figured us out.  We couldnt run anymore with all of the pressure they were bringing and our offensive line just couldnt stand up against them.  Not the mention the mounting injuries.gt I think the players are running on empty especially on the DL and would like to see them a bit more fierce like during the Chargers game?The Chargers run a COMPLETELY different offense and the fact the Chargers were down by a lot and basically had to throw which left Wake and Vernon abandoning the run attack and focusing on going after Rivers.  The Ravens had a balanced offense and we had to respect their run game.  The Ravens also have the best offensive line in the NFL.  Our dline wasnt running on empty they just couldnt compete.,miamidolphins,cmoi4jw,3,t5_2s20n
2527729,0,t1_cmog36s,The problem is that unless youre ready to make Lazor your head coach firing Philbin would make retaining Lazor very very unlikely. Most new coaches are inclined to bring in their own guy. Given how much the offense has improved under Lazor its possible that if we were to bring in a defensiveminded coach he might keep Lazor along for consistency if he doesnt have his own guy in mind.,miamidolphins,cmoieda,2,t5_2s20n
2530679,0,t1_cmow2s0,gtWe knew they were going to run we knew they werent going to passWe did not know this. After they didnt even pass the ball late in the ndQ the Jets gave away any chance they had at passing and we made the obvious adjustment. rdQ and thQ we stacked the box and made stops. Our Dline is a passrush dline. Wake and Vernon are edge rushers not power rushers theyre not great at stopping the run on their own. We havent been a good runstopping team all year  games come to mind where we did alright or good so weve needed the safety and LB support in that aspect of our game.,miamidolphins,cmow9sx,2,t5_2s20n

2545027,0,t3_2oky75,Heres what I think happened my lowly two cents from someone who has watched every game this season Dallas Thomas does not belong at RT. Jason Fox or hell Billy Turner should have been brought in after the first  sacks were allowed and one of them should have been given a chance. Dallas was progressing at G and should keep being played there. Hes obviously not the right type of guy to play T. Period. Kevin Coyle is inconsistent and doesnt properly adjust defensive schemes. The defense often looks great to start the game and often falters in the second half. Look at every single loss this season whether close game or blowout. First the blowouts Every single one of them appeared to be a close game until the rd quarter most even until the th. The close ones They all involved a comeback from a good QB and we couldnt adjust our defensive schemes well enough to compete. Our defensive schemes are fairly predictable and a good opposing coach will pick up on how to win at some point during the game. Philip Wheeler needs to go. This one is slightly related to  but only slightly. Many times this season Wheeler has been put manonman in a critical situation and he just cant handle it. Hes paid money at a level that he cannot match with his play. And relating to  he shouldnt be placed in a situation where a good opposing QB can easily exploit his inability to play man coverage look especially at Ravens and Packers games for overwhelming proof. Mike Wallace is not a  million receiver. This was evident many times throughout this season. He doesnt run routes with effort and he displays the same level of effort when the ball comes his way. From lack of ball awareness to coming back for short balls to simply making a play on a catchable ball. The Jets game had a glaring example of this For a pass that surely would have been a touchdown Mike Wallace simply extended one hand out to get it and as the ball bounced out of his hand he simply looked at his hand as if it failed him. Can anyone take a guess what he was doing? My guess is he was trying to posterize a play a la Beckham Jr and showboat. Go back and look at the play and thats exactly how it looks. Either that or he is simply incapable of making an appropriate catch. Look at his routes during the Ravens game. He just isnt putting forth an effort. They need to stop abandoning the run game. Lamar Miller has displayed phenomenal progress this season though hes always had skill and I attribute most of last season to the offensive line and has an impressive yardspercarry average . good for th in the league. However he has only  total carries over  games despite playing every single game. That means Miller gets an average of about  carries per game. Thats it. That is unacceptable! When you dont throw deep thats not the Dolphins thing and thats probably fine if its working you need a proper run game in order to keep the defense honest. Thats just Football . I wish somebody had statistics on rush attempts in the nd half someone probably does because Im willing to bet that the Dolphins are somewhere in the bottom  of NFL teams. Even if as a team you believe your running backs dont do as well later in the game you need to keep at it. Its not even about yards so much as it is about opening up your passing game. Its just ridiculous to basically quit on the run especially when the opposing defense is clearly covering your receivers underneath and putting constant pressure on your QB. Throw the deep ball. I know the Dolphins paid Mike Wallace as the deep threat but he is definitely better served in the  yard range since you cant really expect him to go make a play on the ball which is what you need from true deep threats. Let Landry give it a shot. Start evaluating him from now until the end of the season in the  yard range so you know what you should be looking at in next years draft I already gave my opinion on Mike Wallace. Landry didnt really perform for the draft so there isnt a good yard time for him he strained a hamstring but he has  inch hands and has shown to be a terrific playmaker. Both Wallace and Hartline have done decently with YAC yards after catch this season so we wouldnt lose much there. Wallace clearly isnt producing on the deep ball Tannehill definitely has the arm to get it there he actually has better accuracy deep than Tom Brady this season believe it or not  Tannehill is ranked th on deep passing accuracy per PFF and we lose nothing by going with Landry here. Watch the games this season Jarvis Landry is a playmaker. Let him make plays where the Dolphins need it. This also ties in with my th point because going deep every once in a while helps open up the box and keep the defense from playing too close to the line. Coaching. Besides Bill Lazor OC and John Benton OL coach there are few bright spots on the coaching staff. The DB coaches have done a great job and you cant fault them for significant injuries to that squad depth has to end somewhere. However the defense under Kevin Coyle is predictable there are many times where its obvious Philbin is overriding Lazor on playcalling and its bad and time management is horrendous. And most importantly motivation is pretty lacking. You look at other coaches around the league and theyre emotional and they rile up their players and they are strict and the players respect them. Not so with Joe Philbin. Honestly and many Fins Fans might chastise me for saying this but if I was Stephen Ross Id get rid of Philbin and Coyle bring in Harbaugh if possible though he will likely end up with the Raiders and bring in Rex Ryan at DC. Drop Wheeler next season and start playing Dion Jordan at LB along with Chris McCain. DO NOT EVER DROP CAMERON WAKE INTO PASS COVERAGE AGAIN. Keep Dennis Hickey because he has shown to be a great GM so far. Pick up more OL in the draft a CB a fast WR for deep plays contingent on evaluating Landry see  and draft another QB in the th or th round at least. Let Matt Moore go. Tannehill will be in his th year we have Lazor and Marino on staff and he has plenty of great guidance. Draft a young QB to keep the fire lit and compete for the job. Tannehill is a good quarterback and may be the franchise QB going forward but its always good to keep that competitive fire burning.Anyway thats just my opinion. I could totally be wrong on everything!,miamidolphins,cmqrsfy,1,t5_2s20n

I was really tired when I wrote that so I wasnt sure how valid any of my points were. gtit was just a failed experiment Im fine with Coyle experimenting but dont do it when were trying to make a comeback in an important game coming of a loss. When I was talking about Grimes shadowing a receiver I meant trailing him around the field and playing his side whether it be man or zone. When we didnt have a reliable number two to cover the other side of the field Grimes was allowed to trail the  and it worked really well for us. The whole media thing happened after the week  game. Odrick Wheeler and Vernon all expressed some dislike and distrust for Coyle.

Ideally if Shaq isnt there we move back and take Mckinney but if Thompson is there I think we pull the trigger. He isnt the best fit for our defense seeing as we need a run stopper more than a fast coveragepass rushing linebacker but I think Shaq Thompson is just too big of a playmaker to pass up on.

3498419,0,t3_30bjly,Only real target I see  is Devante Parker.  Both White and Cooper wont make it to that pick and all other options would be huge reaches.Devante Parker might also be a reach .  Hes got impressive combination of size and catching ability with great hands but he has some serious questions about his agility and suddenness that would make me think he might not be able to get a ton of separation at the pro level.  He played slower than his combine .  Though I wouldnt hate the pick if taken  Id be a little concerned.The other choices  Dorial GreenBeckham simply wont be picked by this team.  Physical freak but too many question marks and not a polished receiver Breshad Perriman is not a receiver for the Dolphins.  Fast quick and agile but poor route runner and poor hands.  Thats a big nono for the Dolphins offense  Strong and Agholor I like quite a bit for late st and early nd respectively.  Strong is like a less known version of Parker.  Similar strengths and weaknesses but as a late st rounder offers much better value.  Agholor is the prototypical receiver for the Dolphins offense and a very intriguing candidate.  Smart high character excellent route runner good hands good YAC ability. Agholor reminds me a lot of Greg Jennings.

Jordan has been suspended twice for substance abuse violations and is one more violation away from a yearlong suspension..

4789711,0,t3_3gh1zi,This year things appear on paper to be a bit different. Weve pretty much overhauled our entire receiver corps. Got rid of some expensive dead weight and brought in some young guns that look like they can really help Tannehill spread the ball around. Jarvis Landry is our breakout star. He was a monster rookie receiver last year and if practice is any indication hes going to be a big threat this year. We dropped Wallace something Im glad for to your rival the Vikings who had a big drop last night in preseason that tickled me. We added your aging stud Greg Jennings for some veteran status in the locker room and the supplanted the other receivers with Kenny Stills for speed Jordan Cameron for a big target and picked up another rookie hopeful in the draft in Devante Parker. Our Defense is looking massive with the addition of Suh and some needed line adjustments at LB. We still have some question marks at LB but with the double teams that Suh will be pulling and some moves like Misi in his natural position we should be able to penetrate some O lines. Speaking of Olines.. ours is shaky at best. We dont have any depth to one of the positions that gets the most injuries. Brandon Albert an anchor on our line is nursing a knee injury that everyone says will be  by the season but hes still kind of hobbling. We are weak at the Guard position. Tannehill is a great quarterback but theres only so much you can do when youre running for your life. Everyone appears hopeful that well bring in Evan Matthews but hell have some serious cap implications for the next  years if we sign him for big money.We have a GOAT punter in Brandon Fields. Were uncertain at kicker for the first time in a few decades. Philbin has drawn some criticism but I think hes growing just as if players do. Hes taken some knocks for his calm demeanor and hopefully he can learn from that to take a few more risks this year. Im not completely sold on his style but Im not against the consistency either. We need stability above a lot of other things.Our GM has been making really good moves and Hickey has been working well with Tannenbaum our VP of Operations to bring in some good talent. Theyre finally an exciting group of people in the front office something were not used to. I think that kind of catches up this year.,miamidolphins,ctya5xo,1,t5_2s20n

4920638,0,t1_cuernpv,gt Thats cool. His contract is worth M.Your point?gt A starter for a few games. Trading Jennings wouldnt hopefully free up cap space it definitely would.  yr old guard over a  yr old WR. I think we need more guard help than receiver help.You misunderstood what I said. Obviously trading Jennings would relieve cap space. What I meant is that youre suggesting we trade Jennings free up his cap space and HOPE that Mathis signs with us. My big issue with what you want to do is that in no way does trading Jennings assure us of getting Mathis. Lets say you trade Jennings and free up the cap space. Cool now we have the money to sign Mathis but what if Mathis decides to sign somewhere else? Then you lose out on Jennings AND Mathis.Also I think youre severely undervaluing Jennings. Hes old but hes still a good WR that can be a really solid weapon for Tannehill.gt Same goes for all of the guards on our roster protecting our M qb.What you fail to mention is that those guards play on the same line as a pro bowl LT a pro bowl C and an up and coming RT. Guard is a weak spot for sure but the other spots on the line can help cover those deficiencies.gt Trading for Greg Jennings isnt going crazy. Not really a blockbuster trade.Never claimed it was a blockbuster trade I just dont think the Packers would make a desperation trade for a WR when chances are they already have a guy on their roster who can be a decent WR. Randall Cobb is currently their WR with Adams as the WR. Thats better than what most teams have even without Nelson.,miamidolphins,cues9uh,2,t5_2s20n

Hes not an elite QB until he gets this facet of the game down. Has he gotten better? Yes.gtThe West Coast offense requires you to make these throws. Our offense needs him to make these attempts.

5180349,0,t3_3lymfj,With an injured shady our under performing run defense shouldnt be exploited as much. Our pass rush could come alive especially Wake against arguably the worst RT hes seen so far this year. That forces Tyrod into mistake and turnovers will be a huge step towards winning. The Bills have an amazing defense. There arent many holes especially with Aaron Williams coming back from the terrible looking accident last week. Under Rex were going to see the same exotic blitzes weve been seeing from the Jets. We need to stretch the field horizontally in order to minimize that. If DVP Matthews Landry and Cameron can be effective in the short passing game it should simplify their defense a lot. Running the ball would be nice. James had an awful game against JAX both with penalties and blocking. If he and Albert come back to their normal selves we could get the running game going at least enough to compliment the pass. ,miamidolphins,cvaf740,2,t5_2s20n

Keeping the amount of money being earned above the amount of money being spent  costearnings ratio is what I think its called.  Im sure Steve Ross and his F.O have all the right intentions and want to be known as a successful organization.  I am also sure he needs this teaminvestment to bring in revenue.  Getting your investorsfanbase hyped and telling them what they want to hear gets tickets soldrevenue generated.  I was way more willing to buy a ticket to watch a home game at the beginning of the season and was planning on going to the Dallas game.  I abruptly cancelled those plans after the Bills game BC I personally dont want to spend that kind of money on this seasons team.

I was one of the few fuckers on here to support him during the slow start last year. Drafting a new QB would be a dumb ass move unless it was for backup depth. We need Oline in the first round not another fucking QB. Drafting a top QB would be insane and it kind of makes me think you are being sarcastic too. You would literally be repeating the same mistake of getting the franchise QB before the line was ready. Then he would have developmental issues because he cant stay upright.

5858572,0,t1_cxnjpn7,Here we go. The first big tell is his improvement on the deep ball. You cant throw a good deep ball unless you get back and are able to get into a good plant.The second tell is how consistent his plant is. How many times have you seen him throw off of his back foot? A third tell is how consistent his timing is on drops. The one thing that Lazor did right is get Tannehill to consistently back for one read passes in  step drops. A fourth tell is the accuracy on throws. Hes a pretty accurate QB. Despite the sack issues he consistently steps into his throws. Sure sometimes he throws the ball behind his receiver but every QB throws a bad ball. This doesnt happen often with RT and if tells me that hes setting his feet quickly and correctly when it comes to these timing throws.Honestly this is something Ive been paying attention to ever since RT said that this was his focus going into the offseason. ,miamidolphins,cxnl601,1,t5_2s20n

5952063,0,t3_3wxqmu,Penalties killed us. Joness facemask negated a rd and Long but that drive led to points because of it. Landrys Unsportsmanlike conduct made it difficult to make a comeback at that point. Grimes PI gave the giants breathing room and a st down. Yes the offense had some chances but they got  points that should be enough to win a game against the giants. Defense also didnt have a sack which Im disappointed about.In the end though we lost because of our recklessness and penalties. Its not any SINGLE players fault. Tannehill had that nice throw to Stills for the TD which I loved to see. Miller had  carries I guarantee the th carry wouldve been a TD just because we win whenever he gets  carries or more and  TDs so he played well.Landry had a big game but no TDs. Still though he fought hard.Ajayi played ok. He picked up a first on a rd down that saved a drive that led to points.OLine protected well. Not amazingly but they did a good enough job for Tannehill to step up and make the throws he needed to make early on.Defense let up some big plays most of which came after those crucial penalties.EDIT Tannehill audibles have almost always been successful.

He has fared well in our West Coast style offense but what if that changes when we have new OCs and a new HC. Miller isnt if the Adrian Peterson skillset but hes above average.  But is that worth the cost?  We drafted Ajayi. Who seems more of a power back and if everyone has been paying attention Ajayi had been getting somewhat of a try out over the past few games.   Hes gotten carries at important parts of a game and goalline carries. I personally am not willing to bet the house on Ajayi long term due to medical concerns but Im also not a Dolphins Doctor.

7139067,0,t3_4dc5ds,For reference Over the Cap has already calculated the  rookie wage scale based on the  salary cap. The cap hit for each of our current draft selections is as follows. These numbers have not yet been officially confirmed the NFL so far as I am aware however theyre calculated using a static formula based on the salary cap so I see no reason why they would be inaccurate.Round | Cap Hit|First | Second | Third | Fourth | Fifth | Sixth | Seventh | Another thing to keep in mind that if we continue to add competition at the guard position in the draft we should its unlikely that we also keep everyone currently on the roster.Right now were looking at a depth chart something like thisPos | First String | Second String | Third String | Fourth String||||LT | Albert | Young | PainterLG | Bushrod | Thomas | TurnerC | Pouncey | McClendonRG | Urbik | Douglas | SteenRT | James | JohnThats before we draft anyone and I wouldnt be surprised if we double up on the offensive line later in the draft. Theres no way that we carry  guys onto the active man roster.The Dolphins carried nine offensive lineman onto our final man roster last season. Expect the same this year. Guys I expect to be locks for those nine spots so far? Albert Pouncey James Bushrod Urbik and probably McClendon. Whether they crack the starting lineup or not I expect Bushrod and Urbik will remain because of the flexibility they provide as depth Bushrod at TG and Urbik at GC. I expect well keep McClendon for the same reason. That leaves three more spots unspoken for. How that shakes out probably depends on whether Bushrod cracks the starting lineup if he does well carry either Young or John as a backup tackle and who we draft. The depth chart at guard is looking awfully crowded and I have to imagine that unless Thomas steps it up bigtime hes going to be easy to cut to save nearly .MM against the cap.,miamidolphins,d1pmuti,11,t5_2s20n

Leadership talent. With the loss of Grimes and Oliver we defiantly need guys all around. But at our pick  you lose  of talent that will make an immediate impact as far as we know. Yet at that pick there is a player that can make an immediate impact on the other side of the ball. Elliot. With the loss of Miller who i think was worth the money is Ajayi a  down back? Maybe. Probably not. But he is no Elliot.  Elliot is being compared to Emmit Smith in size and lateral quickness which is EXTREMELY important in todays game. Hes also faster and a great pass blocker. Also with our passing scheme he is the perfect running back to constantly have the defense on their toes. After we draft him than we fix our defense!!!!!! This years class is thick with talent !P.S. If you dont think we need a running back youre working for the NY Jets. Please spare me the time to tell me we can get a running back later. I like Henry and Drake both from Alabama. And even though i LOVE Henry i think Elliot will be better. P.S. For anyone who disagrees i respect it.

If he beats someone out there then he stays. But hes not entitled to more game time he certainly hasnt earned it. As far as rushing goes. Hes . YPC average more than Williams.  Thats not a lot better especially when you consider hes significantly not a better receiver blocker or special teams player FYI Williams plays ST even when hes not returning....

I personally believe that the probability that anthropomorphic climate change is currently happening is very high.The IPO report regarding climate change is a probability prediction.  The probability  that climate will heat up  degrees C in the next  years is plus .A probability prediction is not a fact.  People who do not believe in climatechange are probably wrong.Yet look at they what they get called.  climatechange deniers.  They are not probably wrong they are deniers unbelievers they lack faith in the trueholy words of the liberal cultural zeitgeist.  People who do believe in climatechange also believe all sorts of other things that are mostly contradicted by most of the evidence.  For example a lot of them are GM food hysterics.For the vast majority of people belief in climate change is a faith based political belief. ,miamidolphins,dab8948,0,t5_2s20n

You could have star qbs like Brady and Rodgers who might only play each other once in their careers or just not play each other at all if one switches teams.

And the moment he cried to grandma  he picked his shit up. Good for him but he was being an asshole with us.As for Sean Smith holy shit was he frustrating to watch here. He could not catch an INT for gods sake. Look at his stats While he was a good CB to watch on coverage the fact that he couldnt catch a ball that would land on his hands.

They do have a significant home advantage and we know what happened  years ago when they dominated us in MNF. Bucs are an average  team. Away at Falcons is going to be tough but versus the Panthers at their current state is a winnable game.AFCS may be Texans since I still think the Tits will get the division. It would be a nice revenge game to have here. AFCN will likely be Steelers.

After he was out the defense went from bad but opportunistic to just historically bad. For most of the season we were very good at limiting big plays and I think that was a lot of IAQs play.

Cunningham and others have really poor tackling in college. In the NFL that will make them even worse. We need instantready players. The LB from UF caught my eye as well. If we can move up without paying too hefty a price for Foster Id be down. IMO the strategy should be to make a list of needs and take BPA in those positions when it comes our turn.

If not hell be very expensive which I am ok withZachary Brown good option. Was great last year in a  system. He doesnt like the Fins much and really hates Kiko. Called him soft on twitter last weekend. Our fans shit all over him On twitter for it. He may not be interested in coming. Perry Riley played pretty well for OAK but was unemployed as recently as  months ago. Kevin Minter Im not too familiar with him but. seems like a decent option. Only  years old too. Coming from a  so will have to adjust a bit. Gerald Hodges again not too familiar. Looks like he has a good year but some of that may be attributed to how bad SFs D is.
