Im not Japanese but I dont think the blue guy finished saying i surrender before Kurapika punched him...I checked the manga its the same way.it says I los.....  Im not going to tell you to keep watchingnot to keep watching but Im going to tell you that Hunter x Hunter is amazing.. Ive watchedread Naruto Bleach One Piece Fairy Tail Some other mangasanimes and I disliked anime. Then someone begged me to watch HxH and I really love it. For me this animemanga is number one.

194937,0,t3_1wc4e3,Episode   Gon vs Hisoka. The fight was animated so gorgeously. Really showed the gap between the two.Episode  Assualt x And x Impact  Ten Dons assassinated. Zeno amp Silva vs Chrollo. The amount of strategy and experience of Zeno shined in this episode. Episode  Light x And x Dark No explanation necessary.Episode  Check x And x Mate  The introduction to Komugi. I knew this character was special when she first opened her eyes and the king stated that the atmosphere has changed. Also near the end when she was the first one to make Meruem become frustrated.Episode  Charge x And x Invade  This episode marked start of a new arc in a way for me. Finally going to show us what these humans can do against the chimera ants to stop them from taking over the world. The epic entrance by Netero. Development of his character and gave of glimpse of how he became one of the top nen users in the world. These were some tough choices for me.

196200,0,t1_cf0msga,Umm no. Kurapika only had one power specifically for the troupe and its not even that good for instance if they simply just avoid getting caught in chain jail its completely useless but Kurapika is such a good nen user not even the leader can dodge it. He also was strong enough to tank Uvos strongest big bang impact with just a broken arm which he instantly healed with no problem. He was also ridiculously faster than Uvo probably about feitan level spee and just plain better than him. Youpi is a royal guard his power is on an entirely different level from both of them. His regular hits would be enough to either one shot or seriously injure them both meaning they are stronger than bbi. Manga spoilera Not too mention his rage blasts would completely fuck them up. Uvo would get slaughtered if they fought.,HunterXHunter,cf0sejr,4,t5_2spu5

531333,0,t3_2075fg,Mild spoilers for those who havent seenread Bleach yet.In Bleach Kiras ability to double the weight of anything that he can strike with Wabisuke. It has got downfalls He has to hit people close in with a weirdly shaped weapon if used improperly it could easily damage himself and in Bleach never was a way to reverse the weight shown to my knowledge. Those aspects would enhance its powers. I cant think of what nen category it would be under because I just woke up.SuiFengs ability to kill people with two touches also has drawbacks but might be a bit overpowered. Id think that it would need greater restriction to be plausible for HXH.The general Quincy ability to absorb and use energy from around the area and manipulate it into use for themselves. In Bleach it is Reiatsu so in HXH I guess it would be Nen The number of opponents or strength of their opponents would limit their own strength. I guess this is kinda up in the air though since the ability would essentially render their opponents useless. My guess is that they could only take what they could visibly see.,HunterXHunter,cg0o45o,2,t5_2spu5

Not because they can get him to write no one can do that... But because by giving the series such respect I believe they have convinced togashi the series is still worth continuing.

1297566,0,t3_28y3wa,No I wouldnt be sad even if it was his maximum but it wasnt!All it says is that he gained the strength he gained strength equal to what would take  no ! years of training. It doesnt actually say this IS Gon exactly in  years. So Gon could have more strength than that when he becomes  and who is to say that Gon doesnt peak when he is  years old. Look at Netero he was  or something when he started getting really strong.Above I was talking about strength alone.This transformation didnt give him extra memories which means he is still the  year old Gon mentally. Meaning he doesnt have the experience a  year old Gon would. From experience comes mental fortitude Gon would have been in better control of his emotions. A  year old Gon would never have lost his arm. So tactically emotionally and maybe pure strength wise Gon would be stronger if he aged naturally.The above wasnt even talking about his nen this is where a naturally aged Gon would be immensily superior. Gon only has  arguably complete Nen ability which is rock paper rock lol. Who knows what abilities a  year old Gon would have and rock paper rock could be more versatile as in he can use it while running or something along those lines. I imagin rock paper rock will probably be his bread and butter move but he will certainly have more incredible strong abilities. I mean look at Killua he has  or so abilities all ready and he is .TLDR When Gon transformed he only got strongerfaster physically. Naturally aged Gon would have better Nen abilities mental fortitude and technique.Mods message Froggenisgod he cant post anymore and doesnt know why!,HunterXHunter,ciflcyp,13,t5_2spu5

I also LOVE how the power levels in HxH havent moved much Gons gotten stronger but all of the tough Hunters are all around the same level from what we know. Its awesome how Togashi capped off the power in the middle of the manga and now the biggest threat is nature. They have to truly survive now instead of having to push their limits in battles.

Only thing I dont like about HxH is how elite nen users are even if youre a mediocre nen user no regular person really stands a chance against even if they use a simple Ko attack its a pretty Darwinist world but it makes perfect sense for it to be that way.,HunterXHunter,cjdsju5,7,t5_2spu5

1757622,0,t3_2ejk50,The requests Nanikas made to Killua have always been after minor wishes Milluki asking for a computer and Killua asking Nanika to heal.  Nanika however asked for fingernails after Killua made a request explicitly containing the intention to kill his own mother.The difficulty of the requests is determined by the nature of the previously made wish and anyone can make a wish when Nanika is called not just the one who fulfilled the requests.So when was he able to have permanently called?  Immediately after getting off the mountain Alluka began making requests again Killua had no way of preventing Tsubone from being asked nor any way of preventing her from showing up in the first place.Once the first request was fulfilled Killuas next chance to call Nanika wasnt until Tsubone showed herself again in the encounter with Illumi.  Alluka made requests again and Killua could call Nanika asking to heal Tsubones hand.  After healing Nanika fell asleep after making a request to Killua.  Thats how the episode left off.So... unless you want spoilers is your question why did Killua let Alluka sleep?  I guess the answer to that is Killua loves Alluka and wanted her to rest. ,HunterXHunter,ck0pela,1,t5_2spu5

But at the same time many shoonen feel similar. Naruto for example has the basic concept. Need to pass to become a ninja. there is a arc similar to the HxH tests. There are superpowers. Sasuke is the kinda badish dude with cooler powers is smarter and better looking than the MC. They adventure the world helping people changing the view of bad people. etc. Its finished but it has  chapters or  episodes in the original and  so far in shippuuden.Nurarihyon No Mago. Felt similar yet it is quite different  Its about a yokai lord. They have powers which are limited to one thing like Gons paper rock scissors attack or Kills electricity. Its fun and only had  seasons and o thing  movies which are great especially the one about the second. the manga finished so even if you finish the anime you can finish it by reading the manga.

HxH isnt the most adult Anime out there but it certainly is adult unless your friend means something else by adult e.g. wants to see bulging penis I think theyre totally wrong about HxH and should give it another go.  ,HunterXHunter,cmn5w5v,20,t5_2spu5

I never thought if AtLA was an anime or not I knew it was an American show when i first saw it. Animation style might be similar to anime and there are a lot of asian themes and references but the way they animate the facial expressions speech and the general color palette is definitely American. This is what you can see by just watching it and comparing it to various anime.In Japanese the term anime actually refers to any form of animation. But outside of Japan its used exclusively to refer Japanese animation. The style or themes has nothing to do with it. Somebody in America can animate a show with perfect anime style and it still wouldt be an anime. Its pretty much is it from Japan or not? at this point.And Im not even going into LoK the facial detail and the body proportions are much more realistic than your average anime it doesnt even resemble that style as AtLA did.I also want to point out I fucking love both AtLA and LoK.

Remember Bisky tried to teach him something not just do all the work for him. Anyway you talking as if their plan didnt work. Which isnt true. gtYou needed to know nen to be considered a real pro hunter. Netero doesnt count. We never knew where he stood on the ladder. Thats the problem. We never know the gap between them and the top hunters. Killua and Gon have to be super fighters. Thats they type of hunter they are.Dont you see that all these things are no drawbacks?

The Bomber tried and there mightve been others like him who were close to victory. But it was Gon who managed to win because he wasnt working alone. He got help from some cool hunters like Hisoka who helped him to beat Razor. Do you think there are many hunters who can compete with Razor? Weve seen several top hunters already an none of them was interested in the game itself because there too busy in the real world.gtHow do you make money in the GI? By being hired to play the game by bringing items to the real world the cards cannot work unless you win the game but there are jewels etc. it was all mentioned in the anime,HunterXHunter,cp8iakr,1,t5_2spu5

Even if the conjured object is then manipulated we see that most manipulators can manipulate many objects at the same time. Why would there be a limit of chains you can place on the targets heart.

3441515,0,t1_cpkijp7,What Im saying is his main nen type could become emission or transmutation and he could keep part of jajanken if it did. Lets say Gon now becomes an emitter. With emission as the center manipulation and enhancement are now the two closest nen types to his new type. While relearning nen he decides to make jajanken his hatsu again and keeps paper as the emitted energy ball and rock as the enhanced megaton punch. Since transmutation is a much weaker type for him now he decides to make scissors a brand new manipulationbased mode. I have no clue what scissors would be like as manipulation but it would be kinda cool to see what form it would take. So we would get to see him make a brand new mode for Jajanken while still keeping two the old modes. Or the same thing if he was now a transmuter but with paper being some new conjuration ability since he would be bad at emission now.I do agree with you though Id love to see Gon make a new nonJajanken hatsu in a different type.,HunterXHunter,cpkk4b6,1,t5_2spu5

4160125,0,t1_cru07tq,Oh wow I never though about that. Kalluto was especially intrigued with his fight against Zazan too and he has Kikyos black hair plus Kikyo does come from Meteor City which is Feitans home as well. Maybe he is Kikyos child before she married Silva and thus a half brother to all the known Zoldyck children. Like uAaoroniero also mentioned Feitan looks very Hiei like which is what Killua was kind of supposed to represent in the four main characters of HxH in comparison to the four main characters of YYH so there is that similarity as well. This would be a very interesting development if it turns out to be true.Edit Feitan is also one of the more cruel Phantom Troupe members which seems in line with Kikyos nature seeing as how she was willing to let Milluki attempt to torture Killua into submission to not leave the Zoldyck family again. Also its quite apparent that Milluki Illumi and possibly Kalluto going off how he played around with that one Chimera Ant before killing it inherited their taste for cruelty from Kikyos side so perhaps the same could be said for Feitan.,HunterXHunter,crugqe7,2,t5_2spu5

4543777,0,t3_3danb2,That was a really nice read. Thanks for taking your time to share it with us.I think your theory is not really a theory. To me it sounds that this is how Togashi actually devised this story about Netero. Although he might not have directly been inspired from the  stages to higher conciousness of metaphysics. Im not familiar with the subject so correct me if Im wrong but I think it would have been possible that he was inspired from Budhism or Hinduism. Either way its crazy how well the themes in the manga about Netero actually match with the  stages to higher consciousness.Looking forward to the next part.

Its hard to get into the voices because you get used to the  ones but its worth it because they go into more detail in the story and reveal things from the manga that  doesnt.

Theres no way shell catch shit in  years.Even Meruem prerose wouldnt be able to get the ball until he learns Neteros rhythm and start anticipating the attacks.So netero wouldve smacked Killua before he even activated his ability the same way he did Pitou or hell use zero hand directly on him.Normal Gon gets stomped...Gonsan will struggle a little but something tells me he can stop Kannons hands. He seemed very fast as he dodged Pitous attack with extreme ease. Or maybe his full charged Jajanken could pierce though Kannons defence and disable the ability entirely?Of course if Netero is just playing around like he was doing in the hunter exam then Killua probably gets the ball and Gon....

Killua is probably stronger and deadlier than Gon at this point.  God Speed brought Killua into a new tier imo whereas Gon is still figuring out the strengthsweaknesses of Jajanken.  Gon will catch upsurpass Killua once he gets his full rockpaperscissors down perfectly or if Gon gets a new ability  entirely.  And PLEASE LET THAT BE THE CASE Im sick of the same slow powerup move always being the center of Gons attacks...every fight is first comes rock repeated over and over nowAs for Kurapika can he use his specialist ability to unlock all the categories of Nen on ANYONE or just vs Phantom Troupe members?  So...if he fought Pariston or something he could still use Emperor Time to be a master enhancerconjurermanipulatortransmuter?  If he can still use all nen categories vs anyone then I would say hes up there with Killua or above once he gets angry.

You can be the strongest fighter in the world in the HXH universe yet can lose to the weakest if you have no resolve.,HunterXHunter,cx5fl3s,1,t5_2spu5
5732666,0,t3_3tnn8e,I think illumi might cause or help bring about allukas death.   Killy needs to drop the baggage and be Gons BFF once again. Plus I want to see Killua surprise Illumi with his strength and determination.   Killua doesnt have to kill Illumi  but he does have to defeat him in some way.  I also think that in the end  Killua will break his family tradition of assassination once he becomes the head of the family. ,HunterXHunter,cx7oyti,5,t5_2spu5

Friendship is the main theme pretty much and the lengths characters will go to for it.There is fighting very very stylish swordfighting but its not really the point of the show. Beautiful animation and design complex characters and dynamics and just a great trippy ride allaround.

It depends ONLY on if his lightningfast attacks could be read and reacted to by Gon.  Gon was a speed monster casually outclassing Pitou  another legendary speed monster  so its possible he could react even to Killuas God speed.   The way Gon rated top Pitou though... He might be sensing his enemies through their aura in which case  he might be able to detect killy Killua Chrollo  Netero or knov are maybe the only man users who could kill adult Gon  despite being outclassed in every aspect.  Their only hope would be their unique nen abilities ,HunterXHunter,cxglxoi,0,t5_2spu5

In the world of hxh it seems there are areas where its not as developed so artisans and trade can flourish there. Artisans and specific types of jobs at the top of their craft are nen users. For example Bens knife the serial killer and the many artifacts shown in the auction arc. In heavens arena nen is introduced we meet gons and killuas first master. And be comes from a school of martial arts.  How big it is we dont know but we should assume there are hundreds of ppl that know how to use the basics of nen from martial arts schools.

Morel would of been the most useful as if they had to deal with Ikalgo first he could of just created a smoke screen and some smoke clones so even Flutter would be confused about giving out their locations. They could eventually get close to him and kill him.

What they are good at is thinking ahead of their targets redirecting attention and pulling tricks or illusions. This is just the result of lots and lots of practice. I think Hisoka wants to keep fighting the strongest opponents because weak opponents present no challenge and no opportunity for growth.

Like Goreinu emits his gorillas but it isnt Transmutation because he isnt copying the properties of gorillas like their enhanced eyesight or climbing or whatever he just makes them look like gorillas. And they arent Conjured because again they arent real gorillas.,HunterXHunter,czrc3lh,3,t5_2spu5

While not prominent in the next review Leorio will get his time during the Election arc. Hes actually a tough character to right about because I feel most of his traits and progression as a character are much more subdued that say Gon or Meruem.

You can battle others using only cards I wouldnt include Nen in this that you find by winning mini games or by stealing from others.Make it so you can create factions or join one. The first faction that gets all the cards wins and receives a reward. for example skins access to new cards or other gameplay related rewards.Or you can make it like a battle arena with a match of  hours but that may feel rushed. I hope your game will become popular enough. The game will feel lame if no one comes. Good luck and keep us updated!,HunterXHunter,d18wluc,1,t5_2spu5

Also I think that saying afterimage or not is another point for another discussion the time she saw Netero all of her  senses were heightened to the limits while its safe to assume that she was kinda of impaired against Gon which is actually a great point for Gon for being the first person to even make her feel fear but not just because of the monster in front of her but the thought of what it could do to the King. Ofc with that state of mind she wouldnt be able to have a reaction to see that. Still being able to see the afterimage of Netero motions is because of the extreme fluidty that they display or even might be an effect of the nen. Truth is she could never touch Netero so its not safe to assume that Gon is faster than Netero just because he was faster than Pitou.,HunterXHunter,d1jjy9w,1,t5_2spu5

7433605,0,t3_4h2a1w,I was in a similar position as you about  a year or  ago. HXH was really the first anime I had watched recommended by a friend and I really liked it. Ive since watched  other animes Kaiji Jojos Bizarre Adventure and Parasyte.     I thought Kaiji was great and has a lot of suspense and was interesting. Not really crazy fighting but more of a show about a gambling man down on his luck and the misfortunes that come his way. Lots of cool moments of mental trickery and techniques.Jojo has become pretty much my favorite out of what Ive watched. Though I like to just say HXH is my favorite anime and Jojo is my favorite manga. That way theyre both included Its crazy not as serious as HXH but still has interesting and fun battles and characters. The seasons are separated into parts that introduce you to new memorable characters and new dangers. It can get pretty bizarre heh but treats itself seriously. So its not some dumb wacky lol XD anime like the name may suggest.Parasyte I really liked at first but as the season progressed the main character started annoying me. His actions and whatnot. Look into it if you like a more serious tone with aliens and almost horror like elements not scary just gory.So yeah. I probably didnt need to type this much but I sort of got caught up in what I was trying to say. Anyway everyone has different tastes but as someone who has a similar story to yours I thought Id recommend some shows.

Chrollo couldnt use nen when he was bound by the chain cuz it was part of Kurapikas conditions but this was simply a nen suspension period. And Alluka reverted Gon back to normal but perhaps did not control for when so he might have been reverted back to himself before he learned nen does this mean hes younger now lol.

7558303,0,t1_d30xbip,gt One thing I really like about the second half of the Chimera Ant arc is how Gon and Netero take the roles of the villain while being portrayed as heroes. I dont think thats completely accurate.Both sides are heroes or villains depending on which side of the fence you were born on.From humanitys perspective the ants are monsters. But humans are really no better because we kill and eat billions of animals a year. To the ants humans are just food animals. Its not a moral quandary to them they are as entitled to eat humans as humans are entitled to eat any other animal. We are different species.Its from there that the morality gets more complicated. Some of the ants morality does evolve over time particularly Meruem and the royal guard but it doesnt erase the atrocities they committed so far and they dont appear to want to live as mere peers to humans but still seem to want to rule over them.So from the human perspective its about self defense since the ants attacked first and letting them continue to grow as a species could eventually spell doom for the entire human race. And humanity can think of them as just another species of animal to this end and not lose sleep over wiping them out.At the close of the arc the survivors clearly acknowledge that being different species doesnt really matter what matters is sentience and compassion but it took a lot of bloodshed to get there.,HunterXHunter,d31ccf7,6,t5_2spu5

7629589,0,t1_d39dn9w,I mean... when you put it like that its hard not to appreciate some things that the Chimera Ant arc does well as fsr as story telling but I still believe he is going to introduce characters somewhat close to Meruems power. And even by doing so it wont harm the series because Togashi will always introduce the psychology of battle in a way only he can. The power scaling may feel off for me forever but I also think Togashi introduced Meruem as a foreshadowing of the potential powers of not only the DC calamities but of incredibly polished Human nen users. Honestly though its too early for me and everyone else making assumptions of what certain people can do to Meruem without even seeing their development in the series yet.

Youre right he has more tricks up his sleeve but that doesnt entail a completely new different hatsu.

7888245,0,t3_4ncg9p, This application of his Bungee Gum has been discussed to ad infinitum on this subreddit so I was not that surprised when he finally did it. I would guess it was because Hisoka realized he had no chance of beating Chrollo in this situation and just kept his tricks to himself. Now Hisoka is a Bungee Gum pirate coming for the booty. Hisoka probably was able to deduce they were here. Machi wouldnt be the only Spider in the area so he just hunted them down. I dont think we required panels to show him walking through the halls trying to find them. Machi is a pretty calm person but she shouldnt have just stood there chatting up with someone who on multiple occasions threatened to kill her boss betrayed her multiple times and then literally come back to life. Why didnt she just slice his throat then and there? It doesnt take much forward thinking that letting him come to life is bad news for Chrollo and the Spiders yet she let it happen and had small idle chat with him only to surprise surprise immediately get betrayed again. Machi and Hisoka must have some sort of strange past together. ,HunterXHunter,d42pmrv,3,t5_2spu5

Where he must figure out what Chrollos plan is. They both used the tools they have in their arsenal. You cant blame Chrollo for using his Skill Hunter.I ask you this though. And please answer. If you think that was as one sided as it could have gotten What would happen if Chrollo didnt tell Hisoka about all of the abilities used? Hisoka will now even have to figure out what the ability does. How is Hisoka suppose to prepare to the Bookmark? The fight lasted longer because Chrollo wanted too. He wanted Hisoka to be humiliated and feel total defeat. I think its fanboyish for you to say Hisoka wouldve won in the same setting without bearing in mind how impossibly difficult a prepared Chrollo is as an opponent because of how unpredictable his Skill hunter is as an ability. We have an idea what Hisoka will do when he he fights without prep because we know of his Bungee Gum and Texture Surprise.

7985885,0,t3_4ojkvq,Their relationship reminds me of Hisoka and Illumis I think he just likes frank people. There doesnt seem to be a lot of romantic feelings. Theyre just cool with each other and whenever theyre alone together Hisoka comes off as more... relaxed? If that makes sense? Since he asks her to fix him up occasionally hes forced to show her a more vulnerable side of himself which Machi appreciates because this tells her that Hisoka will not bite the hand that feeds him. His battlecrazed persona takes the backseat because I think that Hisoka probably enjoys having a normal conversation every once in a while. It just so happens that hes decided that he likes pushing buttons and fighting more.,HunterXHunter,d4dotln,5,t5_2spu5

Second of all how do you know that Kalluto is wearing make up lol? Hisoka wears high heels during both Heaven Arena and Election Arc even his earrings are feminine. His clothes are not clown clothes it was never stated that he wears clown clothes hes a magician clowns wear different types of clothes his clothes are not normal either but very feminine for a dude especially during Election Arc. Also I think you tried to ignore this statement made by NatexNate right here Knov specifically says that every Chimera Ant has the ability to reproduce by mating with FEMALES of other species.

8847238,0,t3_51dj9r,The personality tests said I would be a conjurer and I am pretty happy with that. I would conjure a pair of daggers which I could use for both up close fights and as a throwing weapon. The major downside of throwing weapons in games shows is losing the weapon once you throw it but as shown with the vacuum in the fight vs spider dude you can just desummon and resummon them as needed. Also conjurers can add a lot of special abilities to equipment as long as they have some well thought out conditions.I have thought this out more than I would like to admit but I came up with a pretty good strategy. The daggers would have a corrosive effect when they touch someone but could be negated through use of nen. I would also conjure a mass effect style full armor suit with the effect of absorbing nen attacks at the cost of draining my own. With this combination I would train my own aura capacity as high as possible and be able to consistently win fights through nen attrition. of course these effects would require adequate conditions to work.Finally conjurers are next to transmuters so you could use those rather efficiently as well.,HunterXHunter,d7bb97o,1,t5_2spu5

9096953,0,t1_d839gum,gt I personally think to sumamarize an event that happened in minutes like the invasion you need that narration to create that suspense that every single action mattered whether it was planned or even by chance.I just finished the show recently and I absolutely loved it. I like long buildups I like how HxH breaks the mold time and time again and I liked most of the CA arc. But the palace invasion was so agonizingly slow I was considering watching then at . speed just to get it over with. In some cases the narration was necessary to explain attacks but in no way should the narrator have told us how the characters felt or stating the obvious. It was extremely jarring to have the narrator state things like Pitou felt relief or Gon was raring to fight. There was even one scene at the beginning where Killua takes out two enemies for Ikalga which was shown twice one time with narration and one time without it it flowed a lot better without having the narration breaking up the tension. ,HunterXHunter,d85b2jv,3,t5_2spu5

9214201,0,t1_d8ix0qs,gt Gon punching the gorilla all the way to the NGL is the most powerful FEAT of raw physical STRENGTH that we see in the entire seriesSo does that make Gon the most powerful character in the series? What exactly is your point here? Phinks is much more impressive than Gon for crying out loud. In order for Gon to punch Hisoka like that Hisoka would literally have to stand there and let him charge his attack and punch him. What Im saying is without Gons enhancer attack Hisoka is stronger all around and yes even physically in a fight. Also you must not know what strawmanning is. You seem to be misconstruing what I am saying. gt Are we even watching the same series? Did you miss the part where the narrator said she came back stronger than she was when she was alive or what?Her NEN ABILITY came back stronger not her lol. Also my memory is fuzzy how do you know Killua is faster than Zombie Pitou? If memory serves correct Gon took care of dead Pitou after he lost his arm. gt You apparently must have never actually seen this series because the narrator explicitly says that Terpsichora brought Pitou back to life stronger than ever. See above comment. gt It doesnt matter if Pitou is mindless Terpsichora is what was controlling her body and making her stronger. Pitou didnt even had a fcking head so I dont know what shed have to even be mindful about. Terpsichora was the one that animated Pitous corpse so of course its able to think about how it attacks I dont understand the point of this statement.Zombie Pitou wasnt stronger the Nen ability was. There is a difference. gt Hmm what kind of logical fallacy is this appeal to popularity? Oh what the people who ever tf that is just up and decided Killua didnt blitz Youpi or did your not really making a point here? Yeah try and troll harder next time.Nobody is denying that Killua was faster than Youpi for those  minutes. You realize Youpi was a Nen noob? Im not trying to downplay Killuas excellent potential and badass hatsu lets be real when he walked down to Youpi while activating Godspeed he was a total badass but you are neglecting other factors. gt No featsno proof Pouf could handle Killuas speed. Try againCool bro I guess top five nen users in the world and the ability to freakin copy Leorios hatsu doesnt count amirite? Also who exactly is it that I am dickriding here? As far as I can tell youre the one riding Killua. gt Well when everyone or really just you and that maniac guy just constantly ignores the facts and the feats in favor of baseless hype and opinions and biases that kinda seems like trolling to me idk.Saw other arguments like all over this entire post so idk what you are talking about.

9443553,0,t3_5a1q8e,Fun idea.Its hard to say who would win between Nobunaga and Bisuke. Im actually going to give it to Nobunaga. Neither of these characters have demonstrated what they would be capable of in a serious fight though. The reason I say Nobunaga is because Bisuke seems to be more of a personal trainer than a fighter. Even Bisukes hatsu seems to be developed for the sole purpose of training. Nobunaga would undoubtedly be more combat oriented in his abilities.I say Shoot wins. Shoot would know about Hakoware since they are partners and that is Knuckles ace in the hole. If you know about it before hand it isnt that tough to deal with. Shoot also has a versatile ability.Hisoka wins. Kurapica cant use his strongest techniques against Hisoka. Kurapicas best bet would be to use his scarlet eyes and gain  control over all nen types. But that alone may not be enough since the bulk of Kurapicas hatsu is solely meant for fighting spiders only. Zeno wins. Dont forget Feitan struggled against Zazan. Silva crushed Cheetu in one blow and most people are under the assumption that Zeno is stronger than Silva. Since both Zazan and Cheetu are captain class Chimera Ants it seems reasonable enough to assume that Zeno would have the edge.,HunterXHunter,d9d1cw7,1,t5_2spu5

9702399,0,t3_5dzktr,Gon and Killuas relationship is one of the best written relationships ive seen in manga period. Its probably the best relationship written ever after Guts and Griffith. The character development for Killua especially was phenomonal and some of the best written character development ive ever seen. Honestly the way i see it the entire first half of hxh wasnt even really about Gon but actually Killua and his development. Gons journey to find Ging was really just the backdrop to Killua and his relationship with Gon. Killuas character arc is basically complete now. Gon still needs to grow and develop as a character and i dont think his arc will be over until the final confrontation with Gyro.As for Kite he actually had a huge impact on Gon hes basically the entire reason this series even exists. Kite was literally the first character ever shown in HxH and he was the one who revealed that Ging was still alive Mito lied and said Gons mom and dad were dead and told Gon about him and gave him his license which convinced Gon to set off to become a Hunter a Hunter Hunter to find him. Kite is quite literally the most important character to Gon besides Mito so it makes sense why he did what he did. In a way you could say Kite is like Gons stepfather or i guess mother now as he revealed that when he met Ging he seemed like a cool uncle or relative rather than a father. And Gons character arc isnt over yet because the series isnt over yet so thats why he still needs time to develop and grow as a character.,HunterXHunter,da911ek,9,t5_2spu5

The rest of the family doesnt give a shit and just defaults to referring to her as male. She COULD always just be trans as everyone theories but the fact that Killua even referred to her as a girl when she was like three or four years old makes me think that its unlikely.

I still find that very ambiguous though does that mean thats a Gon that has done absolutely nothing but train no sleeeping eating missions... or one that has kept up his normal level of training? This matters a lot because in the first case it should be impossible for Gon to reach that level of power precisely because it was achieved through an impossible amount of training. This does not mean Gon cannot get overall more powerful than Gonsan I think Netero in his prime could have defeated him possibly old Netero as well just that I think he will have to do so through technique not just raw strength.As for your first question whether Gon can surpass Gonsan... we dont know. Due to how Neferpitou and Killua explained the ability its difficult to say whether Gon stopped his transformation when he had reached a level of power with which he could defeat his opponent implying he could have gotten even stronger or Gonsan was the absolute peak of his power.,HunterXHunter,dauvri6,11,t5_2spu5

Ultimately I suspect Nanika will have to exit the picture somehow regardless of whether or not Alluka wants her to.

I dont study literature at least not to a very complex level or to the scale of a whole manga but it doesnt make me unable to judge a critic its good points its sophism and I can get an objective enough opinion even if with HH I havent read enough article to judge of the relative quality of the adaptation with the manga.,HunterXHunter,dbiwumk,1,t5_2spu5

10078260,0,t1_dbl6o1o,gt Just that to me I understood as if Zeno said that because Chrollo thought he didnt understood he wasnt seriously trying to kill them during that fight and thats why he said brat because Chrollo was underestimating his deduction skills. I think if thats the case and hurt his pride Zeno doesnt need to say that right after answering the question. Zeno is aware of Chrollos intention all along during the fight so He could say that in his monologue at the time but instead they just praise him.gt To me the  I dont mind if you would kill him together with me seems more like  dont be bothered by me just attack with all youve got.OK we agree to disagree on this. Edit But whats the difference? Does that mean Zeno says that Silva should atack them with the power strong enough to kill Chrollo but not enough to kill Zeno by adjusting it skillfully? Their mission is to kill Chrollo with certainty.gt I said relatively easily because none of them were injured by Chrollo except once when he stabbed Silva in the arm I think its partly because Chrollo just tried to catch him alive for stealing his hatsu with Fun Fun Cloth whose ability I believe is not tailored to deliver a damaging blow even though we dont know the full extent of its power.,HunterXHunter,dbl7v3f,2,t5_2spu5

10123169,0,t3_5kuyd7,Meruem is probably first followed by Gonsan. Then Pitou Pouf and Youpi. Actually though Pitous aura scared Netero and Zeno more than Meruems as it caused them to get ready to die whereas Meruems only led Netero to take a few steps back though it may have been because he had already seen just how powerful the ants were. After that the scariest aura shown so far was Neteros while he meditated to get closer to his former power. I think Illumi follows suit since his Ren could be felt from the foot of a mountain. Then probably Hisoka Razor and Uvogin. I am not listing their aura in terms of power just scariness though the two are connected.,HunterXHunter,dbr20ft,4,t5_2spu5

I dont believe the first exam was intentionally made to be like the DC maybe the author will model the DC after it but I wouldnt be surprised if the Hunter Exam were in general that harsh precisely because Netero expected someone at some point to lead an expedition to the DC and wanted to have only the best of the best.

10396748,0,t1_dcmierq,It seems I mightve been unclear but I agree that subjective Nen vows make the most sense for the same reason you stated. This actually creates less chances to use as a plot device in my opinion unless you consider that the main characters will have higher degrees of emotion. But functionally it doesnt seem to work this way it seems like we are told about the reason that makes the most sense but instead of a characters perception of a condition it is Togashis reasoning that controls its value for the reason that it would make for a less stable system than what we see. Good point about Gons irrationality coming into play. As for the other kinds of conditions it seems they would be much harder to weigh. Like if you can only use it on a certain number of people how that would be calculated I have no clue. Again users perception of difficulty makes the most sense realistically but it would be fluid and it depends a lot on the confidence of the users. Shoot for example would benefit more from conditions than someone like Morel. But it doesnt seem to work this way same as vows it seems more based on Togashi acting as a divinity giving value to things.,HunterXHunter,dcmjd9x,0,t5_2spu5

10435483,0,t3_5p0u4u,Its a possibility but I wouldnt get to excited. HxH  was a passion project and most of the staff was comprised of huge hunter x hunter fans. I wouldnt be surprised if they wanted to return for more. However hunter x hunter getting another anime would be kind of odd. Its notoriously popular in japan and Shueisha probably doesnt need another anime to advertise it. Despite this we still got the  anime for whatever reason so I couldnt really tell you. So to be honest whether or not we get another season of HxH greenlit in the first place is up in the air. If one does get greenlit though I wouldnt be surprised if we saw some returning staff.  ,HunterXHunter,dcqxjx9,1,t5_2spu5

10600019,0,t3_5rq74q,Well first it was only Machis hunch that Chrollo wanted to recruit Kurapika. And even if Chrollo was considering it he didnt know Kurapikas intentions of wanting to bring down the Troupe. Chrollo was probably thinking he was just a strong fighter that happened to best Uvo. But even if that was the case there was gonna be some animosity of bringing him in of course. Also I dont believe a person has to kill a member in secret if someone thinks their bad enough you can probably walk right up and challenge one of them. But and this is my own personal opinion it seems some members are off limits like Shizuku Pakuda Kortopi and maybe Shalnark. Shalnark already says people like Shizuku and Pakuda have rare powers the Troupe needs and has also said its the shields responsibility to protect members like that. Also the rest like Shalnark and Kortopi dont seem like fighters so thats why I think their off limits. I believe if you wanted to kill your way into the Troupe the only members available to fight are members whose purpose is to protect weaker members like Nobunaga Franklin Phinks Feitan and maybe Machi. So I believe those are the ones eligible to fight the actual stronger members. ,HunterXHunter,dd9b6zs,9,t5_2spu5
10619518,0,t3_5rz08q,gtDo you think the Troupe used Pakunodas ability every time they would have a new member when she was still alive?NoI dont think so its possible she did but I dont see Hisoka being allowed to be in the troupe if she scanned him. Although it is possible that she can only search memories and not motives.. but even so I would expect some incriminating experiences. Furthermore If she did read Hisoka that could mean the whole troupe knows a fair bit about his past  and that just sounds kind of wrong..gtdont deal physical damage but it would erase ones own memory if Pakunoda uses their own memory against themI wonder if they have a shared experience can Pakus memory of those events erase another persons memories of the same event?  Paku was an original member so shed have a lot of shared memories. Chances are though on various jobsor even developing her abillity she would have read several of the other members for various reasons.gt if the bullets were actual bullets the Troupe wouldnt have problem either dodging or blocking them.its possible they were just wary of an attack maybe they were considering Paku had an abillity none of them were aware of?gtWhen Pakunoda asked Gon and Killua what are you hiding do you think that question included everything about themselves?I think it depends on how deep Paku is trying to look. It would show  her what they were hiding in the momentbecause thats what she meant but if she had tried to look every possible secret could have been revealed  including Nanika. As it was Nanika wasnt anywhere close to being on Killuas mind so Im sure the troupe know nothing about it  its also possible that she was protected by Illumis needle blocking access to Zoldyck family secretsor at least things that he didnt want Killua to acknowledgeact on  like Nanika. And even if Paku had actually seen it she probably wouldnt have known what it meant and put aside that information in favor of the issues at hand.,HunterXHunter,ddbbn2o,5,t5_2spu5

10675459,0,t3_5sqj2c,Hello everyone Someone suggested posting my HxH collection on here since some people might be interested in what the merchandise looks like and where I bought it. I usually post pictures on my tumblr account.   Since Im able to post one picture I thought Id start out with my Hisoka figure collection. I do have other merchandise such as keychains TShirts bags and a towel with Hisoka on it.  The large figure on the left in the back is called Hisoka Hyskoa G.E.M. Figure that I bought from Japan Yahoo Auctions for about . The starting bid was for  but I kept placing a bid against another buyer until they finally stopped and I won it. Usually people sell it for about  to . The two large figures next it to it are called Ichiban Kuji Hunter x Hunter Prize B Hisoka Figure. I bought both off from Japan Yahoo Auctions for about  each.   The medium size figure on the tatami is called DXF Figure Hisoka vol. . I bought this in Akihabara at a store on the second floor of Radio Kaikan for about .   The figure next to it is called Hunter x Hunter Premium Bandai Limited Hisoka. I bought this for about  in Akihabara at a store on the fourth floor of Akiba Culture Zone.  The smaller figures I bought from Japan Yahoo Auction Radio Kaikan Nakano Broadway and Akiba Culture Zone for about  to .   Ive been collecting HxH merchandise for a little over  years now. I used to search for merchandise in Akihabara when I had free time but ever since my friend told me about Japan Yahoo Auctions I keep my eye out for good deals. Unfortunately a lot of the HxH merchandise costs a lot of money but you can find good deals if you search for the same figure at another store in Akihabara or online.   I have more merchandise that I would like to share if thats okay? ,HunterXHunter,ddh3cxq,7,t5_2spu5

And yes it is also is very convenient for the narrative.Though if you want to question the writing I would suggest to start with how exactly Hisoka is supposed to find out that Troup is planning to rob the ship?

10676441,0,t3_5sqxjc,Yeah it wouldve been a perfect opportunity to but I think Genthru didnt blow his face off for several reasons . He just got kicked in the face with a  Nen foot and just barely avoided a Jajaken to the face and was definitely shocked by the way things just went down . By that point in the fight Gons pride and his stubbornness made Genthru want to put him in his place at least before killing him so Genthru wanted to use that moment to outwit him and deal more damage thus crushing his throatI just finished watching that fight about an hour ago its a good one Edit also I dont think Killua stood a chance. He wouldnt have been much better off than Gon. Although at this point Killua does have the slight advantage over Gon in regards to physical strength Goreinu mentioned by the closing episodes of the GI Arc that Genthru was much stronger than both of the boys so they must have formed a great plan ,HunterXHunter,ddh709a,3,t5_2spu5

It would indeed be simply a way to make it all better.But Nanika is confirmed to be a foreshadowing for what awaits us in the next arc Nanika  Ai confirmed which means that Togashi not only introduced a plot device to fix things with he introduced a plot element to shed light on future developments. This is why its such a great addition to the plot.Togashi could have gone the generic shonen formula of Hey weve conveniently discovered new rumors of something that could grant any wish lets embark on this very tough adventure to earn it and undo all the damage of the previous arc and have Gon stay in a coma for a whole arc or two but he didnt.

In Kurapikas case his Specialized Nen grants him  efficiency when using the power of any ability he has learned so far whereas a usual nonspecialized Kurapika normal eyes suffers from lowered efficiency when using anything but Conjuration.Efficiency does not equal proficiency it only means that you can draw out the most out of said proficiency.A good example would be language efficiency is your ability to use all the vocabularies and grammar rules youve learned eloquently but you can still use only the words in your lexicon and not beyond.

10780615,0,t3_5u7ott,Its kind of funny you say that because people usually question Killua and whether he has a crush on Gon but I could see how it would go the other way around at the start of the series.I personally think Gon wont develop romantic sensibilities until he gets somewhat older but when he does I would guess he would approach romance in the way he does everything else which is to say it wont matter to him what someones gender is as long as he finds them interesting. Killua I suspect might be gay considering his reactions to stuff like Bisky and Aiai City later in the series and because he acts in certain ways around Gon and expresses certain things about him which youll see as time goes on. Togashi is known for liking to include LGBT characters so it would be well within the realm of possibility.

10859830,0,t3_5v8hx3,I look at it like this. The HxH world seems vast as big as ours well bigger concerning the DC. Only the hunter association is trying to keep nen secret but I think its natural that a place would develop for nen users despite that attempt to keep it secret.  Not as culturally prominent as say a brothel in every town of a country or alcoholic beverages being in every culture in the world but in a world with nen or magic it makes sense that theres at least one place in the world that naturally and I mean natural as a natural human settlement came to be. Cities near the oceans have ports cities in the mountains have igloos and cities with lots of nen users have a big tower for them to fight in.,HunterXHunter,de045b6,5,t5_2spu5

10889267,0,t1_de34qyn,Well many persons in HxH just dont fight with weapons and Considering that Mike had fought against people with weapons he must have a high resilence and durability.gt If you pay enough theres not really a reason to betray.If somebody want you dead it can contract somebody that act as a double agent or pay more than you there is always a chance of betraying if money is involved. And considering that they are other manipulators around that servant can be controlled.gt I dont see how you can have a complex conversation in a morse code of barks. Ok now Im imagining it and I laughed a lot. Still we had seen things more weirder than a complex dialogue of barks. gtWhat I meant by this was not to waste Shu on dogs. Shu I presume needs a lot more aura than needlemen. The aura used on Shu could be better spent on himself.In the original post it could be control of the own dogs aura or using shu and yes it would  use more aura that a single needlemen but is one of better quality. and fighting against more opponents is harder specially in a dog of Mikes caliber or stronger.,HunterXHunter,de35faf,1,t5_2spu5
10902745,0,t1_de4h6nh,gt Dogs in dishonored and dogs in Hunter x Hunter I would imagine are fairly similar owing to the fact that they are both dogs.In two completely different fictional non realistic universes. There is no comparison. It is apples and oranges. For one you have to consider the gameplay balancing the difficulty played on the magical abilities involved and the supernatural weapons. Thats all just for Dishonored. Now you have to consider the completely different set of rules that fundamentally drive HxH the completely different system of abilities and the entirely fictional scaling of psychical attributes of all animals and living things in HxH. It is ridiculous to think that you can judge one aspect of one by the other. There is almost nothing in common between Dishonored and HxH and if there was that still wouldnt be grounds for basing any assumptions on anecdotal evidence from one unrelated universe to create mere speculations with no other evidence to support a claim simply for no other reasoning other than that you want to prove that the ability is useless as you put the worst.Its farther than a stretch its just loose association and baseless. Mereum is a super powered being like in Halo. In Halo Spartans have super strength akin to some HxH characters. In Halo they can assassinate strong beings from behind in most contexts. Its makes about as much sense as your example except slightly more. Because in HxH killing people isnt always easy for every character. But in Dishonored killing anything is extremely easy. As easy as stopping time and placing a bullet in front of their face. Its easy because the difficulty comes in maneuvering and keeping stealth up.gtSure but his dogs do all the menial tasks that you could literally just employ people to do. Its a bit of a fuckin stretch to say that just because they arnt under your total control that theyre gonna betray you. Its not that hard to find loyal employees if you pay well and treat fairly.Theres a lot to address here. Basically youre saying that just because we didnt see him use his ability for more useful purposes that he cant? Once again silly assumption. Just because they arent manipulated doesnt mean they wont betray you? Sure but whats the chance of them betraying you while manipulated?  How many other variables do you introduce by trying to convince or hire someone to do something? Countless.You think it will be easy to always be able to find someone that is  trustworthy? Even if you pay someone theres nothing to say that that person will even carry out that plan. They may betray you or just give up or make a mistake such as mishearing or forgetting. It is very unpredictable to rely on someone else to do something for you unless you worked with them and trained them for years building up trust. Even then betrayals often happen from those you trust most.Find loyal employees do you have much work experience? It is near impossible to find loyal employees at the drop of a hat. Even then a loyal employee is loyal because it isnt like you are asking them to spy on the mafia deliver secret messages or help you kill someone. I mean the notion that you can just find a person for any little thing you want to do is just...I dont even know the word for it. Laughable I suppose. Thats not even remotely close to realistic as far as people are concerned. Regardless of pay and treatment...gtLike instead of amassing a huge harem of dogs have an ability that focusses on  or  dogs that gives him greater control over themWe dont know what his degree of control was over the massive amounts of dogs he had but it was alluded to that he had major control over them and that is what we were shown in the brief time he was in the show. gtAbility to see and hear their senses which would in turn enhance his own because of dogs enhanced senses.We dont know that he couldnt do this. Or do we and I missed something?gtYou didnt say anything about my point of the heavens arena being stronger than a dogIm not even sure what point you are making. gtbut GampK murdering them without batting an eye without nen.They steam rolled the bottom floor nonNen users then Gon got stomped by one of the weakest Nen users in the series. Now because they are statistical anomalies they are super human even by HxH standards and were able to surpass them with just a month or two of training but still that was one of the weakest users in the series and GampK are some of the most OP in terms of their potentials. I still dont get the point you are making about Heavens Arena.gtDont take this as rude but youre arguing some points with a pretty condescending tone.Its not rude to point it out.

Yet again Im a little bitch for that adaptation so I have a slight bias towards it also the Leorio dub isnt too bad in  neither but have yet to see the  dub of him.

The last PG movie that I could give a similar praise to a for kids movie thats good for all ages would be Inside Out. Despite its cheesiness Id say its a solid  if you ask me depending on the day.

If Im making you mad I apologize and theres no need to continue the matter.Chrollos Bookmark is another ability that allows him to more fully utilize Skill Hunter. Bookmark itself is not a limitation. It is a freedom from Skill Hunters limitations. Feitan never charged with the sun and thats a very strong ability. Genthru never charged with gunpowder and... Meh. Hisoka does not charge with gum and it is a very adaptable ability. The very fact that Killua does means that he is incapable of using his aura efficiently and needs a jumpstart. Transmutation does not use up the transmuted properties in the majority of cases and the fact that Killua has the only transmutation hatsu that weve seen charged does not mean he has a condition it means he should be out of aura if we are to use a consistent transmutation model.gtBiscuit and Tsezguerras comments prove it.Biscuit said that it was a talent through torture. Her comment was more on his emotional state. Tsezguerras comment was on the speed of his learning in manga chapter . Electricity is nothing special.  days is.  The ability never backfired on him. However if he had been like Wait gotta charge up! In front of Tsezguerra he would have laughed at him.gtHe had enough electricity in himself to use Narukami on Youpi then Godspeed and then electrocute him while Godspeed was active a few times.Thats a pittance. He did nothing but annoy Youpi and he literally would have died without Meleoron. gtKillua needed a strong ability in a very short amount of time but one that unlike Gons Jajanken was usable in combat.The one time Killua used Lightning Palm on Sub the game that he made his Hatsu for it was ineffective against him. He did not use electricity with that in mind all the way in Greed Island. I agree that it shouldnt be a perfect Nen ability but the need to charge after every electrical action? That is not worth a dime. No combat effectiveness with a need to charge and he doesnt even get the speed steroid. Charging for Lightning Palm and Lightning Bolt is not a condition its an unnecessary hindrance for a hatsu that never worked. Godspeed could very well need charged as it is powerful. The two preexisting abilities needing charged is laughable.gthe just wanted to punch the heck out of himHe only planned  punches and he still ran out in front of his opponent. ch,HunterXHunter,df1b7jm,1,t5_2spu5

I dont think anyone can join by just killing a member we have heard this rule from Hisokas mouth so its hard to know the ones who want to become members should probably first prove their loyalty and belief in the spiders ideologies and then do a fight as an entrance test.gt he talked to everyone politely and friendly but we dont see him fawning over others or manifesting his love and appreciation. How do you expected Chrollo to express his love and appreciation? Like did you expect him to walk around and hug the members one by one or something like that?gt TBH I think that Chrollo didnt seem to be bothered by Pakunodas death.Chrollo wast bothered because he didnt see it. I mean what scene are you talking about? After Pakus death we only saw Chrollo for a moment in GI arc and thats not enough to find how he felt and it was not even clear if he knew about Pakus death yet then because he couldnt contact the spiders at that time. Next time we saw him was a long time after Pakus death. Of course he was over with it already.gt In fact when I was watching HxH for the first time when Pakunoda came alone to exchange the hostages with Kurapika Chrollo looked disappointed upset and angry to me it seemed so.You were correct to think so but his disappointment was not because he despised Paku or something like that but because she had made the wrong move Chrollo knew that Kurapika wasnt going to sacrifice his friends but Paku didnt get that. He also couldnt talk or even make a gesture in front of Paku because of chain jail so it made him look even more gloomy.gt Chrollo might have this kind of an ideology Youre worth mourning for only if you follow every order that I give and die fighting for me.Well of course there is something like that as I said before the spider comes before the individual members. But this doesnt contradict anything. Even in real world its the same in many cases. The me I made bold should be replaced with spider I think.As you guessed Ive not seen that anime unfortunately gt Machi said that Chrollo probably wanted the Chain User to join the Troupe. This makes him all the more extremistesque as then there was no reason for such a RequiemMachi is weird. I even doubt her loyality after what she did after a certain fight...gt Moreover Uvo has to be one of the mostloved characters of the PT loved by the Spiders themselves so I guess Shalnarks death should have a similar impact on Chrollo too Who cares about Kortopi?.gt But hey then Paku was an original member tooSo far weve only seen Chrollos reaction to one members death and that was Uvos. For Paku everyone was visibly sad and they even made a grave for her and put flowers and candles and such. I dont know why you think Chrollo wouldve acted any different.

11281138,0,t3_60x593,Hisoka is dangerous but Illumi casts doubt on the matchup IMO. First off hed very likely need to be out of character to accept fighting them as he fights on the basis of escape if victory isnt assured. One look at Morel and Knov and hed start having doubts immediately. That hesitation will be what puts him and Hisoka at a serious disadvantage.Even assuming Illumi were to fight his power seems to be one of those bully powers like Genthrus loses usefulness exponentially the stronger his opponents are. Unless of course he has some kind of trump card which I honestly have little reason to doubt.Overall its hard not to give Morel and Knov the edge. But no matter which side wins its gonna be one hell of a fight.,HunterXHunter,dfap85n,5,t5_2spu5
11291814,0,t1_dfafqpu,To be honest I was kind of underwhelmed by them. Knov seemed to have a decent ability for utility purposes but next to none in combat. Did we ever see him fight something that wasnt a normal chimera ant? Morel seems like a capable combatant but I never felt that he had a lot of firepower. Again it felt like he mostly brought utility to the table with smoke screens and decoys. I dont know I really wanted to like them. If you have some insight into why you want to give them more credit than my first viewing showed me Id love to hear it.,HunterXHunter,dfbwsw1,3,t5_2spu5

11312343,0,t1_dfe0ssp,I disagree that the Phantom Troupes only allure is edginess though. One because part of me wishes that the word edgy was removed from the English language but two because there is actual depth and interest to their characters that I and many others find appealing. While I would agree that Chrollo typically gets more love from people than I personally give him that doesnt mean that I cant see why that is and where that love is founded aside from him looking cool.,HunterXHunter,dfe8it3,9,t5_2spu5

11327257,0,t3_61nsri,First of all In conceal aura so if you conceal a part of your aura you need to make your opponent think you arent going all out for a reason.Then some people uses it but its not said every time like Silva probably used it when he attacked Cheetuh or Morel when he was poisonning Leol.

11338476,0,t1_dfh66fm,I agree that the troupe has done a lot of horrible things but in the grand scheme of things the HA has bigger priorities imo. Just the amount of intel needed to track them down and predicting where their next heist is gonna take place is difficult. They knew where the ants were and how dangerous they would be so they had to act immediately.Same thing with Illumi they had ALL the hunters gathered in one place which almost never happens and the criminal was basically just outside their door.Story wise I dont think it makes much sense either since Togashi has been building up the Meteror City faction from the middle of the yorknew arc.

11542233,0,t1_dg401uk,The fact that you even mentioned OP and Naruto AND that you actually think HunterxHunter has any significant character development makes me think you havent really seen a lot of anime at all.When I say character development I dont mean learning bigger and better powers I mean changing and growing and developing as a character through some kind of character arc. I also dont mean simply learning more about who a character already and calling that growth. I mean looking at where a cahracter starts and then looking at where they end and seeing significant differences in personality affect etc. HunterxHunter has  episodes and it does some things right but character development is NOT one of them lmao.Here are some basic examplesMewtwohates humans because of the way they treated him then realizes humans arent all bad after ash convinces him by showing him how much he a human loves pokemon better version of meruemLord genome helps out simon in the fight against the antispiral even though when he first showed up fighting the antispiral is the exact thing he was trying to avoid because he believed they couldnt win.Vegeta goes from believing anything that isnt a saiyan is beneath him to fucking FALLING IN LOVE WITH BULMA and starting a HALF HUMAN family. still calls goku by his saiyan name ONLYjust to remind you of who he used to be.Gon Stubborn instinctual tempermental kid who wants to find his dad.episode  Gets a rageboner so big that he sacrifices his own lifeforce to kill a chimera ant who killed kitesomthing he believes to be his fault a friend of Gings and thus killed the closest he hasGons character development is unprecedented in the history of shounen manga.

11577052,0,t3_65709n,gtIm  episodes in and its already fairly hype. Theyre already doing this hunter exam!Unlike the other series youve referred towith the exception of Jojo obviously Nothing is needlessly dragged out in the  anime. I believebut am not necessarily correct this is partly because the  covered the first half of the series in significant detail in true s style  that said something is still always happening they just dont skip over certain thingswhich I personally feel is missing  on the whole it adds to the series. Once the  catches up there is a drastic pacing changewell the pacing slows a little for the soft catchup too  excluding OVAs but it is definitely worth pushing through at that point  its more an issue of Directionpartially stemming from production of the source material than the actual story but youll probably find it jarring nonetheless.,HunterXHunter,dg89ju8,2,t5_2spu5

Or if Chrollo actually died hed become useless.I think a better explanation is that the Troupe is made up of the some of the strongest and most twisted people in the HxH universe and their only unifying thread is their connection to Chrollo and their hometown.

11717730,0,t1_dgo6q06,Not that guy but heres my two cents. Chrollo doesnt order Illumi to do it its explicitly stated that Chrollo hired him.As for his motives I think its not about the money. After all the Zoldycks are clearly loaded and if all he was after was financial gain assassinating the  dons would be a lot easier. Not to mention theres probably a lot of easier ways for the Zoldycks to make money besides assassinating people considering how strong they are.I feel for Zeno its more about the lifestyle of being a good assassin like some kind of noble pursuit or for self satisfaction. Zeno says we simply do the job were hired to which suggests to me its some kind of code he lives by. Which would still fit the description of not fighting for nothing. I think that line sheds the most light on it. Zeno and Illumi were both hired and so they both attempted the jobs even though they were opposed.I think for the Zoldycks assassination is their way of life. After all why would they be so insistent on Killua becoming an assassin? They clearly dont need his help and he can support himself easily. All their actions only make sense imo if they are not after financial gain. ,HunterXHunter,dgo8feq,1,t5_2spu5

The more attached they are to the object of choice the stronger their abilities will be. Someone stated that he might be able to conjure a phone with antennas in a pinch but thats not garuanteed either. Weve only seen cheetu do this and in his case hes a conjurer and the crossbow ability was shit. Black voice is a really strong ability and for a manipulator with  in conjuration it should be impossible to use with conjured objects unless its effects are sacrificed greatly.,HunterXHunter,dgthrav,5,t5_2spu5
