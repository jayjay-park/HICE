5072684,0,t1_cuxbkev,The challenge merely says use tone technique I assume this would mean you can use it as strictly or as loosely as any composer throughout history has done.And I agreed with you that its an odd choice for a first submission my main problem was your assessment that twelvetone composition is more mathematical than musical.,MonthlyComposition,cuxg84z,2,t5_39rqy
5430146,0,t1_cw5oilv,Hmm maybe I can explain it. The important thing to remember is that although there is a strict structure for a fugue Bach and others didnt always adhere to that structure. They took liberties for the sake of their art and you can too.So a fugue has three main sections. The opening section is sometimes called the exposition. The exposition begins with the subject the theme that will be featured throughout the fugue heard alone in one voice. Then another voice enters playing the answer. The answer is just the subject transposed to the dominant or sometimes the relative major key for example if my fugal subject was in C minor Id put the answer in G minor like Bach does here The answer can be real or tonalin a real answer the pitches of the subject are transposed exactly in a tonal answer they arent. Tonal answers like the one in the piece I linked are used when you need to change the subject a little to get the harmonies to work the way you want them to. If there are more voices they all come in gradually one at a time just like the first two voices did. Each of them plays either the subject or the answer when they first come in. Often composers will throw in things called countersubjects. A countersubject is a theme thats frequently heard throughout the fugue against the subject. So when one voice is playing the subject another voice might be playing one countersubject and another still might be playing a second countersubject. Once all the voices have played the subjectanswer once the exposition can be ended. Or if you want to keep going you can put in redundant entries which are just more occurences of the subject or answer. Oh and one more thing in between occurrences of the subject and answer there are occasionally codettas which are short passages that spice up the exposition and help you modulate between the tonic and dominant keys if you need it.Next comes the middle section. While the opening section was quite strict in form the middle section gives you a lot more freedom. The middle section alternates between subject entries and episodes. A subject entry is just when one voice plays the subject. It can be in any key you want! The middle section is the time for a lot of modulation. In the Baroque era fugue composers tended to stick to the related keys that is the tonic I subdominant IV and dominant V keys and their relative majorminors. You dont need to stick to those if you dont want to though. The subject entries alternate with episodes. Episodes are where you take fragments of material from the subject and countersubjects and manipulate them to make something cool. They often feature sequencesthe same passage repeated progressively higher or lower. Sequences allow you to easily modulate to a new key for the next subject entry. Once youve gotten bored of the middle section its time to move on to the final section.The final section consists of the last subject entry and sometimes a coda. By this point you need to modulate back into the tonic key. The last subject entry is in the tonic keythis confirms the tonality. Sometimes theres a coda after this. A coda is just an additional little bit at the end of the piece that helps give it a sense of finality. The fugue should end on the tonic chord.I think thats about all there is to fugues. If I missed anything or got something wrong someone please correct me! I realize a lot of the concepts I mentioned might benefit from an example so heres an example fugue Also listen to some fugues and follow along with sheet music and try to identify the different parts I mentioned.,MonthlyComposition,cw5r95g,3,t5_39rqy
