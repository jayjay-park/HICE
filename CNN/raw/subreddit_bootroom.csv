16892,0,t3_1uap0g,Defending can be split into  positions the st defender the nd defender amp the rd defender.The st defender is the player closest to the ball wherever it is on the pitch so the st defender could be a striker.The nd defender is the player nd closest to the ball amp the rd defender is everyone else.It is the job of the st defender to put pressure on the player with the ball it is not their job to tackle amp win the ball if they do win the ball by applying pressure then that is a bonus but their main job is to make the player with the ball make a mistake or make a pass. If either of those  things happen the st defender has done their job.We teach our players these  things about being the st defender Get there quickly. Slow down dont dive in. Jockey the player with the ball.I suspect  is why youre getting beaten dont get too close to the player with the ball amp dont try to tackle them put the pressure on them so its they who make the mistake not you.,bootroom,cegcuse,6,t5_2s927

152940,0,t3_1vtwrf,The answer for your questionFull backs  Philipp Lahm! No one better than him for that position. He doesnt have any advantage in size but he makes up for it with his amazing ability to read the game and execute perfect tackles.CB  Either Thiago Silva or Vidic from back in . These two are some of the best CBs of modern day football. Their ability to read the game and be a physical presence in the defending half is really outstanding.Defensive Mid  Schweinsteiger or Busquets. Both are amazing at reading the game and are really good at building up play from the back aswell.Creative Mid  Rooney  Ronaldinho from his barca days  Wilshere. They all have different styles of play but one thing that they have incommon is that all three of them play for the team and are able to create chances out of nothing.Wingers  Giggs in his older days  Hazard. Again two really creative and pacy wingers. Their ability to find the perfect pass from the wing and setting up goals is really topclass.Strikers  Messi  Klose. They are different types of strikers but both excel in their style of play. While Messi is a creative striker Klose is a goal poacher. You can learn alot from both of them.That being said watching all these players would not benifit your game too much. You should chose a position for yourself first and then pick up on how to play in that position. Learning all the different positions doesnt come till after you are done with your initial position.,bootroom,cevunp3,15,t5_2s927

The other foot theyll use to try to get the ball. Since they cant move the planted foot you want to slip the ball past them as close to that planted foot as possible. Usually defenders anticipate you going around wide so theyll poke the free foot out wide creating the gap to meg.

More than anything I was and am extremely dilligent. Because I had just returned from Japan at age  I was jobless aside from some translation work I was doing and lived with my mom is that a bad thing at ? I dont really think so but Ive been out of the USA for too long to remember. This meant I had unreal amounts of free time but living in rural Indiana I didnt have access to awesome facilities or even a rec team. Just me a ball a crappy field that luckily had two goals and some friends who never kicked a ball but were interested.While they were at school I would be at the field everyday fascinated by this game. It was just really fun. Man its like the when you first start going out with the girl of your dreams. Kicking running juggling and all of that jazz was just so fun. I would get giddy just to have the chance to play with it. And I had so much free time. Socially crippling amounts of free time because everyone else was in school. So I spent about  hours a day at the field dribbling juggling and just kicking. If someone strolled by with cleats and a ball Id beg them to play with me and learned from every experience.By the time I was  I moved to Japan and joined a th division team. And man did I suck the youth squad would murder me. But my athleticism was the best in the league hands down. Even the former pros who played in this low level league would ask me questions about my speed and strength. One defender in his thirties who was a Japanese national player back in the s likened me to foreigners hed played against in his hayday. My dilligence was as strong as ever and I was putting in more socially crippling amounts of practice. Got a Japanese girlfriend who wanted to have kids and get married and as much as I liked her the relationship didnt work out. I still remember our last arguementWhich is more important me or soccer!?What the hell? SOCCER! And then I was single.Fast forward to me being picked up by a th division team in Nagano one level below pro the JFL and I was instantly seen by Niigata in the first divsion this team has a few national players in it one whos actually a New Zealand national player lol.Will I make it out of this reserve squad? Hell I have no idea. Im  surrounded by Japanese players younger than me whove already played professionally SOMEWHERE and most who have represented their country at least once. Im just this guy from the corn fields of Indiana whos too hardheaded to give up. I do know this at the level Im at right now I can at least shoot for third division which is still technically pro. From there I can just work hard while making a crappy amount of money and hopefully get seen from there. Im actually sitting on my laptop in the clubhouse right now.Moral of the story if you have cosmic amounts of free time the same dilligence of a demigod and a lot of athleticism then go to a country other than the USA for football. Our system doesnt look too kindly on people who didnt go through the rigidass system in place and is it working? Uh... hopefully the European clubs dont kill us this year like they always do on their preseason USA trips to kill the Chicago Fire again ugh.Or go for a MLS tryout. Those happen pretty often. NASL could happen I have a connection to the Indy Eleven if everything goes to pits here and wouldnt mind playing in my home state.TLDR cosmic amounts of free time athleticism dilligence LUCK.,bootroom,cp9zp6r,2,t5_2s927

4921613,0,t3_3i9sqo,Can only give from my personal experienceEveryone wants to be a shot stopper acrobatic style keeper.  Few truly can be. Get good at reading angles and learning how to cut them out.  Every action you make before a shot is taken to give that attacker the worst possible angle you possibly can. Make it difficult for them.  Ever notice how Goalies crouch and get low when the approach a ball? Its not just to pick it up you are changing the available angels to the attacker. Tied into this is learning when to come off your line and when to stay home.  Its not easy and is largely built through experience and instict.  There are very akward growing pains in this.  Youll make yourself look like a fool a lot more often than a hero at first.  There is no lower feeling than coming off your line to cut out a cross and realizing youve misjudged and the other team has a tap in now.  That all would of been avoided if youd just done nothing.Commit.  No matter what once youve made a decision commit.  Even at the highest level goalies who waver in their decision are almost always worse off than if they had just made the wrong decision and tried to make the best out of it.  If you decide to come off your line follow it all the way through.  If you decide to stay home. STAY HOME!  Dont start and then stop it almost always results in you looking like a fool and ultimately giving the attack a better situation.Tied in with this you have to be comitted to being comitted.  Youre going to get hit and kicked a lot.  You are going to find yourself in challenges that are wholey unenjoyable even though you are going to win them.  Literally never be afraid to see a challenge through to the end.Remember the Top  saves are spectacular they are also the easier ones to make.  Its much easier to jump up than it is to throw yourself to the ground.  Dont get in the habit of making saves on low range shots with your legs unless you have to.  You will have no to very limited control over where the ball ends up after.Learn to punt the ball and throw it on target.  Especially in rec leagues a goalie that can distribute is a huge advantage and not all that common around me anyways.  It looks easy but to do it consistently and get it to go  yards is hard.  From personal experience when I was younger you dont want to be that goalie that has their goal kicks taken for them by a defender because your distribution or power is such shit. Trust me.Only  things can happen on penalties.  The shooter scores.  The goalie gets lucky.  The shooter misses.  Embrace this.  It is a situation made to give the attacking team a goal well almost. So dont beat yourself up.  Remember youre there to have fun and not look like you are paying your taxes. Also notice that on a PK a goalie makes  actions.  First is the hotstepjump off the line toward the PK taker technically illegal but allowed almost everywhere even at the highest level and then the dive to guessing where the kick is going.  Again reducing angles.As for shot stopping that is something you have or dont.  A goalie without it can do a servicable job but its pretty evident theyre a square peg in a round hole.  But you can work on it.  Recation time throwing a ball off a wall rapidly. Develop those twitch reflexes.YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE GAME.  The comparison is made all the time but you are the quarterback.  You need to know how to organize your defense.  COMMUNICATE danger they may not see.  Or even if they do its something you are conerned with.  Because remember unlike every other player on the pitch you are in the rare position to see every single player infront of you.  Every other player will be turning back to front side to side the game moves with them and around them.  But for you the game is always infront of you.  You have the advantage of being able to see things they cant.,bootroom,cuewomf,2,t5_2s927
4953740,0,t3_3iqmgt,When your teammates are looking to play entry passes to you check to the ball. Basically you need to come meet the ball as youre receiving it  At least one of those defenders will follow you but you should be able to gain possession and then make a decision based on other circumstances have enough spaceskill to turn your defender lay the ball off to a teammate play the the ball through to a teammate making a run.Ex.  Say youre being marked by both CBs. One of your CMs has the ball and is looking to play to you.. Check to the ball as he plays it ensuring that you receive it. For the sake of this example lets say one of the CBs follows you and is now marking you as you have the ball with your back to goal.. You lay the ball off to one of your teammates and immediately move out of that space and give your teammate another passing option. That CB that was marking you now has a decision to make  do they follow the ball and press up on your teammate or do they try and track you as you move into new space.. If the defender follows the ball and now is trying to mark your midfielder who has possession you are now hopefully SCREAMING to get the ball from him.. Your teammate passes you the ball and now because that CB is out of position you can potentially have some time on the ball to make a new decision based on these new circumstances! ie. attack on the dribble play another pass take a shot.Obviously soccer is a game of a million microdecisions based on circumstances and this is just ONE way the scenario could play out  but hopefully this gives you an idea of how you can still be productive when marked heavily.,bootroom,cuiyj9z,3,t5_2s927

8953059,0,t3_52trea,Teach them to shoot the gap. My current defenders and defensive mids often have trouble with this. Players are frequently timid in their challenges so explaining how one can stick ones body in between the ball and the opposing player can be a very valuable skill. If the opposing player doesnt have the ball they cant perform moves or passes to deceive the defenders anymore. This form of defending is very effective under the right circumstances.Additionally discuss the idea of patience. Many defenders have problems diving into tackles prematurely often getting cut by wingers or other attackers. You must teach them to withhold from such immature defending and instead wait until the attacker makes a mistakein the form of a poor touch for instanceor looks up to put a foot in. Often defenders are taught to trouble opposition enough such that they dont feel comfortable looking up and are stuck with the ball at their feet.Id also add that teaching the fundamental of defending sidewayson rather than square is crucial. The ability to redirect players and avoid getting nutmegged is essential. Similarly teaching them to follow the player on s instead of blindly following the ball will make them improve as defenders too. Often times I yell at my players to watch and focus on the ball itself rather than the opposing players legs or body movements. Advanced players know how to read these things but younger less experienced ones tend to be easily duped by the dropping of a shoulder or a faked shot. If you train yourself to keep your eyes on the ball youll be much less distracted by any moves that the attacker performs.And lastly my biggest tip that I had in mind back when I played CB was the following motto let the ball by or the mannot both. Teach your players to play physically.,bootroom,d7o0voi,1,t5_2s927

9551557,0,t3_5bpvdx,If your team cannot do goal kicks properly then it is a huge liability.First of all its ideal for the GK to be taking them however if he cannot get the ball  of the way down the field then it is acceptable for a CB to take them provided that he can do so. Goalkick technique   The ball needs to have backspin ! You accomplish this by leaning way back and by having a contact with the ball where your foot toe pointed down comes through the bottom half of the ball. You want a low trajectory The higher the ball goes in the air the easier it is for the opposing teams defence to manage it. This unfortunately is not the case with amateurs it is possible to shell an amateur back  to death with long kicks and pounce on their mistakes. A polished back  will not make those mistakes and as such you want to keep a low trajectory so that your strikers can see the ball and their teams arrangement at the same time you cant look at the ball up high and your strikers run down low at the same time.If they dont have the legs for the kick then you need to get comfortable playing short.EDIT  I went ahead and drew out a quick diagram of what a good goalkick setup might look like both teams  ideally you are kicking blue team  into a group of players who are positioned in a triangle orange triangles In this case the right wing is much better positioned than the left to recieve the ball as a triangle group. The red triangle represent what I like to call the line pocket basically it is a space where the player receiving the kick usually the RM or RF can control the ball while facing their own goal towards the touchline. This is really useful at the higher levels where opponenets will not let you bring the ball down and turn with it as it will make it much safer for the receiving player and there wont be as much of a risk of counter attack right off the bat should they fail to bring the kick down.Also consider this video that I made a while ago talks about dividing the responsibility of a difficult long pass between two players by means of a knock back. ,bootroom,d9qfd99,11,t5_2s927

11587676,0,t1_dg9c61t,Im from California so it may be different but our academies do hold open tryouts even if they arent really looking for players through them.  Some academies are invite only in which case you need to find out who the coach is and find a way to get seen camp private lesson guest player.  If youre not already in the system at your age academy may be a tough place to start.  Id be looking online for local clubs contacting coaches that have teams your age and ask to come workout.  If youre good theyll pick you up or likely have resources to move you onto a lower level team.  This time of year I let whoever wants work to come out regardless of skill level.,bootroom,dg9gxxx,1,t5_2s927

11674242,0,t1_dgj9dos,Thank you very much.gt  its more like you need to be a certain strength and size to be able to put your effort into generating spin rather than needing to use all your effort to get the ball into the box.Like it really depends on the right amount of strength? What do you mean with size?,bootroom,dgjai8h,1,t5_2s927
11683875,0,t1_dgk9nqx,Lot of guys in mls play on AG and not all of them wear AG boots. All I am saying is if the injury risk is the only factor preventing you from wearing them I personally wouldnt refrain from using them. Ive played a decade on AG and FG all with FG boots. Coached kids that do the same. Never been a problem. If an ACL is gonna tear its likely down to an impact overusefatigue or poor supporting muscle development. Buying boots thinking they will prevent an ACL or MCL is not really a solution. ,bootroom,dgkdumz,3,t5_2s927
