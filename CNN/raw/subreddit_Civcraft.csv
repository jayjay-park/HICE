Mobs wouldnt be attacking random lavabombers theyd be attacking people like the dildos or gimmick brigade  people who actually know what theyre doing. Even with me training on civpvp for months and grinding out two sets of prot on two seperate accounts Heisenburg can just waltz into the city when  people are on kill the two of us with prot and me twice and the only thing that the entire populace of the town can do is hide. Not to mention theres more important things to be doing than focusing on defense. People who are actually any good in cities tend to be focusing on that with all of their playtime. Ever since Ive set my mind to trying to donate less prot to dildos I havent had time to build jack shit. Itd be even worse for all of these newer players who have only been around for about a month and you expect them to know how to get better and have access to enough capital to actually produce factories at a decent pace. Some people would rather focus on architecture or trade or politics or some other shit. If we want civcraft to live up to . cities then you cant expect everyone to always have gear and to train themselves to beat dildos. Im not proposing we give them much either  its like pitch forks against medieval knights.

55902,0,t3_1uqvah,gtA couple nights ago Cheshirelulcat a previous shareholder of Stoneburrow confirmed a long held fear of mine given enough time he would force us Staffenburg and myself tomgive up control of the city to him else we he would do it by force by pearling us. You can find a full thread on the situation here.Never forced you. I ended up leaving Id rather avoid violence. If I wanted to force you youd have been pearled a while ago.gt With the separation almost official all that was left was to pay Chesh. Before we had time to do so however his people asked for diamonds as well. We declined refusing to pay anyone without stock in the company. We were not obligated to do so either as the contract was already set in stone.I just asked around nobody has the only possible person to ask is Thymos. He personally bought FIVE enchanted diamond picks to help us dig out the tiers in hopes that he would be digging out his plot. I dont ever remember a time when you showed enough dedication to SB to buy diamond tools to help us speed up the work.gt Knowing that his citizens would not be payed Chesh decided to ask for another d in addition to the  we agreed to pay him. The contract states that he would receive d so that is all he was entitled to. We denied Cheshs request for more stating that he would receive his half stack of diamonds or none at all. Though we figured hed just take the d and be done with the situation.Once again this was more of a suggestion as you can see in my posts. I never said it was a hard limit. I said ...Id like  please. Never a hard limit.gt After hearing that he would not receive his d but rather  Cheshire retaliated by griefing our farms. Not only had he asked for more diamonds than the contract we agreed to alotted him he resorted to violence when he didnt get his way. By breaking and stealing Stoneburrow property the wheat he had voided his half of the contract and therefore we were no longer obligated by it to pay him. Staffenburg and I immediately ejected Cheshirelulcat from the company without payment and took ownership over all his shares.You did not aid either me or any of the other workers with the farms and told us it was migrant labour and plebeian work as far as I can recall. We tended to the fields replanted and harvested them and as the seeds were my personal property as well as my personal labour as well as shared labour with the current inhabitants of Tiro I took what was mine including part of my personal belongings from my house which you griefed and I turned the wheat into XP and put it towards Tiros coffers now. gtFast forward to Monday Chesh has settled with his people k blocks to the south in a city he calls Tiro. Settled on the same island as Calastine the individuals Staffen and I originally thought were taking Suilven through hostile force Tiro joined their empire and worked out a defense agreement.In the event that Tiro is attacked Calastinenwould defend them ala Petrania style. This wall of text goes here.I never said anything like that. I replied to your insinuating comment of ...I know where Tiro is... implying that you planned on either  griefingstealing killingpearlingthe town and I politely informed you that if anything were to happen to Tiro on its land as the devliof and FuzzyGoodle situation last night showed Calastine would come to our defense. I never stated that we were going to invade or intend to use or trick the Calastinians into fighting for me.As a result Im really sorry I brought up the government issue I wish we were just friends again and Im really sorry for all of this drama. But lying isnt the way to go. gt.lt,Civcraft,cekslxd,4,t5_2tm1t
55913,0,t3_1upjdh,Idea Having less prot and potions would make individuals and small groups less powerful over the many which is the problem right now. That is it is a problem to developing civilization on the server. If there was no advanced weaponry then the power would be in numbers of people themselves. People would naturally form large communities of likeminded people. And then politics would be even stronger than it is now.As has been said by some of the elite PVPers that they put in the time to train in PVP and acquire their fighting gear. With that even one or a handful of them can wreak an entire community at will which is what we are seeing now. I understand that they put in the time to practice PVP and put their diamonds and XP to weapons but what about the rest of us who want to create a civilization and play epolitics? As I wrote it only takes one or a couple people in prot to determine the fate of a citystate with a much larger population.The simplest way to increase civilization and politics on the server is to get rid of such powerful armor and weaponry and potions. That way what happens in the server will largely be affected by the collective will of large groups of people who are banded together in different civilizations and not just a dozen PVPers.If there was no armor and weaponry like Prot  fire aspect swords and potions the server could easily repel a small number of invaders from other servers like HCF should that happen again in the same way that a city could defend itself from some griefers.Whether for good LADS or bad HCF I dont think any small group of people should be able to destroy large populations at will. It is like having a terminator in the age of cavemen.,Civcraft,ceksnk0,1,t5_2tm1t

It took me many years I was learning of new mechanics after  years of playing... but eventually I had done everything.It eventually gets to the point where any rewarding venture for me in eve simply takes far too much effort compared to the enjoyment I get out of it. For example theses are things I find fun Station day trading  billion revenue a day. Requires  hour of updating orders a day more time needed to analyze markets Large scale Starbase Reaction chains.  hours a week to manage Capital fights. Multiple accounts huge time investment to stay involved in an alliance Wormholes. Need to log in daily to scan wormholeclose bad exits. PVE. I fly a ship worth  billion ISK. Make mil and hour. Simply too dangerous to fly in High Security suicide gankers. Instead have to use it in Nullsec which requires watching intel channels and being on mumbleteamspeak. Usually takes min to an Hour just to get started and up to speed on local intel to make sure space is relatively safe.However one think I still enjoy is the Meta.

I think the biggest hole in Citadel is that it doesnt force you to be in a primary group. It allows you to be a citizen of as many places as you want and you dont really have to settle. If there was a primary group system it would allow you to open up tech tree advances only if you had X number of players in that primary group and players would actually be forced to make real decisions about where to live. Having a large number of active citizens would actually allow you be more productive.Its not an easy solution thats why I dont bring it up but thats how it would operate in my ideal world.,Civcraft,cf5xvv6,1,t5_2tm1t

From where things stand its currently plausible that you havent noticed any women or considered them because they are women whether youre consciously deciding so doubtful or subsconsciously maybe or most likely maybe your own social sphere among Civcrafters simply puts you in sparse contact with the women so you have less chance of noticing them.If you want women to be on the server and enjoy it there has to be representation of their perspective in the construction of this environment.

Politics and conflict are brought from the unknown people kill and are killed by what they fear and are feared by. When you have a subreddit and a mumble and all of that everyone knows of eachother theres no fear of the unknown you know what everyone does its like a gossipy high school. Sure politics can happen but even stuff like the Bohr Island event stuff was all a joke and planned out from the star as admitted today by Jon. The only actual drama thats not made up or whatever stems from people who dont give a fuck and just want to cause havok.In games like Rust there is no community theres no overarching sense of commitment to the server that Im playing on. If I join a group of people and they tell me that the people down the valley are bad people and will kill me and to be warey and to kill them if I see them I will most likely follow their advice.On Civcraft its much different you can figure out who those people are and what they stand for. You can talk to them in mumble and they become real human beings we turn into more of a High School or a few little tribes that are scattered around rather than an actual world.In my dream Civcraft there would be no Mumble there would be no names ingamewhich would not be hard to accomplish local chat might be lower Im not sure the map would be larger but nether travel would be enabled and there would be no SubReddit. As long as we have a feeling of community there will never true politics on this server other than petty high school equivocal bullshit. By the way I use the analogy of a tribe more because it really is more like a tribe than high school. I imagine us all like different little tribes of say Saxons or something all living in a very small area all close to eachother all with our own differences but all working together becuase we all feel solidarity to our Saxon or Civcraft people. Then maybe some other tribes come like the Mongols big and scary or maybe the HCF? We all band together and try and stop them as a united people! But thats the only time we really feel politics and its also the times when people get the most butthurt and upset and say OH I WANT REAL POLITICS.The HCF wars and invasions from outside really are the closest we get to real politics because they force us to work together or be destroyed. They help bring us together and realise that were all Civcrafters. Weve had our enemies before and petty dispite but most of the time they go away very quickly and people get over them people may spew bullshit about hating the LADs or hating HCF but when they talk to them on mumble or whatever it humanises them and makes you like them even a smaller bit more. Thats why drama on this server is really run by the people who dont give a fuck.One interesting thing to point out about this is on another server the Grundeswegians and the Founding Prussians played on the Krautchan server. It was based off of the board int which stands for international. Now what this meant was despite the fact the game had and ingame IRC where everyone could talk globally to eachother people spoke different languages. Some people did not speak English which made things quite hard. About maybe a year ago about  Polish people joined the server and founded a Nation none of them could speak good English and most of it was just swear words. Naturally disputes would arise but you cannot solve those through debate or dispute or anything. When you have a bunch of poles saying KURWA FUCK YOU MOTHER and filling the chat with polish and doing things that upset you you generally feel polerised HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Through that it made conflict with them very easy because they were different than us. We could freely go into their territory and slaughter them without mercy and they could do the same to us there was never a mutual understanding because they were different and unknown.tldr I know Im rambling but this is really a point I want to get across is that to have a successful political and civilsation simulator you really need to stress the unknown. If you want nations to start fighting eachother you need to get rid of the subreddit get rid of mumble maybe even get rid of names. As long as there is an overarching feel of COMMUNITY and CULTURE between the people who play on this server as long as they feel like a Civcrafter and not like a member of the nation they are a part of as long as that happens we will only have politics when foreign forces try and invade this server and it wont even be good politics because all they want to do is destroy the server and nothing more. ,Civcraft,cgdncgb,10,t5_2tm1t

746123,0,t3_22p309,gtWhen you get to Manila I would like you to generate a bit key pair and keep it on a floppy disk that you carry on your person at all times. Do not keep it on your hard disk. Anyone could break into your hotel room while youre out and steal that key.gtNow Randy pulls down a menu and picks an item labeled New key. . . . gtA box pops up giving him several KEY LENGTH options  bits     or Custom. Randy picks the latter option and then wearily types in .gtEven a bit key requires vast resources to break. Add one bit to make it  bits long and it becomes twice as difficult. A bit key is twice as difficult yet and so on. By using bit keys Randy and Avi could keep their communications secret from nearly every entity in the world for at least the next several years. A bit key would be vastly astronomically more difficult to break.gtSome people go so far as to use keys  or even  bits in length. These will stop the very best codebreakers on the face of the earth for astronomical periods of time barring the invention of otherworldly technologies such as quantum computers. Most encryption softwareeven stuff written by extremely securityconscious cryptography expertscant even handle keys larger than that. But Avi insists on using Ordo generally considered the best encryption software in the world because it can handle keys of unlimited lengthas long as you dont mind waiting for it to crunch all the numbers.gtRandy begins typing. He is not bothering to look at the screen he is staring out the window at the lights on the trucks and the jeepneys. He is only using one hand just flailing away loosely at the keyboard.gtInside Randys computer is a precise clock. Whenever he strikes a key Ordo uses that clock to record the current time down to microseconds. He hits a key at . and he hits another one at . or about . seconds later. Another . seconds later he hits another one. Ordo keeps track of all of these intervals and discards the more significant digits in this example the . and the . because these parts will tend to be similar from one event to the next.gtOrdo wants randomness. It only wants the least significant digitssay the  and the  at the very ends of these numbers. It wants a whole lot of random numbers and it wants them to be very very random. It is taking somewhat random numbers and feeding them through hash functions that make them even more random. It is running statistical routines on the results to make sure that they contain no hidden patterns. It has breathtakingly high standards for randomness and it will not stop asking Randy to whack on the keyboard until those standards are met.gtThe longer the key you are trying to generate the longer this takes. Randy is trying to generate one that is ridiculously long. He has pointed out to Avi in an encrypted email message that if every particle of matter in the universe could be used to construct one single cosmic supercomputer and this computer was put to work trying to break a bit encryption key it would take longer than the lifespan of the universe.gtUsing todays technology Avi shot back that is true. But what about quantum computers? And what if new mathematical techniques are developed that can simplify the factoring of large prime numbers?gtHow long do you want these messages to remain secret? Randy asked in his last message before leaving San Francisco. Five years? Ten years? Twentyfive years?gtAfter he got to the hotel this afternoon Randy decrypted and read Avis answer. It is still hanging in front of his eyes like the after image of a strobegtI want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil.From the Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson.,Civcraft,cgp39w1,10,t5_2tm1t

In most places this is defined as having legal or physical control of the person.So your second claim falls apart in  areas It wasnt coercion in the real world.   The fact that she agreed would seem to refute the unwelcome part.  Youre also ignoring that she had a nonsexual option to get the reward.

You can also get low assurance domain validation certs through resellers as low as  per year up to  years depending on CA but thats comodo not sure if you want to trust them.    Finally at StartSSL Class  certs are  per year and supposedly you can buy up to  years at that level. I dont know I think you should go with a free  year cert especially considering this is just for mumble.  Yes its more inconvenient having to get a new cert every year but most paid certificates with the same level of validation are much more expensive and would only confer the benefit of being multiyear. I guess you could try resellers because theyre relatively cheap but Im not sure of how they work and would seek clarification from someone familiar with them.

Its extremely obvious to anyone that something is probably hidden there or it just looks like grief.  Second while the CICCarson DOES own the rails when it comes to rails within city property it is courteous to ask the city if its alright if you snitch in the area.Sanwi just for your information the two groups used for the CIC do not contain any snitches  in the old Carson days we had a few different snitch groups.  These days Im not exactly sure how its done but we definitely dont put any snitches on the CIC or Carsonrail groups.  I very rarely placed snitches and any I did were for private property not for Carson stuff so I was notam not always up to date on the snitch groups stuff.  Secondly I wish you would have come to be first rather than posting directly to the subreddit but I understand the desire for some delicious drama.I am sentencing you both to  hours of community service on the rails and ordering you both to hug it out.,Civcraft,chijpr3,9,t5_2tm1t

1248832,0,t1_ci9rywa,Thank you. I apologize for sounding like a dick and I apologize for seeming suspicious. The reason I had logged out and then back in next to razrblade while in Aurora before he chased me down the rail was due to a lagspike I was having I hadnt even noticed razr at the time. I shouldnt have suggested a vault break but I was highly assuming Itaqi would choose the first option rather than the second if this was his doing but it turned out not to be as we know now.I can log on and we can get everything back to normal later today. It was a mistake to blame this on Itaqi I misinterpreted what I was told by razrblade and assumed he was the one who told people to pearl me. This may have scarred my reputation for a while but I hope we can all put this mistake Ive made behind us and think about the future rather than the past.

1511365,0,t3_2bie87,Part The Definition of Isle of ArranThe Isle of Arran as it exists today is an autonomous territory in the  located between the area of Epicus to the south and the Commonwealth in the north with a large unincorporated zone between each. To be clear Isle of Arran is not an island at all. Though it includes multiple large islands in the high plains region they are largely uninhabited. Arran the township in the extreme northeastern part of the territory is the seat of power in that it holds federal sovereignty over the territory to enforce the only real territorywide law kindness to innocents and it serves as a resource to all residents within. Municipalities within the territory are free to enact their own municipal laws and operate at the pleasure of Isle of Arrans Chancellor myself a lifetime selfappoitnment. Two other townships Nyroc and Rapture formed but then collapsed during the Dormancy described below within the territorys borders and one township Benderoma existed previous to the incorporation of Isle of Arran on the western border.The Very Early DaysPrior to the arrival of myself the Arran territory played host to a number of players including two within the townships current area. Rubberfridge lived on an island in the South River just west of the South River Bridge and ewolfe created a home just west of downtown Arran north of the current wheat autoharvester. After some initial griefing of his tiny island home RubberFridge moved his home underground south of the river. Though these two players had contact with one another their properties existed as independent hermitages.Founding of Isle of ArranI moved south from first spawn in what is now the Isle of Arran Wildlife Conservation Area to the low plains near what is now the unincorporated external Arran asset of the Southwestern Coastal Area and formed a settlement with an unremembered newfriend which I subsequently abandoned on the second day for aesthetic differences. I moved to the taiga near the northern point directly south of Arran township. After a few days I decided to move north back to the high plains so that I could more easily create XP to make better tools. I made a hermitage mostly potato farms in what is now the downtown area. After being contacted by Rubberfridge we decided to form an informal town Isle of Arran named after a mostly uninhabited island on the west coast of Scotland that being because my home was in the highland plains. On my way north via tunnel I discovered a diamond vein now passed through by the International Railway and my hermitage was a support system for my mining activities.See Part ,Civcraft,cj5q4px,5,t5_2tm1t

Nobody else griefed and we never knowingly harboured griefers. Blackcat was kicked out of Grundeswald upon solid proof he was blackcat and that crc was Lysen. Sikandar is banned from Grundeswald. Im not sure what your problem is when we do everything ti disassociate ourselves with them and do not harbour nor aid nor abeit them in any manner shape or form and have even worked with bounty hunters to get them pearled as they have damaged Grundeswald just as much as any other town. gtthey associate with jackasses like codecubSue me for knowing someone from a different server not even a valid point just mad because Im friends with someone. gtThey consistently cause tension in every town they settle near.Examples?

1643074,0,t1_cjm9o0y,The short answer is that mostmany ISPs dont like torrenting of any kind at all due to the popular connotations and popular usage of torrenting so any traffic that can be identified as torrent traffic is throttled or slowed. Encrypting the stream makes it very very very difficult to read the traffic so ISPs cannot throttle the traffic.In most torrent clients there is an option under the connections section or peer connections that is labeled something like Outgoing Peer Connection Encryption and Incoming Peer Connection Encryption those two are best set at Encrypted Only or force encryption something along those lines.Edit I forgot to answer the last question. Does it make it easier? Actually no not really it might actually make it slower as there will be less usable peers but it is safer and does cut out most interference from your ISP.,Civcraft,cjm9v83,2,t5_2tm1t

Lets not forget this is in addition to the fact Russia is a homophobic plutocratic antidemocratic ultranationalist fundamentalist oligarchy. LGBT people are second class citizens. The Russian Orthodox Church has more of a say than any other religious organisation.  people own half of the entire fucking countrys wealth. In a country of . million people.The situation is not helped by the other great oligarchy of the world the United States. The US is not a democracy but an oligarchy dictated by corporate interests and lobbies under a broken system whereby the lesser of the same two evils holds power usually. Then we have the state capitalist Peoples Republic of China Saudi Arabia who due to their oil get to disregard human rights the half of Africa where dictators would rather buy a new mansion than provide a decent quality of life to their countrymen...The list goes on. Our greatest hope is the continent of Europe primarily following the example of Scandinavia and the countries to which it has the greatest cultural ties namely Australia New Zealand and Canada. These regions have mastered democracy. If we are to establish global democracy and the complete reformation of Russia the US Saudi Arabia China and other countries we need to create a single united front against oppression. Putin is already seeking this under the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation the CIS and the EAU so every single person in favour of democracy must respond.Once this front has been established the objective will be to use sanctions which reach as far as possible against undemocratic states to bring about their reformation be it gradual or rapid. Such sanctions could include a complete trade ban revocation of UN membership the freezing of the assets of a country and its officials a ban on the trading of a countrys currency a nearcomplete ban on travelling to a country a relaxation of immigration controls for people from a certain country to deprive that country of its labour force the expulsion of all ambassadors of a country the revocation of sports events the blocking of websites based in a countryAnything and everything must be put to use if we are to end oppression from Russia and other countries without exception.,Civcraft,ck5j7gn,2,t5_2tm1t

1966322,0,t1_ckpqgpk,gtWould you not say that aggressive behavior and threats are a reason to hate someone?completely justified if it wasnt the fact that after things settled everyone kept having active hate towards Orion even though ammends were in order to keep things cicil and balanced to everyones liking.gtMy people wished for independence. Am I a bad leader for doing as they please and truly representing them?As everything in life you have to discuss and try to make amends. If a couple of people dont like it will you be voicing the changes even though they are mining everyones opinion? As far as Ive understand the general hate was fueled by a couple people and your way of adressing the matter was let the people do what they want even though you were King and could have taken a firmer stance of you dont like it you can move out. Thats why you own the city. Instead you chose to agree with them meaning you too are displeased with Orion and agree with your peoples concerns. So its not just voicing the opinion but also stating your stance accordingly.gtIs this really what you think of the colonies? Parasites?No thats what I think of you and the people that actually cared for Orion in a cynical way to gather their wealth and then after things dont go your way you just move out instead of working towards a better understanding between everyone. The main sore spot was not having any Senntistenite elected for the NC. And since Senntisten is a large town in the UFO how come they werent elected? Maybe the majority though theyd be better off with other people than their own citizens. That says alot.gtThis is why I had my reserves about representing them.well didnt seem like it. The one person has managed to turn an entire city to get out of Orion territory and not providing feedback. I havent participated in active political life for a long time but I keep criticizing and trying to have my opinion be heard to improve Orion and the formercolonies stance in order to foster cooperation. My effort seems to be in vain because some people just want to build their huts and accumulate diamonds in their alts.gtThey may not leave at any point in time.I might have read it wrongly but they were free to leave if it was their wish. That brings consequences like everything in life beeing inside the former Orion territory. The UFO was created i believe to help Senntisten have their desired independance but ofc dont forget that beeing a part of a Federation has some obligations that apparently neither you or the multiple one persons didnt want to handle.gtWe arent running away now that we lost weve been building up north with the knights for some time now and have been slowly moving that way for just as long.It sure seems like it. Because regardless of all the discussion things seemed to be on their way to help everyone reach a common understanding and allow people to be a part of the UFO as a whole. The been slowly moving away Im not surprised. Its easier to do your own town independant from everything that to work together with other people to be stronger together. Thats the Im pro enough to be alone mindset that Ive been looking at for a couple of weeks.gtThats why were leaving. We dont like you and you dont like us.I used to like Senntisten until all the drama took part that showed little kids with a god complex wanting to be fully independant to do whatever they please without having to work with anybody else. Thats why individual entities often die fast because mst beeing are social beeings and strive in a community.If you decided to move Im not even goign to drop a tear over it. Just hope you guys have the decency of not coming back to Orion like were all friends and you just decided to peacefully leave.Also according to your main post you state that Orionites are mean people and did everything to harm and push Senntisten away. Thats not very fair on your behalf. Hence the spit on the plate you once ate part. And thats something I find a hard time to accept.,Civcraft,ckq55sk,-2,t5_2tm1t

I will provide any resources you need to combat any grief that has occurred and any other assistance you may have in these odd and dire times. Both you and Bizzig are awesome kind civil people however some of you recent residents havent embraced that.This has gotten a bit ridiculous. Olympia has stepped new boundaries and Im concerned if this lunatic is going to wave around his cabinet position and act all mightypowerful when he cannot even listen to basic reason. AlX needs a time out he cant be going around accusing people without any degree of evidence and most of all he needs to learn how to play nice and understand that this game revolves much further than around him and his decisions. His own opinion does not define that of the server.I will retract my bounty on the condition that uMCCivs terms are met as well as  days in the end in any vault including that of Olympias or an essay written on the basis of a modern legal system summarizing the process of being found guilty by a jury of peers with evidence and justification to reason with said jury as well as the limitations on police searches police violence and detention.,Civcraft,cl9nshv,1,t5_2tm1t

2183457,0,t1_clh59sh,Those servers arent a single server they are actually numerous servers. The root of the problem is that minecraft is not multithreaded so if you have a quadcore processor minecraft can only use one core. BukkitSpigot can do certain things on other threads but limited because anymore would require Mojang to rewrite much of Minecraft.A workaround to this is called Bungeecord. It essentially allows you to connect multiple servers together. So those  player servers arent on a single box or even a single server instance. Their resources are actually being utilized by the server hardware itself because they are running multiple minecraft server processes that are connected. Take Badlion one server instance for the hub another for a specific gamemode another for the maps etc. The Civcraft server has a good processor but Minecraft doesnt take advantage of this. Its been in discussion for months on whether or not and how to bungeecord the Civcraft map which would require cutting the map in a extremely messy and intrusive manner. ttk has already explained that we dont even know whether or not a bungeecord setup will be possible in newer minecraft versions due to the bukkit dmca problem. Not counting the fact that our plugins would need to be updated to be compatible with a multiserver setup.Its not a matter of upgrading the server if it was we would do so. Were at the point where optimization needs to come from the software rather than the hardware which is a matter of fixing our current plugins and more.,Civcraft,clhdcgv,3,t5_2tm1t

Not only papa but tons of your members fought with me from fellowship to Danzilonia. Personally papa shocked me he was very reasonable and honestly a great guy. He even offered to pay over a stack of diamond blocks for my release from the Rivers End vault. Now i definitely dont agree with this raid but i understand it. You guys spend tons of time and resources to rid this server of bad guys we called for help you came. You make a group with some loose cannons they do bad things and now the same people who begged for your provided help are bashing you endlessly. Where does that get us? It gets us a lot of pearls with different names. Im no idiot i know you arent freeing these people because you hate permapearling but because you like the people we permapearled. Political i understand it i think its genius. Here is where i can no longer agree you have the power to break these loose cannons out of any vault. Why not hand the pearls over to orion or a third party let them dish out repspunishment. It keeps your group in a better place than most before you and you have the safety of grabbing them if shit hits the fan. If i were you i would do that. But lets be honest here....All these guys commenting on your posts trying to piss you off reddit pvpers are not as skilled in button pressing as you are. And because of that you can control them piss them off or help them. I think those who rage on your posts are kindof stupid i think giving you guys that attention is stupid. I think papapound is a good guy and he did right by our community and instead of extoling him we spat in his face.

2299046,0,t3_2llg1c,gtthere is significant discussion on a github pull to add Diamond blocks as another tier of reinforcement this would dramatically change the cost of vaults. The current argument is that citadel is underpowered when presented with armies of raiders I am not sure how to really feel about that its very delicate balance to mess with citadel reinforcement levels. I would like everyones input.This is an absolutely ridiculous proposal. Just think about it if diamond block reinforcements are equal to nine diamond reinforcements in a single block the following would be true. One chest and five pieces of obsidian all diamond reinforced would create the equivalent of a nine layer for the cost of  diamonds.. One chest and eighteen pieces of obsidian diamond block reinforced would create the equivalent of an eighteen layer vault for  diamonds.  . One chest and  obsidian diamond block reinforced would create the equivalent of a  layer vault for  diamonds. That amount of diamonds barely suffices for a sevenlayer vault.Do you see why this is broken and game destroying? As vault size increases so does the amount of diamonds needed for the next layer. Making vaults impossible to destroy is not the way to fix the problem of me being able to gather people from another server gearing them up and beating the Civcraft defense forces. All it does is make it so I could make the equivalent  layer vault for much less than it would normally cost.,Civcraft,clvvmo4,5,t5_2tm1t

2519963,0,t1_cmndjqu,How about get rid of prison pearl and replace it with a karma system? types of karma each as their own variable a number for positive and one for negative. Break protected blocks to lose positive karma. Initiate combat on others to gain negative karma unless you fight with someone who activates a mutual combat command.People who die with negative karma below a certain threshold are reborn into a purgatory. People who repeatedly gain negative karma go to lower levels of purgatory until theyre in a spartan dirt world where the mobs molest them. I call this CivRapeCage While in purgatory a player may spend positive karma to eliminate their negative karma but they are limited to spending a certain mount over a period of time to be determined.  Players may spend positive karma to neutralize the positive karma of others as a means of preventing emancipation of those who would try to buy their way back out. When one player kills another player that killed player may optionally spend positive karma to give their attacker negative karma above and beyond what they system would allot.This is the purest solution I can come up with that does not involve a pearl or pearl and fuel mechanism.

2705208,0,t1_cnb67h7,If citadel would hang a  person server for a few seconds from updating a measly  blocks of reinforcement then something is horribly Horribly wrong with the plugin. If so it should be fixed anyway regardless of this suggestion.SQL sounds like the major red flag here. Yes SQL is slow which is why you shouldnt be using SQL. It doesnt make sense here. The point of SQL is for multiple client juggling in a clientsserver situation which you dont have in civcraft plugins. Since citadel has no clientside mod all of the queries and the filling of those queries are both generated and handled serverside. Its just a simple local program not a network database scenario.Thus this should be handled with a straight up basic data collection primarily held in RAM for WAY more speed not a SQL database.Depending on how many total reinforced blocks you have you would want to do this in slightly different ways to trade speed for RAM usage. For lt reinforced blocks total I would advise simply storing the whole worlds reinforcement data entirely in RAM at all times and thus needing zero random hard disk queries ever. If optimized for space it should only need to take up a couple hundred megabytes for that many e.g. using only necessary space like a byte for y coord etc.If more than that then probably stored by chunk or some other larger region perhaps. Which requires some disk access but only once for a large section of building. Specifically only pull up that chunks reinforcement data upon the first block break event being registered in it NOT when the server simply loads it such as flying by in a minecart. Then hold it in memory for maybe a few minutes after the most recent block break to avoid wasteful disk access for people working in a small area.

Then just join a faction  some town or social group thats established enough that people will trust you and that contributes decently to the war. Once you build up raisin rep you should at least get invited to the big zergy events like this Titan thing at which point just try to make yourself useful.

2804827,0,t1_cnmw3un,gt I agree entirely with your arguments raiding is bad no matter who is doing it. If you are destroying your enemies capabilities to make war that is one thing. But you cannot do the very thing youre using to justify your whole war! Its so simple minded and just paints all the players in this clusterfuck of a conflict as asshole raiders. Oh but I wasnt the one doing the raiding it wasnt all of us! BULLSHIT. If you allow members of your party to raid you are as complicit in the raiding as if you did it. You should absolutely be held responsible. If someone is raiding and you are working with them just say Hey dude dont do that. If proof is provided that someone in your group raided kick them the fuck out. In principle I dont disagree but thats still pretty simplistic given the current circumstances. Titans vault is in dangerous hands and so it needs to be removed from the hands if its current owners. Furthermore a lot of folks dont play anymore in Titan so the vast brunt of their current population are raiders unlike with Vale for example. That doesnt mean you break innocuous builds for little reason but you are blowing this occupation out of proportion and are falling into the same moral equivalency trap I mentioned in the second last paragraph.gt You cannot claim to be the good guys when you let bad guys in your group period.What the occupying group is doing is predominantly in the best interests of small towns like yours.

2804888,0,t1_cnmwe10,I have no objection to the fighting.  Titan is in the hands of a dangerous group who represent the biggest threat to the server.  I understand entirely the reasons for attacking the city and support it wholeheartedly.  However what I do not and will never support is the raiding of the city.  I understand that historically soldiers after sieges tend to go a little ham on cities theyve taken.  However considering that this is a game theres no justification for it.  You said it yourself after the siege ends the cities tend to get leveled. It would be of the highest order hypocrisy to then take the city which was not built by raiders regardless who is currently living in it and destroying it.  Raiders have passed through my town before and done no damage.  On the other hand the blatant disregard of our sovereign laws by some members of the attacking force at Titan represent a clear and ongoing danger to my city. Their willingness to disregard laws when it suits them is to me more dangerous than any raider.  Just my two cents.  If you break peoples shit for fun or revenge youre a bad guy.,Civcraft,cnmwn18,2,t5_2tm1t

I could not edit the descriptions because it wasnt showing me thumbnails for some reason but what you will see is a large hopper loop.  Every other meter is a range of chests.  Items get delivered into the loop either manually through the item elevator you see or dropped off via SuperCart which takes HOURS to unload but whatever.  Each range is connected to a basic sorting mechanism using some repeaters and comparators.  The hopper that is stopped by the comparator has the first slot stocked with the item that is begin sorted.  All the other slots are taken up by an item that is rarely dropped off.  For my purposes I use sheared grass.  One in each of the remaining slots.  As an item is deposited the comparator will open up and let  item in.  If the range is full it keeps going down the line to the Excess and Remainders chest.  Also if a range is full a light will turn on indicating that meaning do not do any more mass deposits of that item.  The one caveat is that when getting items you must draw from the bottom chests first.  This ensures accurate accounting of the range being full.  I could have finangled it to where that wouldnt be the case but it would have cost A LOT more.  The idea was my fellow countrymen could just dump their inventories in there flip the switch and walk away.  It would eventually get dumped in there.  Anything extra got put into Manual Auxiliary Storage on the second floor which is where the SuperCart loader was.  The SuperCart loader was a retrofit as will as the full indicator lights.  I am super hung over I hope this makes sense.  ,Civcraft,cntnyvt,1,t5_2tm1t

It seems to me that youre trying to milk playing the victim to influence peoples opinion preemptively about whatever evidence Gerbic has  evidence that may very well be legitimate. Heres what youre sayinggtEVERYONE dont forget how much of a victim I am here Look at what a nice guy I am!and dont forget that Im the victim here because EVIL MRGERBIC AND HIS MEANIE CYBER BULLYING FRIENDS ARE TRYING TO SAY THAT IM ATTENTION SEEKING everyone look at me here Im not attention seeking ok? Dont forget that in the victim here so CHECK YOUR PRIVILIGE and dont believe any silly little things like objective evidence and reasonable doubt because those are MEANINGLESS BECAUSE IM THE VICTIM HERE how dare they question how much if a VICTIM I am here!!!!You know its real hard being cyber bullied on the internet even though I have all these hundreds of people here to give my lots of praise and sympathy and attention and praise and now that youre all under my guilttrip control I command you not to listen to anything that gerbice has to say about me because hes just a neckbeard manchild!!!!!This is the second post youve made about your dox. You dont get to make a second one the first was enough. Whats more Theres not much in this post that wasnt in the first post except for one thing. The dribbling selfpitying sobbing act the oh woe is me I am a man more sinned against than sinning act this isnt fucking king Lear the clichedly cynical observation about the community and the I am le quitting civcraft everybody stuff  none of that is new. All that stuff serves to mask the fact that theres actually only one purpose to this post gtIm being told I doxed myself and made death threats against myself for attention when I dont see why I would put myself up to it.Translation theyre saying I doxxed myself but i didnt You heard what they were going to say and beat them to it with this post to blunt the impact it has when they come put with it themselves.gtmrgerbic and others are sending eachother PMs with bits of my personal information to try and prove that I doxed myself and they probably amounted and created enough evidence to sow doubt. They plan to make their findings public plan to make my information public and permanent and I dont know what else I can do anymore. once again you are beating Gerbic and co to the punch to try and blunt the impact of any post which he may make.gtEvidence doesnt work out right on this server anything passes for evidence in due truth. Tomorrow I imagine everyone will hate me for something that I never did everyone will mock me for being something that Im not.Translation dont believe their reasonable evidence which will come out and implicate me soon.gtNot all of my dox was true for sure. I never acknowledged what was true and what was BS just because that would worsen it. It was better to have invalid information mixed into the truth than it was to tell people Hey my address is real but my birthday isnt. In practice fear that I would just get my dox corrected.Once again beating them to the punch  you must realise that it looks way better when you come out with it yourself than when you leave the bombdrop all to them. You know the one about you being a lying sonofabitchgtYou win. You win mrgerbic.Translation and I would have gotten away with it too of it wasnt for you meddling kidsThis whole post is just an attempt to discredit Gerbic using your overplayed snivelling victim act as leverage. Doxxing isnt even that bad. No ones died. Your life hasnt been irreparably damaged. You havent been paralyzed from the neck down. Clean your nose and man the fuck up you absolutely tiny bitchNow on to the puzzle of the original dox. It was odd that such a thorough and invasive doxx would be done on you of all people. Because youre fucking nobody. Who are you? Who could possibly gain from taking you out of the picture you who have so little influence in the server?  Who could possibly have enough of a vendetta against you who have had far too little impact on anything of importance to have upset anyone enough for this kind of a doxx. This doxx wasnt an easy flippant thing to do the doxxer didnt snatch your IP and link your Facebook account the doxx allegedly went way further than that. In fact its the biggest doxx Ive ever seen. Even bigger than serious doxxes like those found in gamergate drama and the like. Funny that there should be such a big doxx for such a little guy.Your only other claim to fame is that you shutdown Stonato but also that you gave birth to him???? and youre secretly a really old civcraft player who keeps quitting and giving away your account but then also kept on buying a new one and starting all over again as a new friend every time. Conveniently all stuff that you havent proved. Assuming this is true it suggests that youre a big guy with a job or youre a rich kid. If this is the case then why dont you act more like a big guy and whats to stop you from just giving away your account and buying a new one again? Why are you coming back again and again to whinge and cry in the subreddit?You could say that there was no reason for you to doxx yourself since its supposedly causing him more grief than gain of he did. This is wrong to say because the gain  getting lots of praise and sympathy and attention  was predictable while the grief  having people doubt him and crosscheck the info from the doxx  would have been hard to predict and to be perfectly honest youre probably not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed geohash buddy. You probably didnt see the part suspicion coming expecting only more love and attention you attention whoring fuck. All of this together  the Gerbicfocussed nature of this post your doubtfultales in your previous posts on this subreddit your annoying victimcomplex the overlyinvasive nature of the doxx for someone who has little to no presence in civcraft and the  doubt thrown as to the accuracy of said doxx  points to only one reasonable answer Youre full of shit skiddo.,Civcraft,cod6125,-21,t5_2tm1t

Its a bad environment.I had fun writing lots of awesome plugins on earlier servers when they used a simple SVN and ran their test server off of a dropbox folder for easy tweaking.

Now this is a story all about how My life got flippedturned upside down And Id like to take a minute Just sit right there Ill tell you how I became the comrade of a town called AugustaIn west Columbia born and raised On goldmayne was where I spent most of my days Chillin out maxin relaxin all cool And all crashing some markests outside of the commune When a couple of ancaps who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little coup and bodhi got scared he said Youre movin with ron paul and Sami in augustaI begged and pleaded with him day after day But he packed my minecart and sent me on my way he gave me a manifesto and then he gave me my red wool. I put my bandanna on and said I might as well kick it.First class yo this is bourgeoise Drinking P out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Augusta living like? Hmmmmm this might be alright.But wait I hear theyre prissy bourgeois all that Is this the type of place that they just send this radical cat? I dont think so Ill see when I get there I hope theyre prepared for the comrade of Augusta Well the cart landed and when I came out There was a dude in prot standing there with my name out I aint trying to get pearled yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning disappearedI whistled for a tour and when sami came near the sky it said Mount augusta and If anything I could say that this city was rare But I thought Nah forget it  Yo homes to Ataraxia!I pulled up to the commune about  or  And I yelled to sami Yo homes smell ya later I looked at my Commune I was finally there To sit in my small apartment as the comrade of mount Augusta ,Civcraft,cou28he,6,t5_2tm1t

3219306,0,t3_2wzhxe,Any more thought as to how we want to do a replacement for factory mod?Im thinking something like involving the interaction between factories being key. Pipes  Physically something like a stone wall  Allows for the flow of items and resources through pipes between factories  acts as an instant and  friction pipe between connected factories  Only allows one resource to pass  Programmatically structured as a class to represent each resource where each section of connected set of pipes can hold one resource through which things can be passed.  Each resource type may have different restrictions on its use. Maybe liquids cant flow uphill?  Special factories to allow access to the contents of connected inventories to the pipe Factories  Each factory is one or more blocks probably mostly one  Maybe a machine would be a better word  Ideally factories would be very configurable with many different options for types and behaviors but basically a factory would take some imports in the form of resources from a pipe and produce some other resources examples      Furnace           Produces heat when provided with a flammable material           Takes a great deal extra when starting or stopping      Smelter           Produces molten material from materials placed inside           Lava from stone and maybe clay dirt ect.           Molten equivalents for each classically smelted ore. Things like iron and gold      Grinder           Takes certain items and turns them into dusts.           Requires mechanical power a resource           Used as a stage in diamond coal ect processing      Filter takes dust and filters certain items out of it           Would get just the coal dust or diamond dust out of the dust produced by the grinder.           Possibly taking something like XP to magnify the amount of the target gotten      Casting           Would be able to use water to speed in the cooling           Takes molten items and turns them into their various ingots or in the case of lava smooth stone.      Reassembler            takes dust and turns it into items              Requires mechanical power dust and probably something like XP      Boiler            Would take heat and water and produce steam       Steam generator takes the steam and produces mechanical power       Factory farms             would be the most complicated to code but also probably most useful to combating lag             Ideally would be able to sense the area around it when placed and be able to determine the amount of resources it should produced based on that amount of growth surfaces and clay under them ect. As a part of this if another factory was already using a plant it would not be counted when calculating yield        Factory animal farms would be similar             Would look at the area around it. Calculate the amount of grass exposed to the sky and from that determine how much it can grow             When the chunk was loaded and a player was nearby it would simulate a representative number of animals. When killed they would be killed in the simulation.      Some balancing notes. Ideally there would be some compromises needed when creating a factory. A furnace needs to run at some rate at all times so the factory is losing resources as long as it is not in use. Piling up as many function as possible for each furnace is ideal but each furnace has a limited potential power it can produce. To work the fastest and do the most youd want to to use as many furnaces as possible to build as much as possible but that will have a cost. We may also want to investigate limiting the number of furnaces that can exist in a small area. ,Civcraft,covom14,2,t5_2tm1t
3219931,0,t1_covom14,I think we should focus on a standard but very flexible system of interactions between factories and then work on making that operate for a variety of factories themselves imagine being able to easily chain together a bunch of factories for automated outcomes.

3240902,0,t1_coxs7eq,okay...so far you have called me a self entitled cunt slimy annoyingly argumentative etcthings I have done to justify these strangely personal attacks  taken up Vitacoco and Rallag purely to spite you gone after Clone purely to spite you resemble someone IRL that you dislike open my mouthNow Im sure youll be surprised but your existence actually has very little influence over my choices. To be totally honest in my mind you were generic city dictator until pretty much this whole incident. I actually thought you were the most reasonable out of the mall cops group and the most likely to follow through with rule of law and actual justice. Really doubting my judgment now.FYI I took up the Rallag case because Papa said hey sintrahlin you like lawyertype stuff will you do a favor for a really good friend of mine and I said yes. Id also like to point out that I was actively posting on the Orion court sub several weeks in advance about how the process was too easily gamed and I thought it should be changed. Those suggestions were dismissed. I took up the Vitacoco stuff because by then America and the concept of rcivcourt had really piqued my interest. I wanted to see a functional demonstration of a case and I only had Vitas pearl to work with. I have no idea why you think that was targeted at you I didnt realize you even took personal affront to that until literally today.Seriously though most of the stuff I do is because of an interest in changing the general politics of the server.

If the producers wanted to change the price it would be very easy to.  The market for obsidian is present.  Like greg said if you want to slowly take away the idea of botting obsidian make a factory recipe for it.  For example eighteen stacks of string and eighteen stacks of stone creates nine stacks of obsidian.  That way gathering materials is still a part of obsidian creation.I know you expect backlash for a lot of changes you put in but I can only imagine the amount of posts about putting obsidian generators back in if this takes place.,Civcraft,cp4hxq2,3,t5_2tm1t

I did not however believe that the parties with whom I had entered into arbitration would heed the result or even respect the prerequisites of a peaceful solution. Clone and Itaqi were only interested in seeing another party support their side which is why I believe they picked you and refused Havok whom they did not know so well. Ive no personal qualms with you and my interactions with you in the past have been consistently pleasant. Im sorry that my friends pushed me away too especially people like Gordon. He was one of my best friends in Carson and he was the only one who put any effort into restoring the city after I asked him to come live with me. His dedication was the only thing that kept Carson alive. Ironically enough Gordon was a criminal when I first attempted to bring him with me and I pushed him to pay his reparations reform and rejoin society. I figured hed be down with anything I did for a while but I later saw that I was wrong. I mentioned a particular incident in one of my earlier responses and Ill elaborate nowI ran a bunch of the Carson bot farms  accounts minimum on a daily basis for a few months producing doublechests upon doublechests of the materials required for the Diamond Cauldron all under the pretense I would be receiving my fair share of XP based on my input. The division of XP was laid out in the CXP charter and considering Mattas passion for corporatism and contractual obligation I figured theyd hold true to it. When I approached Gordon about my share and this was before anyone knew anything of the vault break mind you he told me that my efforts had been for the Carson Defense Fund and that he had appointed himself director of said fund without any input from me or from the Carson group which is supposed to be run based upon the interests of all its members. All of my share had been through down the drain into a war that I considered a waste of time. I was furious and rightly so. Gordon would not back down insisting that he had the authority to commandeer the goods I had farmed under the umbrella of a corporation which is apparently a sham.Ive shared that account before but I dont think that youve heard it. Ill reiterate I did not backstab anyone. I cannot backstab someone who doesnt feel close to me in the first place.,Civcraft,cp869p6,2,t5_2tm1t

The downside to this is that pigmen farms would then kill pretty much only by mustercull and ttk isnt really a fan of that method.  Though this is definitely one of the better ways of getting pigmen to not pile up.There may be a need to make it so that if a nonobby block with open air above it cant be found within so many blocks from the portal that the spawn event is canceled though.  Im not sure what this limit should be but it shouldnt be hard to look at the current portal farm designs and work it out.  We only need this since you dont want pigmen being shot under a portal farm and into a cave or something.

3578598,0,t1_cpuldox,I have checked for the Ghast Tears and Beacon you claim we stole and they are not in any of our chests nor on Matt himself considering hes trapped in a pearl in MA. I led you to our base showed you our vault proved to you we had stolen nothing and you then threatened me with a pearl unless I gave you free access to every single one of our chests. You said that was sufficient. Please stop lying and carrying on old arguments which have been sorted in order to squeeze us of the valuables you have already taken from us. If you have any actual physical proof it was us that stole these things from you I suggest you show it because right now youre using lies for your own personal gain and it is ruining the game for both me and Matt.Edit Scratch that! That was a guy called Fedex or something. We have no idea who Dhingus is or where Aetolia is. Hes quite clearly lying and cannot provide any proof.

Everyone hates clone because hes as close to a oneman justice system as is possible on the server and that has fundamental problems and replacing all justice with Sintralin and PapaPound is literally the worst possible way to try to improve the justice system on the server. You could not come up with a worse solution that still makes any sense to anyone.ShadedJons UN is an attempt at a somewhat democratic and fair justice system and one of his stated goals is to provide an alternative to dealing with certain other players. I have a lot of digging in my future but SerQwaez and I will also be constructing a megavault and a justice system built along very similar lines.

3979879,0,t3_361woh,gt it could be interesting if compacted items where only allowed in donkey chests to make a proper merchent setup rather than just allowing any individual to carry compacted items as normal. I am not sure that I find this very exciting in the sense that so many paths and tunnels just arent donkeyfriendly not to say anything of the Nether passage. It seems like a bit of a logistical nightmare. Rather the idea of requiring a decompactor factory with a nontrivial cost to set up and possibly operate could help make this mode of transport reasonable while restricting it to donkeys could be stifling to some for reasons of infrastructure that cannot easily be modified.Also if you want to encourage trade then encourage it rather than finding more ways to insert roadblocks to limit it. Id love to first see what happens for a bit after this is implemented before coming in with the nerfs.

But still also participate in world policing now and then. And various other people associated for that wrong reason.But since world policing is still the most widely shared characteristic of the people who are actually the problem it still does not get replaced by a better term even though it brings collateral damage.Perhaps some clever PR guru could come up with a more surgically precise descriptive label but I suspect its too late now.,Civcraft,crtxqs7,1,t5_2tm1t

On top of that they were on their way out of Mir when attacked many of them just standing there as they were pearled. Chanada has every right to protest this thievery.  months is not really months on end. Its more like  months.

Hell you literally settled within the claims of an existing Chanadian entity you didnt even settle in some random part. Dont act like you have turned the area into a wonderland because although you have a pretty build you have inhibited Chanada from creating another nether factory which was on the books and have brought some distasteful characters with you who wave swords instead of engage in proper discussion or hold consideration to all parties involved.

4948654,0,t1_cuhkoke,I would say this is true. The formation of the NEA was initially spurred with a couple things in mind. At the time Iria and the Corum region had fallen prey to constant raiding and knocked into inactivity. This was rooted to the fact that the Corum region used to be considered helplessly far out as there lacked players competent in PvP locally and transportation infrastructure to receive more immediate response to threats. Fellowships attempt at revitalising the activity of the region eventually led to the formation of the NEA whos founding goals were to improve regionally security develop our own transportation infrastructure and help vitalize states facing the threat of inactivity. Note that at the time the CIC passed through Aurora and Bryn only within the quadrant and was later controversially within the quadrant rerouted to exclude Bryn and aside from that rail connections either did not exist or consisted of many private lines.,Civcraft,cuibgn2,1,t5_2tm1t

5336425,0,t3_3o2cnz,the single most important conflict in the history of civcraft is probably the Cuban War of Independencelong ago a small but beautiful nation began to form across the river just east of Orion. This nation was named Cuba and was inhabited by peaceloving wellnatured citizens who just loved to build and wanted to be left alone.Cuba anounced its existence and was greeted with respect by the international community but the capitalist pig dogs of Orion had nothing but animosity for this young nation. The Orionites claimed the land belonged to them and that the Cubans were NOT a sovereign nation. This hatred of their new neighbors caused Orion to lay siege on Cuban infrastructure and embargo all trade to the growing nation.Humanitarian aid was received from around the civcraft world and even airdrops of wheat were sent in protest of the capitalists horrendous actions.Finally the harassment led to grief. The Cubans who are communist in nature believed that workbenches were a sign of capitalist oppression and had banned all nonpartyapproved workbenches from existing within the walls of Cuba. One morning when the humble workers woke to the rising sun they discovered that they had been attacked. hundreds of reinforced work benches were dropped within Cuba and WAR WAS DECLAREDCuba declared war and asked for a civilized set of rules to be used in order to ensure no heinous war crimes could be committed by either sideIron armor no enchants onlyHealth pots onlyStone swordsUnenchanted bowsCuba sought the help of the international community in fighting for their freedoms and rights against the oppression of the Orion horde across the river and tens of tens of fighters came from across the globe in support.As the date of the war got closer and closer small skirmishes too place on the borders of Cuba and Orion Events such as sniper fire did not deter the glorious defenders of Cubas freedom.International discussion ensued over the ethical decisions of creating rules of engagement but when war finally came all parties agreed to play by the rules.On a sunny Saturday morning WAR WAS WAGED Fighters from across the world reinforced the ranks of both Cuba and Orion in a massive v battle to the death. The Orionites led by ukwizzle uitaqi ustormsweeper and umalice attacked from the east trying to create a twofront war but Cuba held the line. After a long hard battle at the very gates of Eastern Cuba a massive explosion could be heard. An Orion Sapper had planted a large bomb near the Cuban military base to the North. Panic ensued as Cuban fighters attempted to retreat to the base and stall the sneak attack that had begin in the North. The battle within the military base saw the deaths of many good soldiers on both sides and Cuba made the decision to fall back to the relative safety of the South. Aeonite soldiers led by the great udsclouse and lieutenant uSiksta held their embassy as the leader of the Cuban army Farley led a group of Cuban soldiers across the river and into the very capital of Orion to take down their flag. uToastedspikes led the magnificent Royal Loveshackian Army right back into the fray of the battle and fought back the Orion forces laying Siege to the Aeon Embassy. Farley and the remaining members of the Cuban army joined shortly after and the battle at the Aeon embassy lasted for another  minutes. Cuban forces held the embassy for as long as they could while they fell one by one to bow shots and constant attack. Finally Farley fell in combat on the roof of the embassy and a cease fire was called.The Cubans defeated and the nation in ruin Farley made his goodbye post and fell into obscurity. God bless the men and women that fought for our freedoms that day. Never forget the good you have done. RIP,Civcraft,cvtsd3c,6,t5_2tm1t

By the time CT has worn off youve regained enough health  in many cases full health  that it no longer makes sense to reward the pearl to the last person who hit you .Perhaps a better middle ground would be to lengthen CT time  seconds. In any case allowing CT to control some edge cases but not others causes a very confusing very broken mechanic that players cant anticipate yet CAN weaponize.Hopefully this evens the playing field and clears expectations for combatants across the board.,Civcraft,cwy1v0e,1,t5_2tm1t

6401954,0,t3_43crur,I like the gist of your ideas. The only thing that sounds unbalanced is the method youre proposing to allow players to free themselves. If players are able to free themselves it should be harder than just farming pearls. Maybe farming pearls could be an element of it. Also as an alternate solution to the transfer of groups there could be a factorymade block thats required to create a group. Ill call it a GroupBlock but it could be called whatever. To make a group you would place a GroupBlock and the group you created would then be bound to that GroupBlock. You can bind multiple groups to a single GroupBlock. You would be the owner of the group however if somebody else picked up the GroupBlock they would be able to take control of whatever group was bound to the GroupBlock.,Civcraft,czhc5w7,3,t5_2tm1t

6404375,0,t1_czhj5wc,The tower is way too big and provides little to no defensive utility. Also the design of the bunker at the base where you teleport up could just as easily be a minecart behind a door providing less cover for attackers and easier access. The bunker down there is pretty pointless. To elaborate about the tower it extends way too far over the rings offers no position for defenders to actually do anything and really only serves as a bunker to regear. This is fine but it doesnt need to be as big as it is. Also the redstone behind that teleporter trap is wayyyyyy more complex than it needs to be.

And while that alone wouldnt make me not want to have him as an dev it makes me a little shaky to have him as a mumble moderator and a subreddit moderator.  Asides from that I know you guys clearly trust him and he does good dev work without a doubt.  But I just dont see how that gives him the qualifications to run the subreddit impartially.  Sure he removes and approves posts without bias but you guys arent keeping total tabs on his communications.  He could be discussing information you wouldnt want discussed or that those who had posted things on the subreddit wouldnt want talked about.  I know its the same as back in the day with Matta when I protest him and bagi working on dev stuff.

8576304,0,t3_4x9o76,Hey Civcraft! First off thanks for watching and participating in the first ANN broadcast! This sort of videobased news show is something Ive always wanted to do in Civcraft but never found the skills or motivation to make it a reality until now. I think this sort of news broadcast has certain advantages that the normal radio show cant implement such as the integration of footage photos and screenshots into the announcing. Not to mention that if ANN ever implements commercials we expect to see some very funny videos. This first weekly report was largely a proof of concept and a way to iron out thet gritty details and we also have tried to keep it relatively local at first in order to ensure that we can slowly scale up as we learn the necesary lessons. Youll also probably notice the concentration on Auroran news. While we will continue to broadcast Auroraspecific news we want to go more indepth with our local neighbors. If you live in Concordia Iria Aquila or one of the other multitude of nations in Tjikko or Naunet please consider contacting us about serving as a local correspondent and getting your countrys news out there! We would ask for your help both in identifying local stories and writing the script for that section of the show. Even if you dont want to be a full time correspondent we would welcome story submissions!Finally I want to thank uZolagiaGeek IGN greatmario for all of his assistance in making this vision come to life. He provided the camera video and audio editing skills that made a vague idea in my head turn into the reality we have today.EDIT Also credit goes to uroosterrroo for his appearance in the blooper at the end.,Civcraft,d6dmdch,8,t5_2tm1t

There is no reason to use any armor other than diamond currently none.Even the repair issue due to diamonds large durability you dont have to repair it quite so often ... whereas gold with its pitiful durability will break after one fight.Factories also WILL NOT enchant any armor but diamond.These factors all play against using anything other than diamond.,Civcraft,d7sazvc,2,t5_2tm1t

9132069,0,t3_55d4w5,The syriaesque event of the IntIS rebellion. The HKE and the newly independent regime in Istanbul were feuding in a kind of cold war Gensokyo part of the HKE couldnt touch us due to a guarantee by Mt. Augusta and we couldnt touch them due to us being a new state without the military capacity to do anything.When the channer invasion happened there was a soft coup in the government of Viridian the main channer city and the ABR took over a coalition of HKE and Gensokyo players KovioCrew. This made Viridian and most of the channers allied to the HKE and the mass population of the channers was a worry to us redditors in the Islamic Sultanate of Istanbul.Therefore when I went to Viridian as an Orionite diplomat my parallel account was still part of the diplomatic corps of Orion I also secretly made a trip to Intis an islamic neighborhood of Viridian that was undergoing crackdowns by the ABR government. I met up with a contact but at the last minute my cover was blown and this resulted in me being chased down by an angry mob when I returned to viridian screaming Foreigners out! Redditors out!. They eventually cornered me and killed me further souring relations with not only Istanbul but also our ally at the time Orion.After contact was made with the neighborhood elders in IntIS an Istanbulite diplomatic mission began supported by Orion to infiltrate IntIS and bring with us prot swords and potions to ferment a possible rebellion. We received a hundred or so screenshots and maps of the city from IntIS locals as well as intel passed on to us by Orionite agents. We were convinced that by causing IntIS to rebel and split off wed gain a valuable ally in the region or even encourage regime change within Viridian itself.Right as we were finalizing the weapons transfers logistics handled by deeplevel Orion agents who even I didnt know the playernames of a public execution of an IntIS elder by ABR security forces instigated an early uprising in the neighborhood. Somehow IntIS locals armed with makeshift weapons managed to seize Viridians wealth vault and pillaged it making off with stacks of diamond blocks in an undisclosed location somewhere outside IntIS. The ABR broke the story to the subreddit as a terrorist attack rather than a struggle for independence. This coupled with reports of IntIS revolutionaries killing Viridian civilians caused Orion to quietly drop out of the deal leaving the weapons and armour in a fortified cave in the wilderness north of Viridian.With our main ally out of the picture and facing a terrible PR hit the entire server seemed to have rallied behind the ABR government in condemning the terrorist attacks Istanbulite militias moved to the drop zone for the weapons took everything in the crates and left the area as fast as possible. Simultaneously our names had been dropped by captured IntIs members who claimed Istanbulite forces were sitting outside the city and that they would move in and liberate IntIS any hour. Diplomatic channels failed to be opened between the ABR and Istanbul and so the story broke publicly. In panic mode Istanbul officially denied the allegations and tried to downplay their involvement. In the face of massive public outrage and trashing of Istanbuls reputation we even agreed to supply the ABR with information about the intIS elders involved to save our own skin.The outcome? IntIS was reclaimed by the ABR lowlevel revolutionaries executed and pearled the elders were imprisoned and then exiled to the other side of the map where they eventually created Beneshire and the IntIS independence struggle was snipped in the bud. It began the downwards trend of the previously rosy relationship between Istanbul and Orion and created a lasting hatred between former IntIS members and many Viridian citizens who viewed our meddling as having destroyed their neighborhood and city. In the greater scheme of the IstanbulHKE cold war it galvanized the Gensokyo government to pursue covert proxy war operations of their own eventually culminating in the Samarra Crisis.,Civcraft,d89k07o,12,t5_2tm1t
