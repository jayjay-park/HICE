388066,0,t1_cfkyrn4,Yeah it looks pretty sweet. But cats are vicious killers. They are reputed to have extincted thousands of species. I dont know if Im down with all that killing and bloodshed. My cats also enjoy torturing their rodent victims so they are morally depraved at best. But that is just my big brain take on the issue. As a cat I probably would not have any internal ethical conflicts so it would be all good I suppose. However I would always eat the apple of the tree of knowledge even if it results in some sadness and sorrow due to that intelligence.,Existentialism,cfkzlql,-2,t5_2ql4m

I look at it this way. What does a word mean? Look up its definition. The definition of the word is the meaning of the word. Applying this to a person what defines you as a person? That is an absurd question that cant be asked. No person has an it or thing that defines them that captures all that they are. Persons do not have meaning.,Existentialism,cgffas2,1,t5_2ql4m
705029,0,t1_cgk6q2w,I would also like to add that Nietzsches Eternal Recurrence has an Amor Fati attitude towards it that no matter what horrors you face you simply love life and accept what you go through. A love for fate. Of what I remember Nietzsches world mainly consist of being in isolation so that the Overman shall grow enough strength and overcome his mountain his obstacles. Lots of allusions and earthly elements. However come to think of it I dont really recall much existential despair or angst reading it cant remember my impression of Thus Spoke Zarathustra after reading it.Nietzsche makes great emphasis of becoming who you are and making your own values.

803803,0,t1_cgvm6az,Thats nihilism youre thinking of existential philosophy argues that you can make your own subjective meaning but people can ask the existential question themselves in which case they may derive for themselves a belief in an objective meaning.The reason I stress the word belief is that its not really belief rather they have certainty and conviction... However this is only for a very small minority of people who seriously think there are others who say they know the truth when they have no understanding of what the truth even is. ,Existentialism,cgvn9el,3,t5_2ql4m
887320,0,t3_24a6wm,Existentialism can often get you caught up on the fact that you die. But I do not fear death.I believe that when your body senses neardeath Dimethyltryptamine floods your serotonin receptors and takes your consciousness from your physical body to another plane of existence. You know how when you dream for  minutes and it feels like an hour? Thats just a small amount of DMT that puts your brain into REM sleepdreammode. Now imagine that all at once as an evolutionary trigger that saves your consciousness from being lost and puts you in your own personal heaven or basically just a nearinfinite dream.Yes this is a pseudoscience still in some ways but thats because most world governments have made it one of the most illegal substances to own. Keep in mind its in everything every blade of grass every animals brain everything. And yet they keep it illegal and researchers have a tough time making progress with learning its importance to human consciousness. But research has been done. Check out Im not really sure what happens if you get shot in the head but yeah. Thats what I think of death and thats why I stopped fucking with myself by questioning the philosophy of lifes worth in relation to death. Life and death are one in the same.

1476754,0,t3_2b27jx,Im personally against having children since by the time someone is old enough to understand existential angst is life meaningful or meaningless? theyve probably already established emotional connections with their community family etc. In giving birth life meaningful or meaningless is thrust upon the child without any input from the child him or herself.Of course this is probably only a small consideration.

1530714,0,t1_cj7iqwi,I have read all  comments up until this point and I am going to try and continue with the idea of losing your attachments. I am going in a very different direction then req is. You have an attachment to what you perceive are logical antonym of emotion hate and love they have no logical connection due to their perceived polarity they are emotions that we feel. They are not the outside edges of lives meaning they are not inherently important to life as you think they are.       Part of losing your attachments is understands that your emotions are just part of biologyhumanity. Love has an evolutionary reason to exist the feeling of love might has probaly increase the number of pregnancies it creates a bond between the parents and a child with  parents has a better chance at survival. Love isnt a reason to live it is part of the reason why you are alive in the first place and I dont think that you can then use love as reason to live. You can use the feeling of love to increase your happiness in your life but I dont see how it can be a reason to live? Hate has an evolutionary reason to exist as well quite simple it motivates people. Most often hate is driven by envy. Imagine the world before the modern society that we have now where stealing and murder and against socially enforced laws. If you were envious of someone elses property or spouse you could just simply kill them and take their property and spouse. Evolutionary in the past hate has been a richly rewarded emotion. Hate and envy can now be suppressed by obtaining status symbols ie money fame houses cars and women. When you have what everyone else wants you are no longer envious of those who do not have what you have but someone will always have something that you want. If we all had the means to become rich and famous we would because we are evolutionarily programed to do so.           ,Existentialism,cj85h7w,2,t5_2ql4m

1771379,0,t3_2ee7da,The act of running encapsulates within itself multiple means toward what Sartre or was it Heidegger? would call surpassing oneself. There is the surpassing in the sense of getting faster. There is also the spiritual surpassing which you describe. I think you have a decent approach when you isolate running as a path toward surpassing. Oprah once said something like Running is the best metaphor for life because you get out of it what you put into it. While that is debatable I hold that running is a perfectly fine way to attempt to achieve surpassing.,Existentialism,ck2frvp,1,t5_2ql4m

3050363,0,t3_2v2vyg,gt I mean Schopenhauer is the angular stone of all existensialism and most  literature.This simply isnt the case. While Schopenhauer is an important figure in the history of philosophy and more particularly in th German Philosophy he is not the angular stone of all existentialism. The big figures in late th th century German philosophy are Kant Fichte Herder Schiller Schegel Kierkegaard Schopenhauer Nietzsche and Marx though Im sure some will disagree with me and also wish to add more. As my list tries to make clear there are a large number of philosophers other than Schopenhauer who have a much larger influence on the history of philosophy and their particular time period. Moreover the historical roots of Existentialism can be traced through Kant though Kant is by NO MEANS an existentialist and  in its earliest articulation in Kierkegaard. Some like to put Nietzsche as another founding philosopher of existentialism but of all the Nietzsche Ive read I would limit him to an influence not an existentialist. ,Existentialism,coe62o1,3,t5_2ql4m

We seek to maximize and sustain happiness as much as possible so sometimes its better to defer gratification in the short term to maximize it in the long run but the experience itself remains intrinsically valuable no matter what you choose to do to attain it. When looking at it in existentialist terms its best to look outside the context of the individual experience so that we can maximize the overall happiness in our lives.

9740814,0,t3_5e9yfu,I think those two do not necessarily exclude each other. As to your question in a way you could say it doesnt matter what is true but only what you want to be true or what you subjectively percieve to be true. I do not want to live in a nihilistic world nore do I subjectively feel that life is meaningless.By saying I am an existentialist you could say that in a way I am already amitting that Im living in a meaningless world but I prioritize my subjective feeling over objective persuasion. I think that you could even say that existentialism is an optimal compromise between objective assessment and cherishing subjective experience. I do not seek to deny reality well ideally because I have already realized for myself that you cant percieve neutrally you always interpret what you percieve and that my subjective perception is more important than my objective knowledge.That way I am less afraid to come closest to recognizing reality as far as I am capable of in the terms of constructivism because I have freed myself from having to rationalize my experience.Well I tried to articulate myself understandably.

10310365,0,t1_dc2ai43,Whether you want to know it or not the authors writings are the product of every single event leading up to that point in life and to hear the same views espoused by French existential midcentury white male philosophers  while enlightening perhaps  can get pretty stale. Overriding the central concept of existentialism? No...you mean a single statement by one man who rejected many of the ideas espoused in the work you are citing. Also Whk cares about Whk or what the author is? has to be one of the the most ignorant things you say about an author no offense. Context is abolutely necessary and the key to understanding a certain work isnt just blindly accepting their rhetoric but understanding where the author comes from. Matter of fact I would recommend that you read Simone de Beauvoirs the wife of Jean Paul Sartre The Second Sex maybe so you can read a work for reasons other than the face value of each word.

10772865,0,t1_ddqzqz4,Okay long postIm a little rusty on this but I think there are a few different ways the word nihilism is used. I looked it up and it appears there actually were some thinkers back in the day calling themselves nihilists but generally it is just the mood or thought of meaninglessness that was arising for a variety of reasons in the twentieth century.While existentialist philosophers each tried their hand at solving it I dont think existentialism as a philosophy is defined by that quest so much as its defined by its way of going about it. While other philosophers either brush nihilism off or try to argue against it some other way existentialists were unique in their willingness to grant it a certain amount of credibility conceding that much of western philosophy is in fact baseless. I think I agree with that aspect of existentialism more than I agree with any particular existentialist philosophers conclusions. I mean its still very much a work in progress. ,Existentialism,ddr554m,1,t5_2ql4m

10894803,0,t1_de3ou10,Im not saying the essence of experience is global but that consciousness or that bit of consciousness that isnt related to the brain is global and our consciousness is stapled down to this particular perspective.  This is a possibility only negated by a strict materialism which I see in a sense as incommensurable with this position Im describing from the materialist perspective but not arguably from the one Im describing which can be understood as a type of dualism given the material influence of the brain on conscious experience working interdependently with a nonphysical psychic not in the stupid sense stuff which is shared by everyone in terms of constituting consciousness.Meaning the self is a sort of an intersection between two domains that of the physical world and the spiritual world like a point as an intersection of two axes.  Ive read your previous post seriously so if you think Im missing anything in just arguing for my position against yours here let me know and Ill be happy to address it.Regarding Nietzsche this is from The Gay Science aphorism gtCause and effect there is probably never such a duality in truth a continuum faces us from which we isolate a few pieces just as we always perceive a movement only as isolated pointsi.e. do not really see but infer. The suddenness with which many effects stand out misleads us it is a suddenness only for us. There is an infinite number of processes that elude us in this second of suddenness. An intellect that saw cause and effect as a continuum not as we do as arbitrary division and dismemberment  that saw the stream of the event  would reject the concept of cause and effect and deny all determinedness. He appeals to flux in a few other places.  And I think the next step here is that if all is flux and as Hume said causality is projected onto the world of our experiences through what he called custom then were left with another type of global interrconnected reality of which our consciousness is just an illusory part.  ,Existentialism,de3pzky,1,t5_2ql4m
