In my case it wasnt worth it I calculated how much it would cost with and without it using hyperdia and I will be saving  by not using it. So make sure to calculate. Personally I rented rooms with Airbnb locals set a room that you can rent to use during your trip so I will be living with locals that way. Its cheaper than a hotel room the ones I took ranged from  to  a night. As for the rest K is waaaaaaaay more than enough especially after planehotel.

Hakone is where the hot springs are and youll see Fuji from a distance.  Its a nice backdrop though..

The answer in almost every instance is a solid no.There are very few JR trains in Tokyo and most private rail trips are only a few dollars. Get a SUICA or PASMO prepaid card load it up wiht  or so and reload as needed. You can return the card and get a refund before you leave.The only instance where JR pass makes sense is if youre going to be leaving Tokyo on for several fairly long Shinkansen trips.

1945210,0,t3_2gpw2v,If possible i think your best option is to use your ATM card. Cash is a bit hard and stressful to carry around not to mention the fees usually added on top of changing cash unless you hunt out a good deal. Whereas mastercardvisa debit cards usually get close to the interbank rate.There may be both fees charged by your bank either a flat fee a percentage or both and fees charged by the ATM operator. However here in Australia at least several banks especially new players on the scene are willing to waive those charges to get your business a noted example here is Citibank which is relatively new to Down Under. If you can find a deal like that i think ATM cards might be your best option. Its much less easier than cashing and carrying travelers checks. In the event of theft its probably easier to sort out cards as well. That said if i couldnt convince you yes banks will cash them. They are probably a marginally better option than cash in terms of exchange rate and safety. ,JapanTravel,cknlkru,1,t5_2uylr

1957820,0,t1_ckp42ps,There are roughly a dozen railroad companies operating within the greater Tokyo area.  The most effective way of getting around in Tokyo is to use a combination of the JR and subways which would give you pretty much full coverage.  You can get one of a multitude of day passes but train fares tend to be very cheap .. or so per ride depending on the company and the distance some lines are a bit more expensive. like if you want to go to Odaiba so unless you spend a lot of time hopping from place to place youd be better off just paying as you go.To that end I would suggest you get either a Suica or a Pasmo card same thing just issued by different companies.  These are chargeable IC cards that you can charge with whatever amount you like and the automatic gates will deduct the fare from the card.  You need a  yen deposit to make the card which they return to you with the unused balance when you return it.  On top of that you can use the same card in other major cities but not I believe the Kyoto bus system.  Load it up with about  yen and just pay as you go.  Easy as pie.,JapanTravel,ckp4brm,2,t5_2uylr

There are usually escalators but when its crowded a lot of people just take the stairs instead of cramming onto a narrow elevator. That would be my best advice.Its possible to have big luggage but its definitely more of a hassle. Its easier to bring it along with you on the long haul trains the shinkansen but on local trains its just a matter of taking up as little room as possible. People arent going to kick you off or anything though. I saw several people with big luggage on local trains during my trip to Japan and they seemed to manage.Also if possible avoid the early morning and evening rush hours when taking local trains the times when people are heading to work and heading back home from work. These hours are when the trains are completely packed. In the middle of the day i.e. late morning to the afternoon there is usually a lot more breathing room on the trains.,JapanTravel,cobcfoh,1,t5_2uylr

Which means you could travel to Osaka from Tokyo step outside the station for an hour and travel on to Hiroshima on a single day. Dont know what you mean with it only counts as one day of travel...I do hope that you wont do daytrips to Kyoto that would be kinda a waste since it will take you around  hours roundtrip.

3382432,0,t3_2ywtk6,Hey buddy  you sound like me a few months ago.  Dont worry  lots of good resources in here.  First I strongly recommend you read the Travel Recommendations Mega Thread and the FAQ  theyll give you a ton of detailed information on everything youll need to know.  Beyond that you need to begin thinking about the type of stuff youd like to do  want to hit museums?  Parks?  Baseball?  Sumo?  Walking around?  Do you want to do multiple cities?  How much time will you actually have on the ground.  You mention spending  days in Tokyo  the city is enormous and has a lot to offer I was just there with my wife for  days and we barely scratched the surface.  As far as food goes there are a number of threads with recommendations on places to eat but honestly you could go wandering in just about any direction and find something awesome that wont break the bank.  Happy to go into more detail but I think you should do a bit of reading and then come back with a few more specific questions.  Hope this helps!,JapanTravel,cpdtn5m,1,t5_2uylr

3491321,0,t3_308wio,The most important thing for a short stay in Japan is to see the stuff you really want to see especially in Tokyo.Kyoto you should get a list of the top temples and pick  that you really are interested in. They really are amazing.Tokyo is so big that you cant see it all. Find a list of stuff to do in Tokyo and then circle only the stuff that seems interesting to you.For example if you are really into anime then spend time in Akihabara and try to find some anime events to go to.If you interested in nightlife there is a ton of clubs and bars all over Tokyo. If you are really into shopping then make sure you spend a lot of time in Shibuya and Ginza. For Sumo you are pretty lucky. There is a tournament starting on May  and ending on May  in Tokyo so you have a few days to get to a match but I wouldnt wait until May  the last day is usually sold out.

Atom is a pretty big club and I really doubt a staff member there drugged you. Possibly yakuza at the club? Were you at a hotel or in a shady room? If you were in a shady room sounds like you walked in to a massage parlor and you most likely didnt have sex especially in the state that you were in. They dont need to have sex if you were that incoherent. Also if you pulled out money at the ATM you maybe shit out of luck since you withdrew the money yourself. Do you have a receipt or copy of the bank statement that says otherwise? You might get the money back on your card though. The  exact suggests you were in a fuzoku massage parlor establishment that determines price based on how drunk you are though.

Accounting for checkout getting to the train station riding your train getting to your accomodation and checking in most of these moves will take you about  hours each time. Thats about  hours of your waking time or little more than a whole day spent just moving between cities. You should probably remove one or two places from your list.If you insist in doing so you should try to do the following Use luggage forwarding and take a backpack with a single clothing change for your Nagano Koyasan and Nagoya stays so you dont have to carry around your main piece of luggage. If you can check out late leave your luggage in station lockers upon arrival and explore right away since main stations are usually in the city center or close to it. Move in the afternoon  evening once the sun is down. Museums temples and other historical landmarks close early so you need to make the most out of your day.As for the length of your stays Ive been in most of these places Havent been to Nagano or Nagoya tough! and it seems adequate.

You may also wish to carry evidence of at least a few thousand dollars of available money to prove you can survive in Japan during that time. A recent bank statement printout is fine. If you overstay you will get caught as you try to leave because Japan is one of the few nations that actually checks your paperwork on exit rather than only on entry. And yes youll be banned from reentry for a multiyear period the length of which is at the discretion of the officer.Note that you can probably have TWO day periods per year however so you can always leave and come back in a week or two which usually works fine though they may try harder to make sure youre not planning to stay the second time.

Total together thats  yen or  AUD if the traveler takes the Keisei route from Narita to Tokyo.So its a difference of  AUD which will easily add up as the traveler takes multiple trips in the city.

Resist the urge to spend until youve gotten a few daysweeks worth of price data!Ive flown from the US both times to Tokyo. First time I flew was from a smaller noninternational airport. I purchased the tickets in NovemberDecember  to visit Tokyo in March  ironically just a week after the awful earthquake and tsunami. That cost me about  which I thought was a pretty good price. I believe the airline was Delta.In  I purchased tickets in March to fly in late September. I was flying into Narita from Logan Airport Boston and the price was . Cathay Airlines. It was a red eye flight but the price made it worth it. Everyone Ive talked to is astounded by the price so Id say  would be a killer good price in USD so in pounds itd be ?.Based on that likely flying from international to international is the best way to get a better price.,JapanTravel,cwzoiss,2,t5_2uylr

Arrive at the airport two hours before the flight  but how long youll take to get there depends on where youre staying. Something like  minutes for most of Tokyo I assume. How big are the bags?

Best option with a JR Pass is Shinkansen from Tokyo to Nagano which is fully covered.      Then either pay for the trainsbus or buy one of the local passes from Nagaden Railway.      For heading to Osaka just go back to Nagano Station from Yudanaka as per above and then you can use your JR Pass all the way to Osaka.  Use Hyperdia to work out the best route but it will either be via Ltd Exp Shinano to Nagoya then Hikari Shinkansen to ShinOsaka or sometimes Hokuriku Shinkansen from Nagano to Kanazawa and then Ltd Exp Thunderbird to Osaka.  ,JapanTravel,d1kx9tk,1,t5_2uylr

If it does have a visa or master card logo then it can pull money out of ATMs and be used to pay for things at merchants like a credit card would be.

7477153,0,t3_4ht1kz,The Japan Rail Pass only covers JR Trains and Ferries of which there is only one. This includes the Shinkansen high speed train  but does not include the faster Shinkansen lines. Any other train you will encounter during your trip that is not a JR train will be via a private line. A lot of tourists will claim you can get around Tokyo just fine with the Japan Rail Pass  but honestly its inconvenient to rely solely on JR especially if youre trying to get the the middle or the southsouthwestern areas of Tokyo. The easiest thing to do for the times when you wont be on a JR train ie Tokyo Metro Keio Odayku etc. is to get a SuicaPassmo card from any train station and load it with . You can also use the IC card across Japan on buses and other train lines. Im pretty sure the buses in Kyoto how most people get around use IC cards. Otherwise youll be paying for a ticket every time you get off a JR line. Much easier to have the card tap and go.

Youll have to cook for yourself or go out to eat great restaurant just around the corner so ask the staff for directions but its much cheaper than a ryokan so you can splurge on other things.Its located in Ito which is southwest of Tokyo and free to access with the Japan Rail Pass.

It is highly unlikely anyone will hire you on a tourist visa the  day one and if it do it will be totally illegal and not recommended at all.So sure you can go for  months but you wont be able to work so make sure you have enough money to last that long. It will be expensive even if you do everything on the cheap. So make sure youre prepared. ,JapanTravel,d3fgjef,3,t5_2uylr

Note English page says from midday but Im guessing thats outdated info.I did also find below with Day Course with checkin from am BUT best to check with the hotel first since its a  information.

You would spend way too much time sitting on a train and checking into and out of hotels and not enough time actually experiencing Japan. Even if you push your trip to ten days thats still pretty tight. I would suggest sticking to the Kansai region for the first part of your trip then head up to Tokyo for your last two days.If you really want to see a lot of Japan you could fly into Fukuoka and experience Kyushu for a day or two before heading to KobeOsakaKyotowhatever else you want to do in the Kansai region.,JapanTravel,d5mruss,2,t5_2uylr

8493140,0,t3_4vzx4d,ultimately you have to figure out your itinerary and then see how many shinkansen rides youll be taking. those trips are what makes the jr pass worth while.when i went a few months ago i ended up getting the  week pass and it was VERY worth it for us. during the  weeks for shinkansen trips we did. narita airpot to osaka. osaka to nagoya round trip to see a concert. osaka to tokyo. tokyo to kyoto. kyoto to tokyo round trip we went to tokyo for a day because we couldnt get final fantasy cafe reservations while we were staying there so we got tickets and did a day trip. kyoto to osaka round trip it was near the end of our trip and we REALLY wanted to go to kuma kafe one last time before going home. kyoto to tokyo. tokyo to narita airportand on top of that we got a lot of use out of the local coverage as well. that being said the fact that we made use of the jr pass so heavily is definitely the exception and not the rule. our schedule was a little bit jumbled read as not efficient because we had plans to see concerts and wrestling at various places on specific days. normally people would use the shinkansen A LOT less than we did.basically you need to plan  your itinerary and look at the long trips you have planned and then price check them and see if the cost ends up being more or less than the cost of a jr pass.also keep in mind that at least in osaka and nagoya and probably a lot of other subway systems you can purchase an unlimited use  day pass. we found that very useful.on more thing to keep in mind about the trains you scan your cardpaper ticket both when you enter the system AND when you leave. its not like that where im from so i was wondering around looking for an exit until i realized that we walked by a ton and we just had to swipe out.,JapanTravel,d636wvw,3,t5_2uylr

Tokyo to Mitake Station  m by train then bus to the Takimoto cable car station  m then cable car partway up and walk the rest of the way up to Mt Mitake  m.  If youre at least mildly fit you can walk on to Mt Odake  m Mt Nokogiri  m and then down to Okutama Station  m and catch a train back to Tokyo.  Prefer to do it on a weekday avoid the crowds. The bus stop is just near the train station easy to find or just follow the other hikers. Use your PASMO on the train bus and the cable car. Convenient!

8696654,0,t3_4z447l,. Yes. Smaller shops may or may not take cards so its best to always carry some cash. Larger stores especially chain stores will almost definitely take cards.. Most foreign cards work without issues. One card type that often has issues is Maestro.. Should be fine. It really depends how much you like to spend while on holiday and what you plan to do.. This will depend on what your card company charges you for withdrawals. I take a card that I load foreign currency on so I dont get charged a conversion fee at the ATM and doesnt charge me for withdrawals or for use in stores. Check your card details.. Ive heard airports in Japan do good rates but I have no experience with this myself as I tend to change it in my home city before I leave theres a local changer that does great rates.Note For foreign cards youll want to use ATMs in s and post offices.

Just show your pass on the way out and they wont even blink an eye.For shinkansen you can catch either reserved or unreserved. If you take unreserved I believe but am not  sure you can just get on or off as youd wish.If you take a reserved spot you can probably do the same but its a kind of a dick move to get off before your reserved destination as it means someone else might have been able to use your seats.Highway buses in Japan are great but they are nowhere close to the convenience or comfort of the train. Ive caught a few overnight buses and regretted it every single time.

9332133,0,t3_589inf,Ive been to Fushimi Inari shrine and Arashiyama monkey park and the bamboo grove but not in the same day. Fushimi Inari was really quite cool. The lower main section wasnt great but the higher we got the more I liked it. We didnt realize how long the hike was before we went so we almost didnt go all the way up but Im really glad we did. The monkey park was one of my and my wifes favourite things on our trip. The hike isnt long compared to Fushimi Inari.The bamboo grove was neat but busy so not great. If it was quiet I could see its appeal. Someone else suggested they took  hours for the monkeys and bamboo grove... holy shit is all I have to say. Cant imagine most people would spend that much time there. But to each their own. The problem you might have is youll waste a lot of time traveling. The first shrine is in the opposite side of the city from Arashiyama. And Kyoto doesnt have the best transit system especially compared to the likes of Tokyo. If youre comfortable with the bus systems in Japan then that will probably help. I wasnt and tried to take trains everywhere possible. If no train was available I didnt mind walking. I didnt get a chance to get to the golden pavilion. Ive heard mixed reviews. We wanted to go but couldnt fit it in. If I can offer a suggestion Id head up to a little shrine called Otagi Nenbutsuji . My link isnt appearing for some reason. Just google it to find where it is. Otagi Nenbutstuji It was my favourite shrine the whole trip. Its sort of off the beaten path so the walk there from Arashiyama was really nice. Theres plenty of temples to view along the way too if you have time.

My local zoo is notforprofit and supports conservation with many successful breeding and release programs theyve helped to bring several local endangered species back from the brink with innovative solutions. Zoos like this are necessary for education about conservation efforts and do make a real effort to keep their animals happy and healthy. Without zoos like this people dont have a fun opportunity to learn about endangered species and what they can do to help. Allowing the public to view and sometimes interact with the animals helps fund the conservation work.Fox Village sounds as though its run for profit and not for the benefit of the animals. Foxes do not naturally live in such large packs so keeping so many together is unnatural and cruel as it stresses them. They fight over food due to the large numbers. The cages some are kept in are tiny even though it is a good idea to keep pregnant and sick foxes separate they should be housed more appropriately. While it might be a fun experience for visitors people should consider more seriously the way the animals are treated. That includes zoos as well  always research beforehand to find out if you want to support that business and their treatment of animals.

Most of them have something of interest however  for example Heian isnt a brilliant temple but it has great gardens so skim the temple and go to the gardens.  This is a good itinerary    and covers what I think are the main temples to see plus Fushimi Inari Sanjusangendo  and I guess Kinkakuji if you must... Once you have seen those if you are still interested then there are plenty more if you arent then see other things markets castle Gion Shirakawa Dori Arashiyama. You wont run out of things if you have  or  full days in Kyoto plus side trips. rabbitting on... anyway for the side trips Nara if you leave early you can be back mid afternoon and for example see Fushimi Inari on that day Himeji is definitely worth getting to as early as possible it gets very crowded and you can be back early afternoon.

To explain our itinerary has a little unorthodox although still hella fun and had us travelling back and forth between Tokyo to other various cities like Kyoto and Osaka.We had a JR Pass which made travelling easy and saved us a lot of money however the JR Pass only works on certain bullet trains and those trains stop running around  p.m. it may be different depending from where youre leaving from Im sure but generally we found that the ones we took stopped running around that time. However our first time taking the bullet train back we did not know this and we were too late and we had a hour train ride back to Tokyo with no other known way to get back. We were aware that we had the option to stay at a capsule hotel or somewhere cheap for the night but doing so would have messed up our entire itinerary.Luckily I had a large sum of emergency yen with me With my first trip overseas without my family my parents had kindly given me some funds lol. We one other person and I ended up using that extra money to shell out app  yen to get tickets to the laterrunning bullet train which did not come included with the JR pass.So safe bet is to always check when the bullet trains stop running...the local trains tend to run until a little past midnight but bullet trains are a little less merciless for obvious reasons lol.,JapanTravel,dd8qb2e,1,t5_2uylr

I said this elsewhere but if you want to take a non JR line then if you have a pass you just pay for the ticket if you dont have a pass you just pay for the ticketie there is no saving at all in not having a pass it makes no difference. The only difference is in your head  you think its cost you money because you could have gone via a JR line. But without the pass it would have cost you exactly the same amount of money.For me one of the attractions  over cost  is knowing that never have to go through the hassle of missing  a trainThe big downside is the fear of losing the pass for sure. ,JapanTravel,ddphx9v,1,t5_2uylr

10926104,0,t1_de6w21o,gtMy goal for the trip is to see those  things Im most interested. Then around those  sites pick the other coolest  attractions near them.Where exactly are you getting your list of the coolest spots? The problem the lists you see in online guides and even in published travel books are extremely subjective.  The monkey park in Kyoto wouldnt even make my top  for example.  They also dont usually take into account the travel time it takes to get to them or the fact that their  coolest spot might be a just down the street from another really cool spot that didnt even make their list. Japan is extremely densemuch more so than even the biggest cities in America for example and there are more cool things than you cold possibly imagine within a much smaller area than you would think.gtI just dont see the benefit of limiting myself to those certain attractions when I have a stronger interest in seeing these other  and can therefore have more locations to choose attractions Im more interested than just Tokyo attractions. gtAny specific reason people recommend doing it the regionspecific way?The benefit is that instead of traveling for half a day to see one thing thats really cool you might be able to travel for  minutes by foottrainbustaxi to see something equally cool leaving far more time to do even more cool things.  This is one of the reasons that I often argue that Japan is best experienced not as a list of attractions but as neighborhoods and districts.  You could easily fill an entire day in some Tokyo Kyoto and Osaka neighborhoods without ever even getting on a train or bus for example especially if you look at a map and see how they are interconnected.  Another reason I dont recommend zigzagging around to pinpoints on a map is that youll be missing out on so much atmosphere and so many little experiences.  The first time I ever went to Kyoto I did it with a group and we just tried to hit as many sights as we could in one day.  Even staying within Kyoto we spent a significant portion of the day on busses and trains and I couldnt understand what the appeal of the city was.  It was not really an enjoyable experience at all.  Compared to Nara which I had already explored extensively at that point I thought it was an absolute drag.  It wasnt until months later when I went by myself gave myself some breathing room that I started discovering how amazing the city really is.  Japanese cities are best experienced on foot or bicycle.  If youre making a lot of trainbus trips and spending hours in transit every day youre doing it wrong.So my recommendation would be to go to places that interest you but also give yourself time to get lost in the neighborhoods around those attractions and soak in the atmosphere.  Rather than starting from a list of places that you want to hit and then just trying to do all of them try looking at what else there is to see in the places youre already planning to vistit.gtgtFor instance if I was coming to the US to cities Ive visited Id be happy spending  days in New York  days in Chicago and  days in Boston.gtYou do understand that the Tokyo metropolitan area is approximately as big and as populous as the New York Chicago and Boston metropolitan areas combined right? Japan also has a much richer history and a greater variety of things to do than any of those cities.Going back to this example lets compare Tokyo and New York,JapanTravel,de6y961,1,t5_2uylr

You can do it in tennis shoes but youll wish you brought something better on the way down because the little lave rocks are murder. Tsukiji you can probably skip the auction I dont think its worth your time just go there whenever and check out the food options nearby and the tourist market nearby if you arent into seafood you can just skip it entirely. Akihabara isnt astronomically expensive but many of the touristy type things can be a bit pricey it really depends on what you want to do personally I dont think it has that much appeal unless you are a huge animemanga fan otherwise most of it seems pretty dumpy.  Id think Ikebukuro would be a better destination if you are just an animemanga fan and not a really huge one. Skytree is good but expensive in August visibility will be cut by humidity so seeing Mt. Fuji will probably be impossible Id go to Tokyo tower or the Shinjuku Goverment building instead. Both are located much closer to the center of Tokyo and are no where near as expensive the Shinjuku building is free. You should get pocket wifi if you have a smartphone as it will make your life a lot easier skip the rail pass you dont need it and it will be a waste of money get a SUICA from just about any ticket machine and you should be set. ,JapanTravel,de9awk8,1,t5_2uylr

I went ahead and bought a two week countrywide pass for over  CDN at the advice of my friend who had claimed to have done all the research. However when I actually started looking into all the train costs using Hyperdia our trip from Tokyo to Kyoto and back only cost around  and the few JR trains we would use to get around within each city would only have really cost maybe  a day tops. So in the end we werent saving money. We ended up having to plan another long distance day trip into our itinerary to make it worth it.In your case the  day countrywide pass with a trip between Tokyo and Kyoto and maybe some other areas will definitely be worth it.As for the passmo getting around within Tokyo etc. will be much more convenient as JR trains only get you so far.,JapanTravel,degkfep,3,t5_2uylr

11047166,0,t3_5xpvi7,You should really look at a map for some of these things.  Your arrangement of Kyoto sometimes has you running across the city to see places that are much closer to things youre doing on different days.  For example Sanjusangendo is in the southeast and Arashiyama is in the northwest.  Same thing applies to doing doing Nara and Nijojo on the same day.  Kinkakuji which is much closer to Arashiyama is also nowhere near Kyoto station so doing it on the same day you leave for Hakone just doesnt make a lot of sense to me.  Trying to do Himeji AND Osaka Aquarium AND Namba in the same day also might be too much.  I would consider cutting Osaka Aquarium or adding more time in Osaka after Nara so you can experience more than a few hours of he city.Another thingYoull be in the country for the cherry blossoms.  Dont miss Maruyama Park Shinbashidori and Kiyamachi in the evening while youre in Kyoto.  I would also recommend adding Fushimi Inari at some point.

11527062,0,t3_64irkq,I think the fact that youre trying to do so much in so little time is a bigger concern than the fact that its Golden Week.Some changes I would make for the sake of sanity If you dont have a JR Pass theres no reason to use the Shinkansen at all until the trip between Osaka and Tokyo in fact even if you had one it would be debatable.  Consider the Kansai Thru Pass  It covers most of the local train lines and busses almost everything except JR.  Even for Himeji the Shinkansen is not necessarily faster than JR express trains. Skip Osaka Castle altogether.  Its a miniaturized concrete reconstruction and is NOTHING compared to Himeji.  Split Nara and Himeji into  days.  Theyre on opposite sides of Osaka and they make no sense to do together.  I would try to get an early start for both of them so you can be finished and back to Osaka by earlymid afternoon.  Split your Osaka stuff up between the afternoons of those two days maybe north Osaka on the Himeji day and south Osaka on the Nara day. Just focus on one side of Kyoto not both.  Personally Id recommend sticking to the east side so I would cut Arashiyama and Kinkakuji altogether.  Theres more than enough to fill a full day without spending all that extra time in transit.  This post I made a while back might be useful for getting some idea of how much there is to do in Kyoto and how to group things  I highly recommend using the Keihan main line if you stick to the east side.  Once youre in HigashiyamaGionSakyoku you can get to most places on foot.  Fushimi Inari is open  and can be done at any time.   As much as I love Kobe used to live there Id probably skip it on a stay this short.  Youre already trying to cram about  days of stuff into just . I think day  sounds like it could be a nightmare.  Its around  hours each way by train to Kawaguchiko and by car its about the same assuming you are familiar with the route and driving in Japan in general.  You might also be getting some of the leftover crowd from Golden Week which is literally the worst time of year to be on the road especially to a big resort area like Kawaguchiko.  I dont really recommend driving anywhere around Tokyo even during the best of times unless you have a very good reason to and this is also the day before you leave and presumably your first trip to the country.  ,JapanTravel,dg2leio,10,t5_2uylr

11593557,0,t3_65fqx0,Way too long to stay in Osaka and Hiroshima even with day trips. Hiroshima and Miyajima can be done in a day or a day and a half if youre super leisurely and slow. Osaka takes two days max and youre already seeing Kyoto so the only major day trip is Nara unless youre trying to go elsewhere not mentioned. No need to stay in Yokohama. Its only  mins from Tokyo and all the Yokohama day trips can be done from Tokyo. Yokohama is cool but you can see all it has to offer in a day or so. Id add more time to Tokyo and possibly Kyoto. With Tokyo you can easily spend a week in the city and not see everything. You have three if not four Tokyo daytrips with Nikko Kamakura Hakone and Yokohama. Hakone can even be an overnight trip. Theres also Mt. Takao in west Tokyo. Also instead of Nagasaki why not go to the West coast of Japan and go to Kanazawa and other similar spots? The consensus is that theres little to do in Nagasaki. ,JapanTravel,dga4z75,1,t5_2uylr
