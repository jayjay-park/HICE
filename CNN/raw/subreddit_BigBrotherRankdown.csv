2298095,0,t1_clvm2zm,Without her who knows if Janelle would have made the show so theres that. I think everyone else except for maybe Sarah were heavily involved in what made BB so great.,BigBrotherRankdown,clvrdtw,1,t5_34cbk
2327098,0,t1_clzc61l,Yeah Season  had one of the best casts it was different and they all wanted to play and not lay so low. I already put David so theres a start I thought the people we would see the least would get ranked in the bottom. I hate a lot of people but they were more entertaning than the others who wanted to lay extremely low.,BigBrotherRankdown,clzcc3p,1,t5_34cbk
2430606,0,t1_cmc3lej,Pretty much.  He was just like Peter Brown except less annoying but Peter got more annoying as time progressed.  Youtubers just are so fake and keep busting in casting.  Wil is humorous in his videos but he wasnt in the house imo.  I dont mind schtick but it still has to be you just a turned up version.  Kevin was much more flamboyant in DR but thats still his personality but hes playing UTR.  Will turned up his personality even more.I dont get why there has to be a mastermind role in every season and they try and force it on people. BBCan is really guilty of it.  If they dont have one thats obvious they force the role on people. Emmett was running things through his social game and they give it to Peter.  There wasnt one.  BBCan  they gave it to Arlie and they only stopped because it was obviously Neda.In general its a compelling character but they are rare.  Not every cast has one and thats fine.,BigBrotherRankdown,cmc4ory,1,t5_34cbk
2501532,0,t1_cml1ghq,I dont know if Aneal was really delusion about his gameplay like Peter. Im no big Aneal fan but he more struck me as an excitable young guy who was just happy to play and wanted to make the most of it. Whereas Peter came off as thinking he was a BB genius who was above everyone.I also dont think Aneal was around long enough to grate on me. He came tried hard wasnt cut out for it. Went out without being bitter if I recall correctly.,BigBrotherRankdown,cml36ol,1,t5_34cbk
2541781,0,t1_cmq5lbl,Only thing that might follow I dont know if where you live in New York at your moms house at  years age what rats look like but they look like you not me because Im fabulous. is one of that lines that followed And youre psycho for caring about a boys hat that would never like you in the first place.  Serving some realness right there.Id have her higher than the other three left but I think she would fall around the  mark for me anyway.  Goodbye Candice.,BigBrotherRankdown,cmqcj2g,2,t5_34cbk
2542690,0,t1_cmq06ni,Cappy is probably the contestant Im most surprised is still in. The only reason I havent done it is in case theres someone who REALLY loathes him that wants to do a massive hatefilled rant. To me he was just a mild annoyance I dont think I could do Cappy hate justice.,BigBrotherRankdown,cmqgtb1,2,t5_34cbk
2827484,0,t1_cnpcyba,And I know people hated her voice a ton but fuck if it wasnt the cutest thing ever.,BigBrotherRankdown,cnphahz,1,t5_34cbk
2845532,0,t1_cnrh8ow,And now BB are down to their final HG. Wonder what season will last longer.  has been holding on for so long after being assassinated early on.,BigBrotherRankdown,cnrjbbg,1,t5_34cbk
3011668,0,t1_coa5m7v,I wanna give him until Frick posts his cut to make a cut just because its the final round and Id like to give him an official final cut.,BigBrotherRankdown,coa5omt,1,t5_34cbk
3037005,0,t3_2ug5wd,Btw last two cuts can just be posted here since we only have two cuts left and four officially made anyway. Next thread will be discussing the endgame and the options etc.,BigBrotherRankdown,cocs9gq,1,t5_34cbk
