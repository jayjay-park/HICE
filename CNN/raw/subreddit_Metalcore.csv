128373,0,t1_cesyc7e,And I agree. I see a lot more posthardcore influenced songs coming up in the past few years. Unfortunately for me Ive been stuck in the past listening to older bandsalbums mainly the  stuff from bands like Underoath Johnny Truant I guess more math than core Catherine The Arusha Accord amp Alesana. I think thats were the slight distaste for modern metalcore comes from that its changed so much from what many of us used to listen to  Years ago where as metal itself hasnt changed as rapidly. ,Metalcore,cet1tb1,1,t5_2rfut

583627,0,t3_20esny,Whether you guys like it or not. Matty is a Christian. I for one am happy that this album is more openly Christian. If shows that Matty is being honest in his writing. He clearly has a message he wants you to hear. Musically I like this album a lot. It feels like a good blend of the hollow and Challenger.

I think its solid and that they show potential. And I dont know how many time I can say this if people dont like it whatever. I dont care. I really dont. Literally all Im saying is that they set themselves up to be let down by assuming that they knew what this band would sound like. Yes I got a little aggressive in my first post and called some people idiots Im sure theyll get over it.The entirety of my argument is simply that by making assumptions before hearing anything people are the creators of their own disappointment.

830083,0,t3_23mdkl,One time around th grade my mother bought a Christian cd that had a lot of rock Christian song on it. One of them was an Underoath song. I listened to it a TON. I was never able to get on the internet because we lived in the middle of bum fuck egypt and had dial up. Shortly after that my family started watching a Christian rock music program that was on like every sat night. They had a lot of TDWP and Underoath so I just couldnt wait for sat night to stay up decently late and watch it. After watching that for a while there was an old Christian college in my town that had an Amphitheater. My family went to a free concert of what I am assuming to be locals. There was a pretty heavy band there. I loved them. My parents kept wanting to leave but I think I talked them into staying.

1513643,0,t1_cj5plwf,Just bring a big thing of water be cautious with your money and what exactly you spend it on. Drink only water. Avoid energy drinks and alcohol. I smoked bud all day and was okay but if youre not hydrating you will still end up feeling like shit. Sunscreen is a must as well though if you like to tan Id recommend a tank top just so you can catch some rays as well as be comfortable and cool. Buy the schedulemap thing from the people walking around selling them. This will save you a shit ton of time and confusement as well as give you something to physically write on and plan your day around. Its worth the  dollars trust me. I recommend sunglasses but nothing expensive to the point where if you lost or broke them youd be upset. Get something cheap or decent the cheapie ones they pass out or sell cheap at the show can dig into the top of your ears and rub all day with sunburn and sweat and dirt mixing in irritated ears every time for me. I recommend putting your wallet in a front pocket. Eat something before you go Id recommend bringing something in with you like a sandwich maybe get a snack while youre there but save your appetite for when you leave. Trust me steak and shake or something of the sort or better tastes fucking amazing after a long day in the sun. If you have an extra battery for your phone charge it and bring it. Reception gets shitty at warped tour with all of the equipment as well as the mass amounts of people with phones around you. Everytime I sat and watched a band my reception would die as soon as it ended and I was away from a decent amount of people I would regain connection to g and phone callingtexting capabilities. I recommend skipping the signings unless you REALLY want to meet a band prepare and be there ahead of time to be in line early. I would also say get there as soon as the doors open and get your merch and all that jazz bought first. Not only are you getting this done so youre not wasting time later. Youre also watching how much money youre spending and also getting all the good merch you want early before its gone. Sizes and specific shirts do run out. ADTR played my date a few days ago and they had a shirt that was made for that day only and it has them dressed up like the Chicago bulls holding the NBA championship and has a bunch of other stuff on it but has it dated. Cool merch and good sizes go fast so be there early. If I think of anything else ill edit this but for now I think thats the majority of the wisdom I can give. ,Metalcore,cj60foc,1,t5_2rfut

1631114,0,t1_cjkq9js,gt i still think youre cherrypicking points that arent really important to the big picture of the conversation and responding to most of my points with rhetorical questions that arent constructively forwarding the discussion. i could take the time to explain how i dont think ive used those fallacies or how i think youve used them too but then well just be arguing about fallacies and effectively be completely derailed. i do realize i mentioned fallacy first but i only did it because the entirety of the particular argument i was responding to was your argument is bullshit That isnt cherrypicking.gtbut ive thought about this a little and realized it wont go anywhere. because im fundamentally against nitpicking genres. i think it distracts people from appreciating the music itself when theyre so worried about how to label it or the backlash theyll get from the  if the label it wrong. i enjoy music a lot more when i just listen to it and take it for what it is not fret over how well it fits in some arbitrary box that people will argue about online.Cool.gteven if you started giving me more metered responses that indicated you heard what i was trying to say and countered respectfully instead of a series of condescending questions even if you won the argument and proved beyond shadow of a doubt WCAR is metalcore or whatever i would still be woefully unconvinced thats an argument worth having in the first place. agree to disagree i supposeYou are still incorrect even if you are unconvinced.Anyways since you wanted to talk fallacies so badly for some reason.

2506991,0,t1_cmktodp,I posted a reply to someone elses comment but I do have a kind of long Converge storyOn the Australian tour for All We Love We Leave Behind their Melbourne show sold out months in advance before I could get tickets so I didnt think I could go. About a week before the show some guy who worked in the kitchen at the bar I always hang out asked me if I wanted to do sound for an interview with them. He was a cameraman for some heavy music TV show and went to shows to film interviews at venues before they start. The payment for doing sound for it was tickets to the show so I said yes straight away.Now I had never done boom work before I had done shit local live shows and even shittier studio work but never location recording. So I turn up to the venue which is this huge underground club called the Hifi and we set up our gear in some room backstage. I had no fucking idea what I was doing turns out the guy who got me the job told the producer for the show that I was a third year uni student and that I knew my shit. I absolutely didnt know my shit. I eventually figured out how the equipment worked and the main camera man there was two told me that I was going to be the only boom operator. Their was meant to be two and a guy managing levels which is what I thought I was doing but I now had to do this all my self. So he told me when ever someone was talking during the ish minute long interviews I had to tilt the microphone towards who ever was speaking to pick up the sound properly. Seemed easy enough. He also said he would tap me on the shoulder when ever the boom mic falls into the shot and that if the levels dont seem right which I couldnt even fucking see while holding the boom that I should tell every one to stop the interview and fix it if the signal wasnt hot enough.So first up was an interview with Jacob Bannon I had to contain how excited I was because I was about to meet a dude that was my hero all the way through high school. Stay professional and keep up the ruse that I actually know anything about what Im doing. I introduce my self say hey and that Im a big fan or what ever he didnt really care but thats cool. It was more than obvious he didnt want to be there.So the interview starts and the guy hosting the show obviously has no idea who Converge is. Jacob realises this pretty much straight away as well I could see on his face that he was like fuck everything about this. It was cringey as fuck. I swear to god the interviewer asked him what is his favourite breed of dog and Jacob went on a  minute diatribe about how it is fucked up that you can say one breed is better than another and that we should love all things equally. He was literally preaching against dog racism it got pretty heated. I swear to god this isnt a jokeSo Im tilting the mic when ever someone keeps talking but the conversation ended up being pretty free flowing it was hard to guess when someone was going to speak so I was missing like the first word of every sentence. In my head I was stressing out so hard and my arms hurt A LOT because these boom mics are fucking heavy and I knew the sound was going to come out awful holding it consistently above your head for  minutes SUCKS. Anyway they wrap up the interview every one in the room is kind of silent because they knew it was a train wreck. Im saying to my self over and over again we can fix it in post we can fix it in post. Its all good.Then the hero of the day comes in Kurt Ballou. What a fucking legend. Literally saved the day single handedly for more reasons than one. First of all Kurt is literally the nicest guy ever we spoke for ages after the interview and holy shit he was a cool dude. Anyway the interview starts and he kills it. The interviewer and Kurt find some middle ground pretty quickly and he starts to tell all these stories about how him and his dad used to build guitars in their garage when he was a kid. It was really kind of a beautiful story they start sharing stories about their first guitars and their favourite guitars and everyone is laughing. It was going a million times better than the Jacob Bannon interview. He stuck around after and spoke to me and my friend the cameraman for ages because we were both huge fans it was awesome.So we begin to pack our stuff up I give all the gear back to the producer. He says to me IS THIS HOW THEY TEACH TO YOU WRAP UP CABLES AT UNI?! I should add this is the first time it is mentioned that he thinks Im a student so I was kind of taken aback and then just said ....yeah...?. It was awkward but what ever I was stoked that I had just got to meant Jacob and Kurt and essentially hang out with them for like an hour or two. Then we get the call from the office saying that me and the cameraman arent getting paid shit and that their were no tickets and that they didnt know what we were talking about when we asked.CoolWe just got royally fucked. The whole reason we agreed to do this was so we could get tickets to the show and they boned us after we had already done the work. Assholes.Kurt Ballou to the rescue he heard what was going on and about how bummed we were and put us on Converges personal door list. The tour manager asked for our name and said sweet just say youre on converges list at the door and your names and you will get it on Kurt.So we went to a bar up the road and waited a couple hours until the show started my cameraman friend shot a tour dvd or something along those lines for a band a year an half before and he had thought they stiffed him on the cash for it. It came through that afternoon like  or something. So we got FUCKED UP. Went to converge drank shots all night OWNED the pit because we were so wasted. Kurt sees us in the crowd and points at us smiles and gives us a nod.Life MadeThe End. ,Metalcore,cmlsw23,2,t5_2rfut

They were just the heaviest thing I could think of off the top of my head. gtI personally found the Katalepsy stuff a whole lot less enjoyable than hatebreedThats actually pretty understandable. Slam is generally looked down on for being lowbrow.  gtWhat do you think of NailsGave it a listen its miles ahead of hatebreed but I cant say Im a fan. The production is great though. Its just not busy enough. Something like Ringworm Harms Way or Integrity especially that integrity song. The vocals are the smaller part of the equation basically.

All Im saying is that when I think Nu Metal I think Korn and Limp Bizkit and I dont hear any of that whatsoever in Killswitch Engage. Postgrunge is pretty much exactly what youre describing with the HetfieldVedder vocals think bands like Creed Alter Bridge Seether Staind etc. The only reason I cited Soilwork and In Flames as remotely Nu Metal was because of their use of industrialesque sounds but like I said thats stretch cause that kinda thing has been done for a long time outside of Nu Metal.

3809517,0,t3_33zre1,I have a lot of friends who dont understand metalcore or hardcore or any of those subgenres that stem from it and I know they look at me differently for listening to it or promoting it.  They think its all doom and gloom and blah blah blah.  Anyways Im  and a girl.  I wanted to show two of my friends that it wasnt all these negative stereotypes their indie rock listening selves thought it was.  So I took two of them both guys ages  and  to a Vanna show simply because it was the next show I was going to. Vanna for the most part is such a positive band so they got the whole nineyards of pits preachy positive speeches and an incredible performance.  The show was a week ago and their still stunned by how much they actually liked it.  I feel like thats one of the things people need to be more open to.  Ive seen this before where if people can actually just get out and go to a show their whole view can change.  I dont expect either of these guys to get heavily invested in metalcore or hardcore any time soon but it sure as hell got them to shut up about the stereotypes associated with it.  That and now theyll stop referring to the music I listen to as a strange off shoot of Rob Zombie fandom. Thank God. ,Metalcore,cqqik99,3,t5_2rfut

4343018,0,t3_3ar262,I would say that if you liked songs like Count It All As Lost The Wake and Provision you would do good to check out Messengers and Constellations or even Thrill Seeker with their second singer before Jake Luhrs. Hit up songs like Back Burner White Washed and Composure for starters.If you dig songs like Creative Captivity Identity and Spirit Breaker then I would go for Leveler the album where they began to get more experimental with their music and branched out including other genres in each song. Internal Cannon is a fantastic song and one of my favorites. You might like it too. Carpe Diem is also a good one it plays out like a conversation between Jake and Dustin doing backup vocals.,Metalcore,csf6tiu,1,t5_2rfut

This release incorporates the heaviness and fluidity of both of those two records and pushes the boundaries that their more recent releases have as well to create an extremely well rounded release. This release pretty much sums up who ABR is and it is amazing. Has the amazing drums from Matt challenging and badass guitar work from Brent and JB awesome backup vocals and bass work from Dustin and amazing range from Jake. Please give this a listen if you have put off giving this band a chance. There is a reason why they are a favorite and with this release it is very much deserved. ,Metalcore,csfx0wi,13,t5_2rfut

4504589,0,t1_csyg2eb,I was thinking about that as I listened. Comparing it only to You Wear A Crown... since that was their lead single from Hollow BodiesThis song doesnt get me as pumped up which isnt a bad thing. Different songs have different themes and YWAK was more of fight song and this is more of a... Keep moving? song. Think Mosh Pit people bashing each other in the heads vs a circle pit sprinting in circles and trampling people. You can throw down to both but slightly different ways. This makes sense in my head sorry if it sounds stupid when youre reading it P Jareds screams sound a lot less strained like he got his technique down perfectly and wont break a vocal cord at any given moment. I like both styles but I think I prefer Up In Flames to YWAK. Beaus vocals seemed to have been dropped down into a more comfortable range. Hell its still damn high but his tone just sounds a lot more mature in this song vs. his previous songs. Thank God for that I love Beau he puts on an amazing show and sings perfectly live but Awakening and Witness Never actually did a full listenthrough of His Last Walk were hard to listen to for extended periods of time his voice just got annoying after a while. Even Hollow Bodies got a little annoying at times to me but not to the point where Id have to throw it in a playlist with other bands to get a break like with the previous two albums. If this is indicative of his vocal style for this record Im pretty sure this will be my favorite album by them.Overall this seems toned down a little bit from Hollow Bodies which again not a bad thing. Its still heavy as hell just a little more legato. Ive got high hopes for this album. Hollow Bodies was amazing and it seems they took everything good from that album and evolved it. Should be one hell of an adventure seeing them on Warped this year.,Metalcore,csygdia,11,t5_2rfut

4669745,0,t1_ctj36br,I agree with you in a way. I was in high school from  and I got into metalcore in . Around that time bands like ADTR BMTH Attack Attack! Asking Alexandria OMampM and WCAR were all releasing their most popular and well known material and for me thats what the genre will always be. My music taste have changed in  years and now I see myself listening to a lot more progressivedjent style of metalcore but I think that most of us look back on the past with a lot of nostalgia about what the genre was.At that time period I honestly feel like metal core had been dumbed down a little. Listen to Attack Attack!s first album or Asking Alexandrias first album and you find a lot of very simplistic instrumentation and catchy vocals. Around that age I only listened to what music was cool or anything that came on the radio that I liked and I had no idea how in depth and interesting music could be so when I first heard that simplistic music it was easy to get into since it was so similar to all the hip hoprap and pop music I was listening to at the time. I feel like it probably helped a lot of people get interested in the genre and I feel like the hopecore thing might be doing that now not that Im really a fan of it. Once I understood the scene a little bit better and started to get more familiar with the music I really started to listen to the instruments and the skill that went into music which is what led me to where Im at now and I really hope that more people start to follow that trend and the more progressive style of metalcore makes into the mainstream.,Metalcore,ctj69vk,8,t5_2rfut

4981714,0,t1_cumgpu4,I loved the themes and references and the overall feeling of the last two albums. The religious iconography and tone gave everything such an epic feel. Hell Im still finding out new things. This week Ive been digging into the backstory of the Metal Gear Solid games which Ive never played in preparation for the new one and found out Shadow Moses was a MGS reference and that choral part at the beginning is a melody from the game. But on the new tracks the lyrics are so straightforward and uninspired. On older tracks that werent really that complex like Antivist the lyrics were at least passionate. Now its an almost monotone true friends stab you in the front... inserted into the song out of nowhere. Its pretty disheartening. ,Metalcore,cumhbsk,6,t5_2rfut

During most of the songs they just lose that Erravibe that I love.I thought the new Haste the Day album was good and it was really good for a comeback album but the cleans felt uninspired almost. You can kinda hear it on World. I would have liked it better if he sounded like he used to I thinkParkway Drives new album has some hardrock rifts that I dont really think work with the songs.

6563257,0,t1_czy699o,Ill be perfectly honest hereI spoke too soon when I listed the bands I listed when I first saw your post.  I listened to the song you posted not paying full attention to the song when Im busy playing something I dont give  to music and assumed off memory that it wasnt all that heavy and listed a bunch of metalcore bands my mistake as being heavier.  I saw that hardcore was indeed heavier than anything metalcore has.  But that DOESNT mean its better.  Especially when music is so opinionated you cant go around saying people are missing something just because they arent listening to the heaviest music.  I like Dillinger I dont like a large majority of the other nonmelodichardocre bands Ive checked out including Converge.  In fact most of the songs I like by Dillinger are on their new album which Im guessing is their softest though Ive only checked out their latest  havent gone back any further save for a few songs off Option Paralysis Farewell Mona Lisa Widower Chinese Whispers.Though I have to bring up the idea that Deathcore is equal to or close to being equal to being as heavy both lyrically and soundwise.  But once again thats my opinion.The reason I was so adamant on disagreeing with you was because you came off extremely pretentiously.  Music isnt some course of attaining knowledge for a majority of people its a source of entertainment.  You keep saying youll learn more about blah blah if you try and sure Ive found lots of great bands by reaching out and actually trying new stuff out of my comfort zone Tony Danza being one of them but when you put down those who are happy with their selections for not doing so it comes off as obnoxiously elitist.Who knows maybe in the future Ill go further.  Ive already gone fairly into deathcore enjoying bands like Suicide Silence and Fit For An Autopsy when a year ago I would have never thought about listening to deathcore.  Maybe Ill eventually like bands like Converge.  But for now no.,Metalcore,czy71v3,1,t5_2rfut

7056466,0,t1_d1g4006,Haha. No but why so prejudiced against satanists? I dont even personally know any do you? I like lyrics that make you question your beliefs and the lyrics in Morte et Dabo go way beyond that. I was listening to these songs at the exact time I was realizing how religions and cults feed off of peoples fears and guilt and have done so for centuries to make them submit to their control.gtSo he came forth and said unto megtSon you are forsaken.gtCondemned for the sins that you livegtI offer you forgiveness.gtBow down before me.gtBow down before me.gtIll never bow to he who claims to be divinegtIll tear down your gates with my bare fucking handsgtAnd burn the world that you rule overgt...gtI never believed in yougtFrom what I see it was justifiedgt...gtThis power over the masses is a gift you dont deserve.Catholic priests have been caught fucking little boys literally at church. I mean growing up I actually remember being jealous of the alter boys and thought it looked cool. I mean the church then covered up for these priests and afaik not punished them  there is also no reason to believe this practice has ended.So lyrics that say fuck the churchinstitutionalized religion resonate with me. I dont hate religious people or anything. I love everyone! But I just dont think you need to pay some organization to feel spiritual andor have a connection with nature or a deity if you will.That being said I can totally get down to super religious lyrics too. ABR and TDWP are some examples. I kind of cringe if I think too much about the lyrics but its all good.. Im sure thats how people feel about this song.gtwho cares what the lyrical message isHave you heard Premeditated by The Plot in You How do you ignore the lyrics? Sure the music is first and totally kicks ass but the lyrics can really set the tone. As another example would be Attila which are not very lyrically creative but still the tone in songs like Another Roundgtespecially if it has to do with religion?Attack Attacks Shred White and Blue would be a good example of a song I love with lyrics that I have to say are a bit over the top and pretty hard to ignore if you wanna sing along.,Metalcore,d1g7k1b,4,t5_2rfut

I did notice one thing  there was definitely more thought put into some songs than others like Trapped and Sellout had all of these variations especially Sellout having almost linear songwriting meanwhile some other songs on the album were so repetitive and couldve been so much more.,Metalcore,d2xcmx8,5,t5_2rfut

There are other bands that have slowly adapted new sounds throughout albums and can more organically grow in their sound whereas it seemed like OMampM just flipped a switch.

I love Tylers voice but sometimes its too poppy for me but the majority of the time it gives the album a breath of fresh air to break up the groves. Blue Wall is a heavy one but rubs me the wrong way just seems like a blanket statement although I understand both arguments. My favs are Rank Rider Lost and Found and Slow Me Down.

Technically sound with progressive tendencies theyre heavy as hell when they want to be and its executed perfectly by their vocalist who easily is up there with the greats in regards to talent and emotion conveyed through lyrics. He sings very well soaring chorus melodies that contrast the slow brooding sections screams very well midranged with some pretty decent lows and is a pretty solid Tyler Joseph twenty one pilotsesque rapper.

7960018,0,t1_d4arhxt,gt Norma Jean was formed in Douglasville Georgia a suburb of Atlanta in .In the early s the band recorded two CDs as LutiKriss. Their first release was the  EP followed in  by the fulllength Throwing Myself on Seattles Solid State label a subsidiary of Tooth and Nail Records. Often mistaken for the controversial rapper Ludacris  who coincidentally is also from the Atlanta area  the members of LutiKriss opted to adopt the Norma Jean name.This was from their iTunes Bio so my understanding is that they played as LutiKriss until  when they released Bless The Martyr and Kiss The Child and became Norma Jean.

8362793,0,t1_d5mwbmi,Yeah production easily determines if I can listen to an album or not.Its a shame at times because it puts me off from so many great songs and albums IE Node but it also teaches me to further appreciate quality mixing and helps to further my mixing.To Releases lapse feels like it has a bit of pumping at times due to an overload of sounds bass drops were frequent iirc and the drums might be a bit too saturated but other than that I think Brian Hood did an excellent job on it.  The mix definitely fits the music.The rest of the stuff should be fine.,Metalcore,d5mwft7,2,t5_2rfut

Ibanez Iron Labels and Premiums have gone up in price a lot in the last years despite also being made in indo but if you like the wizard neck thats the only place youll find it the Ibanez neck is wide and thinwhile the brands Ive mentioned before like ESP Schecter and Fernandes have narrower but round necks which I personally prefer.Chapman guitars have their fans but I havent ried one out yet.It all comes down to trying what you like best though.,Metalcore,d5tu8en,1,t5_2rfut

8468242,0,t1_d5zud98,I have never seen someone with this opinion their self titled is the only one that I dont listen to from front to back. In fact I only synced some of the songs I unchecked the others in iTunes so that they wouldnt be added to my phone because I knew I would never listen to them.

Although Id recommend you listen through fully if you really cant bare the screams then skip songs like The Walk Totla Mad and Zyglrox. The rest have almost  balance.Listen to the whole of PII just do it. Its great. Scarlet is a clean heavy song so is Erised. Spencers vocals are so much better on this album compared to PI and all the choruses are fucking killer youll love it.For Juggernaut Alpha you should listen to Heavy Heart Alpha  Faces and Rainbow Gravity. As for Juggernaut Omega youll love the songs Priestess and Stranger Things no doubt about it.

8810877,0,t1_d76u1qq,I dont remember the exact wording but I believe they stated the instrumentals on the album were recorded all at once instead of individually. So more than likely it was something like recording drums bass and rhythm guitar all together then going back and recording some guitar leads and vocals. Before they did a lot of individual tracking.Its a perfectly fine way to recorded an album if you want to go for a more raw and authentic feel. I personally feel like the mixes Ive heard so far havent listened to the whole album sound a little flat. Not sure if its because of the recording process or if the person who mixed the album did a poor job. Im sure Ill have to give it another listen but so far Im not really a fan of this album. Im more of a FTWHH and Homesick kinda guy when it comes to ADTR with various other songs from their discography.   ,Metalcore,d76y4ln,2,t5_2rfut

I know it is unusual to go kind of raw after CC and Homesick but I can appreciate what hey were going for.Like Ive said before on the sub it kind of feels like the album Dookie sorry for comparing to Green DY only thing I can think of currently in rawness before Green Day went into making more packed songs like Bang Bang. Personally you have to appreciate the whole raw and homely feel of the instruments to fully enhance yourself in BV.I appreciate the drums on the album as the cymbals especially are very prominent. I also really dig how Kevin had decided to go a bit more creative with solos and riffs. Nothing unusual in the Bass other than in Exposed. which is a bloody ripper of a heavy song.Jeremys vocals sound really pure and reassuring in this album We Got This Forgive and Forget when compared to something like What Separates. A few times though words can be said at weird timings and it wouldnt kill them to repeat the chorus again at the end of some songs.Im kind of in the minority for preferring the pop punk songs ADTR release and We Got This is the icing on the cake for me had to try learn it on guitar immediately. Even Naivety is catchy but no where near as good in terms of the soft songs like WGT or In Florida. The heavier songs have that genuine ADTR trustworthy breakdown and the subfavoured Exposed is truly a banger.My favourites after a couple of listens are probably Justified although it kind of feels unpromising at the end We Got This In Florida Reassemble Same About You and Forgive and forget. I dont really prefer songs like Bad Vibrations or especially Bullfight which never really stuck with me even when the single was released despite the Viking metal breakdown that does sound sick. At this point in time The album compares highly with my favourite CC. But I can understand why others still dont prefer it to the more metalcorestructured Homesick. Overall they explored a different tone this album and Im a taker if you feel thats justified kek.,Metalcore,d77gyn9,5,t5_2rfut

Additionally their individual band members answers about whether or not theyre writing has slowly changed over time from no to I dont know and now most recently a sealed lip emoji indicating  that somethings up.

Unfortunately Count Your Blessings is also still not a match for me.. Listening to Spirit was strange at first. I kinda remember it like getting in touch with A Thousand Suns from Linkin Park the first time. Both have a more or less completely new sound but totally fitting with the theme of the band imo.I listened to it a ton when it came out and enjoyed it since I had a weird and little sad time. Although I havent listened to it for almost a year now I still totally like it and I am really lookin forward for their next works.,Metalcore,d96tdk6,1,t5_2rfut

10273511,0,t3_5n36b9,Are you near a large city or anything?You wanna look for small sometimes even shitty venues. In and around large cities theyre really easy to find. Half the time theyre the same venues youd find metalcore bands playing at unless theyre really famous. Sometimes local bands will tag onto legit tours in the area as openers although this generally requires your music to be online as proof of experience. Some places will have local music nights or a moderately well known local band will grab a bunch of different local bands and start a small tour in the area. But a lot of what Ive written so far relies on a decently populated and kinda urban area.Otherwise you can play at dive bars or even bars that identify as metal bars if you have em. Maybe look for metal music festivals coming through a lot of them have auditions for local band spots.Message other local bands! Building community can be a huge help.And lastly make sure you get a recording doesnt have to be a professional studio recording just yet of some of your songs and throw them on youtube and bandcamp. Start a facebook group etc. It acts as a resume. More and more places will just listen to your shit online instead of doing auditions especially if its just an open mic night at a bar or something it also helps them gauge how many people youre gonna bring in.,Metalcore,dc8k42p,0,t5_2rfut

Im eagerly looking forward to the bands upcoming fulllength not sure on the release date and have been playing this EP ever since its release.Recommended sample tracks Regress No RestFEBRUARYAdept  SleeplessAfter the Burial  Dig Deep One of my favorite releases of the year and probably my favorite from ATB Dig Deep is so incredibly good.  Shrieking guitar solos headbanging breakdowns and of course endless amounts of BRTL DJNT to keep you grooving.Recommended sample tracks Laurentian Ghosts Heavy Lies the Ground CatacombsIn Vice Versa  Empathy EPTextures  PhenotypeMARCHAsking Alexandria  The BlackAffiance  Gaia EPHacktivist  Outside the BoxKillswitch Engage  IncarnatePolyphia  RenaissanceThe Word Alive  Dark MatterAPRILDeftones  GoreErra  Drift My personal favorite release of this year hands down.  Erra is by far my favorite band in the genre so Im obviously heavily biased here.  A lot of people feel like Drift was a step back for Erra when compared with Augment .  However I think Drift is just as good as Augment the addition of JT Cavey as new Erras harsh vocalist leaves me extremely excited for the bands future.Recommended sample tracks Skyline Orchid SafehavenNorthlane amp In Hearts Wake  Equinox EP Short but sweet Equinox is best listened to as one long  minutes song.  It starts strong builds with a soothing middle section and finishes with a wonderful climax.  The lead track Refuge also has one of the years best breakdowns in my opinion.  Definitely check this short piece out.Recommended sample tracks All of them theres only three.MAYArchitects  All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us BLEGH!  This subreddit is positively obsessed with Architects and for good reason.  They came out with their seventh studio album which absolutely delivered what fans expected.  Sadly the bands cofounding guitarist Tom Searle tragically passed away after a  year battle with cancer on August .  Listening to the album now in light of Toms death is a darkly emotional experience and only strengthens the quality of Architects music.

To get quality audio though youll need a decent mic obviously and some sort of interface that plugs into your computer. For example I use a Focusrite i. Its relatively cheap and has very little delay. If youre looking to record multiple things at once though such as having lots of mics recording multiple drum heads youll need an interface that has more inputs. If youre just looking to record some guitar and vocals or something along those lines the focusrite i is a very decent choice for starting out. This is a shitty satire rap song me and my buddy made with just Reaper a mic and the focusrite i in case you wanna hear what it generally can sound like. ,Metalcore,dcp55nm,3,t5_2rfut

While I dont personally think thats ideal inb but deathcore sucks! and The Common Mans Collapse isnt even a good album! I think Ill prefer that to Matriarch.I didnt think Matriarch was a bad album much in the way I also didnt think Eclipse was a bad album but both of them were drawing farther away from the Veil of Maya sound I had come to know and love since the release of All Things Set Aside but in different ways. I think that they will complement each other nicely and if the whole album features a blend of those themes it will be a better album than Eclipse or Matriarch.,Metalcore,de3iyyw,7,t5_2rfut

11174763,0,t3_5zj85j,So uhh my friend and I started a side project. We arent planning on playing shows or anything more just wanting to record and release music for the fun of it. Sooo with that said...We are called Carbon Based from Saginaw MI. As for who we sound like its hard to say. I draw a lot of influence from TDWP and LMTF in my writing and hes more along the style of ADTR and ETF. But we just released our first song called Real Pirates for free on BandCamp so check us out have a laugh or whatever floats your boats. Our only goal was for  people to listen to our song and not hate it so anything more than that would be huge. Thanks guys!,Metalcore,deynau1,1,t5_2rfut

I saw them during The Flood Reissue tour cycle and he was great but the signs were starting to show and I have watched tons of their love footage and you can tell these shows were really wearing on him even before they released the latest album.
