5948514,0,t3_3wuxqv,Hard to say with literally no information about how you play. But heres a very general guideGenerally speaking it is best to be as Tanky as possible when starting out. Start working utility stunsslowshealsaurasetc into your build once you feel more comfortable on bard.Runes Red Hyrbid ArmorMagic Pen Yellow Health Blue MR Quints ArmorPossibly not the most optimal but its what I like bestMasteriesBeginners Go down Resolve and get either Bond of Stone or the stacking HP oneStandard Cunning gt Thunderlords decreeItemsThe typical build is something like Sightstone gt Boots gt Frost Queens Claim gt Some Aegis Item gt Some Glacial Shroud Item gt Some Tanky ItemWe can argue over the order if you want but this is generally what I find myself building.If you are dying a lot it might be because youre getting Frost Queens Claim or some other AP too early. Id recommend getting the tanky items first and then going into utility. As mentioned above slowly work towards getting familiar and putting more utility into your build earlier.So for example a beginner build might look likeSightstone gt Aegis gt Boots gt Glacial Shroud gt Giants Belt gt Upgraded Aegis gt Upgraded Glacial Shroud gt Upgraded Giants Belt gt Frost Queens ClaimThen.. after some practice you might make Frost Queens claim your first major upgrade so on and so forth.List of Item preferencesAegis Locket of the Iron Solari  When against APAD Mix Banner of Command  When against all AD  No assassinsGlacial Shroud Zekes Harbingers  If no auto attack focused AD on enemy team Frozen Heart  Generally the better buy with glacial shroudGiants Belt Dead Mans Plate  I generally prefer this item but it just got nerfed so now I dont know Randuins Omen  Especially if against a Yasuo Warmogs  If you really want to double down on HPOther Tanky Items To Consider as a giants belt item replacement ZzRot Portal  Great for manipulating waves Banshees Veil  If you are getting picked off Blademail  For all AD comps Guardian Angel  one way to solve your dying problem... sort ofSide note on Frost Queens ClaimIncredible item for bard at the moment. It scouts ahead when chiming so you dont get picked off slows enemies to set up a stun or ult offers AP which scales well with his meeps  Q  W provides mana regen gives CDR which is a high value stat for bard and the passive adds to bards tradingdmg  it is easy to proc  meep empowered auto  a Q is all  charges. That said if you are dying a lot in team fightslane you are not ready for this item. Get tankier first and then try this out.Other Tips for BardManage your mana If full on mana place an HP shrine before collecting a chime In lane try to keep your mana about  Using HP Pots instead of HP Shrines is a good use of gManage your Chimes If you see a clear trail of chimes to collect think is it dangerous to go collect them? Do I know where the enemy is or isnt? Use Frost Queens Claim to scout a dangerous area before collecting chimes Drop wards while chiming in enemy territoryriver Dont collect a chime in the lane unless the enemy isnt close enough to retaliateManage your shrines Dont clump shrines together unless you are under siege. Try to spread them out in a line parallel to the lane so you have a faster escape Shrines give a speed burst use that to save yourself if neededMisc When in fear of a gankroam stay near a wall you can journey On that note figure out the best journey locations and practice them If you are hit ulting yourself and flash out right before it lands can save your life Practice Landing your stun on an enemy coming out of a magical journey Again...

5950101,0,t1_cxzk9fn,The CDR is the big reason to get IBG. You can get glacial for tankiness or Sheen for damage early to get an extra  cdr very early in your build. This means you can cap out your cdr much earlier than if you got something like dead mans plate. ,bardmains,cxzl6xp,1,t5_37dgr

It doesnt have the mana regen and its only good for engages since the MS is when youre runing towards an enemy but I never have mana problems outside of the first like  minutes if I need to spam heals and in my opinion if they have an engage that Bard cant stop Talisman wont help either.Plus Spellthief gives you a shitload of burst on lane with a quick qaa you proc  stacks of spellthief  damage   gold or  damage   gold if upgraded to Frostfang  Thunderlords with no chance of retaliation if you hit the stun and Talisman has no useful stats for Bard outside of the CDRIm sure FQC has a way higher skillcap than talisman its so versatile and it gives you so much information that its ridiculous.All that said you can play however you want Im not trying to force FQC down your throat just stating why I think its better.,bardmains,cz6m8qa,1,t5_37dgr

6496436,0,t3_44mmpe,Cant really spam them early as the mana cost is much too high. Im not a fan of starting with the Lv  W either as the Q just forces so much lane pressure.I do like having  points in W either lv  or . That second point makes a lot of difference in the amount of health healed. I hate using the shrines in solo q since ADCs arent too familiar with the whole let it mature for double the health Theyll just waltz over it when their health bar is untouched So in review I use them heavily midgame for that little speed boost. The health it gives is negligible the speedboost is fantastic.  If im having an offgame Ill grab Ardent Censor for W buff. It gives your allies some more damage output when your W them. Pretty neat. ,bardmains,czra2k9,1,t5_37dgr
6500440,0,t3_44mrjv,Everyone is saying to harass her level  but this isnt really good because you aggro creeps and cause the lane to push. Then the wave is closer to Leonas turret and she heals up with potions and relic procs and goes on you level  or .What you do instead is play passively and control the wave so that it is closer to your side. When the wave is properly positioned like this she cannot do anything because if she goes on you she will take turret aggro and lose. If you just properly and patiently play the lane like this you will just farm evenly and be fine. Leona is a snowball champ and isnt as useful as Bard midlate game.If your adc cant control the lane for shit just try to save your Q for when she comes in. If its on CD then youre fuckedThis strat does not work vs hook champs btw obviously since they have ways to pull youyour duo laner towards them without committing. ,bardmains,czrp0fq,1,t5_37dgr

6824090,0,t3_4983ex,Bard loses hard to champions that can hard engage on him or his adc while still being tanky enough to not get chunked down or bursted by meeps or q harass. This means champs like leona with her w and naut with his shield and natural tankiness. The reason for this is that bard doesnt have instant reliable disengage just cc that has to be set up. To play this mathup well you have to firstly have the more aggressive adc for example kalista into ezreal. With out the more agressive adc you lose straight out. Having the more agressive adc in trades will allow you to make better desicions in playing the lane. Nautilus cant walk up and auto you due to the repricusions of the bard stun in minions and free harass he is tanky but not thaaat tanky. Most nauts will then use the bushes to push up and zone. you can either then put a ward down and focus on wall stuns but wasting your trinket early at a time where trinket cooldown and sightstone wards are reduced in both quantity and duration means that. constantly warding bushes will put you at risk. You can then engage on the enemy adc or zone when naut takes the bush as you have the more aggressive adc forcing naut to take the lane again. The whole mathup is about zoning the enemy adc or punishing naut from moving away from his adc. ,bardmains,d0pt5dm,5,t5_37dgr

For runes I like to go AD quints AD reds then armour blues and MR yellows. A tip I always give to new bard players I learn his Q its a weird skillshot. He goes really really well with Caitlyn as the poke is insane I find Zyra to be a big counter to Bard as well as Braum. And soraka is pretty easy to lane against and janna.

9025006,0,t3_539j53,AD Reds with AS quints or vice versa vs melee supports for some quick free poke Hybrid Pens vs Ranged supports. personally I avoid scaling runes cuz Bard is a big lane bully and I go with runes that will help me in the early levels.For blues Full MR blues are the standard unless u choose to go with CDR runes vs AD melee supports For Quints AD have the most effect obviously but only is u pack AS somewhere else. u can go also with Armor quints if youre against a bully ADC. I personally take MS quints cuz I go talismanAnd for yellows If u put Armor quints go with flat HP. If not go with flat Armor.You will always play vs an AD marksman so Armor is ofc a must have imo.Im not rly a fan of AP quints tbh because landing a  good Q or double stun Q in v can win u the skirmish so u need that Q to be up especially vs hard engage supports. A good support will punish u hard if u spam Q just for poke no stuns so AS is the safer choice between the  and has a bigger impact later on.,bardmains,d7wnx5p,1,t5_37dgr
