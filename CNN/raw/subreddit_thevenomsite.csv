1770510,0,t3_2dvxdc,Just grab the first book if its all you can afford that collects the books that you need to be reading for the whole event. The companion book has all of the tie in issues that are somewhat interesting but they arent integral to the reading of the main SpiderIsland book. ,thevenomsite,ck2btyz,2,t5_2t0xw

2276088,0,t1_clszu5o,Thank you. I made everything but the base spandex suit the belt and the weaponholsters. The armor is EVA foam anti fatigue foam floor mats put together with hotglue. The spider the eyes and the details on the thighs are craft foam hot glued to the spandex suit.,thevenomsite,clt1kb3,3,t5_2t0xw
2907781,0,t1_cnycns0,I agree with you.  Venoms appeal to me has always been that even when acting as a hero he has this monstrous side that could take over.  It made him a much more complex character and it was also just more fun to have a hero with a bit of a dark side.  Thats one thing I really enjoyed about Flash as Venom because he always had this more dangerous side that even he was sometimes afraid of but sometimes had to embrace to face his foes.  Im really not a fan of how the symbiotes have been changed from this dangerous creature that can be used for good into this benevolent species trying to save the galaxy.  It just seems stupid and doesnt match any of the characters history  I really dont think this is a good direction for Venom.,thevenomsite,cnyme6v,2,t5_2t0xw
