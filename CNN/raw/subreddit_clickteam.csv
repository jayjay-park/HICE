9114081,0,t1_d86w47w,Clickteam Fusion is much much easier its true Drag and Drop style of programming and the event editor maks everything pretty much plain english Aka Object A collides with B gt Then Do C. Gamemaker is simple but its still scriptscode in a sense.So you might find Clickteam Fusion more better for casual work like that. I know I do!,clickteam,d87d5z7,1,t5_2wzwj
