4166212,0,t3_38gy75,They dont cry at every live though maybe except Emitsun.  But the third live was one of their most emotional live since it basically spelled out their success and the saying make our dreams come true if I remembered it correctly came into reality.  Emitsuns moment gave me the feels when she choked on stage not literally and a few fans called out her name.  Then you remember back in the first live when she mentioned people told her whats Love Live? and now to have fans that knows your own nickname!  Im sure its an amazing feeling of accomplishment for the seiyuus.  The ending to the third live was probably the best moment and I strongly believed is what the season  based off its ending from.  Im assuming you havent seen it yet since the ending cant avoid copyright.  Basically the live was supposed to end and they had bokura wa ima to play them out.  Nanjou kept on going at it dancing to the song but the other members were getting off stage.  The crowd started slowly picking up singing the song Nanjou in response slightly sang with them.  Then all the seiyuus were at a lost of words and their reactions were just heartwarming.  Rippi tried to hold back her tears by squeezing her cheeks while still holding the maracas you can hear Ucchi just doing this sort of laugh Nanjou and Kussun cant keep their heads up too.  Oh and of course they finished the song with the crowd.  Heres some picture I had before  Nanjou still dancing Rippi and Pile giving this cant believe this is happening look Kussun walks up to Emitsun out of her spot since theyre close friends And more And a clip of Nanjou,LoveLive,crv5nd9,9,t5_31qlw

I listen to LL when I work out study or when I clean my house its really consumed a lot of my media consumption lol.

5859642,0,t3_3vh0ac,Ive actually been taking it pretty well. I wont deny that I did feel a little sad to hear about their end but Ive long accepted that their time would come. It is better for them to go out while theyre at their peak of popularity rather than gradually fading into obscurity or having a sudden breakup.I guess all we can do is see what becomes of them moving forward.

Theyre going to lose a lot of money if people can get their hands on the live before they even sell it an example will be the th live.  Theres people already watching it months before it even officially came out on DVDBD.  They have been doing live viewings already.  But honestly best thing to do is just wait if you cant attend of these things.  Unfortunately its probably going to take a lot longer to come out then previous lives.  Both th and th take place in the beginning of Feb th comes out on sale during Summer while th was Fall most likely cause both days are being sold.

Personally I strongly believe Honoka is the most important as she is the key that even Nozomi shed light onto.  Honoka set the flow in motion without her Nozomi can only continue watching.  Hanayo is quite important too as someone have mentioned.  Her showing up to the first live aided Honokas weak side.  We almost see Honoka break down from the turnout but Hanayo gave her hope and allowed Honoka to see that she has work hard enough to reach out to people Hanayo being the first.  ,LoveLive,cz32m0h,6,t5_31qlw

6653073,0,t1_d07fstk,We werent allowed to take videos but then again its a concert most have seen already.  I can talk about the screening from my perspective. Got in line pretty late and it was a pretty long line.  There were lots of cosplayers obviously cause you know AX.  There was a guy playing LL music and some other guy holding up bird koto plushes and yelling birb lmao.  There was a booth of LL merchandise that you pass by in line towards the entrance.  Just general stuff you can find online. You can pick up any of the available concerts BD st rd and th.  They were selling the movie unit singles too I think there were people cheering about it.  I remembered there being a cutout of a LL character and some people reenacting the praying to their best gurl bowing thing.  We werent allowed to buy anything until you enter the room iirc.  When you enter the room and if you chose to leave youll get a stamp on your hand to indicate you bought the ticket already.  The ticket is like USD? something like that.  You get a bag that comes with some LL movie ad card a set photos of each girl a pink glowstick obviously Nico is best girl to the organizers and a survey we can fill out. The room where the screening was held is quite big  There were lots of seat and actually quite a lot of empty seats too and post S LL songs were being played.  They used a PS to play the concert and it was extremely loud can barely hear what was being said.  There were people leaving in the middle of the screening etc.  Apparently some guy was handing out orange glowsticks for the snowhale.  And yes there was a orange explosion for snowhale! The concert itself is just day  with all the MC cut out with the exception of the introduction of each CV and NBG tutorial.  They kept the entirety of the encore chant..Oh and the made sure to show us the movie trailer before and after the screening.  The organizers did show up at the beginning of the screening to talk about stuff I can barely hear what theyre saying cause I sat not that close to the front and engrish.  But I did get to talk them before the screening while on the elevator didnt know they were the event organizers literally just thought they were old LL fans lol.  They were all wearing the LL jerseys.  ,LoveLive,d07hhd2,2,t5_31qlw
6653176,0,t1_d07hh8w,Honoka hate honestly pisses me off to no end. Like I get that people can get a little tired of getting promo cards of her and how people wanted some of the other girls to be center for songs but straightup hating Honoka is just kinda like???? Why would you hate Honoka??? Shes a huge influence on s as a whole and even though shes had her moments of struggling with being an idol shes been a great leader for s. Third wheel jokes involving Honoka are just kind of  because has anyone even watched Wonder Zone? All  of the second years say they love each other and that theyll stay together forever at the end of that episode. What about that says lol honokas such a rd wheel. Also I really dont like shipping Honoka with Tsubasa because theyve hardly ever interacted and the advice Tsubasa gave Honoka during the movie was more of a favor as a senpai and as a fellow idol who also had to struggle with whether to leave her group behind or go pro than it was Hey Honoka Lets Date Ok LOL. And there are many people who relate to Honoka for various reasons whether it be just because they like her energy and drive or for deeper or more personal reasons and the fact that a lot of people namely on Tumblr like to shit all over her for being the center and leader of the group and for not being an absolutely  flawless person or character is just kinda.

8451366,0,t3_4vbztz,Wow I always like Yohane but seeing he in this episode totally finalized my contract with her. I like how she is embarrassed of her persona and wants to be a normal girl. I think thats a pretty unique route in terms of anime. Im not too sure how I feel about Chika saying that she should be a fallen angle. I know shes trying to tell her that you can be whoever you want to be but Yoshiko obviously doesnt want to be as eccentric as she is. I guess in the long run as long as she gains confidence then Ill be happy. I thought of something while watching this episode out of all of the girls Dia seems the least self aware. In my opinion the others have planned ambitions and can recognize personal flaws while Dia is very much stuck within her exaggerated hardass persona. I just find it funny and interesting. Okay so Writers here are some ideas other than having the school close.  A regional LL qualifying event is coming hence a PV A group of teachers are raising concerns about the idol club. The reasoning? According to the magazines Aqours attends a catholic school. Kinda interesting I had a theory way back that between the girls having to wear revealing idol costumes and officially have Yohane the fallen angle as a member some teachers might become worried. I just hope they do do something with the catholic school premis somebody died and the school has to under go investigations....

Are they strict traditionalists like I get the feeling Umis are? Are they new age modern parents? That would give us a clue as to where Rins future lies but we dont get any of that. If she didnt go to college then she probably did some kind of on the job training. Of course now I cant think of what that would be. She didnt really have a strength other than sports. I imagine her using her idol training to get into some kind of TV sports news role but that would probably also require further education. ,LoveLive,d6noglh,1,t5_31qlw

8679068,0,t3_4yua9y,I respectfully disagree. Saint Snows song is catchy and their vocals are amazing but their showmanship dance team chemistry etc. is still rough around the edges. Personally I find their dance routine kind of awkward. On the other hand ARISE came across as being extremely polished from the way they carried themselves both on and off stage. Regarding ARISE being overly nice to Muse dont forget they first saw Muses potential back in season  when they watched their performance online. I view ARISE as a very professional group because they acknowledged and respected other groups talents. They did feel threatened by Muse and also showed their competitive streak when they told Muse they wouldnt lose to them during the meeting at UTX but they never let the competition get to their heads. Instead both groups motivated each other through friendly rivalry. This is the highest level of professionalism one can display. And it does happen in real life just look at some of the Olympians who competed in Rio so it isnt unrealistic.ARISE did not accept their defeat without fuss. In fact Tsubasa couldnt understand her groups loss thats why she seeked Honoka for a one to one talk. Tsubasa felt that ARISE trained just as hard if not more than Muse yet they still lost so she wanted to know why. She wanted ARISE to get better but she did not know how so she consulted Honoka. At that point she lacked closure. Again this showed her professionalism because she was able to put her pride aside for the sake of improving her groups performance.Saint Snow represents another type of rival and to be honest I actually feel Rias aggressiveness towards Aqours a little too much. She acts like Aqours had directly done something bad to her. But its not totally unrealistic because people who act like that at competitions do exist too. Anyhow I look forward to how Saint Snow will help to drive Aqours development. They are a refreshing presence in the show!,LoveLive,d6qi9r4,58,t5_31qlw

They were for seats to the side and the rear of the stage at Tokyo Dome where your view of the stage will be completely or partially obstructed. Basically if you won tickets for this you were only there for the atmosphere and hearing them sing live but not seeing them there were screens installed for these viewers though.I suppose the decision was made to sell these seats given the extremely high demand of the Final Live tickets then.

8766689,0,t1_d71f5rx,No! David is a sea lion but Michael is a seal and Steve is a fur seal.  And besides I think this is exactly the kind of uniqueness that Aqours needs. This isnt the us era anymore where you can just have three st nd and rd years each school idols nowadays need to be fresh and innovative. Avantgarde!  With Michael David and Steve Aqours will become a group with a lot more identity its gonna be something that only Uchiura school idols will be able to pull of. Its exactly what they need to convince people that they are more than just a us clone both within the anime and irl.,LoveLive,d71hz58,20,t5_31qlw

8820169,0,t3_50ynxj,This episode was so adorable. Can we talk about how similar Dia and Ruby scream? And the sister comedy act scene lmao. The character interactions were so hilarious and it comes from how charactertized they all are DiaRuby  sisters Yohane  chuuni Mari  Engrish aka theyre so unique and its fun to watchAlso I REALLY loved the soundtrack in this episode. After nine episodes of fairly unmemorable OSTs with the Previously on! theme being the only one I hum evey now and then I really loved Episode s soundtrack. imo Its still not as memorable as the soundtrack for Muses anime but Aqours is going for another style and the instrumentation is definitely pleasing to the ears. I could tell there was a lot of tension between You and ChikaRiko so Im really glad the next episode focuses on You. Also with three episodes left we still have another Aqours anime single coming out in October so the next episode might feature a song!Honestly Im really onthefence with Rikos situation... I was really confused with the piano competition thing. Can Riko not enjoy playing the piano unless she enters the competition? Is there some sort of cash reward for winning? I mean sure being judged by professional is lifetime advice but isnt Riko just trying to enjoy the piano again? I really didnt feel any sort of emotional investment into Rikos dilemma at all and Sunrise definitely couldve tackled it a better way. Why not explain HOW entering this competition effects Rikos life? What would happen if Riko didnt enter? What if she did enter? Its just like Kotori wanting to enter the fashion industry but that affected Muse as a whole since she would transfer abroad. And who knows? Maybe Rikos piano competition has a prize for travelling the world and playing the piano. But I just wish Sunrise allowed us to connect with her on a much broader scale. Dont get me wrong as a musician myself who has played judged performances its awesome to be judged and it really boosts your confidence. But theres always chances to have fun without being judged. Overall I loved the characters and soundtrack in this episode but Rikos dilemma DEFINITELY needed a lot of work imo.,LoveLive,d782avt,19,t5_31qlw

The thing that makes love live so successful is that its fan voted. Big idol groups have centre elections all the time thats why saqours do it. Because its what idols do. They are treated like idols and held to the same standards as idols has the emitsun scandal taught you nothing? Its not KOn! where the  main characters sing all the songs.

9296959,0,t3_57q5o4,I have a hard time choosing between Dream Sensation and Final Live as well. Although I really love the Final Live its too hard to rewatch that concert without getting too much feels.  I really think that its an amazing concert with an amazing song list.  Most of the songs were there and were executed perfectly with special mention for Sunny Day Song Angelic Angel Psychic Fire Moment Ring ?ltHeartbeat Hello Hoshi o Kazete No Exit Orion Shunjou Romantic and of course Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari.    But for me Dream Sensation is better in terms of enjoyment and how I got to know the seiyuu more.  Id like to start off by saying that Dreamin Go! Go!! is a very catchy song that was performed exceptionally well live.  Also I enjoyed how the seiyuus just derped around with their towels in front of the camera during that song.  Next was Kussuns birthday surprise.  I was really moved that they were able to prepare that surprise for Kussun.  And finally the duetsolo performances.  I couldnt stop listening to Storm in Lover after hearing it live.  I also started to pay more attention to Rippi because she did an amazing job in Kururin Miracle.  ,LoveLive,d8ugfg3,1,t5_31qlw

Either something is planned and they are just not releasing any details yet for whatever reason highly unlikely given the longer you delay the less people can come or there are no plans at all to do it for First Live. No amount of petitioning or spamming will change that fact because as MM said it is too late to start organizing such a thing even if they had all the desire to at this point.Daisuki has mentioned in a message that it is too late to organize now but they want to do something for Love Livers Meaning they know the demand is there.

10694495,0,t3_5sybcx,To add to what the other just said I personally think that having different center for most song is important for a group like muse and aqours. Other groups not limited to idol groups like bands etc. usually has that one frontman that becomes the face of the group. This will lead fans in seeing the group as the frontman and the other members which is bad.Its important for groups like aqours and muse to avoid this as this will undermine the other members and this would come negatively to the fans of those members.,LoveLive,ddj238j,7,t5_31qlw

10928727,0,t1_de736rm,She definitely improved since Kimi no Kokoro and Aquarium singles especially if you listen to her phenomenal solos in Omoi. However theres this new meme on chan of Kanan singing all the alteredautotuned parts in the newer songs because the production guys are trying to hide her bad singing. While funny to think about especially since the newest AZALEA song is called Lonely Tuning I think its just a coincidence and I really do dig Suwawas singing and I can tell that she definitely got better. Its hard because everyone in Aqours is a great singer so Suwawa and AiAi get the most hate. Anyways I love all the girls and I find their voices charming.

10953447,0,t1_de9kxfk,Exactly. It might take a long time until shes really over what happened there. Of course we can and have to! show her our support and how much we love her but no matter what we do she feels like shes failed and betreyed everyones expectations. It was their first live and lots of people were watching them either live or via stream. As you said what Rikyako had might not be an actual panic attack but rather a feeling very similar to it. Freezing and messing up when youre under very much pressure is very uncomfortable and can leave mental scars. Thats not something you can just laugh about and say its okay dont worry about it or that was sweet. I think that the way she wrote I am no longer qualified to be a professional standing on the stage actually shows how much the whole situation was to her and still is. We must respect her feelings as we keep supporting her. Otherwise its almost like saying you shouldnt be feeling that way just stop already.I really hope from the bottom of my heart that this wont haunt her too long though. All love to Rikyako ,LoveLive,de9rqlk,14,t5_31qlw

11043232,0,t1_dejho3a,I think your thoughts are by no means unfair or bias. As your writeup has shown the idealization of s as super idol group is important in understanding the complexity of Aqours situation.Now as you also said a s hardcore fan might complain that its stripping off s human side. But thats precisely it Aqours see s as an ideal and that perspective is important in understanding the inspiration and at the same time the immense pressure this brings to Aqours IRL and in the Anime.Been into Love Live! since the original S aired around early  I think. This is perhaps why my situation is kinda reversed I saw s as that human idol group that earned their popularity through sheer dedication and hardwork while Aqours are the privileged ones.What happened to Rikyako and Aqours made me realize that such privileged status is an ideal situation that is not so ideal after all. Its accompanied by struggles that are different from what s has encountered but are challenging nonetheless.,LoveLive,dejqbs5,3,t5_31qlw

11457882,0,t3_63jeqi,Thanks uEuropos for your acknowledgments. It was fun discussing this matter with you on discord.Ill just like to throw a few cents into the ring here. . Implications HPT sales will probably represent the ceiling of sales for any Aqours release between now and the second season. In all probability this means that it is the ceiling of the Subunit singles and Duo and Trio song sales. Unless Guilty Kiss pulls off an unlikely upset and its typical two to one advantage in view counts vis a vis other subunit songs also translates into sales margins into the K plus range.. Caveats on Day  Sale. While Day  Sales make up a large proportion of the final First Week sales keep in mind that there is a tail of a certain size that exists. As an illustration Love Live Sunshine BD sold around k on the first week three days if memory serves and k on the second week. Just to get a sense of how big the tail can be consider Muse last single Moment Ring. Moment Ring opened with k sales on the first day and ended with .k sales by the end of the week. Now the tail is unlikely to be that large for HPT.... but its still going to be significant.. Caveat on View Counts Bear in mind that view counts on Youtube do not reflect only unique views. Viewing a video again after several hours also contribute to viewcounts though mashing the replay button over and over again does not. Viewcounts have longer tails and also indicates how streamable a song is. That being said contemplating whether there is a stable conversion rate between viewcounts and BD sales for Love Live would be interesting  sadly Lantis hides the statistics of their videos making assessing this relationship difficult. Step Zero to One does have the advantage of being the title song of the First Live as well as being part of the first Single which might make its view counts an outlier,LoveLive,dfuqr9s,4,t5_31qlw

11734643,0,t3_671bsq,I had been there on Feb before st live and going again next month. If you only had one day and you are no trying to take the  train from Tokyo directly to Numazu arriving at . Just take shinkansen. It is much faster and more comfortable. You have to take early train to expand you time in numazu though.When arrived dont wait for the wrapping bus from the station and directly go to uchiura. Take off in Omosu  and rush to the school and just walk back to Numazu direction after that. And check the map to walk through all places you want to go including Mitoshi. My suggestion is you leave Uchiura before Sougetsu and take the last wrapping bus at pm need to check the schedule. But with this route you wont have time to go to Awashima. Take off the bus to numazu harbour for the gateburgers. Go back to numazu station for gamers and sunshine cafe.One day is definitely not enough for a full visit of numazu. Last time i stayed for four days and now i have to go again. Hope this may help you a bit. ,LoveLive,dgq5gti,1,t5_31qlw
