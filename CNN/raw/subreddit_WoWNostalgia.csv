People actually interact with each other helping on quests etc. World pvp! Its awesome of course sometimes you have to deal with higher levels having fun ganking you but you can take your revenge later. As for bugs havent found anything big so far. You should try it if you liked vanilla. ,WoWNostalgia,cqvh5dl,0,t5_2w57f
