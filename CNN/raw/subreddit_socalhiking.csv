There is no point being in the backcountry with a lot of people. The permitting system limits over use read abuse of the trails and camping spots and allows you to get into nature.

2022788,0,t3_2hv6lc,Larry Conn went backpacking in October  in the sierra Taboose pass area.  There was a storm that came in a day earlier than predicted.  His remains were found in June .Be very careful with the weather.  Respect its power.Most importantly  Make an itinerary and give it to someone you trust.  Make sure that if there is an unexpected storm storm or someone hurts their ankle and cant hike out that SAR will know where to look for you.  Tell your home contact when to call the authorities if they havent heard from you and make sure they can tell SAR where to find you.  Give them a description of your tent and clothes especially your footwear most SAR teams are trained in man tracking so SAR will know what they are looking for.  It could save your life.Larry was notoriously lax about this.  The only clue searchers had for where to look for him was where his car was found.  They knew he had  days of supplies when he left and which trailhead he used.  They had to search a lot of terrain rather than intensely search the trails he used.I was one of the searchers.  I found his femur.  I dont get called into the sierra unless the search has been going for a day or  already.  You can go backpacking now with reasonable safety.  Dont let me scare you too much.  Just dont make me come looking for you.If there is a heavy snow fall the best bet is to stay put and wait for the professionals to come get you out.  Dont get away from trails by wondering on the snow thinking you are on trail...  Also you will be making terrible time without snow gear...Take extra fuel for your stove.  If it snow hard you will need it to melt snow to stay hydrated while your rescue is underway.,socalhiking,ckwxxyu,4,t5_2t7b4

3426645,0,t3_2zey5s,I know a group of people that did the lower half.  They descended Ruby Canyon to meet the Piru Creek drainage and hike out towards Lake Piru where they were parked.They said the creek walk was pretty mild and nothing to worry about. Keep in mind that this is only half of your described hike and that they are canyoneers with lots of experience in water and hiking with gear.Map of route.Some good info is available in the Exit portion of the Ruby Canyon betagtAt the bottom of the last rappel head downstream RDC until the junction with Piru Creek. There are some good sandy places here to camp on the RDC side. Or you can head a little further downstream where Piru Canyon opens up a little more and there are other options for camping.gtCreek should be flowing year round. It is fed by Pyramid Lake and its required by law that they release water for the trout habitat. Therefore this is a good place to rely on for water and to camp.gtTo return to your exit vehicle you have several options. The first  miles or so will be bushwhacking along Piru Creek staying mostly on the canyon right side with frequent stream crossings and faint game trails to follow. You will eventually run into a now closed access road gravel initially then turning to paved on the canyon right side. This road will eventually lead to your shuttle vehicle at Piru Lake about  miles from where Ruby Canyon runs into Piru Creek. This is the route the first descent team used.gtThe second option is to bushwhack as noted above until you reach the closedabandoned USFS Blue Point Campground about  miles from the Ruby CanyonPiru Creek intersection. South of this campground there is a Gaging Station noted on maps located at . .. At this point reenter the now wideflatmostly vegetationfree Piru Creek wash staying on the canyon right side. Follow the wash for approximately  miles staying on the west side of Piru Lake DCR until . .. At this point leave the shoreline and hike west approx.  mile to your shuttle vehicle. This option is several miles shorter without the elevation gainloss you will encounter on the paved road and will allow you to carry much less water as you will be in the vicinity of Piru Creek the entire hike.gtIt should be noted that after Blue Point Campground there is a private ranch on the west side of the road.

While at REI recently they had the Osprey Rev . on sale for  so I had to add another pack size to my four pack spectrum. Ive been getting a little more into trail running and wanted to be able to carry more water and stay out longer so this seemed like a solid choice. I wanted to run at a decent elevation to help prepare for a planned trip this week to Inyo and Mt Langley so I went from Dawson Saddle to South Hawkins and back about  miles and k of elevation gainloss between k. It was a fun challenge that ended up being tougher for me than the longer and steeper San Bernardino a few days earlier and Id like to do more of that kind of thing but there arent that many places to run at that elevation which dont have long approach climbs so Ill see what else I can find. Unfortunately my adventure buddy got a bad cold so our planned trip this week to Inyo is postponed.
