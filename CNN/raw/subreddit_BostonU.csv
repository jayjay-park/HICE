404799,0,t3_1yom60,The only thing Im really qualified to advise you about is the natural science classes. Since Im premed Ive taken bio chem and physics. Personally and I think all of my close premed friends would agree on this I would not take CH. Looking back its not that they are impossible classes by any means I just dont think those classes are great for freshmen to take straight out of high school and that is likely why most people do not do well. The labs werent bad just kinda lame.As for BI I did not take  because of my AP credit but I heard it was alright. BI exams were tough I had Monette and like someone else said I would try to steer away from taking classes with him. His exams arent very straightforward and questions tend to get really specific. The material wasnt too bad and the labs were easy.I did not take PY because I took . I truly believe that you either get physics or you dont. Im one of those students who just doesnt really get it. It can definitely be easy when the concepts click but it isnt for everyone. I saw that you said you havent ever taken physics  dont let that scare you away from taking the class. Even if it doesnt click with you chances are youll still be able to get a grade in the B range assuming youre decent with science classes. The labs for  were easy Im not sure how  labs go.I hope this helps!,BostonU,cfmq29k,1,t5_2s4to

Close to downtown Newbury St. shopping Fenway.StuVi  amp   West campus closer to Allston. Stuvi  has apartmentstyle private bathroom amp kitchen and Stuvi has both apartment and suite style. More modern relatively new built in  and  respectively. Less oldBoston more industrial new city. Farther from the actual city but closer to Allston not the nicest area as you go deeper in but goodcheap bars and restaurants. Close to FitRec gym sports fields and CGS SHA and CFA. In addition to these you can also room in a number of brownstone suitesapartments on Bay State Rd. parallel to Comm. Ave or in South Campus. South is a little more removed by min or so from the rest of campus gives more of a offcampus but still oncampus feel. ,BostonU,ch312s5,1,t5_2s4to

The worse your number is the better you do and not as many people know aboutapply to summer swap.  Fill it out right away because the sooner you submit the higher in the queue you are.  Summer swap put me in Stuvi my sophomore yr.,BostonU,cphu41o,1,t5_2s4to

The BU judicial system isnt meant to replace a state or federal court that student code of conduct you signed when you came here is where the BU judicial system has power.

4071929,0,t3_354wcw,Heres some career advice. If you want to be an audio engineer look up job postings for audio engineers. Figure out what requirements they want taking xyz classes experience with abc etc. Make a list then when you get into school MAKE SURE YOU CAN CHECK THOSE ITEMS OFF. Get an internship ASAP and build relationships network with those people.. Get good grades. Dont double major. Its dumb because youre just adding an additional burden. All that really matters is that you have basic skills and can prove you can learn and achieve. Get good grades. Get good grades. Good grades will get you your first internshipjobexperience.. In summary get good grades dont double major. Use your good grades to get yourself experience ASAP. The only other thing you should be concerned about is making friends. Seriously make as many friends as possible. Introduce yourself to everyone in you class. Since youre still in high school if theres anyone you dont really know in your yearclass fucking introduce yourself. Get practice in now when it doesnt really matter.,BostonU,crkfdqd,1,t5_2s4to

It was a great way to bond with other floormates.  Your school supplies depends on your classes. I brought quite a few notebooks from back home but then actually every single one of my classes used laptops for the majority of our work so I never used ANY of those notebooks.
