1044156,0,t3_25n0re,Youll never make it. Not with that body..It was pm on a random Wednesday night in May. I had been rejected again. hearing the same thing overandover.    Your body just isnt bringing anything to the table..   It was always my body. What about my personality my face my talent? Its like I was just a mannequin being wheeled into every audition so I could be told the same thing over and over and over.  I had auditioned for all the major labels.. SM... JYP.. Hell I even auditioned for Star Empire. the one label who signs the most boring individuals. Even they rejected me.. There was only one more label I had to audition for.. My most favorite label with all my favorite oppers and unners YG Entertainment home of my hero CL. I was terrified to audition because I didnt want to lose the chance to see my hero. I dont know what I would do if I got rejected.. Would I even be sane or what I have a menbu? I went home and cried all night well until he came home....I want to be beautiful and I want body diversity like CL noona! I cried and fell into him before he could even say hello or ask me whats wrong. Before asking any questions he help me in his clutch until I calmed down caressed my hair and wiped my tears.  Whats wrong with my beautiful unnie? He asks. I told him that I got rejected from the most nugu label there was today because of my body.  I explained that I had given up all hope and auditioned for Star Empire in order to replace one of the two nugus that left Nugus. He didnt even know who I was talking about so I showed him a picture on my phone. Shocked he told me that he always thought they were just a pack of well trained AyeAyes that learned how to dance and lipsync.  He explained to me that every label looks for certain qualities and I havent found the right one yet.  Youre your own woman now if you want change you do it.Ive always been the type to take orders from everyone and never really follow my own path. CL noona doesnt do that.. She never says sorry! But how could I ever get the courage to never say sorry? I beg him this time he has to help me.. uschrobby you have to help me! I dont know how to change. Please just this once. He finally caved and said yes! McToasterz unnie come to this concert with me tomorrow in London its a surprise but it will show you what you need to see.  Its Thursday and were in London I still dont know who it is..  Thats when the lights go out and she arises from the big platform. IT WAS CL NOONA. HE TOOK ME TO SEE MY QUEEN MY HERO MY EVERYTHING! I cried and cried until she looked right at me during a verse in MTBD and said the most inspirational line in the song..Bippity boppity boo Hakuna MatataIt was then that I knew exactly what I had to do. As soon as I got home I went and made my transformation. I went and got some butt and breast implants a nosejob and my skin darkened. I went to the Young Money Thrift Shop and got the hottest outfit from the  rack. I had changed my entire identity I was ready.   I walked into YGs open audition and straight into the auditioning room. McToasterz is it?   No.. Thats my slave name.  Call me.. LaQuisha    They told me to start my audition. I looked those weak judges straight in the eye and said SWAG.  They were in awe one judge ukjoneslol fell out of his chair. When he collected himself he said I have never seen such body diversity in my entire life. You are the definition of Hashtag.  They handed me a contract on the spot and I signed it and took my walk of fame back to the one man who pushed me to undergo this transformation.  uschrobby I did it.. I did it all because of you.  Oppar if it wasnt for you I would still be McToasterz but now... Now I am new..I. Am. LaQuisha.,kpoop,chmz47c,6,t5_2vv9p
