1808751,0,t3_2f8lg4,Well most not all of the people that play VS are preadolecent in mind and are in it just for the lazers and spandex. As for NC the true Merica type people would consider in unpatriotic to pick any other faction.In the case of TR there arent any flashy guns or man sized shotguns to attract the retards so most of whats left are people who just kinda think the colour is cool and like the idea that they are the tactical faction.

2373696,0,t3_2m27ni,Being somebody that used to be in his actual Outfit and leaving soon after getting to know him I can vouch that he is a GARBAGE pilot. Without his minions Don is a terrible solo pilot. Probably always will be.The only good thing about Don is his network and being able to get a bunch of pilots for his zergs. Not even mediocre pilots at that.If you could get past his terrible Singlish accent which I couldnt which is also why I stopped accepting his invites whenever I was on then good for you. Hearing Fall back fall back fall back fall back.. or Mossie mossie mossie.. or Dont chase dont chase dont chase about  times per minute in his annoying voice is by far the worst thing only worsened by the fact that hes simply just a garbage pilot.Nothing about his squads are good. He refuses to be diverse in the air never really allowing anybody to pull anything but Scythe because for whatever reason having all these lockons in a group is fun..? By the time you actually get a lockon or go to shoot the ESF is usually dead. The only real talent anybody in his squad will gain will be the dodging of the other million scythes in the air and not getting rammed to death.Nothing about what DonAlfrago does is good for his squad or the game. Like many have said on here not only does his terrible squad of terrible pilots eliminate all of the air over the entire continent it eventually in turn ruins the air for the rest of the VS because then we have squads of AA maxes all over the place.The short stint that I spent in VS was damaging to my own self even when I mostly did skyknight stuff. Just the fact that I had his outfit tag next to my name brought in the hate tells. The all too frequent Get off DonAlfragos dick just became too much. Even though I was one of few in that outfit that did more solo flying than the actual joining of his squad. For most of my stay I hated joining his squads mainly because listening to his nasally annoying accent and spamming of shit was too unbearable.DonAlfrago is terrible. Full hatred and hating intended.,Connery,cm53iad,2,t5_2w2p3

Then youre either playing Vanu .. or maybe to a lesser extent TR .. or ignorant as fuck.  You take a pick NC doesnt have Gank Air Squads of the current gen ... even if occasionally someone runs one to counter the others .. its RARE ... like me as infil rare you might not understand the reference since well .. you appear to be blind as fuck.gt It should never take anymore numbers to stop a gank platoon than the number of players in said platoon. Again .. missing the part where I saidgt The amount of people required to combat said numbers would be approximately  of the entire population available at the time  offpeak numbers on NC which of course drops during these shit zergs.gt  If DonAlfragos platoon is as skillless as people claim them to be then why would it take more resources to kill them than what they themselves had? Didnt say that ... I said clearly we as a force with FAR LESS numbers versus an off peak bully ... cant raise the troops to defeat him.When he has tried this during peak? .. HES BEEN SHAT ON LIKE A STATUE IN PIGEON TOWN.  So please... get a clue.gt  And like I said before if you have a problem with how somebody plays the game then maybe its time to quit?You appear to be quite dim... so Ill requote a key point  Im not a pilot nor could I be in the current enivronment.gt The short and long of this is Dont hate the player hate the game.And the true bell end emerges grats on being a through and through shithead.,Connery,cofderj,1,t5_2w2p3

I also agree that Planetside has definitely become more to me than just just a game as Ive met new people and started making friends here.  But even then it isnt something thats so serious and meaningful to our every day life that we have to make it some serious political forum where people attack each other.  Trust me I think Shaken was over the line at times and I didnt blame others for being pissed.  I thought it was an abuse of these arbitrary powers that reddit gives moderators... but at the same time those offenses were minor.  They led to the outcry which seemed to turn into a full on campaign against Shaken and Shaken continue to escalate.  Shaken wasnt right but the witch hunt wasnt necessarily right either.  People realized that Shaken would continue to act out if they continued to provoke him so thats what happened.  He may have let it get to him more than it should have on more than one occassion but hopefully were past all of that now.  We should have never gotten to that point in the first place but we did its over and this subreddit still exists.

Kat tried to say it was her little revolution and started up Phoenix or we and targeted all our initial core players all the best ones that had been doing test server and competitive stuff and to be fair we werent that great at the time and up to this point we had not even really even been associated with her. She refused to allow Identity join and wanted to have a sort of council of like  leaders with an outfit focus on maturity ... It was all pretty tame and lame no competitive play or self improvement. Once Fancy Lurking Identity and myself got together and agreed that she wasnt the one to lead us we decided to take our players from her and made Sol Ex.

Imagine backcapping or prepping the next base but instead of just immediately dying or trading  for  youre able to trade  for . See how effective that is. The problem is that you can only take tactics so far and tactics like this only work in two situations. You either A. Outpop them too have more people on point or B. Outkill them so they have less people attacking point at a time. Many outfits that run cohesive and effective ops do backcapping all the time. Strategy and tactics are nice but will only get you so far. Connery just doesnt have enough gunplay skill to be able to effectively pull of these tactics.

4400212,0,t1_cslezdj,My medic play consists of me killing the enemy and reviving friendlies that when revived will not immediately die who are not far out of position causing multiple more deaths who are sustaining the fight and cannot get back via other respawn means if they can you may want to not revive them so they can bring more nadesCmedkits and who will actually contribute to the successful capture or defense of a base not all dead bodies need a res learn that fast.  If you are focused on healing up your wounded frontline teammates indicator something is wrong already your frontline teammates may not be abusing medkits to their fullest items that increase sustainability and survival drastically.  Rez nades arent for tossing at that guy outside who just died or for spamming on point when you all keep wiping only at the very last second thats fine but for reaching that player who downed out of your reach or helping you avoid gunfire that you would take if you ran to him.  Those  rez bano medics you see probably are playing for certs TBH are you fuckin serious?  Yes I am as you probably should take Nano or Flak as a combat medic for survival with C for breach counters with AOE heal or Shield for sustain with medkits.Revives are very overrated they are a sink of time and resources they are very useful when you skillball with large numbers that take a while to mow down but very wasteful when you are lacking killing potential and size.  Every medic taking the time to revive a downed out of position friendly is two less players actively participating in combat.  Have  downed friendlies?  Thats the time the enemy breaches at your weakest.  Toss in an EMP and Game over man.Revives are most useful for sustainability nothing more.  You are pushing up strong and suffer a few losses pick them up after the fighting is over and save some time and bolster back your numbers.  You are locked in a battle surrounding the point and have a clear line of offense?  Pick up the random player who was guarding a doorway with his buddy who died during the trade every once in a while.  At all other times?  Shoot to kill reducing revives needed which are downtime and logistics issues.I also play hard support which is killing the enemy that is killing my friendly m away from me faster then he can kill my teammate.  That is hard support since it takes skill not a med tool.  A dead enemy is better then a dead teammate and if not a dead teammate and dead enemy with a live medic is good too.Is it hard to keep a good Kd acc HS ratio and KPH with a medic?  Yes why?  Because you have to be able to kill.  What do most players lack?  Skill and experience at killing better players.  Can you keep strong stats while playing medic and still do a kickass job at supporting your team?  Absolutely.,Connery,cslmzpa,1,t5_2w2p3

The tournament schedule was provided well in advance of the tournament itself.  So its not hard to work around that.I get being angry that someone threatened to ban them.  The issue is broader than SAWS.  It only takes one asshole from an outfit to go onto the server smash continent and wreak havoc.

5776611,0,t1_cxccldo,Id argue that youre less prone to burn out because you dont have to teach every single member what to do for every ask and have more freedom to do cooler stuff in the process knowing people understand what needs to be done. The counter to that would be that the membership has a higher expectation for leadership competence since they know when youre doing something really dumb with them. This is also what attracts them in the first place. Recursion had an abundance of competent in game leaders so this wasnt normally an issue until near the time we went inactive. The reason Recursion stopped being active can be partially attributed to burn out for sure but most of that burn out was accelerated by the continued degradation of the game and outlook on future improvementsgrowth as well as the lack of actually requiring a platoon of booty warriors to get things done for most fights making it harder and harder to feed people. This was also the time where patch after patch things were actually making this type of play less fun.High skill outfits thrive with individuals looking to continuously improve themselves but for this to be sustainable you need a game that keeps raising the ceiling to grow with you. If Recursion was proposed net new today the first question I would ask you is what is the point or need?. These were some of questions the leadership was throwing around back then. ,Connery,cxd55p5,8,t5_2w2p3

He puts vision up and keeps it up consistently. That doesnt mean hes not aware of how broken dildars are and youd be silly to say that theyre not. But ignoring all that can you point to where he said that he doesnt use dildars in his post?

8612035,0,t1_d6i30qn,I believe there are multiple reasons.  First as stated in the original post I do represent a segment of the Connery population not as well represented by the existing mod team primarily the more casual outfits obviously including PINK.  However despite being from that segment I am still relatively well connected having been involved in Server Smash and other server events.  In addition when this was being discussed people viewed me as much less polarizing than certain people that may represent similar segments of the Connery population Im going to credit this to how I mostly lurk which I do understand people not being a fan of as well as having a history of being trusted in and having experience with leadership positions in and out of Planetside.  I was only involved in a few discussions regarding this so I am not sure the extent that went into moving from proposition to this vote but I am happy to help if the community feels I can.,Connery,d6i3nhh,4,t5_2w2p3

11490676,0,t1_dfyg50s,Thats cause ive been putting your basic bitch ass in line all morning. Hell you quoted me again. Never realized how much you admired me. Im actually quite flattered. This was fun for now. Getting all the facts straight. Ive learned just how much of a follower you are and now have a much better understanding of how your community managed to fail on a faction with little to no competition for members. A follower support type leaderyou splits off from a zergfit s to make something better. But then you get there and you realize you were always just an officer not a leader. Someone who is good at repeating things back that their superiors have said. Which you have demonstrated that ability well throughout this whole convo. Then we all know the story from there. A build up into nothing with and even quicker decline. Ive said everything I need to say you on this matter. You know your place. Remember it. It will serve you well.,Connery,dfygt8f,2,t5_2w2p3
