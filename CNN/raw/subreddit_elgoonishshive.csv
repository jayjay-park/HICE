5625443,0,t1_cwtzmsg,I was being facetious there. But honestly Diane probably knows Dianes pretty perceptive and Rhodas not the best liar. Or very subtleEDIT spelling.,elgoonishshive,cwue1iq,3,t5_2s41m
6130799,0,t1_cym5pbp,Actually I had the same idea Duck and Dove are old drinking buddies... maybe Dove is not as polite off duty as she appears shes REALLY tired of dealing with Graces crap completely overworked and a really hard drinker on the weekends......

6195332,0,t1_cytua16,And the main characters.  Why all all these side characters?  I didnt give a crap about them in the beginning why should I now?  Or is Naoi going to come back and explain the minutiae of her life experiences?,elgoonishshive,cytudm2,0,t5_2s41m
6846693,0,t1_d0saq8x,Id agree IF Ellen hadnt specifically said and opened with no offense meant to Elliot. Thats an odd thing to note and an odd way to put it overall and Diane noticed.,elgoonishshive,d0sdnxa,6,t5_2s41m
6966923,0,t3_4azpru,I knew Dan was a Steven Universe fan. Because really All he wants to do is see you turn into a Giant Woman,elgoonishshive,d161brh,2,t5_2s41m

8618903,0,t1_d6iy3hz,Its possible that theres literally only so much magic or magic energy to go around and that everyone has magic would end up meaning everybody can like light a match with their mind.,elgoonishshive,d6iynyq,1,t5_2s41m

9582351,0,t1_d9ty0ls,So if Rhodas and Sarahs spell are Srank how would you judge the other spells? Elliots should at least be Arank while Lukes and Justins seem more like B or C to me.,elgoonishshive,d9u7xzh,1,t5_2s41m

10849308,0,t3_5v30y1,Out of all the characters in the comic I wouldnt have expected Elliot to be the one to declare his intent to oppose the Will of Magic.Also if Magic does change Tedds not the only one theyll have working to get it usable again  dont forget Boxs vow.  ,elgoonishshive,ddz12m6,11,t5_2s41m

11781422,0,t1_dgva2ce,From Pandoras line about the Diamond my theory of the plan is basically. Get Ellen to zap Elliot. Somehow hijack the spell maybe by standing in the beam?. Thus temporarily possessing Elliot while the enchantment lasts. Use the Diamond to copy the possession enchantment into a new body. is stated  and  seem like obvious steps but  is the uncertain part. Especially because it doesnt explain why Elliot has to get zapped rather than pretty much anyone else.,elgoonishshive,dgvgn6a,6,t5_2s41m
