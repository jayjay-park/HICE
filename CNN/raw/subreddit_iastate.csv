162161,0,t1_ceww3v7,Its as dumb a tradition as it is a belief. Why should I walk around it? I have so far only heard two actual arguments. Youll fail your next test if you walk across it.. Walking across it will wear it down  its this raised design it looks kind of neat that way so lets not ruin it for future generations.To which I have two responses. I have repeatedly walked across it deliberately and consciously on my way to a final that I aced in a class that I aced.. Its designed to be worn down and will only look the way its supposed to when enough students walk across it and wear it down.So really that leaves only Proof by Angry Bearded Q which I just find unconvincing.

167240,0,t3_1vze1i,Ames is a good place. As far as I know it is one of the few places where you can actually afford to live on your graduate stipend. I was an undergrad here and am now a grad. I dont really go to the bars anymore but grad students from what Ive seen are more likely to frequent Welch Ave station Cafe B and Mothers. Ive always been more than content in Ames but if you really feel like you are missing a big city make some friends which typically happens pretty easily if you are decently outgoing and spend a weekend in Des Moines which is only  minutes away.Hope you enjoy your trip in a few weeks.

3805552,0,t1_cqq0kwn,There are a few points to be made...   What everyone is listening to on RadioReferenceBroadcastify the source that your cell phone app is using only scans the following channels Ames Police Channel  Dispatch Ames Police Channel  Information  For license information call details some officertoofficer communication this channel keeps the main dispatch channel clear for emergency use Ames Fire Dispatch Des Moines National Weather Service Metro Incident Command Radio Network Basically a multicounty system allowing communication between the NWS and Dispatch Centers very rare to hear on this feed except during severe weather  Only one channel is active at a time on the feed however all four channels could be in use.  So some pieces of communication could be cut off  ISU Police and Story County channels are NOT being scanned by that feed.  ISU Police are the agency with jurisdiction over this incident.  They requested that Ames Police and now Story County Sheriffs Department provide assistance.  The majority of the conversations that I have heard this evening have centered around Ames officers being given directions toward where they should stage.  It sounds as though their primary role at the moment is crowd control and setting up a perimeter while they work on staging and what not.  They know people are listening.  As a result officers are being informed of sensitive details through cell phones youll hear them mention PBX frequently  they are talking about telephone communication and inperson communication.  Generally speaking the only significant information youll hear over the radio are things that require rapid dissemination  legitimate emergency stuff.  Otherwise the majority of the radio traffic is pretty boring. Having said all that as a general note to everyone please exercise some caution and common sense if you do happen to hear anything significant on the RadioReference feed.  This communication is not only lacking context but if the wrong information gets spread to the wrong people the consequences could be significant.  We definitely dont want a repeat of the Reddits Boston witch hunt.TLDR  Youre only getting a fraction of the conversation.  If you choose to listen dont be an idiot.  Also stay away from the area and let the police do their jobs.,iastate,cqq2afr,8,t5_2qtol

8202131,0,t3_4rkx9q,Meeting people in class is kind of hard. Everyones just on their phones at opportunities to talk and get to know others or they signed up to the class in their preformed cliques so any advances are sort of unwelcome or awkward to them. Because how the fuck are you supposed to respond to that outgoing guy who always knows what to say and is friendly with everyone and you are just struggling to turn your homework in on time?You might make some friends by working with others but it snot a reliable way to meet people just kind of luck.That said dont be afraid to talk to people. After your  or so years here no one will give a fuck. The people you made an idiot out of yourself to will forget you and those who you successfully made friends with will be your friends for life. So go ahead and try to talk to people in your classes even if its going to fail  of the time. Make an idiot out of yourself. Talk to strangers wandering around campus. If you see any international students try and talk to them they really want to make American friends! but might not know how or have trouble breaking in... take an interest in their language and culture and theyll definitely be happy to share. The Brazilians are super friendly and eager to make friends with anyone especially.OIf you see a rabbit or squirrel running across campus talk to other people about it make a really stupid joke and ask them for their numberfacebook. It works!But going to clubs  this is probably the best and most reliable way to meet people. Basically everyone else at clubs are looking for a social life doing things with others they have something in common with. If you didnt want to do these things with other people you wouldnt go to a club for it.The fact is everyone is anxious about making friends. Even those stupid frat girls who have  friends and get drunk and are always posting about having the time of their lives  theyre doing this because it shuts up a little voice in their hearts saying youre not good enough for others you cant make friends. Almost every fucking student on this campus is insecure about their position in life wondering if theyre good enough for everyone else always finding someone better than them at things they try to do better grades greater talents better social life. Its part of the college experience and finding yourself and growing up. This means theyre going to be eager to make friends and find acceptance and develop a sense of belonging.So just GTFO reddit and go talk to some people.,iastate,d52tjbe,3,t5_2qtol
