5620808,0,t3_3s1fjt,I know that my music is in the games Surgeon Simulator and Volume. Im also an unlockable achievement in Surgeon Simulator which im proud of! ALSO Im in one of the adverts for Surgeon Simulator which you can see hereQuite often I am hired by games publishers or their representatives to make a video on my channel about their games. You can tell which videos I was hired to make as they say advert in the thumbnail and have a disclaimer in the description. However I do turn down offers from some companies if I dont think their product or their marketing is ethical or suitable.Finally I have also done a little bit of voice acting for games which is something I want to do more of. So far Ive voiced a character in Huntsman The Orphanage and am going to be appearing in an upcoming game too which I probably cant mention yet!,DanBull,cwttcqk,2,t5_2tx48
