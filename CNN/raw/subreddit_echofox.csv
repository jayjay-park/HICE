6756876,0,t3_48apth,A brand new team that had problems cause of visa looses against the number one and another top team in na and all I read not only this subreddit is change players champ pool and so on. This outcome was expected. They still have communication probs. A lot of players are still new to LCS and maybe now is the first time some players miss their home.This spit wont end number one two or three. This split is just a training. They maybe have some probs with pb communication visa but the next split matters the most. And seraph had his ups and downs at the beginning too. KFO was the star a few games ago and now the whole team had probs. Lets just wait. All they need is our support. I will be glad about every possible outcome this split. I trust them and I am looking forward to the summer split.,echofox,d0i7uel,2,t5_3beaz
