63173,0,t3_1ulxwh,Sounds to me like you have many interests that are often related in certain subcultures. Im not part of those cultures myself but I think I have met a few people with similar interests so forgive me if I make a couple assumptions to fill in some blanks. Twenty somethings who love true crime and gothmorbid dark culture often mixed with music and while not introverted feel comfortable hanging out with others who dress and act like you where I live in Toronto there is an area of the city with goths shops and handouts. Again forgive me if Ive put you in a in a box. What that does mean is that there are others just like you they are the people who follow your blog and who listen to the same kind of music maybe even follow the music culture like it sounds like you do. A group like this can also be referred to as a market.Your job should be to ask yourself what you can do for that market? Is there a large group of these people in your community you could serve with a clothing or home decor store that caters to your unique sense of style? A store does not have to be about a type of product but about a culture so feel free to have books in a store that sells art or clothing. I know you said you dont want to take on more debt so maybe look for a magazine that follows or supports your interests and work on your blog for a magazine selecting images for them that also brings in your love for searching for the history and maybe doing a small write up on its history. You could pitch it as a monthly article paid for by the word. Remember the people who follow your blog love what you do and a magazine or website might be willing to pay you for your followers. Aside from that maybe look for a club or bar that plays your type of music and caters to your style and ask them about what kind of events happen their every answer they give will have been planned by someone like you or by an organization made up of people just like you. Work for them. Good luck,careerguidance,celmefc,3,t5_2t9i0

116969,0,t3_1vdrz2,My short answer would be to take the research assistant job.There are a few assumptions you are making that a lot of people I hear considering some kind of work from home deal make. The business will continue growing forever. There will be swings in any market and eventually you will hit a point of saturation where you cant grow anymore without adding different product or making some kind of fundamental business change... Like Apple when they went from selling computers to the iPod business.   You can make your own hours and travel and have free time whenever you want when you work from home. Most people who start a business find themselves slaves to the business for years. They work harder than they would have at a regular job because their success is entirely on their shoulders. Also because they are forced to wear many hats. Business owners are often doing their own accounting sales marketingadvertising office management law etc. etc. And business needs often take precedence over personal needs... you want to take that week in Hawaii? No can do a bunch of orders just came in and need to be shipped ASAP.A traditional job has its downfall too. Traditional job has security. This is less and less true as companies focus more on bottom lines and profits... they dont blink an eye at laying off huge sections of their workers. Your not guaranteed much more in security than if you work from home. But its true they are a little more secure than working from home especially at a new venture. At least the traditional company has a track record... and there is always unemployment which Im pretty sure you dont qualify for if you work for yourself. Unless you form a corporation or something like that and pay yourself a salary... Im not expert in this areaThe bottom line I think is work on your own success. If youre boyfriend is successful he is still your boyfriend. But if things dont work out for you two on the other hand dont be so quick to assume it will something like  of all marriages end in divorce you can lose what youve put into the business and have nothing to show for it.,careerguidance,cerr1af,4,t5_2t9i0

487089,0,t3_1zmehc,I think your resume has one weakness for engineering and that is application experience.  Everything reads academically but no real world material.  When I applied for my first engineering job some of the things I talked about the most in interviews were not necessarily my internships or engineering classes but my senior project of designing and building a working remote control airplane for the SAE airplane contest.  So my first job ended up being at a defense contractor that designed you guessed it airplanes.  What are your hobbies?  Do you designbuild anything?  Any machining experience translates to design for manufacturing?  Do you have a hobby of designing stuff in autoCADsolidwords that you could share?  Have you designed things for D printing maybe?  Are you a part of any handson clubs?  This is a common thread between all of the young engineers Ive worked with in the past they were doing engineering stuff in general outside of work or school.

There are plenty of websites out there too that allow employees to review their company. Use them.Alternatively talk to your boss about your problems. There must be a reason he got hired and what he can do. Maybe hes shit at the technical side or the project management side etc. But talk to him  about internal growth how you want to take on other responsibilities or crosstrain etc. You may be surprised at his response and it may open up to you why he was chosen to be your boss in the first place.,careerguidance,ckfmz9i,1,t5_2t9i0

Even though it does give a stronger case for why you deserve that money they will assume that you are out the door in the near future even if you accept your current employers counter offer offer and may end up looking for a replacement. What you should do is come up with a calculated argument for why you were requesting a raise with a specific number. If they dont hit that number and that makes you no longer happy with your job sure search for another and you can still bring it up to your employer to let them make a counter offer but you have to be prepared to walk away when you do that. ,careerguidance,conlun7,3,t5_2t9i0

3451981,0,t1_cpln1c4,Thanks for taking the time and energy to challenge me on this! You make a lot of good points. Yes I do live a relatively comfortable lifestyle. While I do enjoy nice things my lifestyle is pretty simple no car alcohol only spending money on food and the occasional weekend getaway. I did grow up on the upper side of middle class but I dont need a lot of money to have my material needs met. You are correct in that a lot of this goes back to my perspective  or as Ill call it health. Im working on a few more options with the IBS but at some point Im going to have to accept that this is how my life is going to be. Because Im always looking for a cure or aid I tend to have a grass is always greener perspective. When Im at my best which is rare I ooze confidence and am so content with who am I that I can make the most of any situation. When Im struggling it takes a lot of effort just to get by at  my life energy goes down the toilet and tend to lean toward depression. In terms of work I think the thing that gets me excited is seeing the direct benefit of my work especially if it goes to helping someone. A lot of marketingoffice work is small thankless tasks. I guess I feel like my motivation is lacking. My girlfriend is actually studying physical therapy and sometimes consider going down that route as well. Maybe becoming a PT assistant or something akin to personal training in the healthexercise space  maybe PE teacher? Im scared to do something that needs a lot of school. For some reason Im very good at getting marketing jobs cowboying up for interviews but not super great at excelling once Im there. I think I like the idea of marketingadvertising but when I cant excel the way I know I can its difficult to keep my heart in it. At some point Ill have to accept that this is how it will be with IBS and adjust my career plans accordingly. ,careerguidance,cplr3r3,3,t5_2t9i0

3809608,0,t3_3423i6,So I dont know if this will help but you might want to reach out to people in LinkedIn who are in a position to help and just ask their advice. Years back I was interested in working in sports marketing. I emailed the VP of Marketing for the New York Mets and he replied and set up time for us to talk. Unfortunately he didnt have anything that was a fit for me but he gave me some good advice when he could have easily ignored my email. Ive found that people are generally open to helping in those situations. Maybe you can pick out some people in a position to help send a note saying you are looking to secure a position like theirs and ask if they can provide advice given your situation. Eventually you may find someone who knows of an opening thats a good fit. At worst youll get some good advice.,careerguidance,cqqixp6,4,t5_2t9i0

You are saying your personalities wont mesh very well but you only got a sliver of what they are like. You wont have any idea of what it is like to work for them. I have had interviews with people that I absolutely loved but when it came down to reporting to them it was terrible. At the same time I have interviewed with people I didnt feel too stellar about but working for them has been awesome. Each time I could not pinpoint anything that would allow me to see how it would be like to work for them. You are spending hr with one person. Thats barely enough time to figure out how it is like to work with them for  hrs a day. If the job is giving you the stuff you want e.g. pay and opportunity Id prob take it if they didnt show something that was an instant red flag. ,careerguidance,cs7egpr,3,t5_2t9i0

Every time they thought they were going to be fired or considered quitting rather than face the ignominy of getting fired they stuck it out and  behold  kept their job.Even if you do get let go I cant imagine its a big black mark. Sales is very damn difficult. Its a stressful role and sometimes no matter how much you apply yourself you dont get results.But quitting looks bad no matter what industry. Unless you have a great reason like your boss was harassing you or you were working in slave conditions you shouldnt quit.

If you are still interested in political science you could check out USAjobs.gov for entrylevel positions or you could look for internships in a field youre interested in. I would finish a year in the school if I were you. You dont want to leave them in a lurch and you want to be able to say that you completed a successful year. Make sure that you are working on activities to add to your resume and cache of examples to show potential employers your skills. For example are you working with atrisk kids at the school? There are always kids who are in need of extra tutoring or a mentor. Is there an afterschool program? Could you volunteer once a week? You dont want this time as a teacher to seem like you were just going through the motions waiting for the clock to run out. Do you want to get out of the country and gain some global experience? You could teach abroad. I know you said you want out of teaching but what if you could spice it up? Im an ESL teacher in Ecuador and its awesome. We get a  week break between cycles every  months a long optional break in the summer and a month in December. It pays for shit but its alright for living here!

5010610,0,t3_3jfd76,I think you have a pretty good understanding of the next steps. Every school counselor position is going to require a masters in order to be licensed so if you really feel as if this is your passion you should totally go for it.While prestige doesnt matter as much in the education field unless you want to work for a private school or get a PhD you should still try to attend somewhere with a solid counseling program that has connections with schools in the area for your practicuminternship. An online program might seem more convenient but youd miss out on the practical experience and connections. Minnesota is a great school and Im guessing youd qualify for instate tuition. Yes you will probably have to take out some loans but there are two things you should consider.  Look into any graduate assistantship or other work opportunities that might cover tuition and a stipend.  Since your ultimate goal I assume is working as a school counselor youd be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness on your loans after  years. Youd also only need to pay  or  of your income toward your loans during that time depends on whether you have undergraduate loans and when you took them out.,careerguidance,cupyv1z,2,t5_2t9i0

I dont know the top end of what you can make but in general engineers are going to make a hell of a lot more money. As an editor youd also likely work freelance which some people prefer but youll have to prepare for the feast or famine pay schedule that tends to come along with that. If I were you Id keep my high paying job for a while. Get another job in the industry if you dont like where you are now with a raise if possible. Pay off your school loans while youre making more money. Invest some. Keep working on your passion projects. You can probably even do some freelance on evenings and weekends to get experience and money. At some point when you have no debt and have saved up significantly so that you can survive without work for a while then consider taking a job as an editor or just trying out full time freelance. If it works out then youve started on a new career with a solid financial base.

If not Id strongly consider bailing on this plan. Its not worth taking on debt or draining your savings. Only you know how extensive your job searches have been. If you think youre letting the occasional position slip by that either of you are qualified for in the region then you could stick around for a bit and start applying to everything that is feasible. If youve already tried that and had no luck I think its time to pack it up. You can always try again. Next time apply remotely and fly in to interview so that you have positions before dedicating to the move. Good luck!,careerguidance,czxsagl,2,t5_2t9i0

Worst thing Ive heard so far is that I should of stuck to hospitality as theres no use for my degree nowadays.All of this makes me think I wasted my time really. My brother  years younger left school at  grafted as a labourer for a few years and worked his way up to tree surgeon. Hes far better off than me both financially and life satisfaction but growing up it was always instilled that education is the way forward.A few reasons I want outIts a no thanks jobs.

6728227,0,t3_46693w,Hello as a Dad needing a fulltime opportunity to feel productive and support my family thank you for caring. I would be humbled to know my wife or adult kids reached out on my our behalf to help me vocationally succeed. We live in a crazy economic time. Whats occurring is not the societal promise job or investment market I bought into as a young adult. And some days I want to lay down and cry for the ongoing situation me and other people are in. But I dont lay down and cry  I do whatever personally respectable work I can  paid part time  paid little time or paid no time  volunteering or work around the house or yard  and helping others throughout the day on the phone or inperson. Yet the past three years I know Im majorly underachieving in the income category and it hurts inside. You may think Im a flake  and maybe I am for caring more about being productive andor engaged with people than filling my wallet  so perhaps thats my problem. Yet Ive always been a hardworking problemsolver. Im educated skilled play by most rules and retain a sense of the big picture in most decisions. Ive helped a lot of people along the way working at startups and established corporations or nonprofits.I was born in  and have been regularly contributing into social security since . Ive been blessed with respectable middle k to upper income k positions. Weve had lean years and flush years  and always kept things in perspective  living within our means  no recurring debt  except our home. If you knew me  youd probably think Ive led a pretty interesting life filled with adventures. But here I am writing on Reddit about my struggle.One would think Ive got something of value with which I could support my family. But it doesnt seem so lately. Ive written and submitted more cover letters and done more resume revisions than I want to remember.  Im confident that some corner that I turn decision I make or conversation will lead to a fulfilling way for me to support my family again.So what can be done. Keep sharing your dads story and his abilities and gently remind him to share it too everywhere he goes. Hug him and tell him you love him  that youre glad hes your dad if you are and keep believing in him. Theres an old adage  its not what you know but who you know. I think thats true and maybe if your Dad and I shared our stories with more people we know our income and selfesteem would be stronger. I also believe that most men over  still have a lot to contribute. But society and our culture has to believe that too.My advice to your Dad and me  Dont give up  do whatever you have to to stay positive and engaged with society. He can make more money painting neighbors homes or ?? than flipping burgers. You cant break a computer unless you drop it  pretend its a book and play around inside its pages  use visual vs. text programs. Volunteer or work for free helping anyone just to feel of value. And mostly hug your wife and kids back because that is what most of the effort is about anyway  the relationships. All the best!,careerguidance,d0f9a0a,1,t5_2t9i0

Are you are just speculating the fact that you might get into a it? If you are not sure if you want to commit another  years on this stuff you shouldnt even consider this option. join FA. I mean this is a great feat and if you could do so I salute you. Having said that did you got an offer from them? You  sure you could get an offer from them? You sound pretty confident...which is a good thing.If you dont even have an offer from them why do you bother worrying about mandatory rotational policy? This makes more sense. You mentioned about doing ivy league but you know these guys require not just high marks from you? High marks doesnt guarantee you anything. Sorry to be blunt about this...have to get it across somehow. You will still need to deal with the business world  even with the other  options...so I dont get that argument. If you dont like the world of business how about negotiate deals with angry and impatient legal client in the world of laws?You sound like a very intelligent person so Im pretty confident with your ability.

Like I said a year or two is OK but longer than that and it can be a battle to get out.  Its not necessarily that no one at home will hire you either.  A lot of people become so complacent about life abroad and choose to stay mainly out of fear of going home or laziness.  As another poster mentioned youre not making enough money to set yourself up at home so the longer you stay the harder it is to get out.  Im not saying dont go because I definitely am glad I did.  But make sure you leave yourself options.  Young people that go out there saying life is short I dont want to waste it in a cubicle are going to eventually realize that their life teaching  hoursweek in Asia isnt as fulfilling as it used to be and theyll always be outsiders there.

Assuming the OP is a high performer the prospect of losing a crucial employee to a major competitor will often force companies to agree to better terms. When you factor in retraining costs for replacements and the potential revenue that a star employee can generate for a competitor its often much cheaper to make some concessions to a star employee than to see them run off to work for the competition.,careerguidance,d88xhwj,2,t5_2t9i0

Once at a fouryear institution try to get research experience working or volunteering in a lab or in some other capacity as a research assistant for a professor or grad student. Study for the MCAT. Be able to articulate why you want to go to medical school beyond I like science and helping people.If you want to get a PhD Get good grades in community college and transfer to a fouryear institution.  Research experience is crucial. Do a senior thesis if at all possible. Consider taking graduatelevel courses if possible. Obviously not right away but maybe as a senior. Get to know your professors preferably as their thesis student or research assistant. If thats not possible then at least participate in class try to take smaller classes where your professors can more easily get to know you go to office hours with actual questions not just to show up. If you tell them you want to go to grad school theyll probably be happy to give you advice. Having professors who know you well is crucial to getting strong letters of recommendation. This student got an A in my class is not a strong letter of recommendation because that only shows that they looked you up in their grade book not that they know you and your interests strengths motivation etc.   Look up the NSF GRFP and apply for it.

10253141,0,t3_5mrazy,There is a lot to parse here and a lot of important information missing. Things like What state you are in?How large is the company  their legal department?How litigious does the company tend to be? Has the contract been reviewed by a lawyer? What are the terms of your current employment?Along with many other factors change this situation drastically.The biggest factor is what state you are in. Many states have strong protections in these cases. They can strongly limit how such contracts are enforced. Some states limit the radius of enforcement. Others limit the situations in which they can be enforced. You should drop everything and look into this right now!Other items I mentioned play to the likelihood the contract is binding. Often smaller firms panic when a separation goes south and draft these without properly vetting them. The result is a contract that scares current employees but is not really enforceable. Honestly there is no way for me to tell here. That said this is a dead end for you at this point. Given the timetable you laid out you should have already had an attorney review the contract. The last one I mentioned is another one that you should have had an attorney weigh in on already. Depending on the terms of your employment they may be over playing their hand in forcing you to sign. Theres really no way to know at this point. So the point is moot.It is important to note that courts are generally unwilling to enforce these types of contracts in the event of termination. In those cases it comes down to a company trying to prevent you from finding work and that almost never flies. Most companies know that and do not want to get into that fight in the first place. All of that said you already screwed yourself here. I am not sure how much time they gave you to reviewsign this but you definitely hurt your position by not addressing this within that time frame. At the very least you should have spoken with them already to get more time ie to have time for a lawyer to review it. If your finances are in trouble and this puts your job in jeopardy you should probably sign. Its great to stand on principle but not when it puts youyour family in danger. ,careerguidance,dc6902m,1,t5_2t9i0

10303019,0,t3_5nhdtt,I would think that not knowing would be worse than having bad news confirmed.  I would go in dressed professionally for work and ask for clarification.  This is more about leaving a professional impression with your boss and soon to be former coworkers.  They could be your best opportunity for a future job if you are staying in the jewelry field.  Be clear that you were sick if it is true or not.  Remain calm and avoid heated arguments no matter what happens.  Unemployment rules vary but usually it is better to be fired for a minor offense than to quit but be sure to research since you might be better off having no hours for a couple of weeks then being laid off.Keep in mind that everyone is stressed out and your boss even more.  If she is the owner she might be losing everything and if she is just the manager having her store closed is a big black mark on her resume that other jewelry stores will know about.  She may have made a panicked response that she will regret. Maybe you will have hours available next week especially if others are leaving.  Maybe you have a months head start on your soon to be former coworkers to get hired by competitors.  Maybe shes an asshole.  But you need to go in and find out for sure.Ive been there.

10737920,0,t3_5tlv81,Im not in HR but I have been involved in hiring. My company doesnt have keyword match software and all applications are screened by humans. First the vast majority of applicants are blatantly unqualified so they get ruled out really fast. Of the  of so that are qualified heres what I like to seeResume is nicely formatted and easy to read. I dont have time to dig through a confusing resume looking for information. I scan them quickly so I want to see bullet points and the important things right up frontCover letter is well written with few spelling or grammar mistakes Ill forgive a couple errors since I dont hire for writing positions. I want to see an understanding of the role and a clear explanation for how the persons achievements make them a good fit and I never want to see over the top selfaggrandizing language. If possible quantifiable achievements are great increased conversions by  etc.. Its nice if you include something that shows you know what our company does and why youd like to work with us.In my industry you need a portfolio. I want to see  to  nice pieces that show your best work. I dont want to see  things that show everything youve ever done. It should be visually pleasing easy to view and your images should be optimized.I dont give a shit about your GPA your achievements from high school or your extracurriculars but I do want to see volunteer work if its relevant. I wont ding you for including these things but they dont help and they can make the resume longer and thus harder to scan. Honestly maybe  of applications I see meet these criteria.

10967105,0,t3_5wirlt,. Listen to your employees. Ask them for ideas and seriously consider what they have to say. If employees dont have any input theyll start actively disengaging from work. E.g. when having to make a choice about a software tool to use ask the people that will actually use it which one they prefer. Most people have ideas how to improve things and they want to see they have an effect.. If you have any kind of variable compensation based on performance dont print the evaluation sheet before the meeting.     Fill everything out together with the employee.. Communicate about WHAT and WHY youre doing.. Flex time. Some people like to come earlier to leave earlier some like coming later or they like to leave and come back. You can say that everybody should be there between pm so that theres a certain cohesion though.. No doctors notes for a few days. There should be trust.. A fair amount of vacation. Especially if you have knowledge workers they need this for creativity and performance.. Some fruit and water in the office for free.

Always looking helped broaden my horizon to whats out there you read a lot of job descriptions. Having regular interviews helped sharpen those skills to have a great interview when I found a job I really wanted. Personally I had a sense of what I wanted to do marketing or sales and where I wanted to go Bay Area. Some tips I wish Id known at the start of the process  use LinkedIn.

So job satisfaction in that environment has to come from yourself and doing what you love and not from recognition or appreciation from anyone else.

11092132,0,t3_5ycyju,This is long typed on mobile but there are some questions here that you need to ask yourself and some ideas that you need to meditate on.You dont need to answer to anyone other than yourself this is only reddit and honestly nobody on the internet matters beyond what you take away from posting here.My biggest question reading your post wasHow do you figure youll ets with debt? The military is a game and any personal business outside of your work or with your work wont matter when you take yourself out of the picture. Reduce your life to essential completion of tasks and eliminate anything that gives you a case of tiny heart syndrome. You can justify away why thats a bs idea and yeah this is important or this person is important or I dont havecant do insert minor crap here. Dont think about any of that now think about this All of the bs you went through until now will be a waste of your life if you dont start looking into where you want to be in  or  years. Manual labor is what you say you want to do cool lots of opportunity if you are motivated enough to take it on. College sucks yeah some people get by fine without it as long as theyve got the skills sure. Home is great uhuh dont have to go through the same routine there that I have to deal with here nosiree. But you have to  ask yourself Why do I hate being in the military?Do you get counseled often? Do you do poorly on evaluations?Do you get passed over for promotion?Do others pick on you?Do you end up doing bitchwork covering somebody elses work or tasked out by random Es when your team leader isnt around?If you ever feel like what youre doing now sucks what did you do to change that?There are many jobs in the military up for grabs to people that meet the standards and theyre usually obtainable in a short amount of time. If you were stuck in the same mos for your entire time did you talk to anyone about doing anything else? Youre in now and you have an income. You have to change your life to keep yourself out of debt if you can. Thats what rpersonalfinance is for. Dont accept being in debt unless you did something to government property that put you in debt you dont need to put up with it if you dont have to.If you have personal stuff happening figure out how long its really going to matter and focus on what will matter next month or next year. The DOD doesnt forget or forgive so whatever breaks you out of your initial commitment better be medically related or youre going to have a bad time getting out. Your discharge status will follow you if you ever want to lean on your vet status for anything. Theres a lot of good that comes from being a vet so you dont want to jeapordize that.You seem open to a gamut of labor jobs that are supposed to be open without college. But what are the requirements for those jobs? Do they need a cert? A credential? An Associates Degree? Eliminate the jobs that take any outside training to acquire and think about whats left. Will any of those be eliminated by automation any time soon? Robots GPS cameras and kiosks are going to replace some jobs soon. People that dont care about you will tell you to take bullshit job  that you dread going to usually flipping burgers but theres kiosks taking orders at McDonalds and self checkouts at stores so bs jobs arent going to be an option soon. What about a job you can get now? If you dont do anything to get qualified for a job now you wont be any more ready to go and get one when it counts.Unless you have a top secret clearance that you just updated a slim number of public or private jobs take your mos seriously. If you were combat arms you could go do private security or join a PMC but theyre going to pick people that have many deployments awards and skills before someone thats barely going to make it to six years.The reality of work is that you need to think about what youre building yourself up to be in  years. Think about how many old people complain about the work they do and what theyve been doing up until now. Physical work is fine as long as your body keeps up. How long do you think you can do that? How long do you want to? Do you want to be in charge some day? Are you content to take directions from younger people? Do you want to take orders from people that dont know your job? The military is like this and the civilian world is too but youre really on your own when you ets. Your civilian life will be whatever you want to make of it while some things are handed to you when youre still in. You wont notice until youre out but youll start to ponder why people dont do X and remember that X was something they only did when you were enlisted. You can talk about what you did but it doesnt count towards anything related to your civilian life because youre out and they stopped tabulating promotion points on your separation date.College is something that should be considered when you explore what youre passionate about and what opportunities are available. If it takes having a degree college isnt so bad when you enjoy what youre doing. If you can do without college for work you really want to do right now then its not a problem. I would only consider taking college classes in the nd situation when I feel confident about the work I did and I had an idea about what I wanted later down the road.Always consider what comes later. Can you spend  years doing something that will set you up with retirement? Is there something you would want to do later in life that can set you up for a second retirement or sustain you through the rest of your working years?I recently worked at the VA hospital near me doing a mindless job for  a day and my military experience counted for nothing. My supervisor had gotten out in the s as an E and worked a second job while constantly trying to get a higher disability rating. Another old guy got out as an E in the s bouncing from job to job until he got work as a vet and he whiled away his days watching videos about cool stuff people were done when he was in his s and s. Then there was a  year old Marine vet  kids at home spent most of the day unsupervised when he could have been doing something to improve himself in order to make life better for the  adults he was going to deal with eventually but was content to look at his phone all day and have pointless conversations with doctors who didnt even listen to him all the while vocally confident in the quality of his education that he was deftly applying to sorting and delivering folded linens to each department occasionally relapsing into moto bullshit memorized from his bygone days in the Corps.Vizualize where you want to be doing what you want to do and work towards understanding what that is and how to get there.Carry on.,careerguidance,depa7gw,1,t5_2t9i0
