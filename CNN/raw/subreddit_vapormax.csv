2768240,0,t1_cnig9qe,Even then though I vape almost exclusively at home but I still wish I were able to keep accurate tabs on where the battery is at. I would like to avoid a situation where i look forward to vaping after a long day only to find that my FM is out of battery and have to wait  hours or so ,vapormax,cniqlld,2,t5_357pv

5836175,0,t1_cxkmxy3,I use a dab tool to take it out the works best IMO. a very small amount of crazy glue on a tip of a stick can pull it out too. ,vapormax,cxkne8m,1,t5_357pv

6510013,0,t3_44spqh,Its hard to say but I suspect the third tip from the right might be the right size. I ordered this one for a totally different purpose but I just checked and there is one with a yellow tip for what its worth that seems to be the right size. If it helps you further my regular Flowermate V.S power adapter is a V .A. Amp center pin positive one. So powerwise I think that ones fine. The outer diameter of the post appears to be mm and the inner pinhole seems to be mm. But I am a yank and you know how we are with metric and damn those millimeters are tiny! Best of luck.,vapormax,czsoojm,2,t5_357pv
