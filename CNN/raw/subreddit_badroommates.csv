She have me a hella fright the other day as I thought I was home by myself and she got up at pm. They seem to think that their behaviour has no impact on other people but last time she took off to her mothers a friend must have picked her up and my car was blocked in for  days as she had parked behind me and taken the keys with her. He says he is going to move in with his Grandad and uncle and neither of them will put up with any shit. Last night I was doing the rubbish as they had filled it past overflowing and on the top was the draft of a note intended for his GD requesting to come and stay and a list of all the things they would do.

He may be staking his claim on the living room and kitchen.  Do you go to work or school?  Perhaps hes letting it all hang out and frying bacon in the nude while youre gone and he doesnt want that taken away from him when you come home and just want to relax.

Hes generally a little quirky but we have been living in the same place since over  months and there havent been any big issues. He used to go to Carpentry school and he has been doing small assignments and used to bring in a little dust but I was okay with it because I didnt want to be a bitchy roommate. But of late hes got a big roofing assignment and he brings home a lot of dust. He drops off his coat on the couch Common space and also walks around in his industrial sawdust covered boots. We had a discussion about it and he apologized and things were fine for a few days. Im generally patient but I cant spend  hours everyday cleaning up the place. I spoke to him again about it but his girlfriend was there too and she butted in and said well its his job  Deal with it. That was rude. I explained how Im developing allergies and I cant live like this.

2807653,0,t1_cnn70iq,Former dog trainer reporting in its not a breed issue its an owner issue. Learning curves are to be expected but you only enhance that behavior by reinforcing it such as taking the dog with you to dinner  it wont get over separation anxiety if you dont leave it by itself. Also leaving the dog in a larger area only makes them more anxious not less. Thats why kennel training is fantastic dogs are den creatures give them an appropriately sized den to go in to if you must leave them. Its less area for them to watch over and thus makes them feel more secure. Additionally with the dog shitting and pissing on the carpet the security deposit is already lost so I dont see where they have grounds to complain that the roommates caused them to lose money.So yeah OP and her boyfriend arent great dog people to live with.Also by not standing up for themselves and being assertive theyve allowed themselves to get into this mess. Its shitty but people treat you how you let them like someone not on the lease just moving his girlfriend in despite their complaints  evict him then!.

This is a logical leap that isnt explicitly stated and so shouldnt be assumed. If she verbally agreed to finish out the lease then she definitely has a moral obligation to do so but I wont make that assumption until it is clarified.  Legally a verbal agreement may be binding in some places but is likely difficult to prove.  Since OP isnt likely to sue I care more about whether what shes doing is morally OK rather than legally OK and that depends on exactly how far she went in agreeing to take over the original roommates lease.EDIT OK OP claims the new roommate verbally agreed to finish out the lease.

Thats her choice to be honest and while I understand it makes you uncomfortable youre just going to have to live with it.The clothes on the floor and general mess however is not something you should have to put up with. I suggest sitting her down and explaining that youd like her to clean up and stay cleaned up. Mention that you feel uncomfortable in your own house and its because of the dirtiness everywhere. However let her know that youll help out with cleaning common areas  maybe say Hey Ive been feeling really uncomfortable lately because of how messy the house is. Do you mind cleaning up your stuff? and then add something like And we can clean the common areas together every Sunday is that okay? So that she knows youre interested in making things work.Youre going to have to confront her. If you keep your things clean and work to clean common areas with her she may be more inclined to keep her shit in order. Her behaviour is a little more difficult. Its her apartment too but you can compromise. Mention to her that you work on schoolwork all day so come nighttime youre quite tired try instigating quiet hours when she cant jump around and whatnot or needs to use headphones or something. Maybe from  PM to  AM or something you both need to stay quiet. If none of this works then youll have to contact your RA.

But you can take him to small claims after the fact. This is what happens when say two roommates are joint and severably liable and one stops paying the other pays to avoid eviction and then sues the one who didnt pay after the fact.Sorry you have to lay out that money first and sue after but thats part of the risk of subletting unfortunately.

Make sure you have that done for before moving in with them whether they seem nice or not. How will you pay for your rentwhat is your budget I wouldnt say parents is a red flag  if theyre a student or in their younger s this is normal...but if theyre older or not a student then this might be a red flag while a student might always want the cheapest rent of course and everyone wants a good deal on rent if someones rent budget is month and the average minimum for the area is ....red flags all around. if youre unsure after talking to them or not pretty desperate for a roommate fast Id ask if I could call their last roommate.

It also seems like you are likely to do more shitty things in the future not because youre a bad person but because thats kind of your lifestyle right now. I would recommend trying to find roommates in the future that will be okay with things like random guys over giant messes for  hours etc. You could be a compatible roommate for some people but definitely not everyone.

As soon as the zeitgeist of the household became implicitly antiHusband ie once he was disrespectful to us she immediately began making excuses for him and defending him. So she just ends up with a personality thats based entirely on who shes in the room with which makes trying to figure out what she wants or what her next move might be basically impossible.Ive had to explicitly tell her to stop discussing BDSM with my clearly uncomfortable  year old cousin.
