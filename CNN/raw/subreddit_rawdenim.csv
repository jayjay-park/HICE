The pair shown in the picture could not have been purchased in the US dont you think? I know reddit isnt US only.  It has the little red sewn in tab on the back pocket. isnt that levi copyright infringement?also the stitching on the back pocket is sooo close to levis stitching.i guess that is one of my stickler points. I want my jeans to have that stupid little red thing there.The jeans on the blue in greens website have neither the red tab thing nor the stitching on the back pocket. I guess my question would be is there an avenue that a stickler like me could acquire samarai trousers with the red thing and the pocket stitching?,rawdenim,cego1ix,1,t5_2scl9

44727,0,t1_ceje9pu,Thats one of the craziest things Ive ever heard but now Im going back in my memory Im reminded of when I lived in Thailand and skated with a guy who had the jankiest setup all the time and I felt bad..one day I gave him some new stuff I picked up and he was super hyped..I felt really good and it seemed like an overall good situation...Time went on and I noticed he was always hinting at stuff like Man I need some new skate shoes and then it got to him just flat out asking Hey man..can I have your new shoes? I kinda need a new deck...will you buy me one?. This is a guy who didnt have the most normal upbringing or life so one day it got to the point where I basically told him directly what he was doing was rude and why he was pretty surprised and in the end understood what I was saying and seemed pretty embarrassed. That doesnt negate you did something good for some people who probably did need it andor were positively impacted by it they just might lack the social skills to respond in a proper manner. Im not making excuses for them its a shitty thing todo but dont let it make you think what you did was a total waste. One day Im betting atleast  of those people see their shitty behavior and correct it..maybe even do something nice for someone else as you have done. If you havent already I would tell the beggar in a nice way why what hes asking of you is really shitty and selfish and how it isnt going to help him moving forward in life Im assuming hes young. ,rawdenim,cejiuj7,6,t5_2scl9

Iron Hearts generally have a reputation for being impossible to fade even though they almost exclusively make heavier denim. As for comfort my Gustins oz are much more comfortable than my Nudies oz. My BOMs .oz are the most comfy after just a week of breaking in First few days were hell. Might have something to do with Zimbabwe cotton being used... Too many factors in raw denim to make a general conclusion... part of the reason why I love raw denim theres just so many variables that can affect howwhy some pairs fade and feel the way they do.One thing Im certain of lightweight is too thin for winter so theyre best for warmer climates and heavier denim is too thick for summer sweaty balls! so theyre best for colder climates. ,rawdenim,cerrh3k,4,t5_2scl9

I did have mine tapered slightly since I felt like after two hot soaks they werent as flattering as they could be but the cut works well on a lot of people. The denim is freaking sick. The texture and small details of these jeans are what make them special. oz is the heaviest denim Ive owned so far but they dont feel uncomfortable or over the top to me. Highly recommend the Ss!As far as sizing went I just went true to size since people mentioned that they will shrink in the waist a bit. You might be able to size down one but the denim is pretty sturdy and it will probably be uncomfortable for you if youre buttoning them up all the way. ,rawdenim,cfmpbxs,2,t5_2scl9

440064,0,t1_cfpnf2g,Thanks for all of the suggestions. I am working on the measurement chart and should have it up in the next few days. We just got new fits for both men and women Men  Casual fit and womens Skinny and Slim Cuts so I have been working on specing out the measurements. We have inventory of the Slim Cut in the Mens and that is why that option is up. No inventory on the Womens but we wanted to start collecting emails to send to interested parties. We have been in limbo between offering online via our website starting a kickstarter with a videographer that keeps going out of town and MassDrop for mens casualI literally just met with a designer to help make changes and updates to the site. Links all went silent when we were working on the timing of the Kickstarter because we didnt want to push to the site without a kickstarter up and without tons of inventory. We were mentioned in a few blogs and we sold a bunch but then I pulled away from that because of depleted inventory.We have about  pairs on people right now and most of them have been wearing them since July . Awesome reviews and some suggestions but multiple people have come back and bought a second pair. I would love to find out who you would think would be blogs or publications that would be getting them out there. I will upload some fading pictures of the original pairs and the pair I have been wearing. ,rawdenim,cfqdli9,2,t5_2scl9

From my personal experience with Gustin products I notice a big quality jump between MOST not all of the fabric that Gustin uses and the stuff that sixteen gets from Kuroki Mills Zimbabwe cotton too. I definitely applaud Gustin on some of the stuff theyve found and the price point theyre offering it at but I dont think any of the fabric Ive seen them use wears as nicely as what sixteen uses. After that the devil is in the details. Better stitching better patch etc. Theyre no ROY but...This is also coming from the perspective of someone that maybe isnt as effected by the price difference? Im always willing to spend the extra money for the cool little design detail or that slightly more interesting fabric. I dont even think sixteen is worth championing but I do think the denim they use is generally better than the denim Gustin uses from my personal experiences.

781848,0,t1_cgt3een,Abrasion resistance has a much or more to do with the construction of the yarn than the composition of the material itself.  Loosely twisted yarns are less resistant to abrasion because its easier to pull fibers from the yarn.  Highly twisted yarns also have poor abrasion resistance because they reduce contact area between the yarn meaning higher pressure where the fabric contacts a surface.  Similarly fabrics with more uniform crowns or higher warp or weft density will be more abrasion resistant because of better distribution of contact forces.  Id guess for the BOMs the use of a silk weft will be inconsequential with regards to the abrasion resistance of the fabric.  Denim is warpfaced so most of the abrasive contact with the fabric will be distributed across the warp.As far as creasing goes its similar to putting tension on one side of the yarn and compression on the other side so I would think it just comes down to tensile strength as I cant fathom there being a compressive mode of failure for a thread.,rawdenim,cgt5emf,6,t5_2scl9

851336,0,t1_ch11iv6,I measured at the thickest part of my thigh which for me is right at about crotch level.  I guess Im pretty used to stuffing that part of my body into my jeans lol.  I have pair of slim straight Uniqlos that were my first slim anythings that Ive been doing this in for years lol.gtWaistwise I was going to go for my usual Levis size It all depends on how you want the jeans to fit...how you want to wear them.  They are advertised as straight leg jeans which if you look at the measurements I took they pretty much are...theres almost no taper from knee to hem  only a half inch.I wrote in another post that I wanted to wear them as slim straights so another helpful redditor advised me to size down one.  You can see from the fit pics that I tried sizing down one AND two.  So far one looks like the right call!How do you want to wear them?  If you want to wear them a little looser as intended as Straight legs then I would advise going TTS.  If you want them as slim straight Id advise going down one size maybe two depending on your body type.If you want them as skinny then I think no amount of shrinking will get them there due to the lack of taper.  So getting them tailored or another pair altogether s or s I think? is the way to go.,rawdenim,ch11v6z,1,t5_2scl9

Anything less than half a trailer it becomes economically feasible to rent a  or  Penske truck and do the drive yourself. Chicago to Seattle is definitely long but you could make it into a week and enjoy some of the sights along the way. South Dakota and eastern Montana are boring but have pockets of natural beauty and tourist attractions. Western Montana the greater Rocky Mountain stretch and Washington are gorgeous and worth driving through.Honestly it comes down to economic feasibility. Easiest solution is definitely to sell everything and rebuy as needed in Seattle. Most inexpensive is doing your own drive across the country. Sounds like longhaul truckers is the worst of both worlds.,rawdenim,chr913t,2,t5_2scl9
1084764,0,t3_26j16h,Hey soAs posted yesterday I was the recipient Heebees Punch jeans. I am pretty sure on the sizing but if they didnt fit right or if they didnt sit right with me style wise I was hoping to have a tour of them going around just because they were free and I wouldnt know what to do with them otherwise.Would anyone be interested in a tour with these Heebee jeans? Theyre tag size  but are unsanforized. Let me know.I know some of you have problems with the sharkskin patch. If they are actual sharkskin then I understand why there would be a problem with that animal ethics are very important. This aspect of the jeans however is not a reflection of me or my values I simply got lucky receiving the sample and would like to contribute to making this sub more and more awesome. You guys rock and Id love to share this sample with you if they arent quite right.Ive already gotten PMs from various lurkers who have absolutely no post history in this sub or karma and I would not feel comfortable giving them away to someone like this. I would want to share it with my denim brothers and sisters.Anyway comment if you are interested and I will keep you posted within the next week or so.,rawdenim,chrl8pg,6,t5_2scl9

1109105,0,t1_chu4989,Yes I own them! I would second uBuckhum on the QC issues. Ive never had to do any repairs on my jeans except for these. Some minor threads have come loose along the outseam and I had to restitch the crotch since the stitching failed. Neither was a major issue but still a bit disappointing considering the price point. The patch is also one of the worst I have ever seen.That said as a lanky person I love the skinny guy fit and the quality of the denim itself. Its got some badass pocket bags and halflined back pockets are nice too. The hardware is rather minimal but feels solid. Probably the most impressive thing about them is the roping at the cuffs.

Those buckles  hardware are all plated will wear off within a few months of owning and made in China.  Ontop of that where are you sourcing your leather? Doesnt look like WampC or H.O....You also need to do a lot more prototyping with your belts before theyre released the buckle shouldnt be able to move around in the bend. You need to skive your leather end so that it folds nicer and move your snaps up.  Personally would HIGHLY suggest using chicago screws as people arent switching buckles enough to justify the lower of quality  strength and higher likelyhood of breakage.And I would appreciate a picture of the finished edges... as you didnt do anything to the belts in the pics.Not trying to come off as snarky but belts are DEAD simple for people to make themselves.

1224862,0,t3_2848d9,Weaver here. I apologize if this is kind of a tangent of random tidbits.The selvedge ID is probably the easiest to explain You just use a different coloured yarn for that particular warp yarn. Selvedge IDs can be as wide or as narrow as you want. If you have  warp yarns per inch of fabric you only need  warp yarns to create a distinctive ID.uyoungofthesoonests diagram shows pretty clearly how the edge is created the type of weave shown in the diagram is called a plain weave. If you have a chambray shirt this is the type of weave used to create chambray.While each warp yarn is an individual strand of well yarn the weft is a single continuous yarn that has to cover the entire width and vertical length of the fabric. The yarn is wound on a pirn that lives inside the shuttle When you watch weaving videos like Momotaros the shuttle is tossed through the shed the space created between the up amp down warp yarns.Now remember that the shuttle can only hold so much yarn. When the yarn runs out youll need to replace it. Some power looms can automatically replace the shuttle and will continue to weave others will need to be manually stopped and swapped out. If the yarn runs out near the end of the width it can be left hanging off the edge and a new yarn can be started. If it ends somewhere in the middle of the fabric it can either be pulled back or it can be tied off with the new yarn.An important detail that most people forget is that fabric is rife with errorsinconsistencies. The QC agent will often mark these points for the cutters so its not likely that youll ever see these errors. Some people love these details but from a completely clinical perspective theyre errors.If you look at the detail photo from the Story jacket youll see some points where the selvedge pulls in. This is over tension in the weft. If you consistently have too much over tension the selvedge will keep pulling in and will curl over itself.If theres not enough tension on a shot each pass of the weft is called a pick or a shot youll end up with what looks like a yarn loop The loop is created because in a  twill the weft yarn is picked up by the outside warp yarn on every fourth shot.To help keep the fabric its called fabric once its woven from curling into itself from all the tension its under a temple is used to pull the fabric to the correct width. Some temples push the fabric apart from the centre but temples on power looms pull the fabric from the edges. You may or may not ever see it in your denim but temple teeth can leave marks in your fabric These typically disappear when you wash the fabric.Uhhhh lemme know if theres anything else you want clarification on.,rawdenim,ci7eyjo,22,t5_2scl9

1238652,0,t3_28adrv,So its been a pretty awesome past two months. Before I get started on my update heres the full album in case you want to skip my babbling and just look at some jeans. As an FYI Im only really going to be speaking to some of the pictures...if you want all of the sexy sexy detail shots youre going to have to browse through the album. About the jeansLook how pretty they are!  Front  Back  The left leg stack settled really nice and the right leg stack also settled but it isnt quite as niceIm especially happy with the wallet fade especially given that I made the wallet that made that fade myself if youre interested the album on the wallet can be found here Unfortunately Im probably going to be switching to a super thin profile wallet sometime soon...I just cant get myself to stop using this one though because its mine.I started getting some decent knee fades by building Ikea furniture after moving into my new place.Oh and I spent a day or so laying on the asphalt underneath a friends car doing some routine maintinance and ended up getting some good scratching on the patch which has since healed up into a beautiful shiny patinaAs a bonus I also bought a new belt from Tanner Goods about a week into the competition to wear in alongside these jeans. Its looking pretty good and the back side is thoroughly covered in indigoWhats up with you KingOCarrotFlowers?Had an incredible journey these past few months. I finished my undergrad graduating in my x no less and so that was pretty exciting. I moved away from college just a day or two after graduation. Im not usually one to wear tshirts but they gave me an alumni tshirt at my graduation and leaving my college town for good while wearing it had a certain poetry to it that I couldnt pass up. I moved back to Oregon which is the greatest state in existance in order to start my job at IntelThe apartment that I moved into has the highest showerheads of any place Ive ever lived in and a freaking walkin closet to store my jeans.One day for work we went out to do some community service for a quarterly activity and I spent much of the day shovelling bark to make a trail for a local park.Oh and in other news Im also growing a yeard now.

1411067,0,t1_cit1v67,I think one moment that stands out for me in this subreddit is when that dude posted about owning like  different pairs of Gustin jeans.  I mean that guy might have had a shopping addiction but many people were flaming him about them and he eventually caved sold all his pants and bought some rrawdenim approved brand.  I understand it may have been better to buy one pair of high quality jeans over a ton of lower quality but I think one of the fun things about raw denim especially with brands like Gustine and NampF is all the funky options you get and the little details about them that make them different.  I do like this subreddit a lot and I think my sense of fashion is more in tune with what people post here rather than in MFA but that thread sticks out as one of the more negative things Ive seen here.,rawdenim,cit5niw,1,t5_2scl9

They cater to different people for different reasons. is a large markup at the US retailersand sometimes its even more than that. But thats fine if I wanna go on a journey to a good retailer have a knowledgable chat and speak with somebody about the denim and fits that would be good for me Id be inclined to pay it.But then you have people who know exactly what they want what fit they want and size they need. People like that? They just wanna order their pants. Thats what Im gonna do for my next pair and its probably coming from Denimio for that reason. If Denimio didnt exist Id be ordering off Rakuten.

In terms of sizing I sized up from  normally in things like Weird Guys and Rogue Territory STs to a  in this one. The waist is larger than I need but I hot soaked the waist to bring the waist in and have belted them. I guess it depends what the limiting factor is for you... waist or thighs. For me it was thighs so I had to size up.,rawdenim,cjdc8fn,4,t5_2scl9

Certainly the only prevalent one. So the  STF is the only jean you would need to methodically size and then shrink in hot water. The other rigid jeans are sanforized and will  more or less  be true to size. Theyre still raw though so thats an important distinction to make.Ha! Dont feel too bad Ive heard that before.

Now the jeans are bright blue to white where theres fades but all in the vibrant royal blue shade. They look awesome in my opinion and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. All the hardware and riveting is good and theres been no issues with crotch blowout thanks to the smart fits.However they are not nearly as tough or long lasting as high end japanese brands like samurai or flat head. Ide say Acne jeans are better than nudies because they can be washed regularly and wont get that greasy look.I havent worn them in a while because they are too tight in the thigh and its causing the jeans to wear down faster. ,rawdenim,cjm1fhd,1,t5_2scl9

The store is a physical location for a separate business so they arent always open. They had a few pairs of Filson denim which share a fabric with one of the Tellason lines and has a few duck canvas accents.  Orn Hansen is moving to Portland soon so a lot of the store is on sale. I got a West is Dead sweater there and Ill probably go back for Jungmaven shirts before they go. Snake Oil Provisions carries PF Flyers Red Wings and Rogue Territory so I can do most of my future shopping in one store. They also had Apolis chore coats which I hadnt seen in person before. Ill be back to pick up these PF Flyers as a replacement for my current pair.

The lifetime repair guarantee sounds like a good thing if you live within a reasonable shipping range and custom hemming is nice as well.The problem is of course that theyre going to be doing all of these things at once  shipping out a massive variety of denims with sanforized and unsanforized options is insanely tricky especially for a ship date thats only two months from now.

1993630,0,t1_cktegoo,gtBack when Tomsan and Haraki designed these jeans having side seam selvedge was completely unimportant to Haraki. The jeans were made from our signature oz denim they were constructed beautifully the motorcycle community in Japan does not particularly care about side seam selvedge and for this model it was easier to get the desired slim cut by not utilising the side selvedge so they did not bother. From a functional point of view it made no difference. It was just not important to him and interestingly Haraki did not at that time appreciate the importance of showing the selvedge as part of the provenance of the denim. Since I have been working with Haraki and the west has become more and more important and influential on our direction and aesthetic he understands that showing side seam selvedge is desired so we do.From Giles and the IH AMA. ,rawdenim,cktflcd,5,t5_2scl9

2108801,0,t1_cl7ukzr,The NC No Change features a cotton selvage denim with the unique characteristic of retaining its deep Blue color through repeated wash and wear while resisting the color fading that Pure Blue Japan jeans are usually known for. This was thought to be useful for those who would prefer to have at least a single pair of jeans they could wear often but that could also act as a stilldark denim jean when the occasion called for it.Indanthrene is a waterinsoluble dye stuff that retains its color with repeated washing wear and distress exposure to sunlight and in most cases is even resistant to acids and chlorine bleach. Indanthrene dye is commonly used in Military uniforms due to its high degree of color fasting and its ability to withstand extreme exposure to the roughest of weather. Its also used as pigments in high quality paints and enamels. The NC denim shares the same weave and slubby texture of the XX denim and will still show slight signs of color falling and distress as the cotton wears thin but will not break down to the light shades of blue and white seen with indigo dyed XX denim.,rawdenim,cl7vh9l,1,t5_2scl9

2193426,0,t3_2k7icw,I cannot say that I often consider the ecological impact.  I do appreciate paying someone directly for the product of their skilled labor.  As for the taxation issue mentioned below I have no ethical issue with ordering from Rakuten.  When I ordered they marked it low value without me even having to ask.  I think they know we get hit hard with dutiesin order to make ordering from overseas a valid option they have to keep the pricepoint down however they can.  I will say this as well when I ordered from popular domestic stores shipping took  days.  Rakuten my denim was at my door in  days from Japan.  Impressive.,rawdenim,climzum,5,t5_2scl9
2193909,0,t1_cliod5t,I agree that its not hurting the brand value because if I go to Japan and buy them that is the price I will pay. I look at it as  dollar jeans and not the American  price. US retailers are still paying pretty much the same price individuals do and like you said thats an issue of government intervention. But I dont think it devalues the brand. Something like the momomassdrop deal probably would but buying jeans at the price the company says to sell them for isnt a devaluation as much as it seems to be a proper valuation. ,rawdenim,clip7b0,2,t5_2scl9
2200987,0,t3_2kb1f6,Many of the shops we buy from on Rakuten carry brands you wont find otherwise and many shops sell brands you can buy stateside at much lower prices. Many of us are college students who dont make a lot of money Im not going to spend extra to find an alternative retailers for denim when the sellers I do purchase from are doing nothing wrong. I wont stop using craigslist and eBay because there are a few people selling stolen goods so Im not going to avoid Rakuten because of a few people selling ivory. The poachers will still find a place to sell it regardless. I dont want to hurt businesses I love because of the site they choose to host their online storefront. Id rather support them for providing alternatives to the stateside retailers with greater variety and lower prices. I understand what youre trying to do but denim is such a niche market that all it will do is hurt retailers and boycotting them to make a statement about ivory wont make a noticeable impact in Rakutens profits at all. Also Rakuten hasnt allowed the sale of whale meat for a few months now. ,rawdenim,cljlldf,11,t5_2scl9

But I did things like use a spray bottle to semisoak the top block and then wear them around the house normally to stretch them out. It did take a while. Alternatively I took an old toothbrush and dunked it in water and brushed it against difficult to reach spots or just spots that I thought needed a more precise amount of water for stretching. After a little while they stretched out. Perhaps I made it too complicated and just wearing them was what stretched them out but whatever I did worked for me.

Ill go there for chainstitched hems but definitely not another pair of jeans.  Robin is super nice as well as Erik the owner everyone else I met seems a bit more hipster than thou.  They didnt really seem to get that I know what Im talking about when it comes to denim I guess they are used to a bunch of denim virgins coming by the shop.

2758097,0,t3_2rntex,I finished my seasonal employment last weekend. Related thoughts from my experience Most people wont buy    jeans unless theyre on sale and theyre usually taken out of a transaction if they come up at full price. Some qualities arent that unique. We carried overdyed Diesels lefthand and broken twill True Religions and plenty of different warpweft combos like indigoindigo greyblue blackblack. Most were predistressed though and anything more than oz was rare.   I had to refer people to Club Monaco if they needed a  inseam because they carry sixteen and were the only brand I knew of in the mall that had a  inseam. A few people were disappointed to find out we only had   and  inseam jeans and some carried an expectation that wed have everything in between. Some brands dont have separate UPCs for inseam length so there was no way of guaranteeing theyd receive the inseam they wanted if they ordered the jeans through us.  ,rawdenim,cnhl27d,3,t5_2scl9

The rival sniper subplot was pretty unnecessary and fictional I believe and I feel like it was too blackandwhite for a movie about a morally questionable figure in a controversial war.

I can say with  certainty you will not want to size up because theyre pretty heavily vanity sized somewhere between  and  sizes down is normal depending on how tight you want them and how that particular batch runs.  Keep in mind they stretch like crazy not being able to button the top two buttons will require a belt to not fall down after a couple months.  APCs are very weird jeans that being said they fade better than almost any other brand imo.EDIT just reread your post I didnt catch that youre new to raw denim I think NampFs might be a better starting pair just because of how easy APCs are to screw up size wise.  If you do decide to go the APC route do lots of research and try to get a handle on how to size them and go and try on multiple pairs before you buy.,rawdenim,coe0kg1,1,t5_2scl9

3082555,0,t1_coh85sg,gt America is still a really young country. We dont quite have our aesthetic down. American manufacturing doesnt imply any particular attention to detail yet. It just means that the labor was likely more expensive than other brands.gt Japan has a style of their ownthey know what they like and theyre committed to heritage manufacturing. This means that when you buy a MiJ paireven if its from an unfamiliar new denim company you can make some assumptions about what youre getting. You can be virtually guaranteed that the design decisions were considered with some level of care.Im very confused about this statement. Jeans in Japan were brought in wholesale from America. The machines they use to make denim are also often taken from America to be fair we didnt want them any more. Hell repro brands often do their best to exactly copy various  cuts. So I think its unfair to say that there is nothing behind the phrase American manufacturing. The population boom of a century was fueled by American manufacturing. The other criticism I have with this is that there are still hideous awful jeans coming out of Japan. Badly made and poorly designed jeans are not unique to the United States.Obviously things are different now since the US moved out of manufacturing and the modern phrase MiUSA means little. but I think to say that American manufacturing doesnt imply any particular attention to detail is unfair to a whole huge part of this industrys history.,rawdenim,cohi6tw,12,t5_2scl9

As for tightness that is what you should expect from any raw denim brand new especially heavyweights.  It will stretch out to be fine but it is up to your comfort level.  If you feel this one is too tight we can try a different denim.  Something like sixteen STx or Rogue Territory Dark SK would be lighter weights and fit your physic well.

I tried these in a  waist onewash but found the thigh and knee too small initially. I then tried the XX in a  waist one wash but these were a bit roomy through the seat straight up so would end up baggy after stretching. Trying to decide whether to size down to a  in the  but worried they may still feel a little roomy being a slimstraight without any taper.

3284228,0,t3_2xp0th,Hi all  new to raw denim and was about to buy some UB as a starter pair but saw a thread that recommended these which are on sale.A little gun shy over sizing. My reference pair are s which are  smaller in the thigh knee and opening than these. I want a slightly looser fit but will these be significantly looser? Also I plan to do the . oz because I live in TX but would the  oz wear significantly better?Hopefully this is the right place for this question.,rawdenim,cp2mn4w,1,t5_2scl9
3288088,0,t3_2xsx2f,This is going to be hard to get honest answers for. Id like to believe that exclusivity has nothing to do w my interest in the brands i wear but I dont think thats totally true. I have what I think are good reasons for owning the pairs I do but as someone pointed out in one of the threads yesterday I think it would also bum me out a lot if at ton of freshmen stealing the example all due apologies to freshmen started wearing Momos. Its a shitty way to feel  but I think it probably obtains for a lot of us let me know if im overstepping w that claim. Its probably the same feeling as liking a band before everyone else whether or not its true when things become fads it feels like it cheapens your feelings toward something you care about. Exclusivity also isnt a bad thing. The raw denim market right now has great options at every price point precisely because higher prices leave room in the market for companies w lower overall prices. Does it mean that not everyone can own a pair of TSG? Probably. Does it also mean that brands like NampF Gustin and Lawless w all caveats can market to people who arent ready to take that plunge but still want to try the hobby out? Definitely. ,rawdenim,cp32gwz,21,t5_2scl9

Mostly though the fit was a little better in the thighs. Ive checked sixteens measurements before and they always seemed like theyd be too loose but these were just right.

3810633,0,t3_342i80,Okay I slacked off some and here is a larger album to attempt to make up for it.First up the IHJ jacket. I always loved the look of that jacket and finally after several days of measuring and comparing different sizing suggestions its a very closefitting jacket and Im personally not one to go into a store and try on their stock if I know Im ordering from online but to each their own I took the plunge ordering a XXL. I lucked out and I love the way this fits. Especially with the hoodie more about that below I can layer it on top of a tshirt and a flannel and took both new garments through their paces in a trip to Montreal and Quebec this past February and they both performed admirably. Id recommend the jacket to anyone that likes the styling of it. Anyone familiar with Iron Heart knows their black jackets come in their Superblack dye which will not fade. Not that I was against any fading but I knew I wanted black so that was a nonissue for me. I love everything about this jacket from the tight weave to the zippers on the cuffs to cinch everything shut. Honestly my only qualm I might have with the jacket is that I cannot really comfortably zip it up all the way to the top ad use the button. But I have a neck that measures  so anyone familiar with that would probably get why Im not really faulting Iron Heart for how it fits me. And its really not a problem for me since the only time Id want to zip it up all the way anyway Id honestly probably rather use a scarf and tuck that in to the jacket.The Loopwheeler took a bit of convincing as far as the SO was concerned.  for a hoodie?? Yes and I love everything about it. Its the first hoodie I have that is so slimfitting and the only one Ive ever even tried on with the high neck. After having experienced it though. I will likely try to go this route with every other one I purchase. I love how warm this thing is. Even though its not nearly as heavy in weight as a hoodie I have thats lined in fleece I still feel like it goes toe to toe in terms of the warmth it provides. Everything feels solid and reinforced like this hoodie could last me a decade. Im already looking at their stock for the next loopwheeled purchase Ill be making.Finally the Doublewoods! I won these during their AMA that they hosted about a week ago. Shoutout to udoublewoodus for a pair of jeans that Im going to love breaking in and wearing everywhere! Ive never had a pair of black jeans before so when they messaged me and told me I won I figured this could be a perfect opportunity to snag a pair! Id recently determined that my Samurai in my flair was my favoritefitting pair I currently owned so I opted to try out Doublewoods Straight fit which matched up a lot in the top block but narrowed a bit more down the legs.Upon arrival I opened the parcel to find the jeans neatly folded in the canvas bag upvotes for the first person calling out the origin of the graphic! with the note tucked into the right back pocket. I love the personal touch and appreciate the evenlittle bit of time that it took for do. I love the construction from the black stitching to the gunmetalaccent metalwork. Really feels like it the composition comes together in a cohesive whole. The one thing I was unsure about was the potential clash of the patch color but I really like the look of the patch itself and I always have an untucked shirt anyway so its really not at all an issue for me. The jeans felt great right out of the bag. Perhaps a bit snug in the top block but with how easily I could button them up button fly by the way I know that wont be an issue after any initial stretch. The waist was a bit larger than the measurements on the websites size chart would suggest but easily within the range the most companies allow for QC so I really dont have any issue there either.Combine all of that with the great and personal approach they gave me and Ill recommend Doublewood to anyone here. I cant wait to get some fades going with that pair. I love the size of their company and the personal touch they gave to working with me. The canvas bag is a really nice touch and while Im not sure theyd ultimately let every customer have free custom screenprinting on the bags I love mine and will definitely use it in the future.It just needs to warm up some here dammit!And as always if anyone wants a detail shot or any other pics feel free to shoot me a message! Hope you enjoy.,rawdenim,cqqn59p,5,t5_2scl9

3888462,0,t3_34zhld,I was recently asked to post these since Warehouse doesnt get much attention around here.There were purchased roughly  years ago from Blue in Green and have been my favorite pair ever since.  The denim has a wonderful texture and fades beautifully.  These were hand washed every few months for the first year or so.  After that point they started to get thrown in the machine with the rest of my laundry.  No set schedule just whenever they felt dirty.The crotch has been repaired a few times and they are due for another repair.  These are semiretired at this point so I am not too concerned.My only complaints would be that the rise is a little low and the stitching threads are all cotton rather than polycore.  I recently picked up a pair of s to replace these which have a higher rise.,rawdenim,cqzio88,5,t5_2scl9

Had an absolutely amazing last few days.  On Thursday these middle schoolers fro m Japan came and visited my universitys campus. They barely knew any English and it was awesome practicing my Japanese in a not so polite setting. It made me even more excited for my study abroad homestay in a few months.  Also later that evening Neil DeGrasse Tyson visited and gave a talk which was absolutely amazing. Hes super funnywitty and blew my mind more than once.        On Friday I went to a Tame Impala concert with a few friends and that was just a great night. Right after that I participated in Relay for Life for the first time. One of the best experiences Ive had recently. Dancing basketball a hypnotist hanging out with friends and of course the actual walking and fundraising itself was amazing. But my favorite part was the Karaoke they set up. My friends and I decided to do Love the Way You Lie by EminemRihanna and when I started rapping the part almost everyone in the gym stopped what they were doing to come watchcheer It was such a cool feeling and I had way more energy than I shouldve it was like  AM. Also there was this cute girl there who lives in my dorm and Id been wanting an excuse to talk with her for a while. Finally talked to her for the first time so that was great too.       And today a few friends and I are going to use the universitys engineer shop to make longboards. So yeah...its been great.     Howre you guys doing?     Edit  TLDR,rawdenim,crc0cp6,7,t5_2scl9

The masses arent morons the people that constantly give this same spew that invalidates any opinion that runs counter to whats available in the market as if whats available is clearly what everyone wants are morons.  You ARE invalidating my opinion by telling megt To each their own but I fundamentally disagree. And I think that the iPhone  and  Plus show that the vast populous disagrees with your opinion.What this says is I understand where youre coming from but youre wrong and heres why.  The fact that nobody seems to understand this logical fallacy is hilarious which is why I keep trolling people about shoving shoe sized phones in their oversized pants.  Do you understand now why this is straight trolling of people who cant understand it doesnt have to be one way or the other?For the record I actually really like the iphone  form factor.  Its a perfect example of having your cake larger screen size and eating it too still being able to reasonably fit in most peoples pockets.EDIT Also I didnt meant to downvote I accidentally the upvote button and thought pressing down would even it out but apparently thats not how that works.

Theyre heavy weight shit is great for how quickly it fades and the low price point to get into raw denim and see if its something you really want to invest time and money into.

For me the deciding factor was that the field I want to pursue practically requires a masters degree. To answer your question I am studying Aerospace Engineering with a focus in Dynamics and Flight Controls. Overall I really like it a lot. The thing about grad school is that you get to focus entirely on the classes that you are interested in and you get to meet a lot of people with similar interests.

People soak unsanforized denim because the fabric has not been initially shrunk so its important to get that out of the way before wearing and washing. If you decide to soak your jeans nothing significant should really happen.Not sure what the clerk told you about an original hem but the general consensus around here is that if youre getting your jeans hemmed dont ask for an original hem. Have the tailor make a new hem. This is what happens when you get an original hem and its especially obvious if you decide to cuff your denim.,rawdenim,cukzxxz,2,t5_2scl9

5010893,0,t3_3jkgy2,questionable quality fit pics hereSo these came in the mail today and guys I am pumped. oz. Chinese TURPAN denim multicolor weft in a pretty classic taper fit.  Im really loving the weight which feels a lot lighter than my  oz greasers and my . oz UBs. Im assuming thats due either to a looser weave or just less insulating air inside since theyre more fitted.I really enjoy the custom hardware and I like the striped texture the colored weft gives the exterior of the denim.  Really looking forward to how pronounced that will become over time.The denim itself is a lot more uniform and less hairy than I anticipated after all I hear about longstaple Xinjiang cotton.  But coming from my super hairy LFNYC pair that change is not unwelcome at all.  Hopefully it will carry less dog hair.Overall Im suuuper happy with this pickup.  The jeans themselves were about  and around  total after proxy fees and shipping from Beijing so in that aspect an absolute steal. eta almost  of this was shipping since I opted for DHL rather than China Post.  DHL got it here within  days or so from pickup  At some point Ill inevitably grab the jacket they make in this fabric and be striped head to toe.If you can tell from the fit pics how does it look to all you tight pantswearers?

5174315,0,t1_cv9mk9v,Its not important at all. People do it because they think it looks better and because chain stitching with the right machine will give you roping twist on the hem.If you dont ever plan on cuffing and if you dont really care about the roping effect then its perfectly fine to get them hemmed at your local alteration places.Personally I find chainstitches to be super coooool because only a few people know how to successfully operate these vintage machines,rawdenim,cv9p17i,3,t5_2scl9

5277877,0,t1_cvmaur5,UBs are a very common starter pair especially their oz offerings. They fade crazy fast and you can really experience what wearing raw denim is like for a fraction of the cost of the higher end stuff.The major complaints about UBs are the tiny pockets and sometimes people have an issue with their fit. If youve got an average body type then its probably a good starting point for you. Another brand thats pretty common as a starter is Naked and Famous. They are the parent company of Unbranded and they offer more fits for different body types. You can often find them on sale for huge discounts never buy full retail for NF so they are a great starting point. I myself have the Naked and Famous Left Hand Twill in weird guy fit. I honestly didnt know what I was doing when I bought them but they turned out to be a great pair of denim. Very well made and the fabric is solid as hell. They dont fade for shit though lol.If i had to start all over again Id go with the UB or UBdepending on how I liked the fit as my first pair.

I use a  ratio.For cold brew where you let it steep overnight in cold water it needs to be a lot more coffee around  with a coarse grind.  is better and gives you a concentrate that you can then dilute to taste.Ratios are by mass not volume.

6405620,0,t3_43f5k3,Its been approximately  months since Ive started wearing the Pronto x PBJ  and I plan to give them their rd soak today so I figured I should post an update.Here they are on their first day PhotosCompared to  months of wears PhotosFabric The oz unsanforized denim was a special new release from PBJ back in Fall . What made them so special was that its the first time PBJ was able to configure their looms to keep the signature slubs and loom chatters of the fabric while going up in weight This was quite innovative in the denim scene since anything over oz tended to be relatively flat in nature i.e. lacking loom chatters. Although mine looks fairly subdued in these photos I assure you that things get much more sandpapery for other lots of the ozs especially in other Pronto Collabs.Fit I purchased the straight leg version similar to  or  because my thighs wouldnt fit nicely into their cigarette slims and because the slims were out of size  anyways. These are very roomy all the way down the leg and makes for very comfortable everyday jeans. Also the extra leg amp knee rooms result in diamondshaped honeycombs! Unfortunately it doesnt match well with nonbaggy clothing and nonoversized boots so if youre into the smart looking slim fits you should probably stick to the cigarette slims.Quality amp Details No complaints so far in  months. No real damage or broken threads yet thanks to their cottonpoly blend threads. Only some abrasion wears at the cuffs but thats to be expected. Ive mostly been sitting on  my ass or walking around the streets of Bangkok  Wisconsin so no real crazy wears. The cow hide leather patch is super thick and durable Its probably the thickest out of all jeans Ive handled except for NampF oz  that shit cray. The Gold Leaf is a beautiful and unique feature which I have only seen in a few other models such as the Pronto Ai collab. The buttons are the standard PBJ nickle with branding in the front and a leaf in the backPhotos Apologies for the quality difference between the two albums. I processed the photo from the  months album to correct for white natural lights whereas in the initial photos I just went with room lighting at night so the color is somewhat off.

Via email you have repeatedly promised to mail the jacket the next day and provide tracking number and have repeatedly failed to follow thru. Frankly I am losing faith in your desire to fulfill your responsibility in this transaction. Please advise as to your intentions. Seller posted tracking number the next day but had he not I would have posted a stronger message the next day.  Just lay down a message path so that if seller doesnt ship your diligence in the matter is documented.  Stay polite but forceful.

7094198,0,t1_d1jcs8k,For me this denim obsession isnt about breaking them infades at all.  Fades happen but they arent the goal.I love the feeling of a crispstarchy new pair of jeans.  I like the uniform color and classic timeless look.  I wear jeans every day to the office.   Once the fades start happening I feel they start to look less professional.  I still love the jeans because they are cozy and broken in but they get deligated to the weekendevening rotation.  This happens enough times and you end up with  pairs in your collection.The other big part is having different fits as someone else mentioned.

8457063,0,t3_4vhsgr,Ill renew with some quickies most wears to leastOni  Love these jeans wore them every day for like a year.  Ive blow out the right knee in four stages with repairs on repairs now.  Ive not worn them in the summer much since that first enthusiastic year at oz they can be a little much on a hot muggy day.  Hemmed at local tailor Ive worn them uncuffed for most of their life but have put one in recently as they have umm.. gotten longer?   Sugar Cane oz Summertime  These have been a causal goto for me since the day they came in.  In a perfect world they would be a size smaller since I purchased these at the peak of both fat phase and they stretched quite a bit.  Good looking and easy wearing Ive patched the right knee a couple times and had the stitching replaced in a back pocket and the rear centerline.  The stitching is the least durable of any jean here and if you look close there are lots of little pull out spots.   This has been a feature since day one and has gotten more pronounced with age.  That said Ive more than gotten my dollar for them and am just enjoying the ride now. Naked and Famous  Dirty Fade Selvedge weird guy  First pair of raws I purchased a birthday gift card a couple of years ago.  Wore on two short tours with my band where they when from new to worn FAST.  Only pair of pants few showers hauling gear playing shows and parties.   I honestly dont like the fit at all the weird guy rise doesnt feel good to me.   Had I tried them on at a store I would have never purchased.  That said as I broke them in and got used to them I found myself really enjoying the breakin process at the raw lookfeel which started me down the dark path. Pockets are a touch shallow makes me feel less manly. Roy  These are the best all around jean Ive owned.  The attention to detail and craftsmanship is so stupid good It feels absolutely wasted on me and perhaps even jeans.  On top of that the fit is great.   These have been an office jean for the bulk of their life to date but are starting to get a little wear on them now... and have had a wash.   Currently seeing  days a week at the office.Momotaro After the experience with the NampF fit I thought I was fat and tried a bigger cut.  The fabric is amazing but I feel like Im wearing JNCOs.  They mostly sit in the closet except when Im feeling daring but still have a couple hundred wears at this point.  I love the finish and love to touch these jeans with my hands as the denim is think dense rich and slick.  and even as someone who normally hates labels I somehow find the battle stripes endearing.  Would buy again in a slimmer cut.   Eternal Started life as an office jeans last year and are still pretty new looking.  I like the fit very much and the fabric is very rich in color a tad rough and holds shape a little.  Very well finished and I like wearing them.  Currently seeing  days a week at the office.  Noble  BlackGot a gift card to the Noble online store from my sisterinlaw and decided to try some black jeans.  I like the color but feel a little awkward sometimes so they dont get worn that often maybe  times a month in the office.  The jeans themselves seem very well made and the fabric is a very dense and slick weave closest to the Momotaros than anything else.  The cut is basic with a medium rise. ,rawdenim,d5yo1qj,8,t5_2scl9

8953144,0,t3_52x3zc,If you want a snug fit after stretching and its a fabric thats known to stretch a lot like unbrandeds . oz or APC then typically you want to be able to do all but the top button when you first get them. Only the top button should be left unbuttoned if you expect them to stretch. If you want a more roomy comfortable fit its okay for the top button to close either completely or just barely or if its a fabric that doesnt stretch much. Youll need a belt for sure if you do the latter.So not being able to do any of the buttons means that the jeans are too small. Try measuring a pair that fits well in the waist like this check the measurements on the item you want most online retailers have this chart and round down to the size below your pants measurement if not another inch down. For example the jeans you measured are . across the top. The chart for the new pair says size  measure . and  as .. Youd probably want a  in this scenario for a closerskinny fit cant do top button until it stretches out or size  for a roomy conservative fit top button makes the jeans snug but you can button it. It will still stretch to need a belt. ,rawdenim,d7o18wn,2,t5_2scl9

They looked like a stack of crepes. I kept it like that for about a month. Then last night i decided i didnt like the way they look so i ironed them out.

9330815,0,t3_588zs9,. I love raw denim because of the quality of the jeans and how much personality you can interject into it over months at a time. Not to mention the feeling of breaking in a new pair and how accomplished you feel once theyre fitting to your liking. Plus the craftsmanship from knowing someone handmade them..

9345020,0,t3_588zs9,Wow what an incredibly generous offer!And the timing is really crazyIm really interested so this may be a bit long but here goes.. Why do you like raw denim so much?Im not sure I do to be totally honest. I havent had enough experience with it to really fall in love with it yet. But I will try to explain the reason I love the idea of it.Not long ago at age  I had to pretty much start over. Divorce job loss health issues with my kids left me pretty hard up financially. This isnt a sob story Im a resilient bastard and I was never really worried I knew I was in better shape than a  lot of people and Id dust myself off and climb out but heres what was philosophically difficult for me.All of a sudden everything in my life was transitional and disposable.  Ive always been leery of mass consumerism and the direction manufacturing has taken to faster cheaper throwaway culture where everything has an expiration date far shorter than its previous life expectancy and things are meticulously designed to break after an increasingly shorter time frame so were forced to buy it again. Now I aint cheap but I am broke. Theres a difference. I needed furniture and clothes and appliances so you do what ya gotta do.Im on the way back now and slowly shedding the throwaway lifestyle piece by piece. It started with an old thrifted safety razor. Its older than I am. Itll be what my son will uses when he shaves for the first time.Than a dining table from a barn loft built in . I helped a buddy take the barn down he built me the table in thanks. He gave me a little extra to build the bench. Now Im on the hunt for good denim. I know it wont last forever but something with a little Morphic Resonance   I like shit that tells a story. I got lots of stories.. Im a chef by trade its probably my only redeeming skill. I volunteer teaching inner city kids how to cook healthy affordable and easy meals. I started doing the food for it out of my pocket or with extra from chef friends places but I have Sponsors that help with a lot of it now. I used to do it once  week but had a friend ask me to run the same thing with her group of autistic kids so now I do both so its one every other week for each. I do soup kitchen stints for the holidays when I cant see my kids.I dont do this for them though really. Its  for me. I wont ever make a ton of money to leave to anyone. Ill hopefully have some small things that have more sentimental value to leave my kids after Im gone. I wont have be in any history books and they wont name a library after me. But I CAN have a legacy. The only way for me to do that is to have a positive impact in a meaningful way on as many people as I can. And really I need balance. I smoke and drink and swear and get pissed at people that drive in the left lane for no good reason. No one has ever said Hes such a nice guyIm a little rough around the edges. So when no ones looking when I dont have to worry about tarnishing my rep as a hardassI try to do nice things for people.FML that was a lot. Thanks for the opportunity and the therapy session.,rawdenim,d90jqwa,1,t5_2scl9

I have APC Petite Standards .oz NampF Weird Guy Elephant  Revenges oz NampF Weird guy Indigo oz and had a pair of Unbranded UB . oz until the tailor I took them to lost them thats how I got the APCs for free.Most of APCs jeans have a slimmer fit and are definitely my slimmest fitting jean. With that being said the quality is definitely the highest of all of my jeans. As far as the NampF go I like the fit of my oz more than the ozs but I think Ill grow to like the elephant  revenges more as I break them in and get them tailored. The NampF actual denim and fades is my favorite of my jeans mainly the elephant s. The unbrandeds were my favorite fit of all of the jeans though. The quality isnt up to par with the others but the quality isnt bad by any means.They all have something that stands out about them but I think the unbrandeds were my favorite and the apcs are my least favorite. Fit is the most important factor to me which is why I preferred the UBs. I really want to try a pair of NampF skinny guys cause I heard its similar to the s. I also want to try the UBs which are oz.,rawdenim,dbqappp,1,t5_2scl9

Ive since found there are other places you can get better quality for way less. I mean I have a veg tan natural leather belt and veg tan natural cardholder from Tanner Goods and even though I got them on sale they still cost more than higher quality products from other places.For instance I got a bridle leather belt from Thirteen Leather for  on sale. The Tanner Goods belt was  on sale the buckle isnt removable like on the Thirteen and its not even bridle leather its veg tan tooling leather. I recently got a Thirteen Horween Chromexcel natural bifold on sale for . Again the Tanner Goods cardholder I got was on sale for  is only veg tan tooling leather and is way smaller in size. Looks like Thirteen is have a  belt sale right now too. I cant recommend their stuff enough. Another good company Ive heard of is Orion Leather I know they do sales regularly as well.
