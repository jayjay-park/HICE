7928142,0,t1_d476pf9,Usually people who uses DD Frontliner like Gangbi Kaho etc. uses either  Life Rune or  Evasion Rune and with  Attack Rune or with Vampire if you haveand uses either Double HP or Double Evasion as main stat  it would be I HP II ATK III Evasion IV HPEvasion for their survivability and if you do use a DD FL You need tons of CC to back them up too CMIIW IMO,lightfellowshipofloux,d4774nx,1,t5_3eg43

8432379,0,t3_4v55lm,No need to worry about end game raidsrunes. Raise a core team. Core team team to run the easiest raid Kraken. Read up on core heroes on raid guides. Some of them like Hellen would be what you call core since you can use her in all raids.Once you have picked out members for your core team raise them all to  asap. Runes doesnt matter yet just use whatever you have. Start doing raids once you can do B or B farm runes and move forward.,lightfellowshipofloux,d5vl6cm,1,t5_3eg43

9433004,0,t1_d9bo0sg,Youre right I am guessing but my guess is based on playing dozens of these types of games and they all have these fever hot burning checkin or whatevertimes.  Its a time framethey want people to wait for and feel rewarded.  Last event I had already played for a couple hours but then event came and I ended up playing for  hours.  Usually during these events the server gets more populated and you encounter chatter from people you dont normally see since they play during different times then you.  I usually play pmpm EST and its the same people that are on CH.  These event times run pmam for me so I start seeing different players.What youre asking for is a Key XP Gold booster similar to what they have in Summoners War which I would greatly prefer as well.  I dont think they will give it but maybe like  Knights they will.,lightfellowshipofloux,d9bp5lq,1,t5_3eg43
9603620,0,t3_5chp3p,HiIt is advisable to spam keys on farming to get premium scrolls. Even if you might not get  scrolls for .k gems you still get lots of rewards.I havent done the math but I think it is close to  premium scrolls by spamming .k gems.,lightfellowshipofloux,d9wucgo,2,t5_3eg43

10106630,0,t1_dbokbxf,So would the Grade you give them correspond with a value. Such as SSS  .. If so why not just use the Values? Also I like this idea I was thinking about it the other night.

10472319,0,t3_5pwmq4,ive been playing for about  weeks now and to give you an idea of my progression so far  zemer blith jenia lin akurel ardo serena zenon ramia  peishan ereth rene hellen carmen floria vern siho notable  benechia oswald hwa ryun tower normal  tower hard  arena offensedefense  silver zemer serena lin akurel zenon. yolo comps always net me the most wins kraken  run  success rate blith lin jenia peishan ardo. blith gt zemer for this raid hands down. occasionally peishan dies at the boss but the run would still be successful.  other raids im working on other raids. currently tier  for alli rarely use floria even when i first started playing. carmen was my only healer up until i pulled ardo who is now my primary healer for all contents. akurel is a very solid monster for both pvp and pve. ive used him in every floor for tower nh arena and guild wars.my suggestion is to work on ur kraken  team. you cant get enough of those vamp runes. something along the line with blith jenia lin floria  another support if u feel ur runs are a bit shaky or a dps who has heal block not a total necessity but would increase the clear time.,lightfellowshipofloux,dcv58ks,1,t5_3eg43

10829685,0,t1_ddvs9py,I dont really know. I have been farming Bs for a fair while even before the update and if anything have noticed an improvement in drop rates but not enough samples to make a proper conclusion.It could be possible that the rate of Prems from lower floors have been reduced like you said. Perhaps wait and see how CU replies to your post on their forums.,lightfellowshipofloux,ddx07qu,1,t5_3eg43
10923318,0,t3_5w1t1m,This is poorly worded. What they mean is Creates a shield with  chance whenever you use a skill. The shield absorbs the physical damage by  of the Attack Power for  sec then disappears.,lightfellowshipofloux,de6nx6d,3,t5_3eg43
