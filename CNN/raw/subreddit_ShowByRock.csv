4068097,0,t3_375ofc,Im starting to feel the disconnect between Plasmagica and ShinganCrimsonZ more now. Id really like it if they actually interacted with one another because it almost feels like two different shows.Anyway ep.  and  titlessummaries.,ShowByRock,crjzpaj,1,t5_37uim
4348178,0,t1_csfiwnt,Im not super into VK stuff actually haha. Shingans the best band personalitywise though   The fourth CD in this order was AKBs Bokutachi wa Tatakawanai shameThe Marie Ueda album actually came with a Shinimonogurui sticker which I was pleasantly surprised about! Shinis my favorite. Ive been listening to her enough on her youtube channel that I thought I should probably support her in actuality.And thanks! I managed yet another... blue SSR but the second ticket pulled through! I guess past me was right in getting the Tsurezure single.,ShowByRock,csfrseq,1,t5_37uim
4516740,0,t1_cszw7es,Normally the next event will either be the color that hasnt had an event in the longest time which in that case was yellow or the one that hadnt had one in the second longest amount of time red. But sometimes they reset the order completely which is what they did with this purple event.So I have no idea what the next color could possibly be.,ShowByRock,cszz9ew,1,t5_37uim

5396311,0,t1_cw181b3,Currently at  in the Point Challenge  in the Score Challenge.

6811099,0,t3_490mdc,I dont even mind the Cricri artist much despite their obvious decreasing quality but this is downright unfitting for a band that seems... dark in its own way.

8365661,0,t3_4u1xd4,I love the new tour mode!  I dunno about you guys but I couldnt focus attention on SB  of the time so slowly going through easy songs to tide me over between events always felt like such a slog.
