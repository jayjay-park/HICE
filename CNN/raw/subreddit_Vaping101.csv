297110,0,t3_1xi3xj,starting with a VV is a good idea. Protank  is awesome but as for using in any position you will find that with most tanks if you use them upside down the wick doesnt stay constantly wet which can lead to burnt wicks very easier. But seriously get a protank you wont regret it.As for throat hit I totally feel you on this one. I know for me mg nic is perfect but it might take a week to get used to vape nic as opposed to cig nic it bites different. Menthol will definitely add to it if you like menthol. Personally I have fallen in love with Amaretto juice because it is a darker juice so it hits a bit harder while still being absolutely delicious.As someone who wanted to quit I will say that I wanted something that would mimic the smoke taste but if you give it a few weeks I know I got used to getting my buzz through a different flavor and I have reached the point where smoking analogs just sounds disgusting to me now. I started with nic but still wanted to smoke. Jumped up to mg and then mg and now I look at someone break out a pack of smokes and I could care less because I have my fix it tastes better and at parties I dont have to go freeze my ass off outside,Vaping101,cfbk7vf,3,t5_2xcp6
315405,0,t3_1wvich,I had this issue with my EVOD tank but not with my PT Mini. One time I took the EVOD back to the BampM and the guy put a little extra silicone wick into the coil. Tightened it right up. I think the issue has less to do with the gasket seal and more to do with how much wick is in there and what position it is in. Sometimes the wick also gets turned sideways I dont know how else to describe it and it wont seal against the gasket correctly.,Vaping101,cfdgls0,1,t5_2xcp6
351912,0,t1_cfh8b21,Almost all ejuice youll buy comes in a certain mix of PG and VG. This link from the top of this subreddit explains it but basically more PG  throat hit  flavor vs more VG  bigger clouds  high resistance so you can vape at a higher voltage or wattage. The ejuice will say something like  PG  VG.For me personally higher VG concentrations tend to leave a weird taste and sometimes make me nauseous. You can also be allergic. Id recommend getting a sampler pack of one flavor you think youll like with different PG and VG concentrations to see what you like.EDIT added higher resistance of VGYou can also steep the juices for a while several weeks to see if flavorvape improves.,Vaping101,cfh8rjd,1,t5_2xcp6

Also the SVD is telescoping so you can use alot of different batteries but between the pen and the tank i got my set up for  bucks. . for the SVD and . for the PT. Also DIY is never bad i see where you would be interested. before you go that route try a decent juice vendor i personally love thevaporchef.com. TVC is just high quality all around i just got a  flavor package from his on Saturday and only found  i didnt like. it tasted as they advertised it though just not my flavor. i would recommend Honey Pearry and Strawberry VC Cake. both are very smooth and great All Day Vapes!ill do my best to answer any questions but Im fairly new to vaping myself only on about . months now. my original Ego variable never did it for me till i switched up to this SVD with Variable WattageVariable Voltage. now Im down to  smokes a day from a pack and a half a day for the last  years. its done me wonders i hope this helps you!,Vaping101,cfnaf7t,1,t5_2xcp6

488961,0,t3_1zo337,Another thing to consider is that being that bottom coil clearomizers are gravity fed when the juice level gets down to about  full it is more prone to leaking.  Is your leaking problem happening right off the bat with a full tank or does it only seem to be happening near the end of a tank?Also atmospheric pressure and rapid temperature changes can affect leaking as well.  My BCCs were the bane of my existence this past summer.  Id go from a cool house to outside in the heat and it was gurgle city.  And for the sake of your sanity empty your EVOD before a flight.  I didnt anticipate this and I packed two spare EVODs completely full in my liquids bag.  THANK GOD it was in a bag.  Because they just leaked their entire contents all over everything from the pressure in the cabin.,Vaping101,cfvujwx,1,t5_2xcp6

559032,0,t3_20hjm4,Im always on the road.  I originally bought a Kanger Evod starter kit which had two tanks  batteries and a charger.  Over time Ive added to that  Pro Tank Minis another  mah batteries  more Kanger Evod cartomizers and a small Kanger carrying case.  The night before I fill up all the tanks with different juices and make sure at least two  mah batteries and   are fully charged.  I put the  batteries and  tanks in my carrying case put the other tank on the  and go.  I never have to worry about refilling or losing battery.  I know thats a bit extreme but I just stopped smoking a few weeks ago and the last thing I want is to get caught on the road without and be tempted into a mini mart.I dont know how much you are looking to spend or how long you are driving for at any given time but if you wanted to go cheaper you could do the kanger kit and then just buy  additional tanks. Just be wary that some juices will crack a plastic tank and stay away from those.  tanks  batteries and a charger will go a long way for you too.  The more tanks you have filled the less you have to worry about refilling during the day.  ,Vaping101,cg3thdp,2,t5_2xcp6

788507,0,t3_232n39,Nice looking site!  Im real new to the vaping community as I have finally quit the analogs and just decided to go digital.  As a new vaper one addition Id love to see to your site is the ability to sort or filter products based on compatibility.  Some of this is still confusing for me.  For instance if I were to choose a particular battery say an iTaste VV V. which tanksclearomizers would fit that particular thread should I get a Pro Tank  or Pro Tank  Mini?  I hope that makes sense.  It would just be nice to choose one product and have an automatic filtersuggestions that would let me know exactly which products will fitgo with the choice.  Another addition to your site could be just basic information about vaping differences between products pros and cons for each kind of goes in line with the above suggestion.  I just find that most sites that sell products dont have too much information explaining the differences between each.  It would be nice to have that in one consolidated site where I could read about the pros and cons and then immediately make a purchase.Where are you based out of?

Even if it doesnt actually crack it can get hazey which means the chemicals from the tank are leaching into the juice which of course isnt good.  And some of the really bad tank crackers dont care what type of material its made from glass or quartz is the only thing that can handle them.  I remember a story of a certain root beer flavor that dissolved a polycarbonate tank in like  seconds.Some juice vendors will mention which of their juices are tank crackers that can be real handy when ordering.

2814689,0,t1_cnnbpcl,Higher voltage depending on the device and how high you go can actually mute the flavor.  juice will have more flavor than a higher VG blend but if youre looking for more flavor on top of that try reducing your airflow a little bit. The vapor will be more dense and you should have better flavor but it will stiffen the draw of your tank. Rebuildable drip atomizers can be build to offer a lot of flavor as do rebuildable tank atomizers but when that would be more if you were looking to shop around for a setup more geared towards flavor chasing. ,Vaping101,cno0tja,1,t5_2xcp6

I heard and believe in hindsight that the hacking was my lungs clearing out the coal residue from smoking.This was compounded by a common normal reaction to vaping which includes some white phlegm and a sore throat. It cleared in about  weeks although it felt like longer.What helped me was adding some cardio into my life which for me is the best measurement of lung function and I was concerned. Ive trained for marathons as a smoker so I have a good idea of what to expect and I must admit that training while vaping was way easier.I drip now on an RDA  months into vaping and inhaling clouds fit for beyond the troposphere so Id expect my lungs to be heavy but its still easier for me to run on the insane amount of vaping I do now versus the  packday I used to smoke.If youre really concerned maybe give everything a break for  weeks and grab some mg Nicotine patches to get you through it.

Most people that used these had a hard time keeping off of cigarettes but those of us that did had a long an expensive road of better products that we bought. Granted I know people that have been vaping years and still love using the type of starter kit that you posted. Honestly i would say an eleaf istick or an mvp is the best bet. They are durable and have a great battery life. As fart as what to put on top I have been dripping for a long time and using RDAs . Not really sure if that is something that you want to invest in but if you see the old  bridgless atomizers they are great for testing out flavors and to see if dripping is something you want to try.

So with variable wattage devices they read the resistance of your atomizer and use the Ohms law equation to calculate the proper voltage to use for the watts that you set it at.  Since you are setting the volts on the ProVari you need to do the calculation yourself  thankfully theres a website for that That is a great calc just enter the resistance and desired wattage and it tells you how many volts to run.  So if you would like to run the . ohm coil at  Watts  thats . Volts.  Hope that helps!  That calc is a great tool for everything vape related  you can also enter various different voltages with the . ohm coil and see how many watts that translates to.. play around with it.

Im not too interested in building my own coils at least not now and I dont think I will be for a while. I just dont know which resistance I would rather get for the pack itselfI can get . ohm coils in the pack or ....do you think I could just wait until I get the Subtank try both the . and . ohm coils and then order the pack based on what works better for me? Or is the . most likely a good idea to order for now?And I didnt realize VW devices wouldnt fire or warn if its not safeif its dangerous so thats reassuring. Thanks!,Vaping101,crscil8,1,t5_2xcp6

4348228,0,t3_3atg5q,Ok youve got a classic ego spinner style battery or Mod.  To charge it you unscrew the tank and then screw the end of your mod onto the round part of the charger.  Then you plug the other end into a usb port or a usbwall adapter sold separately apparently  I dont know about the charging times so I cant help you there.I dont know that tank so Im going to take an educated guess but I could be wrong.  It looks like a bottom coil burning unit of some sort with an air control which is kinda neat for a less expensive tank  making an assumption forgive me.What I would do is this.  Take the tank by it self.  Turn it upsidedown so that the tip the part you put in your mouth is facing downwards.  Grip the mod by the black part with one hand and the silver part at the very top  where it connects to the mod normallyGently twist the silver part counter clockwise.This should seperate the tank from and give you access to the inside.  Looking in you should see a chimney running from the tip up through the center.  When you add more juice add to just below the level of this chimney.  If you go over it it will leak down onto whatever is under the mod and youll get juice in your mouth next time you vape yuckThats guesswork but I hope it helps.,Vaping101,csfrzpd,8,t5_2xcp6
4474986,0,t3_3cdyds,I believe the Vision Spinner  has about a . amp limit.  So at its lowest setting i believe . V the coil has to be at least . ohms. Amps  VoltsOhms.  The chip in the battery should cut you off if you try firing it with a coil with lower resistance.If youre going to invest in an RDA youre definitely going to want a new battery.  There are some cheaper options out there but youll want something with at least W maximum the Vision Spinners cant go above W or so I think.If youre looking at upgrading you can either go with a mod where you have to purchase the batteries separately and they are removable or something like an iStick or MVP battery is built in.,Vaping101,csuqrfi,2,t5_2xcp6

5315405,0,t1_cvr3cpl,Hey no problem! The eGo ONE has an internal battery that charges via MicroUSB on the mod. The other devices also confusingly referred to as batteries more commonly mods or boxes need an external battery with an  form factor like Samsung Rs or Sony VTCs and can be charged inside the device also using MicroUSB or with an external charger. I prefer external s because theyre replaceable and you can grab a couple and keep a spare one charged so youre not stuck without a vape if you forget to charge your battery.If you go with the ONE youll probably want to pick up some spare coils like the CLR . ohm which have Kanthal wire inside or the CLRTi . ohm which has Titanium wire inside and therefore allows for temperature control. Note that Kanthal wire does not allow for temperature control even if your mod supports it.Those CLR coils also have the benefit of being relatively cheap especially when you consider that theyre able to be rebuilt very easily with any kind of wire you choose official tutorial here or you can just toss them out and replace when they start tasting gross. I think you can even rebuild the CL coils it comes with but that might be more challenging. Im really big on rebuilding because it reduces the cost of vaping for most people significantly making it more likely theyll quit smoking and stick with vaping. I also DIY my eliquid which reduces it further but not everyone is into that. Ive definitely saved a lot of money despite investing in DIY supplies. Certainly more than if I had stayed smoking shisha and pipe tobacco recreationally.The ONE kit is pretty slick all in all people seem to like it. Joyetech used to have a bad rap for lack of user support but I havent seen too much negativity in the last while so its probably gotten at least a little better. YMMV but I find that most vaping stuff is a little caveat emptor at this point. Still places like here and recr are nice bellwethers.edit battery yes if needed  but you also need eliquid. ,Vaping101,cvr3t4e,2,t5_2xcp6

5334512,0,t1_cvt26x6,Thanks so much for such a detailed reply. My dad smokes purely because hes addicted. I dont think he gives a damn about the social aspect of it despite the fact that all of his friends smoke too.Basically Im just looking for something that can mirror cigarettes minus all the ash and C crap. I think if I can start him off on whatever dosage of Nicotine and pair it with a flavour that he enjoys having in his mouth then he can watch himself dial the nic dosage  down slowly eventually hell be either vaping for fun  mg might take awhile or hell be happy getting just a small hit when he feels the need.I basically just want to show him that he can get his nicotine fix in a way that is much like a cigarette without the price smokes are crazy expensive in Australia coughing carbon ash stink and mess that they cause. And I can try and appeal to his conscience of  Hey you can get your nic fix without burning holes in your lungs etc. You can pick up your ecig and have a smoke just like youre used to whenever you want. No need to remember your patches and and no need to pay out the ass for them and then just cold turkey smokes altogether.I do plan on educating my dad on how to use the thing and hes not an idiot D My old man is really smart and hes only . But of course the less he has to do to smoke the better as it will more closely mimic traditional smoking without the whole This is so complicated compared to just smoking a fag feeling.Anyway TLDR aside. What do you think about the Kanger Subox Mini would it be anything closer to better in terms of still having the customization options without over doing it?

Dripping and Driving is hard let alone dangerous and has a potential to get juice everywhere. I tried it not easy or fun.

The overall size and resistance of your coil will determine what watt ranges it works best for. For example when Im building an RDA to run on a W box I usually build dual coils to ohm around .. This allows me to get good voltage through it despite wattage limits. If Im building for higher watts  Ill build something like a zipper coil or fused Clapton between .. ohms on a large diameter .mm  mm. That allows me to push it up to  watts and because of the large surface area it wont just burn at those power levels. In a nutshell the more watts you want to push through the bigger your coils need to be both in width and length.,Vaping101,cx4lo60,1,t5_2xcp6

Youve heard right about the Nautilus Mini but if you want hookahtier vapor youll just move on to subohm after a while. Also theres the taste to consider. Being able to vape at higher watts subohm does wonders for the flavor.Kanger Subvod Kit  Cant find info on how watts how powerful it is but  mAh means it will drain way too fast for onthego vaping especially on subohm which drains more.Kanger Subox Mini Kit  Excellent choice possibly cheaper at other vendors. I recommended this one to my boss and a workmate and theyre happy with it. Another variant is the Subox Nano Kit which I got my girlfriend. A bit smaller.Vape King Deluxe Starter Kit  Like the first one but with worse tank. The Nautilus Mini is probably the best nonsubohm tank available so this one is a downgrade.You want vapor and taste you get the Kanger Subox Mini Kit. Im by no means a veteran vaper but I do know some stuff. You seem serious about this and willing to learn. I see that youve already made an effort to learn about PGVG for example. One rule of thumb is the higher watts you push the more vaporflavornicotine effectwarmth youll get and the lower resistance for the coil youll need.

The tank has that sump at the bottom so I guess it collects there first.I asked them to replace it with the black version as I saw that had differences such as a glass inner drip tip so hopefully it also has some changes that fix the leaking issues of its silver brother.,Vaping101,czjxmvv,1,t5_2xcp6

It has really simple TC and power mode. Goes up to W and can run coils down to .ohm. Doesnt support stainless steel coils tho but innokin will do something with it hopefully. The only disadvantage would be integral battery however its not a problem for me I can solder a new one easily and this battery lasts really long between charging! I can vape for  whole days and I vape quite a lot on around WComes with iSub G tank  gives really good flavour and decent clouds and its freakin leakproof.

7348697,0,t1_d2ddch4,cecyvapes your heart is in the right place and youre showing that you do care about safety  but you dont know what youre talking about.In regards to tanks on mechs as long as its a normal  then its perfectly fine and virtually identical to a regulated device.  The issue is when trying to use a hybrid mech with a tank that has a shallow positive  pin.In regards to prebuilt coils most of them have far more power applied to them on regulated devices.  For example a . ohm coil at . volts is  watts Id bet a majority of people exceed that wattage on a regulated mod.  I first saw this line of thinking around the time people tried using Atlantis tanks on hybrid mechs.As for the battery recommendation its all dependent on the use case and the quality of the battery.  The A portion isnt asking for an explosion the likelihood that hes talking about an Efest battery however is asking for an explosion.Id strongly recommend watching this video Twisted Messes made regarding series box mod safety  While hes primarily talking about the Noisy Cricket almost all of the information can be taken and applied to other mechs as well.,Vaping101,d2dhvue,4,t5_2xcp6

7397752,0,t1_d2ibp4i,I live in China therefore my contacts may not be suitable for you. An excellent resource is Brokevapers.com however I do not know their turnaround time or if they offer discreet shipping.The evic Mini and the cuboid mini are essentially the same as far as function aside from battery. Both units even come with a rebuildable atomizer for the tank. Now the rebuildable is not as good as the notch especially if youre building with a beginners skill level. The cuboid mini however is smaller in size and SEEMS from the naked eye and no long term testing to have a more solid  connector where the atomizer connects to the mod. Furthermore the Cuboid Mini comes with a tank that is the same in engineering and principle but holds much more liquid volume than the cubis that comes with the evic mini. Make sure you are ordering the cuboid mini and not the cuboid. The cuboid is a dual battery mod that is significantly larger in size and NEVER has come prepackaged with a tank. The cuboid mini comes in two retail packages one with just the mod and another with the tank and coils and such.As far as liquids go I would have a hard time recommending vapewild. I havent explored too much of their catalogue but of the  flavors I ordered  were vapeable and  I poured down the drain. I believe there are two budget brands being pushed on recr one by the name of blue dot I think I dont recall the other. I have no experience with these brands but I do have experience with vapewild... However my recommendation here may not apply as I typically gravitate towards more premium liquids and am somewhat of a snob when it comes to this. Quick tip The clean vape has great deals for a certifiable quality liquid and I can recommend their strawberry graham cracker their dr pepper and although I hate it their puffs flavor sells ridiculously well out here. One of the best custard flavors Ive ever had at a competitive price is Moon Mountains Cosmo custard. Their other flavors like their sweet mother lines and also this new... orange marshmellow or whatever is pretty good too and I have no qualms of recommending it. Set down is a unique one and to me doesnt taste like a good key lime so only indulge if you have excess budget.,Vaping101,d2j2qif,1,t5_2xcp6

8088984,0,t1_d4p8z0l,I can certainly recommend the Billow V There might be a V out now too although Im cautious to recommend it as your first rebuildable. I say that for two reasons. Firstly the deck is quite small and you have to build quite small to fit your coils in without shorting on the sides. Secondly wicking is not the easiest if youre new to it you need very little cotton and if you use even the slightest bit too much youll be in dry hit city.If you can get past those limitations it is a great tank. The dual coil deck performs really well.The bottom feed means you can run it right out before refilling.

A  tank most likely holds a lot more juice and is made from glass or Pyrex. They are usually for intermediate to experienced users. Typically a subohm tank will cost around . Subohm is any coil resistance below . and will produce a very large plume of vapor. Hope this is helpful ! Happy vaping ,Vaping101,d7laj55,0,t5_2xcp6

9640271,0,t1_da13rxd,There is no best overall only things that fit your needs better.  None of my iSticks have temperature control but my Vaporesso mini does and it is great.  Your Pico offers TC if my memory is correct so a tank that offers atomizers with TC type coils would be more flexible.  Two of my tanks a Vaporesso Guardian and a Joyetech Cubis both have atomizers with stainless steel coils available.  The Guardians coils are surrounded with a ceramic material which prevents the cotton wicking from burning and the less expensive Joyetech coils do not.  With TC you would not burn the coils anyway.  Most tanks that can use atomizers with stainless steel coils should work fine on your Pico.  Good luck!,Vaping101,da1d18v,1,t5_2xcp6
9648541,0,t3_5d7ccl,Im thinking that maybe youre screwing the tank way too tight to the battery. This causes leaking issues.

There are so many authentic atomizers at an affordable price these days that its crazy not to get an authentic. A clone can be a crap shoot sometimes depending on who cloned it. A few years back I wouldve said to grab that clone and enjoy but now authentic atomizers are priced close to the clones that its just worth it for the reputation of the manufacturer warranty and build quality.

It comes with a silicone plug that allows you to plug up one side and make it a single coil which is how I use it.

11469198,0,t3_63n69d,I have a few tanks for my Pico and I use them for different things. I have the Aspire Cleito which I use for my light fruity juices. I think the . ohm coil w is awesome at anywhere between w with high VG fruity juices. For my custards deserty and coffee chocolatey juices I use the Smok TFV Baby The Baby Beast and have been using the . w coils V BABYT and loving them at w. The only reason Ive been using the T coils is because my local shop was out of the T coils w which I totally prefer because they are a . quad coil design that vapes best between w so I could turn it down a bit and save on juice and battery but still have flavor for days and exceptional vapor production.  having said that the baby beast has no problem with vapor production or flavor with either coil  but I definitely prefer the lighter fruitier juices in the cleito. I also have the new wismec elabo also a mm tank so it will fit the Pico but I havent used it enough to really say if its better yet than the other two Ive mentioned.  I do think the Smok tanks do great with fruity vapes too I got after it with the baby beast using both Nakeds Hawaiian POG juice and a local favorite Vertigos Pink Drink  and both were great experiences. I just think that if youre going to toggle eJuice styles its best to have one tank for the light fruity stuff and another for the thicker custardy ones so you arent pulling such radically different flavors through the same coils whenever you want to mix it up. ,Vaping101,dfw10e3,1,t5_2xcp6

11527066,0,t3_64hjmy,Im about  months cig free and I too had an issue finding my sweet spot. I bought a kangertech kbox and didnt really understand what all the hype was about. Roughly  later I felt like I couldve spent that money on cigs. A year later I decided to give it one more go and holy hell was it worth it. I bought an Smok Alien just like pretty much every other person on this sub and I absolutely fell in love. Being that there are  batteries in this guy I can charge it before I goto bed and chain vape all day no problem. I dont have any extra batteries but I havent needed them yet. I also recently purchased the stick v to take with me to work on construction sites and that guy is pretty amazing too if you dont want a bulky mod in your pocket all day. Another suggestion is along the lines of what the guy above me said about finding what flavor you like... if I could recommend something it would be to order a sample pack from Vape Wild. You can pick something like  flavors for ? I could be wrong on the price but its not expensive. Pick something from any category youre interested in and if you like that type of flavor look for something similar at a local shop if youd like. You can also pick the vgpg ratio for those juices on VapeWild. Aside from that I wouldnt skimp out on buying the right modpenstick... if you really want to quit and get into vaping you have to give it a fair shot with the right equipment.. just my personal opinion anyway. I really wish you the best of luck! It gets easier!,Vaping101,dg2lf3u,2,t5_2xcp6

Replace battery turn device on without atty see what it says. Turn off replace atty turn on. See what happens.,Vaping101,dg34knc,1,t5_2xcp6

11568415,0,t3_6529ec,As a veteran vaper who has the bad habit of buying every single toy that catches his eye using it for five minutes then throwing it in with the rest of the lot I feel especially qualified to answer this question.Almost always it is fine especially if its for a shorter period of time less than a couple of months when you get up to half a year to a year things can start to get a little nasty. Like deck screws might rust  depending on your juice an your screws juice might start picking up off flavors metallic or plastic Depending on the tank.But like i said almost always if youre any sort of sane person itll be fine. I have never had any serious damage to tanks or rdas.,Vaping101,dg7aa70,1,t5_2xcp6
