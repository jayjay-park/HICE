5729827,0,t3_3tltmy,Its because youre more likely to get interference from the power induced into the mic lines. When you run long stretches with AC parallel to the license lines you can wind up with  cycle hum through all of the lines. Especially if youre pulling a reasonable amount of current. This is why every audio book school class and guide say you should run AC at a  angle to any audio lines. ,CommercialAV,cx7ca1n,12,t5_2uhnx
6235341,0,t1_cyycp4g,ok. I have this exact mount installed. this is the one that I am having a problem with. The rotational nut on the back cant be tightened any more than it is but it still doesnt hold position. End user pulls out the display to improve the viewing angle for the room and the display has a very hard time remaining level even though it is level and properly installed. I apologize for the confusion. ,CommercialAV,cyye2gw,1,t5_2uhnx

9375154,0,t3_58yy9c,It could need to be the same resolution because of the limitations of the graphics card. What program are you using? You shouldnt need to ever click on anything on an output screen. An HDMI splitter will work but the cheap Chinese ones will likely cause yet more issues. Andor fail really easily.As for the cable itself... Wow. It needs to be pulled and replaced with either cat  or SDI. To boost it in the middle you are going to have to pull new cable anyway. ,CommercialAV,d94d89k,4,t5_2uhnx

10141266,0,t3_59ipkc,My experiences with working with colleges as a consultant or even just an independent contractor is that I have learned that if the department head wants to get anything done it seems they have to begin by telling those with the purse strings that you need x what you really need to get what you want done. They will ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS balk no matter what amount you originally tell them. So telling them high is smart because then you look like a hero when you can do it cheaper. And relieved that it wont cost as much as they thought. Not to do this as something shady but I have yet to find someone up high that even understands a single thing about anything AV. They are usually the guy that still uses a vcr at home that is still flashing  ,CommercialAV,dbtetjl,1,t5_2uhnx

10649602,0,t1_dddlkjr,So either you need a DSP that handles that if you configure it right shouldnt need that setup of someone listening and adjusting. A good DSP would be like Clearone as you can setup the AGC ALC etc and it will auto adjust and also the interface is simple if you need to remove the AGCALCetc and have it complete manual control through a pc interface.However if you want to go with a mixer and have the control of it all the time then first one before any other product recommendations is  to remove the gentner im assuming it the old dsp that clearone bought as I havent seen any new gentner that only a telco line and just get a simple telco hybrid and connect it to a mixer. For a mixer I kinda like soundcrafts boards since it own by Harman and they have a full line and if you start adding on it easier to get support when it all harman products but I had very little problems. The SI Expression line is nice. It probably more than you need but if gives you digital card capability and lots of audio routing options.,CommercialAV,ddefaag,1,t5_2uhnx
