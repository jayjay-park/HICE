As a topperforming uberx driver in Denver I work very hard to provide my riders with an exceptional service that is well worth the rates currently being charged. The decision to reduce fares to a ridiculously low level not only cheapens the brand it is an utterly insulting admission of the value Uber places on partner uberx drivers. To say that I am skeptical about this actually being financially beneficial for us is a massive understatement.

2643283,0,t1_cn3krsq,It has clearly been the former category. What Uber has done to drivers is essentially a bait and switch. The service started with drivers being paid excellent rates in order to quickly build up a large employee base no one would bother with Uber no matter how great the customer service if it took twice as long to get a ride as a cab. Once they had more than enough people driving they were able to gradually start cutting commissions. Now drivers are nothing but a factor in a costbenefit analysis and they are determined to drive pay as low as they possibly can. Due to the obfuscation of what drivers are actually making since it requires some fairly indepth calculations they can push many drivers below minimum wage or what they would actually be willing to work for without them noticing. Furthermore they have been intentionally deceitful when it comes to how much the average driver actually makes and refused to provide almost any meaningful statistics to back up any of their claims under the guise of driver privacy. Of course this is done to fool people into believing in the Ubermerican Dream that they can be a small business entrepreneur fight against the evil Big Taxi be associated with a hip company and make a cool  figures in the process.  gtwhy would they not have better alternativesThere are plenty of reasons I could think of. And although there are no real qualifications to work at McDonalds but that doesnt mean anyone can walk through the door and be handed a job at any time unlike Uber. Plus Uber doesnt have the stigma that working at McDonalds has. Even though both jobs require just as much brainpower or skill with Uber you are a sleek hip driver for a hip company even if youre actually making less money. Ironically cabbies are probably viewed as even less desirable jobs than food service yet at Uber doing the exact same work is viewed as much better. Because of the fact that just about any entry level fulltime job pays better than Uber and has actual benefits no person who is qualified for and able to acquire such a job would drive for Uber full time.,uberdrivers,cn3lyb7,1,t5_2yzxz

3001511,0,t3_2uj1hh,Software devUberLyft Customer here.One of the biggest steps that UberLyft drivers can take is to DEMAND VESTING STOCK FOR DRIVING. This is absolutely critical. Self driving cars are coming and the CEO of Uber is already planning to fire all the human drivers when the technology is ready  Google owns  of Uber and sees it as an early test bed for their driverless car technology  If it happens in this fashion drivers will lose and the economy will lose when all those people are simultaneously put out of work.So what changes if DRIVERS DEMAND VESTING STOCK? Well first admittedly Uber is far too greedy to ever do this. But Lyft with the right amount of awareness raising on this economic issue and employee exploitation might. And if that happens it means that drivers will accumulate capital even after theyre replaced by automated cars. This is great for them and great for the economy. It also forces Uber to compete for drivers again because fewer would want to drive for them if Lyft is offering vesting stock for drivers.If none of the new transportation companies will share their growth and refuse to stop exploiting drivers drives should recognize that the corporate structure and the owners are the disposable part of the rideshare equation. Look into Tcorporations and cooperatives. Also peer to peer decentralization software. The only critical elements for a ride sharing service are an app and the drivers. It is rather straightforward to build an app that does exactly what Uber and Lyft and Sidecar all do only one that is fully owned and operated by the drivers themselves.Id estimate about  years to do this before the selfdriving cars begin to replace everyone. Remember this Right now drivers build the rideshare companies. The owners are optional.,uberdrivers,co93ru5,1,t5_2yzxz

There are some who have become discouraged and some who feel betrayed. I think they have legitimate strong feelings about it. There are others who are sick of Uberspeak how Uber never directly addresses real issues and the fact that when it really comes down to it they honestly dont give a shit about us even though they constantly pay lip service to us as valued partners.Yes I share some of those feelings. But I still drive for now with the same positive attitude you have. I have concerns particularly about insurance that weigh on the back of my mind. Sometimes just raising these issues is misunderstood as negative complaining.Its different though than hating cuz a haters gon hate. These are real sobering issues that need to be discussed even if discussing them can take the wind out of our sails.Welcome to ruberdrivers.,uberdrivers,cpovu76,7,t5_2yzxz

Is it possible to qualify for the guaratee i.e. not so many drivers you cant get  ride per hour?Some markets you can make  per hour some markets you will struggle to make minimum wage before gas.Its not some drivers are negative and some are not its the markets are so radically different right now.Unfortunately for those of us whose markets were like those whose are great right now and saw them decline from rate cuts and over hiring of drivers we cant help but be skeptical about the future of those other markets.Uber is a great part time job!

General consensus is that the per minute rate is not worth starting and sitting for something like .min combined with the risk of them giving you a low rating.

3844512,0,t3_34aqrt,Theres lots of good comments above so I dont have much to add.  I assume you would be signing up for a bonus... So that should cover the investment you make getting your physical and inspection done.  Then youll have to give probably  rides to qualify for the bonus.  This can be done in about  hours easily depending on when and where you drive.  Consider those first rides as an evaluation period and decide if its right for you.  Some days I meet super nice people have great conversations and explore new parts of the city that I would never otherwise see.  Sometimes but not too often you might have to deal with a dickhead or two people who make you wait or are just entitled or inconsiderate.  Remember that there is luck involved... Sometimes you get good fares sometimes you get get short inexpensive ones.  But your next ride to the airport or across town could be right around the corner.  Youll find what works for you.  Just be careful driving downtown especially LoDo during the drunken hours... Only because the cars on the roads are especially hazardous at that time of night.

Round that up to a penny a mile as well.Gas at gal and average mpg youre looking at .mile. For my hybrid in texas its .gal and mpg average so Im at .mile but well use a more realistic estimate for the sake of argument.So now were up to .mile. Other wearandtear and depreciation can of course be factored in to this.

If its surging x when you want to leave that could cost you double the estimate given in the App estimate tool .Edit There is a special promotion going on right now if you use UberPool option. I Think it should only cost you  from DTLA  LAX. YOu cant have more than  people in your party. you need to be curbside when the driver arrives min wait then he drives off and cancels and you need to give yourself plenty of time as the driver might pick up someone else going the same way to LAX.

Never done sidecar.Its hard to say whats a good spot because you never know where your fares are going to take you. Fact is youre gonna get bounced around LA. The starting point is probably the only way you can dictate a bigger fare. I live in Highland Park so thats a great starting point. Its not near anything fun so most first fares want to go downtown or to hollywood or to weho. So if you can start someone remote thats actually not a bad thing.If youre in a major hotspot DTLA WeHo Hollywood rides are usually not very long but they are frequent. Its not bad but you wont be making great money by trying to stick to the hotspots.Heres my rule of thumb If theres a big surge somewhere near turn off the app and go there then turn it back on. Otherwise park somewhere and just take the first fare you get. The more you are driving the more youre earning. Unless youre somewhere really far away its not worth trying to go to a certain area if I find myself in Montebello and its surging super hard in the west side yea Ill make that trek but otherwise Ill take whatevers going on in Montebello.All that said Santa Monica GlendalePasadena and NoHo typically have the biggest fares because theyre more spacious and people have to travel further. ,uberdrivers,cs35xsg,5,t5_2yzxz

Also because you consider yourself old fashioned and patriotic. The idea that the government should be your daddy is as far away from old fashioned as it gets.

Because money. Companies are not going to filter the water on their own. It was found that these companies would do everything they could to keep their costs down and profits high. This is the kind of thing that happens without regulation.Uber right now is able to do business without the oversight of regulation and theyre making a ton of money. Uber will maintain that drivers are not employees up until the minute that a federal court says they are. Then suddenly there will be k people that are protected by US labor law and regulation.

5305836,0,t3_3no9lc,The business model of Uber is that you the passenger is supposed to be at the indicated pickup location when the driver arrives and youre supposed to get into the Uber vehicle immediately upon the drivers arrival. This is why you get an ETA of the driver upon entering your request a notification that your driver is about to arrive and the ability to see live where your driver is and an ETA countdown. The  minute wait time is purely a courtesy not a right. If youre not at the indicated pickup location when the driver arrives you are holding up the driver from working driving other customers because drivers dont get compensated for waiting curbside for passengers unless the passenger doesnt show up at all after  minutes. This is the business model and there is no reason to be upset. The logic is Uber and Uber drivers work to make money not to sit curbside not making money. Drivers take your request because they assume you will be at the pickup location ready to go. Drivers dont know ahead of time that you will not be ready to go.,uberdrivers,cvpvrgj,21,t5_2yzxz

From customer in the car to exit they have not pushed the try and file on your personal policy first line.  But when you do not have a customer but are still on the app they have.  And in either case there is a  deductable to use the collision coverage.  California made it real clear to TNC  WHile drivers are onthe map there needs to be liability coverage.  They never said anything about collision coverage.  Thats why its a separate policy.  What I was trying to get across is it does not follow if liability is covered so is collision.

6500740,0,t3_44ob3y,if she left it in drivers car its not theft.  why would you file a police report?  any number of reasons it may have been turned off including many honest ones like saving battery until he had time to determine the owner or those which would be the driver protecting their own privacy which would be my concern personally.  basing this solely on statistics Im guessing you didnt tip the driver.  if you had and they are the one who found and turned it off youd probably have a higher chance of getting it back quickly.  I have two too long to share full details stories of lost phones by unappreciative passengers both of whom I went way out of my way to provide over the top service during rides both coincidentally had long wait time before pickup as well as long stops while ride active then wasting over an hour of downtime during highdemand surges returning the phones unpaid again waiting for each of them to come outside.   one of them even set off the FMI ping and buzzing for  minutes while I had other passengers in the car and nobody could reach the phone safely which I had to apologize for.  from that Ive decided its not worth helping them in the future.  if they didnt tip the first time I saw them they almost certainly wont take into consideration the cost of my bringing their valuable phone to them.   I certainly would not have wanted either one of these people being able to find the phone in my car while parked in my driveway and show up at my house or worse send the police making my neighbors think Im some criminal.  honestly if I find a phone and was not tipped by the person who left it Im probably turning it off and flipping it out the window to let fate take it from there.in summary my opinionstip your driver ANYthing  evendont call cops on noncriminal driverdont assume driver doesnt have better things to docompensate driver for their time and expenses for returning phone which is obviously of value to you,uberdrivers,czrq4nl,4,t5_2yzxz

6540417,0,t3_457q5m,Youre asking the right questions and taking the right approach unlike some people. Uber is used more but I prefer Lyft for better commission and tips. But you should sign up for both to have access to more customers. And get sign up bonuses for both. Sign up bonuses are the best money you can make.. No. Youll just have to accept that whenever you are done for the night you may have a long commute home. But it will almost always be the Southland. Those trips to Vegas or Stockton or whatever are quite rare and you dont have to take them. Lyft may have a directional option but is restricted to using once a day? Its an Im on my way home feature.. Get a hands free mount bottled water at Costco .bottle plus CRV and some mints. I also have blue emesis vomit bags and two portable dustbuster type vacuums If choosing one the Shark is where its at. But I keep them both because the ArmorAll is wetdry and has a cord. I have them in my trunk in a flat back bucket secured with bungee cords.. Youve already figured it out. Yes you can call. But also youll see that the GPS is usually very accurate. Drive to the dot and there they are. Meanwhile take a trip or two just to see what its like from the customers vantage.Do read up on the risks and horror stories especially realistic pay. Youre not going to be making much more than hour unless you can do some good bar work midnight to AM on FriSat night.What type of car do you have? Fuel efficiency is obviously very important. And youll need to budget for accelerated maintenance oil changes tire rotations and repair brakes tires costs.There may be long slow periods so hopefully you can have homework and reading to do during your down times. The gig can be ideal for a student because you can study then work as the pings roll in. And if you get really absorbed in your work you can always log off. Like I said youre approaching this smartly. There are lots of idiots out there driving for Uber and Lyft which puts you ahead of the curve.,uberdrivers,czvtyzt,1,t5_2yzxz

At a later point whether its that you have reached a threshold for total number of trips cancellation rate whatever the app will then log you off and give you a timeout of between  minutes and an hour.There is no way to understand why Uber does this unless you just accept the company line that Uber does this because it loves you and wants you to make more money just like when Uber cuts the rates in your city.,uberdrivers,d1w5gph,6,t5_2yzxz

7351775,0,t1_d2dsbdr,I dont consider myself cheap I tip a flat  at all restaurants and I tip the customary amount for other services. I dont vary my tip based on my perception of service quality since Im familiar with the research that such perceptions may be unconsciously biased against people of color older women and other demographics. I share feedback via relevant mechanisms e.g. Yelp Uber etc. or directly with staff in extreme positive or negative cases.That said I strongly prefer to eat at restaurants that have replaced tips with an automatic service charge or higher menu prices nearly  have done so I also prefer Uber over Lyft since they deemphasize tips which enables them to charge higher fares in important markets like SF and pay higher base rates. I prefer tipfree services because of numerous studies showing that tipping is not only discriminatory but creates unhealthy power dynamics contributing to sexual harassment and corruption and that tips are nearly uncorrelated to service quality itself.What differentiates Uber from the restaurant market is that Ubers prices are highly dynamic varying considerably by geography over time and in real time surge. That is they respond to supply and demand. Drivers already make decisions on how much to drive based on expected total earnings including tips. If tips rise driver supply will rise which will allow the Uber platform to reduce prices in a locale or reduce surge pricing.These price reductions wouldnt be solely due to tips just as many forces influence Uber to make these changes today. The difference is forces that apply today affect all drivers equally where tipping benefits white drivers more than black drivers. My guess is that drivers overall may earn more for a few months but within a year Uber will either reduce base prices or reduce surge such that average earnings will be the same as they are today but whites will be better off while blacks will be worse off.,uberdrivers,d2duhn2,1,t5_2yzxz

7839587,0,t1_d3x7020,If you drove for Uber for k miles in one yearXChange would have cost you    Or  cents a mileWhich includes all maintenance complete ownership of the car.  Everything except insurance and gas.Prius would be  cents a mile in gas Corolla  cents.Insurance three cents.So  cents a mile all expenses.  And youd still get to use the standard mileage deduction of  cents.  So  after expenses would be completely tax free. No SET no income tax nada.Its a cheaper per mile cost than many of the omg I cant make any money whines on this forum by people driving cars totally unsuitable for Uber.XChange isnt targeted at everybody.  That XChange is not the best possible option does not mean it is preyingEdit I just looked it up.  A prius lease is month plus  cents per mile over  miles.  The term is for two years.So at k a year thats k miles or a  penalty. Plus  for a total of  for two years.  XChange would be  for those two years.  Except the traditional lease does not cover maintenance after k miles.Verdict XChange is a superior financial deal than a traditional lease for anybody working Uber full time.Its math folks.,uberdrivers,d3x8jzd,9,t5_2yzxz

It is weird and since I know that area very well I just stopped using navigation in that area.  Just FYI... Neither the uber nor lyft app have navigation they open the default navigation app on your phone then when you arrive they switch back to the respective app.  So what you were seeing on their phone is not what their nav app told them.  FWIW because of this I now switch back to the rideshare app before reaching the end just so I can see where the pin actually is.

8664309,0,t3_4yl1ch,This would get not get much more than an eyeroll and a star deduction from me.What you have to understand about signs like this being put in the face of a captive audience is that they are going to read it over and over and over and over during their ride. The more they read it the more they will pick it apart and find things to be annoyed with. You dont want that.Keep it simple.  Three bullets tops. On as small a sign as possible.  Drop the Muay Thai thing drop the personal vehicle thing drop the five star thing. If you must put up a sign you want something that they can read understand there is a two way interaction going on for their comfort and then ignore.    I already know your name The audio video notification is nice I guess but creepy the way you have it here. I had a driver once that just had this little button that said AudioVideo recording in progress!! It was cute and probably the least creepy way to let passengers know what was up. Ive also seen them as stickers on the window.  The in accordance with California law thing actually makes it more creepy somehow.  Its obnoxious when drivers ask about the radioair conditioningtalking. I dont know if this is in your training or what ever but its totally unnecessary. Just dont play music you know damned well is annoying turn on the AC or the heat when appropriate and have some empathy toward peoples moods and you should be fine.  I assume all drivers have phone chargers.  If they dont when I need one they lose a star two if they are snippy about it.  A quick question about the route is a good idea but it should asked verbally.  Saying something like Main to Broadway then north to Proctor sound okay?  Yes I know its your personal vehicle. Q You know how you can tell a person studied Muay Thai in the first five minutes of meeting them? A Oh theyll tell you.  This is obnoxious and vaguely threatening.

8750314,0,t1_d6zemec,Despite the fact that your rebuttal seemed to be from the rd grade i can see where you are coming from. I honestly hope that you can put the child you to bed and have a adult conversation. What will most likely happen is drivers will have all apps up and customers will choose one and have a fall back one. You can see it with Lyft and Uber even now. I got a ride from this lady because her Lyft canceled on her and i was closer then other Lyft drivers. Remember when Uber and Lyft or any ride sharing company is competing it will be for the customer but since the customer needs a driver they will need the driver equally. I would imagine ride share companys will need to start doing more promotions and get clever to get the percentage of drivers focused on their app. Much like Uber does with the take  of all trips and be online the whole time. If you have  companys fighting over it it is unlikely they will set the price lower then their drivers are willing to drive for. Would a driver work for less then min wage? What about for free? There is a limit here and both Uber and Lyft are trying to figure out what it is.The problem is basically the same with a monopoly. What is to stop the ride sharing company to take  commissio? paying you as low as people would work for. I would have a hard time believing that you would keep that . a hour your hoping for. Monopolys especially in the US do not behave that way. I know Uber would take a bigger cut and they would need to honestly if . a hour was on the table EVERYONE would do it Unless your talking about promotions and stuff..ya i would expect those kinds of things gone. All this will happen over time. When things like this form its not a instant transformation but a slow sculpt over time. If Uber lost competition tomorrow it wouldnt change much...but in a year you would see policy changes that would reflect well on the Businesshigher commissions for example.  They will take things in baby steps trying to push the limits of drivers without causing a mass protest and crashing the business. ,uberdrivers,d6zg1fa,1,t5_2yzxz

Buses here in this market are considered second class way of transportation. And a subway will take  years to be built.Uber is trying to consolidate its  brand while creating a monopoly around the world. With the prices as they are uber is trying to get more customers who eventually will pay more for the fares. This of course will happen when self driving cars take over  allowing them to keep all the profits.At the same time theyre sending drivers an indirect message youre expendable.

Hopefully someone will put together the right combo of the features offered by the heavyhittersUberLyft in addition to the spinoff apps and if drivers can stick together enough to keep forming a collective voice things may eventually improve overall. I just got out of the trucking industry which has a litany of issues but truckers cant seem to stick together on any issue.

10791829,1,t3_5uc0sv,I have no way of proving my intelligence nor do I have a trade to do so. Ill have endless conversations with passengers ranging from alternate dimensions political science art investing and stocks to comic book heroes. I was talking to one guy for a while about developing nations and it flourished to existentialism and impending doom. Flourished as in its nice to know there are others who are accepting of their fate as I am. It doesnt help that Im a girl and their assumption is either I have kids to take care of or mom and dad pays for my main bills and I get uber money to party. Er no i pay for all myself and having a single mother that asks for funds herself. I used uber to provide for me while I had shitty parttimes. I do what I can to stay afloat. But I dont know why Ive received comments about getting a husband or if Im too dumb to anything beyond driving. But then as I speak with passengers they always give this surprised expression that I am more than just a nd class citizen. I had one guy grab me by my face and tell me Im too beautiful to drive and hed take care of me. Nah man. Im good. I now use the money to travel when I can. I ended up getting a full time entry level job thankfully and have health insurance!!!!! What I do is use my  weeks vacations floating holidays and  day weekends to go places with the money uber gets me now.Its not much sometimes I look out for deals on plane tickets with several apps and other resources. Ive actually been asked to share it on a blog or something. But eh I started one but I dont think itd really interest other drivers. Maybe female ones? If I could make a career out of traveling I would jump at the chance. But how does one do that without a proper degree?ALSO I do believe many of us are intelligent but as I mentioned above no proper way of proving it. And many individuals whom Ive met who are intelligent are either a. Brokeno schooling starting from the bottom jailed etc. b. Low Confidence of their capabilities orand C.

I was like im sorry but i wasnt soliciting.. i doubt ny tlc courts will care though... i honestly didnt know i was breaking a law  just ubers policy which i didnt give a fuk about. I give coworkers rides for money all the time in nj. If the agent had just raised his arm i would have ignored him but he literally came knocking on my window. Even if it makes a difference too bad the ticket doesnt mention that detail. It does say i asked for  but not who approached who and how,uberdrivers,dfwwk0j,1,t5_2yzxz

You got off lucky in LA your car is also impounded for  days which you have to pay for the total cost would run k. Pay the fine if not you are pretty screwed.

11587894,0,t1_dg9f9yc,I would be interested in understanding how you arrive at that conclusion.  My take is obviously completely different.  I do believe that good faith and fair dealing requires all parties to deal fairly with one another.  I agreed to the contract because Uber who is a market position to know has provided me with information that leads me to believe the agreement is fair and equitable.I think of it the same way I think of commodities.I agree to buy soy beans from you at a future date for a set price.  You agree to deliver those soy beans at that price and at that time.  If I go into this agreement knowing full well that the price of soy beans is going to sky rocket and I keep this from you I am not operating in good faith.  Likewise if you know you wont be able to deliver the soy beans at that time you are not operating in good faith.In the case of Uber they have agreed to provide me with passengers at a set rate because they are telling me that is what the passengers will pay.  If they know passengers are willing to pay more and they are going to charge the passenger more then they are not operating in good faith.In my example above Uber is telling me my pax are willing to pay . based on time and mileage but what theyve found is my pax are willing to pay . for that trip.  Thats where the good faith and honesty thing breaks down.Now if i look at it and say screw it Im going to always take the most expensive route because its faster and my pax isnt going to pay more for it Im not operating in good faith with Uber.,uberdrivers,dg9htzv,1,t5_2yzxz

11678292,0,t3_66lewy,There is a lot of talk about the poor pay and treatment on this sub because there is no Uber Partner community. Drivers are not employees and are not allowed to unionize. So there is no voice like in conventional jobs. Also drivers who are full time are people who usually arent in a position to be able to easily change jobs. Just go look at Craigslists jobs postings Uber spams exaggerated earnings targeting people that need a job. There is no trade school no licensing authority no degree catered to being an Uber driver. Its just barely above temp worker status. ,uberdrivers,dgjr1mo,6,t5_2yzxz
