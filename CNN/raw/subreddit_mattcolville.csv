8062249,0,t1_d4l52nn,gt But as soon as combat starts and sometimes even before that I am changing the bad guys stats to keep the flow of combat interesting. Hes too easy to hit up his AC. Hes got too many HP bring em down. This is stupid why does he have this spell? Swap it out for something else. Shit its only the first round of Combat and Lars just completely neutered Kalarel the Vile. The climactic combat of the last six months is about to be over after precisely one character has acted....quick give Kalarel a magic item that solves this!This just opened up my DM world. Ive fudged a roll here or there behind the screen tweaked a damage up or down but this... this heresy... Oh the thinks I can think with this! I had another post about evolving magic items which is also addressed here. Thanks for your thoughts Matt.,mattcolville,d4m9t8m,1,t5_3f0mp

8316041,0,t3_4tf2jb,Do you have any advice regarding how to make your players take note of the hints and other pieces of information you give to them?Im having some problems encouraging a group of newer players to use their surroundings.For example they have just rescued an ally from a bandit cave and another group of bandits are returning. There are a variety of traps they could make use of but instead they have decided to take on a much more powerful group head on despite multiple warnings from me via the NPC.,mattcolville,d5h285l,1,t5_3f0mp
8345469,0,t3_4tvvk7,So far I am enjoying the series. The s nostalgia was so very strong I suddenly realised Hey! Remember all those classic s movies? There can be more of those! and that made me very happy. Here was a bit of Goonies there a bit of Stand By Me all thrown in with the scary bits from Stephen King books and the movie Alien. It was warm and familiar and I was invested enough in the story to want to know what is going on.Two episodes in I mentioned this at work and they assured me it gets so much better. Now I am five episodes in Im not quite as enthusiastic as I was before but I am still really enjoying the show. My biggest concern is that this will end up to be one of those series like Lost or the Xfiles that never answers anything properly and instead feels the need to just keep piling up the questions. I dont want to watch a show that just slithers around from one weird thing to another no matter how well its shot and how enjoyable the nostalgia. Things seem to be tying together but I guess well have to see if they flub it or not.Edit to say Have to appreciate the acting tho  especially from the kids. The casting is great and theyre all doing a fantastic job. I wish we had seem more of Benny though ,mattcolville,d5kqjsh,1,t5_3f0mp

Sadly they are illegal so I cannot post the link I have ready to send to anybody who asks me. Hint. Hint.E is a great game. It doesnt work for some but it works really well for others. Ive introduced two new players to E this week  one of whom is running two characters  and they both got the rules immediately. A large part of this was because the offline version of the Character Builder allows some small customisation of the character sheet which helps removes the extraneous information and highlight the important bits.,mattcolville,d6gkrrb,2,t5_3f0mp

8798486,0,t1_d75c55o,I dont see any reason you cant run your homebrew campaign if thats what interests you. What is suggest  though is spending less time writing paragraphs of dialogue your may not use and instead focus on developing characters. Create NPCs and a world that has some life in it and expect the players to choose to interact with some things and fail to interact with others. Like Matt says create characters with plans and motivation rather than stories to drag your players through. If they ignore the fledgling necromancer long enough hes a powerful necromancer with an undead army and significant aspirations. Give them options and focus your development of the world based on what they do or dont do.   A reactive world is much more fun for players and DMs than a forced story. ,mattcolville,d75ghqh,2,t5_3f0mp

8829005,0,t1_d762eg9,I have to disagree having a full knowledge of game development might help a bit but my problem with them is the obstinance they dug their heels in promising features and suggesting a chance of multiplayer things like that but when people started testing it they found out that was a lie. I cannot stand lies on a developers side I used to work for a software company who sold POS systems and I could not continue telling the lies they wanted and I see it as the same thing. They sold tablets that barely deserved the name as top of the line super iPad then when customers asked for the specs compared to iPads they would say something to the effect of proprietary and dismiss them they didnt stack up to the first generation much less the  version. The other problem is people can turn their heads slightly and see star citizen releasing their new video showing people landing on planets getting out running around all of the things people wanted in no mans sky. Now I get it its a different game theres no real exploration SC is still in early alpha despite about  years and million and tens of thousands of people testing it for them but when you promise a feature then fail to deliver and see another game showing how spectacularly they are delivering on that same feature people are going to be upset more so than if theyd never promised and were honest up front and told people no or if theyd said it got stripped prior to launch.,mattcolville,d794g43,1,t5_3f0mp

9033459,0,t1_d7wkl73,Heh punish is an interesting word to use. On the one hand ED and her cult dont care about how hard things will be for the players once her plan succeeds and in a simulationist sense that should not be a concern for any of the bad guy plots in the world. Theres certainly a flavor of game in which the politics and plans of the world barrel on regardless of whether they inconvenience the players. That is hard mode in some sense but the players might enjoy that.On the other hand the DM should as you say be careful not to exert or appear to exert railroading control over the PCs by making things impossibly hard unless a particular plot is followed. Really the DM has the power to decide how far to turn the crank on plots advancing in the players absence.Also Matts mentioned that he often doesnt decide if a PC or a BBEG plan has succeeded until just before the session starts to leave himself open to plot twists and not to fall too much in love with any outcome. Perhaps thats also a decision the DM can make on the spot.,mattcolville,d7xog0l,2,t5_3f0mp
9101123,0,t3_54mh4x,I am often surprised at the amount of surprise about this topic.  Back in the day Character Death was assumed. I lost my very first DampD character to a Lurker about  minutes into my first session.  I fought  and fled from  a Carrion Crawler and then failed a single roll against that Lurker and boom dead.  Hand over Character Record Sheet.  Ive been hooked since.My next character met an early demise in the tunnels between Alfheim and the Shadow Elf Territory of Mystara.  nd level... maybe.  I did massacre a bunch of Goblins before hand. My next two RPG characters were in MERP.  I lost my first MERP character  minutes into the session.  I made a single roll  chasing a burglar well a burglar not myself across the rooftops of Bree.  I Botched and then rolled on the infamous RoleMaster Botch Tables  Your fall turns into a dive and you land on your head.  You die.  No Saving Throw no Hit Point attrition.   Just... dead.   It took x as long rolling up that MERP Characters as I spent actually playing him.I had a bunch of new ideas and I rolled up a new character.  Who also died.It would be several characters and nd Edition before I got a Character over rd level.  And that character  eventually becoming a th Level ThiefAssassin  died at the denouement of Rod of  Parts I laid in a backstab against Miska the Wolf Spider to distract him while our Paladin assembled the Rod.  It worked. I sure did distract Miska.  Who then killed me in one hit.Death in DampD is by my estimation part of the fun.  It separates RPGs from playing a video game where theres never really any high stakes.  And if you think your first Character is rad your subsequent Characters improve with time.Nonbelief in the DampD cosmology is somewhat... severe as the gods quite demonstrably exist unless youre on Athas or a godless homebrewed equivalent.  ,mattcolville,d85t50y,1,t5_3f0mp
9109908,0,t1_d86u1mq,That sounds like a deliciously terrible situation for them to be in.  Thank you for all your input and insight.  I think I will attempt to clearly present all the information they have available to them and then tell them that the choice is there on but they cannot choose everything.Heres where my group is atAfter wandering through the woods the party found a stranger tower.  They aided the wizard within who is super nice and helpful to them but she accidentally teleported her tower into a rather tight spot far to the south and the group hopes to travel there when they can but its been a lower priority item as she seems not to be in imminent peril.  After departing her they met a tribe of druids in a canyon to the north who were rather hostile to outsiders but the party began to win them over after they lowkey saved the village twice.  They head into the caves for some answers and return to find that a massive force of gnolls is going to summon their demon god and march on the village in exactly  days time.  The group goes to warn the druids only to find themselves arrested and kicked out because a mystery person has been turning the tribe against them.  Theyre annoyed so they head back to the starting town I mentioned in the first post.  Its mostly recovered but they ask the party for some more help with side issues.  The party also picks up on several leads to character objectives that are all pulling them south.  They now have a choice to try to travel back north overnight what might otherwise be a twoday trip to stop the summoning or maybe help the druid village that rejected them or else they can continue on their way conducting business as they desire and hope that their warning did not fall on deaf ears.Though the leaders of the tribe turned against them the party still has friends and family in the village and they want to see that these folks escape safely.  They also know that the canyon village is extremely defensible and can likely hold out for some time even against many attackers.  On the other hand theyve been burned by the villagers already and some players want to wash their hands of it entirely and head for more intriguing prospects to the south particularly to help their wizard friend who said that a dragon has taken interest in her tower.,mattcolville,d86v3rj,2,t5_3f0mp

9680410,0,t1_da68du1,Curse of Strahd is unique in that a lot of the NPCs presented in the module inevitably become party followers at least for a time. Ismark and Ireena should travel with the party to as far as Krezk you have Ezmeralda who will join up with the party after that or at Argynvostholt or the Wizard Tower depending on where your party goes after Vallaki plus the random carddrawn ally via either Madam Eva or Ezmeraldas tarokka deck. So they dont particularly need a generic training wheels DMPC from the start to help guide them or balance the party as theyre already going to pick up at least one if not two or more in the course of the adventure NPCs which will have far more background and characterization and ties to the story of the module than Random DMPC  and .Not saying what youre doing is wrong per se but I feel like at least that youre doubling down on a particular issue already covered by the text of the module.,mattcolville,da6bbyg,2,t5_3f0mp

9733149,0,t3_5egqi5,As far as I know that falls under Matts own StrongholdRules. So as long as he hasnt finished them he wants to try and finish them around the holidays if I recall right but dont pin him or me at that we wont see anything about it.It might be that e rules had rules for TGs as well as for Strongholds but thats a guess at best.What you need to consider if youll allow him to get his own TG doesnt matter if he wants to get control of an established one or build a new one is the already established criminal underground of the area. If its a pretty rural area there probabbly isnt much of criminal activity going on because everyone knows each other and a criminal will either be forced out of the comunity or become some kind of warlord of the area which will attrackt the attention of the local Paladin orders or the legal Lord of the area and maybe THEN forced out of the community... permanently.So it will probabbly be easier for your player to start his business in a city. A city however will much likely already have organized crime or at least the beginning stages of something like that.

9852057,0,t3_5gerfv,Constantly.Listen for your Players to make I hope that X and Im afraid of Y statements and then nudge your campaign setting to play upon on those hopes and fears.   You never know what your Players will choose to lovehate or latchontoignore in the outset.  I completely altered Alan Clayborn from Against the Cult of the Reptile God because the Ranger in my party wanted Clayborn to be an old friend of his.My Players currently hate a Cleric of Death named Abramo.  They were supposed to capture him and interrogate him for the location of a hidden lair.  In the course of their fight against him he drank two Healing Potions Cured Wounds a couple times and cast Invisibility in a last ditch effort to escape.  It completely irritated the Players in the way that a DM wants their Players to be irritated.  They HATED that guy.  So they killed him instead of attacking to subdue.There is a High Priest of Baphomet manipulating events from the shadows that the PCs will encounter a few sessions from now.  That High Priest is going to raise Abramo from death and turn him into a Death Knight named Lord Bram.  Lord Bram will be a major thorn in the Partys side.  Just imagine how infuriating and cathartic its going to be when they knock Lord Brams helmet off in battle and see the withered pale face of Abramo.  None of that is from the module its stuff I made up to play off what the Players care about.Geography.  I usually leave the macrogeography alone because I dont like to fiddle with world maps.  But microlevel?  I thinker and adjust all the time.  This is so easy to do.  Make a rudimentary treasure map in your graphic design program of choice print it out on some yellowish paper crumpleup and unroll it a few times tie string around it and plant it on a minor villain as an NPC handout.  And have the handout be related to something your Players have explicitly voiced that they care aboutloathe.  Which takes time.  Your Players can write a  page origin story before playing but they will not understand what their Character chooses to love amp hate until they actually start playing.  Which means you cannot tantalize what they love amp hate until they start playing. And dont forget one of the most powerful tools at your disposal  youre the god of the planet they are playing on. If you put an Orc kingdom  miles inland by the mountains but now you wish it bordered an ocean continental shift that shit!  Or have some sort of massive cataclysm occur where an earthquake sucks in a huge chunk of land and the waters of the nearby ocean fill the void see the Blue Mountains of Middle Earth before amp after the War of Wrath.Especially if the cause of the shift and subsequent flood could have been prevented by the Characters or avoided but for their carelessness.,mattcolville,darqupt,5,t5_3f0mp
9985576,0,t3_5iiyt4,Heres a basic outline of a session Im planning and how Id work random tables into it. Set Up The party is tasked with rescuing a prisoner held within a long abandoned castle recently renovated by an Orcish Fertility cult. Within is a holy relic a giant crude carving of a pregnant Orcish woman Think Venus of Willendorf the greatly increases not only the chance of conception but the age at which creatures reach maturity. The forest around the castle is affected as well however the beasts in the area gaining the same effects throwing the ecosystem into a tailspin. As the party enters the area of the forest surrounding the castle I know I want them to have an encounter but Im not exactly sure what it will be. I dont want it to seem like Im forcing them into something so Ill make a few encounters and roll for them. You want each of these encounters to set up the locale that the party is going to and have some sort of thematic connection to the world around them. Do know though that I might roll on these tables once or twice and even then I may choose to use the encounters I didnt use at a later time. It may seem like a lot of work but these are table that Ill probably be using for... Ever!I also want my party to get a magic item in preparation for their assault on the Orcs as its been a while so Ill include one with each encounter. Some of them are made up by me others Ive pilfered from here or there. Encounter Chart roll d. Hunting Party A giant boar crashes through the underbrush flanked by her unnaturally numerous farrow before charging straight into the party. Its littered in arrows and javelins. rd HP.  round later a warhorn sounds.  rounds later an Orcish hunting party rounds into the clearing. Loot Orcish Hunting Horn You can use an action to speak the horns command word and then blow the horn which emits a blast audible within  feet. Beasts that can hear the horn must make a DC  Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for  minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns ending the effect on itself on a success. When you use this effect you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. . Owlbear Cubs The party finds stumbles upon a group of Owlbear cubs. Nature check to know that theyre far far out of season. No cubs should be born for at least  months followed by perception checks. Failure results in the surprised condition for the first round as the party finds themselves between an Owlbear and her cubs. Loot In the off chance the party decides to follow the owlbears tracks back to its den Survival DC  there is a  in  chance the Owlbears mate is within. At the back of the cave one of the branches used to make its nest is actually an ancient staff once used by a cleric of ltYour settings nature deitygt who guarded this wood.  Staff of Saint Albricht The bearer gains a  bonus to Wisdom Animal Handling checks. The quarterstaff also functions as if under the effects of the Shillelagh spell at all times. . Dead figure The party sees a skeleton beside a tree vaguely humanoid but with misshapen features Its a mongrelcrossbreed from the Fertility Cults breeding program. If they investigate a single rat pokes its head out from the skull and squeals. Attacks the party.  round later rats swarm out from several burrows near the corpse.  Giant Swarm of Rats As per Rat Swarm size Large. Double HP and damage.  The Swarm uses its Consume Ability if able then uses its bite.  Consume The swarm attempts to envelope a creature within its space. The target must succeed a DC  Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and considered grappled Escape DC  as the rats swarm around them.  CR  Loot The HalfOrc wields a relic from the castle his clan now resides in once belonging to the lord of the manor. Ardens Ward Treat as a  shield when the wielders HP is half or less. . Spiders Ironically enough the closer the party gets to the castle the less life there is. The herbivores have eaten and killed most every plant within a quarter mile of the castle. Only carnivorous creatures roam amongst the rotting trees. Giant Spiders drop on the party from above. They can see in the branches above them hundreds if not thousands of the spiders eggs.  If a character decides to hit an egg sack there is a  in  chance dozens of spiders attack them. Treat as a spider CR . Not meant to consume resources only show the party bashing them will be ineffectual.  Fire will burn the webbing and egg sacks all though at DMs discretion the trees may set alight as well...Loot Above even the egg sacks the spiders have strung up their past victims saving them for later meals. One of them is a Tiefling a long chain wrapped about his arm.  The Chains of Ashur Dan House of the Taskmaster This chain functions as a  whip. It is bound to your wrist and winds around your arm when not in use. It cannot be disarmed but it takes an action to stow. Can cast Ensnaring Strike a number of times equal to your proficiency with chains bursting from the ground to imprison your enemy. The spell deals fire damage rather than piercing. Recharges d per day. Curse  Once you don this cursed weapon you cant doff it unless you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. It binds itself to your wrist unwilling to come off. While attuned to the weapon you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities. . Elven Rangers The party can hear the sounds of conflict up ahead. A group of Elven Rangers have come seeking retribution for incursions by the orcs and have attacked a patrol. By the time the PCs get there however the Elves are on the defensive.  After the battle the elves will debate helping the party with their attack on the Orcish base If the PCs say nothing th of the Elves will help. If the PCs interject and make a Persuasion check  will join on  ths on a  and all on . The players have disadvantage on this check if less than half the elves survived.  Loot From the orcs Necklace of Human Ears  Twelve ears strung on a leather cord. Eating an entire ear will cast cast the Wizard spell Fear.. Dryad A dryad limp and weak leans against her wilting tree. She calls out for help and should the PCs come forward thanks them. She explains the situation how the Orcish fertility cults magic is destroying the ecosystem and how the tree she is bound to is dying. She asks the PCs to save her forest as she doesnt have much time. She offers them a branch from her tree to aid them. If the players cant find a way to revitalize the forest within d days the Dryad will die her tree wilt and the magic in her branch fall inert. Note I have no idea how the players would do it but the resourcefulness of PCs is always astounding Loot The Branch of Caerulea This  lance deals an additional d piercing damage but the wielder can only speak Sylvan while it is held.  If the players are able to save the Dryad and her forest the branch becomes  and gains  Charges. You can expend  charge to cast Find Steed but only summon an Elk or  charges to cast Conjure Animals.  Additionally I might come up with some travel rolls Idle Encounters Roll d  A herd of deer meander through the forest ahead of you and though they look emaciated and sickly there are hundreds of them. One pricks its ears and spots you staring for a few long moments before bolting. A cascade of deer jolt to action as the herd escapes through the trees.   A  trebuchet broken down decades past marks the trail of some long forgotten battle. You see a rabbit poke its head out from behind the contraption and then another. And another. Soon you realize they surround you completely rabidly chewing on grass. As you continue the forest floor ahead is completely devoid of greenery.   A distant warhorn sounds and the trees around you come to life. Tens of thousands of birds take to the skies nearly blotting out the sun. Its only in their absence that you realize they filled the gaps in trees that are otherwise almost totally bereft of foliage instead sparse and sickly branches twist above.   As you round a bend in the game trail youre following the tree line on your right side opens up to reveal a long drop and a small river down below. On the opposite bank several hundred feet away you can see a pack of bonethin wolves tearing into an equally gaunt brown bear. At least a dozen of the wolves lay dead on the shore but you watch as those remaining land a killing blow on the bear before swarming over it.   As you pass by one of the few trails crisscrossing through this section of the forest a pair of trappers approach a mule pulling a cart at their side. Within you see a veritable mountain of pelts more skins than they might hope to get in a year but despite the grand haul they pass by with a solemn harrowed nod.   As youre passing through a small clearing in the midst of the sparse forest you step forward and the ground beneath your foot crumbles plunging knee deep into the soil. As you try to tug your leg up the ground beneath your other foot collapses as well. You see several dozen heads poke up from heretofore hidden holes in the ground as a hoard of gophers begins to chitter at you angrily. This trudging continues for at least a half mile the whole of this portion of the forest seemingly crisscrossed with tens of thousands of tunnels. ,mattcolville,db95d0r,1,t5_3f0mp

10113163,0,t3_5klvjq,As discussed below I felt like the movie was great  probably the best Star Wars movie largely because of what it adds to Star Wars since The Empire Strikes Back  but I felt it was let down by the battle at the end. Dont get me wrong its entertaining to watch but there wasnt a whole load of point to it.They land all these ground troops on the planet have a battle in the skies over the base and a whole fleet in orbit and none of it really does anything.The ground troops and the fighters on the planet didnt really achieve anything much and there wasnt much point to their actions  I mean the whole override switch out in the open and notlongenough cable contrivances to have the other members of the suicide squad do something while Jyn and Cassian got to the transmitter were fine but felt very much like things that existed purely to have the other team members go off and handle their bit before getting killed off. The reinforcements werent necessary for those scenes they just added to the noise.Out in space the big ships didnt appear to do anything except the hammerhead. Well the Destroyers did some pretty good crashing but all the fighting was done by XWings and YWings shooting at TIE fighters so why even have the big ships there I previously discussed in a reply to someone elses comments how a line or two of dialogue could have improved this  I called the Rebel ships Capital ships in another comment but that was wrong. XWings are the capital ships of the rebel fleet  theyre the ship that carries the weight of the battle and without which the fleet ceases to be an effective fighting force which is what capital ships are.The Vader scene in the ship as people are handing off the plans as he slaughters them really was a powerful scene theres the impossible strength of Vader the terror of his presence the desperation of the Rebels to get the plans away to safety and the palpable rage of Vaders goal being just out of reach and the Rebels getting away with the plans  it makes his killing of Captain Antilles after his ship has surrendered later something else. Now hes not just wantonly killing a surrendered Rebel because hes The Bad Guy hes killing him out of anger that hes been thwarted again.Ultimately regardless of its flaws I enjoyed Rogue One more than The Force Awakens. Perhaps because TFA does somewhat undo the victories our heroes fought for in the first three movies. Also the Empire really need another gimmick that isnt really big space laser that blows up planets I dont think that helped my enjoyment much. R however really felt like a Star Wars movie. I also loved Cassians introduction the ruthlessness of his killing the guy who couldnt escape with him said to me This is a veteran resistance fighter completing his mission at all costs. To me He was the member of the French Resistance days before DDay Because its easy to draw parallels with the Empire and Nazi Germany and Im lazy with my analogies.,mattcolville,dbpr5rt,3,t5_3f0mp

10451100,0,t3_5piwtz,My group has actually finished Book  and we are about to venture off into Book .  First recommendations...  find some way to hook the characters backgrounds into the story.  As an example  different characters were from  different destroyed villages...  Dragonborn PCs and an Elf Druid so I had the Bloodskull Orcs be the destroyers of the villages.  I also had the druids sisters be kidnapped since they were elvish spellcasters...That sort of thing...  so know while the Dragonborn are fine with being done since the Bloodskulls are done...  The druid is adamant about going below to find his sisters...  and of course his new friends wont let him do it alone!As far as combat and magic go...I found that just converting every encounter to medium or hard using the DMG rules kept things pretty smooth...  My PCs are th level heading down to the underdark which I feel is smoother as the underdark is much tougher... random encounter checks multiple times a day and convert the treasure based on your encounters...  the only real treasure I kept was from the original was the cottage that grows  as I felt the PCs could use a safe house they could keep stuff and use...Also what will help my group is that they have a ranger that has taken the Underdark as a favored terrain... so that will help lessen the immediate deadliness...,mattcolville,dcsqc0p,2,t5_3f0mp

10940950,0,t3_5wa30p,Something like casting lightning bolt is an action which has a verbal component to it as well as a focus through which it is cast a character must raise and point their wandstaffetc and start chanting. In the same vein attacking with a sword requires a character to draw and raise their weapon. If a character wants to cast a spell or attack  the action is not instantaneous. In a tense situation any move to prepare an attack would definitely be considered hostile and the enemy would act in the same moment to try and stop the casterattack the party. Therefore all characters are on equal footing and initiative should be rolled because initiative is essentially who can act the quickest to engage the enemy in combat. Maybe the rogues that you are talking to are extremely agile and when they see your magic user start to chant they quickly pull out their daggers and throw them at him. Maybe the wizard who was thinking quickly does manage to get his lightning bolt off first. Either way the first action should be left up to the dice it shold not be a free attack on the opponents. The exception to this is characters who have attempted stealth or are hidden from sight of the opponents as laid out in the rules for stealthhiding. You could also in a Trojan horse style attack dress up to get close to your enemies deceive them and get a surprise round that way. But in normal combat you dont just get to throw a free attack by being Han Solo and trying to shoot first rebel scum. Edit In fact in the Han Solo case Solo was first in the initiative order because he had a higher Dex than Greedo. Even though Greedo had his weapon out and pointed Han was able to move faster. ,mattcolville,de8hd04,12,t5_3f0mp

11433262,0,t3_6367lm,When Nights Grow Long Play with vision lighting and darkness. Perhaps at Night the darkness becomes true Darkness so even creatures with Darkvision cannot see through it. Make lots of monsters with Tremorsense or Blindsight to make them a threat in the dark. You can easily take existing monsters and change them to have Blindsight. Want a troll? This Trolls skin has been bleached pale and waxy from its years hiding from the sun. Its eyes are wide and pale two milky discs that no longer see his food. Instead you see the bristles of hairs across his face twitch and flick like the whiskers of a cat and he turns his empty gaze to the party. Bam now he has blindsight. This can even be a more gradual thing so in early levels its regular darkness but torches are often required to travel safely. As the nights grow longer they grow darker. Soon every town has huge bon fires around its perimeter to push back the Darkness but traveling out from the safety of the light will plunge them into danger. it isnt just that Nights are growing longer but days are growing shorter. Give them tasks for each day and a certain amount of time each one takes broken down into  minute or  hour increments. They need to do certain things but they have a limited amount of time before the next night. You know the Goblins are planning to attack the village tonight. You all wake up at dawn but as the days grow shorter you know you have only  hours of daylight left. What do you do with your time? Repairing your weapons or armor requires  minutes or  hour for both. Fortifying the main entrance requires only  minutes but it takes  hours to fortify the entire wall surrounding the village. Oh and dont forget that you havent slept so if you dont take a nap you may end up becoming Exhausted from fatigue. Nighttime is actually an alternate dimension. Like the Feywild or Shadowfell it is a reflection of the landscape but its twisted in some way. So a sparse patch of trees becomes a forest of twisted gnarled dead trunks filled with bats instead of leaves. As nights grow longer the world is being pulled further into this dimension until it eventually swallows them entirely,mattcolville,dfry5rp,1,t5_3f0mp

11454422,0,t3_63hsig,Honestly I would say this is OP.  There should only ever be  modifier at a time ever.  Also the defense options are way to strong.  The reflected damage should be removed and it should offer bonus AC and resistance to an element at the level of the focus. IE  Coal would give AC fire DR .  But you could not also have a  Obsidian with the bonus damage.  You should have to pick offense or defense.  If you want to offer multiple focus then I would say they have a maximum of  and it must be split between focus.  So they could have   focus.  A  and a  etc.Just my two cents.  As it is now its more powerful than a lot of legendary items.,mattcolville,dfucmg6,7,t5_3f0mp

I found my print copy on eBay for very cheap.The idea behind the article is a specific type of Paladin for most of the  Alignment combinations.  Garath  CG Illrigger  LE.  And so on.But they also threw in Follower Tables which are highly adaptable to likeClasses.  Myrikhans for example the NG Paladins are very like Druids even able to cast Druid spells.  Thus the Myrikhan Follower Table can easily be adapted as a Druid Follower Table once the Druid PC establishes a Hold a Grove in their particular Druid Circle.While Garaths are like as unto Clerics and thus their Follower Tables could easily be adapted into Cleric Followers one the PC Cleric builds a temple to their Deity.Illriggers have an utterly GONZO Follower Table.  Manticores Wights Dragons.  Easily adapted to Wizard or sorc Follower Table once the PC builds a Wizards TowerLibrary.Arrikans are essentially evil Druids and their Follower Table would work for evil Druids and Warlocks.And so forth.My own Follower Tables are a modified blend of the Plethora of Paladin tables and the e PHB Fighter Follower Tables.,mattcolville,dgloyt0,6,t5_3f0mp
