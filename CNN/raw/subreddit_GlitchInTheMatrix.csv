80989,0,t3_1rugwu,I know this one. as a radio ham more info over at ramateurradio the other day i experienced somthing very similar. it turns out it was simply my father speraking on the radio. I could not make out his individual words but i just knew it was him even though i had no reason too i did not know he was using the radio. anyway it is very common for radio signals to be picked up on cheap or even in some cases expensive headphones. The fact that you heard what you heard could just be because the voice was unclear but because it scared you your brain was more open to suggestion. perhaps the the explanation was even simpler and it was some kind of radio play. ,GlitchInTheMatrix,cenne92,4,t5_2tcw3

3377515,0,t1_cpc0sli,There are a few conspiracy theories none I seriously believe but I like to toy with the idea of them. My favorite one is that there are a few real universes and mostly programmed ones to test things on. This whole concept is mentioned in the vsauce video would headlights work at light speed if you want to check it out. However this one mathematician wrote a book that stated that we cant be in a programmed universe bc irrational numbers exist and they would be impossible to code. This makes perfect sense but part of me wonders whether irrational numbers are what this world was programmed to test and maybe our mother universe has pi thats equal to a whole number. Just a thought. ,GlitchInTheMatrix,cpd9fsh,2,t5_2tcw3

4612664,0,t1_ctby8c4,There is s scientific explanation for everything on Fringe too. At least as sciency as the XFiles was i.e. fictional psuedoscience.However stick it out. The first season isnt great due to the actress playing the lead not quite finding her feet yet. Somewhere in the second season it all comes together into one of the best character dramas on TV ever with the science stuff more as a plot device for them to interact brilliantly. And the actress becomes one of the finest workers in the industry too playing multiple versions of herself totally believably.,GlitchInTheMatrix,ctc09ou,2,t5_2tcw3

4804397,0,t3_3goybz,It depends if were aware of the simulation could we hypothetically hack it to make the operating parameters different?  Or would we be deleted if everyone became selfaware?  If you could make changes but only on a small scale without being deleted Id probably keep my trap shut.  But If I could do it on a grand scale then Id probably try to wake everyone up.,GlitchInTheMatrix,cu04ud9,5,t5_2tcw3

5224542,0,t1_cvfo7y9,Actually Im not usually keeping up with whats current. The music I listen is never ever on the radio in fact I drive in silence if I dont have my aux cord. There is a chance that some things Ive seen could be a subconscious memory. But its always this familiar feeling of having seen these specific actors in the movie or singing a song like it used to be my favorite. Theres something so familiar about it that makes it feel like Ive known it for so long. ,GlitchInTheMatrix,cvfqykk,1,t5_2tcw3

6247163,0,t3_410v5b,When I was in high school I knew a kid who could ask me to think of a number between  and  he would look into my eyes and guess it every time.

6539356,0,t3_453dcc,You definitely need to see a doctor for this episode. I dont think it was a glitch I think it was medical and potentially neurological.
