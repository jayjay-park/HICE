1305483,0,t3_2908dh,Open this sub reddit and expect some sort of magical enlightenment and to think I could write this .. without using the backspace key.. or the back arrow keys.. or any of this other nonsense that allows us to hide our true selves behind a.. some text that we have concocted.. yes I used the backspace key.. but I used the dot key twise to reflect my adhd. Natural typos get naturally and automatically fixed by habit. What a strange thing this is the internet my roommate woke up and I need to trim my nails to keep my typing more quiet. THe snoring continues. I actually deleted that capital.. overcapitalized article The deleted it right but then retyped it to reflect my growing honest as such a small.. incredibly small amount of time passes and my consciousness evolves by an incredibly small amount.
