Various county PUDs rolled out fiber networks in the late s and in  the legislature forbid them from offering services to end users.  They can ONLY wholesale their fiber.

The fiber runs right in front of my house and I cant connect.There are a few places that have put together small local internet providers that are tapping into the fiber owned by PUDs.

239857,0,t3_1wmks9,I learned at Snoqualmie and I love it but its way lower in terms of elevation so it gets less snow and sometimes itll be raining when its snowing at the higher elevations. It can get pretty crowded because its so close to Seattle. However my favorite runs are over on the Silver Fir side and now that theres a lodge at the base Ill pretty much be staying around there when I go.Stevens is actually my number one place to go. The runs are long and sometimes the lines are long too but they go pretty quickly. Ive never had any problems with them. I like that you can night boardski too! Crystal is beautiful but Ive never felt comfortable there as a snowboarder. Maybe as a skier youll be fine. The runs are great and the views are spectacular! Sometimes the parking lot gets kind of ridiculous with all the cars but take advantage of the bustrolley and youll be all right.Whistler is great. I go twice a year but they are a bit ridiculous with their prices. Even the day pass deals dont relieve much of the pain to your wallet. I mostly stay on Blackcomb instead of Whistler. It always seems a little less crowded.If youre ever in Vancouver and you want to ski but not go all the way to Whistler you can try out Grouse or Cypress. Ive only ever been to Grouse and while the runs are a little short the views are spectacular. And it helps that its  minutes outside the city.Mt. Hood Oregon is honestly one of the best places Ive ever snowboarded. Mt. Hood Meadows or Timberline are equally great in my opinion. The runs are long and you can night skiboard.

346445,0,t1_cfgjldn,Its green because that is the flame and oxidization color of copper. Grid power transformers are big fat coils of wide gauge copper soaking in flammable cooling oil. They dont generally use aluminium for transformers due to the resistance but if they did it would be whiteyellow when it ignited.Once that oil goes above a given temp and the transformer shorts out often due to leaking or aged oil the transformer cancontainer blows up due to overpressure the copper and oil ignites and the oil vaporizes making an effective fuelair explosive like a small nuclear bomb.See also thermobaric bomb or BLEVE boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion.Except a transformer is remarkably nastier due to molten burning metal fueling the BLEVE. Example the secret to the solid rocket boosters of the Shuttle or ICBMs is powdered aluminium.

373868,0,t1_cfjicr5,gtI guarantee that a huge loosening of building restrictions to allow taller denser varied housing in more parts of Seattle would slow maybe even stop or temporarily reverse the rising costs.I agree with this completely.But theres a demand for micro housing because theyre one of the only relatively affordable types of housing in Seattle. If there were more traditional affordable housing units those would be in just as high demand if not moreso. Developers just dont want to build those units because they can squeeze much more money out of micro housing units. Dont kid yourself that people are clamoring for micro housing and theres a huge demand for it.And in your first post you said we need more diverse housing now youre saying its fine to not have that diversity. I agreed with your premise that the solution is more housing Im just pointing out were not getting the diversity you admitted we needed.

383660,1,t1_cfkie2o,That is one argument that it is a failed policy is very arguable.However you are targeting NYC which is an actual rent control and very complex vs. rent stabilization as done in many places quite successfully.Additionally the cost of the few renters who never move primarily the elderly is allowed to be offset on federal taxes for the landlord.Third the cap is about rental increases only for existing tenants and can be set to higher than the increase in costs such as some places which tie it to inflation numbers.  seems to be reasonable.Last and most importantly I feel the social aspect is more important than a few bucks to a landlord. I feel housing is a positive human right that equals or exceeds the property rights of landlords within rational and empirically evidenced controls.When talking about renters most rent because of the inability to buy primarily because of income. Many tenants are vulnerable to arbitrary and extortionate increases above market value while the Landlord can often take advantage of the peoples inability to be mobile for many reasons. For example elderly or disabled tenants may be unable to move due to costs or health or access to care. Families may be unable to move because of a disruption to schooling of the children etc. The costs associated are nontrivial and these are just a few of the reasons that do not allow for free market forces to work in this situation. This is not a candy brand we are talking about here where one can just stop buying from one manufacturer and switch to another.Rent stabilization offers relief from the worst of these issues without significantly impacting the landlord from fluctuations in market prices.,Seattle,cfkj587,1,t5_2qhad

I havent driven it in months and plan to sell it this year.I use transit pretty exclusively but I like using ridesharing services as a backup.

They stay at the company for  years during which time the stock doubles in price. The cost to the company was  million even though the CEO made  million.If the company has  employees that works out to  cents an hour per employee.If  of those workers made  an hour increasing the minimum wage to  would would cost the company x the total compensation of the CEO. Raising the wage for a large number of people can be substantially more expensive than the cost of the CEO. And companies pick their CEO and compensation package  they have some control there. And if the CEO doesnt work out their contract can be terminated. Companies primary source of control over the cost of employees are the number they have and where they live. Im sure boards would love to find high performing CEOs who cost k a year. And yes of course businesses will be against cost increases they dont control. Why wouldnt they?

703235,0,t1_cgk61yh,It shouldnt just stop at being a law though. If people actually want riders to use helmets they should be giving them away. There was a video from eastern Europe I saw where police were stopping bikers without helmets and giving them helmets. Not a ticket. Not a fine. Not some kind of new income stream. They were taking helmets bought with tax payer money and giving them to people who werent wearing them. The cost it would take for a police officer to pull over and ticket people for not wearing a helmet is more expensive than giving them away for free. Its a waste of money. I cant imagine how much money free helmets would be on the streets.

Wilderness survival? They had probably never even seen the wilderness aside from across the fence of a cozy little scout preserve. Scouting is like any other organization. Just because you are a member doesnt make you some great person. You have to get to know the individual then make the assumption.

860964,0,t3_23ypp8,I think if we can first agree on what minimum wage is for it will be a lot easier to decide on a number. Many want it to be a living wage. I think this is a weird way to decide the minimum and it should instead be set by what is the value an unemployed person has for society?. Contrary to some peoples opinions I would argue that even someone without a job has a lot to offer society  and we should determine what would be a waste of their time by how much they get paid for it. As an example Picking dandelions for   hour would be a waste of time and they would provide more benefit to society by learning to play the guitar or making art even if their skill is low because it enriches our society.I also dont think that someone earning minimum wage should be expected to be able to maintain their own household by themselves.

981164,0,t3_25cfft,We played at the just added FootGolf course at Meadow Park Golf Course in Tacoma WAThe course is  holes set up on their short  golf course. It costs about  to play a round. No cleats are allowed so players have to wear turfs or tennis shoes. You can bring your own ball or rent a ball. You share the short nine with regular golfers though most golfers are on the bigger  hole course. You can have beer on the course if it is bought in the golf course bar and of course if you are . I would rate it not as easy as Disc Golf but easier than ball golf. Putting in FootGolf is as aggravating as it is in ball golf. The old adage Drive for show put for dough is very true in Foot Golf.The course record was  when we got there and  when we departed. The guy who got the record thought  was attainable.We had so much fun that we got some food and then played another  holes. It takes about  minutes or so a round.This sport is going to be huge. I cant wait for more golf courses in the Seattle area to add it. It is pretty inexpensive to install and gets younger people to spend money on the course.

Its a good program too a little less wellknown and easier to get into than the one on the Seattle campus.  Students there have been graduating and getting jobs making  a year on up past  with minimal experience outside an internshipand a lot of them got a big signing bonus too.  Nearly everybody who wanted to be was working within six months of graduation.  So yeah you stand a pretty good chance of getting a good job if you graduate from UW in Computer Science.The trick is to get in.  At least at Bothell you are admitted to the school first then the computer science major separatelyand you have to do some prerequisite courses before you can apply to the major.  I think the Seattle campus does something similar.  The competition is fierce and you will have to keep your grades up especially in those prerequisite courses programming math etc.  Its tough but if you have the aptitude and you enjoy that kind of work its well worth the effort.Good luck!,Seattle,chixyn7,5,t5_2qhad

1086947,1,t3_26jmkc,. No.. Because the rule you used to remove it clearly refers to selfpromotion or viral marketing and there is a precedent for allowing celebrity speaker announcements anyway. This speaker is also exceptionally noteworthy to anyone who cares about technology he has experiences which pertain directly to the future of companies based in Seattle and the issue hes speaking about has been hugely relevant to reddit and its discussions in exactly the same sense as N.D. Tyson and all the promotion he receives here.. AFAIK Glenn Beck doesnt actually have personal experience relevant to that topic so this is completely moot and wouldnt happen.. Glenn Beck wasnt instrumental in the leaks and couldnt offer a primary historical account of how they occurred or of any blowback received.. The same criteria thats used to identify a spam post in any other scenario primarily relevance. Its usually really obvious when something is spam and I refuse to talk about this like its rocket science.. Not applicable. See above.. If rule  is about any P.R.related activity and not personal projects then it shouldnt say personal projects.. Both. Moderators should exercise discretion just like anyone else with the authority to enforce a rule or law. Similarly precedent matters.None of this occurred in a vacuum. We all have a feel for what is or is not allowed and this request for such granular analysis seems like a lot of handwaving and deflection and it is also blatantly leading and disingenuous if you ask me.

1171499,0,t3_27ez5n,I think it is important to acknowledge the class warfare within the Asian population. According to the US census when Asians are broken down by groups some Asian groups are in a higher income bracket than compared to the median income of Caucasians and the US in general. Japanese Chinese Filipinos and Indians have a higher income than the national average while Koreans are about equal to and all other Asian groups Vietnamese Cambodian Laotian Hmong among others have a lower income. Of course there are going to be outliers but a letter like this implies that the minimum wage increase would be damaging to all Asians when in reality it is often times only damaging to wealthier Asians. This is not to say that there is anything wrong with working hard and having a successful business. This is the American dream come true for many hard working immigrants and their children but in the process of supporting policies laws and candidates that benefit the wealthier Asian class low income Asian groups continue to get overlooked and hurt by that support. Stereotypes such as that of the model minority does not help either as it causes lawmakers to pay less attention to low income Asians depriving them of much needed social services. It would be too simple to say that the reason Asians have not spoken out on this topic is because of the traditional stereotype of not making waves. I have no doubt that this is a factor but class is a factor as well and the Asian community cannot absolve themselves of supporting policies and laws that benefit their immediate families but not the Asian community as a whole especially the least of those. This letter does not represent them. Class must be considered when exploring why Asians tend to vote more conservatively as compared to other ethnic groups especially on fiscal issues. Class must be brought into any conversation on race including conversations within races. I would be curious of those who support this letter how many of them are struggling to make ends meet like so many Asians are. How many of them make less than a figure close to a quarter of a million per year or under . If we were to take a poll asking Asians who are financially struggling paycheck to paycheck and Asians who are not who would support the minimum wage increase and who wouldnt? I am one Asian in the wealthier bracket. I am self employed. I know some policies and laws that benefit the poor in my community will hurt me. I may not be able to buy the house car or shoes I want. I may not be able to travel to my first choice destination. But I also know that the increase in minimum wage will help my community. They will be able to make the next rent even if they dont live in the house they want. They will be able to pay for the bus even if they cant buy a car. They will be able to buy new shoes when the ones they are wearing are worn and tattered. They will be able to take a few days off even if they cant travel to an exotic place or visit their homeland. They will have a shot at the American dream already achieved by so many of us. For this shot they ask not for handouts but a living wage so that they can continue to produce and remain the backbone of our businesses.  is not enough but it is a start. I hope for the day when we can think of ourselves as a global community that cares for one another especially the least among us expressed not by rhetoric but by policies and votes. If you dare to hope the same then I plead with my own community to let it start with us.,Seattle,ci1ewz3,1,t5_2qhad

1187271,0,t1_ci2rv7g,Just to be clear they are  people on the county council. Theres a reason that Metro hasnt eliminated paper transfer slips and I would strongly oppose any push to eliminate them without providing a lightweight replacement.I think the system that most cities use is substantially better than ours. If you put cash in the farebox you get a digital receipt that indicates that youve paid for the ride and that includes your change if you overpaid. Because of the magnetic stripe these fare slips arent infinitely reusable in the way that Seattle transfers are. Even stamping the date on each transfer slip would be much better than the reusable ones we have now.Regardless I think that the cure of eliminating transfers slips is worse than the disease. Seattles bus network already has a bias towards a mess of spaghetti routes. Theres no way that we can build a cohesive network of highfrequency trunk routes if we penalize people for any trip that requires them to take two buses.,Seattle,ci36qg5,3,t5_2qhad

1195573,0,t1_ci41ybn,gt A club or lojack could deter the most ambitious of thieves and might be worth using.A lojack is not a theft deterrence device.  It is a recovery device.  It does nothing to help vehicle break ins but rather is used when the vehicle itself is stolen. When activated the lojack device will send a signal that law enforcement can pickup and track to find and recover the stolen vehicle.You will never see any outward signs e.g. a sticker on a vehicle with a lojack device installed on it.  For that matter if you have a vehicle with lojack on it they will not even tell you where the device is installed on the vehicle.The reason for all of that is the device only works if it isnt found and disabled by the thief before the signal is followed.  If the thief knows the vehicle has a lojack device they are going to look for it.  If the owner knows where the device is they may force the owner to tell them in the case of a carjacking.I presume you mean an alarm system of some sort.  Alarm systems typically make noise when a vehicle is broken into.  Some do more than that such as disabling the vehicles engine.  Alarm systems are often advertised with stickers on a vehicle since knowing that the car will make noise when the vehicle is messed with is a deterrent to thieves.  These sorts of devices often have glass breakage sensors that would detect someone breaking a window to grab an item they see in a vehicle.See Loajack entry on Wikipedia.,Seattle,ci44chk,6,t5_2qhad

Filburn  U.S.   was a United States Supreme Court decision that recognized the power of the federal government to regulate economic activity.gtA farmer Roscoe Filburn was growing wheat for onfarm consumption in Ohio. The U.S. government had established limits on wheat production based on acreage owned by a farmer in order to drive up wheat prices during the Great Depression and Filburn was growing more than the limits permitted. Filburn was ordered to destroy citation needed his crops and pay a fine even though he was producing the excess wheat for his own use and had no intention of selling it.gtThe Supreme Court interpreted the United States Constitution Commerce Clause under Article  Section  which permits the United States Congress To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations and among the several States and with the Indian Tribes. The Court decided that Filburns wheat growing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for chicken feed on the open market and because wheat was traded nationally Filburns production of more wheat than he was allotted was affecting interstate commerce. Thus Filburns production could be regulated by the federal government.gtgtImage iInteresting Commerce Clause | Gonzales v. Raich | Supreme Court of the United States | United States v.

Hes just immature and hell grow out of it there are wise pastors around him helping him learn and mature.We also experienced a wide myriad of attitudes and opinions beyond what Mark said on Sunday. We knew lots of people who were far more open and loving to women who worked gay men and women yoga Avatar drinking light beer !!! not being a weight lifter not wearing steeltoed boots men who were soft and emotional and sweet women who were feisty and super smart and outspoken.But then those bad things continued and expanded and permeated the culture. And those wise pastors left. All of them. Every single one.And then we learned more on how the actual church is structured and more specific details about how all of those things youve mentioned played out intrapersonally between Mark other elders and the members.Many of these things that are huge problems now are directly opposed to what Mark used to say at the beginning and even some of what Mark would say now.He says they are complimentarian. But in much of the church culture and in how Mark seems to operate he is chauvinist and misogynist. Women were told to stop meeting and talking about scripture together. Their worship bands were disassembled because they werent men. They were looked down upon if they didnt stay home and have babies.We eventually could not in good faith attend anymore or support.In fact we feel called to speak out and to support and care for those who have been abused and hurt by Mark and Mars Hill.We feel horrible for how our attendance participation and belief of some of these really distorted views have affected other people and supported the MH system.,Seattle,ciay2cc,3,t5_2qhad

The houses are very close and small but wildly diverse in design and build date making it the antithesis of Eastside McMansions. The landscaping is well maintained but most people proudly let the grass go brown in the summer. You dont hear people at night and the bars are almost always empty after . The food is great though and youll find a lot of restaurants in the junction area and sprinkled up and down California and th. People are friendly and it feels like a totally safe place to walk in the dark. Traffic isnt bad unless youre trying to get into the city in the morning. There are a bunch of new luxury apartments going in around the junction that may change the demographic but for now its a slow quiet community of mostly middle aged professionals.West Seattle in general is a bit funky with its narrow streets lack of traffic signs and numerous alleys. The proximity to the city draws a more liberal crowd than the southern burbs and its noticeable albeit not nearly as much as in capitol hill or even FremontBallard. Id say West Seattle is best suited for professionals who work further south RentonKentTukwilla but are drawn to the city. For these people the commute is really the selling point since you cant find a similar lifestyle south of the city and if you live on the north side youre destined to spend many a night sitting in traffic.

Time alone does a pretty good job of allowing whatever the original message was to be be blurred quite a bit. Eventually you end up with situations where people are able to act as the mouthpiece for something that the followers wont question and they can then insert their personal views in as organizational policy if theyre clever.He makes a very good point Organized religion is very good at centralizing power and that usually leads to bad things on long enough timelines. Ive got nothing against religion but I do have a few things against religions sects and churches that focus attention on single individuals. Its asking for trouble.Personal faith is great if youre not projecting it onto the actions of others. Its great if you and likeminded people want to get together and discuss things.

Whenever weve been in there theres  guys behind the desk and nobody in line and we are out the door in  minutes.The downsides are that while we signed up and were paying for  mbps they only enabled their lowest tier of  mbps. Their Comcast speedtest blatantly lied that we were receiving  mbps but when we called a tech out he confirmed that they never turned on  mbps and limited us to  which meant we were getting up to . mbps.  In any case they turned on  mbps for a few months to apologize. Our download speeds are up to  mbps now. Still not what were paying for and no where near the  we should be getting. Weve given up calling them about it because its clear they dont know how or wont fix it.Also our internet randomly drops periodically throughout the day. The only way to fix it is by restarting the modem and unplugging the coax cable. Weve tried  of their modems and bought a brandnew one Comcast recommended with  stars for use with their service. None of the modems improved the issue.Frankly though itd be nice to have a choice. While our experience with Comcast has not been great weve never successfully talked to anyone at CenturyLink.

Theyre basically a giant duffle bag with a heater inside and a probe thermometer you stick into the middle of your luggage.The second I walk in my door I strip down bag whatever Im not blasting with heat right away and put the whole damn suitcase into the thing and blast it for a few hours at a high enough heat to kill all lifecycles of bed bugs. Its still not great for your clothes or belongings but wont outright ruin them as will a dryer. Of course spring for the dry cleaning if you really need to. Added bonus is this works on items you wouldnt run through a dryer either!Just to be safe I also vacuum around the area where I took off my clothes and throw out the dust bag in a sealed ziploc right afterwards. This is also why I will never buy a bagless vacuum!Bed bugs are a serious problem in most of the world now not only because DDT basically the thing that eradicated them from the developed world in the first place is illegal but because the surviving populations have developed resistance to DDT and to most currently used pesticides. Theyre already hard enough to kill given their small size and propensity for hiding. Its not even fair that theyre evolving resistance to chemical warfare. ,Seattle,ck1ljnb,1,t5_2qhad

1888292,0,t1_ckgjjjm,It can be a little confusing in that it works as both a storedvalue card ePurse I think they call it where it has a cash balance.  If you register your Orca card online you can have it load cash or autoload when it runs low using a creditdebit card.   Protip it doesnt like to autoload more than oncemonth so set the load amount accordingly.It can also have a Pass which is where you buy a fixedprice pass thats good for a month e.g. of busriding.  For example your standard commuter zone Pass will pay the bus fare up to . each time you use it.  That pass costs  which is what you would pay to bus round trip for  days but the pass is good all month including weekends including in excess of  days of travel.  So  for any and all trips that would cost up to . for the trip.  If you travel through zones youll have to pay the fare minus .. ORCA also gets tapped to transfer.  Once you tap your card you are considered on the bus for  hours whether you paid with ePurse or Pass.  Keep tapping as you change buses.If you are tappedin as above and you board a RapidRide bus big red doublelength bus you dont have to tap on the bus and most of the time you can board by any door after hours they sometimes only open the front door for boarders.  Sometimes they will check that people have paid uniformed guys with some kind of reader hand over your Orca theyll check and hand it back no sweat. If you cant figure out how to pay for the SLU Streetcar just call it the SLUT with your Orca Card join the club.  Nobody seems to know unless theyve changed it in the last couple months. A transfer is supposed to be valid for the streetcar but that does you no good if the streetcar is the first leg of your journey. Light Rail separate fare so your cash balance will get used here.  Tap as you enter the station and tap again as you leave.  Else you get charged the full fare.Ferry Tap to open the turnstile cash balance only here. Register your card online so you can lock out a lost card and transfer any balance to a new card.  sorry for the wall of text but since they launched this card Ive had a number of occasions where Ive said was this system designed by idiots? based on my apparently erroneous beliefs about how this system ought to work. answer it wasnt designed it was cobbled together as a retrofit upgradeWhere to get ORCA Card?

1908172,0,t1_ckiohsq,Thanks for your interest in the topic androsix and your continued participation! I am glad this is important to you and as a nonshooter you are interested in learning how this law will affect recreational shooters and hunters such as myself. Ill address your response pointbypoint in an attempt to keep everything straight. I understand your idea of a criminal only being someone who is convicted of a crime. While various definitions can be found where a criminal is either someone who has committed a crime or someone who has been convicted of a crime the semantics of the word are not my primary concern. My concern is the concept of an accidental felon mentioned in the town hall debate. Simply handing a friend or certain relatives my gun while hunting or shooting recreationally will be illegal. That is a fact and that is what is important police and prosecutors will have the authority to arrest you if you commit this very innocent and common act. That is very concerning for me. Supporters of the initiative claim that even though they can arrest or prosecute you they wont so theres nothing to worry about. I disagree in a large way...making a law and then telling prosecutors and police officers to ignore it is counterintuitive and a very slippery slope. I went shooting two weeks ago in the national forest where it is legal to do so. I brought friends with me who were interested in learning more about gun safety and potentially purchasing a firearm themselves. If this law were in affect and a police officer saw me allowing my friends to handle my gun we all could have been arrested and prosecuted with a serious weapons charge. As you can imagine this would result in devastating legal fees and potentially impact my current career and future career opportunities. Even though supporters of the bill said to ignore it the law is the law and individual police officers and prosecutors can choose to enforce it should they want. For a lawabiding citizen this is quite honestly a terrifying concept.. Youre question regarding writing the law is a great one. As I mentioned earlier I think they need to better define what a transfer is and allow temporary transfers for recreational purposes. I would definitely encourage you to read the initiative before deciding your vote.. I think this comment is reflective of a fundamental difference in our past experiences. As a gun owner and recreational shooter I understand how restrictive these laws will be and how much of a hindrance they will be to activities I currently enjoy safely and legally. While they will not affect you directly I do ask that you thoughtfully reflect on the impact they will have on lawabiding gun owners across the state.,Seattle,ckj4f82,4,t5_2qhad

People are going to act recklessly without regard to others Im just saying that the people who are more vulnerable i.e. the people on bikes should be more careful and follow the law because them breaking the law puts their lives in danger far more than it does anyone else. Yes motorists speed and break the law as well but in my experience the  of bikers who run through stop signs or red lights or jump from sidewalks to the street or vice versa without looking or weave in between traffic to get to the front of the line for the light so they can go first and hold everybody up is much higher. Am I much more likely to be killed as a pedestrian by a car than a bike? Undoubtedly yes but you cant deny that bikers break the law and that they are putting their lives in danger by doing so. Its hard for a motorist to get killed going  mph if they do something stupid but the biker can easily die if they make a mistake so all Im saying is that they of all people should take precautions to make sure they as safe as possible and this would be for the betterment of motorists and pedestrians as well.,Seattle,ckrmvnw,-4,t5_2qhad

Its what I would consider one of the higher end neighborhoods with lawns and parks a plenty.  Nestled in are cute restaurants and boutiques about and its a quick drive to the city.  To put it in perspective Madronas main street is th Ave where as downtown falls within st through th I believe at which point Capital Hill starts and goes to another guess th.  I am over simplifying a lot as there are many smaller neighborhoods tucked in here and there.  Capital Hill is not a bad choice either.  The music scene there is thriving and is close to many of the others.  There are some wonderful parks like Cal Anderson there as well as one of the citys dog parks.  The food scene there is diverse and wonderful.  Being closer to the city and full of commercial life it will be a bit noisier than Madrona.I will relate my opinion of Pioneer Square in which I currently live.  I usually describe it as a mixture of crackheads artists great restaurants crackheads and some really great people.  The neighborhood is really starting to grow while still keeping its old time architectural looks.  Some of the finer restauranteurs are filling our blocks but then the next block over is full of missions and rehab clinics.  That being said the locals are a great bunch.

The point was you would go inside of this saucer shaped Ufo that would take you above the city of Seattle and it would show a similar hologram and you could use it to see Santa Clause as he flew over the city.

At least weight by population or something.My point is and originally was that Washington is too reliant on variable taxes like the sales tax.

I dont trust that anyone asking me for money on the street will be responsible with it whether they look homeless or like a banker.  I think its much more helpful if people research and donate to responsible charities.The biggest problem I have with some of these comments is the amount of assumption that goes into them.  Not everyone who asks for money on the street is homeless.  Not everyone who is homeless asks for money on the street.  Not everyone who dresses in old clothes is homeless or a beggar.  I read things like the comment about vermin and am thankful I havent run into these guys when Im on week  of having the flu badly being to do laundry hair disheveled slightly disoriented just trying to make my way to the pharmacy for some cough syrup.  Would they think Im vermin and yell at me to leave them alone even if I dont say a word?  Would they consider me dangerous?  Would they believe that when Im not sick I dress in a buttondown shirt and shiny shoes and work in a tall building making decent money?  I get that being asked for money is annoying.

The grounds are beautiful and everything should be accessible.  There is one optional hill which is smooth but I dont know if the grade would be OK or not.  Anyway the Locks have a fairly nice botanical garden that you can walk through or use a wheelchair to go through. The locks themselves are pretty nice  anytime the weather is good people flock to it.  You can cross the locks and then go down into the fish ladder observation room.  All of it should be accessible  there are two paths downward one which is stairs and the other which is a very gentle ramp.  To cross the locks you go across a walkway which goes over the tops of the lock doors themselves which is pretty cool.  She should be able to use a wheelchair across here  Ive seen people do it before.On the same side of the locks the south side there is also a long sidewalk  path that follows the canal for maybe half a mile.  Its a really nice area for strolling.  And Ballard has lots and lots of tasty food so its a good area in general for checking out.Also in some parts of the season different orchestral or choral groups play or sing in the botanical gardens part of it.

2156390,0,t1_cldvi92,I understand perfectly how the law works.  Ive read the law and I respectfully disagree with you on the level of enforcement.  The second amendment guarantees you the right to own a gun under the premise of a well regulated malitia.  Since a malitia is defined as an individual with a gun it seems perfectly legitimate way of regulating you as a member of the said malitia.The current law does not require you to do a background check to see if the individual is a felon.

2221958,0,t3_2kim7y,I think the simplest way to solve all this  Make people criminally negligent for any gun and actions caused by it if they dont fill out a transfer and background check on transfers.  If I trust you and hand you my gun at the range thats one thing.  If Im selling it to a friend of a friend how sure am I that somewhere down the line someone isnt going to commit a crimeND that injures someone.  Same thing would go for securing your guns  If you dont take the care to lock guns up and only allow children you absolutely trust access one argument for not locking guns up at home for self defense  Youre on the hook for criminal negligence should anything happen.  On the buyer side  Make it a felony to take possession of any reported stolen gun and enforce it.  Have a national database to run serial numbers readily available .  I think we should be aligning incentives rather than command and control measures.  We are never going to get gun violence to zero but we can make it easier for responsible gun owners and harder on irresponsible ones.  Criminals are going to get their hands on guns  When we do catch them with one  Make it a big deal.

2310442,0,t1_clx8db0,Well Seattle back in  was in a lot of ways like Portland is now. Not terribly expensive and kind of low key. Seattle now is a bit like San Fransisco was back in the late s a regular corporate boomtown. Its growing at a staggering rate and the people moving here arent generally young students or people looking for fresh starts. Theyre recruits with great jobs already lined up with Amazon Microsoft Boeing or somewhere else in the tech industry. As the city continues to grow space becomes a premium and rent goes up just naturally.

2514180,0,t3_2ofu98,This is going to going to turn into an argument that cyclists dont pay road taxes and should have to register their bikes. Heres why that would not be successful or viablegt Some bicyclist licensing advocates have claimed that police will not or cannot ticket bicyclists for moving violations unless bicyclists are licensed. In fact police have little difficulty stopping and ticketing bicyclists for moving violations when they are motivated to do so and have numerous ways to determine the identity of a person without a driver license. If for any reason police are unable to obtain satisfactory identifying information in the field they can always bring the bicyclist to the police station as happened recently to actor Alec Baldwin when he was stopped by NYPD for bicycling against traffic The real reason why police rarely stop bicyclists for traffic violations is because police dont consider it a priority in large part because our society does not consider these violations to be a significant threat to the general public.gt In some places mandatory bicycle registration programs have been employed as a means to identify the owners of bicycles. These programs imitated motor vehicle registration programs with the objective of reuniting owners with lost or stolen bicycles. In some cases they were also promoted as a way to help law enforcement officers hold bicyclists accountable for moving violations by facilitating revocation of bicycling privileges through seizure of the registration plate or even impoundment of the bicycle  Most of these mandatory bicycle registration schemes resulted in several unintended consequences. The first consequence was that the cost and inconvenience of registration deterred many occasional child lowincome and multiplebikeowning bicyclists from purchasing it in many cities the vast majority of bicycle owners did not comply with the law. Another consequence was that police ended up spending less of their time and attention enforcing actual traffic laws and instead shifted their energy to enforcing the mandatory bicycle registration laws. Low compliance rates also meant that police could often assume that a bicycle was unregistered and use that suspicion to conduct pretextual stops and searches of most any bicyclist they wished  Lastly the high cost of running bicycle registration programs compared to the price bicyclists were willing to pay meant that such programs were generally ineffective at revenue generation and often lost money. As a result most localities that experimented with bicycle registration either eliminated the programs or made them voluntary in the wake of citizen complaints.From the Police Enforcement section of Ask i am traffic Bicyclist Licensing,Seattle,cmmqpo6,6,t5_2qhad

2644323,0,t1_cn3qjq5,Legit. I was just wondering if you were gonna be one of those cyclists who think road diets are dumb but never actually ride in traffic on the street.I think the major reason to put a bike lane on Nickerson in the SPU area is to serve the businesses on Nickerson. Its unreasonable to expect someone to go several blocks out of their way to the trail and back when theyre only going a few blocks down the street.I also think the bike lane on NE th St is silly. But I think taking that road down from  lanes in each direction to  with a turn lane and on street parking is a good idea. If that facilitates adding a bike lane Im for it too. But they have to stop solely justifying road diets and alterations with the addition of bicycle infrastructure. Because thats just a part of the bigger picture and when they say mostly because bike infrastructure it just fuels the bike vs. car drama further...,Seattle,cn3qum8,1,t5_2qhad

2654642,0,t1_cn51gtt,A few reasons might be Because headlights are somewhat expensive and if they are on all the time they would burn out faster.  Headlights visually wash out turn signals directly next to the headlights. This effect is greater during daylight.  If everyone has headlights on all the time they make some important vehicles less noticeable such as emergency lights or more vulnerable road users like motorcycles. Its a similar reason why we dont drive around with hazard lights blinking. If everyone does it then they dont offer up much extra protectionvisibility.,Seattle,cn53b2i,5,t5_2qhad

That driver is expected to mark those  cans as contaminated to the city and if theyre not marked the company gets an earful from the city.Im not sure how theyre treating this in relation to other contaminations.

2741508,0,t1_cnfocvr,It isnt regressive because you would have progressive taxation brackets i.e. first  is taxed at  next  at  etc.  Additionally the idea is to get to very high levels of taxation at high levels of spending such that if youre buying a million dollar home you will be paying near  tax i.e. for every dollar spent a dollar is owed this is also a big way its better than income tax.  The deduction is designed to account for the money spent on basic goods such as food clothing etc.The additional big piece is that all income is treated equal there is no preferential tax rate given to capital gains over income from employment.  I too would be worried about loopholes but savings and investments are pretty easy to police because they can be or are reported by third party institutions i.e. your bank k account your brokerage etc. Hopefully Ive addressed some of your concerns.

2805650,0,t1_cnmzbgg,I probably cant demonstrate it to you but to me it has been demonstrated. Two situations admittedly far apart in my life whereby I rode parallel to a bicycle that was in the street while I rode on the sidewalk. Those bicyclists had close calls with a vehicle while I did not. By my casual observation they looked like they were being safe in the road. In other words it wasnt the bicyclists fault  it was the idiot drivers. So had a I been in the street I would have been subject to similar unsafe situations than if I had hadnt been. I understand thats anecdotal but none the less it is true it did happen.Im guessing your facts are studies andor statistics. Which by definition only speak to averages. In other words they do not account for the way I ride my bike on a sidewalk. And I can hear your thoughts now oh they think theyre special well no. What Im getting at is thisRiding on a sidewalk need not be any more dangerous than being a pedestrian on a sidewalk. If you can give undeniable and logically consistent reasons why all the time it is unsafe to ride a bicycle on the sidewalk Ill hear it but Im betting youre unable to or your argument is flawed.,Seattle,cnmzrji,4,t5_2qhad

The way I see it one of two things happened that day and both justify an investigation.Lets say she told the truth. As she turned on th and Pike the elderly black man swung his golf club at her identifying himself as a threat with a weapon. In the video this occurred at around  though its worth noting there is no evidence presented in that video to corroborate this claim to the best of my ability and as others have agreed he does not appear in the video until . She then spends the next  seconds going up and around the block waits patiently at a red light then finally comes back down the next street and rolls up on the man. I am no police but this does not seem like the appropriate response to an officer of the law being threatened by a citizen with a weapon. Why did she not stop in the intersection and immediately neutralize the threat? Perhaps she wanted backup first I could understand that. But then why did she not in the  seconds it took her to go around the block call HQ to report the situation? Why did she not call in reinforcements? After she rolls up on the man at  she starts the interaction with no explanation just a demand to drop the golf club. Its not until   seconds later that she finally explains her accusation to the man her claim that she saw him swing his club at her several minutes earlier. Why did she wait so long to explain this? Why did she wait so long to respond to a threat with a weapon in broad daylight in public? Even if she was telling the truth the whole time those questions demand answers.Lets say she was lying the whole time. I think its pretty clear why she should need to be investigated in that circumstance.,Seattle,co6zrx2,1,t5_2qhad

2999614,0,t3_2ui6v6,This is a huge pay loss for your wife. When I moved here I received a significant raise but with the increased cost of food and expensive housing it wasnt allowing me to save much more than I already was. This is a big downgrade for your wife and Amazon is only offering you that k signing bonus so they dont have to offer her a real salary and youll be stuck there after the first year.Worklife balance can suck depending on the team especially if its one of the AWS related teams which I would sincerely hope its not because if so your wife is getting low balled like crazy. Youd have to speak with people from that specific team however to confirm the conditions.With the money they are offering her youre going to need to live outside of Seattle if you want to live somewhere decent compared to your existing home so yes there will be a commute without a question as apartments even single bedroom in buildings that arent as ancient as the earth and awful usually run at least  a month in the more popular neighborhoods of Seattle.I think accepting this offer is a terrible plan financially. If you guys are really set on moving here have your wife start applying at other companies with similar work in the area.edit I forgot to mention that Amazon will expect your wife to stay at LEAST one year to pay back the moving company costs that they use. These costs are usually greater than k so youd be losing the entire bonus if your wife hates it and doesnt stay here. Its how they get at least one year from most people.,Seattle,co8wp5t,6,t5_2qhad

3159878,0,t1_copdung,The last death sentence in this state was executed on  Sept .  Washington has carried out five executions since reinstatement in  implying a cost of  million per execution.  The legal cost for a life vs. death sentence is about . million versus . million.  So how much money is it saving really?  I know its cheaper than a life sentence but its not exactly offsetting any debt either.  We could also make it cheaper by not legislating ourselves into a hole on lethal injection the most costprohibitive method something Im sure the lethal injection lobby is stoked about.  If we want the option to execute someone we shouldnt strip it off the law books because of the possibility of a legal cost once every  years.SOURCE  AN ANALYSIS OF THE ECONOMIC COSTS OF SEEKING THEDEATH PENALTY IN WASHINGTON STATEI suggest as another pointed out the death penalty should be on the table as a legal bargaining chip for pleas.

3191410,0,t1_cosql03,Most of the supportive housing programs Ive looked at are fairly selective with who can get housing so Id imagine that they could find ways to limit homeless people from other cities using the program.Also a lot of large cities have supportive housing programs although the programs might not be as large as Utahs and I havent heard of this being a problem in any of those cities. For example all links are PDFs New York City gave housing to about  homeless people This is program did not save money but the massive reductions in use of NYC hospitals and jails meant that the program nearly broke even Los Angeles gave about  homeless people homes The authors found massive reductions in public service use saving the city money. Canada also gave about  homeless people homes throughout Vancouver Toronto Winnipeg Moncton and Montral. The program was nearly break even for high risk homeless people but it was pretty costly for low risk homeless people.Anyway the point is these are all large cities that have tested Housing First programs. The cost of these programs were all over the place but Housing First can definitely be implemented in a way that saves money or at the least is break even. As far as I know none of these authors reported homeless people from other cities using the program being a large problem.,Seattle,cossfkn,36,t5_2qhad

3252176,0,t3_2xczyg,I had a pretty unique perspective because I grew up in Marysville and  left for the US Coast Guard in  and havent been back except to visit. Ive lived in CA the most of the time until moving back here a year and a half ago. Im a business owner now. First of all I was excited to finally spend time with family again and actually live in Seattle. However I was pretty dismayed leaving the beautiful San Diego weather and leaving a great network of friends and business networks. When I got here I followed some advice of friends and moved to Cap Hill which while exciting wasnt right for me. I was pretty shocked at how hard it was to make friends or even make conversation. Im a pretty friendly guy and found it hard to break into any of the circles there and felt that it had more cliques than I expected. I recently moved to Ballard and found that the people here were closer to my old ass age of  which helped but it is still a challenge for sure. People here have no followup.. youd meet them and exchange information and thats it. Going back to San Diego I found that the people there were shockingly more friendly and laid back especially in contrast to Seattle. I found myself missing that. Interesting side note my girlfriend moved here with me for the first time. Shes had WAY more success finding friends and has a great group of friends from work. On the positive side I found the city and surrounding area way more interesting than San Diego and love it. So its a mixed bag. Oh and on the business side this place is a tough nut to crack. I still get way more business in CA and it seems easier to at least get in the door. ,Seattle,coz3ja0,6,t5_2qhad

The current fine for A.. is  and thats clearly not doing the job.  I was surprised to learn its less than the fine for skateboarding at Westlake  littering  or permitting an animal to bark .King Countys  fine seems much more appropriate  with consistent enforcement that would be a more effective deterrent for your average teenager or drunk.

3334608,0,t1_cp7mfsc,Well as a relative newcomer Id  say a lot  of that  is due to the  insane way the crosswalk signals work. A lot of  places if youre at a busy intersection you always get the walk signal if theres a solid green in the  direction youre  walking. If you get to a busy intersection here just as its turned green you have  to wait for an  entire other  cycle to get a walk. If  you just walk with a green and not a walk signal  the light  will often change  before you can even get across.EDIT  I should have included that one of  the main issues is  that  you have to press the button before the  light turns at many intersections. Many places with a lot of traffic around the country dont require it and the  button is there to signal to the system that people are  waiting not a requisite to let people cross.,Seattle,cp8ddfn,3,t5_2qhad

At this point they might not even know as raising prices also affects customer behavior.

Moving across the country will not resolve the problem of a nonapplicable skill set.  ,Seattle,cqc70rs,1,t5_2qhad

3765105,0,t3_33iaai,Former HR here. When I worked at Large Area Nonprofit LAN the hiring managers could hire someone in at up to the midpoint of the salary range. So yes there would be some wiggle room in the salary. If its a union position look up the contract and pay scale online. If youre unclear just ask them Is there any wiggle room in that number?What I found intriguing was the hiring managers could request to hire someone in above the midpoint but they had to justify it via written request and those written requests came in at a ratio of  for men and  for women. So at a LAN that employed a ratio of  womenmen  of the requests to hire in above the midpoint were for men. An astonishing fact that I would not have believed if I hadnt been the one receiving the requests.The takeaway is that if youre a man you have a much better shot at being hired in above the midpoint. Do your best regardless because all future pay raises whether union or nonunion will be based upon the step in the range at which you start.,Seattle,cqlg871,1,t5_2qhad

I discovered this early in life back when I was a tween and my friends and I had a penchant for pelting cars with water balloons from behind the massive berm of yard waste that flanked the busy highway near our houses. Place a huge branch or a rock in the middle of the road and youve created a traffic hazard where the cops show up and hunt you down. Place the same large object next to the road and motorists will slow down just as if as the junk was in the middle of the road.  There was nothing more satisfying aside from discovering troves of discarded porn found money and snow days than the whump whump whump of water balloons bursting against the cars whose drivers had stupidly slowed down because there was a branch next to the road.  Occasionally a motorist who had apparently forgotten the joys of childhood would screech to a halt and boil out of his vehicle like a single furious wasp.  Of course the poor slob would end up drenched by the second fusillade we held in reserve for exactly this type of person.  My friends and I would flee melting into the safety of the nearby woods then roll on the ground crippled by laughter that was as powerful as the motorists fury.Anyhow I recently experienced a massive slowdown on northbound I on that entrance and exitless straightaway that passes Boeing Field.  The source?  A pair of rainsodden pants whose legs projected a couple of feet into the road.  Folks had stopped and were attempting to change lanes in order to drive around them.,Seattle,cquu0m7,15,t5_2qhad

4049164,0,t1_crhmjca,Why should it be though? I mean seriously surely we can do better than just eliminating everything worthwhile or cool.When Bandoleone Porta and Hines Public Market Coffee were nuked by a mixeduse condo building with spaces below they were told that there was under no circumstances going to be a bar underneath it. A coffee shop fine. And lo and behold today theres a coffee shop and a lampshade shop sitting underneath the condos where two of the best barsrestaurants in that area lived. And Hines Public Market coffee was to die for. It gutted the best of the Eastlake nightlife scene instantly.That was . And it sucked. I live in Seattle so that I DONT have to live in a cookiecutter McMansion in the suburbs with an HOA and everything looking the same bland drab subdivision crap. I love Seattle because theres a little bit of random everything here  and it did it without looking rundown and desparate like areas of Manchester UK or Montreal and not cookiecutter chic like any stripmall in Orange County with painted plaster or fibercrete walls and a backlit plastic sign on the front of otherwise the same cut amp paste frontage.Sure some of this may be hating change for the sake of hating change but you know what? Not all change is good.Bandoleone moved to Fremont in the Adobe building where its new white walls and huge windows meant that it had about  of the character. And then got shut down when they repaired the Fremont bridge for a year put hurricane fencing all the way around in front of the bar and refused to put up signs saying that the bar was still open.

No end in sight presumably its their way of honoring the War on Terror. So there are many miles of that stretch of road that go to two lanes just cause they want to tear up the road.OC has a lot to hate but I love driving on their freeways. They have lots of lanes and if you hit at the right time you can do  for the whole county until... You pass into LA County.There you drop to maybe two lanes and no carpool lanes and youre at  mph. Ive been in plenty of situations where I blast through the OC and then find myself stuck maybe  meters into LA County.The ironic thing is driving on surface streets in OC suck since they dont sync their traffic lights and youll hit five stoplights in a mile.

4310115,0,t3_3acbmc,There really arent a whole lot of solutions for heavy traffic but here are some things that would alleviate problems in light to moderate traffic. Merge at the speed of traffic. Its a pretty simple concept.. Utilize the entire length of the merging lane its there for a reason. Example Southbound I entrance off Denny. Cars just bunch up at the beginning. Im convinced drivers get freaked out over not being able to merge quick enough to avoid the next two downtown Exit Only lanes so they try and get over as soon as they can. If they just kept going they could catch up to the speed of traffic and merge much more seamlessly. Also that lane lasts longer than you think.. Exiting once you know which exit youre taking and are in the proper lane PLEASE do not slow down to  mph a half mile to a mile before the exit. That makes it harder for cars entering to pick up enough speed to match traffic.

4341891,0,t1_csetjz4,gtThe C is gone once the good is manufactured there is no going back.A huge portion of most garbage is solid carbon.  Pizza boxes yard waste food scraps odd bits of unrecyclable plastic.  If you incinerate those items that carbon will be converted into CO and escape into the atmosphere. Alternatively you could bury that carbon back in the ground where most of the fossil fuels came from anyway.gtSo the rest becomes litter clearly dumping trash into rivers streams and oceans is terrible for the environment. gtLandfills generate tons of greenhouse gasses like methane that are way worse than C for the atmosphere.While landfills do produce some amount of greenhouse gases its nothing compared to incinerating the trash.  This is easy to see due to the sheer amount of solid carbon waste that is sequestered in the landfill.  Additionally Methane has a short life span in the atmosphereit has a half life of  years which is pretty much nothing since the time span for global warming is in the  year range.  Additionally landfills only produce  of the methane.  You could eliminate all methane from landfills and you would still have  of the remaining sources of methane to deal with.    gtNone of the above even accounts for the carbon loss of the infrastructure of recycling trucks plants and trips wasted collecting a tiny fraction of recyclable goods.I wont disagree with that.  There are definitely certain parts of recycling that are done mostly to make our selves feel better about our selves rather than actually minimize the amount of damage being done to the earth.gt burning trash in a pile in your yard is very different than modern incinerationEven trash burning plants from the s and s are notorious for spewing out heavy metals  dioxins furans  sulfur and nitrous compounds etc.  While more modern plants can filter out those compoundsor in the case of the dioxins and furans incerate them  The plant is now starting to build up a giant pile of highly toxic flu ash which consists of all the compounds that would have otherwise been released into the air.  This flue ash is largely dumped in land fills.  At that point the only thing that has been accomplished is that youve convert all of the solid carbon into CO  Spent a whole lot of money on an expensive power plant that could have gone to better use.

4412034,0,t3_3bd8t3,What people consider Downtown tends to depend on if they actually live in the city or in one of the suburbs or are just reading some random online map. From suburbia anything inside Capitol HillBelltownFirst HillSoDo etc is Downtown Seattle. Within the city people get very. . . . territorial about what neighborhood they live in or dont live in. As someone else mentioned Seattle is very neighborhoodcentric but you can get from many neighborhoods into downtown fairly easily without a car. I lived on the edge between Capitol Hill and First Hill for a while and downtownwaterfront was an easy walk as long as I didnt mind going uphill to get home. There are also buses that run pretty regular routes up and down from there.You mentioned Harbor Steps which is one of my favorite places to live downtown. Be aware that some of the apartments there can be very noisy if theyre on the st Ave or Seneca street side. But the community and the staff are all great and the ability to transfer to their other Equity Residential properties can be useful. The key with Equity is to remember that theyre just a giant conglomerate and they dont really care about you your rent or your renewal personally but the local staff will if you find the right place.You could also look at Queen Anne and South Lake Union for places they will have pretty good access to downtown as well.Good luck and enjoy your time here!,Seattle,csmyyne,1,t5_2qhad

Unless we figure out how to issue passports thats just the way things are. Since its raining men and women at an apparently lower rate we need some infrastructure if we dont want all that people just collecting in the streets.My own feeling is that some ADUs near transit is a perfectly cromulent way of accommodating a little bit of that density. But most of the density should probably happen close to where weve made the biggest investments in transit and could scale capacity up further.

Hell I once got drunk and tried to fight a floor. Fun times! Those were mistakes. But even at my worst I never got behind the wheel after drinking heavily because Im not an asshole.Drunk driving is not a mistake. It is an intentional decision to endanger and possibly kill people because Fuck them calling a cab or a friend is too much work. Its the sort of thing you dont do if youve ever met someone who lost a child to a drunk driver so long as you are a halfway decent person.If you have a normal tolerance then limit yourself to one drink an hour no more than three drinks total and if you do decide to have that third give yourself an hour or so before driving. If alcohol affects you strongly then just have one drink or none at all. Or just dont drive and get as wasted as you like.Im sick of this It could happen to anyone bullshit.

4723812,0,t1_ctn88pm,Alright. Its good that youre flexible because that is going to be the best way to make the situation work for you.Id suggest making a list of  cities in the Northwest that youd be fine living in. Then do proscons with actual numbers. Go check the employment stats for those cities and cost of living. See if you can figure out how pervasive the massive transit is or average commute times for people in those metros. Maybe check what their jobboards have. That will give you a good starting point for comparing your odds. While you shouldnt necessarily go with the best pick on the list it will also give you some relative knowledge. Like knowing that cost of living in Portland is lower than Seattle but that there is more unemployment in Portland. Or knowing that it is cheaper to live in Tacoma and it has a similar employment rate to Portland. Best of luck to you. I hope it all works out for the best. The northwest can be a spectacular place. The biggest tip of advice is not to expect anything from the peopleplace. A lot of people move here thinking that it will all just work for them and that this place is looking to cater to them. Thats not the case. If you want a job you have to find yourself a job. If you want friends you have to go out and make friends meetup.com is useful. The biggest takeaway is you need to be responsible for what you want out of this area. It probably wont be handed to you. It seems your proactive enough to be looking for advice so Im sure youll get a handle on it.,Seattle,ctpz5la,0,t5_2qhad

Just because its being used here in Economics doesnt make it not statistics. gt And the whole point of modeling is to better understand an overly complex world.Right and failing to realize your model excludes a vast vast wealth of real world factors means youve failed to understand the models limitations. Saying well it works like this in my model sure it works like this in real life is fallacious. gt Exactly what about the laws of supply and demand do you consider arbitrary? The fact that theyre based on social science should discredit any real law aspect along with the fact that the basic algebraic math portions of the whole DS curve relies entirely on ignoring almost every other useful variable.

4842119,0,t3_3h5b89,I was in a similar situation a little over a yr ago. I would recommend visiting multiple jewelry stores in person. Familiarize yourself with the three Cs and their effects on price paid. Have a look at the varying grades of diamonds and understand what is actually visibly detectable by eye. At a certain point you pay for quality a naked eye will never notice.  After you get a handle on the basics have a look online. Jewelry Stores tack on   margin to support their added fixed cost of brick and mortar and sales force. I ended up purchasing on jamesallen.com. I found this to be the best shopping expirence because they have high resolution images of the diamond you are purchasing   Blue Nile does not.

4845725,0,t1_cu5b9iv,The problem with this argument is that it is really King County that subsidizes all the infrastructure and services for all the eastern and southern counties. Like so gtKing County with roughly  percent of the state population produced  percent of state tax revenues yet it received back less than  percent of state benefits. Thats a return of only  cents on the dollar...Then we have to go to the state legislature where the aforementioned Walla Walla elected officials hold what is essentially our tax money hostage and wont fund Seattle infrastructure and services that we have already paid for in sales taxes unless we agree to give them a wildly disproportionate share of the aforementioned revenue often for infrastructure and services that they dont really need based on their meager population. So weve already dug into our pockets its just that other parts of the state wont let it be spent where it should be.

4943654,0,t1_cuhlxhp,I dont think Id say scofflaw more that a lot of drivers are not concentrating or taking and pride in driving and theres very little penalty for doing tihngs like blocking a junction compared to the potential reward so the incentive it to do it wrong since theyll probably get away with it.Dexter and Mercer does have this  its on my commute home  but it has other timing issues of its own. Unless every driver in the rightturn lane is awake and goes reasonably quickly then the right turn lane cant empty before the light changes again. Now you have a set of people wanting to turn right holding up the traffic that wants to go straight on.While I know the plan is to increase bicycle traffic my observation is that cyclists build up waiting for their turn to go safely then all go as a batch and are at least a block away before their light changes with the straightahead traffic from Dexter and the rightturns are allowed to go. On the plus side the right turn from Dexter to Mercer is nearly always into a gap but theres few enough cyclists at the moment that I feel their light could have half the time without affecting many of them. That said it would affect them for longer if that happened.Personally my solution would be to give them a head start against all the trafficstraight and turners afte rthe pedestrians get their turn and then allow both turning and straight ahead traffic from Dexter.Im not a town planner nor do I have any training so my idea may be terrible or may also affect straight ahead on Mercer to make it the worst road to take on the planet.,Seattle,cuhoqsu,-1,t5_2qhad

4949242,0,t1_cuiccnl,The law seems to agree that this is discrimination. Her story is basically the inverse of the regulation below part of the US Family Medical Leave Act gtc The Acts prohibition against interference prohibits an employer from discriminating or retaliating against an employee or prospective employee for having exercised or attempted to exercise FMLA rights. For example if an employee on leave without pay would otherwise be entitled to full benefits other than health benefits the same benefits would be required to be provided to an employee on unpaid FMLA leave. By the same token employers cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions such as hiring promotions or disciplinary actions nor can FMLA leave be counted under no fault attendance policies. See ..SourceAlso the other than health benefits is mentioned above because this FMLA section specifically saysgtDuring any FMLA leave an employer must maintain the employees coverage under any group health plan as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of  at  U.S.C. b on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if the employee had been continuously employed during the entire leave period. So its like Amazon read the provisions above and did literally the exact opposite. Immediately after she exercised FMLA leave they took her health insurance benefits by accident and then put her on disciplinary action.Disclaimer Im not a lawyer.,Seattle,cuie4ed,15,t5_2qhad

Seattles unemployment peaked at nearly  the highest of any major city in the US in that recession.

Even more unfortunately they seem to be a disproportionate target for victim blaming.  Fortunately people concerned about rape have done a very good job to bring light to what victim blaming is.  As a historical sidenote victim blaming was actually coined in a reference to racism for example the slaves deserved their treatment.  I do understand the risk of meaninglessly tying charged labels like terrorist abuser victim blamer literally Hitler to things just because you dont like them.

It is a difficult issue.  However to avoid robbery we should look at the root of the problem why are robberies happening and find a better solution than robberies wont happen if people lock their doors.

Take the multitude of companies that outsource their production to countries with much more lax labor laws. When you have an employee on LOA for an extended period of time they are not making money. When youre paying them they are actively losing you money.  So if they have the option of not losing money by setting up shop in a city immediately next to the one that is going to cause them to lose money why wouldnt they take it?

Im also get that what they were doing was more trolling than actual protest.BLM has had a massive amount of media coverage. What they do with that will be interesting.

CenturyLink did not have a city franchise until it wanted to sell television service and its been offering Internet service here for decades.  Companies like CondoInternet Atlas Networks ReallyFastNet and Salmon Bay Internet also lack a city franchise and sell Internet service.Seattle could tomorrow morning start stapling fiber to utility poles to build a citywide municipal fiber network and theres nothing Comcast could do to stop it short of getting an initiative passed to change the law.,Seattle,cxzg5zh,5,t5_2qhad

Every now and then its probably due to someone not paying attention and didnt notice the autograt but a good portion is due to people tipping above and beyond probably because of the reasons you stated.I can kind of see why they dont build it into the costs of the menu items directly. Theres expectations of prices for every little thing you can think of how much a salad should cost a soda a Grey Goose martini whatever. Even mentally capable of people that understand the offset in price and rationally let that affect their purchasing decisions its still much easier to compare baselines and then factor in gratuity than it is to detract the gratuity from the base price and compare the prices backwards.In essence what the restaurant is doing here is treating every table like a banquet party or table of  where autogratuity is usually instated to make sure the servers dont get screwed. Im not entirely sure what this sign means by in the form of wages because if the restaurant doesnt directly split that gratuity to the staff and instead give everyone a flat rate then youre screwing your top servers royally and suddenly Sundays and Mondays become the most desirable shifts. If they do add the gratuity to wages then this method isnt that bad because then its a matter of simply dividing the gratuity up based on foodliquor and tipping the back of house and bartenders accordingly.Also one thing to note and this is unfortunately just a fact of the trade theres something a bit venomous about how servers view certain demographics and minorities based on stereotypes or even downright racism. Im not blaming servers here but theres a certain sense of apprehension regarding some tables that negatively affects service and I think having some sort of mandatory standardized tipping scheme might alleviate some of those tensions. This goes both ways especially in corporate restaurants where management is afraid of banning people its not too uncommon to get repeat customers that will always always stiff their servers and even outright demean them because they can. At least when you know youre getting a tip from a table its easier to withstand the abuse a bit.,Seattle,cyndvlj,2,t5_2qhad

The obvious thing is to avoid heading out on trails if you have miserable shoesboots with crummy tread. Youll want some footwear that has some grip to it so you wont slip and tumble. My only other advice is to be mindful that sweating doesnt quite work so well in this weather. If you anticipate a strenuous workout do not underestimate how miserable it can be to have your underlayers damp with sweat which now cannot evaporate due to everything else around you being sopping wet with offthecharts humidity.I would put a few spare cotton shirts in a plastic sealed bag so that way if you decide youve just about had it or feel you are having a miserable time then all hope is not lost ,Seattle,cywxyjs,2,t5_2qhad

It was a jewish neighborhood then japanese then after they were interred and lost their houses allegedly wealthy African Americans from the rainier valley gentrified the neighborhood.gtThe CD has decent public transit while the suburbs people are being forced into have none increasing cost of living further and decreasing quality of life. Tell that to the large black communities in federal way who bailed on the CD years ago they are all really upset about it.Just kidding people like having a community and being away from the gangs and crime.gtFor  years black people have been arrested and put into the criminal justice system on the exact corner Ikes is set up on. While this speaker was growing up there were two SPD vans that profiled the black students of Garfield and Nova High Schools taking photographs from afar and trying to find dirt on them in the form of weed usage. Now Ike is a very white and corporate attempt to corner the market. He illegally bought the license from someone that won the states permit lottery pushed the ban of weed stores in downtown supported ending medical marijuana and built an arcade next to a planned competitor in Capitol Hill making it too close to children despite the church right next to Ikes in the CD with sunday school since only white NIMBYs push that kind of zoning regulation. Ikes heard this smirking the whole time then said I have nothing to say and left. His branding is very aesthetically pleasing and fits right in with gentrification comfortable for the new wealthy folks to use.holy conspiracy theories! Of course it makes the most sense that Ian is a cartoonishly evil super villain who has it out for a neighborhood thats former tourist attractions included two shooting galleries  now just one! and a  hour gold buyer.gt The speakers noted all the  year old familyowned businesses that have recently been forced out of existence and the livelihoods of the people behind them. Meanwhile in the past two years since the speaker has moved back to Seattle shes been stopped by police while walking in the CD six times wearing jeans and a hoodie. Once the officers realized she was a  year old woman not a teenage black boy they stop interrogating and she thinks Well what if I were? Why does just being a black young man require your attention?Neighbors have asked for more police presence in the neighborhood and a crackdown on gang activities like the uptick in random shootings?gt All people want safe and aesthetically pleasing neighborhoods they can walk at all hours but under our system that lacks affordable public housing gentrification forces people out of their home replaced by the children of the folks that locked them in to it. If those six story mixed use buildings were for the people of the neighborhood thered be no conflict.I think this is a socialist rant but I cant tell.,Seattle,cz3n7u3,13,t5_2qhad

6675036,0,t3_47110p,Im not a resident of Nicklesville but Ive been helping with the defense and I can give some background. Nicklesville camps are claimed to be democratically run but theyre really under the thumb of a guy by the name of Scott Morrow whos had a very problematic history running the camps. Hes been abusive to campers including removing bathrooms as punishment forcing folks to protest in exchange for shelter and money mismanagementOne alleged I personally cant confirm what exactly happened reason that he was voted out this time is because he mismanaged two rapes and subsequent suicide attempts that happened at the camps. Rev. Polly Trout the director of another nonprofit in Seattle related to social justice issues has written in favor of waiting to evict too pending a neutral inquiry Thats fair.Whats not fair is that the campers voted Scott Morrow out this is the third time he was voted out of a Nicklesville camp and the reaction of LIHI and SHARE has been to play hardball against them. Theyre being given the choice to reinstate Morrow or get kicked out. No investigation. No arbitration. Nothing.What youre seeing in the original post is a smear campaign against the camp. I was there. The place was clean if a little muddy. There were no drugs. Theres also a strong core group of folks who are helping run the camp right now including providing security.If youre interested in the other side of the story check out Occupy Camp Dearborns facebook page better yet head over there yourself. Its at th and Dearborn right next to the I bridge. Theyre asking for donations of food water AA and AAA batteries and gasoline for generators.Apologies for the wall of text,Seattle,d09r8y1,18,t5_2qhad

6711368,0,t1_d0dhjtx,How can it possibly be equivalent when theres only half as much road? rd was this neighborhoods only good arterial so now there will be none. In service of some th century suburban fantasy about letting your kids play in the street this neighborhood is going to lose a degree of access to the rest of the city because it will take longer to get there. The road diet is increasing the number of places in the city which might as well not exist for all the good they can do us because it would take too long to get there and back. The city is choosing to shrink itself to make itself less valuable as a place to live by reducing the number of people and businesses available to those of us who live here by making it take longer to get to them by slowing the roads down.  Its also making this neighborhood less valuable as a place to do business by reducing the number of potential customers by increasing the time it takes to get here and that reduction in local business profitability will further reduce the quality of life for those of us who live here since we will be stuck dealing with whatever limited array of businesses our own population can support. They wont benefit as much from the larger population around them and neither will we and our ability to vote with our feet and go use better services elsewhere will be reduced since its not like nerfing our street grid is suddenly going to give us more free time to waste on getting around.

Those friends saw a lot of spiders especially during AugustSeptember. They had a pet turtle who loved devouring spiders and she was very wellfed during that time. I personally see spiders very infrequently  maybe once a month if that in the offseason. During spiderseason I usually see a daily spider for a couple of weeks and then it tapers off.

Below the theatres is the Lucky Strike which in the daytime has bowling and games for people of all ages.  Friday night and Saturday night they gradually section off two areas and agecard people to get in and there is dancing and socializing.  There is no cover to get in.  If you are in before they start carding people you are in anywaynot sure if anyone would bother you about being in a wrong place.  You can stay as long or as short as you wish with no cover and no obligation to either purchase drinks drink or dance.  There are chairs and sofas and some people will be sitting on them.  Unless you are scary enough to be the creature from the Black Lagoon other people will greet you and they might be married or single and some of those who greet you will be of the opposite sex to you.  Not sure how often people of the same sex say hi but it probably happens at times especially when a couple greets a couple or a single person.Some people are there dressed sharp to be seen and some are there in business casual or more casual clothing.  No one will push you out or cause problems for you either way . . . and if you are a gal who looks sharp or in a short skirt that draws some attention you will be appreciated.  I think there is a mild minimum dress code to prevent people wearing jeans or other things less than business casual.  I forget the exact rules . . .So it is nearly heaven if you can live with at least wearing above jeans.

People are different here. For the most part it seems like folks that have grown up here get super defensive about the freeze but it exists they just dont experience it because their social groups are established. By in large the friends that I have made here are from other parts of the country. On the flip side I also think that we get a lot of transplants right out of college who expect that meeting people and having folks who will hang out with you will be as simple as it was in school.

Thats a useless statement.Second if you want to play that game every single EU country has a murder rate lower than the US and none of them execute prisoners for any reason and certainly not the mentally ill.Third what youre proposing is an abomination a violation of the rights of human beings.

People expect women to work a little less when they have children.  Ya think?  Especially in the US where theres next to no real maternity.  Its not like people are going to say hey its great you just got stitched up but can you get this project done by am? The data linked is selfreported and the questions could easily introduce a bias.  They also dont show whether men or women are the same in terms of what they expect.Theres still no causation that proves that anything in those two reports are linked. Girls lose interest in STEM?  Are you going to look down on them for having interest in other fields such as healthcare or education where it might be more closely aligned to their value system?There should be absolutely no promotion of one gender or another in ANY field.  The only thing that should be promoted is equal access to education and opportunities.  Its not a problem that less than  of men are nurses.  Its also not a problem that IT fields are a sausage fest.

7389595,0,t1_d2hnikr,gtBecause people like you dont understand how vaccinations work. Thats why I have to worry.Really?gtVaccinations dont provide  immunity to the disease vaccinated against. Im largely pulling this number out of my arsefeeble memory but its often closer to  or .It isnt a guessing game. You can know for sure. All you have to do is get a titer test done. Revaccination is an option if the titer comes back negative for antibodies.Although Im sure you knew that already because you know how vaccinations work.gtThe reason we dont have massive childhood disease epidemics anymore is because widespread immunization has dropped the transmission rate below a sustainable rate for the virus. Each person who gets sick infects less than one other person because most of the people they encounter have been vaccinated and most of those vaccinated people are immune.Are you trying to describe herd immunity? Herd immunity doesnt eliminate outbreaks. It reduces the opportunity for an outbreak.Although Im sure you knew that already because you know how vaccinations work.gtWhere we get into real trouble is when there are enough unvaccinated kids to increase the transmission rate above . Even briefly. Thats when we have an outbreak. And most of the kids who get sick and suffer the consequences were kids whose parents didnt fuck around with their childrens health. The vaccines simply arent  effective on an individual level its only across the broad population that they stop epidemics.You get outbreaks because of vaccinated kids. You get an outbreak when a contagious disease is introduced in to a population. You get an epidemic when there isnt enough people immune to create what has been coined herd immunity.

Lots of people here use them to commute though you will want good rain gear if you want to do so year round.Make sure to brush up on your defensive riding skills from Motorcycle Safety Foundation course or similar drivers around here and the odd road layouts will test them frequently. Its not the aggressive driving style of southern California in Seattle proper though there is some that mixes in from the Bellevue area.And yep you get full access to the carpool lanes and ride toll free in the paid lanes on I and . You will need a GoodGo motorcycle pass though to avoid them sending notices in the mail as the system requires the transponder to know its a motorcycle.Pick up an ORCA card even if you dont use traditional public transit. The same card works to board the ferries here and motorcycles get to board ahead of cars.

7499655,0,t1_d2txhta,gt Locals have been voting down transit and intelligent planning for over  years now. Theyre not educated on how to plan a functioning city it seems.Certainly there were some good options in the past which were voted down and its true that most people arent educated in urban development. That said as I mentioned in my earlier post we should strive for development which is good for all of us. If a plan is not democratically supported then it is at least questionable as to whether it actually is good for all of us us being the locals  the people who live in Seattle and the surrounding area. Finally Ill point out that locals should not be forced to pick between a few poor options i.e. choose the least of two evils  which was essentially the purpose of my earlier post. Of course in some circumstances it may be pragmatic or necessary it hardly seems like a good way of planning a city.gt Then you should probably be protesting all of the new companies bringing tens of thousands of new people here.As I mentioned in my previous post Im not generally opposed to welcoming in new people. I understand that new people moving here will necessarily change the Seattle area. And I am not generally opposed to that either provided the change is in fact for the better for everyone. But there is a part of me which hopes that Seattle can change in a way which is in keeping with its identity.Finally Ill point out that my alleged lack of protesting all new companies does not affect the validity of my experiences thoughts and claims.gt What does this have to do with building more dense housing?In essence my point as far as preserving the Seattle culture environment and heritage goes was that while I am not opposed to more dense housing new development should be handled in a way which does not harm or displace locals and which is in keeping with the spirit of the place.

No person shall drive any vehicle except in the proper lane provided for that purpose and in the proper direction and to the right of the physical barrier median barrier or nopassing zone line on any limited access facility except as provided in Section ...

The low end model is ok in light rain but the speed limiter is kind of a bummer and the annoying beep is the worst part of all. This weekend Im going to open it up and cut the speaker wire. The larger models are better for rougher roads. The small one can be a bit hard to manage especially if the curb ramp is a little steep or if you have uneven pavement from a sidewalk. But my little one has got me all the way up Capitol Hill and covered a  mile round trip from my office to a shop across town in the flats of Redmond. Hills definitely take it out of the battery.The models that have the builtin lights look nice. I found a bike light that I could attach to the handle on mine so I had some visibility when riding in the evening. I plan to ride this thing until I can afford a fancy big one like the Solowheel. I do look forward to a little more speed and better handling on the rougher roads. And I have yet to get a snarky comment but still get at least one or two hey thats cool type comments a week. I am a little embarrassed still though and I try to avoid crowds both for that reason and to avoid hitting anyone. I also manage to crash spectacularly at least once a week usually in the middle of an intersection where everyone can see.

7679815,0,t3_4kfi34,There are some rules you have to adhere to with a service animal. My best friend has a tiny service animal she takes everywhere that alerts her if she is going to have a seizure. Its lbs and almost never leaves her bag in public if we are in a store. She doesnt let people touch the dog unless they ask and even then sometimes she politely declines. The dog is actively working and not to be distracted. Most of the time when she takes the dog into a store people dont even notice. She was able to choose a more hypo allergenic breed to reduce the risk of anyone having a reaction to her service animal. Service animals are supposed to be highly trained. I havent come across a real service animal that would just take a dump wherever it was. You are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal but you are not allowed to ask why or for what disability. My friend still carries a certified card for her dog. When traveling on planes she has a tiny vest the dog wears. There are such things as comfort animals but even those are supposed to be well trained and adhere to code of conduct. It makes me sad that people take advantage of this and it makes everyone with a legitimate need for a comfort or service animal look bad. ,Seattle,d3f5d9y,3,t5_2qhad

7721250,0,t1_d3je50p,Actually its not quite true. It depends.US has excise tax on firearms and ammunition which is  paid by manufacturers. I am not sure why it was imposed but it was probably because someone have persuaded the voters that if Glocks were  more they would be too expensive for murderers to murder with.But of course US government considered the tax too expensive for itself and of course Iraq notwithstanding the government would never murder anyone with guns right? so they exempted themselves and also all levels of local government from the tax.Thus blue label program was born. Under this program gun manufacturers who sell to dealers who promise to sell only to government and law enforcement agencies are exempt from this tax and thus they can and do sell guns  cheaper to under this program.Which allows current and with some limitations former members of police and armed forces to get guns for  less  regardless of whether they are for use at work or for themselves. Which then creates an incentive for these people to resell the guns to other people which then created an interesting Supreme Court case about who was the primary purchaser of the gun which was bought by a  potentially I dont quite remember former  LEO person who immediately resold the gun  through a firearms dealer  to a relative and was found to be guilty of lying on form  when he indicated that he is buying gun for himself but I digress.Anyway all that said to my knowledge Springfield does not have a blue label program so it was most likely not a driver here.,Seattle,d3juq9t,1,t5_2qhad

7758604,0,t1_d3nykhw,Many people choose one restroom and stick with it but many actually do make a choice every time. It depends on factors like how much anxiety that trans person has about using different restrooms how likely it is that that each restroom will be empty how socially conservative are people in that area how many people called them maam vs sir that day etc.The idea of people getting kicked out is silly but it does happen sometimes. Being confronted in a intendedtobefriendly manner is more common hey are you in the right room? but is still super embarrassing because then you have to explain whats up or just assert yourself without elaboration but in a somehow nonsketchy way. Even if these things are more rare in Seattle specifically these stories get passed around so much in trans circles that many trans people carry a lot of restroom fear.Its all compounded by the fact that it can actually be really hard to figure out how people read you when youre midtransition. Many many trans people prefer to use the room that is least likely to result in confrontation regardless of whether thats the mens or womens but assessing yourself for whether you look more like a man or a woman is pretty difficult. Some people always see their true self some cant stop focusing on the signs of their assignedatbirth sex and some always see their own faces as truly androgynous even when  of strangers gender them on one end of the binary. So if you have any reason to suspect that you cant be as objective as a stranger would be in gendering you choosing the leastawkward restroom can be an exercise with a lot of guesswork and stress.,Seattle,d3o3e0m,2,t5_2qhad

7880282,0,t3_4n8ehv,It depends on the person. Personally its totally worth it for me.  I used to live in Cap Hill and now I live in Belltown. The commute isnt really that bad as long as you arent actually planning on driving. I recommend taking the bus to commute across the bridge and take advantage of the carpool and bus lanes and no need to pay toll. But if you plan on driving it will definitely be more stressful. I would recommend finding carpool buddies in that case. That being said I also love living in the city.  Im not so much for suburbia. So a lot of the tradeoffs commute and rent is worth it.  I think everyone should try both lifestyles to see what they like.  At worse you can always move later.Though Cap Hill rent is pretty expensive if you want to actually live in the active part of the Hill. Best price youre gonna get is probably mid teen hundreds for rent alone.  If thats not within your budget you may need to consider other areas in the city andor the east side.

7932687,0,t3_4nx491,Honestly brother I would look into a form of martial arts like BJJ.Many selfdefense classes teach variations of combatives that cannot be mastered in the  hours of instruction youre given. They look cool on a demonstrator who isnt trying to kill you.If you feel like you need the ability to protect yourself NOW apply for a concealed pistol license get yourself a quality firearm and quality holster. Theres plenty of good media that can teach you the basics of the law of selfdefense such as Massad Ayoobs old but still informative VHS tapes that can be found on youtube. You may be antigun you may be progun or indifferent. You may hate the idea of concealing a gun. Oh well if youre not yet a trained martial artist theres the only real shortcut. In a fight for your life you will probably find yourself illequipped until you have trained to proficiency in a martial art and even then you would still rather have a firearm.Selfdefense is a system and a mindset. Carrying a gun will not make you any safer if you cant avoid risky situations. Good verbal communication skills good awareness the ability to handle yourself in a handtohand altercation are also equally important.Probably not the answer you wanted but youre not going to learn anything in a weekend class. If you cant afford to train in a martial art talk to the owner of the gym and try to work something out. There are also tons of people in this subreddit and in the Seattle area who wouldnt mind training you up on firearms.,Seattle,d47pixx,13,t5_2qhad

And if you look at the graph Snohomish was also sending out more than they took in. But yes in general the more urban counties are subsidizing the rural ones. Maybe the state government should place limits on how much revenue can be taken out of one county and spent in another. That would keep a lot more money in King County and go a long way to funding regional transit. ,Seattle,d4969g4,1,t5_2qhad

7971599,0,t1_d4buirs,Another upvote for selfdeprecating humor.As someone who has been employed as a technical and creative writer  and as someone who has received a lot of embarrassing compliments on my writing abilities   Im going to offer you some more wildly improbable critical advice and possibly illadvised encouragement.The compliments I get about my writing are embarrassing because I dont really do anything with the skill beside fucking around online and telling stories for free or the occasional contactcorporate work.Or engaging and berating strangers on the internet. And sometimes encouraging them.You obviously want to write. And thats the start of it. And if you enjoy the process and act of writing thats all that needs to be the end of it damn the critics. Including myself.But that means if you publish blog or not that criticism will happen.And you should also know that journaling and writing just for yourself is a very fine pursuit and practice. Most professional writers write way way more in practice and private than they share or publish.If you still enjoy writing? Fuck everyone else. But criticism is an opportunity to learn to be a better writer or better whatever.And I know where you come from in Coachella Valley and the general Palm Springs area as well as Riverside County the high desert SoCal etc.The area you came from is really quite suburban and shallow and lacking history or culture. Well that part of the desert has a lot of history but they tend to pave over it.I also grew up somewhere very suburban where they tended to pave over history. It took me many many years of wandering adventuring and looking for trouble to break out of that cultural background to get a grasp of what was really going on in the world.And looking at your posts and user history I can also tell you need to not only turn off your TV you need to kill it with a fucking axe and not own one at all.I mean if you really do want to be a writer itll help more than it hurts. I would grant a TV exception for people like Hunter S. Thompson or other ubermensch mutant motherfuckers but he was also likely to shoot his TV rather than watch it as a consumer without a critical eye.Because Im getting a very strong sense based on your writing and user commentpost history  no wait bear with me Im actually really good at this  that you dont read enough books that you havent read enough books yet. Because you cant really read a book and watch TV at the same time.That you need to read Mark Twain and Kurt Vonnegut and Theodore Sturgeon and Margret Atwood and Sherri S. Tepper and many many more authors.And  last  one of the things you might not know about Seattle is that it is basically the most literary bookish large city in North America.And e love our books our libraries and our writers. Youre facing a tough critical market in this area if you want to actually make money writing.There are only so many writers that make a living doing it and it takes dedication and practice and craft not halfcocked blog posts backed by a bit of advertising.,Seattle,d4c301a,2,t5_2qhad

A person who beat their slave to death could go to God with a clean conscience as long as they followed this guideline. This guideline doesnt stand alone. It was one backstop rule with a harsh penalty. There is literally nowhere to draw the line perfectly.gt If its some sort of weird compromise on Gods part based on what he thought a morally primitive culture would accept why on earth do people still claim its his perfect word to live by!?This isnt the sole guideline for all time.

If you are Jewish and a Christian there is a biblical argument that you are NOT exempt from Jewish religious law.  Paul at times goes along with this but at other times he does not.  What James and Paul agreed on was that Gentiles did not have to follow Jewish law Council of Jerusalem but note that as a Jew Paul purifies himself at the temple after that council.  As a Jew he was still under the law nothing changed that.  Yet in Galatians he has an issue when Peter a fellow Jew refused to eat with Gentiles so he goes the other direction!.  If you understand Jewish expectations for Gentiles this is not controversial at all Jewish Christians continue to follow Jewish law just like Jesus and Gentile Christians do not follow Jewish law only those laws that apply to all mankindTrust me I fully understand that a founding principle of Judaism is that Yahweh favors one group of people over another based on their race.  Im just free enough that by definition this makes Yahweh a racist godracist having or showing the belief that a particular race is superior to another.As you can imagine this is not a popular opinion even though a unbiased and literal reading of scripture should lead one to no other conclusion.  That is one of  many reasons I dont usually engage in conversations like this any more.

They get a lot of attention because white people identify with being shot at college or in a movie theater  but  of gun violence is done with handguns and much of that within the context of poverty and crime and the victims are largely brown...and the white majority couldnt care less about that. Gun control advocates like to focus on scary rifles which are used in less than  of gun crimes because the problems that lead to the majority of gun violence are fare more complex and difficult to fix.

Most of the parade route is  people deep from the front row.A chair is really a liability unless you really like chairs or plan on sitting on it away from the parade line. And I too like folding chairs but at this event the crowds are so dense along the route that even carrying it around is a tough thing to do.Most people generally stand or walk along the parade route and explore.Also many apartment buildings and groups of people who live along the route tend to reserve some major amount seating for building or block parties. Some of which have been running for years or even decades.And I think this priority access is actually a good thing. A lot of the buildings along the route are for now a mix of low and high income housing and there are many many LGBT people who live there in both housing segments and some of these organized areas are hosted or organized by old characters or figures from the LGBT communities.A very large number of the people from outside the neighborhood who show up super early to get front row seats actually know and are supporting people in the parade and a surprisingly large fraction of these enthusiastic early birds are also people who happen to live in the neighborhood and know people or groups in the parade.And its really kind of awesome and beautiful when you figure out whats actually going on that theres actually a living community along the route having a party right on their front porch or stairs to their building.,Seattle,d4ntr8v,3,t5_2qhad

8086337,0,t1_d4oo4ej,For some reason I think the new undergrad attitude in CS is that they wont need to know all of this stuff because nobody builds these data structures and algorithms from the ground up anymore right? They totally just use a library for everything right? Completely misunderstanding the entire field. Also there is also the freshman problem of If I can get through this semester Ill learn it and be prepared for the next semester. Or some combination of these two things. Also lots of gamers who start CS because they want to make video games. Often the problems with these students is that theyre either missing the interest in actual CS or a natural aptitude for it which means its going to take more time to learn and many are not willing to put that time in.I think similar problems affect a smaller group of entrepreneurial types who want to start a startup but have more interest in the businessmaking money side and less in the CS. But Ive only had a couple of these students. I also had a student who tried to justify using code he found online and lifting book answers word for word off of a website to me during recitation. I didnt even engage him I just mentioned that we caught some people cheating and that the professor asked me to discuss it with them. This was very strange because he actually seemed completely competent. The problem was he spent all of his time writing code for a company he used to work at in Saudi Arabia and decided he didnt need to spend time on his homework which for someone of his experience probably wouldnt have taken much time at all although the book problems may have since hed only been exposed to programming before.TLDR Its really common because many people who go into CS have no idea what theyll be doing.,Seattle,d4oz7v6,3,t5_2qhad

I feel like me calling  because my neighbor is having a loud party at am is not the same thing as a guy walking down the street waving a gun around if youre saying theyre both the same wise then why have a nonemergency number at all?I think this an important clarification here since the uSeattlePD account has said  should be called for safety issues and to report crimes in progress but then uAmericanDerp links to a post where you seem to be advocating calling  to report having a picture of a kid doing graffiti many hours previously  a situation where a crime is neither in progress nor is there a safety issue seems like prime nonemergency number territory to me.

What Victoria does or doesnt do in a variety of regards is one thing but the article rightly pointed out regardless of the authors intentions that WA is in no position to be casting stones when we literally ignore our worst sources of the most damaging pollutants.  That article among others pointed out how we including our public agencies have always disregarded any findings that didnt fit the prepackaged narrative set forth by whoever was in the Governors office or influential enough in congress.  You keep mentioning the spending weve done but youre still not getting that penanceviawallet isnt what cleans up a Soundriverlakestreametc alone.  Weve had decades of leaders raising fees and creating restrictions on everyone and everything but the key contributors to the problem.  The best sewage treatment plants in the world not that we have anything of the sort at any reasonable scale would only marginally help compared to forcing the hand of those that are the greater source of the problems.

They offered limited breakfast amp lunch to go with the coffee.But it closed eventually so that the owner could pursue other passions and reopened as the most pretentious coffee shop I have ever seen.They dont have food because it should be about the coffee.They barely offer milk to add to it and the coffee is served in a wineglass instead of a satisfying mug because we want people to taste the aromatics swirl it around and see the color What if I already know what color coffee is?Im glad that after graduating with their degrees in Art History and Underwater Basket Weaving the pair were able to get their mom to bankroll their new project but a space that offers community and croissants is more appealing than a coffee bar that doesnt think its a big deal to run out of anything resembling milk and actually makes horrible coffee but its like The Emperors New Clothes to get anyone to admit it. ,Seattle,d5ndo07,2,t5_2qhad

8525781,0,t3_4wi649,Fellow UW bio alum here! I feel like I can talk a bit about the market for junior devs as Ive been looking since June and finally got an offer the other day for a EntryLevel Software Dev at a startup! A little about me I graduated uw with bio and then went on to take Oregon State Universitys postbac Computer Science program done online. The degree definitely helped me get noticed and get me to the phone screens portions for most companies but I know there were plenty of startups who were interviewing selftaught candidates as well. After you get to the phone screens its all about what personalprofessional projects you may have worked on and if you seem competent enough during the coding interviews. So having some projects to talk about is definitely helpful. I absolutely tanked a lot of the first few technical interviews I had however do study up on those! While theres no shortage of jobs for software devs in Seattle most of them will be for midsenior level positions. There are certainly entrylevel positions in Seattle however it feels like there is a lot of competition for those entry level jobs around here and you really do have to shine through the interviews to  land somewhere. I agree with most other people though dont underestimate the power of having great connections networking and just getting yourself out there!

My SO is small in stature and doesnt carry yet but knows how to put out a dont fuck with me vibe and yet be kind and approachable to those who are kind and respectful. Much of what you said above goes into my mentality as well Know your surroundings be respectful of other be deliberate in your actions deescalate whenever possible and when necessary be ready to be the the most violent person in the room. I mention this last one because while you are correct that most aggressors are cowards and will back down when confronted not all will youll get that  in  that grew up with an abusive family forgot to take their meds just lost their house etc. that will be willing to take it further and you need to have the willingness to take it to n to get home alive.

8768810,0,t3_4z4tud,Thanks so much everyone. Great suggestions. I had an amazing time. I compiled what you wrote here as well as my research and other recommendations for anyone else looking for things to do in Chelan.If you are visiting Chelan during peak season or are on a budget I recommend staying outside of town. Wenatchee isnt too far  minute drive and has a few decent accommodation options and is fairly accessible. If your hotelmotel options have a continental breakfast by all means enjoy it. If you are going to have breakfast in Chelan or neighboring Manson good options are the Blueberry Hills Farm expect long lines but worth it Riverwalk Caf or the Apple Cup. Chelan is a small town and businesses tend to close at conservative hours. For late night fun check out Chelan Lanes Bowling open until midnight on weekends or the Mill Bay Casino in Manson  hours. You cant plop down a floatie or swim everywhere on Lake Chelan. There are a few drop points you can do so. Best spots includeLakeside ParkDon Morse Park has paid parking only  for two hoursWillow Point ParkLake Chelan State ParkTake a relaxing stroll around Riverwalk Park.I also recommend a pitstop at Slidewaters the fun waterpark in Chelan. Three hours is plenty of time to spend there and ride everything. There is a hour ticketing option available for the last three hours of park operation  referred to either as the Afternoon Plunge or PM Plunge available at a reduced rate. The waterpark is very clean and wellmaintained the slides are fun and there are some relaxing water options including the lazy river and hot spa. Great lunch stops include Local Myth Pizza and the charming Lake View Drive In.Lake Chelan Artisan BakeryDinner stops include Campbells restaurant a bit pricey but great views Alpenhorn Caf Andante romantic Italian place Lake Chelan Winery great BBQ and nice place for wine tastings. Tin Lilly Pub is also fun.If you have a day or halfday to spend and dont mind an early wake up time take the Lady of the Lake to Stehekin only accessible by water and enjoy the town.,Seattle,d71rk9x,1,t5_2qhad

Theyre looking to pass it.gtThen the bill is likely to go through Council Member Sally Bagshaws human services committee which next meets on September  at  p.m. Bagshaw has been outspoken about wanting to better protect homeless people from sweeps but also has a close relationship with the mayor. This will test her loyalties. gtReal Changes Harris told The Stranger the coalition has commitments from a majority of city council members to support the legislation.

8879822,0,t3_51t04l,First I think the SeaHawks have the full right to do whatever they want during the national anthem and I support their right to do what they want. Richard Sherman can wipe his ass with the flag while Russell Wilson sets it on fire and I defend their right to do that all the way. Thats what America is about.Second fuck the SeaHawks who are grandstanding posers and acting like jackasses if this story is true. Your right to protest isnt a right to freedom from the consequences of your protest and I hope all those mothefuckers lose all their endorsement deals for disrespecting the flaganthem or trying to use it for other purposes than just recognizing our country in a moment of unity before an event. The anthem has always been to me a moment to pause and think lets all remember this game is meaningless and now these fucknards are just trying to make it about themselves regardless of what they do. And dont disrespect the anthem in a group after someone else already did the hard part of doing it alone. This is just cowards pretending to be brave.Third I bet the NFL is shitting themselves and good football sucks anyway. The idea of the cognitive dissidence of a stereotypical Murica!  football fans who see their heroes disrespecting the flaganthem is a giant party in my heart.

9073415,0,t3_53ts1e,The best thing about high speed rail is that its green and doesnt require burning thousands of gallons of fossil fuels to provide safe speedy transportation.Its also a good idea because the cheapest segments could be built first which is also the longest stretch between Marysville and the Canadian border.Between Marysville and Seattle is another story but its possible to use alternative transportation or simply complete the sounder further north into snohomish county while the first segment is in use.Not only will this relieve congestion on I north and south of seattle it will have a great economic impact by lowering the price of air travel at the same time reducing the need to put more polluting jets into the air and lowering ticket prices for people flying to Asia through Vancouver. Increasing competition and reducing demand for air travel will have a great benefit to everyone especially the environment if high speed rail is built.This will take cars off the roads between here and Canada and between Seattle and SeaTac when travelers can simply take the ground transportation alternative and increase tourism to and from BC.SeaTac carries like Delta would be forced to compete with BC prices which are usually  cheaper than SeaTac international rates. High speed rail is win all around for the region.To the opponents who say that driverless cars or air travel are the answer it would take you longer to board and taxi in a plane that it would for the entire trip on high speed rail that doesnt even count the time spent in the air and the considerable air and noise pollution of those jets. As far as driverless cars subsidies that will only benefit the auto manufacturer in the short term because people dont own cars forever while the high speed rail line would operate for many decades. More cars on the road would contribute heavily to congestion as well.,Seattle,d82h73u,1,t5_2qhad

9273553,0,t3_57f1i5,Seattle has undergone a radical transformation in the last  years. Lots of people are moving here to work in tech. Thats driving up the demand for housing. The median house price is k. Average rent for a one bedroom is k. New unit construction hasnt kept pace. I think I saw a slide that said  people move to Seattle every day but we only build  housing units a day. Its also been difficult to build affordable housing. The city proposed rezoning certain areas for duplexes and higher density housing but homeowners have pushed back killing the proposal.The same people also killed microhousing a lowcost option popular with millennials and those starting out on their own.Another factor is minimum parking requirements. This requires that developers include parking in the construction of housing. A study concluded that this raises rent by .There is also foreign and speculative investment in the Seattle housing market. Vancouver so much so that they imposed a foreignbuyer tax last month. So now investors are looking at Seattle.Thats just housing. Granted there are many other factors but Seattles inability to embrace density at the pace of its booming economy is one the most visible changes in the city that makes it difficult to keep a roof over ones head.,Seattle,d8rhmev,35,t5_2qhad

Probably in favor of feds remaining in power on the matter. On the other hand some states have chosen to issue drivers licenses to illegal immigrants  something with which I do not agree  and I havent heard anything about any lawsuits over that.

Tell the people who have to wait  hours a day in traffic just to get to work because of Inslees failed toll express lane experiment. Tell the homeless people of Seattle that times are good. The amount of money we spend on homelessness statewide and in Seattle keeps going up. In Seattle homelessness has exploded in spite of all this money. We spend k per homeless person in Seattle and nothing to show for it. Inslee is clearly a failed governor his first term.

9834119,0,t1_dapdsxz,How do you know that Schultz knew that Bennet and Co would move the team to OKC? Like I said before Schultz is a smart man and I would assume that he would not sell the Sonics to someone who would move the team out of Seattle. Seems like you are making a pretty drastic assumption there. And Im not sure I understand your second point. Are you saying that even with a combination of a horrible NBA team  one of the lowest fan attendances in the league is not a viable way to judge the financial status of a basketball team? Do you know something here that Schultz didnt when he sold the team? Do you suggest that he should have kept it for longer and he would have made a lot more money if he decided to sell it?Yes the reason fan attendance was down for several years was because the team sucked. Yes Seattle fans are known for being bandwagon fans. In what way did Schultz run the team that produced a very bad outcome? Regardless of the state of the art remodel that was made in the mid s the arena needed more improvements. The public voted against that. Of course there are many factors that led to the team moving. But I have a hard time believing that if the public actually cared about the Sonics at that time They didnt I remember. It was worse than the support we see for the Mariners now that Schultz would have sold the team. I really believe that the combination of the low fan attendance  one of the worst NBA records during those seasons  the public voting against the new arena The last straw were the main reasons he sold the team. ,Seattle,dapep3u,2,t5_2qhad

10346234,0,t1_dcges1v,I appreciate you citing a peer reviewed article and did not downvote you.Personally I believe helmets do reduce cyclists risk of brain injury or death to some extent. However the same can be said for drivers wearing helmets but driving is not dangerous enough to necessitate helmet use. The main reason we believe urban bike commuting is dangerous is public perception and this is not a scientific measure. In fact this real science says cycling is just as safe as walking and drivingSo what is missing from the wiley article is evidence that urban commuting specifically is dangerous enough on a bike to necessitate helmet use. The abstract contains some gross numbers of injuries across all states but makes no comparison of injury rates with other modes of transport.

10646975,0,t1_dde4lbe,gt Im convinced most SJWs dont even really believe what they say or think but its more about just being accepted by peer groups.Exactly. I actually got kicked out of my Community Colleges Triangle Club LGBT club a few years ago because of the SJW bs. She screamed that I outed her to a bunch of friends to the staff and that they teased her and were no longer her friends but the reality was that she didnt like that I was questioning her pangender claim and she didnt like it she also didnt like that I wanted to keep my male sex. Staff kicked me out and called my advisor because Im vocal about being a clinical psychologist and I had to defend my degree choice in front of one of my teachers if this would reflect how I would handle HIPPA Law etc. I was actually facing expulsion because of her lies. They couldnt prove either story so I had to leave the club but was allowed to stay in school. Fast forward a year and this same gal outs a gay guy acquaintance of mine to his highly conservative family because he said he wasnt attracted to black men and this offended her. It was only then that she was kicked out of the club. However she got to stay in school and the guy had to drop out of school move out of his house with no money and still hasnt talked to much of his family in the three years since. Oh and every one of her SJW buddies were applauding her abusing us and fighting the clubs decision to kick her out. I was putting my foot down on the SJW crap but this one really did it for me.,Seattle,dde5jh4,1,t5_2qhad

11017046,0,t1_degnftb,gt abortion Really so you think it should be up to the women to decide whether she can kill a human life or not. Ok I know we wont agree here so I wont even try. Thats not a right that is given by the US. That is a made up basic human right that you hear people preach about. Basic Human right can be anything. Some people think that includes housing food internet cars.Right because that would require you to read and critically consider the ethical debate arguments in favor of limited abortion legalization.  The reason that abortions are and will always be legalized in the United States comes down to the balance of issues between society the fetus and the woman.  There are no cohesive logical ethics arguments that argue for abortions being illegal  of the time which is the typical position of prolifers.  The only arguments for abortions being illegal for most situations must ignore the benefits to societyCrime reduction statistics among other things must attribute no value to the freedom or future quality of life of the womansee oppression of women must attribute no value to future potential children of the woman and must attribute  of the balance of the issue in favor of the future possible life of the fetusNone of the ethical dilenations of what qualifies as alive or notalive support the idea that a fetus at every point is alive in the normal sense of the word.Theres also nothing in the bible so far as I have found that supports the prolife position despite the fact that so many conservativesrepublicans are religious christians.  The prolife position seems to come down to a matter of punishing behavior that prolifers deem immoralintercourse out of wedlock casual sex etc and controlling womens behaviors.  Im sure you wont agree but if you really looked at everything theres no other logic behind it.gt racism and segregation... It was the democrats who actually made the Jim Crow laws that you are referring too. It was the religious right and social conservatives.  Those people now vote Republican nearly  of the time and most of them are still racist.  The biggest fundamental reason for the Obama hate was that he was a black liberal.gt Really you going to believe they all just woke up one day and wanted to switch sides on a fundamental idea.No it took more than  years.  Check the voting trends for southern states which began as purely and  Democrat and wound up as purely and  Republican.  Clearly history agrees with the teachers who said they switched sides.gt You dont want to hunt an animal for food I said nothing about my position and Im fine with hunting for food purposes.  Thats not why people hunt today mostly though many do also eat the animal.  Im more interested in those hunting for sport who dont eat the animal or those who break game warden rules on hunting seasons for sustainable populations.

11125091,0,t1_desroo4,gtWhy should the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT help out with a small local problem like this?For the exact same reason that the feds have ever gotten involved in racial issues around the country. And it wasnt like one piece of graffiti was tagged and everyone lost their minds the article points out the multiple faith centers in the city who have been affected recently but the spike in these kinds of crimes and are concerned for their congregations and the public so I think calling it just graffiti is downplaying it. Pastor Anthony Steele of Allen AME Church in Tacoma said other AME churches received threats after a  Charleston church shooting that left nine people dead. Volunteer Black Panthers guard his church now he said.There have also been recent antiMuslim incidents in the Seattle area. Annelah Afzali runs the American Muslim Empowerment Network. She said acts against various faith communities can be related.The feds intervened in local race related incidents during the civil rights movement and racial violence of s the issues in Seattle thankfully havent escalated that far yet but you dont exactly have to go digging on shaddy forums to find advocates of the kind of violence taking place back then or look back that far to find examples of these sorts of hate crimes going much further around the country. We will see what her office sends out and maybe it will be a reasonable request and maybe it wont but  gtMaybe she meant for a country wide task force which might be about as useful as the war against drugs.What? The war on drugs is ineffective because drug abuse is a recurrent health and socioeconomic issue as much as a criminal one hate crimes and bomb threats to synagogues are not. Did you just come up with a political action you deemed ineffective to throw into your argument or something or do you actually see a parallel?And btw considering these sorts of incidents are happening in multiple areas of the country funds and staff dedicated to it nationally would make sense On Feb.  a bomb threat forced the evacuation of a Jewish community center on Mercer Island. That was part of several waves of threats aimed at Jewish institutions across the country. If there was a sudden spike vandalism threats and hate speech towards Catholics at multiple distinct locations throughout the country would a task force seem like overreach then?gtJust because you dont get what you want doesnt mean its evidence of the government not caring about race relations.Its not really about what I want its about what these effected communities are asking for which is security and investigations into the crimes to help prevent more of them which is completely reasonable. Considering that Trump has an antisemite on his cabinet and has often hesitated to distance himself from the altright white supremacist movement or leaders like Richard Spencer and David Duke is concerning along with his distinct lack of tact or awareness of racial history like not mentioning Jews during holocaust memorial day or him and Sean Spicer not seeming to know who Fredick Douglas is or that hes dead outside of the fact hes a black figure Trump has made a lot of his recent speechwork about how bad and violent our inner cities are well this is a way he could actually help with that very issue since he obviously believes its so bad that he would talk about it in the way he has I dont think its unreasonable or unfair to ask for federal assistance in that issue and it would seem rather odd to ignore such requests made around the country when his words stake so much on them.,Seattle,det0pyh,6,t5_2qhad

11287797,1,t3_612f3d,The Republicans will say how this sort of thing creates a culture of dependence and thats why we dont need social welfare programs. As if cutting people off from this will suddenly make them entrepreneurs and business leaders! Heres a thought. What do you get when workers are paid living wages and can not only support themselves and save for the future? You get people who can take care of themselves. They have money to buy homes or rent apartments and companies are happy to do business with them. The only government oversight needed is basic regulation. Where do they live? They can handle it. What do they eat? They can handle it. Where do they work? The jobs are there. Drop the jobs down to poverty wages and still not have enough to go around and people no longer have the means to take care of themselves. The welfare programs meant to lend a helping hand in times of trouble become a permanent fixture in their lives because the troubles never go away. And were going to blame the poor for that? Solutions like this treat the symptom without looking at the disease. Why are people homeless? Sure youll have mental cases who dont have a place in the psych hospitals after Reagan closed them down. Youll have alcoholics and drug addicts who cant get their shit together some people who dont want to work. But how many more are sane ablebodied and unable to make it in this economy through now fault of their own? These are people who would no longer be homeless if they had jobs. We keep getting told that the jobs have gone away theyre never coming back. Well if thats the case were going to have to start looking at a basic living income because the alternative isnt going to fly. I do think its possible to live more simply than were accustomed to. The cost of housing is ridiculous and we dont allocate resources effectively. Having an empty townhome in a nice part of town because its a nice investment for a foreign millionaire may make economic sense but it doesnt make moral sense. I think that tiny homes connected to the grid could be the kind of stopgap we need. Keep the cost of living low keep them near transit routes so the residents have access to jobs itll give people a sense of dignity and control over their lives. The Republican strategy seems to be make being poor and homeless so miserable people will choose to become rich instead or just disappear. Its a ridiculous and heartless fantasy. ,Seattle,dfbgeq9,2,t5_2qhad

Ive only done one of these cruises but I think they tend to be on the smaller ships because you cant get into places like Glacier Bay with the super large newer ships. This likely means they dont have all the extra things like rock climbing walls zip lining etc. Being that it is Alaska you can probably find these sorts of activities at each port though.

You arent happy with your tax money.  Most Latinos live east of the mountains and you rSeattle liberal humans cant be illegal guy are nothing but bitter about the east taking taxes but not giving their fare share back.

Shut up and dont worry about it you didnt lose your place in line.  You still get to wait just as long as before so dont complain.  Theyre just human being like you who dont believe in doing things the right way.  They prefer their first act in this country to be breaking the law and not standing behind you because it sucks and some of them have criminal backgrounds that would disqualify them.  But hey. were just one big happy earth family right?  You say Im a hypocrite but no the idea of sneaking into another country would never cross my mind just like when I was poor and hungry I never decided to break into someones house and steal shit.  Now that might be different if that other country was America and I knew that about half of them dont give a shit anyway and I knew plenty of people who had gotten away with it.

11607949,0,t3_65k1sn,I spend a LOT of time outdoor urban time in Seattle. Layers as many have stated are critical. If your walks are long you need a REAL waterproof raincoat many arent. Arcteryx makes great ones but theyre painfully expensive one possible way to save is theres an Arcteryx outlet store in N. Vancouver BC that can save you a lot of money especially if youre flexible on color. Of course Im sure there are also good nonArcteryx cheaper alternatives too.One other consideration with raincoats is if youre between sizes maybe size up that way you can wear a compact backpack inside your jacket and keep everything dry. Failing that if you dont want to invest in a watertight backpack Kindles fit in Quart Ziplocs and most laptops fit in a gallon Zipbag buy brucerygmail.com at Cash amp Carry a local commercial grocer.My pick for winterrain shoes are Brooks GoreTex running shoes. The Ghost is more of a traditional running shoe and the Cascadia is a trail shoe with better treadtraction. Both will keep your feet dry.Lastly Outdoor Research makes gloves with waterproof slipon outers to keep your hands dry. Protip the outers will also fit over other nonOutdoor Research gloves too if you size correctly so you can choose the warmth level you like.Hope this helps.,Seattle,dgbrrli,1,t5_2qhad

This leader of . trillion is already lowering our national debt and forcing stateside companies to stay stateside while punishes others that take their business outside the US.  How would pushing a tax cut massively benefit him if his focus is the middle class? This just makes no sense.Everything He may say he has done other than getting rid of Obamacare.  He said he wanted more control on the illegal immigration problem and its gone down alot wall hasnt even been built he said he wanted companies to keep their businesses in America and they are starting to do just that he said he wanted to kill ISIS fighters and thats happening.  All of these items are benefiting Americans what is this very significantly benefiting him deal? Hes the president I hope boosting the economy and taking care of his people is a benefit.  Are you taking about Trump already being rich and wants even more money?  What benefit I just dont get this way of thinking.It was blocked by Hawaii lol.  I see other states abiding by it. It was a pushing narrative move.  No refugee would go to Hawaii thats a complete joke.  Its expensive and they even send poor homeless people back to the mainland on a oneway ticket.

Most of the people fleeing war are not truly fleeing that they are coming to Europe and America for the economic opportunities and social benefits.  Syrians dont care about Trump blocking them from escaping war they want their home back noone wants to uproot their life and come to something totally different.  Watch the video it explains what Im trying to convey.The  Tomahawk missiles blowing up a specific chemical weapon cache isnt going to war.  Noone has declared war we are not invading Syria.  I dont see where you are seeing we are at war with that.  We are at war with ISIS and its organizations.  He said from the beginning he was going to kill ISIS.  Thats what is happening.
