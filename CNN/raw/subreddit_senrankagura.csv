5275712,0,t3_3n5a8w,I gave up on trying to  burst because the extreme fps lag made it hard to control and the game just felt slow. I started playing SK yesterday and I love it. It feels so damn smooth and responsive compared to burst. I dont know if the physical of burst was laggy or not but NA didnt get a choice so I had to get the digital and it runs like garbage. The graphics in SK are a lot better too. The only frustrating part in SK is the camera. It makes it hard to attack what you want to attack and I dont think I understand the lock on system yet.,senrankagura,cvm161s,2,t5_2w2y1
5278055,0,t1_cvm90l6,In SK what do I do about the other shinobis attacks getting through mine? It is very annoying to take damage when I am clearly beating the crap out of them. ,senrankagura,cvmbyz3,1,t5_2w2y1

6094056,0,t3_3z0e25,The series is full of retcones and continuity errors. I mean the hebijo story in burst doesnt fit with the Hanzo side. And Shinovi Versus also doesnt really fit with SK. So just bear with it SK is still a really good game and I think its the best in the series,senrankagura,cyibxoq,3,t5_2w2y1

6579036,0,t3_45sbk0,Not really but I think you can gain a better understanding of the worldcharacters by going Hanzo Gessen and Hebijo. But its ultimately up to you. Heck you can actually switch between schools if you are curious for one side over another.,senrankagura,czztqyo,1,t5_2w2y1
6902745,0,t1_d0yol8p,Funny enough I think the first time I heard about this game was when the Super Best Friends did an episode of Creepy Anime Bullshit with an import copy of Estival Versus. I looked at it for about  minutes and was like welp Im sold.,senrankagura,d0yqtsn,2,t5_2w2y1
6910108,1,t1_d0zei2q,I mean this isnt like someone wanting to do theater when all their friends are into sports. This is the game where you can strip the clothes off of high school ninja girls. I dont think Im the only one who considers this game a guilty pleasure.,senrankagura,d0zkxi6,-1,t5_2w2y1
6917092,0,t1_d1051lw,Dude lighten up. The devs are having fun with it and so was I about a series that is about ninja girls stripping each other in terms of gameplay as a main mechanic. Besides we all know every Senran Kagura fan isnt like that. I fully admitted I play more for story and characters too for gods sake! And no not the mask that part I love. Its the friggin armor that doesnt really cover much and her boobs flopping about as she has pastiesbra bandages on them. And armor doesnt exactly have half boob socks that actually makes the armor even worse for protection.,senrankagura,d10dj2g,0,t5_2w2y1

8020854,0,t1_d4ha5tv,EDIT Dont worry about the mountain of text its much better than being on a forum and only getting one line responses. Thanks for that. I thought the rebirth thing was how many times the card was killed in combat  HP and revived when you returned to the game menu page.Currently up to Chapter  now and yeah I noticed the funny translation  one Senran comes up as Brewers Swallow and Tsun. Quite surprised how much variety of the cards there are still aiming to get Yumi. I think I once got  of the same card in a row did I break thee RNG?.I remember in KanColle you could buff your ships by fusing together different spare ships so I see that mechanic carries over to NewWave. Unfortunately the translation function on my phones google chrome seems to be buggy  if Im too fast or I dont let it fully translate the page it becomes jammed. Maybe I get temp banned from using the API I dunno.,senrankagura,d4hmb79,1,t5_2w2y1
8089044,0,t1_d4pa2l9,Thats true. Theyre slapping her on to everything. I dont dislike her but I wish the other girls got more love too.,senrankagura,d4pa6mi,1,t5_2w2y1

8409229,0,t1_d59rm4b,Total issue with a lot of animestyle design in general. Too many creators afraid of giving their characters blemishes beyond attractive beauty marks like moles varying musculature weight differences facial structure ethnicity etc...you would think that a series with so much nudity they would give them more defining characteristics beyond their clothing but I guess they give that job to the hair. ,senrankagura,d5sp5xm,1,t5_2w2y1

11176163,0,t1_dexjboo,Ayane as Yagyu is done well. If she only had Yagyuus face measurements and moveset shed be perfect.Ayane was stylized to look like a Senran for her DLC in Estival Versus. A DoA character model for an SK character wouldnt be too jarring. Itd be like the outfit DLC but with the characters actual appearance to match.,senrankagura,deyt0co,2,t5_2w2y1
