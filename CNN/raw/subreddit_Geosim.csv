8447963,0,t1_d5xgqbm,We recognize the Bulgarian position but would like to remind them that the world rarely responds positively to the acquisition of foreign territory solely for the purpose of protecting the interests of ones own ethnic group. Look for example to the continued diplomatic distrust by many over the Russian invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula to protect the ethnic Russians at the expense of Ukrainians and other groups in the region. We caution that there are other ways to ensure the protection of a group other than the annexation or invasion of territory and to treat a region as a homogeneous unit based solely on its more abundant ethnic population may quickly lead to other nations and those within ones country taking issue with the treatment of other minority groups.We understand the desire to ensure the protection and safety of Bulgarians abroad but there are many cases where the nation of Bulgaria may not be in the most direct or favorable position to protect those individuals and ask that the nation of Bulgaria consider their hard position on the issue carefully before making demands.M You make good arguments man this should be fun for us all to hammer out if the Romanian Civil War ever finally gets resolved!,Geosim,d5xj6fk,1,t5_39wjl

Black Sky was supposed to take place after the completion of the BlackClass Interdiction Submarines however when the summit was announced I came up with the ideas of the invasion happening more quickly as the nationalist party is actually secretly fracturing into multiple smaller parties. With the recent assassination of the President a new elected ruler merged the roles of Assembly Speaker and President into one vladetel or Ruler. This guy is WAY less warmongering and more of an olive branch speaker however he is still a nationalist and a massive anticommunist.

8756751,0,t1_d708jek,Despite the failure of a lasting political union the sense of shared history and the hope for eventual reunification persist in the nations formerly in the union. Various attempts were made to reunite Central America in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries but none succeeded for any length of timeA second attempt was made in October  when El Salvador Honduras and Nicaragua created a Federation of Central America Federacin de Centro Amrica. The union lasted less than a month.In  the region successfully established a military coalition to repel an invasion by U.S. freebooter William Walker.Guatemalan President General Justo Rufino Barrios attempted to reunite the nation by force of arms in the s but he died in battle near the town of Chalchuapa El Salvador.A third union of Honduras Nicaragua and El Salvador as the Greater Republic of Central America or Repblica Mayor de Centroamrica lasted from  to .The latest attempt occurred between June  and January  when El Salvador Guatemala Honduras and Costa Rica formed a second Federation of Central America. The treaty establishing this federation was signed at San Jos Costa Rica on January  .The treaty stipulated for the future creation of one state of all the four signatories under one constitution.All of these failed due to lack of local economic and political stability which has been diminishing as time goes on. Also a stronger and more economically powerful base of wealth The huge growth found in Panama and Costa Rica from the s to now would be able to get more done. The DR is also in SICA which is the only reason theyre included in these votes. I dont expect them to join a union. Many efforts have been made to unite these regions who have really no reason to be apart. These nations dont hate each other at all Im not even sure where you got that from. Really theyve just been backwaters for a long time and I believe that due to huge amounts of growth from all nations in South America that they probably picked up some of that too.These nations have become endlessly more literate and connected to the western world than they were the last time they fought each other and Im sure that trend would continue into the s. Also with the amount of connections that have gone on in just about  years with SICA I imagine that some more would have gotten done between then and now. ,Geosim,d7093io,1,t5_39wjl

We find that these cultures separatists movements are blinded by nationalism because independence gets them nowhere. Spain will provide autonomy in the form of educational autonomy allowing the regions of these peoples to modify their requirements such as requiring specific cultural history and the study of their regional language rather than Spanish. Spain is also willing to remove all official languages removing the burden of learning spanish from the autonomous regions if the people choose so.
