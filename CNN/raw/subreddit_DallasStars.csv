7369286,0,t1_d2ftn6g,Ill try not to be an annoying nerd about stats around here if I continue to hang out cause I am loving your team but choking with a huge lead can be attributed to this shit called score effectsWhenever somebody in the NHL has a lead they start trying to protect it and get shot at more. Combination of them being more cautious and the other team being more desperate I guess.Upside is that the team that scores first when the score is tied at the beginning of the game is almost always the stronger team.If they get demoralized if the other team scores due to score effects they may lose a game but they have way more potential....and thats why I like the Dallas Stars? Insert other shit about high event hockey here too.ETA Possibly its a matter of Ruff realizing that hes onto something and the Stars need to learn to retreat into the shell less because theyre not built for defense and go ahead and score  goals. ,DallasStars,d2fu4vx,30,t5_2ro4p

7400567,0,t1_d2jd0w1,I definitely think the national perception of this series is that the Blues are over the hurdle now and will make quick work of the Stars. I think that notion is foolish. This series isnt going less than six. You are right that the Blues have only seen a rested Stars team once which was the epic shootout battle the day after Christmas. On the same token the Stars havent seen a healthy Blues roster this year either. Game  of the playoffs was the first game we have had a healthy roster all year. So in a way this series will be the first time both teams are seeing each other at full strength hopefully Seguin can get back soon. This really should be a great series. After the emotional drain of beating our rivals in  games I am just looking forward to some good hockey between these two clubs.,DallasStars,d2je92x,6,t5_2ro4p

We always talk about how the playoffs matter soooo much more than the regular season and then we get people who want to ship Kari out over Niemi even though He was absolute trash in the playoffs,DallasStars,d4p9146,1,t5_2ro4p
8135018,0,t1_d4uaush,Tbf Niemi is a perfectly sound league average goalie.BUT he needs a structured traditional defense to be successful.Based on goalie drafting and the Vezina nominations at least Holtby and Quick Bishop had a solid competitive all round game elevated by amazing puck handling on the side it continues to be obvious GMs really do not understand what goalies are doing out there and why what works where.Im praying for Bishop since he handles high event hockey much better and his puck handling means he gets shot at a lot less to begin with and personally creates zone breakouts. Reimer would be great having not only radically improved his game and having a ridiculous high danger Sv but being used to an exciting environment in front of his net except those games never involved his team scoring at the other end of the ice.I just hope Nill can swing it. Possibly find a way to trade Niemi or something. He said hes fine starting the season with both goalies ... but the Habs said they werent trading Subban.People say the Stars need to fix their defense but personally I think the Stars puck moving defense would be fine with a goalie that can aggressively save against high danger shots. Not every goalie can handle firewagon hockey but theres not an inherent problem with playing it.,DallasStars,d4ug7ba,6,t5_2ro4p

8845116,0,t1_d7b19fi,Im sure all three of them would have reason to stay. But there is one massive reason to leave. Money. Not just their money our money. Both Oduya and Sharpie have multiple cups so the likelihood that they would take significant pay cuts and they would be significant compared to the rest of the market is not good.Again I could squint really hard when I look in to the future and see Hemsky staying but its just not likely. Hell have to really really want it to stay here. Hemsky didnt just make  mil a year for the past  years. A few million more a year than were willing to offer is going to mean a lot to him. Oduya was not good. He was OK at best. He had trouble moving the puck under pressure he wasnt quick he chased out of the slot and he was exposed as an undersized Dman when he stayed. He was good at positioning especially on oddman situations and he could block shots. He also doesnt give much going forward. Hes should be a rd pairing on a really good team based on his play last year. To your point hes here because of his experience. And maybe hell be better this year. The fact of the matter is is that hell be too old too expensive and flat out just in the way next year.I like all those guys. I want so much for Hemsky to do well and obviously Sharpie is an absolute killer. I just dont see them sticking around. I honestly dont see Oduya and Hemsky even being offered contracts.,DallasStars,d7b233i,1,t5_2ro4p

That always seemed to jack my ticket price way up and they wouldnt sell. I did fixed or declining. Just use the price guide and go from there. Weekend games sell well in general and typically for over the STH price you paid. Weekday games especially against certain opponents dont sell as well. I would typically sell those at my cost or just below. Dont be afraid to sell value games for slightly less.

I think when he launched the pass he actually put it behind someone in the neutral zone and Faksa was just coming off the bench and found it. Im open to the idea that Im misreading that play. But I dont even think Faksa was fully off the bench when he sent the pass.In any case he was confident with the puck and made some outstanding plays.

10562056,0,t1_dczkeoi,I completely understand that but personally I like the drama. I want my team to be in it. I want a close game because winning in a fight of a game is a whole lot more rewarding than blowing out the opponent and losing in a heartbreaker is more exciting since you had hope rather than just not showing up at all. Its like the emotion involved in a blowout only goes so high if you win and only so low if you lose since theres expectation there early on but you get such a wider range of emotion in close games win or lose. Its more exciting haha,DallasStars,dd5btzl,1,t5_2ro4p

10651370,0,t1_ddelur9,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,DallasStars,ddelutr,3,t5_2ro4p

Were not paying the guy . million to center Janmark and Nichushkin but I guess we are or whoever else they threw out there this year when he was healthy and janmark and Nuke were gone. Hes so much more capable. This season he had  points in  games. Last year he had  in  games played. He could easily be a C anywhere but if we did that to him here then Seguin or Benn would have to go to line  just so we have a balanced lineup and for that reason I understand why he is not but to say hes not a C is IMO wrong.,DallasStars,dg93zq8,5,t5_2ro4p

11616992,0,t1_dgacgz6,I think Im with you if he had a great defense in front of him and a defensive coach like hitch. Kari is extremely talented and Im not sure he has ever had a great defense here in Dallas. ,DallasStars,dgcsofm,1,t5_2ro4p

11804674,0,t1_dgy35vk,Im glad you enjoyed the post.Id say Im in the camp that wants Heiskanen to stay another year in the Liiga because I would like to see him get more growth opportunities as the man on the backend.Another year of running the PP on such a large ice surface gives him the chance to continue developing his visionmobilitypassing in a familiar environment.Hes also going to get lots of PK time so more opportunity to practice stick usage as well as positioning switching onto the open man and how to play the body.In regards to bulking up Im not sure which would be the best path Id assume hes going to get bigger wherever he goes but I would think that as he bulks up his shots will become heavier and more dangerous as well.,DallasStars,dgy3mux,6,t5_2ro4p
