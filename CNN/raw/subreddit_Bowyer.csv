And no not just on the internet your only response was Again for young people. Not adults.Youve explained that when you say young adults you mean kids which despite intent comes across as derogatory so it seems that despite the reality of things you are intent on without a proper rebuttal insulting anyone who holds an opinion on the matter contrary to your own.I dont think the name is superior to any of the suggestions Ive received but your reason is at least two generations too late to convince most people.,Bowyer,cm663k8,4,t5_2rpzn

2961574,0,t1_co4qkb6,Yes. If possible Youd want the grain perfectly straight and running end to end. Some imperfections are ok but I always try and find perfect boards. Sometimes the grain will run off the edge of the board. This is fairly common and although it is not perfect some runoff can be tolerated. If the grain is good you wont need to back it but some backings can help. I believe rawhide is the best from what Ive experienced and seen. Some say linen thread can make a very strong backing but I think other fabric backings are pointless. If you find a board with good grain orientation I wouldnt worry about the back at all. I think that most beginners feel that they have to back their bows to get it to survive and I dont believe thats the case. The backings most beginners use like the drywall tape Ive seen to be pretty much useless. By far the best thing to keep a bow from breaking is good grain orientation good starting dimensions and good tiller. Backings shouldnt make a shooting bow. The bowyer should. ,Bowyer,co4qukh,1,t5_2rpzn

3547514,0,t1_cpwk7pt,uJustinM is right about the extra set but that will vary depending on design and specs.  If it was a little overbuilt  to begin with extra length andor width it might not take any more than it would have.  Or if might.  Dont sweat it this time.  Also because a pyramid bow has such even strain it takes less set inherently than other designs unless you or I mess it up.  Excessive set is to be avoided but some set is ok.,Bowyer,cpwn0t4,2,t5_2rpzn

4201659,0,t3_38yln6,For deer leg sinewDictums website doesnt work properly in english atm they have many useful tools and materials like backstrap sinew which is easier to seperate.I think Martin Fields here made a bow with salmon leather covering a while ago. The finished product is also available here hereIf you buy leg sinew you need to be aware that its finer but alot more work to completely split down and shorter. A wooden hammer and some kind of anvil is needed.You probably already know that you need to glue it up with hideglue so you need to know how the process works etc. Its best to try  or  testruns with little bundles of leftovers so that you get a feeling for how fast the glue gels and how much working time you have when you comb it out on the bow,Bowyer,crz6jf1,2,t5_2rpzn

4809552,0,t3_3gqq1g,Are we talking Dsection warbows? To get that weight with lumber store wood youll probably want a backed bow or laminate. Sort the woods into categories like Backings hickory maple ash white oak. Bellies Osage yew ipe jatoba or other dense exotics. A good white elm or ash can make a fine selfbow just make it wider to handle the weight.,Bowyer,cu0s83p,4,t5_2rpzn
4935464,0,t3_3i1rfc,If you live in the US it is likely not a Chinese elm though lots of folks call them that.  Chinese elms are rare and beautiful trees with multicolored bark streaked leaves and very hard wood.  The types called Chinese elms are generally a red elm of some sort Slippery Russian etc.But it will make a bow.  I am VERY against seasoning white wood trees like elm.  Seasoning has no effect except to dry wood without damaging it.  Elm is very prone to degradation by insects its delicious apparently and fungus love it. I have lost elm to bugs in a clean shed in  months eaten all through with holes.Take the tree down split it up remove bark and rough out your bow to full width but to no more than  thick. Coat the ends with glue and brush a coat of varnish on the limbs and handle.  Then CLAMP or otherwise restrain the wood so it wont warp cup or twist and put it somewhere cool and damp like a cellar or shady creek bottom.   Leave it there a week. Then take it out fearlessly into the sun and wind still clamped to a form or board and itll be dry enough to tiller in two weeks maybe less.Seasoning only really benefits very hard woods that are rot resistant like tropicals and osage and delicate precious woods like yew also rot resistant.   There is no chemical change to wood dried a long time that benefits it.,Bowyer,cugnksp,1,t5_2rpzn

6232616,0,t1_cyxw9y2,I shot a  pvc bow that launched arrows at about  the speed and force of my  holmegaard. Because the energy isnt transferred well to the nontapered limbs the force is wasted into the bow instead of the arrow. Because PVC is so strong it can withstand that shock but it makes for a much less powerful shot despite the same draw weight,Bowyer,cyy2ws8,1,t5_2rpzn
6686744,0,t1_d0axzj2,Fiberglass tape is flexible but doesnt stretch which are good qualities for a backing material. A lot of traditional purist or primitive bowyers consider fiberglass to be a dirty word. In those circles people back bows with more natural materials like flax linen deer sinew or rawhide. All reportedly will get the job done. My first board bow was red oak backed with linen.,Bowyer,d0ayuka,3,t5_2rpzn
6818126,0,t1_d0nks6h,Yeah I agree. Tipgriptip.  Those MUST align.  Also yes the closer the thickness is to the width  the easier it is for the limb to twist.  There is a reason English longbows dont have recurves.  When I make an all wood recurve bow they have wide flat limbs for sure. Partly to take the strain but partly because that lets the limbs ONLY bend in one direction.  If they were round there would be no reason for them to bend how I wanted them to and they would simply bend in whatever direction the leverage was best.,Bowyer,d0p4sn7,2,t5_2rpzn

8707916,0,t3_4yzt8c,Hi fellow Aussie here. In terms of usable timbers here its a bit trickier than overseas. Tassie Oak generally is not that good. Its strong but cannot flex far before breaking. The few people Ive heard of making a tassie oak bow either have it snap immediately or the few cases where it doesnt because they made it wide and long its too heavy so it sends arrows out slowly for its draw weight.The native timbers we do have that work tend to be stiffer and lend themselves to flatbows. If youre after something easier then theres American red oak at Masters so read up on correct wood grain for bows and grab one. They are more expensive though. There are other timbers out here in Aus like all the elm planted over victoria but odds are youll need to cut and season the timber yourself and Im sure you dont want to wait a year for timber to make a bow.Last thing if you want to make a bow thats easy to make and will always have the correct grain but wont necessarily be that fast you can grab a piece of bamboo decking board and get to work.,Bowyer,d6u4icu,1,t5_2rpzn

Take a xx stick and glue a piece of sandpaper on the bottom of one end. On the other carve out a groove to accept your bow handle. Measure  on the stick from the front of the bow then use the stick to push the bathroom scale down as you draw the string toward the scale.

I suppose thats not the end of the world though.The only bows Ive seen that are that short and flex that much and last more than a couple months before taking excessive set are laminated recurves. If you use a nonrecurve design for it itll suffer from absolutely terrible stacking problems. It will probably also take an excessive set.
