374951,0,t3_1ydp9t,The vanguard party is the most theoretically developed section of the proletariat and the goal of the party is to incorporate the entire working mass and the entire discussion of the interests of the working class into the party while educating them on theoretical matters. The theoretical unity is important because the success of the proletariat depends on their following of Marxs method of historical analysis. Of course the conclusions reached by the method may be debated among the proletariat within the party. Also dont believe the lies about Marxism not wanting democracy. It most certainly wants democracy for the proletariat with the proletariat having dictatorial powers over the reactionary classes.,communism101,cfjmnch,12,t5_2uc81
430506,0,t3_1yzezo,The problem is that capitalism has over production this sounds great and maybe would be except it is under a profit system. Why does it over produce? Because it is inherent under capitalism and cannot be prevented the capitalist economy follows the formula of MCM which M represents money invested to create a commodity C and then the profit is M pronounced M prime. So for example we spend  dollars to make a  dollar shirt  for transportation . for wear and tear on machine and  for materials then . for the worker That  represents M then after labor a shirt is created which is C and the profit Shirt price minus cost of making  minus  is a  profit.Because the worker gets paid . that means for every shirt he makes he can only buy one fourth of that same shirt back now when we look at say  workers then can all only buy x amount of all of the products thus not everything can sell because there must be a profit to be made.Because of this over production capitalists do whatever they can to make up for the surplus which cannot sell such as laying off workers and raising prices thus bringing the economy into a recession this is inherent under capitalism and did not even occur once under the soviet union when it happened about  times during the soviet unions existence. Therefor unemployment rises and people get paid less eventually the economy may recover but still it will happen in just a few years.That is the main economic problem of capitalismThe social problem with capitalism is a dialectical social relationship between the proletariat those who produce and the bourgeoisie those who own the means of productions and hire people to produce the problem is not necessarily that the bourgeoisie are evil as evil is always a matter of evil for whom? but that the interests of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are and will always be in opposition even naturally Engels was a factory owner and he had to exploit workers or else he would run out of business. The interests of the proletariat are better working conditions higher wages and etc. The interests of the bourgeoisie are to create profit and lowering wages and worse working conditions generally create profit. Thus we have class conflict it is an antagonistic contradiction which means that it cannot be resolved under the current order of society and there must be a huge revolution in system and social character to solve this. Because of this contradiction in the interests of class Imperialism exists. Imperialism is when a country accumulates capital through the workers of a foreign country E.G. sweat shops in India. They super exploit women men and children and under develop countries as wages will almost never increase nor will living standards to a national extent. Imperialism came about from the workers of developed countries demanding better wages and other things which go against the bourgeois class interest of profit therefore to keep profit factory jobs were placed in India and imperialism developed in the name of profitsee the trend?. Therefore the proletariat of more developed countries live better and are more satisfied with the current economy than the starving proletariat of the underdeveloped countries which is why there is a larger movement there. Because the class interest of the bourgeoisie is profit the environment does not matter as it is profitable to quickly exploit resources even if they damage the earth. It is because of profit that sexism and racism exists as is today a black american female will earn half of what a white male will thus sexism and racism justify paying them less. It is because of profit that people do not have access to the same things they had in the soviet union free healthcare guaranteed work a house to live in free education and etc. Unemployment works as a labor pool and draws people from it so they can get cheaper workers and can lay off workers without fear unemployment does not benefit the proletariat so that is another class contradiction.To summarize the main problems of capitalism is that the economy will no matter what go through bad periods due to surplus and the proletariat will suffer because of it. The other main problem is that the interests of the workers and the bourgeoisie will always differ therefore the proletariat will always be exploited under capitalism. Because of bourgeois interests issues like sexism the environment racism and etc cannot be solved.Edit Forgive the long reply For further reading check out Wage Labour and Capital ,communism101,cfpdxsz,9,t5_2uc81

952096,0,t3_25092d,gtI know this is kind of a beginner question that I should probably already understand.this is communism . we do not fault you for ignorance unless you claim to be an expert.gtI was having this convo with some free marketeers a tough task for any communist unlike the average person they think about politics and economics and have some confidence in their wacky ideasgtwho argued that communism  like capitalism or free market socialism  would ultimately require compulsory labor and an authoritarian ideology of work in order to keep a communist relations.this is in fact a pretty basic anti communist argument. the idea being that the moment we remove the fear of death or imprisonment as a consequence of idleness people will abandon their occupations in droves. since that would theoretically cause the economy to cease functioning obviously we would have to force them back to work.there are a few responses. none of them have the finality and assurance a free market advocate wants. remember they think literally all human problems are solved by the mechanism of competitive pricing.first socialism only occurs when the people realize capitalism is the source of their suffering and rise up in revolt against it. they refuse to pay rent they refuse to give money to shareholders or upper management. if the police or the army are used they defend themselves. but it is only socialism if this process occurs and succeeds. what then prompts these victorious revolutionaries to abandon the fruits of their victory? ok perhaps they dont immediately but become complacent and so the argument goes eventually idleness becomes a major difficulty. except I feel thats a fairly outrageous idea again because people do not enjoy being truly idle. it remains to find a new method of incentive and generally I have faith this can be done without needing to elucidate the exact means. this wont satisfy a free marketeer. second I think we can handle massive amounts of unemployment the amount of work needed to meet basic human needs is much lower than youd imagine. I mention here that some Marxists believe from each according to their ability to each according to their need is a literal prescription and so we can handle this by providing goods to workers only starving the idle. I think this is a simplistic and frankly anti Marxist interpretation but I include it for reasons of completenessfinally maybe we are compelled for reasons of rhetoric to engage with unlikely possibilities so what if  of the work force truly does choose to sit indoors and either scrabble for food or shortly starve to death? I would argue that is their right. one way socialism can be described is finding a way for humanity to make collective decisions. if we decide to perish or cease innovating we have that right. if the free marketeer argues he doesnt think you have the right to stop producing food and clothing for him you can discuss what rights he thinks exist and point out that coercing others even through the indirect tool of capitalism to suffer for his better life is totally contrary to the values he espouses and is in fact wage slavery,communism101,chcif60,9,t5_2uc81

1051216,0,t1_chnaqhp,I think that youve made some pretty good points so far and before attempting to address Zak Copes point Id just like to say that colonialism didnt just plunder resources it redirected labor efforts to making profit for Europe and the USA rather than to improve the local community. This broke agricultural traditions leading to the loss of a lot of local knowledge about farming and other production further slowing the development of the third world. gt Zak Cope even alleged that colonial exploitation from the crusades couldve made the difference for West Europe. Is there any evidence of such a view?I dont know how much the crusades and the wealth gathered from the crusades directly benefited Europe after all Ottoman wars in the Balkans did not result in the same success. However important technologies like the compass the blunting of the Caliphate the creation of even more disorder to South West Asia and the temporary and very tenuous peace it created in parts of Europe were all less direct but very important consequences.,communism101,chns0lt,2,t5_2uc81
1051243,0,t3_2650v9,All states need cohesion in order to exist.  Socialist states and western democracies can not tolerate a deviation from their grander designs.  It follows then that any rebel or cabal that plans a free market revolution in a socialist state would be dealt with accordingly.  Talk of liberalizing the market and establishing class distinctions would be a crime.  The same can be said about western democracies.  You can say you are a socialist you can say what ever you want in theory but you can not embody your words.  You can not live by your words in western democracy unless it conforms to liberal expressions.  Workers cant just take over the coffee shop and exile the owner without being arrested imprisoned and likely charged with terrorism.  Both societies define crimes in their own way.  Its tit for tat really.  A bourgeois person can not express or be themselves in a socialist state.  If they tried it would be a crime.

Marx based his ideas on the philosophy of dialectical materialism which precludes a God or a universal morality. He also famously referred to religion as the opiate of the people. Lenin was almost definitely not influenced by the bible as he simply made practical and theoretical advancements to the Marxist framework. Imperialism expanded Marxs economic theories to their contemporary development for example and he also wrote extensively about Marxs philosophy Materialism and EmpirioCriticism. Lenin does draw some principles from the Bible  He who does not work shall not eat though likely to popularise his ideas rather than merely by their virtue of being the Holy Book.Hope this helps hth.,communism101,cjx9la7,10,t5_2uc81

2115856,0,t3_2j4wfe,One state cannot be  this or  that especially with socialism. Secondly the working class has an organ of democracy within the government therefore there is no ownersship by a capitalist class. There is also workplace democracy if a workplace has a manager he or she would likely be elected and subject to recall. I like to think of socialism as saying all right we have democracy in the government which I disagree that in the US we do but for simplicity just pretend we do now lets have some in the workplace. So we have workplace democracy. This is a major goal of Marx. But it is not the end goal basically during the industrial revolution there were anti state and pro state ideologies. Marx saw the abolishion of the state as wonderful but saw anarchist attempts to go from massive capitalist state to no state utopian and impossible. He said we must transition to that anarchy. Socialist revolution takes place and as time goes on things become pointless why do we need  different kinds of toothpaste? we get one. If we are all under peaceful socialist governments is an army necessary? As socialism progresses things like marriage are just social acts and there is no reason for the state to do anything. The use of money becomes pointless therefore there are no taxes. As you can see the state withers away. But what remains would take form of what Engels called an administration. Once the state has decayed or withered away socialism is then referred to as Communism thus a socialist state can exist but not a communist state.  Rather than an economy living off of something as unstable as profit which profit is the interest of the one percent the interest of the workers is to have the highest living standard and best working conditions possible things would be planned with the goal to be satisfying the needs then wants of the people. Overproduction would be drastically decreased the government also could focus on being green earth saving things are either profitable because they attract a certain customer or they are unprofitable because its cheaper to do x If technology rids the needs of jobs then unemployment would be met by everyone working a little less and filling in the gaps. This administration would be as what zizoviev a russian revolution defined as the highest form of democracy. This administration would in fact exist while the socialist state existed it would be the one thing in the socialist system that did not end. Communism wouldnt be the end all other systems could grow due to advancements in technology. It also may develop new parties. A problem of communism is the question of who gets the house on the hill each party or organization may handle it differently. For instance there may be someone who advocates a meritocracy to determine who gets whats scarce another party may advocate each person gets equal amount of points and can pick and choose which scarce things they would like. By providing for everyones needs according to a psychologist  that i have seen fascists capitalists and communists agree with his idea so it is legit Abraham Maslow there would be more Beethoven or Di Vincis.

2410823,0,t3_2n0s6l,The state can wither away only after it has proved to be unnecessary and useless. This is done through the elimination of classbased society. IN capitalist society the state is used as an instrument to oppress the working class and consolidate the power of the bourgeoisie.  In socialist society the working class uses the state as an instrument to oppress the reactionaries and the remains of the capitalist order. Therefore when world revolution is achieved and the workers have adapted to a proper full socialist way of life when there is nothing to be protected against then the state would prove to be useless. It would slowly wither away especially as administration becomes more decentralized. ,communism101,cm9oqcz,2,t5_2uc81

2549941,0,t3_2owtua,Id say in the same way that we do a lot of stuff just because because its in our culture most communists expect that culture will grow until it governs most of our behavior. So a lot of what today is considered law would be useless in a classless society and people would just do the right thing. Lenin talks specifically about this in State and Revolution when he explores what it means exactly that the State withers away for what is worth.That being said I suppose its inevitable that some people would do strange things or that youll find emergencies and unexpected situations so I guess well live with some kind of code of law rarely used and people able to implement it during emergencies for a long time in communism perhaps it wont be TRUE communism until even such a thing also withers away? Who knows sounds like pointless semantics at this point. How this will work exactly is hard to say but maybe see Special Circumstances in the Culture series or something like that heh? The only important nuance would be in my opinion that those people would not be special bodies of armed men and would definitely not exist to serve the interest of a given class. So think of an amateur militia trained for emergencies.Also answering a question you made in the thread down below and connected with this yes definitely Marxists are moral relativists in the sense that we view morality as a historical construction subject to change,communism101,cmrext2,1,t5_2uc81

2673534,0,t1_cn7iyhu,ushanksarmitage addresses this a little in their answer as well but my understanding of the reasoning has to do with various classes relations to production. Peasants often owned a little land and engaged in smallscale individual production. Since petty property in land worked by individual peasant families is the foundation of the peasants material existence their class interest will tend to balk at the total destruction of private property and the socialization of production. Thus for Marx the peasantry while having an obvious material interest in the abolition of relations of exploitation also tends towards a certain conservative attitude which reactionaries can and will seize on for their own conservation. For Marx the organized social action of proletarians who own nothing except for their bodies and live only by the sale of their laborpower is a force which can really challenge the institutional foundation of capitalism which is to say private property because the workers have no personal stake in preserving private property they have none.While I think this is a somewhat abstract and formalistic understanding of class relations in the United States there are large strata of waged workers who are also petty propertyowners and in much of the world there are large strata of peasants who are themselves dispossessed it is important to consider concretely the relation of particular classes to the means of production and what this may mean for their interests in abolishing the foundations of capitalist exploitation.It is important also to emphasize that in the course of revolutionary strategizing this has not necessarily translated to a stance antagonistic to peasant interests. Lenin repeatedly emphasized the fundamental importance of the workers cementing a class alliance with the peasantry which would lead peasants into socialistcommunist production collaboratively and voluntarily and in China of course the CPC openly relied on the strength of the peasantry to fight the Japanese and Kuomintang and build socialism. Lenin also emphasized that the actual state the Bolsheviks had established was not a workers state but rather a workers and peasants state with a distinct bureaucratictechnical twist. IE the goal was to build towards socialism but they were not starting from a pure capitalist mode of production with only the distinctive classes of capitalist production present but from a society which had multiple kinds of production present and with multiple oppressed and exploited classes and whose revolution could only emerge on the basis of a democratic revolution of all the oppressed and exploited classes  including the peasantry. ,communism101,cn7jxe7,2,t5_2uc81

2684613,0,t1_cn8ssnt,For individual leftliberals I would say that if they seem deeply politically motivated to end all injustice they may be able to be educated into becoming socialists. If they seem instead to have defaulted to an unexamined vague leftliberal stance but are mostly apolitical they are probably not worth your effort.For institutions dont even bother. They have very strong financial incentives to appear to be a left alternative to the mainstream but to ultimately reinforce capitalismfor instance the Democratic Party especially its Congressional Progressive Caucus. Their masters are the especially clever bourgeoisie the Rockefellers and such who understand that you can toss some crumbs and sell the image without ever providing the substance and in that way dissipate most of the potential radical dissent from ever reaching that point.Truthfully we should be good marxists and understand that socialist revolutions happen not because of idealism just spread the idea of socialism and because it makes so much sense it will catch but through materialism make a scientific analysis of class structure and let that be your guide about how to operate. This is the reason we focus on the working classbecause they have nothing to lose but their chains. However there are very good arguments that almost no true working class exists in the Global North because populations here benefit so much from exploiting the Third World. For this reason the closest thing to a proletariat here consists of people who are nationally racially oppressed who are workingclass or imprisoned undocumented migrant workers people who are poor and trans and especially trans women and poor single mothers. Think of how the Black Panther Party operated They went into very oppressed communities and became a force to solve those peoples problems so those communities in turn supported and upheld the BPP. And the BPP grew very quickly because of this. This is how the Bolshevik Party operated and also how the Chinese Communist Party operated. It is in short how successful communist parties actually operate.If youre not a member of one of those classes of people who constitute the real proletariat here the best thing you can do is find the most radical leftist organization nearby that is currently working to empower people in these classes and struggle alongside them in whatever way you can not trying to lead just to fight alongside while not being afraid to speak your socialist political understanding openly and respectfully when the opportunities present themselves naturallywhile also organizing other people not in these classes to do the same.

First of all you present it as an eitheror fallacy there is a good reason or theyre just goofing off and you take for granted that every worker who has a reason for starting a union has a valid reason for it. Im not saying that youre wrong but that this argument has a severe flaw. If you can show persistent failings by the USSR to adequately address workers rights then I will be more convinced of the need for unions to protect workers from the state.Im not saying we should get rid of independent unions. I think independent union is an important organization against reactionaries and capitalist reforms. I dont think however that the socialists states failed to protect workers rights to the point that unions were necessary to address those failings. ,communism101,cnb617j,1,t5_2uc81

There is a clear antagonism between nationalities within Syria and Iraq especially with regards to the Kurds. Due to the government policies of Syria Kurds have been separated into three geographically noncontiguous pockets of land on the border of Northern Syria. The most notable example of Arab socialist mistreatment of Kurds was in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. For this reason I do not really consider Arab socialism to be much of an improvement and I dont really think that if there was any shred of socialist ideology to begin with that the Syrian government is following it currently.,communism101,cnl0g0f,5,t5_2uc81

4761685,0,t3_3g2aci,I have similar mixed feelings on guns. As a practical matter U.S. gun policy is obviously insane and a more effective and comprehensive background check system is a nobrainer. As a Marxist ideologue Im sympathetic to the Cuban model of arming and training the entire populace in place of having a large standing army. Every able bodied adult Cuban is armed and has some basic training in firearm usage and guerrilla tactics. OTOH the same approach would not be particularly useful in the U.S. based on current geopolitical conditions. A ground invasion of the continental U.S. is not a serious threat and to the extent that we would want a Communist US to maintain the capacity to project hard power internationally a public militia wont be much help compared to a professional military with the kind of hardware we clearly dont want on our streets. And in terms of the need for weapons to wage violent revolution if and when the time comes... Realistically the U.S. Military is not gonna be defeated by armed citizens the revolution will mostly live or die based on how much of the military defects to fight with the people and how much of Uncle Sams firepower they can take with them. Plus even if the state started targeting political groups and denying them legal access to guns which hardly seems plausible politically speaking although red baiting has long been an exception to western democracies insistence that they dont ban or discriminate against political minorities I doubt that would be much of an impediment to any revolutionary organization with anywhere near the popular support and logistical competence that would be required to wage a successful revolution in the worlds sole remaining military superpower. I also think a communist society would probably choose to put some common sense restrictions on tools designed for killing human beings to keep them out of the hands of the mentally ill and unstable children violent criminals etc. I dont think thats inconsistent with believing that people have a right to self defense or even that widespread gun ownership is a good thing because it maintains the revolutionary potential of the masses. Its also worth mentioning that theres more to gun violence in America than the physical presence of lots of guns. Canada has even higher per capita rates of gun ownership but dramatically lower rates of gun violence. Violent crime is first and foremost a symptom of poverty and inequality  people forced by society into desperate situations denied access to mental health care and not presented with better legitimate options will turn to violent crime in far greater numbers than people with access to better social and economic opportunities. There will probably always be the occasional psychopath in any society and keeping guns out of their hands sounds like a pretty good idea to me but i think the prevalence of violent crime in America is largely the result of our extreme wealth inequality. The prevalence of guns just exacerbates that underlying issue by making each instance of violent crime much more likely to be lethal.,communism101,ctur6jk,2,t5_2uc81

Lately repeated reference has been made to my share in this theory and so I can hardly avoid saying a few words here to settle this point. I cannot deny that both before and during my  years collaboration with Marx I had a certain independent share in laying the foundation of the theory and more particularly in its elaboration. But the greater part of its leading basic principles especially in the realm of economics and history and above all their final trenchant formulation belong to Marx. What I contributed  at any rate with the exception of my work in a few special fields  Marx could very well have done without me. What Marx accomplished I would not have achieved. Marx stood higher saw further and took a wider and quicker view than all the rest of us. Marx was a genius we others were at best talented.

The inclusion of those two groups is something Id like to understand better myself. What I can tell you from my current understanding is for instance for doctors they make so much money that they almost inevitably start making investments in the stock market and in real estate that tie their livelihoods to the success of capitalism. They also have a position of prestige and respect that gives them way more cultural capital than virtually all other workers. They also almost always become small business owners employing several support staff.Teachers is trickier for me to explain but I do get ita large section of them have stable positions and decent benefits.

6022538,0,t1_cy8kko6,Now youre just making no sense. You began by claiming your claim that RI isnt pro revolution was justified because RI has no strategy for revolution. In the next breath you say RI is blanquist... but the thing that defines blanquism is a particular shitty revolutionary strategy. This is not principled criticism its just throwing a wall of inconsistent bullshit up hoping something sticks because you want to dismiss any organization that isnt the PCR.  Perhaps by blanquist you simply mean RI is too secretive  doesnt expose itself to the masses enough. This could be made into a principled criticism and one I would be interested in but so far you havent come close. Blanquism though is just a stupid accusation and one aimed at preventing criical thought and principled struggle. RIs documents on their public website discuss the importance of mass movement building a hell of a lot. Maybe they suck at accomplishing that but theyre clearly engaged in a practice of trying to organize and mobilize the masses for revolution. To be clear Im not in RI and cannot represent them but I know a couple of RI members who I met through work at a non revolutionary level and who acknowledged their membership when I asked. There could be an interesting discussion around public vs underground organization but youre doing everything you can to prevent it.On the question of revolutionary strategy it is my interpretation as an outsider that RI has not declared itself as a party largely for that reasonthey have a sober assessment of where theyre at and are not yet at a level of being a revolutionary party. They are clearly communists who are trying to figure out what a revolutionary road is in Canada. There have been no advanced revolutionary struggles in advanced imperialist countries comparable to Canada so that seems reasonable to me.

6327202,0,t3_429mv4,As Mao said in On Contradictiongt According to materialist dialectics changes in nature are due chiefly to the development of the internal contradictions in nature. Changes in society are due chiefly to the development of the internal contradictions in society that is the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production the contradiction between classes and the contradiction between the old and the new it is the development of these contradictions that pushes society forward and gives the impetus for the supersession of the old society by the new. Does materialist dialectics exclude external causes? Not at all. It holds that external causes are the condition of change and internal causes are the basis of change and that external causes become operative through internal causes.

The law of value for example is usually considered specific to capitalism there is some debate about whether this law holds in simple commodity production or during the transition to communism. In a famous letter Marx also speaks of a law of proportionate distribution of social labor which is common to all modes of production. In fact in that latter he says that the law of value is simply the form that the law of  proportionate distribution of social labor takes under the capitalist mode of production.,communism101,czt6uct,2,t5_2uc81

6526319,0,t1_czu1l1o,Thanks for the reply. With regards to the second problem there is this passage later in the chapter which maybe clears things up.gtWe thus see that the absence of proportion between the value of the sum and the number of added units is as far as presentday economic conditions are concerned a pure fiction. It is so emphatically in contradiction with reality that BhmBawerk himself is unable to pursue his own point of view to a logical conclusion Referring to the great number of indirect evaluations he states But if we are capable of judging that an apple has for us precisely the value of eight plums while a pear has precisely the value of six plums we are also capable of judging after making a conclusion from these two premises as our third judgment that an apple is precisely onethird more valuable to us than a pear. Ibid. p. BhmBawerk is discussing subjective evaluations. This observation is essentially quite correct but it is not a correct application of BhmBawerks point of view. For how do we arrive in this case at the third judgment that an apple is onethird dearer than a pear? Merely because eight plums are evidently onethird more than six plums. We are here presupposing a proportion to exist between the value of the sum and the number of units the value of eight plums can only be onethird greater than the value of six plums if the value of eight plums is eight times the value of one plum and the value of six plums six times the value of one plum. This example again shows us how slight is the agreement between BhmBawerks theory and the economic phenomena of reality. His presentation is perhaps acceptable as an explanation of the psychology of the wanderer in the desert the colonist the man sitting by the spring and in these cases only insofar as these individuals have no opportunity to produce. In a modern economy motives like those postulated by BhmBawerk are psychologically impossible and absurd.So maybe that ties into...gtMaybe he is saying that the value of a bundle of a good cannot correspond in reality directly to its marginal utility for each individual good of this bundle would have a different value.I think or did think that is what he is saying. But I didnt see that as a problem. The value of each good changes as what is happening on the margin changes. But given the above paradox I can now see how that doesnt really work.But is that what BohmBawerk thinks? Dont all the individual goods of the bundle actually have all the same value? That of the marginal unit? Also Im actually part of that facebook group on the recommendation of craneomotor. Im just a little apprehensive about posting something that doesnt specifically relate to Neue MarxLektre.Thanks!EDIT Now its seeming more and more that Bukharins point does miss the mark. I dont think BohmBawerk or the marginalist camp think that any individual goods value is determined by its location in relation to the margins but that each individual good assumes the marginal value. So then Bukharins accusation that the total value of the units according to BhmBawerk is not at all equivalent to the value of a single unit multiplied by the number of units. In the case of series       the value of these six units the value of the entire supply is equivalent to           . is incorrect. The value of each is uniform and so the value of the bundle is equal to that marginal value multiplied by the number of goods in the bundle. With this Bukharins argument about the plums and pears and apples collapses.How does this sound to you?,communism101,czudgeo,1,t5_2uc81

6813195,0,t1_d0obxms,On top of the source the other guy posted and there are plenty of others honestly its pretty much an established truism at this point you can look at common sense knowledge. Men are consistently larger than women across all cultures and in fact across most species. For instance a male german shepard is usually around  lbs heavier than its female counterpart and a few inches larger Google it if you dont believe me I promise youll find more than Times of India articles. You cant chalk such a systematic diference up to diet and societal factors.One of the problems with problems with commitment to any type of ideology and this isnt by any means exclusive to Marxism is losing sight of the pursuit of truth for the sake of idelogical consistency. The idea that the sexes are physically equal seems to falls in line with the noble Marxist ideal of equality but it doesnt fit with the reality that we observe. In fact I would argue that when put up to examination it actually turns out to be an unMarxist idea since Marx based his theories on what he observed from history rather than from some abstract idealism not grounded in reality. In a perfect world total equality between the sexes both mentally and physically is of course the ideal but Marxism doesnt deal with the ideal world it deals with ours.If you commit to a theory that anyone can observe to be false from common sense principles you are actually hurting the Marxist cause since you make yourself less credible. The common lie about communism drilled into the heads of school children in capitalist societies by their parents and teachers is that building a truly communistic society is unrealistic and it assumes an ideal world that can never be. So when you espouce unrealistic pseudoscience for the sake of extending ideology to the sciences you play into bourgeoisie hands. ,communism101,d0okmuq,2,t5_2uc81

6880065,0,t3_49z3ge,Well hey in case OP revisits this thread I just wanted to throw out that you arent the first to suggest this idea by any means that the transition from socialism to capitalism in the old USSR led to many deaths because of the flaws of socialism not because of the reintroduction of capitalism its just that Ive literally never heard this idea backed by specific historical arguments. Its always just presented as an article of faith that it was obviously a problem with Sovietstyle socialism rather than the reintroduction of capitalism. Minus specific historical arguments I cant take this idea any more seriously than a religious dogma.Like the claim that the deaths involved in the transition out of socialism is capitalisms fault is rooted in things like the fact that as planned hunger and want were systematically reintroduced to society as part of the reintroduction of capitalism. IE the public housing system was demolished and replaced with landlordism. Whereas before under the USSR you could be broke and unemployed and not have to worry about getting evicted or even really worry about finding work as the government was always willing to find something for you to do the reintroduction of landlordism led to the reappearance of homelessness on a large scale. Same with medicine employment etc etc etc. The Soviet economy was by no means well or healthy by the end of the s but its priorities were set up to minimize basic material want and the contrast has left a lasting impression on many people who lived through these transitions. Go look up polling data on how people in the area of the old Soviet bloc feel about capitalism versus socialism. You might be surprised.For example here is a halfhour long interview with Gspr Tams a former liberal dissident intellectual from Hungary. In this interview he expresses openly his regret for having opposed the Soviet socialist system in favor of capitalism even as moribund as the USSR was by the s and he explains what many peoples hopes were at the time for something more closely resembling what they thought of as communism not market capitalism ,communism101,d0w64ze,1,t5_2uc81

7146888,0,t3_4depb5,I guess a good way to look at it is in light of the kind of relationship a communist society has with global capitalism  or rather whether it was communist or not would totally depend on this relationship. Somewhere in Capital volume  I think Marx describes how exchange springs up at the edge of communities  and this is essential to capitalist valorisation since domestic valuesystems tend to stagnate until surplusvalue withers away lol withering away. And if you think of the logic of imperialism this means there can be no peace under capitalism without foreign exchange. But a communist society cant exchange with anyone since that would entail production for profit even a loss is a negative profit and even articles of domestic consumption would become commodities with values since they can be exchanged. This wouldnt seem all that important if we imagine that these values are distributed fairly but the problem is that word distribution distributive things like fairness and justice as Marx says in the Critique of the Gotha Programme spring out of an economic relation where labour is alienated as value  so it can never be communist. The whole task of that movement then is abolishing capital where it still exists. I guess the way to look at it is in light of that remark from the German Ideology we call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. A society always only exists by producing and reproducing itself its a way we do things. In the case of communism alongside capitalism this would have an international geographically expansive character since borders would still exist. So yeah communism without capital organised as a political force would have to be simply the movement which tries to collectively fulfil needs and unshackle people from regularised valorised labour  making our lives better rather than taking control of them  as you put it communism simply existing or maybe making communism exist. Critique of the Gotha Programme is the classic text for what communism would look like even if its enormously vague. The first book of the German Ideology has some insightful stuff to say about it too if you read it closely and to be honest it might be worth delving into some of the utopians!  William Morris stands out if youre trying to get an idea of what a society without the valueform might look like. Theres also writing that points in that direction in some work geared more toward aesthetics even if it takes a lot of critical deciphering people like Jacques Ranciere and Kristin Ross.

8221609,0,t3_4ryptc,I think I can answer your first question but Im still learning so I hope someone will correct me if I get something wrong.The kind of communism we want hasnt ever been achieved no. Even the communist states that existed in the th century believed this because communism is a classless stateless moneyless society in which the means of production are owned by the whole people. Most of the users here are Leninists that believe the USSR and China were socialist Leninists define socialism as the transitional stage between capitalism and communism for a period of time. Some MarxistLeninists believe China is still socialist even after the liberalization of Chinas economy in the late s but Im of the opinion that thats bullshit and China is like the closest example to the anarchist bogeyman of red fascism there is.According to Marxists the first mode of production was primitive as in prime or first communism. Think of the huntergatherer societies from thousands of years ago. The means of production were owned communally there was no state and no money but the means of production were not developed enough to eliminate scarcity so sometimes tribes would wage war against each other for resources and stuff.Capitalism has allowed the advancement of the means of production to the point that we can provide necessities for everyone on the planet but the existence of private property and the commodification of labor prevents us from doing that. Once FULL COMMUNISM is achieved things like the army and police private ownership of productive property classes and money which all socalled communist states had wont exist. ,communism101,d559a45,3,t5_2uc81

8992686,0,t1_d7sqok9,It drives me crazy. I see this all the time especially online. But you cant force someone to see truth. Many people would prefer to maintain their worldviews however fragile or delicately hinged they are. It makes sense because having to come to terms with a subjective reality that doesnt match up with objective reality is hard. You have to rebuild everything you believe from the ground up. This is just some broad conjecture on my end but I think that the reason people who ardently study philosophy tend to be more leftist is because theyre used to this restructuring of their beliefs based on new information or perspectives. Not to say that there arent philosophers on the right side of the spectrum but you know what Im getting at. Also keeping in mind that people who the system has worked for dont see a problem with the system. Theres a cognitive bias called Survivorship Bias which basically says that people who made it on whatever endeavour misinterpret what it took for them to get where they are and are dismissive of or look down on others who didnt make it. I experience this with a friend of mine. Hes younger than I am  just graduated from college with a business degree. He is a typical conservative and makes it known at all times that he worked hard for his education and for his position that hes about to start working at. I asked him How did you get this position? He replies The CEO of the company was an old classmate of my dads so I interviewed with him and got the position. This of course is obvious to me that his family has influence and money and thats why he got the position. I told him Dont you think then that it wasnt your hard work that got you your job but rather knowing people because you come from a family of affluence? Of course he denies it and says that his interview was perfect he prepared and practiced for it he knew his stuff. While all this is true he wouldnt have even had that opportunity without having the socioeconomic status he did. When I brought this up he walked off in a puff saying something along the lines of How can you be this stupid? I cant put up with this. So yeah I deal with this a lot.

9057569,0,t1_d80ka57,Thank you for your kind words.gt what would it matter to the masses if even only one small marginalized group of people were either excluded or further oppressedIt should be understood that even though the oppression of queer people continued under the Soviet government it was still an improvement for queer and what we would call trans nowadays workingclass people as workers. We can understand it historically as being no better or worse than other places at the time but of course thats no excuse and there is no justifying it. All of that is to say that I dont think theres any grounds for claiming that some previously oppressed group became more deeply oppressed there or in any other leftist revolution.So we can and must be deeply critical of their failure to stop oppression there but it should also be said that that fact offers no support for the original thesis that they were trying to push what if the leftist revolutionary magically becomes an unstoppable fascist dictator somehow someway.It should also be said that all the most successful revolutionary movements in the world nowadays support LGBT liberationso we as a global movement have all learned and grown from and will not repeat that deep failure.,communism101,d80kp4u,5,t5_2uc81

At the same time I know theres a lot in my experience most of them of janitors and plumbers who love what they do they just hate being poorly paid for their labor and being treated as lesser humans.The astronaut question is a bit silly though I know its just an example. First of all you just dont become an astronaut because you want to you still need to do all the studying and training they would do under capitalism so in a single community I doub theres  people ready to be astronauts. Second if somebody is prepared to be an austronaut but for some reason cant be one he can do other things in the meantime the idea that people just dedicate themselves to one single and specific thing their whole lives is entrenched within capitalism but in a communist society it wouldnt or shouldnt be like that. Third if there was any situation of there being more people prepared than the amount that is needed the workers themselves in this case the astronauts and other members of the aerospace team should decide what do so they themselves would have the final say on who will go and who wont based on experience motivation or whatever they see fit or they can decide to pospone the mission until theres enough room for everybody because after all I doubt space missions will ever become something indispensable for humanity.,communism101,d96o1ed,4,t5_2uc81

There are real human beings who do all that stuff. Not everyone can do that and thats ok. Thats what a vanguard really is all the theoretical justification comes after. Go do that stuff. Find the organizations at your local protest that impress you with their competence their commitment and their theoretical understanding of the current situation the local and national problems not just hw many Marx books they can quote. Join those organizations. pettybourgeois liberals think you have to agree with everything a party believes before you join them but in reality your beliefs will change through real political action. Of course some questions are different like imperialism and socialism but thats because they reflect a larger worldview on local questions and strategy rather than being themselves decisive. What a party thinks about the cultural revolution is not in itself important it is what that means about its understanding of orientalism the possibilities of reforming capitalism the tactical and strategic tradition it wants to continue from the new left period when those were contemporary problems and how well its democratic structure functions in relation to party education and deciding a line. The point is to get out there and then decide what questions are decisive for you since praxis is the key to all philosophy. e this does not apply universally this is a tactical necessity of the American left in the st century. the ideological strength and rigidity of the KKE is acceptable in Greece because they have a real presence in the working class and are not in the imperialist metropole. but KKE tactics do not work in America where there is no continuity between the CPUSA in the s and any party today.,communism101,d9ukn8f,2,t5_2uc81

10493251,0,t1_dcwrovj,Hello I am getting a PhD in this area and there are a few reasons this wont work.  There is no way a linear inputoutput model is accurate for a system of this complexity. You will need a fully nonlinear state space model and many of the variables will be discrete. You are actually talking about solving the biggest mixed integer nonlinear program ever formulated. You get one of the Millennium prizes if you can do it in a reasonable amount of time so good luck. It is also completely unclear what your objective function should be.  It is impossible to formulate the problem either way due to the Misean calculation problem. I see elsewhere that you disagree so tell me how do you actually get a socially agreed upon rate of capital accumulation? You need a lot more info to formulate the problem than that though. Even if you have that you only have total capital accumulation and that doesnt tell you WHAT capital should actually be accumulated. You need to solve some sort of capital optimization problem before you can even formulate this problem. Mostly you are going to need a serious justification for why total capital accumulation should be fixed and not a decision variable.  Even if you could formulate the problem it would be impossible to solve fast enough. Problems of much smaller scale take weeks to solve. The uncertain nature of the problem would necessitate that the optimization problem is solved in a moving horizon framework. You would probably need some sort of fast updates for MINLPs and that will definitely net you a PhD if you can figure it out.    ,communism101,dcxiqf8,2,t5_2uc81

Under the final form of Communism people would be working less in the manual labour fields and more to the academic areas or perhaps the arts.Those who are unable to work will still receive according to their need as they deserve it just as much as others.Youll find not many here will call Communism a Utopia.

10747269,0,t3_5tr2uz,Equality and freedom exist in a relationship they are dependent on each other and are both required for true liberation from toil oppression and exploitation to be realized. Freedom means the ability to express yourself creatively in whatever way you so choose provided youre not preventing another from doing the same socialists view any institution that inhibits or prohibits this expression of creativity to be unjust and should be dismantled. Equality doesnt mean everyone has the same stuff or gets paid the same when socialists speak of equality were talking about an equality of power relations. The most recognizable expression of unequal power relations in capitalist society is the employeremployee relationship. The employer dictates what is made where its made under what conditions and command the profits generated through the labor of his employees and pays them a wage just sufficient enough to keep them coming back to work. The worker must spend a sizable portion of their time renting out their labor to an employer to get the money to gain access to the resources necessary to reproduce their existence housing food and water healthcare and education. The worker bakes a loaf of bread to get the money to buy a slice. So for freedom to be realized by the mass of people all relationships whether in public or in private must be in free associations of equal power relations. This means gaining access to the resources we all rely on to reproduce our existence must be decoupled from this employeremployee relationship and more should be guaranteed to all people simply because they exist. ,communism101,ddohz0v,3,t5_2uc81

In writing this I was trying to present the differences and subtleties between the two in as concise a way as possible in plain speech without being so dense it discourages newcomers while also leaving room open for followup questions.

11080795,0,t1_denvei8,I see liberal feminism as a flawed idealism. In my experience many progressive liberals are idealistic in their outlook they fail to recognise the class contradictions inherent to the capitalist mode of production but do genuinely want to see a more equal society.gtLiberal feminism favours the oppression of poor and black women and is content to carry out imperial international relations.OPs question is about patriarchy not any kind of slavery. Patriarchy can be viewed as a system of class division based on sex. Capitalism is a system of class division based on ownership of the means of production. In a purely capitalist society it stands to reason that sex would not be the determining factor in class divide. Oppression of black people is mostly a hangover from colonialism and the fact that blacks are generally born into poverty more often than any other racial group. Given that capital is the cornerstone of capitalism not sex or race I would argue that capitalism has no direct link to racism or sexism it is just a combination of dynastic effects favouring whites and traditions in patriarchal societies which introduce these factors.TLDR Capitalism is about capital patriarchy and sexism are not. Capitalism is bad but patriarchy and racism are worse which is why you can get liberals who are antiracism and antipatriarchy.Feel free to disagree or refute me if I have made any bad arguments.,communism101,denzy1f,0,t5_2uc81

About a further  thousand were allowed to leave in conjunction with ransom payments made by West Germany during these years.

11472676,0,t3_63qorr,Many artists historically have been communists such as Picasso or Frida Kahlo. Trust me there are tons more but this isnt a list. Anyway most communists actually believe that with the necessities of life being available and not under threat of being taken away artists will actually thrive.Think about it this way why are there so many artist stereotypes claiming artists are poor and wont make any money? Because its true in a capitalist society you arent guaranteed a chance to survive and pursue artistic passions without somehow also earning an income that you can survive on. With basic survival needs such as housing food and clothes being met in a communist society one can pursue artistic passions with all their available time rather than spending it working a menial job just to scrape by.In regards to whether or not artistic mediums will be produced in a communist society. Yes they would because there is a cultural need for it. Humans produce culture culture is humanity and in a socialist society culture for culturesake is greatly valued rather than culture for profit.Also check this picture out art under capitalism vs. art under socialism,communism101,dfwf84l,11,t5_2uc81

11504640,0,t1_dfzxyej,Well Cuba has the largest medical school in the world their main export is doctors and education is free and doctors earn on average  a month. So actually I think if you change the society and change peoples way of thinking theyll keep becoming doctors and wont be forced to treat it as a strict costsbenefits equation where the only reason to put in the work and to take on the financial risks of med student debt to become a doctor is to make bank.Ive had doctors who were clearly there simply as a form of wellpaid work. They did their job but quickly and perfunctorily and sloppily. It wasnt important to them. Ive also had doctors who are there because they care about human health. They also did their job quickly but more thoroughly and provided better care. That was their reason for being there.Your question is posed in a purely abstract way. Under capitalism I do not see that happening in any kind of meaningful way. Under a planned socialist economy that can easily be done and should be done through the state planning apparatus but with feedback from assemblies of working people to try to moderate the differences between skilledunskilled labor and manualintellectual labor that a state planning bureaucrat might be biased to exacerbate i think there should be gradations of pay under socialism but nothing remotely like what we have now.,communism101,dg01v2a,3,t5_2uc81

I believe that that is a serious problem and that the world would be better without those owners stealing from the working class and instead the farms factories and so on should be used for the benefit of everyone.This is obviously a bit of an oversimplification but people dont like it when you toss advanced jargon in their face so I think something along those lines would work.,communism101,dgt310q,48,t5_2uc81
