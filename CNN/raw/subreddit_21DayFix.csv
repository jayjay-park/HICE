Make sure you drink all your water  your body weight in oz.  Im with you I never joined my coaches challenge groups its not for everyone and now Im the one hosting them lol.  Come up with a plan on how you are going to hold yourself accountable for the  weeks regarding food amp exercise. ,21DayFix,d1chcmr,2,t5_305ny
