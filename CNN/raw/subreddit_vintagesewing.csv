1107749,0,t1_chu7ge3,Oh gosh you should have no problem offloading old machines anywhere in the US even if they arent pretty!  Kijiji does have a presence in the US and Craigslist might work as well though I tend to gravitate towards kijiji.,vintagesewing,chu7iqs,1,t5_315b8
5481492,0,t1_cw3xh3a,I finally got an answer back. The tech did retime it to use x needles. They replaced the bobbin case but it looks like that was for just a standard  case. The shop said they could set it back to factory standard for use with the  needles for free since they didnt check with me first. I guess that would be the way to go then buy one of the modified bobbin cases? Im really not sure since the tension seems to be just fine with the retiming. ,vintagesewing,cwcb8ox,1,t5_315b8
