29461,0,t1_cehl6nz,Pay to win is at best bad game design at worst a little bit evil.So no its not pay to win in the slightest. You cant buy items at all and the clothing items are purely cosmetic. If you take a look at the screenshot from the landing page youll see there are a range of costume slots. If you equip some clothing youve bought itll go into those slots and that will be displayed instead of the regular clothing but its the armour values on the regular clothing that are used.Honestly though developers employ pay to win because sadly it works. They roll around in the money and it makes them feel better about the bad game design theyve done.

69324,1,t1_cembdzt,It wasnt trolling griefing and abuse maybe. But it was against an enemy not just a player. Big distinction.The game is based on conflict drama politics and war like a microcosm of real world politics just exagerrated.Youre talking about people who have been PvPing fighting and arguing on forums with each other every single day for months on end it builds a real and emotional rivalry sometimes out of respect and sometimes out of hatred.Enemy guilds spend all day long hunting each other down in the open world there are no instances and trying to block and prevent their enemies from progressing through content that would give them an advantage. This is the nature of the game and its what everybody signs up for and enjoys or they wouldnt be playing even if sometimes it doesnt always go your way the times it does go your way just make it that more exciting because there is a real winloss not just made up points like a themepark game with arenas or instances that mean nothing. And they were against real enemies that were created through interactions in the game not just random RvR kill someone because they chose a different faction on character creation.There have been some murders over Lineage  enemy guilds have actually met in parking lots and had street brawls with each other It was a crazy game but obviously these are the most extreme cases. Just the nature and competitiveness of the game made it a thrill to play and could get your adrenaline pumping. Ive never met someone who Id say I hated over the game but there have been plenty of people that irritated me and annoyed me thats bound to happen when people are arguing on forums with each other and hunting each other down every day in the game.,MMORPG,cembl6z,0,t5_2qlxw

Also as some pointed out not being max level is often a waste of time because of how silly gear progression is in theme parks. You could be getting tokens that get you new gear while doing exactly the same stuff youre doing while not being max level. The problem for me is theme parks with tier loot progression the way they are designed punishes you for not being max level this with mentioned quest monotony make me always race to the level cap... that is unless I decide to uninstall the game before that.,MMORPG,cf7jmlq,1,t5_2qlxw

370092,0,t3_1yaxrw,I played WoW from beta up until Firelands with random relatively small breaks in between and this saddens me.Some of my best memories in gaming and some of the most amazing people Ive ever met were due to random encounters when leveling or just wandering around.  Im aware the social exploration aspect of WoW has been a shadow of its former self for a while but this seems like the nail in the coffin.  Its a totally optional service which is fine.. seems a bit expensive but like I said totally optional.  It just seems like when someone chooses to level a character now itll feel like a waste of time because they could just pay for it.  Unless you particularly enjoy leveling youre not doing it for any reason other than saving  now.. and I dont know how I feel about that.The endgame is really where WoW shines and has always shined though so I definitely see what theyre getting at.  A lot of amazing memories exist from raiding too.

420469,0,t1_cfocahc,No Ive never heard that term before lol. Games have either soft targeting which is what ESO and Neverwinter do where you aim in the general direction of your target and it locks on as long as you stay in the area of the target. But if you move away from the target it will untarget them or miss them so you need to ensure youre aiming properly when you hit  the system just makes it far easier to do so. But the built in dodgeblockparry skills these games have ensure that your target if its a player can still avoid the damage if they time their defenses properly. I prefer this system as it makes aiming easier and keeps the fun of not having to tab target especially as a healer but it still keeps skill a factor.Or auto lock on is something like GW and TSW where youre locked on to the target no matter what and can even hit a hotkey to ensure you dont target something else if your mouse moves away. Yulgang  also does this and TERAs few lock on skills do this as well although most of TERAs other attacks are free aiming but not hard to aim in reality.Edit For the record TERA is still by far the best combat of any game out there right now.,MMORPG,cfocid1,0,t5_2qlxw

Were lucky  our costs are wrapped up in our license of the Pathfinder world.  Our game comes with a builtin audience of millions of people who have been exposed to the brand.I took a quick look at their website so I cannot claim to be an expert on the product but heres the notable difference I see right off the bat  There doesnt seem to be a playerdriven ingame economy.  The website doesnt talk about crafting.  So I assume that if there is crafting its WoWstyle crafting not EVEstyle crafting and if theres an economy its a simple auction house not markets.  There doesnt seem to be persistence in the game world.  Players cannot build persistent structures or tear them down.  The players seem able to capture fixed locations in the warzone areas but they cant build up their own towns.  While our persistent Settlements wont be in our game when we begin Early Enrollment the whole game design is based around them so we intend to develop towards that goal as fast as possible.,MMORPG,cfua4me,2,t5_2qlxw

676238,0,t1_cgfpwev,I apologize for the novel Im pretty passionate when it comes to RuneScape.Jagex went far FAR beyond modernizing RuneScape. I would argue that RuneScapes gameplay wasnt outdated at all but rather humble and unique. RuneScape did many things right that allowed it to become a massive success and its downfall wasnt due to time but rather to the company going public and gradually shifting focus from the player to the players wallet.RuneScape started off as a humble indie project Andrew Gower and his brothers created DeviousMUD as a game they wanted to play and could from any computer with a browser. By complete accident it took off and became something much more. Soon after Jagex was founded and RuneScape was released.Fast forward several years after Jagex has gone public and RuneScape has become a huge success investors are chomping at the bit to get shares in the company. As investors began to collect more and more shares in the company they became increasingly involved in the development process.As investors who were interested in nothing other than turning a profit became increasingly influential in the games development many key developers left the company following censoring butchering and perversion of many of their ideas and the game as a whole.As a result of the aforementioned issues there were many highly questionable changes and updates released which overtime alienated much of RuneScapes fanbase. There were some outright insane changes made such as the removal of free trade and PVP which permanently crippled player numbers overnight.As time has gone on RuneScape has continued to slip further and further away from its former glory. Jagex has implemented so many money grabs into the latest versions of RuneScape that it is worse than many mobile games.Personally I thoroughly enjoyed RuneScapes skill quest economic and pvp systems all of which were unique and none of which I have seen implemented similarly in other games.,MMORPG,cgh5012,3,t5_2qlxw

706568,0,t3_2272tw,Guess Rift is one of the names which should be here.  A fair warning though not getting the desired DPS  HPS in dungeons will not make you friends and the usual effective builds have been already discovered. But feel free to use one of the builds from the forums for that and learn to make your own builds or change them to your liking and playstyle.   Classes  souls for each class  with the upcoming patch  souls per class to choose from  points to spend freely between them shit tons of synergies and you can add different roles which pretty much are your premade skillsets which you can switch to if youre outside of combat.  You can be pretty much everything with every class but without making them the same in terms of playstyle like cleric and mage healers are VERY different and both needed.    Also EvE Online more or less.  You can theoretically learn everything but this would need years and years. So you pretty much start with the stuff you need. But the skills are more just the passive requirement to use different fittings and ships and how good you are with them. Still very flexible if you want to.  There are some dated games like Ultima Online as well which I would only suggest on freeshards since the official servers are patched to death and currently being milked from EA as well. But you simply have passive skills which determine how good you are like swordsmanship all of them will go up by doing stuff like fighting with a sword usually capped at  and there are global skillcaps depending on the server you play on like  so you could up  skills to .,MMORPG,cgkl96d,1,t5_2qlxw

Basically they improved a lot of the things that were wrong with D. Nonetheless they screwed some shit up as well like making the areas feel less random.

779223,0,t1_cgsuf21,gt Its almost irrelevant to talk about because its not a viable goal for . of the player base. Its like winning the lottery.Its not though. Theres probably  people playing that game on Eve. Its the court intrigue of key friends and allies revolving around the handful of godlike players. Those are the lieutenants in the metagame. Their actions still matter a lot and they wield incredible power even though they arent literally the Mitanni type figure.In a smallscale MMO that sort of role is open to a vastly larger percentage of the population. Its achievable. In MUDs its insanely achievable where a single rogue player can undermine the power balance of the entire world or in some cases destroy the world. But even in a game like FFA EQ its still very achievable by somebody who strives for it.Of course the people who want that role are the worst people to have it but thats always the way it is.gt Lastly I wouldnt discount the gravitas of wielding power in the smaller ponds in eve. While the scale might be smaller the struggle can be intense and deeply complex.Fair enough.

There population of the game is really small which means there are never any boats to join no will anybody join your boats.  Also Vindictus has a horrible horrible loot system extremely low droprates and you can only run raids once a day.  And lets not forget the absolutely brutal enchantenhance system.  To get your gear even close to fulled set up you need to  through enhacing and apply at least one Rank  or above enchant scroll. Both of the things I just mentioned that are required to get good gear have a very high chance of destroying your weaponarmor.  However if you dont do that then you cant join a boat because of player induced restrictions like k Atk boat.Which brings me to my next topic pay to win.  Vindictus is horribly pay to win.  You can buy runes that will protect your gear so you can get it up to the lowest standard and you can buy a service that lets you run raids twice a day.  Both are around .

980679,0,t3_25c6bd,I would love to see a mix of the two the majority of equipment would be crafted by players and traded or sold to one another while there are a few powerful unique items to be found on tough monsters.Unfortunately it appears that looting is the only viable option in many of the newer MMOs.  Sure crafting is almost always included but it only really gives you an edge at lower levels and even then it feels like a waste of time.  Why should I spend hours grinding my weapon crafting skill when I can spend that same amount of time grinding my combat skill and end up getting equipment that is up to par  or even stronger  than what I couldve crafted?  Once I hit the level cap Ill just be grinding bossesdungeons for the best loot anyways!So yes I heavily favour crafting but I will always love the feeling of slaying the dragon and pulling out a shiny new Helmet of AssKicking from its corpse!,MMORPG,chfrfc9,2,t5_2qlxw
984367,0,t1_chg5u2k,gt If the fact that the item is crafted is just a triviality and isnt really any different than turning in commendations to get the item in most respects than I dont view it as crafted in the first place. For example if the crafting allows for no customization either in mechanics or cosmetics or does not require any real work outside of the raiding then it doesnt really matter.Well no TERAs crafted gear requires you to get the items from various different sources after you have found the recipes or purchased them off the broker  so that too can be hard to get. A couple different endgame dungeons as rare BoP drops some quests associated with them that reward other items and you need to make a previous very grindy crafted set as an ingredient as well that requires a different dungeon with a different rare BoP drop various reputation vendors some items from open world elite mobs and some other stuff. Basically you have to do every imaginable type of PvE in the game repeatedly since you need multiples to make just one piece of gear. The PvP sets are the same amount of grindiness and require you to do a ton of every kind of PvP to get the necessary mats. Of course they do have gear that drops from dungeons and sets that can more easily be earned via PvP vendors but those arent as good as the crafted sets. Although in true Korean fashion once you craft the gear you need to spend a lot of time and gold masterworking and enchanting it before its worth wearing.,MMORPG,chg6i51,1,t5_2qlxw

1134846,0,t1_chx93ik,I take it you havent played ESO or Wildstar then as those are both big titles and about as themepark as you can get. If you are talking a  years from now with things like Everquest Next and whatever SOEs new SWG crowd pleaser game then I can agree with you. I want to reiterate that I do prefer sandbox games there just hasnt really been a good one imo since SWG. I tried playing Eve but to me it just wasnt fun. Its basically microsoft excel the game in space and has a pretty big barrier to entry because of the real time based skill leveling. All the other sandbox games Ive tried have just been downright grindfests and that style of gameplay has been proven to only appeal to the asian market.The only point I am trying to make is that SWTOR wasnt the incredibly massive failure you are saying it is. You are very correct in that it didnt perform to EAs expectations but then they were expecting it to kill WoW while launching with not even half the content WoW has. They severely underestimated content locusts. ESO tried to combat this with VR ranks but it just turned out to be a grind that actually drove away more players than it retained.  If anything ESO is turning out to be more of a failure than SWTOR its just harder to tell because of the mega server technology. ,MMORPG,chxa3ec,1,t5_2qlxw

At one point I counted at least a dozen other players doing the same thing in the background.Shit like that really kills the immersion of the game.  The story itself in TOR was fairly decent but that kind of stuff really killed it.  Its not really something that is new to the genre.  There really should be a better way to go about these quests.

1220526,0,t3_282wlt,Its still in beta so expect some flaws.Has a pretty cool if a bit costly in terms of Ingame currency item leveling system. Basically Items can be leveled to  by using other items as materials. Once it hits  find another weapon of the same name and you can smelt it which ups the limit to  it actually goes higher than  not sure how much higher though and allows you to add different things to your weapon like  damage  chance to not lose durability upgrade a skill on the weapon because skills are tied to the weapon and not your character. The reason why I say its a bit costly is if you want to upgrade a Gold Tier weapon its going to run you quite a bit of Ryou the ingame currency but a Bronze Tier weapon is really cheap.The voices are in Japanese but all text is in English. All in all its pretty refined. There are a couple typos but they arent very frequent.

I recently got back into it after taking a year break from mmorpgs and I realized that I took runescape for granted after trying so many new mmorpgs like guild wars  and tera. The questing is the best in any mmorpg hands down especially the grandmaster quests. They are actually WORTH doing and all the quests including the smaller ones have great story that even tie together with others. The quests are rewarding and can permanently affect your character like having new skillsaccess to new locations. The crafting is really in depth but a bit grindy which is ok for me and the economy is around  player driven which is good.Unique skills such as slayer prayer and even construction are all present in the game. The sense of achievement you get from killing a certain boss or doing a quest without a wikiguide is the best I have experienced in any mmorpg and I have tried about  mmorpgs since .

I know of no weapons or armor that you can buy that is better than ingame loot.  In short you can purchase conveniences in the game but you do not need to purchase anything other than packs to play the game.  And if you purchase adventure packs then you dont need to grind the same fp content  but that is just common sense. PW means that you need to pay for special advantages in order to win.

1347119,0,t1_cil4ved,Wakfu has a lot of things that are awesome in theory like the player driven governments environments server participation to dig through mines but there really isnt enough of a population to support them unfortunately dofus has a much larger playerbase.  That and the game feels unfinished.  There is gear beyond the max level cap because they have not finished raising it some other things.The main thing that drove me away though was the combat was awful compared to dofus.  In wakfu the maps tend to be much shorter range and there is a smaller number of players you are allowed to have on a team which too me just makes it less epic.  There are a lot of cool class mechanics but they generally result in very one dimensional builds.  It all makes the game feel spammy not tactical combat.  Another thing adding to the spamminess is that it is not finished so you cant have the amount of AP at endgame that you can in dofus currently which of course makes dofus feel like you can do a broader variety of things on your turn..  And in dofus it is far more common in my experience to have a much wider variety of spells you have and spells you actually use so again more options makes combat more tactical.  The WORST thing about wakfu combat though by far is the spell leveling system.  Instead of using spell points to level spells the spells you use most in a fight gain xp.  It sounds cool like the spells you use the most will level with you but in practice it means you can basically only use your  best spells in combat over and over to get max xp for them if you want to be optimally minmaxed.  Makes combat boring as hell.,MMORPG,cil60ik,2,t5_2qlxw

I am a soloist so by the time they added advancement to level   AA were required to advance.  As a soloist and mainly crafterbased I now had  level  crafters of varying levels but I focused on levels not AA.  So as I got to level  on solo content and no AA slider alteration Id have about  AA.  That meant I had many many characters that had to grind about  AA in order to advance in levels.  That was prohibitive and I left the game for a little while.  I got over it I came back and I started grinding.  I love the game I thought AA were fine and a great sideline until they became no longer Alternate but retroactive required advancement.  I have since spent a lot of money to catch a bunch of my characters up on AA so I can continue on without years of pointless grinding to catch up.

I dont know if they ever added a group finder or any way to do it in game but back when i was playing it was really easy to get something together for just about anything by plugging your name into those sites or joining a group lfm.  Unfortunately there isnt a whole lot to do once you finish all the dungeons and stuff off in GW takes about a week with pugs to clear them all.  The good thing about its FP status though is you can return for whatever content update they are pumping out for new things to do over time.

1426483,0,t1_civ0wta,Indeed. I like to use a bakery analogy You want cookies and there are two bakeries selling cookies. One will sell you a box of cookies for  but wont let you have any samples. The other will let you have their day old cookies for free but if you want the fresh ones you have to pay. It seems that the one offering free samples has a LOT more confidence in their product.One major advantage of FP in gaming is that you can have a certain category of customer. Consider that all PP game players fall into three categories Current player former player never played. FP has a fourth category Inactive player. I havent played Tera or Path of Exile in a very long time and while those games dont hold much attraction for me anymore I dont hesitate to recommend them to others if I feel its a game they would enjoy. However Im a former world of warcraft player and thus its not a game Id recommend just from having a negative enough experience to quit the game.

However theres a whole army camped out at that button so you bring an army of your own. Unfortunately you cant just attack the army but rather theres five people attacking you and are only flagged to you. None of your friends can also attack them. Whats more if they have healers the healers never get flagged for PVP for healing people. As such the defenders advantage is set up to enable people to make a full time game of just blocking other people from completing their quests.,MMORPG,ciwgcm1,1,t5_2qlxw

1468037,0,t3_2az98e,Pros  Nice graphics and a unique detailed world  Amazing music probably my favorite of any MMO  Decent story that is always evolving with each patch  Solid challenging content throughout the leveling process and endgame  at endgame there is something for everyone whether you are casual or hardcore  Good variety in the PvE content  you can do dungeons FATEs trials duty roulette hunts  there are a lot of different ways to get the gear you want it doesnt pigeonhole too much you into doing certain things to be viable gear wise for harder content  Steady release of quality content with each patchCons  Once you hit max level it is a gear treadmill all there is to do at endgame is farm Tomes so that you can farm for better gear and the cycle goes on and on it is very much a skinner box  PvP is seriously lacking even after frontlines it feels like an afterthought this is not the game for you if you are a big PvPer  long GCD makes lower level content a bit boring but once you reach endgame you have enough abilities that are off the GCD and have to worry about enough mechanics that it will pick up quite a bit  it doesnt bother me much  everything is very very instanced.  For example the  main cities are comprised of  instanced zones each.  The world does not feel open or connected to me and at endgame I feel like Im sitting in a matchmaking lobby most of the time when Im not actually in a dungeon.  The zones themselves are not overly big either.    There isnt much that makes your character any different from anyone elses.  Every Paladin plays exactly the same as every other Paladin.  You dont get to develop your character in any unique way whatsoever outside of choosing which classes youd like to play.  I feel like the game lacks a truly meaningful sense of character progression outside of the gear grind.Not really a Pro or Con but it is worth mentioning that it is shamelessly a themepark  very much an on the rails sort of experience.  Also you can play every class on one character Im not a huge fan of this because I love making alts.As you may be able to tell I have more problems with the game than I do admiration for it but thats mainly because of the type of player I am.  I enjoy PvP unique character development in regards to specializations and massive open worlds.   I also am not a fan of gear treadmills.If you are primarily a PvEer who doesnt mine a lot of instancing and gear grinding Id definitely recommend looking into it.  Its a solid game and a beautiful world and Yoshi P is awesome.  It also seems to have a pretty great community unless you are in Crystal Tower P  You also need to like Asianthemed MMOs.  If Kawaii type stuff bothers you it bothers me I dont like cute MMOs stay away it will get annoying.  Everything is overly pretty and cute.  Even the Roe race which are giant seafaring warriors will often have males with purple faces and neon green hair and sometimes even makeup.I think that as far as themeparks go with lots of good PvE content Rift is a better game and it is free  but that is entirely personal preference.  You may enjoy FFXIV a lot more for all I know.,MMORPG,cj0al9d,5,t5_2qlxw
1475544,0,t3_2b2li7,Ive only played beta for a day but I still have my doubts. I have a tough time believing that I will be able to keep up at all without the labor point bonus not to mention the consumables. Especially early on I ran out pretty quickly and it feels like a big restriction until you start pooling some labor in downtime. With all the bonuses I feel like I would need to be play  more than someone with Patron to keep up with them.The auction house stuff sounds like an annoyance but it seems like they want to allow FP players a way in but the housing stuff is pretty annoying. Their current stance is you just straight up cant place a house can I build one at all? Why am I even allowed to buy house plans then?. It seems pretty important to some people and I dont like that Im not even given the option.Of course people who have  invested already are going to say it will be fair dont worry as they snicker behind your back.

They have lightened up on the grind to a point that youll be able to fight lesser bosses in a few weeks of casual play it has an actionRPG playstyle and any pw aspects are at the top end of the game.

Yes you split XP in groups but youre also killing mobs at  to  times the speed AND youre getting higher quality drops. There are a lot reasons why it might be difficult for an individual to find a group including the size of the playerbase LFG tools time of day difficultyduration versus reward of a specific dungeon etc. But that does not mean that soloing is easier. In my mind that is why games should have both. You get in the LFG queue and questgrind while youre waiting. Easier if you have a guild. If youre a social playerI dont see why you wouldnt get a guild. I tend to join guild just to talk about my interests not necessarily to group. If all anybody wants to do in guild chat is get more people to run dungeons I leave.,MMORPG,ck3yreo,1,t5_2qlxw
1785974,0,t3_2eypdi,Aion is carried by its flying. Without that it would suck pretty much. As novel as that was way back when its just not so interesting anymore. The problem with PVP in any MMO currently is that they have to baby the player base to attract a larger customer base. The facts are people have been force fed these theme parks for so long they are scared of more aggressive play styles.The result is to placate the smaller PVP desiring player base MMO devs do a few things Arena based PVP. This worked just fine until it became painfully obvious that if I want the arena PVP style I can simply pick up one of the numerous MOBAs and have allot more fun. Almost every AAA title has this and they seem to think its the end all solution to pvp. More than likely its just a cheap in terms of development way to pacify PVPers without letting it spill over into the territory of the cuddly little PVE land. In rare cases Open World PVP. Theres some major problems with this. You had games such as Ultima Online Lineage etc in which you would drop everything with various ways to mitigate the drop rate. So you spend  weeks farming to get a legendary sword step outside town and boom legendary sword gone. I think we can all agree this sucks. So to try and attract more people devs changed the loot dropping. Now days with the exception of  mmos there is no loot drop which creates a huge problem well talk about later. Territorial PVP. Even fewer mmos do this. Aion is technically one of them. Duels. Nuff said.So to cover the mmos you mentioned Aion Open World PVP Territorial PVP sort of Lineage  I havent played this so i could be wrong but Open world PVP Territorial PVP Tera Open world PVP sort of and Arena Based PVP Duels WoW Duels I dont really count this and Arena Based PVP yes yes technically theres OW but common no one does it anymoreHeres the problem with the modern and by modern I mean pretty much anything released after the success of WoW Open World PVP. When you have Open World PVP you must have a Gain amp Loss mechanic. Without it the PVP is meaningless. AKA Tera Rift and WoW to name a few. You have to have something to fight for. As we have seen in games like call of duty league of legends smite etc. This reward can be as simple as stats and shiny things on a stats page. Tera doesnt even have that. Some games have tried to make PVP mean something in the most retarded of ways pure gain mechanic. Loss ie death still means nothing but you can gain special points to buy items through killing players. Who would possibly be stupid enough to implement this mechanic in an AAA title you ask? The dev team of SWTOR. Guess what happened. People stood in huge lines in the PVP area trading kills back and forth for the points. There are only two MMOs that do it right EVE Online and Darkfall.So why does it work in EVE? Because there is both gain loss and replenishment of that loss requires work from players. This works in EVE because you are not your ship You are a clone flying the ship. So if you lose the ship all your skills etc are still there you just buy a new ship which is the exact same as the last one you flew. In character based MMOs we get attached to our gear as it is a representation of our achievements etc. Its part of the identity of your character. The question you have to ask is how to implement meaningful PVP gain and loss in a character based MMO. I should give honorable mention to Darkfall a game which manages to do this by making the gear more of an attachment and very replaceable.Aions system is open world pvp and you can capture forts. You say well that sounds cool! No. The forts provide no real value to hold. Infact if you dont own the fort you can farm the enemy guards for points and various leveling areas open up. So what youll find is that super large guilds go in capture a fort and when they want the leveling area they simply give it up.Teras system of open world is GVG. You can declare war on a guild and then attack them outside cities. Which means fuck all. If they dont want to fight they will just drop from the guild and rejoin later. There is no benefit to killing and you lose nothing when you die. This is literally an exercise in EPEEN and trolling. The arena is decent but you can only do it so much before you begin to wonder why you spent  months leveling this character and dealing with the ridiculous RNG just to run around the same fucking map over and over. Oh and doing the arena is the only way you can get PVP gear. Without the PVP gear from the arena you will be absolutely useless in open world combat.Ultimately this is a tough mechanic to implement in an Open World environment from a developer standpoint. Now combine that with the fact that while people are bored with the current themeparks no one has seen a PVP system that works in a character based MMO. End result is they all scream they dont want it or to compartmentalize it or just make sure it doesnt hurt too much when you die. So devs and more importantly the investors to these devs say theres not enough demand. From their standpoint it is simply not profitable to spend the development time on PVP mechanics that work. MMOs are built to make money and pay back the investors.TLDR So to wrap it all up youre screwed. There are some FTP MMOs out there that half ass it but they are pay to win PTW. If you really want good PVP go pick up a MOBA. DOTA League of Legends and Smite are probably the best right now. There are some other options if youre really into superheros etc. If Im forced to chose from your original criteria though I would say Archeage which will be PTW but does use tab target like u wanted Lineage II and Tera also PTW in that order. I would like to mention DC Universe has really fun PVP and is not PTW. Downside is its absolutely pointless you die and res and go back and theres no gain either and while I enjoy it you said you wanted tab target over action based. Overall that game is just fun to play though. Good luck on your search.P.S. I had planned to write about territorial PVP as well.. but christ this got too long.,MMORPG,ck49wt7,2,t5_2qlxw

1922644,0,t1_ckko1a8,This is also why I enjoy action combat healing more than anything else. In games like TERA you have all of that healing stuff to worry about but in addition you need to keep your enemies debuffed keep certain active short term buffs on your friendlies use your CCs wisely to keep the enemy healer or other pesky person at bay actively prevent yourself from getting CCd via various means which is a literal constant battle by itself actively avoid other damage. Its insane.Its not just the fact that its more active. Its more fun to heal when youre able to do it while focusing on the battle and dont need to pay attention to raid frames because youre much more immersed in and feel like youre a part of the battle the same way DPS often do. Youre not just standing there clicking on the UI because Ill be honest that was fun years ago but Im over it also why I didnt go healer in Archeage lol. Then on top of that you have to actively avoid damage and CC and your party is expected to do the same because there isnt really any passive defenses. Plus the games that give the healer more responsibilities than just healing and give them a more all around role are more fun and interesting too I think. Its not just keeping that HP near or at full anymore but a real support role.,MMORPG,ckkv5fa,1,t5_2qlxw

1962201,0,t3_2h5bs5,ArcheagegriprageAA has a lot of issues. almost all of them are related to how the publisher Trion is handling things. if you havent been keeping up theyve done a lot of really shady stuff. there are several posts so i wont go int a lot of detail. if the companys ethics arent important to you than we can still talk about what AA has to offer. but if the idea of supporting a company that does very questionable things irks you then i would say stay away from AA and trion. I havent played the release version. but this was my impression from beta.Labor points are a major downside. patron status allows you to generate more but LP are the lifeblood of the game. you cant do anything meaningful without an abundance of LP. if you play casually you wont have issues with LP. but if youre going to play hardcore youre going to find yourself short a lot. LP creates some major barriers and it also promotes botting. you always generate more LP while online. and if youre online  you might as well get more bang for your buck. because almost all other items are available through grinidng thats really the only major perk of patron status access to more LP. there are a few other convenience things but i cant remember all of them. I always had doubts about AAs scalability. and given the long queue times my worries look like they were well founded. the community is shapping up to be very toxic and trion is doing little to appease customers and keep the peace. because its a PvP focused endgameengine PvE content is boring and uninspired. if you want good PvE than AA is not a viable choice. i would try AA on a trial basis. i would also wait at least another month before considering it as a full time game. its launch so far is extremely rocky and its hard to get any good data with the server issues and the general toxicity around Trions handling of founders starter packs early access and the gamebreaking bugs. its current state is terrible. im not sure its a good assessment of how it will pan out. a lot can happen. I cant say enough good things about FFXIV. its a solid themepark MMO. if youre enjoying it now youll likely continue to enjoy it. the dev team is awesome. content releases are predictable. communication is good between the devs and the player base. somethings do get lost in translation but overall i cant recommend FFXIV enough. TLDR FFXIV is a solid choice. right now its hard to tell how goodbad AA is its not in a good state at all right now. the game is fun. it has potential but it may fall due to bad publishing. approach with caution. ,MMORPG,ckpnasu,4,t5_2qlxw
1965673,0,t1_ckq12xc,Right now its terribly difficult to tell how casual will interact.  The economy is far from established.  Just logging on is a chore.  Noob questing is a struggle not to kill mobs but to kill mobs before someone else kills them.  You group not out of necessity to stay alive or to xp more efficiently well you do but thats not what I mean but just to share in the kill tally from the hunt a pig quest that  people are slaughtering as quick as they spawn.There are mechanisms to allow flat broke people to play every aspect of the game itll just cost more time and effort.  I think its too soon to say how much that time sink will affect FP.  The in game price in game imaginary  of APEX cash shop  is variable from server to server and day to day.  As for crafted gear which should be best gear there is little to base price speculation on.  Mats have for the most part already flooded the market pushing the prices down below what was seen in closed AB some mats not all.TLDR I dont know how casual any  player is but Ill make a stab at it.  If it would take you  month to reach well gear level  as a paying player it guessspeculatestab widly at might take you . months as FP.

2013130,0,t3_2hsr9c,when i first started playing eve online i honestly had no idea what the fuck was going on due to how crazy difficult the learning curve was.  i found myself in a small corporation guild that specialized living in wormholes.  The best way to describe a wormhole WH is that it is like an instanced dungeon in that it is a separate space from the main world except that anybody can raid your instance and kill you  take your stuff.  There are no rules in a wh anything can happen.Anyways I was in this guild and getting to learn people and trying to pvp and stuff and while hanging out on teamspeak my corporation ceo guild leader said that we had a few new recruits a girl and a boy they said they were a gaming couple and were interested in learning about wh space.  They seemed like a good lot so I didnt mind just chilling with them.  I became busy with reallife stuff for a month and when i logged back in i noticed that ALL the stuff we had in our wormhole was gone....and all my corporation mates were not to be found.  Our playerownedstation POS which provides a safezone for players as well as a hangar for ships and equipment in wormholes had turned into what was known as a flytrap.A flytrap is when someone takes down your tower POS anchors their own tower in its place fits it with guns that will kill you AND places a large warpdisruption bubble on the tower which TRAPS you and prevents you from running away hence the term flytrap.  It just leaves you vulnerable to anybody who wants to lock you up and blast you into nothingness.  An unsuspecting player will log in and find themselves  in a trap unable to warp away and soon killed by the guns of the tower or killed by the people who set up the POS.  I lost the ship I was in and all i had left were questions.  These were the circumstances that occurred according to my corpmatesMany months before our corporation even had a wormhole to live in a group of mischievous thieves decided to undertake an operation called PROJECT NEMESIS.  In short PROJECT NEMESISs aim was to infiltrate wormhole corporations befriend the denizens and ultimately steal everything and kill anyone who would try to stop them.The aforementioned girlboy couple were a part of NEMESIS and had been feigning to be new to wormholes to my CEO at the time.  The girl grrr internet girlz had convinced my CEO to give her corporation roles like giving her guild bank access so that she could set up her own POS to start harvesting planetary goods to manufacture weapons and such.  My CEO thought it was a fairly innocent request so he granted her the rights and she set up her POS and seemed happy to do so.  However late in the night she logged on when nobody else except her accomplice were online and began to take all of the stuff from our guild bank.  BILLIONS of isk that took months to makesavestore were gone within SECONDS.  After she and her friend secured all the loot she took down our corporations MAIN tower POS set up her own anchored a large warpdisruption bubble and activated the towers guns to shoot us when we logged in.  As expected my corporation mates were utterly decimated upon logging in.  They would log in find themselves trapped in the bubble and summarily blasted into smithereens within a few seconds.  And they had nothing to fight back with since all of their stuff had been stolen.  Many people quit the corporation after that and it never really recovered.  As for me a newbie project NEMESIS really showed me how dark cruel brilliant and creative Eve Online really was.  PROJECT NEMESISs name soon started showing up in game forums and such and MANY other stories about wormholes being tricked by their excellent team started to flood the network.  It inspired me to follow in their footsteps to pursue paths that were frowned upon in other games.  Ive never looked back since.,MMORPG,ckvs1w7,3,t5_2qlxw

2322497,0,t3_2lwboi,It was the first truly mainstream MMO Ok so Meridian  was technically the first but very few people even know of its existence let alone have played it. As you saw from the videos it definitely hasnt aged well but during its hayday it was extremely epic. Its also based on legendary IP that we had been playing for years before the world wide web was even a thing. Its still the epitome of what a sandbox game should be. The crafting is still unmatched SWG came pretty close in complexity but resource gathering was still way easy mode compared to UO. I had a friend that played for about  years and never engaged in combat after he discovered crafting. There were no levels. You just raised your skills gradually by doing different tasks. Its also extremely brutal. You die you lose everything. Even mobs would rummage through your corpse and steal shit and you had to hunt them down to get it back. You could be ganked at anytime by anybody anywhere outside of a city. Its also the only MMO to actually explain the different servers in the storyline Ever wonder why people sometimes call MMO servers shards? UO is why. Lord British showed everyone what was possible with the always online voodoo of the time. UO is the reason we got Everquest and Asherons Call and it snowballed from there to where we are now for better or worse. Most of us oldschoolers that cut out teeth on UO are still waiting for something to rival it. It may not be much to look at now but its got content where it counts. Back in the day it had all kinds of weird little quirks too. My favorite was called server wars. When the servers went down for nightly maintenance the server would stop recording data about three hours before you had to log off. So when this time rolled around it became anarchy. You threw on all you magic armor and pulled out your halberd of vanquishing things you would usually never wear outside of town and went on a killing spree or a dying spree depending on the night. It was great times. Lets also not forget about player housing. Like real player housing where you placed your housetowercastle in the actual game world. This made houses mad expensive once real estate ran thin. You could even hire vendors to stand at your house and sell shit for you. With all the free shards up nowadays id definitely give it a go. ,MMORPG,clyrw1j,30,t5_2qlxw

2344765,0,t1_cm1iiz8,First Ive seen of this game but it looks like they have been in development for years.  The article posted is an awesome read about the dynamic world in the game.  Everything made by people evolving world lasting consequences of your actions.  Awesome little read for a sandbox nerd like me!!Ill post the story they have in the dev diary.gtImagine this scenario a faction has become extremely wealthy by selling titanium armor which has been mined for months from within the factions borders. Finally the source of Titanium runs out while exploring one of their members discovers a huge cache of titanium while exploring. It is about a ten minute ride by horse the only problem is the area is completely infested with trolls that have become extremely strong since they have been left alone for many weeks. The ranger also finds the trolls keeping a dragon which if slain can yield dragon teeth dragon bone and dragon hide all of which are some of the best crafting materials available. gtSo the faction makes plans a couple days in advance the faction leader creates a mandatory mission for all faction members to escort him to the spot the scout found. He sets a fair reward of gold coins upon completion and almost the entire faction shows up on the day of the raid. They create a few giant hand carts which will help them haul their loot and set off. While the pace is slow they come across many lesser troll villages stray elk bears even a small village of a rival faction which they burn to the ground and are able to kill and loot  players kill  NPCs and capture  NPCs who will be forced into slavery if they survive the journey to the main troll camp. gtWhen they finally get to the troll camp they fight through a dozen troll buildings sustaining only minor casualties. In the center of the camp is the dragon which they defeat after a very difficult  minute long fight. The adventurers finish killing all of the trolls take whatever loot they can use and then move on to the business of mining as much Titanium from the area as they can carry. After a good hour of mining they assign the NPC slaves to carry the carts and start for home after hearing from their highest level armorer that they will have enough titanium to last them for a week. That is of course if they can keep the roads to and from their city safe enough to continue to allow adventurers customers to traverse on their way to the wilderness.a pic from the article showing tree and buildingAnd here is some of their featuresgtFactions is a completely different style of MMORPG. Where most MMOs follow the same tried and tested pattern of premade storydriven content. Factions strives to provide a completely unique experience. An almost completely untapped game play style in the Fantasy MMO genre. gtSome sandbox games promise openended game play only to disappoint the player with the lack of essential sandbox features like the ones explained below. Factions strives to appeal to the niche gamer who craves a more realistic openended fantasy MMO. It will not appeal to every joe schmo and their sister as mass market games attempt to do. gtFactions allows the player to play whatever role they choose. Whether you are more interested in combat crafting faction andor town management building a business empire or any combination of these things you will be able to play exactly how you want to. gtNothing will have a preset price in the game and all materials and products will be worth only what the buyer will pay. gtThere are no gear vendors with gear that spawns out of thin air. If you see a NPC gear vendor he is hired by a player or faction told where to stand and who to sell to and his stock is provided by that player or faction. Infact if the vendor was killed the stock could be looted. The factions economy is the most open ended ever created for an MMO even the currency is created by players. gtThere is no starting area as a new player you have the choice of starting in the wilderness alone or starting in a faction that welcomes new players you will be able to choose which of these factions to start in. When you first spawn you will have only the rags on your back and a small bag it will be up to you to work adventure beg borrow or steal to secure your spot in the world. gtFactions can control territory build towns and wage war against rival factions. gtRules can be established to control how your faction is governed how it interacts with other individuals and other factions and how it handles infractions on its sovereignty. gtFactions and even powerful and well developed individual players can hire NPCs to perform duties around their towns and frontiers. Manning a guard post farming a field providing vendor services for your goods patroling a busy corridor and more can all be handled by NPCs. This will allow the players to log off of the game and know their town will not fall apart without them immediately. They will require upkeep in the form of pay andor food from your fields.

2399360,0,t1_cm83aq4,thats kind of a difficult question to answer because there are two aspects to it. The first aspect is Carbine the developers. they released the game with too many bugs and too many unoptimized systems. some of which are fixed now but the whole process of fixing whats broken is slowed down by the inefficiency of Carbines developers and their development cycle. The second aspect is the core engine of the game and the way the game was designed to be played. a lot of this has been adjusted now but some of the endgame dungeons required you to get gold status in order to get loot. essentially this mean perfect runs. which created and cultivated a very elitist attitude. essentially more casual and newer players were always left out and they had no way to catch up because noone wanted to waste time teaching them dungeons. There was also the atunement process which was a  day grind depending on your skill level to get access to the more endgame related features. there was also some content like world bosses which werent really done because the rewards werent on par with difficulty. some other smaller issues such as itemization were also problems but i cant speak to how that has improved. To break it down the major problems were  carbine  the community  core game features  itemization  poor optimization in PvP match making. ,MMORPG,cm89oug,3,t5_2qlxw

I love sifting through cards and building decks in Magic so I love sifting through abilities and building decks equally in TSW. Also though its not perfect progression in TSW is very horizontal.

If I were to see a giant mountain and wonder whats on the other side Id excitedly explore to the other side and find... nothing.Basically the game was severely lacking in adventure. The game has a lot of good mechanics and such in it especially taming and how pets work but theres a lot missing in the world.

2665336,0,t1_cn6h6rl,Yeah I can see what you mean. In another post in this thread I address the OPs original post more directly by explaining how I disagree that there isnt innovation in the MMO space. Plenty of games innovate a great deal on the model but they tend to fail on a technicality by missing too many key features or messing up the payment model Wildstar didnt fail because it was too hardcore but because it was buggy and lacked a few key features ArcheAge was innovative but its reputation was tarnished by the payment model the publishers in the West went with even ESO was innovative in many ways building on ideas from DAoC and other games but it too was lacking key features. Given the immense complexity of developing an MMO these days developers have to first meet expectations before they can surpass them by providing brand new game elements. This is what games like Everquest FFXI SWG DAoC and WoW did when they were big they took concepts from DampD Ultima Online Anarchy Online etc. and just improved on them. The mythical MMO that was pure innovation has never existed in reality the models you have are either theme park WoW and others sandbox ArcheAge for example or sandpark FFXI is probably an example of this  all of them built on past ideas when they first launched and became more unique over time... you also have pseudoMMOs like Diablo... Eve is probably the one MMO that stands out the most but even it built on ideas from other games before it.Innovation is very rarely revolutionary in any industry. Evolutionary innovation is far and away more common especially as fields mature since most core concepts will be covered pretty early on and all that is left is to improve and add marginally new ideas. The analogy I used in my previous post was Tesla and the electric car plenty of other companies have tried to launch electric cars but werent met with much success but what Tesla did differently was to provide an electric model that was as attractive as any other car in terms of design and functionality. Consumers arent turned off simply by the innovation and novelty of an electric car they just have a set of requirements that must be met before they actively consider buying one. Designing a car that meets these requirements is expensive so the marketing plan had to be adapted in order for the company to survive past launch. This is precisely what happens in MMOs. Given how expensive they are to make developers have to balance inventive new ideas and ticking off the checklist of required features. If they can provide enough of the latter at launch then they have a chance to survive and add more to the former as time goes on. What WoW did was innovative and it paid off. FFXI my alltime favourite MMO was also extremely innovative even though it started out with plenty of ideas from Everquest. My point is that the ideas in place in FFXIV are also innovative because of the twists the game puts on them and how they are delivered. Since they have secured a place in the MMO space now the truly new and inventive ideas can be layered on through patches and expansions much like FFXI and WoW did in the past. Patch . is bringing the Gold Saucer and the Aetherial Wheel two features that should be very unique. Then we have Heavensward which will shake up the model even more. EDIT I find the producer of FFXIV YoshiPs presentation at GDC last year to be very interesting when it comes to this topic. He explains that he made a list of about  key design features that had to be in place for a game to succeed in the MMO space today. He then let the developers riff around those core concepts in creating the game. It just goes to show that creating an MMO these days is extremely complex and innovation can work but not without the features that players have come to expect. Most companies cant handle the complexity of developing a modern MMO and fail because they cant cover all the necessary bases. Have a look at these  slides from the presentation In the end my point is that games that innovate at the expense of core expected features dont survive long enough to truly shine. You have to meet expectations before you can truly shine in your own way and this has been true for all successful MMOs throughout the history of the genre. FFXIV is one of the few to do this well enough to survive as a subscription game and now they have lots of room to make FFXIV even more unique.,MMORPG,cn6hh3j,1,t5_2qlxw

2693240,0,t1_cn8an42,gt It has been proven time and time again investors knows crap about video games. Investors will only invest if they can see results and in the gaming industry by the time you can show results the game is already close to release and doesnt need the investment for development. Development stage is the most important stage of all Alpha allows major tweaks but not major changes.you dont go to an investor because they know something about your product. Investors know the market. they know risk management. you have to go to the investor and show them you have what it takes to make a quality product and take a piece of the market. At the end of the day video games are still a business. At the end of the day i have to decide where im putting my money. you cant convince someone who invests for a living to invest? Im going to be skeptical as well. gtThe game was a success I dont know what is your definition of a good game for me its when I can get online find players to play with and wreck havoc. Keep in mind Mythic Entertainment never advertise their game nothing I ever seen word of mouth and they got more than  subscriber in . Show me an MMO do the same thing without using social media you cant. For an MMO that only cost . million to make that is call success.youre talking about a completely different era. you cant use todays standards on such an old game. Social media didnt exist yet. youtube wasnt founded until . Myspace wasnt founded until . DAOC was released when the MMO was in its infancy still back in . Games like Everquest and Ultima online were its major competitors. and these are what i would consider the titans of the time. but you also have to consider what the options were. In these early stages we had Ultima Everquest Asherons call and Final Fantasy XI. Its a little unfair to compare DAOC to FFXI Everquest or even Ultima. because these were backed by big studios. SquareEnix SOE and EA backed these three games. So you may take the underdog approach. but you have to remember EvE online also came from a small private studio. it has seen monumental success in comparison. its show steady growth and solid understanding of its niche. So sure. you can say that DAOC did good despite not having access to social media. but why should that even matter? Mythic had the same opportunities to go viral that these other games did. It still boils down to this They failed to deliver. Small indy studios today thrive on social media. If Mythic made the choice not to adapt new technology...it is just further proof how far behind they are and how bad they are at making decisions to make their games successful. k people were playing. why didnt they tell their friends to play? why didnt the game continue to grow? by the time they had k subs they should have been pulling enough money in to make changes release more content and draw in more people. they didnt. Id also like to see the source on DAOC only taking .m to make. gtWhat will probably happen ifwhen you purchase the game theyll put that money into marketing. Unfortunately marketing is only use to promote games not to make them better. Reason I say this is because nowadays game only has  chance to impress at least  of players its on the release date from there everything can go downhill if the game is crappy. Now not saying more money makes for a better game I think we all learn this from Star Wars Galaxies but considering what they were able to do with only . million makes you wonder what they could do with  times as much.I  agree. you have to come strong out of the gate. Trion made that mistake. Carbine made that mistake. but software and coding has gotten more complex and less disciplined over the years. and that really shows in the quality of the work we see in games. MMOs especially. These smaller studios have a lot more to prove to me especially because they have fewer resources and less structurediscipline. i cant count the number of times ive seen studios try to take shortcuts and just fall flat in terms of polish and quality. I think Jacobs is especially guilty of this and im expecting the same performance. unchained will be different. it will be refreshing. it will be good. but it wont be great. marketing in the MMO market is about one thing Hype.When i look at camelot unchained. Im interested. but im not hyped.   I think the formula is outdated. I dont think they have what it takes to adapt it to the modern market. From what ive seen and heard hes trying to make the same game again. and thats not going to be enough. hes playing the nostalgia card a little too hard. They could be playing their cards really tight to their chest. but i have to go by what I can see. And thats what i see.  Im not impressed with the track record of the developersdesigners so far. Theyve done good things but not great things. It will be different than what we have available in the market today. but we have a few very strong titles in the pipe right now and what im seeing so far from the team just isnt that impressive. Ive seen a few games at the stage unchained is at. and I feel they are behind their target. They have a lot of work ahead of them and they have major budget constraints. If they are smart they will have a plan similar to LiFYO. and they will release on a smaller scale first to try to pull more funding and get the big release right. Last I checked they had roughly m in funding. rougly .mm from crowd funding. m from Jacobs pocket. and about m from investors. at m over  years of development youre looking at a team of  people assuming they are being paid a respectable amount have decent working conditionsbenefits. and I just dont think thats enough peopletime to achieve their goals. but im speculating and making several bold assumptions. so well see.  its already known that they are going for a niche. Large scale PvP RvR style and the niche they have chosen has never been particularly popular or done particularly well. Large Scale PvP almost always descends into chaos and class balancing has always been incredibly difficult with the number of variables required to have engaging gameplay at this level. Given his track record he hasnt really shown he can be adaptable in this market so I dont have a lot of faith. ,MMORPG,cna4jer,1,t5_2qlxw

2858836,0,t3_2st3ae,While I disagree that most MMOs fail  there are lots that are still going with enough players to sustain them even if its not via a pure subscription model such as TSW SWTOR GW TERA Aion Rift etc.  I think the  main factors that cause problems for new MMOs are Innovation in games in general and MMOs more specifically has to be evolutionary as opposed to revolutionary. In other words it has to be iterative building on the trends of the gaming industry as a whole and branching out from there. By all means games can bring new ideas but if they dont deliver the baseline of required systems and features first they will have a rocky road ahead of them. Many games focus a lot on reinventing the wheel and end up neglecting aspects of the game that are vital in order for it to have longevity. Without a solid base these games will struggle to thrive past launch. An example would be Wildstars combat system while highly praised at launch and fun for a while it ultimately drove many to quit the game including toptier guilds because it became literally exhausting to play for hours and hours at a time in raids. Not only that but certain key elements of MMO combat had to be cut out in order to accommodate the new system like the ability to singletarget enemies since all actions were essentially AOE. Wildstar also lacked casual content and focused too much on grindy hardcore endgame to retain a substantial population. Given the sheer number of features new MMOs are required to have many developers simply arent up to the task of covering them all. A new MMO needs a decent group finder system questing story hardcore endgame content casual endgame content vertical and horizontal progression crafting playerdriven economy vanity gear some form of PvP large and regular content updates etc. Many games launch without these key features and see players leaving in droves because of it.  The payment model. Some games like ArcheAge fail on technicalities like adding things that are perceived as too much PW.I think an example of success is FFXIV. It has aimed to first ensure that all the required systems are in place before attempting to innovate too much. Its now one of the top MMOs on the market and is maintaining a successful subscription model. It offers massive content updates every . months and an expansion is coming in the next couple of months that promises as much content as the original A Realm Reborn launch. The producerdirector has said over and over how the expansion will bring a lot of surprises and new ideas that arent simply an extension of the current game. Now that they have survived past launch and provided the long list of required features they have room to innovate and truly make it stand out as a game in its own right.,MMORPG,cnt1ttv,7,t5_2qlxw

2890137,0,t1_cnwlh28,Its not a large market. As you pointed out most MMOs go FP not BP. There are two popular and successful examples. GW could count as well. And you could probably argue for the Diablo series as well even though they arent MMOs. Based on the early reports there is little to no reason to suspect that ESO will be like SWTOR. However SWTOR remains very popular these days. But its FP. If Rift doesnt count in your book neither does SWTOR.But Im not trying to make selling points. I am simply reserving judgment on a game that is genuinely good and has been steadily improving. When I see others cry about BP I point out that there are legitimate success stories out there. If you prefer to be negative and have a dismal outlook on gaming I can do nothing for you. The MMO industry needs somewhere to go. For most its not in subscriptions. For others FP has worked but its a buzzword that makes neckbeards rage so BP may well be a more reasonable option.,MMORPG,cnwm1jr,7,t5_2qlxw

I slowly realized however that not being a credit card warrior cheater or just willing to invest huge amounts of time I would never get to experience even a fraction of the potential of the sandbox aspects of the game.

2951791,0,t1_co3klu5,You might want to check out FFXIV. Its has a lot of systems that are fairly similar to WoW but with some unique twists. Its very accessible for casual and semihardcore players with tons of content. You can easily accomplish things with an hour a day to play but theres also things to work towards if you play for longer than that. I know people that dont raid and still find fun things to do for  hours per day.There is required grouping in the game but many people treat this as solo content anyway because of the excellent group finder system in the game. Without a guild you can do dungeons trialsprimals single epic boss encounters casual raids there are  main casual raids and also  old hardcore raids that are easier to do now through the group finder. Theres also plenty of side activities to do solo like beast tribe daily quests treasure maps hunts levelling additional classes you can switch classes at any time and all are accessible on a single character very indepth crafting gathering etc. In  or  weeks they are also adding the Gold Saucer an area filled with mini games like Chocobo racing mario kartequivalent and Triple Triad a fullyfledged card game. The first  or so levels feel like an extended tutorial and the combat can seem pretty slow for the first few levels. But it really ramps up towards level  and beyond. The combat is fastpaced and dynamic with plenty of room for skill at the higher tiers. Also there is a healthy RP community especially on the Balmung server. There are other servers with decent RP communities as well though.Its PP but theres a day free trial that will let you get to level  and experience a few dungeons and a primal fight.

Both TERA and ESO for one thing. And TERA does all of that without the reliance on massive telegraphs.

3079729,0,t1_coh2snq,Having spent the weekend playing the RU beta myself I can say Im not really concerned about what the FP shop will hold for this game for two main reasons  . Gear has a very small affect on the characters power. About  at best but gear is easily obtained by merely playing the game. The vast majority of power comes from character progression  your Ascension Atlas where you spend various gems earned from doing quests and instances which are all repeatable which you then spend in this complicated talent tree of sorts to gain extra stats new skills and talents. . With FP becoming so much more popular players are more knowledgeable and demand more fair stores so it would be quite hard for them to get away with a blatantly PW store and the chances of a Pay for Convenience shop are not likely IMO either. Some games have Pay for convenience stores which Im personally not a fan of but I dont see that happening here. Since the gearing and character progression system is very similar to  The Secret World except far larger and more complicated the most youll see is XP boosts which are largely pointless here because theres no level cap and no levels. Secondly I see costumes and classes being a big thing you can buy. Costumes are fine classes would be basically the same as an XP boost  either you earn it in game via a lot of grinding or you buy it I know the Russian preorder thing had two classes in there. Normally Id put that sort of convenience in the borderline PW category but this game doesnt have any way to win in that sense. Since theres no rush to level cap to beat people in raids or PvP its pointless because from what I can tell so far the entire game is about this character progression.Now just to be clear Im not a fangirl. You can skim my recent Reddit posts to see the various criticisms I have with this game. For me itll be a casual game at best that I hop in and out of mostly solo. But as for the PW potential from what I can tell the design of this game limits that quite a bit TSW style.,MMORPG,coh7mqv,-1,t5_2qlxw

3131890,0,t3_2w0pnr,Alright Ill give this a go. GW This was my first to play on this list. Guild Wars  was fun. I really enjoyed it. Like.. a lot. I played the hell out of it there are tons of ways to play the game. Guild Wars  is also very pretty and the lore is stunning. The worlds are pretty big and I loved the scaling that allows a high level to go do low level stuff and it not be faceroll easy. The issue with GW comes in at endgame mainly. Because the game doesnt support the trinity the endgame dungeons are pretty much a clusterfuck of button smashing. Nothing more. It gets old pretty quickly. The game supports living story meaning they bring in new content every few weeks which is awesome but to me it never brought anything amazing. It also doesnt help that theyve got an obsession with giving you backpacks as event rewards. Fuck off Ive got  of them. Give me something else. All in all GW is something I want to go back to but never do because I know that leveling is the fun part and once it is over the game feels over. ESO This was my second one to play. ESO was fun. It is really indepth. I stopped playing a few months back because Archeage came out and I wanted to try it. Dont try it. ESO has some really neat largescale PvP and the classes are amazing. The game is beautiful as is the lore. I really dont have anything negative about this game. It does was it does well and if it is your cup of tea it kicks ass. Ill most likely go back to it once it goes FP BP. WoW This is the one Im currently playng and thinking of stopping. World of Warcraft is a wonderful game and I really enjoyed it when I first picked it up about two months ago. My issues is that it is such a huge time sink. Im in college and have a job. My weekends are pretty much devoted to my girlfriend. I dont have an assload of time which is something this game requires. Leveling from  is pretty fun and the world is amazing as you advance. The dungeons are really fun as long as you dont get Captain Asswad who wants to pull everything before the tank is ready and the storyline is pretty cool. Once you get to max level you get a garrison which is basically a little fort with some followers and stuff. When I log on I feel like Im forced to do the dailies for the garrison. Which usually takes up enough time that I feel like I dont have time to do anytihng else. Raids and guilds are also an issue for me. Because Im busy it is almost impossible for me to set a raid time meaning Im left out of the good equipment. I can do LFR but it isnt nearly as good of equipment. My food is ready so Im going to cut this short. Over all Id say ESO is a really strong choice. Im planning on jumping to it once it goes FP BP. If youve got any questions or comments about any of these please let me know. Ill gladly answer anytihng or chat about them! Sorry for the confusion. I corrected my mistake.

3204103,0,t3_2wslpy,gtOn top of that i think Blizzard went INCREDIBLY greedy with Wow. not only that it has a subscription model it also has a cash shop. Wow became by far the most profitable Pcgame in history with a grossing of over  billion dollars  for a comparison the nd most profitable pc game has earned only . billion dollars. thats how greedy the payment model of wow really is.You do realize this is a business right? Theyre greedy for earning over  Billion dollars? No theyre incredibly business savvy and made a game that millions upon tens of millions of people have and still do enjoy every day. You want to see greed? Designing games specifically to sponge money from people with addictive personalities the industry calls them Whales who will dump hundreds thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars into their money trap games. Let me tell you something. I DESPISE free to play games. Most introduce artificial barriers that are fixed by their cash shops see labor pots locked chests with cash shop keys epic gear licenses etc or flat out either sell the very best gear in the shop or make getting the gear incredibly hard and frustrating and sell shortcuts or ways to guarantee the best loot see Neverwinter selling items that make sure your trade skill combines are  guaranteed not to fail. I think it was last week somebody posted an eye opening statistic regarding FP games... Annual retention is  on average. Thats fucking terrible. But I can see it. People go in drop a few or many bucks realize theyre just getting nickel and dimed for everything and leave once they get tired of it.Back to WoW. The game has delivered a consistent high quality product for over  years now.  It may not have been the first with many innovations at launch but its iterations on other game systems were amazingly well done. An easy questing system that you could play solo all the way to max level? A death system that didnt punish you? A seamless world with almost no loading screens? A stylized art design that didnt look like shit after a couple years? See EQ which went for realism over cartoony and now looks awful  years later a game world dripping with lore that was fun to explore? A game that ran well even on mid to low range systems in ?  I could go on. All of these combined to make the  MMO of all time. We get it you dont like WoW... But dont poopoo the concepts that make the game great just because you dont like them. As Ive said to others who just can seem to accept WoW or think it sucks  million people disagree with you and are playing and enjoying the game. ,MMORPG,cou3rzp,1,t5_2qlxw

3236264,0,t3_2x59wy,My biggest problem is still the way they handled the APAC servers. Let me give you a breakdown of what happened.  Game releases and Bioware takes note of a large amount of APAC players playing the game. Lots of interest in APAC servers mentioned on the forums. Bioware announces APAC servers coming in March .  servers  PvP  PvE  RP.  Bioware announces we wont be able to transfer our existing characters immediately. Some people dont mind and start new characters on the APAC servers some keep playing on American servers until that option arrives.  A month and a half later the transfers are enabled basically a week or two after . launches start of April. . hits at the end of June and provides no new content just new system features group finder augments legacy perks.  Players start voicing low server population concerns due to no APAC advertising no new content for months and a single servers population spread across  servers. As server consolidations are happening for NA and EU servers APAC ask for the same but it is ignored. Guild Wars  releases and the end of August. Many players leave for that due to the massive content drought and promises of exciting new adventures there.  . releases in late September and we finally get new content in the game. Bioware finally acknowledge that APAC server population is an issue.  Bioware asks the APAC playerbase what they would like to see happen. The overwhelmingly largest answer is to have all  servers consolidated to one PvE server. MANY PvP and RP players agreed on this. The fact of Ping gt Server type was a large thing for the APAC players. This discussion takes place towards the end of . By February  there is still no answer. Many people have simply given up and the population was clearly suffering from it. Fleets are lucky to reach  population of a night compared to there always being  instance of  every night not long after the transfers were enabled. Towards the end of March Bioware announces that they have made a decision that will benefit the APAC players the most. It would be announced in a few days time. It is then announced that the best option for APAC players is to shut down the servers and ship them off back to NA and to go back to  ping. It was an absolute farce and has severely hurt the chances of new MMOs launching with APAC servers. Yes I know WoW has Australian servers now but games like Wildstar amp FFXIV likely never will. TLDR Bioware released servers people couldnt transfer to. They then didnt release content for months upon months and also didnt advertise these new servers. This led to old players leaving due to boredom with no new players to fill the gaps. ,MMORPG,coxg1sr,3,t5_2qlxw

But if youre going out and exploring youre going to hit high level mobs really fast and to continue exploring you need to grind hearts. Find a dynamic event? Thats just great! After  minutes its back to grinding hearts. Similar to skill point challenges theres not many of them and doing them will take a few minutes then you can grind hearts. Thats why they were added to the game after releases players had nothing to do! Thats the point. Exploring and vistas and POIs are all the exact same thing. You can list that as one thing so your list of things to do is basically dynamic events and exploring. ,MMORPG,cp5qdpi,0,t5_2qlxw

In real life there are examples of people who embezzled millions and got away with it legalwise too. But in real life they keep on living with that fact over their heads. They become that guy who embezzled millions which shapes their interactions with others for the rest of their lives.What happens in EVE after you pull out a crazy stunt like that? You transfer the money to your real character and then just delete the spy. Or if youre particularly greedy sell it as a trophycuriosity to some collector. No one can tell where you transfered the money so no one can track what you did to your real character. You steal the money you dont suffer for it in any way legally and you dont suffer for it in any way socially.EVE might be sandbox but as long as it has tools that let players avoid all responsibility for their actions its a very shallow sandbox full of dog shit.Choices and consequences are after all the foundation of any good RPG.,MMORPG,cpa1bxi,3,t5_2qlxw

3370204,0,t1_cpc5fvu,gt FFXIV areas are pretty tiny because the game was designed with the extreme constraints of the PS in mind. This is completely false for multiple reasons. Heavensward zones are massive in comparison and the PS is still supported just the same. FFXIV . designed with the PS in mind had humongous zones. Even Final Fantasy XI on the PS already had massive zones. The size of an individual zone can be made pretty much as large as one wants regardless of hardware but it comes with a certain consequence the larger the zone the more empty space and recycled assets there will be. The amount of unique details within the zone remains quite the same regardless of size. The difference between games like GW and FFXIV is that the GW zones contain a lot more empty space even if they hold just as many environmental details. You need to understand the context to realize why the SE devs opted for the particular design decision not hardware limitation in ARR. FFXIV . was criticized for having a lot of recycled assets and massive zones with a lot of empty space. With that in mind nobody should be surprised that in A Realm Reborn the dev team then decided to keep the amount of recycled assets at minimum while making the zones denser and full of details. Of course in the hindsight we can argue that going to the opposite extreme was not the perfect design decision to make but nevertheless it makes perfect sense that the devs did what they did. Obviously the Heavensward approach makes perfect sense too considering the criticism ARR zones received and it seems the dev team is closer to finding the perfect balance between object density and the size of the zones this time.TLDR The PS has nothing to do with the way the ARR zones are designed.,MMORPG,cpcff2m,1,t5_2qlxw

3393451,0,t1_cpekemg,Its a Catch. The game needs more players but people arent going to flock to a dead game that is unlikely to experience a sudden resurgence. I subbed a couple weeks ago to check it out and only lasted a few days before I said fuck it. The world feels totally empty. Theres nobody talking in chat theres nobody to do the group quests with there are very few auctions on the AH and even in Novograd I see only like  max level players just sitting there afk. Theres very little incentive for a new player to jump into the game at this point. Its a real shame because Allods couldve been a great game if it had launched with a sub option from the getgo.

3475716,0,t3_302726,lol See this is the challenge devs face.  My list of Dream MMO is very different to yours Pgt  Full action combat agreegt  Full loot PvP on areas designated to that like Wilderness on runescape but still not instanced Beyond starting area the entire game should be SemiPerma or have semiperma like elements eg. ArcheAge with the pack system.gt  Pay to Playlol? I will not touch a game with a sub a BP model like GW where you can exchange gold for premium currency is the best.gt  No cash shop of any kind As I said above when implemented with  no PW like GW its fine.gt  Designated healer support tank and dps classes with ability to make hybrids I hate the trinity.  Think of something new P GWs no trinity is the best Ive seen but its still not perfect.  Make the bossesAI more tricky not just inflated hpstats.gt  Trion should not be involved in it at all months ago I would have called you crazy but after ArcheAge.... I agree.gt   man raidsFuck raids.  MMOs need group content sure but finding and coordinating  people shouldnt be whats hard.  Make  man raids just with very difficult and evolving challenges.gt  PvP gear and PvE gearI will not play a game that has PvP stats resilience in WoW was one of the worst changes imo.  You should not need multiple sets of gear.  Change the way the moves work in PvP if anything.gt  Atleast  classes Sure.  IMO there should be like  and they should all be somewhat niche.  Paper scissors rock gameplay is great when done right.  Most mmos balance PvP as a near grey blob style design for classes gt  Atleast  racesThe more the better.gt  Levelcap atleast  at launch Sure.  Never understand why MMOs choose ish to be the cap though round it to  gt  Crafting system that has some meaning in the game  agree.gt  No racialspassives no advantages on playing some race play what you wantNothing wrong with fluff racial abilities.  I get where your coming from though cough will of the forsaken coughgt  mega server like in GW Yep.  Best thing to happen to MMOsgt  Dynamic level adjustment like in GW but not upwards Yep .gt  No flying mounts Yep .gt  Mounts ArcheAge style where they exist in the world and you can name feed kill them ect.gt  Gliding like in Archeagefuck that game tho im still salty Gliding was awesome Dgt  Huge living world Basically ArcheAges world was great Dgt  Normal quests and dynamic events Same as GWs and your gold Dgt  Player own land Definitely but unfortunately there should be instanced apartments as well as open world housing.gt  Fairly complex class customization many different usable builds on same classes for different purposes No cookie cutter builds and your gold.  I must say the way you customize your class in WoW seems pretty good now havent played in years but Ive seen the talent tree and it looks pretty cool.gt  PvP arena and Battlegrounds Sure but for fun rather than progression basically like GW but with OWPvP as the main event Dgt  PvE heroic dungeons and raids More options is always good but I would prefer they just balance the raids lol.  They could make a time trial style raid with leader board for the really hardcore ect.gt  Double jump Why not Dgt  Strafe while jumping GW I guess not sure if youve played ESO but I actually like how you cant change your trajectory once youve jumped Sgt  Solo players can achieve as much as group ofc not soloing raids or shit like that.. This is a hard one.  I love soloing stuff too but grouping is very important in MMOs.  I think all content should be achievable in solo possibly even soloing raids maybe with like AI lore partners or something but the group content should be rewarded with the bestmost exclusing Mounts armor sets weapons fluff items dyes ect. all cosmetic and nonadvantageous of course.Obviously your not wrong in your wants for an MMO but this is the problem devs face.  I think MMOs need to pick their audience and make their game true to their audience eg. Not try and cater to EVERY person making no one group truly happy.Tldr  Some points I agree with others Im virtually the opposite.  Neither of us wrong in our beliefs and its the challenge devs face when making an MMORPG.Edit  Lots of formatting. LOL at the down votes.... How is my response not contributing to the discussion?

3492259,0,t1_cpqb54m,Ah yes very true. It was a little worrisome seeing no Trinity in this aspect. One of the big complaints on the forums is the spamming of Potions.                It could make battles longer which is nice. But might just turn out to be who runs out of potions first.              You could get the same idea with a Healer class but then the strategy will always be kill the healer first. So this idea of no healer could make for more interesting battles.

Even though the class stories are somewhat isolated its the only MMO Ive played recently that still has challenging PVE and makes grouping feel worth while.  The companion system allows people the ability to solo without having to easy mode PVE for everyone else.  The companion system also allows duos to accomplish quite a bit like  or  man instances or  if youre geared well.  You and your party members can also talk to quest givers together with a die roll for each dialogue option which in turn contributes to your social points.

3673719,0,t1_cqaybw3,This is a typical problem with these big guilds. You end up having many cliques of people. Mostly those that joined together and are just in the guild to tag along on content that required more than the  or  of them.This is why when I ran my guild a few years back I always had a private talk with each new member. I explained that I didnt tolerate cliques and that everyone had to get along. I gave them an ultimatum before they joined the guild. If youre not open to meeting new people and integrating then this isnt the guild for you. I let them know straight away and gave them the opportunity to pass on joining the guild. Its not for everyone and thats why I specifically lay down the rules from the getgo.We ran for a few years in multiple games SWTOR LoL Diablo etc. We worked out great and I weeded out people that didnt fit the type of member I wanted in my guild.After a few years people went their separate ways because of real life commitments. A lot of them were in the military and were given new assignments that they didnt have time to dedicate to gaming anymore. Some of them went off and got married and had kids.To this day I still communicate with a few of them and get together for a few gaming sessions here and there.In the end it may have seemed like a strict way to run a guild but it worked. I organized events maintained our voice comms and had officers in the guild with which I convened once a week to see how the guild was running and any issues that needed to be taken care of.If you have a shit leader youre going to have a shit guild. Simple as that. You may have just had bad luck in finding the RIGHT guild for you. Every guild has its pros and cons. Your sample size was a bit small only .

3743649,0,t1_cqizdo9,I have minimal experience in both but they seem to have the same quest model. You have a story quest that traverses an entire zone and as you follow the story quest you find new quest hubs along the way. Its a painfully obvious model in TERA while in ESO they disguise it more but its basically the same. Instead of arriving into a camp like in TERA and seeing a bunch of !s around your quest turn in youll be running along the road to your next location and see someone off the road to the distance just enough so it feels as though you discovered them and are going out of your way to do their quest. However this theme is kept throughout the leveling experience which I dont think is necessarily bad. Tbh most MMOs do this but thats how the questtrail is laid out.As for the content of the quests ESO feels a lot less grindy than TERA. TERAs quests are almost exclusively Kill X of these Gather X of these or Slay X and bring me their head. Theres not much variety content wise. ESO on the other hand never has a Kill  wolves quest. Quest givers will have their town overrun by monsters and ask you to rescue trapped villagers who happen to be surrounded by monsters. Or you might just need to get to the end of tunnel but monsters block your way. You never feel like your just grinding away monsters which I enjoy.If you can afford it Id definitely recommend ESO over TERA. TERAs an option though if you just want to hop right in and try it since ESO has no freetrial.,MMORPG,cqj01h3,1,t5_2qlxw

4094121,0,t1_crmg1y6,FFXIV. Above all else for an introductory MMO thats meant not as a temporary fix before something else comes along FFXIV is the best out there.It has a very standard but comprehensive list of features from an array of crafting professions to dungeons raids PvP arena PvP battlegrounds achievement hunting cosmetics guild drama and an ACTIVE Playerbase. It is one of the few MMOs that is genuinely stable and well performing on most PCs. The game has many quality of life features to make it not frustrating to start and keep playing especially if you grab the game from Steam. There is no need to worry about disconnecting or random crashes. Zone to zone it handles well from large scenic spaces bustling cities.Its a good benchmark for quality in terms of sound design and art direction. While there is almost no voice quests music and sound is generally excellent and immersive doesnt feel like a generic BGM pulled from somewhere. Art is crisp and lighting follows the dynamic daynight weather cycles well. Levelling progression is available in different forms each available in small chunks so you dont need to commit hours on end just to get something done. Although if you want to commit hours on end everyday there are enough variety of combat and noncombat activities to participate in for everyone.Combat its very standard WoW style combat down to the use of more advanced macro usage thats absent from almost every other MMO. This means it can be played like WoW where you can do simple tabtarget keyboard turning and take your time with picking abilities to use in combat. Or if you are a seasoned veteran use full set of mouseover casting macros and weave instants between short rotations on positional combat. You generally have about a  abilities by endgame you use for each class.FFXIV has one of the more robust player economies in MMOs owing to an active player base and lack of inflation from real money cash shop items you see in many MMOs. You dont have a huge dispairty between the rich and poor so things wont be completely out of anybodys reach.For a first MMO its what I recommend above WoW these days.,MMORPG,crmyeat,0,t5_2qlxw

4119793,0,t1_crptd4q,A few things really crippled the game at launchArcheum the primary resource required to craft any gear at all was very scarce. Like really fucking rare and the only way to get them without paying was from monster pouches which required labor to open and you had a fixed amount of labor per day. Alternatively you paid real money for archeum chests..which gave you exactly what its namesake is.So you had this system where you could sell store credits for gold in the form of a useable item called APEX. The way APEX worked was you used the item and youd have a cast bar appear. When you finished casting it youd gain the credits  the item would go on a s cooldown before disappearing from your inventory.Guess what happens if you change zones while the APEX is in cooldown? Yes it doesnt disappear and you can use it again. This went unnoticed for all of  months from launch by the time which damage had been done to the economy.Secondly the game was flooded with tradepack hackers and bots which made it so that a lot of the trade routes were completely fucked in terms of returns for legit players.I think the straw that broke the camels back for a lot of players though was when they released this cash shop consumable called rumbling archeum saplings.Now when I mentioned that trade routes were kinda killed by bots it meant players had to turn to alternatives to earn money. Fishing was one of those means to an income but it had a high barrier to entry. You could normally fish very inefficiently without any investment but to earn good money would require you to make a fishing boat. These required materials called Thunderstruck Trees which were a really really rare lt occurrence every time a tree changed growth stages. For some guilds this was a lucrative endeavor planting massive farms of trees and defending the farms from wouldbethieves. For the fishermen they needed  trees to make their boats which would allow them to fish for extended periods out in the water.So how does this rumbling archeum sapling fit in the puzzle? Well it was a cash shop plantable tree with a  hr growth time regular trees were at least  hours to  days and a  Regular trees were somewhere between .x  .x chance chance of turning into a thunderstruck tree.For all the guilds who worked so hard to make merchant ships and acquire land for staging grounds to transport lots of trade packs they got fucked by the train of bots travelling to and fro the ports that had turn ins. Then when they turned to working hard for their fishing boats Trion releases this cash shop grab item effectively fucking other guilds trying to earn a living too.But thats just from the economic side of things. Heres what else they didEquipment had many tiers and hoops you had to jump through to upgrade them. After tier  I believe you had a  chance of getting a piece that would be useable for the next upgrade. Later on that chance would be  because of the  different types of gear you could get when crafting.Needless to say crafting the two highest tiers were expensive and time consuming. That paired with the aforementioned archeum drought meant that..crafting was really gated particularly on the less active server clusters.In the Korean ArcheAge to let new players catch up some  year after release they implemented a set of turn ins which you could grind to get weapons equivalent to the second highest tier craftable gear. Now this is cool and all except..Trion in their genius capacity decided that it would be a fucking wise idea to implement this at launch for us.So whats fucked about this? Its fucked because the entire game including both factions on both continents had to farm a specific set of mobs in a very small zone where you can PK anyone at will except for the sporadic  hour peace periods.Also the weapons were meant to be catchup weapons which meant most peoples armors were not up to par to match the damage output the weapons were capable of because they decided to release this at launch.What was Hasla like for a month? People who got there early and managed to farm their weapons would defend their friends and easily destroy those trying to farm. Others who had no connections had to tough it out and wait for the  hr peace periods. The drop rates were abysmally low too. Like if you didnt have a group constantly grinding a good spawn spot in an already pathetically small crowded zone you can expect to farm for  hours or more.,MMORPG,crpvr63,13,t5_2qlxw

The game is still paywin because you have a few whales per server spending thousands of dollars to obtain gear that nobody realistically has a chance of getting.  However its not as bad because the easily obtained gear has gotten better. There are now  tiers of hasla dont do it not worth it and Obsidian weapons in Auroria which are basically the next best thing short of playing the crafting system lottery.  Balance wise the game has improved as well.  Archers are no longer the brainless machineguns they once were but remain competitive if you have brains.

The cost of this sort of system is that there are going to be whales who spend fortunes of real money to convert into game advantages.

4373888,0,t1_csihyh9,By unique do you mean graphics wise or stats wise? Gear in ESO is definitely a little weird because of the predetermined nature. What really sets apart the best gear from the rest is just set bonuses otherwise every piece is just part of a template.They released a few unique sets that are great things to aim for endgame goals. The monster helm sets and the master weapons from VDSA and PvP rewards. I wouldnt be surprised if they add more when the imperial city is released. Id love for them to add more stuff like that theyre a huge success in that game because it really drives a lot of the end game motivations.,MMORPG,csio8co,1,t5_2qlxw

Hell I was buying gold in the s in EverQuest just to stay ahead heh.I agree with a lot of what you said but think the largest issue is that in a game with crazy rng and having crafted items tradeable which are best in slot you create a culture of throwing money at the slot machine to get the best gear and that pisses people off.Most of us want high end raid gear thats no drop being best in slot not slot machine maybe it will blow up maybe it wont crap.,MMORPG,ct2t5hs,2,t5_2qlxw

4630931,0,t1_cte9fdc,gt Half Life  was in development what  years? And was there  years worth of game in it? No it was a perfectly standard  hour FPS the kind of you could shell out in  months back then.Well thats one opinion. But then again all of that cut content was stuff that was necessary to learn what worked and what didnt. Performing experiments and scrapping the ones that dont work out is a big part of iterative development. In the end the game is better for it. There are far too many games out there that could have benefited from this indeed a number of shovelware games feel like they just had no standard of quality whatsoever. We dont know how many games go through that process. How much is left in the cutting room floor before release? How many iterations did they go through before even announcing the game to the public? We just dont know unless someone gives us a look behind the scenes and theres far too many games where we never get such an opportunity. But most of this is irrelevant because I was referring largely to the years of waiting between the Korean release and the NAEU release in which case we can literally just pull up the patch notes for the Korean version to see exactly how much developments been done to the game. And that... is quite the task.Just like Aion we benefit from the game being subsidized by the players in China Korea Japan and Taiwan. We basically end up getting all of those updates without actually paying for the development ourselves because obviously players in other regions have already done so. Thats a huge boon for us. The wait only nets us a more complete game. That was my initial point in saying that. ,MMORPG,cteasb3,2,t5_2qlxw

The more people that are buying APEX to PW the cheapper APEX becomes because of more competition to sell APEX undercutting. The cheaper APEX is or more flooded the AH is the harder it is to actually PW. Most importantly the cheaper APEX is the easier it is for FP players to pay for their subscriptions with ingame gold.Again as long as Trion makes APEX the only viable way to PW the prices will stay low youll have to spend more to get less and FPs like myself will have an easier time to continue playing.I can make g current APEX cost  on a good day and pay for my months subscription. On the other end I just traded g for a guy who is spending  for me to play. I would never spend  on g in Archeage. g in Archeage is nothing these days.

Many had unknown rewards that only by community knowledge did anyone find out about it.FFXIs fame system for example. Had nobody ever told you or had you not figured it out through some very obscure NPC dialogue. You never would have known how to raise your fame to the required levels for certain quests like Ninjutsu scrolls.The point is there was mystery and surprise. It wasnt just go here get this reward with an indicator on where it is turned in.MMOs have become this open book of tasks to be done to progress and really try to avoid social interaction at all costs.

A lot of the dungeons in Heavensward do require coordination and some of the bosses have mechanics that simply cant be overgeared. You have to know the fight to beat it and the game does a good job a communicating why you failed usually with visual effects. The game does a good job of teaching you how to beat an encounter which I guess could be seen as being easier than WoW which sometimes has very opaque mechanics. I do agree that WoW rewards you more quickly and in greater quantity than FFXIV. FFXIV can be a little bit grindier than WoW has become. ,MMORPG,cts1xe0,1,t5_2qlxw

4754892,0,t3_3g0lzr,It depends really.The thing about balanced competition is that to have such a perfect situation you need both sides to be IDENTICAL at the start of the match. Think chess checkers or go. In all  of these games both sides are completely identical. The only difference is who starts first. This point of who starts first is like the class selection. Its the one difference that forces you to change your playstyle a bit.So given that what do you think is needed for truly balanced pvp? Equality. That would be arena gameplay where outside stats dont matter. Examples  BnS and GW.However the counterargument is that classes arent balanced. This is the main problem of MMOs. You got different classes and all have customization so finding the perfect balance is uber hard. Usually the best solution is to focus on very clear mechanics shared by all classes. BnS does this by giving every single class a .s block and  cc breaks. Easiest way to find such games is to just look for games with the highest esports pressence. Those tend to have the most balanced PvP otherwise they would not really have an esports scene. Main example in the west is GW atm.Other than that dont really know any. I only really delve into the PvP if the MMO has really good balancing and a high skillcap. If none are around  just go play MOBAs or fighting games.,MMORPG,cttwe7s,1,t5_2qlxw

There will always be the optimal build for everything sometimes it simply takes longer to actually find those build. Just imagine a simple pure dps class no fancy utility or stuff just raw dps. No matter how freely you can spec your skills and stats in terms of dps there will be the perfect rotation at some point. A rotation that takes cooldowns and damage values into account. This would end up being the main build. Even if you could go for a DoTbuild on the same character it would be either completely inferior because it lacks the raw damage and would need fights to take a lot longer to outscore the burst rotation or would be simply superior and be the main build instead.,MMORPG,cu5a5es,1,t5_2qlxw

Now obviously thats not because Trove itself is a better game Its because as a whole it is better and can offer more for the average player.The second issue is in my personal opinion Archeage should have been a PP game or strictly cosmetic items in shop.

5025770,0,t1_curpvqk,Amazing looking games are really expensive and the MMO market is really risky. Most publishers would rather bet on something that is closer to a game that wasis successful than to take a chance on something totally original. The issue is compounded by the fact that the customers have clearly stated with their wallets that they are really only interested in a certain style of MMO. This is why most games are similar to WoW the people have spoken by making it successful and the publishers dont want to take risks so they put out games similar to WoW. This doesnt mean that other games CANNOT be successful. Look at EVE Online. It makes CCP plenty of money but it will never have the kind of draw that other games do. It just doesnt appeal to the casual market the way the theme park MMOs do and the casual market is where its at. Its a numbers game.

5093143,0,t1_cuzwu3r,Actually sandbox MMOs cost less to develop than Themepark MMOs. the reason for this is themepark MMOs require huge budgets to create detailed zones quality quest stories with voice acting high quality scripted fights like raids etc.Sandbox MMOs on the other hand require much less. The underlying systems need to be coded and the base graphics are needed but the rest can be done procedurally or through the players. For example land can be automatically generated like in Minecraft. Players make up the story through their interactions rather than a scripted story through quests.A high quality sandbox MMO can be developed by a small team that can make the base assets the base programs and let the players do the rest. A high quality themepark MMO on the otherhand requires hundreds of developers to create each individual zone quest etc that players generally only go through once.EVE is the best example of an old Sandbox MMO unfortunately its complicated systems difficult barrier of entry and paywin status makes it a niche title rather than a mainstream one.

5141022,0,t1_cv50glb,Ive backed the game recently and played it for a good amount. I would say wait for the next big update which should be this one.Its fun in its current state but just doesnt have much longevity to it.You can craft quite a bunch of different things armour weapons food etc. You can collect resources like wood pelts ore. You can just go around and level by killing NPCs and more.But all of that only last for a while. There is no real goal to strive for at the moment if you arent really interested in getting the highest level which will only grant you more passive points and stat points. Another problem is that there arent that many players online at any point  players in one faction is already high. This makes the Pvp kind of lackluster except for big planned battles. From what I have heard most of the players are waiting for the next update especially the guild update to start playing again.The crafting involves a lot of resource collecting you get  woodtree and  wood is used up pretty quickly so it takes a long time to level up. That said crafting lower tier armour or weapons is pretty pointless because you can easily get stronger equipment from mobs if you know which ones to farm.There will also be a character wipe with the new update so you might only get to play your character for a week and have to start over again.The new update should give more things to strive for and hopefully fixes a bunch of bugs and problems with the game. So my advice wait till the next update take a look at it and then back it the game has incredible potential.,MMORPG,cv5oodg,3,t5_2qlxw

We spoke so much about wanting to play something other then WOW but we end up alienating a game that try to break away from WOW formula. I remember a quest in secret world where you need to clear an instance on really annoying creature called the akab.It a tough instance what player complain is that they made so you have to solo that instance. So we have criticism coming out saying how secret world is a forced solo game. The reality is that instance is teaching the player to stop using aoe builder in order to stop them from popping up all the egg. But ofcourse player never do any wrong.

5176418,0,t3_3lubfq,gtWould you guys enjoy and MMORPG without a leveling system ? By that i mean your LV is based on your items and equipment you have . For example There is different types of hard rate on mobs like  bronze easy silvernormal Legendary gold hard so like that sort of a thing. In short no. There are ways to do this that could be effective that I can think of but this is in general is a bad idea. Horizontal progression does exist and it could be explored. But making it PURELY about my gear kind of...cheapens...the experience? Part of the beauty  of a MMO is the feeling of an expanding toolkit. Unless somehow upgrading my gear expands my toolkit that whole massive element of MMORPGs would be missing.As far as the mob difficulty thing goes sure why not but how is that different from the usual Grey gt Green gt Yellow gt Red gt PurpleSkulletc. progression in so many MMOs?gtwhat do you think about not having a class ? Like you basically customize your character as you want too for example nothing like RogueAssassinWarrior you can get every single skill you want from special questsshopeven bossesSuper no. This leads to overly rewarding time versus skill in every single case. It also leads to literally everyone playing the same class. How do you balance that?

5287117,0,t3_3ndsod,NEVER AGAIN under the current market.RPGs are probably the most difficult game to create well. there are lots of writing elements art design combat and background math to make an RPG work correctly. Youve seen an RPG where the story was shit so it went to the wayside. The art design as awful so people never touched it. The combat was bad so people tossed it. The leveling balance or some other background math was bad you felt it and stopped playing.NETWORK code is notoriously difficult as well. If youre a student learning programming at college networking is probably a Jr. level course for an undergrad. The people who specialize in net code and are good at it are expensive.So you have two different types of money issues. Ive seen numbers that estimate an MMO can cost over  million dollars from lets make an MMO to We are releasing our MMO to the public.no one has  million sitting around on a pet project. WoW is the most successful MMO in history. It was beyond its peak when I saw reports of  million players active around the Cataclysm era. If you want a return of  million  upkeep costs you need a HUGE playerbase giving you money up front if  million people bought Cataclysm and it was sold at full retail  thats a  sale And you need to keep paying upkeep so you need consumers paying you regularly WoW is subscription base most other MMOs have a cash shop hoping to get the same out of you as a sub.The issue is that Blizzard lost sight of what an MMO could be and created a Skinner Box it continued to make money It probably made more money and now EVERY MMO that wants a return on investment follows the game that did well.So you will never see a unique MMO so long as RPGs are expensive to do well or as long as programming is a specialized career choice. If those two things change in the future then MMOs would become cheaper and experimentation can resume.,MMORPG,cvnhp6z,2,t5_2qlxw

Another game im going to add in here is BLACK DESERT have not played much of the game but the graphics are AMAZING you get to own your own home and pay for it love the details they have gives it a very medival feel with realistic anime feel havent had much gameplay but love it so far ,MMORPG,cvolvum,1,t5_2qlxw

Almost every MMO player has put up with thousands of boring repetitive and grindy questsAnother good point.  I think this model could reduce the need for typical quest hubs and make storyside quests more interesting and purposeful.

Theres literally ZERO innovation in that.Why you actually fall for the Well walking to a place is so much different than walking to an NPC! I have no idea. Its literally the EXACT SAME THING in a different packaging unless youre talking about the one of three dynamic events in a zone which are usually INCREDIBLY DULL completely disconnected events which carry literally no impact on the overarching narrative or the world around you there are exceptions to this before you try to raise the  events that dont fall into that category.And it isnt nearly as subjective as you think  people that like critically bad things as in bad when measured against an applied set of standards for the entire genre the item participates in say things like this.No it isnt really all that subjective. Theres no innovation in GWs narrative at all. Theres nothing unique about it. Its just another generic fantasy romp except instead of actually having to write dialogue ArenaNet stopped pretending they have capable writers and forewent it all together in favor of dynamic events.Which are still a shell of Public Quests in WAR and what Rifts used to be like in Rift. The funny thing is you reference FATES from FFXIV  these have literally NO narrative to them at all. They are just titled with puns and then go kill the monster. How is that different at ALL from generic questing except theres no readinglore involved and its not under the players control?You didnt even bother to read my post is the worst offense in all of this so maybe your problem IS actually literacy not to be mean but if you really hate reading that much GW is great for you. I wasnt really touching on the system I was referring to the fact GWs system specifically targets people that dont care about narrative or lore  its designed so that you dont have to bother with reading or understanding anything you literally just run into the heartorange circle Take your pick and follow the objectives that pop up on your screen.You trade out immersion for a game mechanic. For people that actually give a damn about lore thats a huge downgrade and amazingly boring.And saying things like I dont like scifi just expounds on your ignorance. Star Wars isnt a true scifi IP  its a FantasyScifi Space Western. Depending on your class it literally was a straight up fantasy game that has laser guns instead of arrows. It doesnt take away from the fact that it is one of the few if only participants in the genre that has deep rich character development and meaningful choices throughout the main quest line that actually matter at least for your personal storyline. ,MMORPG,cvu3621,0,t5_2qlxw

You couldnt kill the blockers get them sent to prison etc. All you could do is pay hope and hope they actually move. Riders escape has like a  minute cooldown so it wont work if they have to lines of blockade.Blockading would be an awesome mechanic if it happens in a pvp zone. But that isnt what people are doing. Theyre in PVE zones using their carts to block paths with no way of being killed.Trion is making the right move here. Theyve made a lot of shitty decisions such as server merges when there were still short queues during peak times on many servers and no land archeum trees making Rift Pw etc. But this was right.,MMORPG,cw8pgqy,3,t5_2qlxw

5537206,0,t3_3qpfvi,This is the best free to play game I have ever played content wise. Ive been playing MMORPGs since they came out and online gaming long before that. Players have no restrictions to content and you absolutely do not need to have pay gear or ships to be successful. The one thing you might want to purchase is the increase to the size of your bank account to raise it above  million. It sucks to sell some cool thing you find and realize you lost money because you have that limit.I have purchased exactly two ships from the game store over a five plus year period. Those were purchased via in game currency that I earned in game. One of those ships was purchased because it went well with my character. Its by far not a very special ship. The other one I did purchase because of its stats but also because at the time it was the top level ship for that faction. No regrets. Its still a bad ass ship.This is not Eve Online. The learning curve for Star Trek Online is quite small compared to that game. STO will have you doing things within a few minutes that would take you a week to do in Eve.  The space combat is lots of fun and you never feel inadequate.Two downsides. As mentioned previously the grind like in any MMO is present in this game but you do not need to grind to enjoy the game. I probably grind maybe  of the time compared to the average player. I generally only do it when they offer events that include a ship as a prize at the end. Ships that are the very top tier ships in the game.The second downside is the minmaxers  munchkins. You can end up in some missions with people who will seem like gods compared to you. But its okay because your all on the same side. So you are not going against them. Its uncommon to run into a situation where you feel weak but it can happen. I feel that is the nature of a game that has been around for five years. The devs are desperate to attract new players to aging games but also create a lot of content for the veteran players who know the system in and out. You will recognize those players by the constant spewing of acronyms. For the vast majority of these players you meet you will have a very good experience. They are great people and will explain things that you do not understand if you just ask. You to may become a minmaxer. I have recently dipped my toe into that pond and was very pleased to increase the power of my main ship to a decent level with the help of a fellow player and about an hours worth of work from me. The devs on STO are likely the best I have ever run into. They frequent the rsto subreddit and the in game reddit chat. They are generally really cool and treat the rsto community as a true community for the game. Many other game developers would completely ignore an uncontrolled outside community. These guys do not. One other downside to the game might be an incoming players preconceived notions of what the game will allow them to do in regards to playing a certain species or flying a ship named Enterprise. The game has restrictions due to its smallish player base which is quite sizable for a five year old game. For instance you can not choose Cardassian as a race when creating a character. The game does allow you to create a generic alien character that you can make to look like a Cardassian.  If the game had a much larger player base they could create more factions. But as it is the other two non Federation factions are smaller than the Starfleet one. Though its barely noticeable in game. It would be nice if you could create a Cardassian faction character but the realities of online gaming populations prohibit that at this point. Likewise you may run into a few name restrictions for ships. The big one is that you can not name your ship Enterprise. No big deal. Another funny one I found is that you can not name your ship Hit I assume because when it as the ships faction initials in front of it it would look like this U.S.S. Hit or I.K.S. Hit US SHit. Hardly a game stopper.If your a twelve year old gamer who likes to insult my mother and cast doubts upon my sexuality then this is not a game for you. Stay on those consoles please. ,MMORPG,cwjfdoz,4,t5_2qlxw

5589774,0,t1_cwp6w3o,totally agree with this comment. Issues abound with this game. Unbalanced mob damage funky looking tab targeting with a useless dodge mechanic poor optimization very grindy to unlock your classes.Small issues I had were things like the tank classes not being very tank like. Tanking relys on CD abilities to absorb and mitigate damage not as much on having higher defenses and health. DPS classes vary a lot though. But I had issues with some of the ranged dps classes not being able to avoid a mobs melee basic attack. Very poor kiting abilities as well. Very poor stat allocation. If you level you character incorrectly you will get placed into tougher instances than you can actually do. The system is designed to focus on one class at a time and then move on. But if you level multiple classes your over all level still increases. The game will then queue you for higher level instances that you cannot perform in with so many low level classes.,MMORPG,cwpypj9,1,t5_2qlxw

5604066,0,t3_3rri90,Skill based contents wont have botting because it wont help you unless they are skill related i.e. aimbots in FPS games but they are not the conventional bots that we often refer to. Numbers based contents encourage botting i.e. getting gold getting exp getting extremely rare loot. You cant really compare the two since they represent different style of game play and favored by different subsets of the gamers population.If you want an example of MMORPG with no bots only GW comes to mind and I have no idea how they do it. Even WoW which requires monthly subscription cannot stop bots but somehow GW a buy to play game is able to have no bots. I am really not too sure how they do it since gold is extremely essential in that game. ,MMORPG,cwrqlbc,1,t5_2qlxw

5622613,0,t3_3s32kf,I dont really know for WoW as I was not in it at start but I played FFXI as first MMO then Lineage  and in these  games the social aspect was really important. In FFXI outside of parties you had almost no single player content so you were speaking a lot about the weather with your linkshell. Same with your group during pull or while resting after big fights as there were no real strategies just focus and dont pull  gobs we were free to speak about anything else. In Lineage  parties were long grind fest without any use of our brain activity assist  hours long as a DD so we spent our time talking. And there were wars and politics and rumors and treason that you cant find in a rigid faction game. So you were talking about IRL things or about how X slept with Y at the last IRL meeting or about the recent war with Z. After that I tested A LOT of MMOs never did I find again that feeling I was living a second life and not playing a multiplayer game.What I see is greatly involved in that lost of community aspect   Daily quest that are almost always solo easy garbage content Faction wide automatic events you dont even have to move your ass you are auto invited ... seriously ... Group finder No real content for clan your clan should be your family Battleground and other arenas that are mainly either solo or pick up yes in WoW you have a decent pvp with arenas but thats all Very important  the feeling you are accomplishing something with your clan friends not alone you are no hero ! Ex  Promivion in FFXI at launch Valakas or Antharas  getting a castle in L Very important  you have to actually work hard to get something.There must be other things but I dont find them right now Today there are good in fact very good multiplayer games but no more MMOs as I define them.

Someone driving on a road doesnt prevent other people from driving on that particular road.So someone playing a game doesnt prevent someone else from playing that particular game because there is a potentially infinite amount of copies of it available. because thats how data works.Ill give you the technical explanation here If the marginal cost of a product the amount of cost associated with providing an additional consumer with said product is zero it is a nonsubtractable nonrivalrous product. all electronic media consumption falls into this category.Bandwidth is not related to the game its a different good entirely.

5690559,0,t3_3t25wt,Its under the radar right now because theyre gearing their attraction towards backers testers and closewatching fans. Theyre gonna start widening that focus when theyre ready to show off an actual game because right now its still in heavy development far from what well see in beta. Right now the testers are under NDA and cant really share their experiences thus far.In my opinion this is a good move from City State Entertainment. In a sea of crowdfundedearly access indie MMOs theyre one of the only teams shielding the games early stages so it doesnt taint public opinion. However they do release constant transparent developmental updates so outsiders know what stage the game is in and what things to expect when it gets to a playable state.Also the game is being developed for a very specific niche with expectations for a low population compared to MMO giants. Its very specialized for a certain group of gamers and its expected that those people will have sought and found out about the game just as you have.However I do think more people should know it exists. I guess thats partially our job though as fans of a new indie team. We gotta help spread the word ourselves to really get the community growing.Edit Also clarification the Beta is coming this winter but not necessarily in .

They are well aware that adding in a half assed PvE side to the game wont attract anyone away from WoW or Final Fantasy XIV.They dont expect to get rich just run their game for those interested in that style of game similar to Eve Online.

Two solutions out of this make it totally free and pay for the hosting and maintenance from my pocket or to make it buy to play which effectively binds with a contract with the purchaser to keep the servers up or risk sullying my name.

GW  is a FT not FP they restrict you to the ground and you have no access to the strongest elite skills sets from the expansion and on top of that you cannot even do meaningful trades or ask simple questions from world chat. These problems seem negligible when you first play the game but eventually you realize without the ability to buy most things from the market you are pretty much playing a single player game in a MMO world. You will still be able to enjoy the beginning but eventually you wont be able to bear to stay FP. Buy or leave it.

5846570,0,t1_cxlzxq8,One significant part of WoWs success was the ability to take things that worked and simplify them for the masses.The most significant part of WoWs success was CHOICE. WoW was most successful during WotLK. It was during WotLK that you the player had the most choice with what to do with your time.If you enjoyed raiding there were plenty of raids for you to do. If you enjoyed PvPing you had several choices you could participate in. If you liked neither of those two things you still had daily faction grinds heroics and the grind for heirlooms. Thats right welfare epics are what helped make the game.With each expansion after WotLK Blizzard kept removing things for the casual player to do. Thus WoW has seen a decline in the player base. In Cata they changed how faction grinding worked. With MoP they stopped creating  man content and actually said there would be no more. In WoD all there is for casual players to do is sit in the garrison. Leveling alts has become a pain because all these alts have to look forward to is more sitting in the garrison.If they do not give players back the ability to progress in the manner of their choosing Legion will not save WoW.,MMORPG,cxm0hps,0,t5_2qlxw

This gave people a chance to get to know each other and become friends.  Of course the wait could get a bit ridiculous at times but over the years MMOs went way past the point of balance that could have allowed the players to interact with each other while enjoying the thrill of the combat.

5988197,0,t3_3xelzp,Because all FFA PvP fantasy MMORPGs have a crippling problem that Eve solved in a way that is virtually impossible to replicate in a fantasy game. And that is new players being useless. In fantasy games if you dont have gear you get shit on. Period. In Eve they solved it with a combination of ship sizes and economy. As a new player you get a small fast ship that is difficult if not impossible for bigger more powerful ships to even hit. Sure players with more time and money can get other better faster small ships but many players are unwilling to risk them in PvP because of their cost. Even complete newbies can be effective in PvP with the right FC. I know because a few years ago when I played Eve I got in on some lowsec PvP action my very first week ever playing and got a kill and far more isk worth of damage caused than received.This is all crucial because if new players dont stand a chance the game will inevitably die as it bleeds veterans who quit for whatever various reasons and no new players stick around to replace them. ,MMORPG,cy4l166,3,t5_2qlxw

6002349,0,t1_cy6e5nn,Before HoT people were running two kinds of dungeons regular dungeons and fractal dungeons. With HoT Anet nerfed dungeon rewards into the ground so that regular dungeons are more or less dead. Fractal dungeons are now the new focus for man instanced content. Here too Anet somewhat messed up the loot table but they addressed this in a recent patch.The main thing in HoT PvE are undeniably raids. They are somewhat challenging and will remain so for the foreseeable future. The guild I am a part of recently killed the first boss with  people instead of the  that are intended. This means that for hardcore players raids are almost on a farmable level but getting to that level requires a lot of time and dedication. All Im saying is if you ever did Ornstein amp Smough melee in a SL run nothing in GW nothing in any MMO I guess? will feel truly challenging.Bottomline PvE endgame consists of fractal dungeons and raids. For new players itll take quite a while to tackle both considering you will probably want to do the personal story first and maybe participate in some seasonal events along the way. For fractals theres also a bit of a gear grind.Some info about myself so you have some context I spent  hours in this game. It was pretty much my life for . years.

6209699,0,t1_cyuvt5c,Just to add to this. Havent played ESO endgame other than solo stuff but can tell you whats there  vet dungeons trials  player raids but I believe they are VR  and the current cap is VR  so you will eventually out level these Im assuming theyll release new ones eventually and of course the adventure zones which is also group content along with the ability to single player level through the opposite faction zones. And of course theres the OwPvPsiege PvP zone which is a big part of endgame as well. Crafting is big since all the best gear comes from that so youll prob do that as well. FFXIV while it has a lot of dungeons you will be doing the same few over and over and that gets boring fast no matter what. Then youll move on to the one raid they have. Both dungeons and raids are well designed but the fun is short lived due to the limited and repetitive content. Its also rather easy to get gear so youll be done with it fast and then either you do the same on an another class or take a break until the next expansion. Although I suppose its a good game for a casual player to progress through the content at their own pace and not feel left behind.. ESO has Dark Anchors throughout every zone. Theyre like smaller rift type events. You get several waves of mobs and then a boss at the end. Not as huge as some other games but theyre a fun extra thing to do.. ESO is action combat  active dodge active block animation locking and canceling etc. Assisted aim but its not a big deal. It does have two weapons you swap between although the ability bar is small. Lots of character customization.. In FFXIV you want to earn dungeon armor and then move on to raid armor. ESO the best stuff is mostly crafted.Agree on the Pros but you skipped the cons so Ill take care of thatFFXIV Bad PVPnot much more to say here its a PvE game and PvP is not even a thought in their mind. Its a themepark so you get everything that comes with that which also means you will burn through the content quickly and get bored of it needing to take a break and move on. You can only enjoy this game for  months or so at a time.ESO Personally I wish they had nameplates it makes everyone and everything easier to identify and really makes a game feel more alive to me and it also makes a game feel less solo oriented. Also the hotbar is a bit too short for my taste and even though with two hotbars you do have  skills which is a good number along with the dodge block light attack and heavy attack it sometimes leaves me wanting more. I wish they had more PVP than just a siege zone and I havent played it in a while but supposedly its laggy now but I dont remember lag issues when I played it. I wish faction zones werent limited to just the faction  it would be better if it felt like a standard MMORPG in that theres just one world and all factions exist in the same instance of  a zone. Lack of global AH was a minor issue for me until I discovered there are a lot of guild stores you can use. ,MMORPG,cyvh51a,2,t5_2qlxw
6211176,0,t3_40n8dw,In Guild Wars  I used to play Ranger and the beast master abilities were pretty dang good.I used to play Random Arenas a lot as Ranger  Paragon and I would sick my pet after mostly casters. I had all pet commands on my bar and I had a pet attack that would do more damage the more pet abilities I had on cooldown.One of my abilities made it so that my pet was unblockable. So I would use the unblockable ability then use the takedown Knocks the enemy down ability then use this other ability that Dazes makes it so the enemy spell casting is easily interrupted just by being attacked and doubles the cast time the enemy when knocked down. It must have been so frustrating having this happen. The DPS from the ability that did more damage the more cooldowns was pretty dang good too. You could spam it and just do a ton of damage.I would put just enough skill points in spear so as to get maximum damage then throw the rest of my points into beast mastery. I chose spear as my main weapon because it was faster than the bow on average which meant more interrupts when I hit someone dazed.I had an amazing time with that class.,MMORPG,cyvn6p7,1,t5_2qlxw

I think LOTRO did this to great effect and lately FF.  I think ESOs sound design on weather was fantastic for this as well.That said having it effect gameplay can be cool  but also annoying.  Lower visibility is one thing  while FF doesnt reduce visibility at night it does with the fog weather effect.  I do think that lowered visibility is cool and not bad to use  we could even use lanterns or something.  I remember in Mines of Moria in LOTRO you have a little glow around you in darker areas implying you have a lantern on you.  But low visibility isnt annoying like say reduced movement  which is cool and flavorful but also annoying.

I dont even mention stuuf like that they was much bigger and more complicated to navigate Sunken Temple ws great barrier for braindead players that nowadays can conquer raids and dungeons in Azeroth with LFR and pulling  mobs groups at once.And yes i raided AhnQirai or whatever this one was spelled and Naxxaramas in whites and greens...sure... rofl.And no.. we dont wipe  times with good gear on first boss in BWL because fight was so intense mechanically and there was big challenge to manage  person raids when basically everyone must do everything perfectly... and then after me mastered the fight we wipe even more times on Vael because fight was even harder... and go on.And dont even get me started about fights like Nefarian Cthun or Kealthas...overall... you are completely wrong and you dont know what you talking about. ,MMORPG,cyyo52d,1,t5_2qlxw

Why should we make bosses so predictable and measurable in terms of DPS?ampnbspLet me bring up Wizardry Online as my favorite example love that game!  and look at different ways people could defeat bosses.  In a normal WoWlike MMO now days once you engage thats it.  However in Wizardry Online with enough time effort patience it is actually possible a Thief could defeat a boss by merely disappearing from the boss and dropping aggro hiding behind a pillar and staying out of LoS when not in stealth so they boss doesnt see them then setting up traps and preparing another onslaught before disappearing and dodging the bosses line of sight again.ampnbspBy the same token a Priest could defeat bosses through sheer amount of healing and whittling most bosses.ampnbspMages were a lot harder due to lack of healing but they were the DD class to go to.ampnbspFighters were... OP in early content.  They could almost literally face tank with skill.  It had a block mechanic and your shield had recharging health so you could plan your blocks cleverly.ampnbspSo the fact that DPS and DD and enrage timers keep forcing people to have more or bring adequate DPS which the arbitrary limits started to force imposed restrictions on competitions.  Blizzards comment of bring the player not the class only works when ever class can perform the same enough roles... thats homogeneity and dull.ampnbspFFXI had it the best.  A red mage could solo bosses if they were geared clever and careful enough in their actions and behaviors.  Is that balanced?  No.  But its not a bad thing at all.ampnbspSorry for rambling. ,MMORPG,czftnv9,2,t5_2qlxw

Just like every other special snowflake player out there.ampnbspWhat happened to characters being unique and special because how they created them their unique take on the class and how they operated their offthewallcrazy build ideas that actually worked or served a niche no one else could being famous because you actually did something rather than the game trying to tell you how popular good awesome famous you are because some programmer and storyboard writer decided to type some code to be told to hundreds of thousands of players?ampnbspWhat happened to making a world and letting us players really have the say in it?  I also find it weird that games that are worlds that players do things in such as Mortal Online as an example are SO FAR in the other direction of what I am talking about as to be just as bad.  If something like WoW is the bog standard boring issue  balanced its not bare with me and Ragnarok Online is the gold standard of character and gear customization and lack of balance at ... something like Mortal Online is  due to how extreme it is.ampnbspOdd that I am against balance but believe we need a moderated approach to it. ,MMORPG,czgrrnt,1,t5_2qlxw

6458953,0,t3_441up4,Yeah. Tera isnt that good at immersion. It has great combat but doesnt have the world that is immersive enough to make you love the game which in my opinion is a huge potential wasted. There is no captivating stories and quests no NPC with a solid personality no dangerous world that has many curious items for you to explore and discover. Game is just a lot of different biomes with randomly placed foes for you to kill without any purpose outside fetch quest. The combat is really good. Like Dark Souls good. Every move you use has to make sense because you get locked with the animations. This isnt like other MMOs where you are fighting in roller skates meaning you can constant move your character regardless of what spells or skills you are using so your characters feet and your hands are not actually coordinating. In Tera every skill locks you in an animation so if the animation moves you have to move if it locks you on ground you have to stand there and take those hits like a man. ,MMORPG,czneddv,1,t5_2qlxw

They stated that they dont create original genres but try to polish them. That is what World of Warcraft was. They polished the MMO genre by removing a lot of mechanics that would have doomed Everquest and Ultima Online if they had millions of players.WoW was a calculated gamble but Blizzard was well aware of how fast the growth of the MMO genre was at the time.There was a lot wrong with Vanilla WoW.

6495344,0,t1_czr29fw,Similar. I started by thinking you choose your base class.  But at creation you get the choice to morph your path to any of the trinity  so for the sake of making it interesting  lets say Summoner. A summoner is traditionally a robed spell caster but with this system you can becomeName Conjuror Role Controllable pet dpsccSpecialization Elemental undead or demonic petsSummary Allies themself with planar and undead to do their bidding either through elemental mastery necromancy or demonology. Name Cabalist Role Short ranged and melee DPSSpecialization Elemental undead  or demonic dumbfire Summary Temporarily summons and Enslaves multiple uncontrollable swarm pets at a time to bolster their close range damage. Dismisses the summon harshly as it weakens. Name VesselRole Tank Specialization Elemental undead or demonic embodiment. Summary Summons the planar entities into themself adopting its powers and weaknesses. Become a Golem undead or demon to varying degrees. Name Harbinger Role HealerSpecialization Elemental undead  or demonic pacts. Summary Heals  protects  and controls through pacts made with their Summons announcing and praising their existence. This is just one example of one class. Ive tried to come up with melee and range dps for all. I really like the idea of each Specialization having its own strengths and weaknesses. And I like the idea of being able to say Undead Vessel LFG  or Elemental Conjuror looking for exp or Demonic Cabalist looking for Dungeon party Just a pipe dream  really. ,MMORPG,czr6083,1,t5_2qlxw

If you dont mind the themescene of the game and make it to end game there is supposed to be a lot to do and there is. Problem is getting a competent group of folks to do it with. In my experience the guilds arent as strong as they used to be. Youll have a full guild roster and only have a few people on at various levels at the same time. So when getting into Vet dungeons with a pug you might come across a great group but no one want to collaborate and be friends online to do more content together.

6641556,0,t1_d067u8m,Yeah Id say your memory is a bit hazy. The whole game was horizontal progression. Each new campaign added a lot of new content without increasing the level cap. Lots of new zones new skills new classes new bosses new armor and weapon skins etc. I dont remember ever having trouble finding groups for older content not that it would have mattered with the AI heroes that got introduced in Nightfall. There were dozens of different gear skins you could get for each class but it all had the same stats once they finalized the gear system in Nightfall. I had played about  hours and wasnt near to finishing everything I wanted to get done when my account got hacked and I lost everything and quit.I didnt say it was perfect but then no game ever is. And for horizontal progression nothing else has even come close. The best part was while there was some grinding that could be done most of the game was not grinding. Practically none of my  hours played was grinding. Thats the sheer amount of content the game had. It helped that it was trivially easy to level each class to cap and thus you could play through each campaigns story line with many classes without it getting too stale.,MMORPG,d06alzb,1,t5_2qlxw

6663984,0,t1_d08ja71,Ive been doing some thinking and maybe the linear progression of mmos has more to do with how we as humans function. Most people do things linearly in everyday life and I think this translates to video games. However weve seen games that break this mold not completely but a good bit and theyre usually met with acclaim. So I think the player base has to decide if they want meaningless linear progression that theyre used to or a more free horizontal progression that will shock their systems.

However one thing I would like to mention is that with the removal of the grandmaster program and the advertising for the membership plan I think that the game is going to try to move towards a steady income instead of spiking with grandmaster sales and issues. That right there is a very exciting thought.TSW is a very very exciting game that for the most part is very well done.

6684646,0,t1_d0ab779,The only way I can think of this being done is by just making a virtual world with lots of options for things people can do and letting them do almost everything.Once you start attempting to remotely make anything story related yourself for people everyone will experience it and thats what youre trying to avoid.You would need to let the players come up with darn near everything and run things themselves.Your goal is the world creator.  You dont write scripts or stories.  You just make the world and make things interesting in that world.  In the lowbie place where people are harvesting foxes for hides put a difficult to access cave that only opens randomly and have a troll in it that is insanely powerful who only comes out periodically.  It eats tons of things around and kills anyone who messes with it unless theyre extremely powerful and then it goes back to its cave.  Make when it comes out and when its there random and unpredictable.Suddenly people will have a story about the troll.  High level people may swing by periodically to see if theres a troll.  Lowbies will cry troll when it arrives and hopefully people will arrive in time.Make situations like this all over the world.  Make pits you can accidentally fall into that open up randomly that take you to an underground labyrinth of giant ants.  Make it so these pits spawn randomly and unpredictably and are hard to see.  Make it so players who are prepared rope and grapnel can climb out mages with levitate and float out skilled climbers can make a chance to scale the dirt walls but otherwise theyll be stuck wandering these tunnels and if they dont pack torches itll be very hard to see as well until they get out or die.Make it so food is a thing and there is no fast travel.  Make mounts easily obtainable but also nonpermanent.  Your horse can get mauled by giant scorpions and you can get poisoned and have to walk back to town while losing your food meter quickly due to poison.Implement a lot of systems and lots of content with no hint of story predefined.  Make things varied and randomized and rare.  Make it so there are things that people cant just go here and view for adventure.  Make caves that close off and have entrances open up nearby in different ways that require different mechanics to access such as bringing ladders to climb down into pits or allowing people with picks to chip through thinner walls into adjacent caves.Im rambling Ill stop now. pTLDR  You have to make a varied interesting world and let the players experience stories as they organically happen.  You cant force it.,MMORPG,d0ar1md,2,t5_2qlxw

6749540,0,t1_d0hetvn,Two things about the current state of Nostalrius that would likely not concern Blizzard very much  Nostalrius is gaining no economic benefit from having its server up so they are not directly taking profits away from Blizzard.  Some might argue that a very small part of the current WoW population might leave retail WoW for Nostalrius but Nost is not directly competing with Blizzard for PAID subscribers.  Nostalrius is technically not offering the exact same product that Blizzard is currently selling.  Blizzard is selling their latest expansion coupled with a revamped  experience and other previous expansions.  Nostalrius is offering again not selling or economically profiting from the vanilla WoW experience.  So again Blizzard does not see any DIRECT competition in the product it is currently trying to sell to its playerbase.A third reason would be that Nostalriuss active playerbase is such a small percentage of Blizzards current active subscriber base.  But this reason doesnt really have anything to do with the potential of a successful lawsuit by Blizzard.  Infringement is infringement whether its one person or one million.  Its the two reasons above that would be very favorable to Nostalriuss case if Blizzard wanted to take legal action.,MMORPG,d0hgjd4,4,t5_2qlxw

6761636,0,t1_d0ioq3e,Whats considered an active account though? The game doesnt require a subscription.

Like I said Im not saying the private server is dead. Far from it. But to convince a giant to invest into something like that with those numbers is a bit much.

6761939,0,t1_d0iqmr6,Yeah perhaps. I mean I can assure you that the big hats are watching nos and seeing how it does. With WoD they reached over  million subscribers. Since WoD till the Q report of last year I believe they had lost around . million subscribers. So that means they have a . million potential returning player rate. Now if these players wanted vanilla they would go play nos. However right now nos has only reached k with questionable statistics on how far the players are actually going. From the graph they put in it looks like a huge portion of the playerbase right now is still below level . If nos can reach  million active characters who are actually playing the game and reaching endgame I bet you there will be significant progress in the campaign for legacy servers. However if they stick around these smaller numbers there isnt going to be a huge incentive for them. ,MMORPG,d0iqs9k,2,t5_2qlxw

I think you misunderstood. And those two audiences are very different from one another.As to your idea that PvP players dont enjoy grind there are a lot of different types of PvP. Open world games with this type of PvP attract a specific type of player. They dont mind the grind because it fuels their PvP and when PvP is not happening they enjoy the relaxation of it while sitting in voice chat with guildies chatting about silly stuff.gtcasual sandboxy?

It doesnt have to be for everyone.

Some do things like weaken you or hurt you for a long duration great way to prankmess up another player while others have specific effects that can benefit you if youre in a bind such as a spell that turns you from a cow back into a human. Youre assuming the developer added these quirky systems just to be indie when in fact they add a significant amount of flavor to the game and in my opinion make the game quite charming. Not everything quirky is hipster. They arent offering the system just to  be pretentious but because they find it amusing and by extension think you will find it amusing. Thats a good reason to give that to players. They even said they were inspired by games like Everquest where some things are obscure and have to be discovered which keeps the game new and exciting. The animal forms are their own system as well theres a city dedicated to them that speaks animal language exclusively I think the city denizens attack you if youre nonanimal as well but Im not sure and they have their own unique fighting styles.

6944039,0,t3_4att1q,For me any time a menu replaces an inworld alternative I have a problem. Being able to flag yourself as looking for a group ala older FFXI and original WoW meeting stones  great! Sure it takes a bit longer to put together groups but at the end of the day I think its fun. Even having to travel to battlegrounds and getting into queue from a table is awesome because then you naturally bump into other players looking for the same experience. Groupraidpvp queuing where you can just click a few buttons and get into a group with zero communication? Not my thing. Ill put up with it in games I love FFXIV because thats the trend...but I wish it were different. Even then I prefer the manual party finder options in both FFXIVWoW these days because at least there is some degree of player interaction in that process. As far as travel I prefer ground mounts and playerbased teleportingshortcuts. Again FFXIVanilla WoW did it best for my personal preference. There was an option for fast teleporting around the world but that was gated behind another player or specific class. The worst at this today is probably Final Fantasy XIV. While theres great convenience in being able to instantly teleport to every zone in the game it really does shrink the world down to practically nothing. I think the absolute biggest issue for me is crossrealm anything...except maybe PVP. Anytime you are put in a position to meet other players that you may never see again its a huge immersion breaker for me. For me the better option would be megaservers that have all the players in one server vs. multiple smaller servers that allow players to hop back and forth. ,MMORPG,d13fqf8,4,t5_2qlxw

6975136,0,t3_4b8fst,Having played MMORPGs since the genres inception I sort of feel like the concept of build customization has been stunted for much longer than you seem to think. Most newage MMOs have suffered from illusory freedom in this category for at least a decade if not longer. Sure there could be plenty of different ways you could stat a class but in reality there are typically only one or two viable builds and playing any other way would set your character at a disadvantage. So in reality the choice is already made for you.One the one hand I would say that Black Desert shouldnt be compared to other western MMOs in this manner because its an eastern MMO that was created under completely different design conventions than what we expect here in the west. This one in particular is not uncommon in eastern MMO game design. However  when you consider the idea I mentioned above of viable builds which tends to be popular in western MMOs Black Desert is actually much closer than you may realize.Instead of using a talent point system Black Desert allows players to customize their build through the various armor sets and Skill Awakening system. These are the two primary systems that dictate the playstyle of any given class. For instance I could choose to go with Agerian armor and Bares accessories which is typically seen as supporting a more aggressive build. Or instead I could kit for Taritas armor and Talis accessories which is much more defensive in nature if I wanted to play a more tanky playstyle. Skill Awakenings are a little closer to talent point systems in that you can choose to awaken various skills to provide them with additional benefits but you cant awaken all of them so you want to choose the ones best suited to your style of play.Just like the newage MMOs that came before it Black Desert suffers from that familiar feeling of there being builds that are better than others. Even though Black Desert is an eastern MMO at heart this particular convention of build diversity is very much present in the game. Though its implemented in a different manner the core design philosophy is certainly there and perhaps even a little too close to its western counterparts in that regard. Black Desert is great in some areas and lacking in others but I dont think this is one of them if build customization is what youre after.Edit  I should clarify that I dont think its lacking in build customization when compared to western MMORPGs. In reality the entire genre has been lacking in this area for some time but what Im trying to say is that Black Desert is no worse than everything else we already have in that regard.,MMORPG,d16ywlf,10,t5_2qlxw

Not to mention this totally misses the pointComplaints about the  cash shop costumes range from  is too much for a costume to there are not enough costumes in the base game and the only way to look different is to buy from the cash shop.Adding more costumes to the cash shop doesnt address either of these complaints. They still cost too much and there are still too few options in the base game for a genre where cosmetics are arguably a core feature these days.gt Meanwhile most of you guys had no problems paying  a month for  years to play WoW.Youre assuming a whole bunch of things here. I never played WoW and not because Im too young or was too poor. I never saw value in the monthly subscription model because I knew my own gaming habits would mean several months of wasted sub time and a reluctance to pick up the game after a lull due to the  barrier for entry. Eventually I gave it a try with a couple different MMOs and ultimately found that I was correct in my initial assumptions.Youre also making a terrible comparison suggesting that being upset about a  costume is incompatible with being willing to pay a monthly subscription. A monthly sub done right gets you a lot of value for your money as it ought to replace the need for a cash shop convenience items and so on. Ultimately you should feel like youre not being nickel amp dimed when paying a subscription. The fact that companies abuse this is a big part of why the subscription model isnt very popular anymore. Meanwhile a  costume is still extremely poor value especially when you consider that it is character bound and requires a bunch of onetimeuse dyes from an RNG dye box before you can make it look the way you want it to. The two are entirely different.This is why logical fallacies are dangerous. Look how long my reply is to explain why his two line comment is incorrect.

7213031,0,t3_4e7yxs,I think Pantheon Rise of the Fallen is going to maybe have a decent combat system. From what it looks like they are going to have abilities for certain situations. Abilities will be stronger or weaker depending on target weather and other factors. As long as it isnt stale like  fire  ice  lighting type.I like if there are a lot of abilities if some are situational. There is a job in FFXIV ninja that has  types of combos.  set of combos are general rotation that debuffdotmore damage. nd set uses  symbols to allow for the use of  ability that can do a numb of things. I will admit at first it sucked having to learn all the combos and I didnt know how I was going to bind everything. Fortunately I was able to make macros for each combo cutting my key binds by around .Playing my ninja in FFXIV is probably the most fun I have had in a long time in an MMO. But I like everything to be very complex when it comes to gaming. There more complex a games mechanics are the better for me.

At first he says youre too needy and suggests that you find something to do to occupy your time so that you would presumably be less of a burden to him.  Then you find a fantastic hobby that you truly and genuinely enjoy and he finds that problematic because you spend too much time on it.  He doesnt seem like a very supportive boyfriend and from an outsiders perspective he seems selfish and selfabsorbed and I get the impression that he sort of views you as an accessory that should not be TOO overbearing but also should be available whenever he needs you to be. I would be very confused by the mixed signals that hes sent to you but if you feel that your relationship is important then open communication would be your best bet.

Most people didnt even know that Nost was just  server that had k people on during semi peak hours the PvE realm was capped at .k.Another thing most people didnt even know about was the next update that was coming within the next  months changing how the zones worked. With their change they could have a cluster system per zone so you could effectively have more people online in the World at one time with much less chance of lagcrashing and even if it did crash theres a much much higher chance of peoples data being saved and not rolled back.To be honest thats how the game should be instead of player capped once they change the resource spawns to dynamic based on population count it evenswill even out for raid mats and profession reagents.

7250406,0,t3_4eq15v,Also you can find another written summary of the siege stream here    Just in case heres copypaste Wednesday night was supposed to be the big night. Beta  announcement! Thats what many of us cried. Thats what many of us expected. Thats not what we were given. We expected at least an update on beta  and it was sort of delivered. We were told that we could not be given a very precise date for beta  because some people were out and they were still trying to fix a lot of bugs. City State Entertainment has been working hard as shown by their many livestreams on the game and so most of us understand and that makes it a bit easier to take. Fortunately they did have some interesting information to help us sit down and be patient.For updates on beta  they do have a ton of features going in and will have some initial Vox Magus art in. Players will also be able to craft ballista bolts. If all goes well alpha testers may be able to test the new features next week. They have also made a little progress on hiring new programmers.Siege Mechanics!Mark Jacobs dropped a ton of information on Camelot Unchained siege mechanics and you can say that I was more than a little interested. It certainly helped me forget my desire for a beta  launch date as I got to finally sink my teeth into his ideas for siege. This isnt necessarily parts of siege that will be in beta  but rather their intention to push siege into something a little more BSC.For making siege a truly awesome system rather than the usual mechanic that has players sitting there clicking on a button to repeatedly lob rocks at a building I think they are going to focus on three areas automation counterplay and realm differences.AutomationA lot of time was spent talking about defensive siege weapons. One issue that has repeatedly come up in regards to Camelot Unchained has to do with cube how you prevent night capping. People will spend tons of time building their own keeps and so players cant simply walk in and take them in an hour or in the middle of the night when no one is on. It seemed that MJ was suggesting that Camelot Unchained will have some sorts of automated defenses for these keeps. Specifically AI guards perhaps automated siege weapons and even shields. NPC guards have been mentioned numerous times and will undoubtedly be in the game but arent really enough. As everyone knows NPC guards in most PvP games usually end up being either really underpowered or really overpowered. It is very difficult to make them challenging and interesting. CSE hopes to find interesting ways to utilize guards and magic to provide this sort of passive defense that can still be interesting for PvPers. Having defensive siege might help as well since it can target enemy siege andor provide a strong defense against careless players.Of course the real feature that is likely to be controversial is the idea of shields. In this context Im assuming that shields refer to some sort of magical barrier that will prevent people for invading and claiming a keep. I suspect that only keeps of a certain size and power will have shields or that smaller ones will have weaker shields that take less time to disable. Shields probably serve two purposes. . To delay capture of a building and . To help forewarn the keeps owners of an attack. It may be that scouts are required to set off an attack alarm but I suspect that attacking a shield may do it  at least for the owners of that keep. This would give them a chance to mount a defense. This is something they addressed but Mark Jacobs said that they want to get player feedback on it. The shields in Camelot Unchained are also not intended to be a single solid bubble covering an entire keep. Instead it sounds like they will be broken into sections. Thus an attack on a keeps shield can focus on a single wedge of that shield in order to bring down just that segment. Alternatively attackers can focus on multiple locations to provide more avenues for attack.Shields and other automated defenses will not be unbeatable. There are definite limitations to those systems. First of all being that it is very difficult to design AI that can provide a real challenge to players  especially in a PvPfocused game. Second being that not every keep will be able to have the best of every type of defense. Players will have to choose what to specialize in with their keeps. Third being that the game will feature some sort of keep power. Each keep will I presume have some sort of energyresource that powers its automated systems. This resource can likely be cut off by sieging players to prevent defenders from simply turtling inside the keep.CounterplayCounterplay is also intended to be a big aspect of this. They dont just want people lobbing rocks at one another they want tactical planning and implementation. One area where this may play out is in power. It seemed to be suggested that players may be able to boost a keeps power with their own. This might be crafters with vox power or any player Im not sure. This could enable players to help repower shields while awaiting reinforcements and since shields are segmented players can choose where to focus that power. This might also apply to guards and automated defenses as well. They want reactives in the system as well as there to be an important element of choice.cube As mentioned players wont be able to have the best of everything in every keep. You will have to select which types of defenses you want. Different automated defenses will be stronger against different types of offensive siege. Thus you may select one type of defense and have your enemies adapt by bringing offensive siege that is stronger against those weapons. They intend to have LOTS of different types of medieval siege not just the standard catapult. Were talking ballista trebuchets siege towers siege ladders battering rams mangonels onagers perhaps even bombs.Thats right I said bombs. Magical bombs crafter made? were even mentioned as a means for bringing down keep walls and gaining access. This is in addition of course to players have some abilities that can weaken or destroy enemy walls. And siege ammunition can be crafted with many different features. Some may do more direct damage some may explode for AoE damage etc. In general most siege will be slow and not particularly good against individual players thank goodness for dodging! but that doesnt mean someone cant make a siege weapon specifically to kill people.Realm DifferencesOne final big consideration in making siege compelling is to have realm differences. The theme of Camelot Unchained is nonmirrored realms. This extends beyond simply the classes. Siege will also be somewhat nonmirrored. Obviously some things will work the same. A ladder is a ladder. A tower is a tower. But there may be some siege that are specialized to each realm and certainly in some cases each realm will not siege in the same fashion! The Tuatha combat style is totally different from the Vikings and we may see them employing very different siege strategies.There are other tidbits of siege information that Mark Jacobs released for us The deeper a building is within your realms territory and the longer it has been owned by your realm the longer it will take for an enemy to capture it. Thus players cannot easily backdoor less guarded keeps deep within your territory. Given how C.U.B.E. works crafters may be able to build ramps up keep walls. There will be caravans to pulltransport your siege engines. Once built siege engines are permanent until destroyed. Players can be launched over walls using siege.,MMORPG,d22bic2,1,t5_2qlxw

7403669,0,t3_4gpscl,Actually I did play it for a couple of weeks but the thing is that the questing is REALLY repetitive. All the quests involve entering a hub get about four our five quests they involve you in doing the following Kill X enemies with the number increasing as your level does  started from about  in the starting zone till it reached  in the  zone thats where it became unbearable for me Kill X enemies and gather X stuff from them the numbers also increase here Gather X stuff I dont remember if the quantity increased hereAt some point I stopped participating in Dungeons Battlegrounds and Class Arenas because the gear your earn from dungeons you can buy from the auction house and as long as you are in a guild and do questing you can earn more than  gold a day and with  gold at level  or something you can get yourself one of the best gear from the AH.The crafting is unbearably slow and expensive and as I said  you can get all the best gear from the AH provided the server is well populated and people sell gear that they cant wear on the AH and since it was well populated I could get the best gear from the AH without making an effort.The reason I quit was because of those reasons listed above the game is extremely easy if you played something like WoW before and other MMOs as well its really fast to level up and reach the end but there is one thing that really sucks  even though its fast and easy its fucking tedious as well. At some point I stopped reading the quest descriptions because at first I wanted to immerse myself as much as possible into the games world but it turns out the quest descriptions are as dumb as a raisin.I even managed to became the  Rogue in Arenas on the EU server. D Thats how easy the game is because I suck at PvP. DWhen I played the game I couldnt stop comparing it to WoW which Ive been playing since  I was really bothered that WoW had the same tedious quests but they somehow felt like a real adventure and in Vanilla it was really hard even with a BM Hunter. The WoWs world feels more alive or should I say Warcrafts world or The world of Warcraft ... eeeeh fuck it.I feel more inclined to go back to WoW and do the things Ive been doing for nine years than reaching the level cap  so far in ASTA. I couldnt even finish with level  and at least reach  thats how much I was frustrated with this game.The verdict The game isnt bad but if youve played games like WoW or basically have higher standards for MMOs dont expect to enjoy this game for more than a few days. I personally was very excited about the game because of the Oriental setting but after you leave the Asus starting zone Han District there is barely anything Oriental besides the buildings in the second zone . After that even the buildings arent Oriental. I dreamed of venturing through bamboo forests but there is only one tiny bamboo forest in the Han District and nothing else past this point. Even the gear doesnt look Oriental all the NPCs are but the players arent.For me the game was a huge letdown.,MMORPG,d2jqyi7,5,t5_2qlxw

These rules need to be implemented and controlled by a central place the server. BDO appears to let these rules be manipulated by the player the client.So anyone with a bit of Googlageforum snifting can identify how to hack their characters to have whatever they want and the server just believes it and relays that info to everyone else.Im a massive hater on hackers and cheats as are the majority I think. But it is the responsibility of the software architecture team to ensure they have done all they can due diligence to make hackingcheating as difficult as possible.Reads like that hasnt happened here.EDIT Tired as all hell so apologies if my lack of further reading makes the above redundant.

In a SAOlike VR you should be hable to use them all and right now we are just scratching the surface on how our brain compute immages this as well has been under research for mediacl use to give the sight to blind people you will need a huge databese and do not forget that each brain perceive reality in different ways so each VRhelmet should be designed on your brain.This TLDR part is just a compressed text of what I would have liked to say and to actually have a game like SAO you have to consider the creation of that huge world the AI involved the game engine in general that maybe is more amazing that VR itself...

Make it so the boss goes invulnerable for a while or until a certain task is done. Secret World had a mechanic in the first dungeon that made the boss go invulnerable for a while spawned a few adds and also patrolled the area looking for you and your party. If spotted you were immediately slowed and there was a HUGE change for lethal damage. You had to hid behind rocks and keep close to not get caught.

When you wrote a topic on the gw subreddit about trying to find a guild full of new players so you could run the dungeon instead of rush them wrong use of words by the way you got a few negative responses because what you asked for was simply said funny for any not just veteran but level  player aswell.I wasnt asked you dumbass I got allot of complaints over it.Your pathetic arrogant attitude could be seen by far when you were arguing with a veteran player about how low level dungeons are meant to be ran by low level players and that high level players have high level dungeons to run. Just to prove that you were and still are wrong...  When you finish a dungeon run you get specific dungeon tokens. Those tokens can be used to buy level  exotic armor and weapon pieces. Those tokens can also be used to buy Gifts which are used in legendary weapon crafting.You also get gold  gold that as a newbie you literally dont need as anything you buy is measured in copper and silver.I didnt argue about this someone cleared it up for me and I replied politely your the one whos attitude is pathetic because you nitpick and choose what to read in the first place and its still my group its my right to form a group how I please s can form their own.So exploration mode is actually meant more for level s than it is for low level players. And ANET designed it so this pretty much means that you wanted to play the game in a nondesigned way. Went into an argument with a random player probably more than one based on your attitude when they tried to reason with you while you were trying to prove something you literally didnt know shit about and now you are complaining about the community being over sensitive.  And you are trying to do the same with me.Im sorry to say this but you have issues.Ummm no you must be getting a whole another conversation confused.,MMORPG,d2ruwk1,0,t5_2qlxw

7493136,0,t3_4i0g6i,First I think this is very important to me preserving the original WoW experience is no different from preserving the likes of Pong or Asteroids. In addition I correlate this to books or movies where artistic integrity is maintained in its original format. While there ARE newer versions of movies like Psycho Birds or Citizen Kane the originals are still used to both teach cinematography as well as showcase some historical significance of these works utilizing techniques that had not become mainstream yet.I really would like to see games take a similar approach and while it has been true for single player games Pong Asteroids Frogger etc. multiplayer games add a whole new level of complexity to it. I hope what we start leaning towards is more of a museumcurated take on MMORPGs where dedicated individuals reconstruct the original to the best of their abilities to showcase the games with consent from the owners of the IP. Of course showcasing a game is a bit unique but think of more of a digital museum where you can fully explore each game.The problem of course is these works are quite young in age. This isnt a work of art that is  years old this is something that is still too young to even be considered an antique. But that doesnt mean the work has to wait! The work required to reconstruct these games is a huge undertaking and the community is vital to that. But as far as actually playing them lets not confuse preservation and showcasing that would ultimately be up to the owner of the IP. So potentially these games would have to be stored away until such a time they would be put on display in a digital MMORPG museum.,MMORPG,d2txged,1,t5_2qlxw

7531177,0,t1_d2xyc0j,Yep I have to agree.  FFXIV is probably my favorite MMO as far as combat content story dungeons.  I mean they do almost everything great until you get to raiding.  The casual LFR raids are too easy and the Savage modes are so stupidly difficult your grinding your face on the mobs boots until enough people get geared.   They really needed to do  things  They needed to add a middle difficulty and do something during the  man phase for raiders even if it is only  extra boss.   It would extend the life of it out quite a bit and let you feel like your actually progressing.  The problem is  bosses on  tier means you hardly ever see progression.   You do the first boss for a month the second boss for a month the rd boss for a month and the last boss for a month and then wait  months.   This was why wow has large tiers and multiple difficulties.  You really feel your progression every week.,MMORPG,d2y9ax4,4,t5_2qlxw
7531952,0,t1_d2ycbvl,gtOh theyll certainly merge servers and scale back content development dramatically probably recycle old content and rebalance it for new levels because thats just tweaking numbers. They havent merged servers yet despite the game having well below  million subscribers at this point.Theyve already scaled back content development dramatically. WoD had only  tiers of raids the fewest raid bosses of any expansion I believe and the longest content drought before the next expansion ever. The expansions are also the smallest theyve ever been.gtHowever Blizzard will never shut down World of Warcraft as long as they exist as a company.No they will shut it down. Sooner rather than later. Theyll want people to move to WoW . Blizzard isnt some special snowflake that never stops supporting games.gtThey made the decisions they could with the information they had at the time.Given the incredibly negative community reactions to the changes that have been very clearly the driver behind the massive reductions in subscribers Im going to have to disagree with your implication that they didnt have the information at the time given that the playerbase clearly did!gtSure is easy to look back and say gee someone should have contradicted Hitler. Not so easy to say when in the middle of a war.What a load of rubbish. Lots of people went against what their leaders said in other countries at the same time. gtYoure an armchair history general talking about how youd do a battle better since you know everything that they couldnt know at the time.You dont have to have hindsight to see that breaking an alliance with the Soviet Union was moronic.

Once you realize that youre essentially going to be doing these same combos killing at about the same speed wearing the same shit personal gripe lol with not that much incentive to group...well shit gets old fast. Yeah yeah you get some perks with more people and a better grind and all that but its totally optional and even then youre barely playing together  its more of just a group of people doing their single player stuff at the same time. Older games made group grinding a ton more interesting IMO.

The questing in the game is awfully boring and leveling consists of grinding FATEs random locations where infinite mobs spawn for a determined amount of time or doing levequests repeatable and extremely boring quests.  The world of FF is very fractured into small subsections with fairly long load screens even in cities. I also found the combat to be dull and slow in FF its all global cool down based.  ESO isnt perfect but its a good game especially if you like interesting quests story lore or a more action based combat system. You can play around a lot with your build in ESO as any class can be any role. I havent played Wildstar aside from in beta wasnt impressed but havent heard good things. Id definitely say go with ESO.

7733963,0,t3_4l8ql5,I dont agree at all there. Im going to use WoW as a comparison as I still think on the themepark front its king. FFXIV is a good game but I didnt see any socialization leveling from  twice in dungeons. They were as easy as WoW dungeons and probably easier if you dont level in WoW with heirloom gear.  Questing was even easier than WoW. I literally watched netflix while mindlessly circle strafing as an archer from  quest. There was  challenge there. Its something a lot of these themepark mmos are suffering from right now WoW too.  The rotations in FF are pretty basic compared to WoW. Im not sure what you meant by difficult or engaging. Rotations in all of these games are a snorefest. Both FF and WoW suffer from this.  I definitly think WoW has made them more fun over time for some classes especially when it comes to AOE. The global cooldown in FF saps fun right out of combat. It feels incredibly clunky after playing probably the best tab target smooth as butter system out there in WoW. Story is really up to you on preference. I thought it was pretty generic corny dialogue JRPG style with WoWs lore and world drawing me in much more just due to wc building it. Again that is personal preference. I couldnt stand the questingstory experience in FF though. I agree on crafting. FF has a good system there. Cant agree on graphics. They were again just generic JRPG for me. The invisible walls everywhere drove me nuts. If we want anime graphics I always thought Tera was by far more colorful and beautiful with better animations and much more ornate armor models. FF suffers from the brown and grainy treatment. Really this is all just up to the player though. If you are having a blast in FF then more power to you. Some of us just dont like it though. ,MMORPG,d3lap19,7,t5_2qlxw

Futhermore there are diminishing returns meaning that at later stage you invest much much more compared to what you get out of your upgrades. You dont even have to grind to level. All the relevant PvP is equalized anyway. And you will still find people for pretty much any content that you are doing at the moment. You dont even need to invest ridiculous ammounts of time to gear up. Doing your soulstone dailys and a dungeon now and then is enough.Its like a new guy comming into GW says i will never catchup to those guys with k ap.

7763934,0,t1_d3on6er,gtIs it pay to win?Kind of but not really in the way that you mean.While DDO is technically freetoplay most of the content is locked off to nonsubscribers so Id say that the free version is more of a very extensive demo than anything else. If you sub you get access to all of the games quests quests in DDO are more like what most games call dungeons and a monthly stipend of cash shop currency. As a result its functionally a subscription game if you want to play it seriously.Turbine does have an annoying habit of fixing various design problems by throwing the solution into the cash shop but the prices are usually pretty reasonable and your subscription will let you afford the handful of QoL stuff you might want.You technically could PW your way through dungeons by buying tons of healing potions and whatnot but I have literally never seen or heard of anyone doing that it just isnt really that kind of game.Frankly its kind of hard to describe the game adequately. It started development before WoW got big and it shows it is very much unlike any other MMO Ive ever played.For instance you dont regenerate health and mana while out of combat instead you can only recover them in between quests dungeons or at a rest shrine which a quest might have none or several of depending on its length. This means that if you trigger a trap or get hit by an enemy that damage will stick unless you chug a potion get a healer to burn some mana topping you off or otherwise use some kind of resource that wont recover automatically.This means that unlike most modern games theres no such thing as trash mobs and dungeons arent really broken up into discrete encounters. If you do a bad job at handling the enemies leading up to a tough encounter you have less resources.Now thats not to say that the game is without its flaws among other things you cant respec easily which means its very easy to brick your character if you make the wrong choices I strongly recommend that you grab a guide from the forums and follow it until youre much more familiar with the game but its still a very unique experience that I think every MMO player should at least try.Its a game that I keep coming back to.

If you arent looking for gear with modifiers for the skills you use you wont do much damage. If you do youll be fine especially if you are eating high level food which you can do from lvl . There IS a much higher learning curve on this game than your typical WoW style game but that is by design figuring out and finding the best gear for the build you want to use and expirementing is a large part of the charm for people who dont want a game that is just pick a class use this rotation and no challenge. BUT it really is not that hard to balance power as you are claiming unless you ignore the base mechanics of the game which is using power regen buffs and getting gear based on your build. Or maybe you were fighting above your level and didnt realize it.

The combat feels great and the dungeons are a ton of fun. I definitely enjoyed my time with the game. I did a lot of the gear grind at endgame too which was plenty fun with a guild in teamspeak.Regarding paywin you can buy all the max gear you want but its not needed for the PvE content and youre just bypassing the whole endgame.

Having the game up NOW is really important now that UW is dead.Again lack of transparency is a matter of what CAN we do. I think gamers are too focused on CHANGE EVERYTHING BALANCE EVERYTHING RAH RAH RAH... Its only a Eastern world thing if you look at Asian MMOs they dont change things that much they adapt and work hard even if things are imbalanced. ND seems to be destroying water combat city raiding which was the core of darkfall. You were NEVER safe even in your own city.UW was devastated as safe zones existed. This is a sandbox game YOU SHOULD NEVER FEEL SAFE. I am surrounded by  guys any one of them could stab me in the back and steal my stuff but thats the nature of the game.I played a merchant thats how I played the game and I had so much fun with it as such I had not much potential for killing people and running across the world in nothing but a fine robe meant I got killed.... A LOT.... but I wouldnt trade it for anything.Water combat was one part of the game I had a lot of fun with as I was part of many ship battles and falling into the water was one thing I did well. I sucked at bunnyhopping on land so I would drag it into water and fighting people in water was some of the best times I ever had.

It helps keep leveling zones more full because if youre a tank and decide you want to heal you have to actually reroll to a healing class.

8053701,0,t1_d4lah3n,gt but I dont know that offering a solo avenue is badI dont think I said that it was but Ill elaborate on this a bit to make sure my thoughts on the subject are clear. I dont have a problem with there being ways for players to log on and accomplish things while solo and in fact I think its healthier for the game that this is the case Im a tad worried about how the upcoming games with a no leaving town without a group philosophy are going to fare.In Star Wars Galaxies for example you could go out into the world and farm  and this entire farming process could be done solo. However this solo activity looped back into the games social systems when it came time to heal your wounds buff up if you so choose or simply sell your wares. The bulk of your play could be done solo but those solo systems still tied in with the games community which was awesome.Now if your argument is that you should never have to interact with another player ever and that game systems shouldnt tie into the games multiplayer community at all then thats crazy. This is an MMO. People with that position are like vegans going to steakhouses and complaining that their needs arent being satisfied despite them being  contrary to the entire point of the establishment theyre visiting. I dont play FPS games and then complain that I have to aim.There should absolutely be options for players to accomplish things on their own when they occasionally want to but if your position is that you should never have to participate in the games multiplayer community then you should be playing in another genre which isnt defined by being massively multiplayer. ,MMORPG,d4lb8oh,3,t5_2qlxw

Maybe even remove stat requirements and just keep level requirements. This have been suggested but core player base opposes this. I can understand why twinking is a unique to AO but itis a very unbalancing and mostly insanely time consuming feature PVP twinks will destroy nontwinks easily. AO is still propably top  MMO out there. World is rich. There is senses of exploration when you play there. Professions are unique and fun to play.

8072344,0,t3_4pr6nl,The one I could probably name as the worst happened when I wasnt there so I know little to nothing about the details. There is something that happened to me however that was sheer drama. In PSO the previous leader before how many leaders it had after that of Basilicom heard that my friends were guildless and looking for a new home. One of them in particular had several characters and he ran team orders with all of them daily which contributes thousands and thousands of team points necessary to enhance the team tree every week. This previous leader of Basilicom wanted me to pitch the team to them even though I wasnt even a member of it. My friends werent interested so they politely declined and went to what used to be another huge team on our ship Aomoris Circle. Basilicoms leader was pissed at me called me names and went on to ignore me. Not a week later she and her groupies left Basilicom to join Aomoris Circle you can guess why.

8226595,0,t1_d55q8k8,gtcompared to the encounters from earlier expansions the mechanics of later ones are much more complexconvoluted. also a lot of supposed difficulty relies on having everyone in the raid be on the same page. its not so much difficulty as was discussed in the OP but rather reliance on others to not fuck up a simple task. Convoluted is overstating it quite a bit. Its more accurate to say that many earlier encounters just had really boringbraindead mechanics especially in vanilla where the extent of a boss strat would sometimes be something like cleanse the debuff or he has adds.gtfirst of all i was trying to generalize typical situations where a raid can fail. the examples off the top of my head were dps racesenrages timers adds overwhelming raid and tanks being shotted due to bosses being overtuned. obviously there are much more complicated and nuanced mechanics than that but majority of mechanics in the game can be reduced to those.You can reduce them to those but only by ignoring a lot of intricacies that actually make them unique and engaging just like you can boil down every Dark Souls boss other than Bed of Chaos to hit the boss without getting hit yourself.Anything can sound simplistic and boring if you pretend that the nuances dont exist but its just that pretending. Its at most useful for explaining very basic concepts to people who arent familiar with the genre and fails to communicate any kind of meaningful information to anyone who doesnt need to learn the building blocks.gtlastly since im more oldschool wow in my experience world first guilds abused things that blizz often overlooked when they QAd encounters. iirc the very first gruul kill prenerf in the world was done by abusing flask of petrification to bypass the ground pound ability and that got hotfixed real fast. This is largely a thing of the past. Exploits tend to get patched very very quickly now and guilds are more consistently punished for taking advantage of bugs. For instance although this was a bug with the loot system rather than the encounters a lot of top guilds exploited LFR at the release of Dragon Soul to get extra loot and they received temporary bans for it.gtyes but i dont believe it to be actual difficulty that rests on the player himself. especially since the thread was about items that require difficulty to obtain which implies solo progression. i dont believe this kind of difficulty can be found in these kind of MMOsTeamwork and coordination are skills as well. Also I dont see how obtaining items means solo progression while a given item might go to a single player the means of obtaining that item can involve groups and usually does and thus the gear progression is linked to group progression.,MMORPG,d55vppd,1,t5_2qlxw
8226885,0,t1_d55uobr,gtNO THEY DIDNT!Im familiar with the changes you are discussing. It forced me to take a hard look at TSW. I didnt like what I saw.Funcom improved sustained damage such as for Raids at the expense of burst damage which is used everywhere else.gtSpecifically they nerfed a number of skills including the elite passive Gross Anatomy as well as Salt in the Wound Torture Elemental Force EF Fatal Flourish FF etc. They boosted other skills notably active elites of which you can use at most  largely by increasing damage and reducing cooldown time. That was done in a failed attempt to compensate for the nerfs to EFFF!I heavily disagree with the fact that burst DPS was nerfed. Before elite revamp my DPS for a  second fight in Polaris  averaged . After elite revamp I average . This a a DPS increase of . Most endgame DPS builds during that time did not utilize any of your listed skills except Elemental Force.gtEven when the elite skill was regularly utilized... Well take Red Mist for example A damage boost and the cooldown dropped from  seconds to  seconds. Thats great if youre in a raid with a long fight as you will get an extra shot per minute. Of course with the nerfs to EFFF its no longer an automatic crit amp pen shot. Even with the boost to damage you are now doing less damage per shot. So it will take you at least  seconds if not  or  seconds of fighting and someone taking incoming damage during that time before you break even on outgoing damage compared to how things were before this revamp. Sustained damage is up. Burst damage is down!That is true but that is not how a burst fights work. Builds with Elemental Force prepatch entailed one big damaging skill coupled with several other lower damaging skills. From what youve said you only focused on the one big damage skill. Red Mist before patch was not used by high end DPS players. In general Elemental Force consumers was about  of your DPS. That means  of your damage comes from other sources. When Funcom nerfed elemental force your personal damage was nerfed because you focused heavily on one skill however the general population and end game players did not experience the same thing. Funcoms addition of elite skill debuffs increased damage for weapons ranging from  to . Everyone else resulted in a DPS increase while you lost damage. gtThere are only  basic dungeons plus a couple more when you get far enough along the AEGIS grind. Each has  bosses in a fairly linear progression with game mechanics stand here rocks explode reflect shield etc that are only mildly interesting the first time through. Remember .. gear being  weeks of Dailys? Thats  dungeons a night perhaps  total. Youll play each of those  over  times perhaps slightly less if you unlock the couple of additional AEGIS ones. Its gets old fast and then you repeat the whole thing again to become a healer or tank.gtThen theres Augments and now the Museum. Grinds upon grinds.You focus heavily on the grind. The grind you mentioned is the time to reach maximum gear level without the need to do endgame raids. To be able to do content you do not need anything close to the maximum. A smart player with .. can match or surpass the damage of one with ... It will take around  bullions to reach .. without weapons. One dungeon can award  to  bullions depending on factors such as whether you have done it before or subscriber status. This means those gears can be attained in about a month by doing one to three dungeons everyday. There are other content to do such as scenarios pve missions pvp and raids. As for Augments they are not required for any content including Nightmare raids and Eidolon Nightmare this video. I did not have damage augments when I first cleared Nightmare New York Raid. There is a grind for the game but that grind is not required to enjoy the content of the game. The barrier to entry in the Secret World is very low. A player with a month of playing can do as much as  of the endgame players. Your analysis focuses on the  who have maxed everything within the game.,MMORPG,d55x0pk,3,t5_2qlxw

You were competing for resources and needed to setup these extractors and they mine the resource. You come back and collect the resource every so often and it puts it towards your teams resources.

Do you think that new players will conclude that they shouldnt ever wear any armor after encountering ghosts because it doesnt always work?a new player wouldnt even know what cursed is much less conclude that armor is useless vs ghosts. they get hit because they couldnt block or dodge attacks not because armor is helping them negate damage. maybe because ghosts have an aura that makes blocking useless and needs to be cancelled by a holy spell? maybe only clerics can deal with ghosts? they dont knowgtbecause in a turnbased game that has dynamic content IE procedurally generated encounters or PvP the situations will always be differentyou can always survey the battlefield and determine your priorities. for example if you have a fire spell that can be cast in the first round you would want to always use it on the most threatening target or any unit that has a weakness to fire. the situation might be different each fight but you have a priority queue you can follow when dealing with different scenarios. gtAll it does is demonstrate the potential of their respective genres for more varied types of gameplay that hopefully creates new ways to entertain players.i would say its more about taking elements from other genres and adding to own than demonstrating potential of yours. i mean whos not to say that there can exist a game that includes every genre under the sun? ,MMORPG,d5g0xm2,1,t5_2qlxw

WoW does have some good gear that can be bought with gold but the best gear always comes from the hardest raids.  You can buy gold for cash but its not really pw.GW definitely has a bit more of a pw element to it.  Its definitely pw that you have to buy HoT to have the elite specs most of which are objectively better than the regular specs.  You can also drop like  we the current conversion rates are Im too lazy to look at it and get a full set of ascended armor and weapons.  Once you get full ascended though your power gain stops you cant keep throwing money at the screen for more power.Then you have what a lot of Asian games do with the upgrading weapons bullshit.

8452524,0,t3_4vdtim,TLDR This crying about PW is bullshit because you not buying power but Time.Well there too much people who crying about something irrelevant.You can buy official gold which then can be changed in silveringame currency  this is the same system that you can find in GW. Somehow no one cries about GW being PW as i know.Premium purchased for silver  ingame currency and you have various ways to aquire it. For example by buying it from official shop. Lets say this game were FP from the start then you could still buy this silver but from numerous bots and chinesee farmers. Like you could in GW EVE WOW etc. Yes they banned but you still can do this and could do this before. So whats the difference?Someone said that he can spent  a week on AO so what you gonna do with it? Buying Gold and trading for silver which doesnt give you advantages because pretty much everything crafted by players and if you have tons of silver from the start you still cant buy anything because there nothing on market. It just help you to enjoy pvp without caring about what gonna happen if you die because you have silver to buy new equip. Which means you simply buy your time making game more casual for yourself.I dont know about all this bonuses on sub i only know that LP collect helps afk characters to level up slowly than active players so you can buy premium go on vacation or business trip and still have some progression. So you still buying only time not power. For example the same in ESO you should pay your money for this kind of bonuses. Saying that EVE sub doesnt give you advantages maybe true but at the same time they have tons of sales and other stuff that let you have advantages for example Buy  months and get  months MCU. You also can buy PLEX and sell it to buy ship so also PW? Somehow no because you can easily lose your ship just like your equip in pvp of AO. You can also now buy this new skill reset stuff that let you relocate k exp.I dont know policy of AO devs on starting release packages but at this momment everyone who bought any pack have  month sub which puts them on the same level of progression with bonuses. In one month im pretty sure you can farm enough silver for sub by any means.So simply putting it all together You can buy your time with ingame currency or your own money. Bonuses to gathering are irrelevant because in this game you cant be effective jack of all trades which means even if you can gather tons of resources and you doesnt have an alt for crafting or no one who can craft for you  its useless. You will be needed to sacrifice your progression in PvEPvP for the sake of your gear. Which slow you despite all this bonuses to LP and Exp. Dunno about guilds but i think guilds pretty much can gather silver for each member without problem if they aint casual one and if their casual then they definetly dont care about top giersub bonusesprogression.,MMORPG,d5y3o24,1,t5_2qlxw

Everyone is at level  with all talents available and you can select an amulet that gives you the stat combination you want for whatever build you are playing. You also select sigils for your weapon. So its very balanced in that sense. However there are still flavor of the month classes based on Arena Nets balancing.ampnbspThen World vs World where you battle on a humongous map to take castles and towers run resources. There are a few different maps and the battles can be large scale zerg fights or you can roam around in small groups. It can be extremely fun but also extremely annoying depending on how it goes. In this mode everyone is boosted to level  but you still lack any skills you have not unlocked and gear matters a bit. Its the open world pvp feel I guess.ampnbspI have not played Elder scrolls but I hear the pvp in that is just one open world map type thing. Unclear how balance is or anything im sure someone else can inform us how it works.ampnbspI really enjoy gw pvp its an mmo so pvp is not perfect but it does get a lot of attention from the developers so its done quite well.ampnbspEdit There are no healers in Gw everyone is somewhat self sufficient but there are support abilities.,MMORPG,d6ewus7,1,t5_2qlxw

8836105,0,t3_517qhe,Firstly raiding in any MMO if done right is a very rich and deep teamwork experience.   For most people being part of a team and interacting with friends is a key component of the experience.gt Why is facing the same boss month after month exhilarating for you? Is the loot that worth it?World of Warcraft has a progression system and variable difficulty levels for each encounter.  Bosses go from challenging to farmed over time and become easier and easier as the team gears up and becomes more experienced with the fight.   Then hard modes can be selected and the fight changes significantly.  Once a boss is beaten the challenge becomes to defeat it quickly so the next boss can be reached earlier.   For these reasons every time you enter a boss fight its different from the last time.gt How do you move past the fact that your gear is going to get recycled and seen as useless in a relatively short amount of time? Do you wish that were different? E.g. having Hand of Ragnaros still have competitive value to this day.This isnt any different to having additional levels added every time an expansion comes out.  We must accept that progression is part of the game.  If you decide for yourself that it isnt you can just stop progressing any time you like.   To quote Garfield the lasagne loving cat Its not the having its the getting.gt People complain that MMOs get easier as expansions come out. I am one of them. Do you find that raids are the same way?Blizzard spends most of its time developing raid content.  They made a decision during the first two xpacs to make content more readily available.  LFR pug raiding is facerollingly easy  its a tour of the content.  They want everyone to see the content and the storyline.   But theres also normal and heroic raiding so players can face increased challenges and many do.  Theres still quite a lot of respect for worldfirst boss kills in hardmodes. Theres always naysayers who claim the content should be exclusive to only a handful of players but to me that seems incredibly selfish.gt If you could change raiding how would you change it?I really wouldnt change anything.  Blizzard know exactly what theyre doing  they dont have millions of subscribers for any random reason.  They built a game thats both accessible to all and yet allows players to set their own challenges and at the peak provides top tier difficulty with rich and uniquely crafted encounters.   They know what theyre doing so I trust them to keep following their set path.,MMORPG,d79z4k2,6,t5_2qlxw

I hated the feeling of reaching level cap only to feel like I still had another week of played to even be able to do what I wanted. I know they have the champion point system or whatever its called now but it seems the like kind of the same thing to me... And also I know you could start doing veteran content and stuff at vr but I just have this thing where I feel like I need the best gear to be happy and the best gear was available at vr. ,MMORPG,d7fa6bd,4,t5_2qlxw

Most of gamers pay  dollars for a triple A game and they get maybe  hours of game out of that? with  bucks you can play an MMO for months and months.Can we please stop using horrible analogies like this. The  hours I spent in The Witcher  were me exploring a beautifully crafted world with an incredible story with a constant stream of things to do no matter what type of mood I was in. It contained a fully functional game within the game known as Gwent. There were hundreds of unique NPCs and enemies to encounter and everything was incredibly polished. Thats why a AAA game is worth  for less hours than a MMO. No MMO dont you dare claim World of Warcraft because holy crap the quests do not compare and my lord the visuals audio controls and overall polish are nowhere near identical has the same quality.

9257977,0,t1_d8phjyt,Sorry if I spurred confusion. Im not trying to imply these cases are different. Im stating that this situation cant be handled the same as you probably wont see similar results.I commented to state how just because you see Jagex having perfectly fixed their issues it wouldnt be the same for Blizzard. WoW would be competing with itself because the games are just vastly different. Far more than OSRS and RS. Were talking bloated Talent Trees Minus  classes Faction Restricted Classes no personal loot no pvp Arena Classes having a bloat of resources they have to carry around Im sure Im missing more but theres so much thats changed since then.These two games would DEFINITELY compete with themselves if the theoretical legacy servers became super popular. Thats why I say Runescape is more of an outlier even though we see differently on what is cohesive and what isnt bottom line is Jagex were at a point where if they didnt make this move theyd be worse off. Blizzard arent and I feel the opposite would happen if they did.,MMORPG,d8pik9j,1,t5_2qlxw

9264722,0,t1_d8qa1lq,Dont Loose time with L. I played it for like  years. You just cant catch players on oficial servers. As I remember they even delete lvl cap. The best time in L was during Cinterlude. The game was SO grindy. Remember lvling my character in stakato nest  hours per day Day after Day to get a few  on experience Wich i lost in Castle Sieges Next week. But damn. That game was awesome. Guild hall you have to coorporate with players to be ok in higher areas or get better equip. If you wanted to craft S grade which was BIS you have to do Quest in high area and kill  mobs then you have to move to something like dungeon to take recipe. That recipe was !!! D Then you need to find dwarfie player with profesion of Treausure hunter Spoil and go farm keys and lot of mats. Then you have to find another kind of player dwarfie warsmith to craft that weapon. In higher area if you were DPS you need to have atleast on buffer player one MP supporter player Bladedancer for dance buff for  min and sometimes even Swordsinger with songs for min. So you have to coorporate with so many people. And i am not talking about Castle Sieges where clans with  people on average try to conquer Castle and capture it. You could capture it for two weeks when you have it you could set taxes manage seeds for mats and your clan leader could fly on wyvern which was super awesome. Also epic bosses like Baium Antharas Valakas you have to First fight your way because these bosses werent instance they just respawned after one week and First clan who get there could fight him. I dont even went to school when my clan conquer Baium. Oh man.. PS sorry for mistakes my english is not great also have super clever autocorrect on my mobilephone.,MMORPG,d8qdb7d,1,t5_2qlxw

Which if when you buy or on the durate of his life until those  months pass doesnt do its role you can get a full refund. Its how law works. Also paypal is known and even state it themselves that they will side with the costumers almost all the time. Did you check if that lawyer is truly a lawyer? Because you just need to freaking google the laws and see that i am right. No everyone that does a proper explination for the charge back will win the chargeback. Yes they did say that in idk about  or  interviews before and after launch. Also the customer decides how he sees your product not you as a game dev. If he sees it as pw and can argument why it is pw for him he will win the chargeback. It how it ALWAYS worked. All companies spend time arguing chargebacks. But they lose in  of the cases. You can see for yourself it is what happens on steam too.No digital laws apply to a product with all its feature updates. If i buy an iphone  and they do a software update and it explodes because of it or doesnt work like i wanted it to work anymore i can get a full refund. Again you have no idea whatsoever about what you are talking.Valve gives you an EXACT period of time aka less  hours INGAME from what i remember before you are not allowed to get a refund.

If you want you can pay a couple bucks so you can have more than  character.  to farm gear and  to level up and die to unlock stuff. It is a fun game but can be frustrating as a bit of lag you can lose a character with  hours worth of stuff. But if you dont have  hours to invest you probably wont ever have that problem. Overall its fun. If you want a game that you can function with little time spent. Warframe is interesting maps are relatively short it takes about  hours to understand the game and the movements then start joining void runs and selling the parts you can start working on endgame builds without worrying about leveling everything up. ,MMORPG,d9yqwbm,2,t5_2qlxw

Those who offended are still playingposting daily.To put it into perspective I know a person that was banned for  weeks just a few hours after he was reported. His infraction was to trash talk another player. By the other hand the racists were never punished even after weeks of reports from several people.

9717268,0,t1_daau1mq,Well I should preface that I am not a fan of Star Citizen nor am I against it I just know of it and looking forward to what it can bring or remove from the gaming world. As for the scepticism for me it would boil down to the money and what they are aiming to do with their budget and what their budget compares to other titles and what they achieves. They have thus far garnered M in crowd funding. That is M from hyped fans and that is first and by far foremost on my scepticism list. Look at every preordered game that flopped because people fell for the marketing. Star Citizen is just that on a higher level.Secondly look at what they plan to have in the game. I have heard them talking about systems that boggle the mind like having real other player crewmen running around your ship while you are in ship to ship combat persistent universe FPS and ship combat intertwined etc etc.This is not cheap interlapping completely different systems like this and in ways no one has ever done before. Now back to funding. They have M  whatever they are given by not fans Is that even a thing or is it puerly crowd funded? I dont even know.Lets say somehow they make it to M so M from other sources pure dev budget. That is near twice what GTAV had M Budget for both marketing and dev and look what that game came with. It simply doesnt compare to Star Citizens marketing.I simply can not see Star Citizen making the game they are marketing with the conceivable budget they could have. I do not see them getting M of other revenue to make up a more believable number In my mind of which I am basically ignorant.This is just from my point of view as someone that hears about Star Citizen in passing. Do I want the game to deliver everything it says it will? Absolutely I believe that would not only be a step but a leap forward for gaming.Will I be surprised if people gave millions upon millions of dollars into marketing just to be burned yet again? Absolutely not.  ,MMORPG,daav4ca,3,t5_2qlxw

10034381,0,t1_dbffnix,It wont exactly work like that. When you create a character you wont know if you have a unique talent. Talents are uncovered by performing certain tasks or interacting with the world in a given way. So Bob could join the mmo and decide he wants to be an innkeeper so he focuses on building an inn and starting a brewery or becoming a great chef etc. Unbeknownst to Bob he has a rare talent that allows him to breathe underwater idk if thats a thing just for sake of example but since he never ventured out in a lake or river he never discovered that he had that talent. Two months into playing the game Bob decides hes going to try his hand at fishing and blah blah he gets stranded in a lake blah blah discovers he has the talent to breathe underwater.

I mean more often that not the world felt dead there werent many people playing only a few clansalliances dominating. And the end is known to us all...What are you gonna do differently so that the world isnt empty or atleast doesnt feel so? Since Im afraid that the community is gonna split in the  DF remakes thus you have one more factor considering that problem.First of all do you recognise that Darkfall is a game that needs a proper amount of players so that its features the economy the fights the guild politics work?You think that you will be able to gather that amount of players and why?And what are you gonna do differently so that the game doesnt have the same fate that the original darkfall had?Moreover as far as Im concerned the NewDawn team is working on repairing the games code in order to fix most of the bugsexploitsissues and have a longterm result. While you are working more on lets say eyecatching changes may you want to comment on that?Thank you for your time. See you in Agon!,MMORPG,dbkeh6l,3,t5_2qlxw

10121170,0,t3_5kqybj,In order to create an ideal exploration system the following needs to be true Exploration needs to be rewardable Teleportation needs to be limited The World must be relatively empty.That last one is very hard to do given how densely packed MMOs need to be thanks to server limitations and the like. You also dont want it TOO empty but a happy medium like Skyrim would do well. Small meaningless towns that dot the map and provide little other than lore frequently changing landscape via forests and fields and hills and mountains.As for Teleportation thats fairly simple. Restrict Teleportation to ONLY the major cities. Allow guilds to save up and purchase exceptionally expensive teleportation points which they set the rules for ie say a miners guild finds and extremely rare mineral node. They could charge people access to use their teleport or restrict it to guild members only and hoard the resourcesThe first bullet is quite simple. As alluded to before you need a wide open world but more than that you need to put rare resources in out of the way locations so that people will have a desire to go out and find stuff. In an idealized setting even endgame raids would be hidden out in the world. Imagine being a sailor and stumbling upon the ruins of an ancient underwater civilization and then being allowed to charge people out the ass to visit it so that endgame raiders have to pay to attempt it and in such a system the loot would have to be equally amazing of course.,MMORPG,dbqsnkn,2,t5_2qlxw

10136151,0,t1_dbruf1v,You have to consider the history behind some of those decisions. The super early game cant be too relevant because of botsabuse. especially for fp titles. its too easy to just create a script to create a new account and then create a few AWS instances to bot for you. Early game cant and wont ever be relevant again outside of being a tutorial. at least not until we find a better way to mitigate the effect of bots. Nearly every mmo released prior to like  has a story about bots or players abusing early quest rewards to get ahead andor make tons of cash. Unfortunately subbp doesnt really mitigate this. a lot of the above deters casual botters but the dedicated guys are a different story. they often have stolen CCs and will get a month or so of farming before the accounts are canceledbanned. so anything really lucrative needs to require effort or be difficult enough that you cant easily bot it.Which means developers need to make a choice. we can push back relevancy to protect the player base from abusive behavior and make sure there is a high barrier to entry for botting. or we can just make money irrelevant. Some games have done both quest rewards bind on pickup until you get to endgame. and by making sure you get all the gear you need while you level your money basically just pools until it becomes relevant in endgame or is spent on cosmetics. I know i certainly dont miss farming money to buy a level  sword or we. Most modern games are very casual friendly. While I have experienced some push in games this is almost always a result of the community and not the gameplaydevelopment. Played lots of stuff that isnt new player friendly but this isnt the same as casual unfriendly. ,MMORPG,dbsqthi,1,t5_2qlxw

10140308,0,t3_5kqybj,I havent found an mmo that does it for me since SWG. To me that was the perfect mmo. Just about everything I ever wanted in an mmo and it took place in the Star Wars Universe. Player ran cities economy mounts customizable player housingnot instanced open world faction based pvp customizable space ships space combat can decorate spaceship interior and friends can move around and interact in your spaceship big open world with tons of quests and things to do bounty hunting real players advanced lightsaber crafting. The list goes on and on. I hope we get something similar in the future. I havent played an mmo in years and am itching to get back into it but theres nothing out there that comes close now a days for me personally to keep me interested.SWTOR didnt even keep me interested and I followed that game religiously and pre ordered. Played a few months and never looked back. I know times are changing and people dont want to spend  hours a day in a game. But I think thats when you know you have a great mmo is when you can get lost and live in it and  hours goes by and it feels like you just logged in not long ago. ,MMORPG,dbtabob,1,t5_2qlxw

It didnt take me long to figure out that to be successful in PvP as a primarily solo player I needed at least one of the following speed ranged attack or stealth.  I settled on a classthe only classthat provides all three Hunter.  It was a very enjoyable class if a bit of underdog and I managed to claw my way to the top of the Hunter pvp board.  Note that Hunter is not a highly prized class for pvp groups.  A good one can help the group by peeling aggro off your healer but most groups would prefer classes that are more groupfriendl. meaning heals buffs etc.  Hunter is really a solo swiss army knife.

10198671,0,t3_5lwbfl,Id second Final Fantasy XIV on PC or PS. It doesnt have a VR headset permadeathvery rare or multiple game universes. But it does have beautiful graphics player housing allinone character skill system great crafting  floor deep dungeon casual raids for  parties of  fun boss fights and a Japanese art style. its all around about as close as you can get to a SAOlike experience in my opinion. The tabtargeting style of the game really isnt that offputting because at max level rotations are tight with lots of off the GCDGlobal cooldown instant skills and you have to dodge a lot so it feels pretty action dominant. It will feel slow at first though. Play Monk or Ninja if you want faster attack speed. Also has a very good story once you get to Heavensward content!Edit Should mention TERA as well it also has very nice graphics but with combat closer to SAO.

I got it out of my system took a long break from WoW and went back to building myself a real life.Last year I came back to the game and tried arenas again. I wasnt too bad but I got destroyed by every great player. It just takes so much time to get good at and as much time to stay sharp and competitive.

Also he claimed by using all that donation money to pay for a full time developer Adam the server would never have an issue with developers leaving and there would be a constant stream of content built for the server. Which anyone who has played the server knows is largely a joke and weve gotten mostly minor tweaks and aesthetic donation stuff over the last few years and everything else probably any coder could knock out in a few weekends or so Im guessing.Sorry Im just kinda frustrated at this point.

It works in a game were you use your reflexes and mechanical skill to vanquish deadly bosses but I would take ye old spell rotations and tabtargeting anyday for an MMO. Not only do they have more strategic depth many different possible effects but theyre also easier to implement than precise hitbox tracking. Also magic in Dark Souls is bad and theres no denying it. Its also pretty hard to design group PvE around a system that  is easily be hampered by crowded interfacesEVE Onlines economy is a very cool concept for sure. Its also mutually exclusive with good PvE content and fantasy settings.

So between ascended and legendary there isnt a stat progression but legendaries have the quality of life that you can change the stats on the go and is therefore more useful than ascended.

If it changed and you didnt like it its generally more difficult to refund. If it was another product or service it wouldnt be so much of a problem but since the whole idea of early access games revolves around this uncertainty of what direction the game will take or even if the developers will do anything at all if people could claim refunds games since they dont like them later on then early access wouldnt be nearly as prominent. It will be more difficult to obtain a refund and it will need to involve external means and a fair bit of effort on your part. Generally from that it wouldnt feel worth getting a refund for the amount of effort it would take to legally fulfil the procedures required.

Every ruin in the game has a history every place filled with monsters has a history of its own. Every species of monsters has a history and how they ended up where they are. If you never bothered to LOOK for the lore IN THE GAME while playing dont say that its not there.This game has x more lore than GW. Its just not leid out like a story. You have to search for it. Find clues. Put pieces together like in a puzzle. Pls....I love to read the lore of games and the one in BDO is the most complex up to date. And the fact that you have to look for it explore the world find hidden caves and ruins hidden libraries and pages spread thorugh the world for it makes it  times better than other mmorpgs.Bdo is definitely not the best mmorpg out there. It has big issues that can be fixed easly. Its just that its played by  types of players casuals that want everything handled to them and ppl that love what bdo is and the devs cant decide which side to please.Not to mention that the world amp the lore is incomplete.

10411691,0,t3_5p3jpy,Dungeons and raids are far far better in ESO than in GW as is crafting and new stories I guess you mean new questzones and stories but if you are not interested in these things as you wrote it is basically the same endcontent  thieves guild heists and assassins contracts  stealing. But it has no sPvP only unranked v v v. not sure about the last For hardcore gamers it offers some of the hardest raids out there and you have the possibility to do ranked PVE trials where you can compare your raidarena success to others and get rewards in the end for a good ranking The same goes for WvWBut Id suggest to try a cheap version of ESO at first. ESO is quite different to the typical GWFFWoW approach when it comes to gameplay and not everyone likes it. Champion Points are another thing it doesnt matter what you do in endgame you will always have progression unlike the mentioned games.

ESO implemented one tamriel because the main problem that ESO faced over the years is group play two players would ideally be  levels apart to do contents with each other. So if you were a returning player from a long break and you are like  ish it would be very hard for you to find people who are same level as you and so the game would end up in this vicious cycle where returning players cant really get motivated enough to tried the game again. One tamriel changed that but that is because scaling everyones level is probably the cheapest solution to solve their problem at hand but not necessarily a feature that you would want to have an MMO start out with.,MMORPG,dczm3o7,1,t5_2qlxw

WTF you didnt feel real BDO are you nuts those graphics are  best world seamless world no instances balbalbal.. well we didnt have instances in UO.. the map was so huge.. you could walk to anywhere from city to city.. etc ofc it would take you ages at time thats why we had telepoertswaypoint system.I guess players should really start rethinking their visual preferences over gameplay. Companies spend  times more money on graphic artistd etc that revolves around art rather than gameplay mechanics designs. Also its pretty clear... each new MMO we get theres peopel complaining about bugsunbalance too boring etc etc same old mundane gameplay..blahblah...blahblah...I guess we should change our criterias a bit to force the devs to reconsider if people decide to move from newer graphic games to older graphics and few MMOs lose numbers maybe there can be change.Sorry for the wall of text.,MMORPG,dd744gz,3,t5_2qlxw

10605592,0,t1_dd9sm6g,I never played much of WoW and I never got to try vanilla. I think I started around mid august playing and reached level cap around two weeks ago. I dont have much to do in my free time and lotro has been pretty much the only game I played in that period. Im guessing I spent around  hours on my main though I skipped over a lot of areas and stayed longer than necessary in others. I also spend a lot of time reading most of the quest text so my time in game could very well not be very reflective on how long someone else takes to reach level cap. ,MMORPG,dd9vwcl,2,t5_2qlxw

Took forever but was soooo worth it. But with ESO.... might have just been how the early game was but I found it felt too easy. Most enemies were dying in a few hits and doing no damage to me. And any enemy that could do a decent chunk of damage the other players would come over to help and make the challenge just disappear.

All game items are very affordable without PW but nevertheless it gives you an instant boost. The game predominantly being skill based however means you will still floormat if you want to try get gear carried and will be destroyed in DPS by someone with far inferior gear.gtWould you consider the push through content and leveling a small investment a moderate investment or heavy investment of your time?If you want to have good enough gear to just clear everything then small investment.  weekend every  months is enough to keep up. If you want BiS everything then heavy investment you will want to play  hours a day.gtAre there any devastating bugs or extreme imbalances present?No devastating bugs. Classes are not balanced but the gap is not extreme. Strongest to weakest is probably  DPS difference.gtDoes the cash shop feel like it intentionally limits your cosmetic options if you dont use it?Yes and no. Usually cash armor sets are the ones that dont fit into the lore e.g. business suits. The ingame armor is available all for free under monster dropped fashion coupons. You can wear the appearance of any gear set as a cosmetic. There are many free cosmetic to choose from although most endgame players opt to buy some form of cash shop cosmetic either with real money or in game currency.gtWhat is the most major complaint of the game you can think ofRepetitive and not much to do outside combat. Relatively low incentive to progress.gtwhat is the biggest positive that has you gravitate toward and play or continue to play if youre a veteran TERA?Whoever doesnt say combat is lying.

10726870,0,t1_ddm5ec4,Except this is ignoring how the rest of the technological world has affected MMOs as well. Even when WoW was released the best social media site was MYSPACE. It was terrible and besides that and random forums the best way to socialize in a niche like gaming was IN THE GAMES. This is why your MMOs of yore was so vibrant with talking and socializing. Nowadays theres so many network options to ask questions and talk to and voice comms are free and can be filled up with hundreds of people. Hell this subreddit is exactly an outcome of it.Players stopped being social in these games because their social norms changed. Likewise companies kept trying to sell you on their next big MMO and the price of full game combined with a monthly fee made players weary of staying and making friends due to drop outs and the value of making connections you may not commit to. Developers NEEDED to compensate for this. Due to such you have in game dungeon finder and the ability to solo content. The thing is if you really do enjoy an MMO youll find a group to talk to about it and play together.Your problem is instead of just making friends in these MMOs in the new standard you want to just talk in game and expect people to talk back.

PERSON. state that a newbie should take their time explore each aspect of the game and then work into long term goals while setting small ones. Mine are smaller than yours? Cool.

10817780,0,t3_5ty011, What are you looking for?Open world. FP preferrably with no heavy PW. A game that relies mostly on grinding monsters via v attacking or AoE skills with bosses and dungeons. Preferred graphic style would be the animefantasy style similar to FlyFF. I loved FlyFF and the mechanics of the Sword Art Online MMO mostly from the novel What games have you previously played?Fly For Fun for a long time  loved it. WoW for a short time hated the questing style. Blade and Soul  short time I didnt like the fact that I was mostly fighting humans which made me feel like I was playing Skyrim or whatever RPG. Skill reliant combat was boring. What is your playstyle CasualSemiCasualHardcore?SemiCasual to Hardcore. I like it when the game offers benefits to people who like to spend a lot of time and effort. Any preferred mechanics?No purely skill based combat. MeleeBow classes should mostly fight with standard attacks scaled through crit I imagine a balance between auto attacks and skills should exist while mage classes mostly use spellsskills. By this I mean I wanna be able to start attacking a mob and dont have to spam my buttons to deal damageA leveling experience that is worthwhile the journey and not a hassle to be able to start actually playing when you hit maxlevel.Large mob spawns. No cluster of  mobs for killquests there should be enough for many people to play with AoE skills.Bosses to farm on lower levels as well as higher be able to upgrade your items be able to grind for your own gear. Anything specific you want to exclude?Recycled leveling quests or questheavy games in general. I dont wanna spend  of the time running around  different areas to repeat the same quests over and over again.Games that only really start when you hit Maxlevel there should be enough exciting stuff to do while leveling.This is propably very nich and specific but Im very frustrated with trying to find a game again which I can sink myself into whenever I have freetime not commit to a min league game but rather make progress with my character by killing mobs for minutes or something along the lines.,MMORPG,ddvs0cm,1,t5_2qlxw

10853174,0,t1_ddzf497,gt procedural generation with an objectiveThis is exactly what Rifts in Diablo  are. Procedural generation just adds to the players frustrations when you get dungeon randomized without the most optimal monstersbuffs.BackgroundOne of the main reasons Diablo I garnered so much critical and cult success was due to the fact that the random elements in the game compelled the player to continue playing rather than just finishing the game and move on to another. This is a concept known as replayability in the gaming realm and Diablo had much more of it than any other game of its time from the perspective of many fans.All Diablo games so far have also had elements of static gameplay such as unique items as well as parts of the maps always having the same layout or in some cases very similar. The Diablo II Chaos Sanctuary is a prime example of this.,MMORPG,ddzff5t,1,t5_2qlxw

10913628,0,t1_de5leth,I liked Tera but the game has turned into lolicon barbie dress up after the first year of release. Im a bearded male who wants to connect with a character. Ive read articles that there are two main types of players in MMOs players that view their characters as an extension of themselves and players who see their characters as a separate person who they control their actions. I can see how Terras gender lock wouldnt affect and even appeal to players in the second category. Im definitely someone in the first category. I played a male in every MMO since FFXI. Teras combat is really immersive and I like that about the game but Ill be damned if Im going to be a loli even though the reaper class appealed to me. I couldnt stand the  loli player base. Every town city and leveling zone had  loli population. It was just jarring. Im not an RPer by any means but I at least want a baseline level of immersion. Terra devs know their player base and going in this direction with female only classes is a move I dont fault them for. Most cash shop items and armor designs are made specifically for these lolis and wasting time developing the low pop male class armor  clothes is a waste of time for them. However dont be surprised when players like myself leave the game when ever single new class is gender locked.,MMORPG,de5nvys,22,t5_2qlxw

Only draw back is its age and SLOW content.

11095628,0,t3_5yd1nb,The leveling process is just an annoying wall you have to get over before you can begin the real grind which is endgame gearing.Not to say that the initial leveling experience cant be enjoyable but once you create alt characters leveling just becomes exponentially more annoying.Im not a fucking teenager anymore either. I never used to get this perspective when I was younger but not only do I not have the time I also dont always have the will. IRL work drains me. Ive played MMOs for literally almost half of my life at this point leveling is more work. I absolutely dont want to do more work especially after getting home from work.MMOs are stale. They need a drastic overhaul. This whole concept that you need to work towards having fun needs to die. gt Oh leveling is easy but the real challenge comes at endgame I hear this and think... then whats the point of leveling?gt Whats the point of easy dungeons? Just let me do the hard dungeons... let me practice in those.gt Why do I have to be gated doing content I dont want to do just so I can eventually get to the content I do want to do?Kids today dont gravitate towards MMOs like I did amp I cant blame them. You can download a MOBA right now and start playing the only limiting factors being your skill amp how much money you can spend on champions.Everyone so often Ill play a nonMMO amp I always have this epiphany where Im like Wait wait... I can have fun right away... I dont have to run dungeons for  weeks... I dont have to level through braindead easy content...I could ramble for pages about this but IMO leveling isnt the problem MMOs on a mechanical level are. There are still aspects about MMOs that I enjoy but there is so much timeconsuming bullshit gating you from simply enjoying those aspects that leveling just becomes another chore.,MMORPG,depohb4,1,t5_2qlxw

11208685,0,t3_5zwcuv,The biggest reason ingame community building isnt as strong is. The use of voice chat over ingame text.. The existence of free to use group chats such as skype and discord. These helped to not make a guild with ventrillo or teamspeak seem special.. Players realizing they can actually play more than one game and talk to their friends through the use of chat programs.. People have just moved on from playing just that one game it seems. Players rarely identify as I play insert game here. Yes players do aim for being in Top tier guilds so they can do the hardest raiding content or participate in the Large combat PvP.To add a little bit more. My first MMO experience was runescape. There were some group activities and you could team up with peoplenot with a party system. But it was a rather solo experience with alot of people around you. Another thing is players actually hid information from each other far more often. There days people share info in hopes of being the first to get those reddit upvotes or youtube views. Being internet famous is something people strive for at the moment. The sheer amount of information easily obtainable on the net allows people to solo and pug group content alot easier.Also as others have said there isnt that ONE mmo people play anymore. People are spread among several games including the ton of FP games.,MMORPG,df2hppq,2,t5_2qlxw

You had the Greeks Egyptians and Celts available right off the bat. When you got to lv. you unlocked the Persians Babylonians and Norse. It was fairly fun and managed to be entertaining. Sadly the game flopped. They stopped adding to it in  and it was closed down mid. Sadly thats been the fate of every single real time strategy MMO thats been released.

You can make up for the learning with gear so people are just going to wait.Blizzard changed their scaling so  mobs so they partially scale with the gear you have. This change has been on the PTR but people are just now bitching about it cause they cant pull half the zone and AoE it down now you can only pull half the zone. It didnt really change anything....The only real complaint I understand is that the nethershards that can be used to get  gear isnt bad to farm but the bosses you can summon give less shards than their nonboss type portals. They did hotfix so they should drop more but its not much of an improvement i think.

One issue though. That particular model is really low to the ground compared to a normal office chair  not an issue for flight or driving but when you have the keyboard arm attachment at a proper ergonomic height there isnt a lot of leg clearance.

Definitely complex.The trend is moving towards simpler though. Besides the ones I mentioned ArenaNets GW to GW removed subclasses and prechooses  skills for you based on weapon. Cryptics Champions Online to Neverwinter went from freeform to preselected skills and stats that barely make an impact.But at the same time the genre is shrinking.Dauntless is hype though.

11720946,0,t3_675asx,I feel like the genre has kind of moved on without me.  I started playing EQ in the early s I started playing when Shadows of Luclin came out with some friends from work.  The feeling of just logging into that world a persistent living world with millions of other players was enough to keep me entertained.  Questing lore grinding for levels and social interaction was all new and exciting.  The game was hard and unforgiving if you died better run naked to your corpse before it and all your gear was gone.   Buying a horse was months maybe years memory is slippery of work and an amazing accomplishment.  The legfends of monsters that were unkillable spawns that you had to wait for weeks for.  No youtube videos telling you how to defeat every raid boss no DPS parsers having a bard in your group a character whos sole job it was to buff you.   Remember trying to play an evil race and getting instakilled trying to go to a town?  To me it comes down to structure.  The game was less structured there was no little arrows to follow or hell there wasnt even a fucking  in game map!  I had to buy a book EQAtlas and use maps in a fucking book to figure out how to get out of the starter area.  You got dropped into a world that felt limitless and that feeling is gone.  Its not even about the dumbing down or the cash shops its all about having a to do list when I play.  Its not exciting its less social and way more structured.  All MMORPGs are like this now no matter how much I read about new ones the fact of the matter is Blizzard gave the world a recipe to make millions upon millions of dollars in the MMORPG sector and this is the result of that.  We my gaming friends called WoW World of Noobcraft when it came out because it felt so simple and too user friendly and casual to have fun.  Now people talk of Vanilla WoW like it was some kind of grind.  Which compared to now it was but what we see today is the evolution of that era WoW and EQ both of which I played for years and did enjoy.  The next step was cash shops which honestly comes down to the fact that there was always a gray market for this crap.  I remember there being a pretty active USD Norrath Gold currency exchange.  It was only a matter of time before the devs of these games realized the market and took their piece of the pie.  All in all yes the genre has changed.  I still play MMORPGs daily ESO has been my go to the last  years.  It will never be like it was because entertainment has changed the industry has changed and accessibility and ease of play is more important than having a cool unforgiving world.  Also MMORPGs used to cater to a very small niche market.  I was ruthlessly mocked for playing these games when I was younger and now that cater to a wide range of audiences which isnt a bad thing.  Its different and realize EQ is still there if you want to play it but ask yourself why arent you?  ,MMORPG,dgolkjl,2,t5_2qlxw

11722930,0,t3_677t40,Ive always found that theme park MMOs try to offer you different types of experiences but always with a fixed goal in mind. Youre offered quests dungeons raids pvp etc. with the goal of getting specific gear or items that you want to get. There is a lot you can do for your own character but not much you can contribute to the world itself. Sandbox MMOs are less defined. There are dungeons and raids and whatnot but how and why you choose to do them is less directed than theme park games. Theres also a lot more room for your character to have an impact on other players or the world itself. Ive never been able to connect to a sandbox game myself. I get the appeal but Im one of those people that always likes to have a defined goal to achieve and I dont really like being the one to set that. ,MMORPG,dgotoos,1,t5_2qlxw

11733356,0,t3_67fi7v,The proper way is not to fit as much players as possible into a single hardware server rather to design the whole game the way which allows to handle the game world on multiple hardware servers with possibility to increase the servers count in any moment.So I believe with proper design its possible to handle unlimited users count in the single game world until you have money to add new hardware servers.Im working on an largescale MMORPG project and my goal is to build it exactly this way to have strictly single game world for all players with no shards instances or channels at all.Usually MMO games are using a single hardware server to handle single game zone  it allows to handle theoretically unlimited zones amount but the hardest part is to handle lot of players in a single zone at the same time.One possible partial solution is from Eve Online  they are slowing down the ingame time in case of lot of players in a single system. So for players it looks like a slowmotion but it allows to use more time to calculate all ingame things.,MMORPG,dgq07yg,1,t5_2qlxw

11751536,0,t3_67etvy,Ill throw my two cents in for GW as well. The World bosses and Meta events like others have mentioned a more simplified version of raids but that isnt actually a bad thing. Its great to just be able to hop in or out of different battles on a huge map that contribute to the same goal of a large scale boss battle at the end. Also since the made the squad interface actually useful it replicates the raid feel even more. Often several commander players will each need to take groups of  to accomplish a specific task in these meta battles and then meet up and unite in order to take down the final target in usually an organized manner. TBH its a really great system they have atm and the few times I log on these days are to do these.,MMORPG,dgs2e2f,1,t5_2qlxw

I would say population is healthier in LotRO  in fact the game is healthier overall despite its age.  Which means youll make more money from trading.  SWTOR is kind of a ghost town these days.

Then again I kind of wanted the starter areas to feel more like the Normandy invasion but with Space alien nazis. Intense hedge row by hedge row shooting. All saving private Ryan but in space.
