28152,0,t3_1ufqmz,I think skibum said it best the sauce is the flavor of the entire dish make sure you like itthe basic rule of thai cooking is that you balance the four flavors salty sweet sour and bitter. If you think the dish is too sweet when you multiply the sauce add more sour or bitter elements.I feel like a lot of thai cuisine from my western perspective is breaking down the elements that must be in your chosen dish and then figuring out what you want your final sauce to taste like. I dont think Ive ever made the same peanut sauce twice as a home cook some days I want a little more sriracha and some days I want more lime and a little extra palm sugar.For pad thai the essential components are tamarind palm sugar fish sauce red chiles dried shrimp garlic with the lime cilantro and peanut garnishes. Look up a couple of different recipes see the basic ratios of everything and then start to play with it.Personally I love Thai food because of how much cooking good Thai food relies on your own taste buds.

To do that the recipe called for simply plopping a dollop of the ganache on top of the batter in each cup before baking.  Can that be done for these cupcakes with the lyshee curd filling?  The few tutorials Ive seen have the filling pretty much from top to bottom inside the cupcake amp I prefer just a surprise in the middlewhich is how these came out.  amp were quite tasty Sorry if this question is ridiculousI see the curd is to be refrigerateddoes it have to be cold before being placed in the cupcake?Thank you!,recipes,cewa6w4,1,t5_2qh56

201132,0,t3_1wdr1y,I make kale chips at least twice a week and I have some tips Dryness is key make sure the kale is super dry before you bake it. If you can find it use Dinosaur kale its much easier to cut and lay in the pan plus it cooks more evenly. Dont use the precut kale if you can avoid it if you do make sure there are no stems. The stems take so long to cook that usually the leaves end up burnt or the stems end up chewy which really ruins the chips. When you put the leaves on the pan try not to overlap them a lot they tend to go from dark green and crispy to brown and burnt very quickly and when they are overlapping you tend to get some that are burnt while others are still soggy. I also find rotating the pan halfway through baking helps a lot.   The real fun with kale chips is you can use whatever spices you like on it they are very bland so experiment! I have had great luck with Parmesan garlic powder BBQ seasoning bacon salt and curry powder. ,recipes,cf1cnvy,1,t5_2qh56

Thinly slice some chicken thighs if using bonein skinon then debone and remove skin.. Skim off the fat from the top of a can of coconut milk and fry over medium heat until the oil separates. If this doesnt happen use some vegetable oil. Add your curry paste and fry it in the oil for  minutes. This is probably the most important step.. Add the rest of the coconut milk and bring to a boil. Once boiling add chicken and turn down the heat to a simmer. Season with fish sauce and palm sugar brown sugar works too. Kaffir lime leaves if you got em.. Once the chicken is cooked through add your vegetables back in fresh sliced chilies for heat and a bunch of Thai basil. Serve with some rice.,recipes,cfbpvq8,2,t5_2qh56

315709,0,t1_cfd4spr,This is the fun part.  Refried is actually a misnomer because they are just mashed cooked beans.  Different beans have different textures when mashed which improves their character but from there it is all about what you add to them.  Pinto black white garbonzo.I just start by putting them in a blender or food processor with their liquid or drain them and use a small amount of broth enough for a smooth puree.  If too liquidy you can cook them down later.Then you need to select the fats and oils you want to use.  Traditional refried beans use lard but you get a very different flavor with bacon grease or olive oil virgin olive oil if you dont intend to cook them further would give them a great flavor.  Butter is amazing.Then you need other vegetable flavors though the vegetables need to be sauteed.  Onions garlic sweet and hot pepper carrot.  Once cooked they should be pureed separately.After all of this surprisingly you are still at base level because you need to select your tastes  sweet sour salty bitter and savory.  Just remember that sweet cancels out savory and salty cancels out bitter so you can have one or the other.And finally cheeses if you want and spices.  Americans prefer cheddar and sour cream with their refried but Mexicans prefer queso blanco white cheese or table cream which is less sour but cooks better or guacamole.Finally you can garnish them with chopped vegetables like pico de gallo and various salsas and sauces.  They work great on tortillas as dips for chips or vegetables or just on their own as side dishes.Guatemalans are big fans of refried black beans and have them on the side of the plate for breakfast lunch and dinner.,recipes,cfdhqjh,1,t5_2qh56

So my recipe is lighter on sugar than many others.  Also I like to keep the alcohol content of the final product fairly high .  This is because I always serve my limoncello with plenty of ice and some water again keeping the sweetness in check or with a mixer iced tea or sprite.This is a ratio recipe so choose the amount of limoncello you want and the desired final proof and calculate the other ingredients.Ingredients Grain alcohol Everclear  proof Lemons   per .

1711305,0,t1_cjtmqlk,FWIW most ginger root is a relatively similar shape long and thinrootlike if you will. Ive seen quite a few recipes where ginger is called for in inches because generally if you grate two inches off the end of any ginger root it will be a fairly similar amount. Ive also seen a few that say cut  slices which is similar. I guess it also assumes youve seen enough ginger roots to make an educated guess as to whether yours is fatter than normal so you can add less than two inches...Basically ginger is called for in a pretty vague way but effective enough to have the right impact on the flavour. Definitely not an accurate measurement but ginger is pretty hard to measure accurately without getting out a scale!,recipes,cjuvehs,1,t5_2qh56

A sweet lime pie still needs some Key limes for added tartness and aroma.  Without the Key limes it is a good lime pie for children who dont like the tartness as much.The traditional recipe used raw egg yolks and was a nobake pie.  The acidity of the lime juice reacted with the condensed milk to naturally thicken the pie.  And the proper Conch version used the egg whites for a meringue topping.  So it was baked just long enough for the meringue.And for a laugh there is the great animated Film Noir short entitled Key Lime Pie. ,recipes,cl0jkf4,5,t5_2qh56

Cut up into small small round pieces.Start preparing pasta.Saute the Zucchini in olive oil salt and pepper. Throw in the tomatoes either   ouch can or so or  tomatoes diced and it will create a sort of red sauce. Finally throw in the sausage that youve already cooked and cut up. Throw it over the pasta and add a very generous amount of parmesan. This is so fast and soooo delicious.

Diced dried prunes are surprisingly cheap if you can find them cheaper than raisins even and very tasty and will keep your poop flowing properly. Nuts not peanuts are really  good for you and sometimes worth it for snacks even though theyre pricy. Go to a supermarket near closing and see if you can get a discount rotisserie chicken use it for  or  meals then boil the bones for soup with some of your piles of frozen vegetables!

3088613,0,t1_coi4a3g,Ooooh Are you going to make me look in the text book to remember why we do this? Just kidding sort of. The oven has a gentler heat surrounding the entire fish. Cooking it all at the same time without over cooking the exterior. If not overcooked the fish will be flaky and moist. The reason I mentioned medium is because it seems your gf is new to fish. Medium just as in beef steak is still pink in the center. The fresher the fish the less I would cook it. But not if it will bother the person eating it. I might choose all oven or even broiler over all in pan on stove. But combo starting on stove moving to oven is common. And gives you a few precious moments to prepare the side dishes.Other thoughts rattling around in my head is to make an easy compound butter. Nothing but butter whipped with some fresh herbs dill or tarragon or your favorite Butter should be room temperature at time of service and garnish the hot fish on the plate with a melon ball improvise if you need to size dollop of the flavored butter melting on the fish as it is served. ,recipes,coi4spt,2,t5_2qh56

The thick gravy fried potatoes and cheese curds dont make much of a light snack.A good portion of poutine is enough to fill you for a full meal. However you might want to incorporate some sauted veggies such as onions mushrooms and bell peppers to make it more worthy of a complete meal. For the protein chicken beef pork and even lamb are very good.Concerning the cheese you must have some good fresh mozzarella available so that wont be too bad espacially compared to cheese curds that have been in the fridge for a week. Just make sure the humidity of the mozzarella isnt too high so itll be nice and stretchy and melt nicely.Oh and for the gravy be careful not to oversalt it. Poutine is a sneaky dish as a slightlytoosalty gravy will taste unbearably salty towards the end. The key is balance ,recipes,cqggth0,37,t5_2qh56

4365287,0,t3_3az1cl,There arent many foods that I have utter confidence about making...biscuits is one that I am absolutely a master of I was born and raised in the south biscuits were a staple and Ive been making them or helping make them since I was really young.You do want there to be little bits of butter but thats probably not why your biscuits are dense. Many people accustomed to making other kinds of breadtype things tend to overwork the dough. The more you knead it the more dense your biscuits will be as the gluten develops and binds. You should probably just think for a couple of minutes about working it and then stick it in the oven.Seriously though my process is that once the wet ingredients have been mixed into the dry dont use a mixer its easy to overdo it I just use the fork or spoon I used to mix up the dry ingredients likewise use a hand held dough blendercutter or a fork to mix in the butter dont use a powered mixer I dump out the soggy lump onto a bunch of flour on a flat surface. With heavily floured hands Ill pat down the dough fold it in half and then repeat. I do this about seven times adding flour as needed to avoid sticking or having the dough break apart. As with pie crusts cool ingredients is good so dont take too long to mix it all up after taking the butter and buttermilk out of the fridge.The perfect consistency is such that you could pull it apart without it stretching much. If it starts to act like pizza dough or even pie crust dough youve gone too far. The folds provide layers and the more you fold it the more layery itll be but too many and it becomes dense and not nice. Also dont use a rolling pin for biscuits. Youre just patting it down. If you arent overworking it it wont be tough enough to need any kind of tool to flatten it out.Also you might be using too little of the leavening agent. In my quest for the perfect biscuit recipe I found many that didnt rise like I like because of too little baking powder. I use quite a bit more than I would use in quick breads or similar for the same amount of flour.The recipe I came up with is this vegan buttermilk biscuit recipe its vegan but based on a traditional southern recipe that uses butter and buttermilk so if you dont want it to be vegan you can certainly use the dairy ingredients...though the vegan variant is as good as any biscuits Ive had.,recipes,cshpb6v,4,t5_2qh56

Readd eggs to pan when cabbage is almost done. Season to taste I like spicy cajun seasoning. Remove to bowl. Add diced onions and stir. Let sit for  minutes to cool and to steam the onions a little. Salt and pepper if your other spices werent these.I like this primarily because I like using my cast iron for breakfast. You can put piece of bread in and flip at  minutes. Remove when hot enough for eggs and butter.

7990999,0,t3_4omz7q,I had a poor relationship with veggies from growing up poor  we never had fresh veg so I didnt like it much at first. My way into eating more veg has been to roast it. Roasted Broccolini baby broccoli with long stems is amazing. Put broccolini in roasting pan drizzle with some melted ghee or use EVO and sprinkle some salt. Cook in the oven until it chars a little bit. This method also works with normal broccoli florets cauliflower and brussels sprouts. French beans can be blanched and then quickly sauteed with some butter and garlic. For a change add some chopped up bacon to the pan. Grilling the vegetables is also good. I dont like certain things based on texture but I always try something four times before I decide if I can eat it or not. Thats why I like mushrooms these days I figured out how I like them well done in a fry pan cooked in butter with thyme and how I hate them thick and slimy between the teeth steamedbroiled. If you dont like chewing large pieces of vegetables try grating them instead. Grated carrots cook down to a very soft texture and integrate with the rest of the ingredients well. Grating cauliflower and adding it to a pasta sauce is a good way of introducing more vegetables in your diet. Zucchini grates down really well too. I add all these ingredients to anything Im making with ground beef  pasta sauce meatballs chilli stirfried ground beef. If dealing with large pieces of vegetables cut them in quarters and load your fork with a piece of vegetable and then a piece of pastameat. Keep eating this way  it will take effort! but sticking with it is how new habits are formed. Try things four times and then try them again in moa year. ,recipes,d4e9iz9,1,t5_2qh56

10411067,0,t1_dcnccpw,I have a problem with this recipe.It says  cup Arborio rice per person  and then follows with    cups of chicken stock unsalted kept at a low simmer If one were to follow this as written and used  cups of rice it would seem that the  cups stock does not change because you dont say per person.You should probably edit out the per person bit and add serves x at the end or at the top of the recipe.The ratio of riceliquid that has always worked best for me is  ounces volume rice to  cups stock   cup wine.HTH,recipes,dco5ufe,5,t5_2qh56

10561665,0,t1_dd4mh0i,PointersButtermilk is great for a marinade. You can presoak your tenders in it for awhile in the fridge then remove them and add in your eggs and dip them again. You can also add seasoning to the buttermilk. Its no different than marinating in Greek yogourt.Your tenders are burned. Youre having to cook them too long. Before you do anything with them cut them into smaller halves and then slightly pound them out. Since youre pan frying rather than deep frying you cant cook thick cuts.When youre tossing them with seasoned flour use a paper bag not a plastic bag. That way it wont turn into a gooey sticky mess. With your way it only works a few times before the bag gets all messy. The paper bag will absorb some of the wetness like a sponge.IMO if you marinate the tenders in seasoned buttermilk AND toss them in seasoned flour theyll be much bolder juicier and more tender.,recipes,dd5a8gv,27,t5_2qh56

It often doesnt cook through anything near the bottom turns to mush and you end up with this rice at different stages of cooking like its some sort of art nouveau piece that I dont get. Or it soaks up all of the liquid and leaves you with a ricebased casserole. No I stick to cooking my rice separately and adding it in once done.,recipes,ddajztr,2,t5_2qh56

For chili dogs I take my immersion blender and blend up some of the chili. This makes it nice and saucy perfect for pouring on a hot dog. Top with shredded cheddar.

11431945,0,t3_636k88,if you are pan frying Sauting then you can use broth to deglaze the pan and thicken with a little cornstarch and water slurry after you make sure it tastes like you want.  if baking then scrape everything left on the pan in to a saucepan and do the same thing.  That being said...I am not sure what you mean by crumbled??  do you mean breaded with bread crumbs?  if so then dredge in a little flour or cornstarch for a lighter coating.  season the meat dredge in what ever medium you like then into the hot pan with just enough oil to keep them from sticking badly.  let them brown on side   turn and let them cook just a minute or so if they are true schnitzel cutlets then they will be done already.  remove from the pan and cover to keep warm.  in the pan add  cup chicken broth bring to a boil let simmer while you add seasonings and scrape the Fond bits off the bottom of the pan.  for seasonings I would use garlic powder onion powder maybe some thyme or sage ver small amounts some chicken base if you need the flavor bumped up black pepper etc...  taste and adjust.  the chicken broth will reduce also.  in a small cup add  tablespoons cornstarch to  tablespoons cold water or cold chicken stockbroth.  whisk to incorporate the cornstarch whisking drizzle the cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce slowly dont add all of it at first.  check to see if it is thick enough for you at about half.  then add a little more if need be. etc...  until you get the desired consistency.  Hope this helps you ,recipes,dfrss37,2,t5_2qh56
