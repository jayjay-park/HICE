7541606,0,t3_4igqmb,I agree with Russianbearr. Contact your ELC. I would also talk to your High Pi. Depending on if the High Pi is a direct alum of the chapter he may be able to give the brothers a swift kick in the ass. I know my High Pi didnt graduate from my school but he still has a high level of respect from our brothers. Another option that I can think of and I hate to say this because it makes you seem like you dont want to take on a challenge but depending on how much you like your overall school you could consider transferring. Keep in mind that it is up to the new schools High ZetaExec Committee on whether or not they accept you into the chaptercolony.This last option is quite the stretch but bear with me. Suggest to your chapter to host Conclave in the Spring. Form a largeish committee that gets people involved. Assign tasks set deadlines. You never know it could get people excited and that excitement could bleed over into recruitment.Speaking of recruitment its really hit and miss  but you probably know that. At my school we have deferred recruitment freshmen cannot rush until their second semester so its kind of difficult to get guys after theyve already had the fraternity image painted in their minds by the guys who shouldnt have their charters. We faced a tough challenge with recruitment. Beginning with my class the first for the colony after the expansion semester I was the only person in my class. The next two semesters we initiated  and  guys respectively. Then this semester we got  guys. We were graduating more people than we were taking in and this semester was the first time we had positive growth since  years ago.As High Beta this upcoming semester I am implementing Beta Points. Essentially if brothers arent involved in more important aspects of the fraternity such as philanthropy brotherhood functions rit team etc. they dont get to reap the benefits of socials or other fun functions.I know that was a lot and Im sorry. Being on summer break gives me nothing to do..,LambdaChiAlpha,d2zg04p,2,t5_2so9w
