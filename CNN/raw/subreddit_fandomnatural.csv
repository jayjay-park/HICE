484169,0,t1_cfuye6h,I actually have a posithinking interpretation going for that episode in regards to the two storylines. Maybe it was because I knew it was written by Berens who I hold in high regard or maybe its because Im in the camp of fictionissubjectivesoallineedtodotobehappyisfindtheinterpretationthatmakesthisworkgenius. But when I watched it I thought of the separation of plots as intentionalas another tool being used to illustrate this theme of captivity. Almost its own third plot line. Because though the two storylines were physically separated the emotional beats they played out werent. And pretending for a moment that the writer knows that the viewer wants team free will all together the separation actually contributes to each plot line by providing answers. Who is there for you Castiel? gt The Winchesters! Family! How can the brothers stop being stuck in their ways? gt Learn from Cas! Make different choices like Castiel is finally doing! Or just call Cas for some relationship counseling...ughThat these screamed out to me as a viewer without even having to be said was poignant and made it a powerful episode for me.,fandomnatural,cfvaxjg,2,t5_2vl4v

648489,0,t1_cgdz5jh,Yeah I think its just going to be ignored again. Its definitely arguable about whether thats a good or bad thing  realistic or unrealistic. Ive heard points amp case studiesanecdotes from both sides of the spectrum as to the nature of alcoholism as a symptom a disease or both. The writers def have the option to portray Deans drinking as a symptom of the stress Deans undergoing so once the stress is relieved Deanll bounce back amp reduce swig frequency. Or they could really lay into a physical amp emotional dependency on alcohol for Dean. Personally I think thatd kinda suck though theres nothing supernatural about alcoholism and this is a scififantasyhorror tv show. While there are great spoton parallels this show still isnt a character study on someone grappling with something as mundane and natural as substance abuse.,fandomnatural,cgdzew7,1,t5_2vl4v

Basically it just had to restart the entire episode over right from the beginning  minutes in. Not only did it kill a solid first start but it completely lost whatever momentum it had created in the first place.Then instead of the father being the lead we got the  year old bizarrely nave and screamy for a girl growing up in that environment who wasnt a strong enough character to own the show or an actress who was up to the challenge.I heard S got much better by killing offdownplaying a lot of the worst issues but by then most people had tuned out.,fandomnatural,ch1v9m2,3,t5_2vl4v

871983,0,t1_ch3bxqj,Yknow... I think the difference between loving someone and being controllingpossessive of someone is kind of difficult to nail down when it comes to life or death.Personally itd take a hell of a lot of time for someone I love to convince me they were totally at peace  even wanted  to die. Id think they were scrambling their desires that in fact they actually just wanted to live a different better life which I would then promise to help them get.Itd take even more time for them to convince me that they werent in need of serious psychiatric services. Even more time to convince me that letting them die would be an act of love. Ive often only understood in cases where the loved one is in a constant state of pain amp undeniably terminal no natural or supernatural solutions exist.Classic gestures of love are taking care of the person making sure theyre healthy and safe. Its very rare that people associate love with letting someone die.To ask someone like Dean to recognize and honor Sams death wish within the time frame he was given is I think asking too much. He was only working off his knee jerk imperative to save his brother something hes been counted on for by Sam throughout his entire life. Personally I probably wouldve made the decision Dean made thinking of my brother as a survivor  someone who fights to stay alive for his brother and the innocent lives hell save. If Sam told me he was ready to die Id think something was wonky  that Sam was being influenced by something evil. Because only something evil would want Sam dead and out of the ring so to speak.Dean mightve been doing it for controllingpossessive reasons... but ultimately I can see the same decisions being made for loving reasons. He just wants Sam to live because he loves Sam. Simple. If Sam hates him for what he does never wants to see Dean again etc... I can see Dean nodding along understanding the consequences of what hed done. ...But he wouldnt regret them.Hed rather Sam alive healthy doing well for himself in whatever he wants to do whether its to continue hunting or go back to school forging functional relationships in the world and dropping the toxic ones he perceives  such as the one he has with Dean than dead.And thats... legitimate I feel like....This reminds me of the dilemma with House where his wife saved his life by contradicting his explicit medical orders after hed passed out. He woke up alive and divorced her... And she was totally cool with it  shed been willing to forfeit their relationship they were madly in love for his life.shrug I think thats so selfless that it qualifies as love not possessive or controlling.,fandomnatural,ch3ecw7,5,t5_2vl4v
872616,0,t1_ch3ge1o,I think you are a bit too hard on Dean. If hed had more time to think things through the outcome would have been different like in the season  finale. But he had half a season of Sams I want to live vs.  seconds of I want to die and I cant honestly be sure I wouldve reacted differently under such an immense pressure. And saying something is one thing meaning it quite another. Sam also said he only wants to be business partners anymore but his worry about Dean shows me something different. And he does worry dont know why so many people cant see that. So personally I dont need big declaration. I see both boys viewpoint and I feel they are both validated. Sometimes theres just no black and white just a whole lot of grey. ,fandomnatural,ch3gy0w,3,t5_2vl4v

This would be a severalyear project though because it would require an entire other books at the beginning to set up the whole worldview and mythos. A la Dresden Files. Ive thought about Dresden Files Jim Butchers books not the show as a potential model actually especially since his first couple books were not all that well written and he hadnt yet found his feet as a writer yet. So that gives me hope that maybe I could improve the way Butcher has! Ive also thought of mimicking his plot structure for individual books.

Just people who figure out a decent writing style and then just stop exploring or growing up or realize that theres far more styles and people out there beyond sad little tragedies of the middle class where  nothing really bad ever happens so they have to create drama to give their lives meaning and excitement. But they package it in metaphor and decent writing so it gets way over conflated with actual good writing.God forbid they have to read something that doesnt conform to their delicate sensibilities have something really poop happen and have a little genre in their lives that isnt packaged and bubble wrapped as magical realism.,fandomnatural,cl4vkjb,3,t5_2vl4v

I kind of... liked it. I think maybe the actors of the same character for going on ten full years  if they didnt feel like they knew their characters better than anyone else in the world Id think something was wrong.Literally all creative people have to navigate that rough line between Im a fucking genius and no no Im so humble. On the one hand you need the former in order to maintain tenacious confidence amp reach the creative potential you just know you have. Basically  if youre not an arrogant prick in your own head about the genius of your own creative pursuits youre doing it wrong. Im saying this harshly being an arrogant prick about your work  believing in yourself if you want to be nice amp inspiring. But ultimately I think its the same thing.On the other hand nobody likes to compliment an already massively inflated ego. Saying outright that you DO KNOW  your character better than anyone in the world can lead to a group response of indignation amp a feeling like you just dont want to fan the flames of someones obnoxious selfpraise.Personally whenever a creative professional gets caught saying Im fucking awesome or anything along those lines I kinda like it.

Instead he gives so little resolution to plotlines amp characters just in case theyll need them as the most transparent deus ex machinas... and it sucks.

And quite a few moments in between where it becomes clear that Cas is fiercely protective of the Winchesters and regards himself as their guardian.BTW you have . listed as . on the graphs. Took me a while to figure out how a shapeshifterbaby episode that doesnt even have Cas in it would have converted so many people to Destiel! I was thinking did the the scene at the end where Dean left Lisa somehow make people think he was leaving her for Cas? So I went and developed this whole theory that Lisa knew Dean was bi and figured out that shes not quite doing it for him and that she said something that conveyed all this and everybody picked up on it but me.... then finally thought wait wait . not . ohhhh okay. ,fandomnatural,co54jly,9,t5_2vl4v

2975702,0,t1_co6byih,No worries lets address your concerns together.  There is no issue about me allowing you to exists. There is nothing about that at all. You do however have a different goal. Believe me I did my homework. I researched your sub. You are much more lighthearted and less focused than a normal TV subreddit tends to be to maintain order. Go look at the subs for The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones. Those subs want to be focused on thoughtful discussion and news for the shows they represent. That is what I want. Fanfiction has its place elsewhere. That is why smaller subs like this exists. No reason you cannot have a more serious sub and a more lighthearted one coexisting.  Fanfictionshipping On your front page I count  out of  threads that are related to that and then another  moderator posts.  threads that are not directly related to the show. That is over  of the front page consisting of what I would consider fluff. No big deal it happens but it needs to be controlled. That is why you have multiple moderators. They keep the fluff to a minimum and enforce the policies of the sub. That is how these things work.  LBGT fangirls etc I have to seriously ask where did this concern come from? I dont care if you are gay straight otherkin male female angel demon or even a damn reaper. I never made any statement or even had anything that could be interpreted as otherwise.  You can be a Carebear all you want and preach love respect and whatever I honestly do not care because being respectful is normal. Why should I have to advocate something that is normal? All I will say is dont be a dick to people and that should suffice. You are free to come enjoy the sub. Or not. That is completely up to you. I cannot force anything on you. I have been around the other sub for at least the last . season and I have seen how Nicks ran things this was just the breaking point. You need stop looking for issues where there are none man. I seriously have no intention other than having a place where we fans can have discussions about the show and have episode threads put up in a timely manner without us having to worry about them happening at the last second. I love episode discussion threads. They are part of the experience. You can be at home possibly by yourself and still interact with fans around the world who are watching the show at the same time as you. That stuff is amazing. While I understand your passion and appreciate it because I care about the show and fandom the same as you I just think you are seeing something that is not there and looking to find fault with something that is meant to be good and to help out the community. If you have any other issues feel free to say something. I am always willing to discuss things.,fandomnatural,co6cq30,6,t5_2vl4v
2982905,0,t1_co6cq30,I hope you know that the term carebear is usually used in a derogatory manner? In case you werent aware. Also the concern is very real about this subject. Im thinking you have never been in a thread that has hit the main page of reddit in regards to SPN. There is always a large subset of people who call anyone who dares to ship any of the boys together insane unstable and crazy to the point where people say they hate the fandom because of it. Im looking around here and seeing a lot of love and support and nothing like people seem to think we all represent. So you ask us where this came from... we have lived it in rsupernatural and we have lived it outside of our subs. Wed like to know wed be welcome and not treated like crazy obsessed fans who have no place among all you normal better fans.You are about to start a subreddit that may get people in it that know nothing of fandomnatural. How are you going to treat them? Thats a very valid concern. From your responses in this thread you have pretty much told that section of people that your sub is only about serious conversation and totally dismissed a large section of our community.Here are some facts for you. Tumblr has  MILLION users. Most people on reddit seem to discount tumblr but I have seen some of the deepest and most heartfelt posts about the show on that medium. Here is a post about the most reblogged posts in . Guess what TV show is the most blogged about? Guess what most of those users feel about reddit? Yeah they dont like it because they dont feel welcome. At all. So if you want to replace the main sub and want it to be successful you have to stop discounting these people. If they dont feel welcomed there they arent going to participate in the serious threads. Also I get the feeling that you think that fanfiction is just this tiny part of the fandom. On this website there are  stories about Supernatural and its tv show that has the most stories written about it. On fanfiction.net it is  and has K stories. So at the end of the day by telling people this isnt welcome and that you dont want people to talk about those things you are discounting a HUGE amount of people. Guess what is gonna happen? You are gonna see a lot of people who love fandomnatural in your new sub telling people to come over here because we welcome serious discussion and the fluff as you put it. Look lets get real here. You will control the content on the sub by choosing what weekly participation threads you post what kind of fandom discussions you foster and in general where you and the other mods choose to participate. No one here is asking you to do what we do here with the fanfiction threads. We just want to know that if someone makes their way to the new sub and wants to talk about their otp or shipping that members arent going to shut them down and tell them to move along that shippers and ff writers and the like arent welcome here.,fandomnatural,co767l9,8,t5_2vl4v

Actually I think Tahmoh is the only other actor other than Misha to have really nailed the angelsarenothuman aspect of angels. Tahmoh was also on Dollhouse btw. Fun fact he was born in Whitehorse Yukon and is half native I believe Athabascan? and his dad was the premier of the Yukon. I would love to talk to him about what its like to go from Whitehorse which Ive been to several times on my way to Alaska and omg it is the absolute end of the world to major broadcast tv. Even just Vancouver is like  times more franticurbanmodern than Whitehorse.Fun fact in BSG he was one of those Misha Collins stories where his character had only been planned to make a few brief appearances but the fans fell in love with him and they decided to keep the character around. Theres a moment on the directors commentary where they go aaaaand HERE is where we suddenly knew Tahmoh was gonna stay.

3210740,0,t1_counanv,Its an unwritten rule in the sense that concrit seems to be very rare on the two biggest fanfic sites. Rare enough that it can be very jolting. So for example looks at inbox OK here over the last  days here I have  comments and over  kudos from AO I deleted some of the daily kudosupdates so I dont have an exact count on kudos but there were  yesterday and that was about typical and another  reviews and approx  favoritesfollows from fanfiction.net. In that batch that week was a grand total of  slightlynegative comment along the lines of Great fic! I noticed this  thing that bugged me a little and  truly negative comments. That was a week when all I posted was an epilogue to an alreadycompleted fic I dont even have an active fic going right now.Anyway that was an unusual week because it included a negative comment at all! I think thats only the second one Ive gotten since New Years? So its certainly rare enough that when a negative comment does come in it is especially jolting and painful because of the rarity  Im never mentally prepared for it because its so rare.

History or something. I guess maybe its different for me because Im female and not antislash and I know a little of how pairings work even if I dont understand them all the time. Maybe its because I didnt delve into the toxic bullshit on Tumblr and I still havent except for the few times it spills over onto this sub. But his rant does come off as snowflaking.

3967085,0,t3_35wg14,So just as a warning Im not as positive of a fan as you all are. My sister is constantly annoyed with my pessimism about this show. She is much more like you all. The only time Ive seen you all legitimately mad was last week when Charlie died which was an incredibly stupid episode. I for one cant say Im surprised or mad shes gone but the way she went was utterly idiotic. The shows writers constantly have characters act out f whack to create drama and advance the story. This show and Arrow have a terrible knack for this.As for this episode I was pleasantly surprised! I havent been enjoying most of the episodes lately and last week was worse than the rest. But this week Dean not only kicked ass but cracked my ass up! His fed up dialogue with Sam not only made me laugh due to its blunt nature but also drove home how pissed he was and rightfully so! Only problem is that this is pretty hypocritical from when Kevin died which was entirely Deans fault. Im quite confused as to how Dean broke through the restraints at the Styne house but the fact that he killed them all gave me a hearty laugh. While Charlies death was forced and stupid Im actually glad it happened because it made for a finally interesting episode! Dean actually killed them all! Whoo! The show follows through on promises! And dealt with an annoying enemy that I thought was introduced extremely late into the season. One that would as a result spill over into next season. And Dean fighting Cas! I was honestly hoping it would happen. It would make for an actually decent story! I reminded my sister that Dean has always been somewhat ruthless exemplified by the time he killed Sams old love interest the one who killed her own mother and was a monster herself. I totally believed that Dean could bring himself to kill that kid by being on the path he was on. I almost thought Dean was going to kill Cas! For once in a long time I was scared for a character. Thank goodness that didnt happen though because I need Cas for my plan for next season. I was not however scared for Crowley. While at first I questioned Sams resolve to kill him I figured he wouldnt bite the bullet in the end should Sam actually go through with it. Now I know that the show is scheduled for an th season and you might not like this decision but I hope it ends there. Not many shows can make it as far as Supernatural has without going to the dogs and to me this show has definitely lowered in quality but is not in the darkest reaches of Hell yet. It is my hope that Crowley and Dean become buddy buddy again but this time as an actual lethal pair countered by Sam and Cas. The way I would prefer this show to end is for Dean and Crowley to be locked in Hell because Sam closed the gates leading to his death and he and Cas cashing out and broing down in heaven. To me this seems like the best ending. The key to this however is to set up the framework for the next season in next weeks episode but actually do it well and create a cohesive plot idea. Then the plot will need to be executed diligently with hardly any fillers.Obviously when you have  episodes filler will happen. So I would hope that we get no more than  filler episodes for each team SampampampC and DampampampCr. And those episodes would be filled with hunting by Sam ampampamp Cas and Hell stuff for Dean ampampamp Crowley. The rest  episodes must be plot driven. I want this to be the last season and it has to be good. No How I Met Your Mother bullshit no stupid twists and stop making everyone redeemable. Please a great ending would Deans downfall. Please. Please. Please. ,fandomnatural,cr8hckk,11,t5_2vl4v

3991005,0,t3_365ts5,First thanks ujojodacrow for making this thread! It can be very cathartic to share these things and it just goes to show how awesome and supportive the people here are I was diagnosed with depression when I was  and then with general anxiety disorder when I was  although how my anxiety was missed during my initial diagnosis well never know. I take medication now for my anxiety and without it Im not sure how I would be able to function properly. Its still a challenge every day to deal with these things especially after I took a job that moved me away from my family and friends to somewhere very isolated. Watching Supernatural helps me escape my own head for a while when I am having bad days.I think the AlwaysKeepFighting campaign is awesome. Even now when people are talking more openly about mental illness and companies like Bell have their BellLetsTalk campaign which I tweet the shit out of there is still a huge amount of stigma surrounding the subject. Its still hard for people to admit that theyre living with mental illness and in turn people find it difficult to receive help. Keeping up the conversation and bringing attention to it is only going to help people. So mad mad props to Jared for this.,fandomnatural,crb7iun,12,t5_2vl4v

They said it didnt matter he was gay etc...Though the poodle scene did offer up plenty of vitriol down the road and was basically saying it was homophobic without calling it that.Also Im remembering that while Berens didnt get called homophobic he got called a rape apologist. ,fandomnatural,crj1e8w,2,t5_2vl4v

Which sucks because I know there are so many good stories that overlap with the trope. Its really disappointing to find an interesting summary and then see ABO in the tags because it just instantly kills it and I cant read it. Its really weird though because in other circumstances I really like domsub stuff. I think its just because in a few early ABO things I read there was this trend of omegas are born into a life of being sex slaves to alphas or whatever which just nah nope not happening nada nein. Although its funny that this comes from Teen Wolf and doesnt really have the fic implications. Do you watch the show? Does anyone here watch the show?

4777878,0,t3_3g7aom,I have super mixed feelings about Charlie. I wanted to like her because Felicia Day and lesbian nerd representation but something about her really did bug the crap outta me and I found the same to be true of Kevin to a lesser extent. In one of the past discussions I cant remember which or find it on mobile sorry someone pointed out that a lot of it seems to boil down to her their context.The majority of episodes Charlie was in were ridiculous. Its hard to take any character seriously when their entire stage is limited to contrived setups bad scripts and a bunch of misjudged attempts at jokes. Theres nothing wrong with some tensionrelieving humorous moments in a show that runs as long as Supernatural but all the other main type characters we got attached to  the Winchesters Bobby the Harvelles Castiel  had a chance to establish themselves as meaningful and multifaceted before getting involved in little inside jokes with winks directed at the fourth wall.With a character like Garth you kind of got the same but he fit in that roll. He was goofy and a little inept and talked with a sock puppet. Charlie on the other hand we were suddenly supposed to take seriously with no buildup.The instabadassbecausewesaidso is an issue I had with Cole too but thats a separate rant.,fandomnatural,ctwsk4w,2,t5_2vl4v

4800405,0,t1_ctzhany,I dunno. Sam gave up pretty easily when he thought Dean was in hell. He tried for like a couple of months? then give up. Im sure Death can send him further this time. If anybody he should worry about its Castiel who has the power of searching through the entire universe. So the logic about getting Sam over to kill him was quite out for me. I would have liked if Death had made that request as a bargain. Actually his whole logic was silly to me. Please forgive me if I remembered this part wrong. But he could have come and said Im indifferent to the darkness I dont have to help you. That explained why I didnt come looking for you as soon as I heard you had the mark. So since youre begging me here kill your bro for me cause he always causes trouble for me and I dont like his hair.And even if Sam has to be brought over to be killed I would think the first thing Sam would do upon hearing about the true meaning of the Mark is to call the guys to stop the spell. At that point Rowena would probably force them to continue because of her own agenda. But at least it would show that Sam thought about people what they were doing to the people of the world. Too bad they didnt. Instead it was a silly speech of Sam assuring Dean he was good. How ironic.,fandomnatural,ctzmpri,3,t5_2vl4v
4800706,0,t1_ctznfo8,Ha Im the second bornyoungest kid. My brother is  years older then me and around the time I started having memories he didnt live at home any more due to school. He went to a special school for the blind. So i was also basically raised as an only kid.But from the time I was about  I some how ended being the person in the family where is an older relative wasnt feeling well I would get sent to lend them a hand. Because I was the well behaved obedient child in the family. I mean at  i wasnt taking full care of any one obviously but like with just helping with things here and there and as i got older that responsibility became more.I can not tell you how much of a relief it is my brother no longer lives in this state and thus I m not responsible in my head to help him any morehe has other health issues outside of his eyes . A few months back he tried talking me in to coming out there to help him when he has his next eye sugary .... Oh dear god that about sent me in to a panic attack and then even still telling him nowhich i didnt just straight up tell him no i gave excuses on why i couldnt still stressed me outAnd now with my mother her health is going down hill. Im still here helping her. But really when i look at that and apply it to my future I see Hell.  Im not even kidding there. IF some things go with how i think it will i know me i know I cant deal with it. And no one is listening to me with this. I am trying so hard to get shit together now and move out and separate my self from this to some degree. Even still i dont feel comfortable going further then some of the apartments that are nearyby. Because if i am to far away something will happen. Yeah im a bit of a wreck..ehBut with all that pressure on you that why sometime Its nice to let go and let some one else take control some one you can trust. I think thats why i hover to the type of fics that i do.I just want to say in general i dont mind helping out people and taking care of them but I have been told im not good at babying people and i can be a bit cold even when i am making an effort not to be when i am dealing with some one who is sick lol. Also i think this whole thing plays in to why I dont want kids and an idea of a partner kinda turns me off i dont feel like having the obligation of taking care of anyone anymore.

I loved the opening with Chucks monologue.I thought the camera closeness was distracting at first but it really gave a realness to their heart to heart before sleeping.The close quarters fight scenes were impeccable and so intense. Chopping the guys head off with the door was awesome.Poor baby. I love it that he praises her with theres my girl when she starts after such a horrible day. I hope we get to see some of the restoration ahead.Cas watching OitNB or Netflix in general is adorable and Im glad hes getting a little down time. The boys need to go home and get some sleep as well after this.In my opinion after Matts appearance we will definitely see Lucy Michael and God this season and hopefully sooner than later so we can see them all work together. Ive been saying this over and over but I have been waiting for them to go back to the cage for years and years and God entering the dynamic is just an icing on the cake especially if he comes as Chuck.All in all I loved every second of it and they did a great job at giving us an in depth look at something we truly havent seen before.,fandomnatural,cwguxf0,11,t5_2vl4v

7679453,0,t1_d3ejowy,When I became a homeowner I discovered there is nothing illegal about finding someones address and sending them stuff in the mail. Turns out yhere are companies whose entire business model is to comb real estate tax records for new homeowners so as to barrage them with ads for gutter repair and carpet cleaning lol. So addresses of homeowners at least are public knowledge. I think theres an interesting clash here between a very modern online culture that assumes a right to anonymity and that tends to view any attempt to find out personal info as stalking vs an older legal framework that assumed everybodys full name address amp phone number was public information. I mean till very recently your phone  and full street address would be in the phone book full paper copies of which were distributed annually to literally every home in the entire city  information doesnt get much more public than that!

7680464,0,t1_d3exfgz,After reading through stuff Im like  sure this is accurate. Ill look for sources...So if TAW files lawsuits against these individuals then theres no way these individualsfans can join together to fight him. They are the defendant hes called out individually and hes the plaintiff. And the lawsuit is only ever between him and that individual hes identified as suing.What the fans can do I think is join together turn around and hit him with their own lawsuit against him making them the plaintiff and him the defendant. In that case it would be in California by the same defendant personal jurisdiction requirement TAW lives in Cali.Looking around Im only finding info on Joinders lol but Joinders for civil law cases only allows you to bring a bunch more legal issues against the defendent by the plaintiff or it allows more parties to join the plaintiff. So yeah. So far I dont think you can legit just randomly join together as defendants. You have to join together by becoming plaintiffs together we could look into the term class action  seems like it might be relevant but idk wtf it is hahaha... and ps is no one else really going to actually look this stuff up on the internet with me?,fandomnatural,d3f80rw,3,t5_2vl4v

Against all expectations there was season eight. There were the alphas and purgatory and then the Leviathans and then the angels fell. Enter season nine. Loose threads Metatron Abaddon and Crowley have to be tied up. Sam Dean and Cas have to try to tie them while at the same time dealing with their evolving relationships and newfound graceless states.Amidst all the chaos someone has started publishing the Supernatural novels again. Convinced theres something amiss in the pages Charlie starts her own quest to suss out the truth behind the Winchester Gospels.With the help of various faces old and new they must now not only deal with the typical runs of demons and recently fallen angels but also reconcile the battles raging inside themselves as the fate of the world once again quite literally lays in the palm of their hands.This is from  so not exactly new but I really like its approach to meta and the continuity with the series is honestly better than Supernaturals continuity with itself.

Hes the playwright that said his theater production Octopus is primarily a play about sea monsters and what it means to say I love you so I think he fits perfectly into Supernaturals primary motivations lol.Next the synopsis premise is selling this episode a lot better than the promo. The promo made this episode look like your average stuckinahauntedhouse situation with a couple supporting female characters present to marginally spice things up. The idea of hunters gathering together to commemorate the death of another is poignant amp super reasonablerelevant as an activity and could tie into the BMoL really nicely if theyre being tracked by Mr. Ketch whose entire mission is to find the American hunter network. Then the concept of hunters getting hunted? Nice  I like it. The only thing closest to it weve ever gotten was monsters with personal vendettas against specific hunters not a monster or monsters that actively seek out and target hunters altogether. So yeah!

11167929,0,t1_dexuayi,I totally understand what you said about shutting this topic down now. But I cant help but wanting to  jump in at what you said about ships. And this has to be relevant D because its got characters names all over it! I personally prefers gen friendship stories more than anything but therere just too many good destiel writers I still have not given wincest a try but Im sure therere just as many out there that just provide so much material that is too good for me to miss. And I kind of think that many writers use destiel except for the steaming hot scenes as an outlet for a friendship that is so epic thats unrivaled by anything else which in many cases equates to romantic love. And I do like Samstiel is it Sastiel? I was just watching a jibcon video and I thought one fan was saying sastiel. Or maybe she said Samstiel and I didnt get it due to her accent. They have a very different dynamic than destiel. There is a thread on Deans topic I was going to jump into which said Dean in fanfic sometimes is very different from Dean in the show. And I tend to agree. Many times Dean in fanfic would actually act like Sam from the show again with hundreds of episodes and so many cast and crew involved there are going to be inconsistencies even in cannon. And even though Im not totally a sucker for underdog I do like the idea that SamCas relationship is more of an evolved one than DealCas which seemed to have respect and appreciation from both sides pretty close to  right from the start.,fandomnatural,dexvftm,1,t5_2vl4v
