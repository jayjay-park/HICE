11194311,0,t1_df0uwmp,Devs want to make lowend pc have  fps on low settings on final release.I think RX  will work great after few months of optimization.,Battlegrounds,df0v19p,2,t5_2wsmh
11294020,0,t3_616438,Ive played about  games today and only had a problem with one where it was lagging pretty bad and I was bouncing all over the place. Can get some drops to under fps in a built up area Ive only put foliage and shadows on medium with everything else high running an ik and . Averaging  fps. So I mean really its pretty good for something thats only been out  day.,Battlegrounds,dfc5t2h,2,t5_2wsmh
11321372,0,t3_61keiz,I have the gtx  fx  gb ram. Get about  fpsThe game is cpu intensive though so with your i you should be good with  fps stable on very low also this has been the first game where I dont care about graphics Im so immersed in the gameplay that I dont care,Battlegrounds,dff9bdw,1,t5_2wsmh

11325191,1,t1_dffhmx7,Still saying that about dayz arent they? I mean things have been going well so far imo but we probably shouldnt just assume things will get better quickly. Might have to live with a little lag and some bugs for a while.,Battlegrounds,dffowt3,-2,t5_2wsmh

11372145,0,t1_dfkys2p,Like the first person who responded to you said Its due to how the game is optimized. Some CPUGPUs are just going to be better at running the game due to how their architecture and the games programming interact. It sucks but thats just how it is right now. On the bright side the devs have stated that its going to be one of the first things theyre going to be tackling I think the first big optimization update is scheduled for  weeks from now. Theyre also going to be releasing server optimizations every daily which should help with rubber banding. You can read all about their roadmap hereBiggest takeaway be patient. You bought an early access game. Its not finished yet. You acknowledged this when you first fired it up. It wont be a polished product until sometime this summer. In the meantime try and find settings that work with what you have Ive that for me shadows foilage and post processing are the biggest factors. ,Battlegrounds,dfl0f85,1,t5_2wsmh
11374844,0,t1_dfl02id,Reporting system probably. Perhaps they can read vicinity. Spend too much time next to someone from another team without any damage done on top of being reported can get you banned.,Battlegrounds,dflbhph,3,t5_2wsmh
11375420,0,t1_dfkbtpt,Both of those could be due to a bug where houses and building temporarily appear invisible to people who can also shoot at people who normally are behind a wall of the house. The devs are planning on fixing it soon but keep this in mind until then.,Battlegrounds,dfldupw,2,t5_2wsmh
11437857,0,t1_dfsgket,Thanks dude. Its got a steeper learning curve than other programs but it earns its pricetag when it comes to more complex stuff. Im lucky since my dad works in the film industry he went ahead and installed it on my computer for me. Otherwise its insanely expensive. I hear Vegas is pretty good for just video editing Adobe CS really only starts to shine when you get into after effects and using the whole suite together. ,Battlegrounds,dfsgxoc,1,t5_2wsmh
11446711,0,t1_dftfgil,they save during that session but every time i close the game all of the settings will be back to the default next time i play. i dont know what write protected the configuration files means but i havent modified anything outside of the settings that are ingame except for the fov changes.,Battlegrounds,dfth3l3,1,t5_2wsmh

I havent heard or seen anyone with your problem so Im not sure what to do  Sorry man.,Battlegrounds,dg9mxbo,1,t5_2wsmh
