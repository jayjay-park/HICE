You wont believe how much is the mark up for the flowers the florist are charging you.Recently we are branching out to sell organic and chemical fertilizer. I am in charge of purchase and quality control. I also head out to the fields to see the progress of our products and talk to sales. Basically a do all kinda guy. Lol. Im sorry I cant tell you what products I am selling because I fear you will know what company I represent but  I can disclose that we are a new upcoming company in the agriculture department. We are good enough to create ripples for the already big giants because we have an aggressive by that I mean cheap sales point. If you are in the industry you would have heard us protect your rice paddy fields and onions and corn.The biz I believe has a lot of potential and if you want to start in it and have questions I hope to be able to answer them. And if you are already a farmer maybe you can give us a try! Cheers.,indonesia,cfaupg1,1,t5_2qkte

343603,0,t1_cfg576p,Yup I heard this rumour too! From my mother. . I think he is a bad man. He seems to be mentally unstable. I heard another rumour that when his father was in his deathbed Prabowo slapped him around and asked him not to die until he becomes President. So to me the reason why he is bad is because he seems to be mentally unstable.. I personally would not vote for him. But maybe other people would.PS. If you wonder why so much about Prabowo seems to be rumour thats because most of his career was under the authoritarian regime of Suharto. In authoritarian regime rumours are the only info you have since you cannot always trust official sources.

SEATO was a separate organization and had nothing to do with ASEAN. On the Indonesian side ASEAN was more of a way to set aside all those rivalry and tension with neighbours caused by Sukarnos Great Power aspiration. For the other members ASEAN back then was a way to contain Indonesia. I actually think ASEAN has been a great success in reducing tension between Southeast Asian nations. Therefore it causes stability which leads to decades of high economic growth. Now it is practically the only multilateral organization in Asia that can act as backbone for further regional cooperation. For example we have ASEAN we have ASEANEU forum. Compare this successess to the situation in South Asia. They have their ASEAN equivalent which they call SAARC. It is a failure compare to ASEAN. It doesnt promote stability it doesnt promote high economic growth it doesnt even generate a feeling of community. The economic growth in India is not really caused by the stability from SAARC.,indonesia,cfklj0e,1,t5_2qkte

The problem is that clusterfuck of a coalition he has. PKS couldnt even decide which side theyre on at times and dont forget all the corruption.You can say decisive as much times as you want throw them into the bureaucracy and theyll give up. Thats why Jokowi is the most logical option if he can handle Jakartas corruption and ineffeciency he can handle Indonesias.Giving that to Prabowo is like giving the directors seat of a blockbuster Hollywood movie to some unknown film school student.

We at this point do not know how decent or bad the aforementioned kos is. You see when I stated the argument of subpar living condition as a hypothetical ground that the student could take when being taken to legal action I assumed if the student got assigned to a bad one and heshe would have a case to defend himherself or to sue back. Im not defending the student but rather pointing out that its not as easy as it taking legal action seems. Again its all assumption and what the Indonesian embassy  sponsor will do would be of no interest to me. But I do wonder what kind of kos the student got though...gt And had the student complained from early on the uni or some local rep of the KBRIministry can arrange for a new alternative accommodation. Yet what did the student do?Again Im not defending what the student did. What can be done and whether it can be done by the embassy  sponsor would be to Lintars knowledge.gt I would rather have the student tell Indonesia as he sees it rather than begging pampering or look the other way at his case in order to make him think that Indonesia is awesome. In the end he is just a drop in the bucket for every single person like him we have thousands of foreign students that came to Indonesia and had a much better experience than what he had.Oh no I dont want to beg nor pamper the student to speak high and nice of Indonesia I just assumed it should be an awesome experience since the student got to visit Bandung Jogja Bali Medan is awesome too actually D. Just that KBRI doesnt need to go full legal action to this case especially when its just a drop in the bucket like you said. Though it would simplify things if they incorporated fines in their contract.Now I actually didnt want to continue the arguments about KBRI vs said student to this length because most of rindo pretty much should be able to see that the fault lies in the student and because the main topic is if PLN is really that bad in Medan... which attracted me to this thread anyway...,indonesia,churntz,1,t5_2qkte

The bad fashion in which Indonesia and the Netherlands parted meant of course a great deal of illwill in Indonesia that did not only make it uncomfortable but downright unsafe for many people to stay. Mixed people were often part of the colonial system because of their Dutch connections.Also I think that a lot of people have at least a few drops of Dutch blood but since it is not something to boast of postindependence I think many families forgot. This is just me speculating though.Wikipedia says there are over four hundred thousand people of Indonesian descent in the Netherlands on a population of  million but doesnt specify how they define that. Many families although less in the North where Im from however have at least one ancestor with connections to Indonesia. We might very well be the most Asian country in Europe in that regard.,indonesia,ci6jrf6,1,t5_2qkte

Im sure people would be interested in trying it. So sounds less stupid and more stubborn that her way to prepare them didnt work. I think she just willfully ignored the instructions.

Jehovah is the one true God Jesus was his first creation biblical references to the Archangel Michael Abaddon Apollyon and the Word all refer to him and the Holy Spirit guides the Governing Body here on Earth. They do not believe in a hell of fiery torment. Instead biblical references to hell Hades and Sheol refer to death and the only hope of resurrection is through following the doctrines of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. They believe that only  will go to heaven and the rest of the faithful will be resurrected to live forever in a paradise on Earth. The Anointed as the  are called are the only ones who partake of the yearly Memorial offering of unleavened bread and wine. They believe that it is their duty to witness to others by going door to door. Field service as it is referred to among members is an important part of their faith and members are expected to devote a minimum number of hours to it each month. They do not celebrate holidays or get involved in politics. Jehovahs Witnesses believe they are supposed to be in the world but not of the world and so reject anything with pagan origins or anything that requires allegiance to a government other than Jehovahs invisible rule with Jesus as its King in heaven.

For what it is worth I do not think we as a group are currently practicing that. And seriously we can do better.I hate to intervene in the circlejerk I am at fault of being a part of but we are a growing community and we need to start asking ourselves what examples and standards are we setting for the new members and the community as a whole.But then again this is a place where you can post your opinion freely to an extent. I am just trying to appease to those who know better to at least maintain a certain level of decency.I welcome although it have been disproved before in this same sub a fruitful logical and intelligent debate on why I am wrong.I am ranting. And if you feel offended good very good. I am not apologizing I write what I post for a reason that I can morally justify.EDIT Thank you stranger for the gold.

1757290,0,t3_2ejk20,Been through this. Its just a teenager thang man. Its not even the worst of life. For me it was in middle school not much friends parents at the start of their fight now about to finalise their divorce my bro enjoying his high school life and not paying attention to me a total nerd the whole nine yard. Considered suicide many times to make a statement of how stressful student life is cause Im an edgy kid. But then I thought besides my mom and other close family and friends no one would really give a shit. Even if they see the news of a kid commiting suicide because of stress or whatever theyll just say oh thats a shamethats so sad and go on with their daily lives. Lets face it Indonesia doesnt see emotionalmental problems in high regards. Most people would tell introverted depressed and schizophrenic people to just get over it and dont understand that its a serious mental problem.Thankfully high school was better for me. Met the best group of friends Ive ever known got real close with some girls didnt really hit it off with any of them which I fucking regret C Im sorry I was a dense fuck. Youre beautiful outgoing and nice and I totally regret being a douche pickle who didnt see that back then I dont deserve you and you deserve better end rant and generally got a little more outgoing and happy in general. Point is life goes on. And now Im lucky enough to attend college in the US and Im feeling better than ever. Working even part time sucks hard. Even worse than school works that I thought was the worst thing in the world just a few years ago. Around finals work  studying really takes a toll on me and I sleep for only  hours a day. Vidya games only on weekends for like  hours. But you just gotta deal with it. Im not stopping you on pussying out and just end it cause Ive really considered it myself sometimes. But the thing that always kept me going is my curiosity for the future. Its not always gonna be rainbows and sunshine but without the bad things the good things wont have any value anyway. ,indonesia,ck0nwjh,3,t5_2qkte

1915432,0,t3_2gjzk8,Yes. No plants should be illegal. Not weed. Not khat. Not mushroom. Especially when they are useful for some medical treatment. But you can regulate them to avoid misuse. Just like you regulate the use of pharmaceutical drugs.The only reason for them to be illegal is because they have always been illegal. And because getting high or drunk is a sin everybody thinks that theres nothing wrong with them being illegal. Except that alcohol is not illegal and getting drunk with alcohol is a personal choice and nobody should drink too much. What those religious people forget is that neither alcohol nor any drugs are illegal during Muhammad or Jesus era. Jaman nabi aja legal bro! Of course our prophet hates them and declared getting drunk is a sin but he as the leader never punished anyone for possessing alcohol or drugs. People that got drunk and steal something got punished. People that cheated with their neighbors wife got punished. But not for owning and using drugs for themselves though it is as sin. As long as you dont mess with other people. Same thing with haram food.It is a personal choice. You are responsible for your own life.kenapa gue jadi ngelantur ya.. and Im not sure if my historical data is accurate. hehe.. jangan terlalu serius ya..pokonya setuju legalisasi!,indonesia,ckjzwbt,0,t5_2qkte
1917700,0,t1_ckk90u1,gt Yes alcohol allows for better creativity but again might be wrong it still ruins your liver slightly  you just consume it less so your liver can recuperate before your next glass of beer.Not if you dont abuse it. In fact studies have shown that a glass of red wine everyday is beneficial for your heart. Google it. gt Personally I dont like alcohol because consuming it would mean youll gradually lose your awareness and losing awareness is stupid in my opinion.You loose awareness when you sleep or when you concentrate deeply in something like in praying or studying. If you meant consciousness then if you get unconscious everytime you drink then youre a chronic alcoholic. Most people are not chronic alcoholic.gt  I just dont see a point in wasting your money to get high  its useless.Playing video games or looking at paintingsart objects are also useless but they are pleasurable.I dont think believe youve ever tried alcohol or any drug.

Look for PATAS ones since they are express and have AC. Also stock up on popmie bottled water instant coffee snacks in nearby minimarkets indomaret alfamart etc. An electric kettle might be handy but perhaps you can just ask for one at the place you are staying in Bromo. Edit  the info above assumes you land in Surabaya. If you land in CGK try getting a plane ticket to there first. Might be a bit pricey. Or you can book AirAsia online from now.

One sunny day he peacefully eating grass while watching a soccer match. It is between Liverpool and Chelsea he does not have any favourite club but he chose to support Liverpool at that match. At half time there is an ad of Pirates of Caribbean. He likes Johnny Depp very much and he likes Caribbean too. He looks for his owner to show him this ad. Too bad it is already finished when the owner came in the living room. He also miss the time of the movie. So PoyoPoyo is a bit sad. But after that the soccer match continues.

I took a few years of standard Indonesian in the university classroom and from there learning nonstandard or colloquial forms was just an extra step. I wouldnt say Im fluent in it but neither is it a different language than what you learn in the classroom. They share the same vocabulary and grammar to a large extent.Besides what you are complaining about is true of any language that has a standard form and colloquial forms. Just how far from the standard the colloquial form is depends on the language social class etc but the difference is almost always there unless the standard form is modeled very closely on a spoken dialect.,indonesia,cnxlzbm,0,t5_2qkte

2967197,0,t3_2u5i4g,Im gonna be honest. You will have a hard time to get a tourist visa. Only you who know about your financial situation and the embassy usually wants to see your bank statement.I will make this short. Whats your real intention to move to the US? Is he going to marry you? The easiest way to solve your problem is of course by having him to marry you and youll get a green card automatically. You can find jobs easier too. But are you just going to find out more about him? One LPT is not to follow someone to a foreign place unless you have a solid plan. If everything falls apart youll be all alone and thousand of miles away from your loved ones.Back on topic you have a better chance to get a student visa by trying to get a scholarship at a bigger university because if you are trying to get into a community college at your age and while already having a bachelor degree the embassy officer will get suspicious on you.FYI tourists visa holders cannot work there. And you cannot work legally outside of school if you have a student visa. However you can work in school eg. cafetaria or library or if you apply for a CPT you can work as an intern in a company outside of school but typically community colleges dont issue CPTs to students. Universities do. Another option is to work under the table but I have no idea how tight the immigration rules are in Hawaii.The following rule of thumb applies unless you want to apply a fiance visa when you are being interviewed never say that you intend to stay in the US permanently.If you fail in the interview and get blacklisted your chance to apply for a visa is even slimmer.Edit clarity,indonesia,co5dw2g,5,t5_2qkte

Apparently if youre from South Africa you have to take English test! This doesnt apply to British American Irish Canadian or NZ applicant.I think youre right that there are many ethnic groups in SA and maybe not all of them speak English at home. They have Afrikaners who are descendants of Dutch farmers. Some of these people still speak their own language a dialect of  Dutch at home. Of course in SA they also have XhosaZulu people who have their own languages as well.So maybe both Indonesian government and Australian government concludes that SA cannot be considered an Englishspeaking nation because their various ethnic groups do not necessarily speak English at home.,indonesia,cood9ow,2,t5_2qkte

3174476,0,t1_cop0y7u,Dalam menluis  post ini sebenarnya menerut saya saya sudah sopan. . Sebenarnya Saya berasal dari Singapura tahun  adalah pertama saya berkunjung di Indonesia. Waktu Mei   saya  misah di Jakarta.  Saya juga pernah ke Timtim waktu kejajahan Indonesia. Dan pernah menjadi tersangka di Mabes POLRI..  Menurut kalian pengalaman saya di Indonesia cukup atau tidak?Sebenarnya ada banyak hal yang bisa belajar dari  Orde Baru atau Orde Lama. Di Indonesia Agama dan Budayasangat terikat dengan Politik.  Dari jaman VOC sampai sekerang. Di jaman VOC orang di pulau jawa dipaksa ikut agama Islam atau Kristen.  Agama Sunda Wiwitan adalah respons dari sebagian orang Sunda yang melawan kebijakan VOC.Seperti Prabowo banyak orang bilang dia produk orde Baru tetapi ibunya Kristen dan Ayah Muslim adiknya Kristen. Kalau jaman sekarang berhubungan seperti itu lebih jarang. Benny Moerdani mantan Menteri Pertahanan dan Panglima ABRI Katolik ibunya Katolik dan ayahnya Islam. Kenapa jaman dahulu orangnya bisa menikah secara resmi dan istri tetap Agama A dan suami tetap Agama B.? Kenapa ada Batak Karo ikut agama Hindu? Atau orang Dayak ikut agama Hindu?   Kenapa sebagaian Batak Karo Hindu sebarnyanya mereka bukan Hindu tetapi karena waktu tahun   diresmikan ada  Agama resmi  Islam  Kristen Hindu dan Katolik.  Agama  resmi dapat lebih banyak fasilitas.   Indonesia kirim pendata dari Bali untuk menajar agama Hindu. Di Bali sendiri agama sejak  dimodifikasi supaya susuai dengan Pancasila Ketuhanan Yang Maha Esa.Tan Malaka orang Padang tetapi dia orang Komunis. Apakah orang Minang jaman sekerang angkat dia sebagai pahlawan orang  Minang? Katakata Minang berdasarkan Islam apakah tokoh Minang seperti Tan Malaka atau Mohammad Hatta akan setuju pikiran sperati itu?  Menurut saya kalimat yang paling menyakiti Bangsa Indonesia adalah Ketuhanan Yang Maha Esa Kalimat itu adalah kompromi tokohtokoh nasionalis dan tokohtokoh islam. Sukarno sendiri  ingin megunakan kata Kepercayaan. Waktu an Suharto mau masuk kepercayan sebagai agama tetapi organisasi Islam berteriakteriak.  I am going to be switching back to English. Indonesia is political and socially more backward now then she was in the s. There is a limit to how much people like Ahok can change the system because at the end they are products of  theNew Order.  The only public figure who was brave enough to confront the past was Gus Dur and that is one of the reasons why he was impeached.   Gus Dur made efforts to try to rehabilitate the the PKI members and their families.  Had they rest of Indonesian society listened to Gus Dur its most likely the death penalty would have been abolished.  Why is Cambodia the only country in mainland SEA that has abolished the death penalty? The reason is they dealt with the genocide during the Khmer Rouge period. Society was so shocked by the brutality of the Khmer Rouge they dont have the death penalty. Gus Dur was blunt enough to say that the reason why there Christianity grew so rapidly in CentralEast Java because Islam organizationss including NU killed many PKI members. After  when the Indonesian government made it mandatory for people to have a religion many of those Communist and their families became Catholics and Protestant. Minang was also a PKI and Murba an left wing rival of the PKI hotbed.Because of  Indonesia is a sick culture and society.  Anyone who thinks they can understand Indonesia without understanding  and its implications is delusional. The number who died range from  to possibly as high as  Million father in law of SBY who was a chief organizer said  Million were killed most people put it at . Sometimes the truth is so nasty it can shake the foundation in which present day Indonesia is built on so a lie is more suitable. What would happened if  Indonesian listen to Gus Dur in  they would have found out in many of their religious leaders and had participated in the butchering of Communist in .

Perhaps wait until that finishes then you can start thinking to open up another cafe.Or you can take ujokorares advice and sell it as a franchise.

3527253,0,t1_cpubxwg,ampampamp Tulip mania sfw gtgtTulip mania or tulipomania Dutch names include tulpenmanie tulpomanie tulpenwoede tulpengekte and bollengekte was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for bulbs of the recently introduced tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then suddenly collapsed. gtAt the peak of tulip mania in March  some single tulip bulbs sold for more than  times the annual income of a skilled craftsman. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble or economic bubble  although some researchers have noted that the Kipper und Wipperzeit episode in  a Europewide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare featured manialike similarities to a bubble.  The term tulip mania is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble when asset prices deviate from intrinsic values gtThe  event was popularized in  by the book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds written by British journalist Charles Mackay According to Mackay at one point  acres  ha of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb.  Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackays book is a classic his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.  gtgtImage i  A tulip known as the Viceroy displayed in a  Dutch catalog. Its bulb cost between  and  guilders florins depending on size. A skilled craftsman at the time earned about  guilders a year.

So while waiting for the segments I usually listen to podcasts.Their target audience is young adults so the sexual references and double entendres are quite strong. For example they had a dish detergent quiz not too long ago and the answer for the question was kerak. Ronal gave the hints Depannya k belakangnya k tengahnya n.

This was based on outdated ideas of race and it is not accepted in anthropology today.Why even have these two separate definitions of Malay? Of course there would be confusion. Even among Malaysians as you said yourselfgtThats why some peninsular people get confused when you say that you are a Christian bumiputera because you look like a Malay.In part their confusion also comes from ignorance. They need to get over the fact that nonMuslim bumiputeras or perhaps more accurately AustronesiansSoutheast AsiansNusantara people exist.Feeling a kinship with other Austronesians for whatever similarities is fine but why call them Malay when they dont call themselves that?

Using that logic receiving a bribe is also better than nothing.Its about how company trying to make the already free and equal internet to become exlusive for those with large funding.Lets just say now they give access free to site they prefer over time people will take it granted and view those outside internet.org as more expensive alternative lets say vivanews become internet.org member and other alternative news site is outside it most mass will of course get vivanews as their default news outlet and lets suppose the owner of vivanews try to shovel their agenda during lets say election just look what happen in convential media the last time they all controlled by either side A or B.an analogy will be if you and your friend are competing for the position of school presidential committee or something both of you are given a place in a hall to voice your opinion but you have to pay to access and use the building so the only viable choice is to start selling ticket to audience for people to see your speech and idea. But your friend being already rich can pay the access to the building without sharing the price or he made a deal with the building owner to give them free access for him to use the hall. Now by that logic who has better chance of gaining mass to attend the public speech you or your friend?The same can say in business internet is meant as equalizer for all business and startup to grow without getting worried being crushed by already large company massive cash flow. ebay amazon alibaba wont be able to reach today state if the internet at that time is not free or neutral. Now imagine if you start a revolutionized video portal website today that shows a very good prospect and chance. Then suddenly incumbent video streaming company sees this and seize a deal with internet.org to give free access to their site only combined that with the rising price of bandwidth who do you think which site will gain more views?,indonesia,crf0hwz,1,t5_2qkte

4093624,0,t1_crmbvcn,I disagree.  The problem with the JP is that the Jakarta Post is very one sided with its editorials.  Secondly the comments section is dominated by one viewpoint which is secular left wing  islamohobic.  The JP shares the same views as those commentators and they arent going to censor them.  Often the same people can criticize the government for doing A and then criticize the government for doing B.   Then if people try to argue  with them they start accusing people belonging ISIS. I have seen death threats to Jokowi and his family post there and its not removed. Its something that is illegal in many countries even the US. Then there is the use of the word Indon which is a slur its the equivalent of being called Jap  Chink  Gook in the US.The comment section in the JP is worse than the comment section in the Daily Mail. ,indonesia,crmwcr0,5,t5_2qkte

4721321,0,t3_3fl38q,I took the TOEFL IBT a few years ago. Nothing really fancy about it imo. There are  parts to the test. First two are listening and reading which are no different than most english tests Indonesian students may have taken during regular school just answer some questions after reading or listening to a passage. Next is speaking where you are asked to paraphrase some text and answer a question. Last is writing which is the same as the speaking portion only you write some text instead of talking.I guess you could practice a bit for the last two parts if you really want a good score though you can easily get by with decent grammar.

4946819,0,t3_3ikxge,. no clue about that been out of Bandung since  only went back for a couple months last year. After  months you should find a locals that want to hang out with you for language exchange you can visit top universities in Bandung and ask them if you can post an advertisement or something. Id recommend ITB Unpar Maranatha.. Finding a job wouldnt be that hard if you are willing to become a language teacher you can even become English teacher if youre blonde. For English they dont really care about your teaching ability as long as you look like a white guy. There should be some sort of teaching license you should ask around at that institut francais. Check International School first about teaching.. Driver license in Indonesia is all about money just briber the police ask your chinese Indonesian gf to help it will take like k mil rupiah for car license  A license.. Doctors in Indonesia are expensive as fuck I once had to pay . mil rupiah for  check up and  small bottle for mild bronchitis medicine. Id suggest work out moderately to avoid getting sick so you build your immune system. As for general ilness like common cold and such nearby Istana Plaza at Pajajaran road there is this famous doctor named lan ce ciaw or something he opens in the morning.General sum of road bribes is kk tell them you want to damai means peace. dunno about papua visa and why the hell you want to go there anyway no map on angkot just use google map.P.S as a guy living in another country i totally get your problem if you got some question about bandung just ask me in PM.,indonesia,cui34iu,2,t5_2qkte

Here is a complete explanation from the Indonesian DPR as controversy emerged after the delegates met Donald Trump a US presidential hopeful.The visit of DPR leadership is an official business as a response to the invitation of IPU Speakers Conference Inter Parliamentary Union that is the fourth international conference of parliamentary heads between August  to September .

The meeting was done at the th floor of Trump Plaza. After then the delegation was asked to go to the ground floor for a press conference. As polite easterners such invitation was thus accepted. This is definitely not a political support she reiterated.Here is a complete explanation of Nurul Arifin representing the Indonesian DPR delegates to the United States.

5574234,0,t1_cwnze33,Look there is no requirement to honor in TPP agreement as valid patents that were registered in one TPP partner country. There is no requirement to have unified patent application at all. So patents are to be applied to each country separately. The only requirement in the TPP agreement is the length patent resolution patent handling and related issues. Consequently Indonesia does get to decide whether a patent is valid or not. Thereby if Indonesian patent officers are of any good they could theoretically protect us from patent trolls.Currently drug patents are applied worldwide anyway including Indonesia. UU no  tahun  pasal  PDF says that patent length is  years. So reduction to  years is good. Really there is no definite loss here in medical patent front except perhaps patent override. The case about HIV  Hepatitis B  patent overrides in  were mostly for drugs that were near the end of their patent length except for one. And moreover it is not really an override but rather the govt licenses the drugs for public good. This is allowable in the TPP agreement. Why the fuss?News tends to be exaggerating whether pros or cons. So gotta find the truth yourself. Dig the source yourself in Wikileaks. It is pretty complete.

5812802,0,t1_cxhlykw,what drugs are is irrelevant. a lot of danger of those socalled hard drugs are actually caused by the fact that theyre illegal. For examplecimeng is very safe but when illegal the quality of weed is poor. this poor quality of weed necessitates user to inhale more. more burned weed means more smoke and toxic substances. because its illegal users tend to socially seclude themselves and make their life problems worse. This is unfortunate because weed is actually a good social lubricant.LSD and ecstasy are moderately safe but when illegal drug dealers introduce other chemical and adulterants and makes it hard to dose making their consumption a big hazard.Heroin and Crack Cocaine are really dangerous. But if safe alternative psychoactive drugs exist who would consume them anyway? Poeple arent stupid they know the danger. The thing that pushes them to use these drugs are because there are no safe and legal alternatives. To better understand this complicated problem of war on drugs I recommend you to watch this videoIts a complicated matter so a  minutes video is definitely to be taken with a grain of salt. However it might change your view and open your mind. The Badan Narkotika Nasional is a taxfunded institution. Its your money.

Anakanak perempuan satu kelas mendadak bertingkah aneh menjerit melolong kejangkejang pingsan mendelikdelik tertawa bersuara lain secara hampir serempak dalam pelukan gurunya masingmasing. Para calon dokter FK UMY kemudian merencanakan menggelar seminar tentang kesurupan masal ini dengan pembicara dua psikiater dan satu psikolog. Yaitu saya sendiri sahabat saya Rusdi Maslim SpKJ dan Prof DR Nurocman Dekan Fak Psikologi UGM.gtSaya susah payah menyiapkan makalah untuk fenomena kesurupan yang tidak individual tapi serempak pada anak perempuan satu kelas ini. Tepat pagi hari jam . di hari seminar itu terjadi gempa dahsyat yang mengguncangkan Bantul Yogyakarta dengan ribuan korban meninggal. Seminar jelas batal tak jadi dilaksanakan karena gedung tempat seminar itu doyong dan retakretak berat. Sayang andaikata seminar jadi dilaksanakan tentu terjadi diskusi psikistri dan psikologi budaya yang menarik antara pembicara sendiri. Sampai sekarang tak ada lagi keinginan untuk mengadakan seminar tentang kesurupan masal dalam perspektif psikiatri dan psikologi budaya itu.Saya coba gugling tapi makalah itu tidak bisa ditemukan. Yang jelas peristiwa kesurupan massal itu bukan sesuatu yang asing di psikiatri. Sayang sekali belum ada hasil penelitian untuk fenomena ini yang gampang diakses. ,indonesia,d2x5rw6,1,t5_2qkte

7753780,0,t3_4li99a,ok Part LONG POST but please read there are  questions in there in bold.Here are a couple of fun facts about Iran We have public universities and if you pass excel your entrance exam called the Konkoor which is a french word and is as hard as an SAT test you can go to university for FREE!  Passing it wont do anything. It depends on the relative competition. It involves a lot of subjects it doesnt matter whether you are an art major or a med major no premed in iran YOU HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING FROM EVERY SUBJECT TAUGHT TO YOU EVER.  Unlike popular belief our women drive and and attend university.  of STEM students in Iran are Women. Our STEM field is probably the second strongest in the region Israel is first.  One thing I like best is our ability to make our own technology under severe sanctions. Since  Iran has been put under sanctions by the USA and the EU and plans to remove them for the first time was set for . As a result we have persevered and improved in our STEM fields to create domestic technologies to compensate for shortages. For example take a look at these headlines  Nanotech in Iran Iran is top of the world in science growth Iranian science shows worlds fastest growth ranks th in science production in  Iran and Turkey Closing in on Israel When It Comes to Science Irans Video Game industry  Meet The Iranian Entrepreneur Taking On Apple Watch Dr. Gholam A. Peyman inventor of LASIK receives National Medal of Technology and Innovation from Pres. Obama Dr. Zahra Alizadeh Thani greatest world female inventor Iranian woman wins maths top prize the Fields medal Check out the Humans of Tehran page on Facebook. It will shatter a lot of stereotypes Humans of TehranQuestion How is education in your country? Music and underground culture fasten your seatbelts!I would like to say that Iranians have a huge underground music scene because the allowed music scene is limited to Males as lead singers and very generic songs. The Arian band is an example here Bonus this exact same band sang a song with Chris De Burg and they wanted to do an album but the Ministry in Iran did not permit them. Heres the song  Of course other types of music allowed are traditional folk and poetry. Heres an example of Iranian folk music  The Iranians since the revolution love to imitate western cultures. As a result there is a huge underground culture. Most of them are veiled and you must knock on a door to see whats inside. Metaphorically of course. Usually what happens behind closed doors is left alone. Thats why when you come to an Iranian community on the internet they like to stay anonymous. You would see s fashion behind closed doors during the s for example. Its all veiled and is difficult to see especially with all the negative light the media is showing us to be. Many Iranians that become successful and gain fans from everywhere leave the country and usually settle in L.A. where both the Iranian community is big and where their music industry is located.You like heavy metal music? Watch this documentary by MTV You like rock?  amplt recorded in IranHeres the typical Iranian song today with a big fanbase Heres how Iranian songs sounded in the smid s Heres an Iranian specialty genre called Dumbolodimbol which is a typical Iranian dance music heard nearly in every Iranian venue. It started in the spresent.Heres Bandari  southern Iranian songHeres Iranian rap  recorded in IranHeres Iranian poetry I love youHeres JohnnyHeres a Prerevolution song You like to browse different Iranian songs whether it be underground allowed or by musicians outside the country? Browse the following websites  riranianmusic  Heres how we dance with our music Question Music in your country? If you are interested in travelling to Iran there is a facebook group which is for foreigners that travel to Iran and share their experiences. It will help you a lot See you in Iran you should most definitely check it out regardless.  Tourists from nearly all over the world now have visa on arrival except  countries link Ok so there are a lot of tourists coming and going from around the world. Recently when the sanctions got lifted Americans started flocking to Iran link to NYTThis might make you think how safe is Iran and whether there are dangers in travelling. I will let foreign tourists explain it for you A Girls Guide to Dressing Up for Iran Solo female travel in Iran PRI Were back from Iran. Heres what most surprised us.

Some have declared the color black is for Atjeh and red for Troemon. Most parties agreed on what has been defined on this card.gtIn Riauw almost each prince has a distinct maritime flag which changes continually.gtIn all the other places or islands not mentioned they use the Dutch maritime flag as the maritime flag for commerce which is also done in the Moluques. The maritime flags drawn in this residence ie. colonial district are normally used by the Chiefs of Key Juallah?.Never heard of the Kingdom of Troemon.

8408458,0,t3_4usvgt,Some analysis on the newest lineup  Luhut is moved to Maritime somewhat to alleviate concern that Jokowi is controlled by Luhut and to some extent assist Ahok in reclamation debacle. Wiranto is replacing Luhut a dubious move because Wiranto is implicated in lots of Orba cases and Wiranto is somewhat less tolerant than Luhut. But it may be done as a deal to prop up alliance with Hanura on further days. Sudirman Said is removed this is again a dubious move as SS has shown that he is loyal to Jokowi. This may be a deal with Golkar as a payment for Golkar supporting Jokowi in the future. Sri Mulyani hopefully will be a good decision maker to prop up our economy. Bambang has also been a good minister thats why he is only moved not replaced to Bappenas. Rizal Ramli is correct to be replaced as he comments to much and he is commenting things that is outside his scope of work. Another strange move is a replacement of Anies Baswedan one of the most popular minister on Jokowis cabinet loyal to Jokowi a force of sanity and liberalism on Indonesia and one of people who state that Islamic principle should not be pushed on children.Overall apart from RR and Sri Mulyani I am quite disappointed with Jokowis new choice of ministers. ,indonesia,d5slpc7,10,t5_2qkte

PDIP could still pick Risma but seeing that they will also want to defend East Java against GerindraPKS incursion they will most likely to keep Risma in East Java to secure the governorship. It is more likely that PDIP will go for Ahok but silent for few weeks waiting for seams of the coalition to blow up and it seems that their waiting game is working their enemy is fighting among themselves. Megawati is a person that is very hard to forgive I bet she wont forgive Gerindras actions during Jokowis presidential campaign.PKB will most likely support Yusril. seeing that they dont accept Mardani and they prefer someone else. PAN will most likely follow suit with PKB but they matter little anyway.I think this is also a move by PKS to cement their permanent relationship with Gerindra seeing that they are the only loyal one to Gerindra thus they think they have the right to choose the vice governor not the other parties PKB Demokrat etc. that have left KMP. In the end I dont think it will work. The Islamist demographic will be split into two some will go for Yusril and some will go for Sandiaga. The Islamist demographic is the only demographic that is staunchly antiAhok other demographic are leaning towards Ahok and I have to say most minorities Christians Buddhist etc. will be staunchly on Ahok side.

I was an architecture student and I studied some stuff about Nusantara as we learn about vernacular architecture in Indonesia.AFAIK the term Nusantara was coined by Gajah Mada from Majapahit Kingdom. It was meant to represent a unity of areas colonised by Majapahit  Kingdom spreading from Sumatra to Papua.Nowadays Nusantara is more referred as contemporary Indonesian Archipelago which means if its part of Malaysia then its not part of Nusantara.IMHO Indonesia is very rich with so many languages and cultural diversity. Papua isnt the only place in Nusantara which is culturally different from other parts of the country. Its just in the other islands cultural assimilation process urbanization and city development had started early than Papua. But yeah Papua is culturally part of Indonesia.

However my friends lied me by using the gadget fair for a different purpose. In case the purpose for example wanting me to treat them. DID THE GADGET FAIR LIED ?Please understand properly about Ahoks statement. People using something to lie people doesnt mean that the something is wrong or lying. Remember that ! What Ahok mean A use bible to lie B in order to block Bs human right to choose Ahok. The truth is that B and other people has their full right to choose who will be their leader. Understand ?Im sure that Ahok did a little blunder but the word pake saved him.

The writer of the article is too biased against the mayor.I followed RKs twitter and facebook to get update on the latest Bandungs issue and development. I understand why his actions can be perceived as pencitraan and agree that he can look a tad too sensitive or defensive sometimes. I may also disagree with some of his decisions. But the thing is I also understand that behind the social media post and his words there are some substantial actions with proper reasoning going on which shows hispemkots efforts to fix the problem and to communicate it with the citizen. Not just words not just ads or pencitraan. Its anecdotal but my family and I feel the positive changes from Bandung government as a whole and I think RK plays no small role in that change his media play aside.Flood? Isnt it clear that the govt has done what they can with the water highway pumps installation biopore project campaigns to have people not to throw away trash everywhere not to mention the upcoming reservoir cooperation with Netherlands on water issue etc. Hell go to  and youll find every detail of Bandung government action on every issue. Too bad some people prefer to protest first research later.Re the event on flood that he allegedly refuses to attend mentioned on the article from the title itself its clear that it is provocative in nature. Why not put a more objective title which shows willingness to cooperate rather than to point a finger? Kota Bandung Banjir.

FPI and the likes then show up as an alternative ha.gt The problem is the writer in the article can only complain but cant offer a alternative. In the West they used to clear people from slums just like Indonesia. And this was as recent as the s. From an economics point of view it makes good senseYou cannot just put out the context that the s was the period of developmentalism New Order was huge on developmentalism too. Forced eviction and all.They were doing exactly the same thing back then but now it has become a passe. That kind of policies are outdated now and we still try to enforce it? People like Wilson have realized their forefathers mistake  thats why they criticize people who still look up to the mistakes they did in the past. Take any class on urban development and the norm now is participatory development. Not elitedriven developmentalism.Ahok didnt do this then that is a rather lazy way to justify the policy.

9863058,0,t1_darl6yq,gt Ill argue on the purpose of high school. Most middle school students are still gullible and labil so to say. The majority of students actually make up their mind on what they want to do in high school not before.Thats because they usually werent allowed to think for themselves Go the fuck to school get good grades continue until highschool  beatings for every C  hours of isolation for every D theres no room for hobbies and the likes everyone are told to get high paying jobs such as a doctor engineer architect lawyer and stuff. No parent has ever went up and said You know... youre good at this Gunpla thing how about you start a shop to sell these? hobbies are always expensive they make a ton of money especially if youre the sole supplier of a niche marketgt Id say high school is more like a portal than a specialisation. That is the job of SMK and higher educations. Middle school and high schools job is to provide basic education hence wajib belajar  tahun. Geography basic economics math sciences arts are all basic educations. History and pkn while not core subjects are relevant if you intend to live in Indonesia and these subjects are not hard. Basic financing should be mandatory because youll need it whatever career you choose and were still among the lower threshold of financial literacy All the noncore subjects can be split between middle school and high school. Very narrow specialisation in high school will only result in yet another lulusan kacamata kuda who only knows one thing without the knowledge from other perspectives. Id rather not.High school should be the beginning of specialization not a mere portal thats what SMK is except SMK only teaches factory worker level skills now. Knowing one thing very well and no knowledge of others is the definition of specialist the earlier you specialize the better youd be in that field thats what years of working in your field does. Knowledge is gained much faster if its your hobby or you seek it yourself to solve a problem you encountered hammering it down wont helpgt Our curriculum is not as rigorous as say south korea so why are we left behind and why do they outperform other countries? My take is the problem lies in the quality of the human resources. How many teachers in public schools actually teach seriously? Only a handful. Private school teachers are usually better at teaching than in public schools. How many are teaching their subjects up to standard? I attended public schools in middle and high school and I could say teachers dont give a damn about you. Take two of the best education systems finland and SK. Finland has high quality teachers and no segregation kelas unggulan etc. SK like any other east asian countries are academic driven and the students are very hardworking despite the heavy workload. Indonesia has neither.Rigorous curriculum is not the answer improving morale and spirit is. Both of your examples have distinct advantage homogenization. Their culture demands that people conform to the community standard and their community standard is work hard. You cant have that in Indonesia every little enclave have their own standard and attempting to get people to conform begins with but muh freedom of speech and cultureIronically Indonesians especially the native Muslims that cry out fucking Chinese taking our jobs are incredibly Chinese. Mainland Chinese. Have you ever heard of cha bu duo? Thats Mandarin for eh close enoughYou hire a staff to clean the desk and they just wipe it with some cloth once and be done with it eh close enough. You ask someone to type a document and there are some typos eh close enough. You ask someone to deliver something and they just drop it in the recipients front door eh close enough. You ask someone to fix your bike it still creaks a bit eh close enough. THAT is the problem. The spirit of you know  of the time  of the work is good enough. There is no pride in a job well done anyone that works as hard as they could gets mocked as smart ass boot licker workaholic not fun perfectionist and a variety of insults in regional dialect. Its bullshit and it breaks everything.Indonesian work spirit is doing as much as I could not as much as I should,indonesia,dat6gka,1,t5_2qkte

9863270,0,t1_dat6gka,To be a specialist you dont need to only learn one thing in high school. High school is already specialised in the sense that it branches to IPA and IPS. Further specialisation is not needed. As I said even still a lot of S mind you still S graduates face the same problem. Employers complain that these guys cant work with other people because theyre just used to work with people in their field. This is the problem that some guys in PII acknowledge engineers in Indonesia especially fresh graduates dont know how to work.Specialists can land a job but the most successful people I know are multifaceted. They are the ones that CREATE jobs.This is the reason why some universities including mine still make stuff like ethics and kewarganegaraan mandatory.gt Rigorous curriculum is not the answerI think you misunderstand me what I was trying to say is that the hs curriculum in Indonesia is not rigorous. Studying is not enjoyable in Indonesia. I hated math with passion in high school but I absolutely loved calculus when I went to uni. Why? The teachers. Thats why I brought up Finland. The teachers know how to teach they know how to make studying enjoyable. Our parents are obsessed with report card and rankings but the students dont keep up with it the way SK students do. I think were actually onto the same conclusion tbh. Big changes can be made by quality teachers. Thats why I dont think curriculum is a big problem because even if differing systems can work we can too.gt Their culture demands that people conform to the community standard and their community standard is work hard.Exactly. We need to make that a culture that is the problem.,indonesia,dat7gbk,1,t5_2qkte

Say Ive been asking around to no avail. Is there any highest hierarchy in Islam that can send out final word on interpretation of Quran and hadists?  gtwhy confusing? are you better than those fuckers or not?Confusing as in When ISIS does some of their handy work they shout online about that is not islam but on the other hand they are also being intolerant and racist themselves.gtif you demand muslim to care more fine but based on my observation some people expect muslim to care more while dont expect other or even themselves to care more tooIf you are going with that kind of question itll be throwing grenade back and forth each other. We must do our part more. You need to seriously denounce things that dragging your religions name into the gutter the nonmuslims need to stop generalizing. But none of that is going to happen when both side are being defensive AF. gtyou think Christianity has modernize while you yourself realized its the leader not the religionremember people have used bible verse for something like antisemitism inquisition and other bad things something that those fuckers do right nowYou keep on with the small stuff and comparisons man. Look...For me Christianity Christians Christian leaders is one. Same as Islam Muslim Caliphate is also one. Each represents the other.

That person could sue the government for millions and have a good chance of winning in court. The government even have to place a proper sign and caution when performing maintenance of these facilities. In Indonesia a single cone or home made awas cat basah sign is considered enough caution. In Indonesia the Court process is as such. You may sue the government but even if you win your settlement will arrive within the time frame of maybe and never because government owned land ada di list Dirjen keuangan can not be seized and auctioned to pay for these settlement. Menang pun kalah. Literally you have nothing you can do to enforce these payments.There was a case in West Jakarta where this person actually won the case of illegal trespassing of the Government in a privately owned land. This person also claims for compensation from the government which sadly tak kunjung datangSo if you ever asked why our infrastructure is poorly designed and poorly made its because the government cannot be sued,indonesia,ded50um,5,t5_2qkte

11406221,0,t3_62secz,Thats actually quite understandable considering the trend. People find that the localnational language to be somehow less sophisticated than English. People would prefer using English termswords instead of Indo words. And those who are more well versed in English would naturally go to speak English rather than speaking in Indonesian. Its not a unique phenomena in my opinion. However its quite sad to see how some Indonesian words would might eventually fall out of use because people would rather use foreign words instead of the Indonesian counterparts.

11459592,0,t3_63l121,thats a bold plan from you kid ive assisted a friend convert her KTP from Islam to Christian around  years ago its easier back then but its WAY HARDER now pay attention to what this points are. do you need to convert only your faith? or you also need written approval in the form of ID card?if you want to follow a specific religion that isnt the same that is given by your parents  written in your KTP you dont have to change it and avoid conflict with your parents by keeping silent.if you are ashamed on what it is written previously or you need to marry someone want to apply to a specific place that is more beneficial if you change what it is written you might need to prepare from now. i advice if you can you to even write what religion you want in your ID even before it is issued.  because its hard to change the Agama column.you can no longer nembak KTP nowadays due to the eKTP system and changing a data there requires some kind of proof.ex you want to change from Belum Kawin to Kawin you need a Surat Nikah.  and last time i heard to change the Agama column you need a statement letter from Kemenag. dont get intimidated just yet if you are planning to change your data in your ID later then..first you need to have your own Alamat having your own houseapartment  because by then you dont need to borrow your parents KK anymore for all the procedures. the next phase is you have to get surat pengantar from your RT BE PREPARED TO BE DICERAMAHIN if your RT and your neighbourhood is muslim majority.after that the rest are waiting game by then and be prepared to kehabisan blangkon to print your new eKTPif nowadays you need to get a surat from KEMENAG i advice you to find a jasa pengurusan  its kinda expensive but you dont need to face all the hassle yourself awas kena tipu jasa ini sering banyak yang nipui hope you find the answer you wanted.,indonesia,dfuxr0p,25,t5_2qkte
