4287085,0,t1_cs8nolv,Nice portfolio.  I have a soft spot for mechsmechanical sketches and designs. Particularly when they seem to focus on functionality while looking good. Personally random gears or tubes that dont seem to go anywhere bother me.   I much prefer your style where you can see how joints seem to have a realistic range of motion and construction looks plausable and shieldingplating seems to make sense.    It looks well thought out actually engineered.  ,GameDev1,cs8vj2i,1,t5_38pfi
