2447187,0,t1_cme59dg,Opinions vary but I believe their similarities are primarily due to them being designed in the same era for a similar mission. Swingwings were the eras solution to having both low and highspeed performance see F F MiG MiG. If one was copiedinspired by the other itd be the TU copying the B since development on the latter started in the late s while the design for the former didnt start until the early s.,FighterJets,cme6djq,7,t5_2ujqo
2617971,0,t3_2puxt8,It looks almost like its using lateral thrust vectoring. I know the F has thrust vectoring but not sure if it is able to thrust vector its yaw.,FighterJets,cn0b2kl,6,t5_2ujqo

5245917,0,t1_cviausq,They are capable of carrying all of the regular FEF armaments but of course it depends on their mission.  If they were being sent into the  Gulf War theyd carry a couple of HARMs and a couple of airtoair missiles of some sort.  The EFs of the Gulf War flew with no armament at all ground or air.  If necessary for range even the EFG would carry fuel tanks instead of missiles though.  The F isnt known for its speed either...unlike the Mach .capable EF much less so when loaded with jammer pods.  In a pinch theyd be expected to do a minimal of fighting themselves and rely on friendly fighters for help.,FighterJets,cviblp6,2,t5_2ujqo

The ones they posted incorrectly were spammed so its also why you havent seen anything in a couple days. ,FighterJets,ddotwxu,1,t5_2ujqo
