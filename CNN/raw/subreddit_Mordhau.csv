7508076,0,t1_d2vjobh,You cant hold the throw it has a clear windup so you simply parry it and riposte off the parry if you want. It acts more like a longerrange weapon which cant be feinted or dragged than anything else.Statement from Marox on the Mordhau forums when asked about whether or not throwing weapons in close quarters will be obnoxious. ,Mordhau,d2vmp1u,3,t5_387za

8805527,0,t3_50qec9,Im not sure how good this would feel though if its done poorly it might feel like using an xbox controller and youll feel unable to turn or move properly. On the other hand if they were too lax it wouldnt make a difference anyways. And having an equipped shield block attacks passively is STUPID ANYWAY. Imagine just turning to attack someone and suddenly most of your left flank is completely covered by a massive shield hitbox. Not necessarily a bad idea considering the game already has a turncap while attacking but the shield thing is stupid and I hope people give it up soon.  Idc if its realistic this has to be a functional game and if you werent preparedin the middle of attackingunprepared irl getting your shield arm slammed by a hammer or we your shield probs wouldnt help you much itd probably hurt like fuck actually.,Mordhau,d76azr8,4,t5_387za

11458188,0,t1_dfur6nk,gtIf you backed thinking it will give you a say or a vote on how the game develops then you will be disappointed.So youre telling me that the devs will not be collecting feedback from their playerbase at all?gtGiven the devs history and the number of times this topic has appeared I find it highly unlikely they havent at least considered the idea. But if it doesnt fit with their vision of the game then testing it in alpha or beta simply to appease people like you would be even more disingenuous. They literally mentioned theyd be open to testing this specific mechanic in the last interview.If theres been a consistent call for this topic to be addressed then clearly theres a demand for it.Do you think they should not test it to appease people like you?gtId personally be OK with them deleting archers but thered be little point in doing an alpha test without archers because its not gonna happen.If they want to test a specific combat mechanic this is exactly what they should do. It would increase their datatime ratio.gtWhy add the complexity of a system like this? Id argue that its not very complex at all.gtWhat does it actually achieve?Itll create a greater tangible difference in weapon types and force different play styles. Essentially itll add depth to an otherwise shallow system in this regard.,Mordhau,dfus09l,2,t5_387za
