10526384,0,t1_dcy0w3g,We never knew exactly but we knew something. A rumor swirled that he got something from Wales people. That never made air but the first night they went to Tia Lou Wale was performing. The worst decision they made was not to take a stance early on the over drinking. I mean we had... people on long term drinking restriction. You remember the hospital bracelet Kass was wearing? Alcohol poisoning  on short term restriction and  or  teetering on getting on restriction.Kass should have been thrown off instead of Theo. Mike should have been gone weeks before he was and Peter should have been kicked off weeks before as well.,mtvrealworld,dd1a3l2,1,t5_2xd45
