5410011,0,t3_3p1v3m,Well you would need a lift crystal which from the description wasnt small plus a power crystal.  The ships use trim crystals to maintain the ships trim so I would think with just the lift crystal it would be hard to maneuver youd have a tendency to roll and spin.  As for the silk thats ether silk they used for the marine parachutes it catches the ether currents not air.  They did talk about silk clothing so that kind of silk may be possible for a standard parachute but falling down with little control compared to the ether silk ones into the mist and or the surface sounds worse than the alternative.,cinderspires,cw36t3y,1,t5_3206a
