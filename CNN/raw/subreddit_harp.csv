3094557,0,t1_cohotbi,I didnt know you could add lever to harp. It makes me so happy! And optimistic. I have no idea if Ill be able to do it myself though. If I buy the harp Ill at least give it a try. Thank you for taking your time to answer me! Im going to try the harp tomorrow and will probably buy it. Its really the only thing I can afford right now. For now  strings seems a very wide range for me... My main instrument is a  hole ocarina and I am used to that range. Anything over it will feel enormous !  I will probably end up changing my mind about that fact as I get used to the harp though. But its ok. I can always buy a bigger harp later at least Ill be able to play something the meantime.,harp,coiqzq7,1,t5_2t0pz
9649818,0,t1_d9jp51h,I bought the Harpune kit a year ago I recommend it. It required some extra work about ish hours for my slow self I think but I got a custom stained harp out of it and the whole process was cool. The main thing is that all of his harps are Paraguayan style so the string spacing is narrower.I wanted a harp but am also well aware of my tendency to take ages to actually learn something so I figured my options were to either rent or buy and in this case they wouldve been about the same price. So it made more sense to pay that price to own it versus just have it for several months.Edit Also his harps do not come with levers! You can either take that as a challenge to learn modes or add them yourself. There is a video of how to add them to the two small wooden kits but Im not sure how well it would work for the PVC harp.,harp,da2jg4m,1,t5_2t0pz

11618181,0,t3_65siel,There are many more experienced harpists than I am but here you go.  Slurs are kind of an odd little part of harp notation simply because harps are mostly always slurring by default as you pluck the string and it rings until it fades away or you muffle the strings on purpose to stop the sound.  If I were sitting down to play the piece youve posted I would treat the slurs more as phrasing than anythingpossibly just giving a little more oomph to the first of a new set of slurred notes.  And no muffling or damping is indicated so Id just play the notes and let them all ring without trying to make sure the nd and rd notes of each triplet dont overstay their note space.  ..harp notes almost ALWAYS overstay their allotted time!  Its like playing the piano with the sustain pedal constantly down.As far as the dotted quarter notes Id say just hit the first note of each triplet a little harder than the other two notes so it lasts the length of the whole triplet.I hope that helps a little.,harp,dgcxjd5,2,t5_2t0pz
