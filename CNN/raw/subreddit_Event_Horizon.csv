914412,0,t3_24l64c,I take on a whim and visit the hangar.  Im not entirely sure why Im doing this.  Never acted spur of the moment before.  I hope this station isnt rubbing off unpleasantly.  Just as long as that batarian doesnt show up...As I scan my surroundings my vision is attracted to an unusual sight.  A volus. Any minor suit puncture will do.  Depressurization followed by suffocation.  Very easy.  On a PMC station.  With a sniper rifle.  Well Ive seen hanar fight so this isnt that far off.  Surprisingly I do not feel the typical disdain for other species.  In fact it seems closer to respect.  It probably has to do with the fact that volus similar to hanar are commonly the butt of many intergalactic jokes.  I shove that train of thought away but decide to introduce myself anyway.Greetings volus.  Might I inquire your reasons for being here? a hint of amusement escapes my voice.,Event_Horizon,ch883ln,2,t5_31gjx
928240,0,t1_ch9os03,In the heat of battle I had forgotten about the odd looking human. He looked like he had missed his shot against a batarian. I quickly zoomed in and shot at the bartarian closest to the human then quickly boosted myself towards a group of crates. Get to cover  both of you! I say over the comms as I ready my rifle to give both of them covering fire.,Event_Horizon,ch9snla,3,t5_31gjx
936276,0,t1_chapj3t,More of those yellow boxes? I ask excitedly. They were tasty I add as if to justify my outburst.,Event_Horizon,chapk9s,3,t5_31gjx

1009427,0,t1_chizlge,Yeh give me a day to prepare and Ill look into getting blood pack armour as well. I look at Cas dont worry Ive got this.,Event_Horizon,chj12lv,1,t5_31gjx
1054857,0,t1_chngaq8,Hmm well Ive only really just met the ones youve mentioned and havent had the time to get to know any of them in detail.  I walk over to my manufactured pistol parts and begin putting them together.My opinions of each arent very in depth at this point but since you asked Ill give you the run down.  This bunch is pretty volatile.  From what I can tell Ketal is simply a high functioning sociopath becoming friends with him or any other interaction of substance with him is probably pointless as I dont think there really is anything inside of him.Stag is like any other Krogan Ive met based on my encounters with him hes a victim of circumstance doing the one thing he feels able to do.  Live by the gun.  He might have in him the potential for other endeavors but the universe doesnt let a krogan do anything but kill.  He at least chose Event Horizon though as his employer which means he is at least selective about his jobs.  He has obvious issues with turians that he will either move past or may end up becoming a huge issue here on White Station.  He may not be here for just a paycheck.However Cas is here for a pay check and I know that because he told me.  Its understandable for a mercenary but he also has some serious emotional baggage he is in the middle of.  He has an inner moral compass but doesnt seem terribly concerned with following it anymore.  Its still there though otherwise I dont think he would have signed up with Event Horizon.  Bottom line he is capable of anything and if forced to choose between money or the members of Event Horizon like you or me he would choose money every time.Commander Faora I dont really have a read on yet.  She is very reserved... even for a military woman.  I think she is dedicated to making the universe a better place but simply doesnt know how to do that exactly.  For that matter neither do I.  Probably why I signed up with this outfit.  Kinda the only game in town right now.The other members such as the batarian pilot and our quarian head of security seem fairly...centered or well adjusted.  Which is good.  We need more people like that to balance out some of the others I mentioned before. I heft up my newly constructed predator admiring the shining angles.  Maybe about time for some target practice in our combat sim?,Event_Horizon,cho6xbq,1,t5_31gjx
1671440,0,t1_cjpua06,Sure thing Cas...  I almost whisper the words back... the darkness of these labs is definitely making me uneasy.  I feel... maybe isolated is the right word?  My grip on my predator tightens.  Lights would be nice.I activate my omnitool and ping the surroundings for a wireless signal.  I find one and connect.  The labs wireless servers ping me for a username and password account.  I type Guest for the username and brute force hack their password expecting it to be short.  It is and Im into the system with minimal account privileges.  I get a rudimentary map with several locations leading to doors that are blacked out apparently they are off limits to guest users.  However I quickly find the command to activate the lights to our room.  They snap on with a loud cracking buzz and Im blinded for a few seconds as my eyes adjust...,Event_Horizon,cjpui0j,1,t5_31gjx
1706255,0,t1_cju4tk6,Viktor. It wasnt perfect but he was rocking a decent Russian accent. Do you think they will be having issue with shotgun? He pulled the relic gun from his hip never had a chance to show Jelak before hed run off to Noveria. Its uh... Normal accent. Its the one that mystery buyer gave me codes to in the archives.,Event_Horizon,cju8hn9,2,t5_31gjx
3056906,0,t1_coeuf1f,Oh youre the pilot? Well I hope you can fly whatever were getting. So whyd you join up?She asked innocently.,Event_Horizon,coeugp5,3,t5_31gjx
