211284,0,t1_cf2fyjv,I completely disagree. But it depends on the area so I will only speak for the parks in my city that I know very well. First they are completely open as in not gated so anyone could go in at any moment of the day or night. There is no one to stop you. A park being closed is not going to deter illicit activity. Do you really think those folks will care? No park rangers or police patrolling them means fewer eyes and those closedatsunset parks will be an even better spot for illegal activity. However in my area its not really an issue as the only illegal thing that happens at night is typically just a handful of college kids smoking pot. Even so at one of the parks I know there is usually a police patrol that circles a few times throughout the evening.Second do you really think it is going to be a significant drain on police and emergency resources? Again it depends where you are but by me the parks are very quiet and uneventful at night. The occasional police patrol like the one I mentioned which already happens might be enough. Or dont add any security but still warn people to use the park at their own risk.And Im not saying the park should be simultaneously manned and unmanned. Thats silly. Im saying leave them unmanned after sunset and discourage but not outright ban people from being there for their safety. If someone got hurt or was in trouble of some sort they call  and emergency vehicles come. Thats what I mean by emergency service being available. Theyre not going to ignore you because you are in a park that is closed. If its a secluded or hard to reach park or area thats a different story but as I said it depends on the situation. All the parks by me are entirely and easily accessible by vehicles.gtPeople as a whole cant be trusted to be grown up enough to do things that are safe or intelligent.Great. So we restrict the freedoms of everybody because of a few stupid people. Sadly this happens but it definitely isnt always justified. We get in the endless mucky debate with regard to what extent we should restrict what people put in their bodies how much they drink or how much they smoke and what sort of behaviors they can or cannot do. Yes I do think some places are too dangerous to let people wander off to at certain or any hour of the day. However there are many neighborhoods where the parks are quite safe at night my own included and for those I say live and let live. Let the rangers go home but just leave the park open because it really isnt that big of a deal.,running,cf2id91,3,t5_2qlit

A pair of Asics with a dozen  screws in each one worked perfectly as long as I stayed away from the deeper slush.

When your appetite comes back be sure to eat plenty because your glycogen stores will be very low after fighting a serious infection. Your body delegates all of that to fighting it off and none of it to your muscles. For your first couple of runs just go very short and very easy err on the side of too short.

285100,0,t1_cfaa3zw,I really like the answer whichever helps you more.I can only think in terms of distance.  It doesnt matter how long I was out there if I didnt cover the distance I felt I needed to.  Ive skipped measuring my time many times but I dont think Ive ever done a run without knowing the distance to the tenth of a mile.  I think it stems from the attitude that I want to finish the full distance first and foremost.  Like thats the main part of the challenge for me so the only way I can prove to myself that I can do it is to get progressively closer.Theres nothing about my attitude that makes it inherently better or worse than any other...its just what works for me.  My longest run training for my first full was . miles.  Finishing that and knowing that I had enough left in my legs to run for five more miles being very familiar with what running five miles at my pace feels like is what gave me the confidence to know that I could complete the whole thing on race day.The reality is that Im training my body to perform at a certain effort for a certain time that happens to be long enough to cover that arbitrary distance but thats not how it feels inside my head.  I suspect that is typical again not because its better but because more people happened to be wired that way.Im training for my third marathon now.  Ive done it twice and so now I want to do it faster.  Time matters but I still think in terms of distance I only consider time in terms of my pace.  I.e. I always aim to finish my distance under a certain per mile pace not run a pace and aim to finish the distance if that makes sense.My strategy might not work for you and theres probably no right answer anyone can give you.  Id suggest just reading through others responses and see what resonates with you.Maybe also take a few moments and think about the actual race.  Go inside your head and picture yourself doing it.  What intimidates you about it the most?  Running nonstop for    hours?  Running . miles?  Holding your certain pace for a long time over a long distance?  That may give you insights into which facets of the training are most important to you mentally and a suggestion on which side to focus the most on.Any training plan properly followed! will get your body physically prepared to do the task.  Anyone who is physically able to train can do it.  For me distance running is primarily a mental challenge so the strategy that gives me confidence is what seems to work the best.Edit...sorry that got long and rambly...sometimes I start typing and cant stop right away ,running,cfabcbq,1,t5_2qlit

If you can get a face mask it helps a great amount because the mask keeps the warmth of your breath in and the cold temperature out so you are actually breathing in warmer air.

I personally dont like the prevalence of these types of articles and the mindset that accompanies them.I apologize if this is a little philosophical.But these studies and I suppose more specifically the flavorful articles that accompany them  are written as though living as long as possible is our highest goal.

And ironically this sort of anxiety the effects of stress can contribute as much to an early death than running too manynot enough miles or eating too manynot enough fish.I mean listen to medical advice. But dont worry so much when its a matter of possibly gaining a few extra months or years. Think more about the quality of those years as judged by the life you have to look back on.

Form is very important to running and theres no magical shoe that will fix your running pains for you thats true. But there are shoes that work better with your form what works for some runners does not work for others.Go to a running specialty store and get fitted and analyzed. Tell them youve been having pain wearing your motion control shoes and see what they recommend my guess would be they try to put you in a neutral or light stability shoe Nike Pegasus or Nike Structure something like that. Shoes like the Xero Shoes were all the rage for a while its great if you want to be unique and minimal and free but if your goal is to complete couch to K get healthy get faster get more fit you need a real shoe.,running,cg1iqys,1,t5_2qlit

But in my opinion So take this with a grain of salt it is very hard to actually know your Genetic Range in fact Im not sure if its possible at all because there isnt a Long distance gene long distance running and any type of physical activity is the result of a series of extremely complex interactions between dozens and possibly hundreds of genes.So I guess that instead of being concerned about our limits is better to stay focus on expanding them as much as possible.,running,cg8we3p,3,t5_2qlit

Unless you have access to testing you and do simple field tests to determine what they are. A  min run at a pace that is uncomfortable but you can maintain for the whole  min then rest for min and repeat. This should give you an average of your Anaerobic threshold. If the avg of your second  min is much lower than the average of your first you still need conditioning use the lower value. Google Carmichael field test for more info.

I had been running in worn out Pegasus s like  miles or more on this pair and injured my knee.  I couldnt run for a month and tried every high cushion shoe on the market.  The Vomero  was the best thing I ever felt on my foot.  It fit well like the Pegasus but better.  It was highly cushioned and very durable.  If I hadnt found them I would have quit running because I simply wasnt able to in any other shoe.  I bought two pairs before the update to .  The Vomero  had a wider toe box less cushion and lasted half as long.  The Vomero six was a nightmare it made me feel like I was always running uphill and generally felt more like a stability shoe exactly the opposite of what a supinator like me needs in a shoe I cant comment on durability because I didnt put up with them long enough to find out.  The Vomero  is great fits well durable and well cushioned without feeling squishy.  The  feels about the same so far.

Just FYI taking Vitamin C in one high dose after getting sick will not decrease the duration or severity but if you take a regular dose everyday it can decrease duration or severity. There have actually been studies. Vitamin C taken regularly can also have beneficial effects if you are a intense athlete.Im still learning but based on my diet and my teacher I think for now this would cover all my bases. Although my professor always recommends centrum as insurance if you dont get enough vitamins in your diet that day. But vitamins arent really meant for giving you a super boost they are literally what your body needs to survive.Im not sure if this is what the discussion was meant to talk about but I honestly love my major and wanted to share my views!,running,cgfbn7n,7,t5_2qlit

699104,0,t3_225zsd,A  mile time is by no means a bad time! My advice just get out there and go run! Just head out around your neighborhood and run from your house or Apt. Try looking at mapmyrun.com youll find all sorts of routes made by other people of all distances. Start out your runs taking it easy just  or two miles one day. If that feels okay go a little longer the next day. If you have a buddy who you can con into running a couple times with you that always helps to have a running partner alongside you. Cross Country is all about distance trust me youll get there!

707313,0,t3_229ns0,It does use a different muscle set.  That is probably why you mentioned your legs hurt and not your lungs!  Thats actually good news as I have found the legs adapt better than cardio.  I would suggest  day on  days off for the first  weeks a lot like if you were just starting weight training.

707956,0,t3_229m3i,Ive been on a reliever inhaler salbutamol for years and I only used to take it before I went running. I would take it twice just before going running and never during the run itself. About a month ago I changed instead to using a preventer inhaler cortisoid steroid and since then Ive not had to use my reliever inhaler at all.It sounds to me that youre confusing general lack of breath from intense exercise with asthma. In my experience general lack of breath goes away as soon as you stop or within  seconds. This is something that everyone experiences and is nothing to do with asthma. Whereas asthma will linger for much much longer. If youre not confusing the two then get yourself to a doctor as your medication is not working for you.If you are on the correct medication then you can achieve anything that any other normal runner can. But you need to be able to recognise your symptoms and know when they are under your control and when they are not.To give you some context I ran a  HM two weeks ago.,running,cgkqxoy,1,t5_2qlit

In fact a lot of protein supplements proudly advertise how low in carbohydrates they are.I use Matrix Anabolic protein supplements and it has about  grams of carbs per serving  grams of powder per serving which isnt much and thats the cheap stuff. If you buy Isopure it has no carbs in it whatsoever. I have absolutely no idea why your doctor would say that whey protein isnt safe but if thats actually what he said then I think you should go for a second opinion.And just to reiterate creatine  protein. A protein is a chain of amino acids linked by peptide bonds whereas Creatine is an acid that supplies phosphate groups for rapid ATP resynthesis when muscles are working hard meaning you can contract your muscles for more than just a few seconds at a time. Im not sure how taking creatine supplementation would increase serum protein at all. Source medical studentEDIT just had a thought. Is there any way there couldve been a misunderstanding here?

Slowly pull your belly button to your spine as you press your entire back to the floor. You will also be engaging your glutes as your hips tilt slightly. This is proper engagement of your abdominal.

Its possible although its not easy and the faster you increase your mileage the more injury risk you accept knee trouble almost kept me from completing my training. One recommendation Ill make to you now. Whatever training plan you might choose make sure you build at least an additional two to four weeks into it. Inevitably injury sickness and life in general will cause some weeks to be a complete loss and it gives you a cushion. Not a week goes by that rrunning doesnt see a post from somebody significantly behind on their training three weeks before their marathon.

What Ive found across my  years of running is that there is not one single shoe out there that works for everyone.  For me the Vibrams caused me to focus more on form because screwing up your form in Vibrams really really hurts.  I could have fixed my form in regular running shoes but indications that my form was going back to my old ways wouldnt have been so pronounced.In summary if a shoe works for you keep using it.

1008487,0,t3_25mzri,For your first race focus on reigning in the adrenaline.  If youre not in one of the higher brackets which you probably arent in your first race pretty much everyone is going to start off faster than they should.  Dont worry about keeping pace with them if you hold yourself back youll probably be hitting your pace since the adrenaline will make it feel like you should be going faster.  Once you settle into a pace eventually youll be passing a bunch of familiar faces bombing out between  miles because they blew their load in the first half of the race.I like the ideas of negative splits in the back half of the race.  My best races start off slow and build better to have reserves in the last  miles than to be running on fumes.The ks I won I started off slow having run many a halfmarathon then after mile  I poured on the speed because Holy crap!  mile left and all of this energy!  . is a lot different than a k of course but the point is still valid  be conservative at the start of the race.

My girlfriend has also started running recently but she runs a fair bit slower than me so I join her for recovery runs after my long runs. Her pace is quite a bit slower than mine minkm and we only do km together however I noticed that whenever I go with her my shins start hurting quite a bit by the end of the run. I suspect that its shin splints but Im at a loss why Id get them during a slow run as opposed to my normal pace. Is it bad form?  I tried going for a run by myself yesterday the day after going with her on a short run but I had to call it quits at km because the shin pain was getting too great.

1118104,0,t3_26ti6v,One unlikely possibility is a labral tear.  This is basically a tear in the cartilage seal that keeps your hip socket stable.  Usually causes a cluster of hip problems like clicking and pain often near the groin but sometimes also around the outside of the hip.  The tear is caused by your femur or your pelvis pinching the labrum.  This will be missed by a standard MRI or Xray it needs an MRarthrogram MRI with dye in hip joint to detect.  Rare but diagnosed more often now because of increased awareness.    People with your symptoms might also have a femoral stress fracture but an MRI should have picked that up.  The hip is a complex joint and there is a whole heck of a lot that can go wrong so even if its just a softtissue thing like hip flexor tendonitis or bursitis or ITBS it can be tricky to fix.  With soft tissue stuff usually seeing a good PT who works with runners is the best bet.  If I were you I would seek out the opinion of an orthopedist who focuses on hip injuries in athletes.  For whatever reason the hip is not a popular area for orthopedists to specialize inthere are a lot more knee elbow and shoulder docs out there at least in my area of the country.  And those who do focus on the hip often specialize in hip replacement not hip joint injuries in athletes.  But if youre near a major city there should be at least one good hip specialist who works with a lot of athletes. ,running,chvdzxg,1,t5_2qlit

1126561,0,t3_270zz5,Earlier in the week my Sunday long run session was weighing on my mind. The plan was km with  at marathon pace km... a long tough run. A similar run a few weeks earlier km with  at MP was a big struggle and left me ruined for several hours afterwards. It wasnt shaping up to be an enjoyable Sunday but with my goal marathon in  weeks this would be my last difficult long run.Sunday morning rolled around. I originally wanted to get out the door at am but I used the admittedly light rain as an excuse to put it off and slept in for a while. Eventually I conceded that this session had to be run so I got myself up and forced myeslf out the door a little before   very wary of the impending difficulty all the while.The first km seemed to really drag on and in the last few kms I was really wondering if Id be able to pick up the pace according to the plan. Kilometer  ticked by so I hit the lap button on my garmin and got my legs working. They felt heavier than I can ever recall them feeling  again I was worried about keeping that goal pace. The next few kilometers I sat a fraction slower than the target as I settled into the pattern and warmed up.Time and distance passed and the total readout on my garmin ticked over the km mark. Then km. The rain had let up by now and it was around this time that I checked my pace and found I was sitting a good  seconds faster than my target. A kilometer or so later I was  seconds faster than target  but the effort felt the same! I backed it off a notch and tried to settle around km. As I got to the last  km I was feeling pretty good so I tried to hold on to a km pace and did so without too much fuss. In the last kilometer I picked up the pace a bit more to maintain km. Then I tapped the lap button again and did my km cooldown.I got home had some protein and an ice bath stepped into some compression tights and rested up on the couch for a while. Reviewing the data from the run I found Id done the km section with an average pace of km. Im feeling much better about my potential to achieve my  goal in the marathon in a few weeks after that!,running,chwcidl,16,t5_2qlit

I thought I was going to have to walk the whole way in until I settled down composed myself and said its OK to walk a bit just run until you dont want to and just like that I went from exhausted to doing  runwalking. When I was getting back to training after my last marathon my legs just wouldnt let me do more than a couple miles at once without walk breaks.

1202667,0,t3_27vm0s,This may sound stupid so if it does I am sorry and just disregard me but I think if you can do this will depend on  distinct things Your body type some people no matter how hard they lift and all the protein they take have an incredibly tough time adding muscle and strength. Myself for example have  issue adding muscle and mass if I stop running I use to be  and fairly strong now I am down to  but have tried everything to lose more weight but my body doesnt want to do it so become even faster for me has been really really hard. The second thing is how good of an athlete you really are. Some people are better natural athletes than others due to a variety of factors outside of their control. The third thing is going to be your diet. You must take in enough calories carbs protein so you can gain muscle and still be a productive runner and make gains in that as well very tough to do in my opinion. You might want to take an offseason body builder approach which is bulk up by eating higher calorie high fat high carb foods while doing heavy lifting and very little cardio but still some and then start to cut and trim down. It just SUCKS cutting and is not fun at all. just my  cents,running,ci4x2fv,2,t5_2qlit
1205547,0,t1_ci57orw,Great tips all around. Ive been buying bulk for basics and I make big pots of soup stew or sautee that I subsequently eat for a few days.

And about shoes  I also try to make shoes last as long as possible but my body knees hips usually start hurting from them around the  month mark... current shoes are at  months. Yeah grad school!?.

If you are tired after the first k and youre slowing down or need a break dont worry about what people think since for all they know you could be at the end of k.Lastly remember that how ever far you run you are doing laps around the people at home on the couch.

1228166,0,t3_285ujr,No one has addressed this yet and it might never happen to you but it happens to me... while some people run and feel great afterward the running high I occasionally get the running crash if Ive been nervous or upset over something. Instead of happiness I can finish a run and cry absolutely sob uncontrollably like a small child. If it happens dont worry youll be fine. If youre feeling depressed I just wanted to prepare you though. I hope it never happens and your running makes you feel better. Depending on where you run safely being able to use headphones and your personal preferences try music to power through. I prefer to listen to an audiobook.  It allows me to disconnect and shut off the rest of life for a bit plus I get to finish a bit of the book with every run.  Getting up and out can be hard. Trust me Ive been there and I know what its like to be saddled with a black cloud that you just cant shake. Take it one day at a time one goal at a time. Are you using a training program? Marking off each segment is satisfying to me. Just think Today I will go out and run X distance or for X amount of minutes then I can resume hiding in the bedroom where I feel secure. Throw in some superficial motivation  running burns calories and can help me have a better body.  Im going to be in better shape when I go back to school this fall! Just know that you are never alone in the battle. You can do this. Your SO is a runner and supportive so reporting you progress each time you run might be a good way to cheer yourself on with help. Dont get overwhelmed.  No one who runs woke up one day with no experience no training and went out and ran a marathon. Everyone started at the very beginning too. You can do this. Rock it out. We are all behind you cheering you on even if you cant see or hear us. Head up shoulder back and go kick ass. ,running,ci7sbum,3,t5_2qlit

Ive yet to feel my leg muscles get tired or sore from running except on Wednesdays when I do my HIIT workout. Your feet will be strong. This was a big one for me. Im prone to foot injuries and have ankle instability. Hiking should help with this one too.Your cardio will be good. Youll hike the whole day and your heart will be pretty close to  if youre going at a good pace. All of this said its not a perfect translation. There are many differences between hiking and running although youll find that the two have very similar qualities. Itll slow down your training but not by much.

1490088,0,t3_2b9ccs,Here and here skip past the some of the walking portions are a few training plans you might want to consider. Off the bat I think the biggest thing you need to start doing is running more days a week. You really should shoot for  at the bare minimum otherwise you will not see noticeable gains before your race.Id say its very possible to run a k by September as long as you start training heavily for it now. Keep track of your mileage and be sure to ramp up slowly. And make sure you have good shoes and listen to your body. If anything starts to hurt its time to take a break and maybe cut back. You also should focus on drinking a lot more water and eating more protein and carbs though of course talk with your physician before you change any exercisedietary plans.By end of August I would be shooting for at least  mpw with long runs around  mi and some tempo runs around  but that is just my personal experience. More than anything else this k will mean that you need to focus a lot more on your training and put in valuable miles. Most people could step out their door and manage their way through a k but running  miles could take you anywhere from  min to over an hour depending on your pace and that is a lot of time to spend running.

I had used PayPal to buy the tickets and could not charge back and by some random miracle I stumbled across a classaction lawsuit involving PayPal since they didnt seem to do anything to help the buyers. I sent all my paperwork to some attorney in California and didnt expect much.Three years later I got a check in the mail for . First step was to contact that one little dickbag who claimed I got our refund and didnt return his money to give it back and prove he was a douche.

1510507,0,t3_2bi4yh,I live near Charleston where the event was to be held. Theres pretty significant outrage over this locally. Fortunately people are beginning to realize the Dirty Girl event was a forprofit race that only donates around . of their intake to charity. Per our local news source from the article at gtRod Blackstone senior assistant to Mayor Danny Jones said in an email that an official with the Dirty Girl Mud Runs parent company contacted the city late Monday and said he was working on some of the issues related with the event in Charleston and trying to work on some arrangements with the leaders of Human Movement the producer of the event. gtWe have been told that the companies would like to see if f those issues could be worked out today before the city and Charleston Convention and Visitors Bureau make any final determination about the future of the event in Charleston Blackstone said. As a result we have postponed our meeting to discuss the future of the event until sometime this afternoon. We will let you know when any decision about the event has been made. gtThe citys Convention and Visitors Bureau had announced early Monday that the event had been canceled due to financial issues between Human Movement and Dirty Girl. A spokesman for Human Movement told Eyewitness News it was set to produce the event if the city would waive a  event fee cut it in half or postpone payment. The city then said it would meet Tuesday to try to secure the event for SaturdaySo basically it comes down to the fact that the Dirty Girl Mud Run didnt want to pay the  event fee so they canceled. Absolutely not out of their control.Edit Apparently The Dirty Girl Mud Run Facebook page is also feeling the heat from angry customers. They have deleted and reposted their event cancellation post multiple times an act that is coming off as hiding all the complaints from customers who got screwed.,running,cj5m924,25,t5_2qlit

1515825,0,t3_2bkf8s,Congratulations on running for  minutes! It sound slike youre feeling pretty great about becoming healthier. From my experience keeping active also helps with my asthma so maybe youll see that change too. If youre looking to add running into your life be careful not to do too much too soon. You ask if you should keep up running everyday. If youre a fairly active person anyway it may not be much of a shock to your system but if youre going from sitting on a couch to running everyday it will be very hard on your body and can lead to injury pretty fast.Most people tend to run a few days a week with rest days in between to give your body time to recover. Thats the safe advice. On the other hand youtube is full of videos of people who lost hundreds of pounds by starting to run everyday so I figure as long as you go easy and listen to your body if its hurting youll probably be alright. Maybe cut down the time a bit aim to run  to  minutes every morning if you feel you have to do it everyday to keep motivated. Its hard to hold back when youre so excited about something but you want to make sure that you dont get hurt.Id suggest checking out the moronic monday questions if you can theyre full of good advice for new runners. And remember to check the side bar under web resources the New to Running? page is a really good read that might help you out. Enjoy the running!,running,cj6aa5m,3,t5_2qlit

1666965,0,t3_2dg98q,I ran in my first half a few months ago. To answer your first question my advice is that since you have a few weeks to go dont push it too hard but if you can try and get a  mile run in once or twice. Dont worry about pace on the longer runs try to run at a slower pace than you do on your  mile runs so you can complete the distance. Pace will come with training. Also try to get in some shorter faster runs if you dont already. Mixing up between short and long runs was what helped me go from my longest run ever of  miles to  miles without stopping in about  months.For your second question you really just need to rest the day before the race no need to take more unless you feel you need to. Listen to your body if you are overdoing it pull back a little or take some extra rest.As for other tips You want to eat a good helping of carbs a day or two before the race.  days before I raced I had spaghetti for dinner the day before I had pizza. Both meals for me are way heavier than I normally eat. I dont know if it made a difference or not I didnt feel like I had any more or less energy than I normally do but it seems to be the general consensus among runners to carb up a few days before race day. Dont change up your routine on race day. In that I mean I run in the early morning. I wake up maybe sip a little water and otherwise run on an empty stomach. On my halfmarathon race day I knew it was starting at am...by then Ive already been home showered had breakfast and Im off to work. So I know Id be hungry by the start of race day so in the weeks before the race I worked at getting some food in my system before my run. I started with just having some powerbar energy gels which are like gummy candies. I took a few before I started my run then then a few midrun. The first couple of days my stomach cramped up a bit but I got used to it after a few days and now it doesnt bother me to have some food before or during a run. Runwalk the course well before race day. This made me much more comfortable on knowing what to expect. That way I could pace myself better and know where the hills were. Sure most races include a little map but you wont know what its really like until you run the course. Finally probably the biggest thing for me was to restrain myself at the beginning of the race. My first half was the biggest race both in distance and participation I have ever run. There were a lot of people crowded around the start area and I know my tendency would be to bolt out with the rest of the runners. Dont! I kept telling myself for the first mile or so to hold back. Just like on any normal run work up to your fastest pace dont burn out at the start and then end up walking the last  miles because you have nothing left. Im not fast by any means but in my first half I averaged a mile pace. According to my GPS watch my first two miles were actually around mile and there were plenty of people that blew by me right away as I tried to stick myself towards the start of the first wave. After about the first  miles I had passed every single one of them except for the  that finished in front of me. Most of them were breathing hard or having to slow way down because they overdid it in the first few miles. So I feel the most important advice is to hold back a bit at the start and pace yourself. Dont get caught up with the excitement of going quickly right away work up to your normal pace and you will have a much easier time finishing the race. Also...dont hesitate to slow down at the drink stations. Being my first race I didnt quite think that out and I just grabbed a drink while still running a decent pace and I found that I cannot drink and run that fast without choking myself. ,running,cjpa6tc,2,t5_2qlit

1829506,0,t3_2fi63z,Hi also a high school cross country and track runner here. sophomore year  lbs I plan to make a separate post about this later but what is your personal opinion on Nike shoes? I know that much of the running world does not respect Nike much and I dont know why. Personally as an mildmoderate overpronator I run in the Nike Zoom Structure  and its been working great for me. Ive tried running in a few other shoes so far and they have been providing slight arch pain. More details below.Also have you tried on the new Lunarglide ? If you have what are your thoughts on it? Tried the Nike Lunarglide  and it brought a lot of pain to my right arch despite my feet falling in love with the cushioning. The weird thing was the arch pain was inconsistent. Maybe it was the flywire leaving my midfoot too secureinsecure. Maybe it was the shoe itself not being stable enough but last time I had my gait evaluated I was told I was a very mild overpronator and may actually be able to transition to a neutral shoe someday. Either way I ended up returning it due to the arch pain.I recently bought the New Balance v a mild and lightweight stability shoe. I like the softness and flexibility of the shoe. But during my first test run today I experienced some sharp arch pain in both feet at random times. The pain only occurred  or  times during my recovery run. As I said it was very random and inconsistent. It only occurred when my foot made certain movements usually around sharper turns. Im very unsure of whether I should keep the shoe or return it.Going back to the Lunarglide  do you know if its more supportive than the previous model? If the NB v doesnt work out Ill see over the course of the next  weeks Im planning to try out either the Brooks Ravenna  or the Nike Lunarglide . Currently leaning more towards the Lunarglide  as its around an ounce lighter than the Ravenna and theyre both pretty soft shoes from what Ive heard. And do you know how the two shoes compare in terms of flexibility softness ride etc.Last but not least as it seems Ive already provided you a decent amount of information of myself which shoe would you recommend to me? I am a midforefoot runner for the most part.Sorry for the wall of text and thank you in advance!,running,ck9ncgq,3,t5_2qlit

1928427,0,t3_2goob5,Last year in cross country I learned just how vital hydration can be even at insignificant meets. On a Tuesday my school hosted a trimeet after school no pressure just a scrimmage really. As a low  k runner I decided that I would go for the win despite having some competition not far behind me.Since I didnt think much of this race I never made the effort to hydrate or even take in a significant amount of food that day or the day before. It simply never crossed my mind. So the race begins and I trail out in fourth close to the front pack where I quickly discovered my legs did not want to move. At the second mile two guys took off I didnt have the energy to counter and was now running for third unfortunate but not a huge deal. Our course is well known for having severe hills and thats what tore me apart. By the end of the second mile I was still raving for third but felt more tired than I normally do at the end of a fast race keep moving one more mile! And then with  meters to go I decide to make a move and speed past the other guy big mistake. That little extra surge did me in all speed was almost gone. A little later I was in fourth place coming into the straightaway. Less than one hundred meters left and my legs begin to buckle I collapse to the ground two breaths and I get back up.  steps and Im down again. I crawl a little get back up maybe fifteen walking paces and I once again fall forward. For the last time I got up and collapsed as I crossed the finish.I could not open my eyes or talk almost all muscular control was gone hearing was blurred. Coach took me aside and set me in a chair while others examined me. A few minutes later I was on a stretcher being put into an ambulance. They put  liters of water into me via IV.

1958441,0,t1_ckoejcr,The ITBS mysteriously went away after a two week business trip to Mexico and SF actually.  I had recently been to a sports MDPT and been stretching rolling and on a naproxen regimen and poof gone.  It has stayed away ever since.  This was back in early March just after the half at   I live at  in Guadalajara.  So I had about  months of speed work prior to the half where I was unable to run further than about  miles without ITBS pain but during which I got my mi time down to  or so.  This was running maybe mpw.  Then I had about  weeks of actual marathon training after the half and before the full at the end of April during which I ran about mpw where about  was a long run each week.  I never ran more than  miles in training but I think the strength I gained doing the speed training early in the year helped my confidence.  I pretty much knew going into the marathon that if I kept it easyaerobic for me thats in the s I could run until my legs fell off which ended up being about  miles. D  The first  I ran at about  pace and the last  at about  pace but I finished and I was happy with that.

1972113,0,t1_ckqs9g4,Yes youre definitely fast at shorter distances too  the PRs on your website are amazing.  Do they scale with your marathon times?Heres my entire running history shown in weekly miles  The orange arrows are marathons.  I was totally sedentary before the chart starts.  So I guess it took me about a year and a half but Id been running mpw prettyconsistently for a solid year before ramping up further.  I used Pfitz  for the first two marathons and this time I tried Hansons at the recommendation of a friend of mine.  The Hansons plan recommends  days per week rather than Pfitzs  and suggests running on the rest day if you want to add more miles rather than lengthening the longruns.  I started running on these rest days too and as soon as I was running  days per week it became pretty easy to ramp up the mileage.  Id struggled with knee issues last year but for some reason my body has heldup really well this time around and I attribute that to consistency.  I dont know if Im actually getting any faster but longer fast runs feel easier so perhaps Ill surprise myself at the marathon.Your advice about pacing is very good thanks for reinforcing it!

1974612,0,t1_ckqctos,gt However my argument is Physics WForceDistance. They cover the same distance so requires the same amount of work.As a physicist myself Id just point out in addition to the great discussion that this is a totally incorrect way to go about calculating the work done by biological creatures. Animals are hugely complex machines with all kinds of clever mechanisms to make things more efficient.As an example a simple physical calculation like WForceDistance will tell you that kangaroos cant possibly exist... you calculate how much energy they expend jumping around all day and compare that to their maximum possible food intake. Result kangaroos cant possible eat enough to power themselves.Of course the answer is that a kangaroo isnt just a solid body moving at velocity x and jumping to height y. Kangaroos jump and land with amazing efficiency conserving momentum and absorbing energy from the landing in their springy muscles. Nothing at all like a simple physics model. ,running,ckr52na,1,t5_2qlit

This means a greater chance of injury. Plus I know from experience that up to a certain point you dont explicitly need to train for speed to get faster. Better physical conditioning that comes from more running will do that nicely up to a certain point.

So I started training in midJanuary and then raced a k and a k in February a k in March a  miler in April and then the half was in May.Ill also suggest running with a pace group if you can.

2064259,0,t3_2if5c6,Is your goal to get better at basic speed? Get in shape aerobically? Be a better sprinter? There are lots of different things you could do to achieve each of those goals. If your goal is basic speed then yes short near max sprints would be the way to go. However the way that youre going about them isnt going to be nearly as beneficial as taking a smart approach would be. Realistically a month of training isnt enough time to build up a large workload but you could still start training to improve all of the goals you listed. For basic speed Short near max sprints. Start with  repeats of  seconds with at least  to four minutes recovery in between. The goal isnt to run fast while winded or breathing hard the goal is to run as quick as possible and stimulate new muscle fibers which will allow you over repeated sessions to improve basic speed. For Aerobic endurance Youd see some benefit from getting outside and  jogging easy  times per week. Simple enough as starting with  minutes and building up to  minutes over time. The goal isnt to run hard for these runs just to get out there and run. For being a better sprinter Longer reps of mm would be a large benefit. If you cant get to a track repeats from  seconds you might have heard of interval training would work just fine.

2122104,0,t1_cl964gk,Honestly the biggest thing is just actually making sure you DO warm up before cool down and stretch after and then do some strength training. What you do matters too but IMO less than just taking the time to do something.Warm up for me its some exercises to get the glutes and hip abductors firing hip thrusters leg swings fire hydrants then about a mile of very easy running then into whatever workout Im doing that day.Cool down After a hard workout Ill do a mile of very easy running to cool down followed by some walking just a couple minutes. After an easy run Ill still normally do a little walking.Stretch Hip flexors worlds greatest stretchspiderman stretchlunges calf stretches and quad stretches seem to be the most important for me. Also foam rolling wherever I feel tight.Strengthening Bodyweight squats hip abductor exercises fire hydrants clams glute bridges hip thrusters toe raises core work.When Im keeping up doing all these things I find little nagging injuries dont bother me nearly as muchI think thats because a lot of little nagging injuries are the result of muscle imbalances or are just pain coming from tight muscles that gets worked out by a warmupcooldownstretching.,running,cl9kdjn,3,t5_2qlit

It was a shit day. I felt shitty it was almost dinner when I got in. I couldnt use my left leg for weeks. I was dehydrated to shit and starving. Did I consider myself a marathoner? Fuck. Yes. Some people have this attitude that the running elite consider anything over hours a failure. You want to know who actually thinks that? Assholes. The reality is you knew on for months leading up to the day that you were going to put your body through hell but no matter what you were going to cross that finish line. And what happened on the day? You crossed the line. That attitude makes a marathoner not some numbers you can use to make yourself feel like shit because yours are higher.

2186975,0,t1_clhs093,gotcha. youll hear this a million times on this subreddit im no doctor. however my guess would be possibly a case of runners knee. heres a simple nifty diagram you could take a look at. no matter how slow we think were increasing mileage sometimes its just too quick. if rest alone isnt helping you should employ a consistent icing routine. each night do  minutes on  minutes off  minutes on or some similar variation. if you do continue running back off the pace  I sometimes experience pain above my knee if I push the downhills too much. when I was coming off an extended running break my right medial knee would bother me every single run. not a pain but an injurylike soreness that indicated it would get worse if I didnt intervene. the answer for me was to run  or  weeks without increasing mileage at all stayed just under or at  mpw it was frustrating but it worked and to directly ice the area for  minutes  times a week. getting above  mpw now about  weeks later and am having no issues. be patient and dont give up on running because of this. good luck!,running,clhtftq,1,t5_2qlit

Do some k repeats at k pace  maybe even some miles.When you get to the race that pace should be familiar to your legs so even if youre nervous you shouldnt be going out way too fast. You might be off by  seconds but thats good enough. Once you get through that first mile you can evaluate and make pace adjustments for the second. Then the third mile just give it everything youve got!Dont overthink it though. If youre in good shape you can be off a few seconds at the mile and still run a great race. Just focus on learning your pace so you can get it close then just hammer it the last mile.

2272377,0,t1_cls9m0r,You might want to consider trying to change the way you run. There is quite a lot of evidence now that the pain and injuries that people often get from running are partly or largely related to running style. Specifically the way your foot lands.Google forefoot running. Its basically a running style where you shift the area your foot strikes the ground from the heel of your foot to the middle or front. Most East African runners run this way. It takes some practice but its much more efficient you feel much lighter and stronger running and it apparently reduces the likelihood of injury quite a bit. I gradually changed my running style this year it took a couple of months to get used to but Ive been really happy with how much better running feels now. One big thing is it means you can get away from wearing big heavy structured running shoes that are designed to support your ankle when your heel strikes the ground and instead get some nice lightweight flexible shoes that feel far far better to run in.,running,clsl28t,1,t5_2qlit

Not sure how much of either is attributable to the plan.A couple of thoughts. The FIRST plan involves cross training on days when you dont run. This is not optional. This is something a lot of people dont understand probably because of how the plan is marketed. . Weight lifting is great but it wont count as cross training. Youll need to find something that involves more cardio. If youre just looking to finish you might be able to get away with not doing the cross training but I wouldnt recommend it.You still have a few months before youll need to start the  week plan so Id spend that time slowly building a base. Id also recommend buying the book since theres a lot of good info in there. ,running,clvxypz,1,t5_2qlit

2316647,0,t3_2lrcb2,Hey fellow high schooler here. I broke  two weeks ago at our state meet and ran  today at regionals. Heres my adviceTake advantage of every practice. I dont know how you practice amount pace etc. we usually do  normals runs during a week one kind of interval workout and then a normal run with  minutes or so uptempo in the middle. Watch your pace. Take your pace that would want to run in a race. Im not sure if you want to break  like the title says or  like you mentioned in your post but  is about  pace.  miles and a  second . So to break  your Epace or normal training pace should be anywhere from  seconds slower depending on the time. We have long runs on Sundays.  minutes.  miles. These are usually at about  because meets are saturdays and just the flat out volume of the run. Normal runs in the week are about  minutes. These can be about  seconds slower than your race pace. So about  should be your average pace during these runs. Our interval workouts. These take the piss out of you. You literally have to go to the edge on these workouts. These are what make you stronger. This is what lets you hold on that last mile. It makes you mentally tough and teaches you that you have to trust your training and go to the edge and hold on to it for dear life. Watch your diet. Diet is VERY inportant in going under . In my eyes if you can go under  you are above average. This is my senior year so i was determined to break  and run state. So I went the whole way and for the first time I started watching my diet. No pop watch the fatty and sugary foods. No sitting down and eating half a box of Chips AHoy. I really hope Im not the only one who does that. I get it you run you are starving and you dont stop eating. Find good things to eat. Pasta fruit veggies even granola bars are good for you. Take a multivitamin. These have helped me a lot. Im not exactly sure what it is my mom just bought it and I took it. Want it. You have to want this more than anything else.  is the biggest landmark time to break in ks. Yes  may have been your goal but with decent training and wanting it enough  is easy.  takes that little extra amount of dedication. That extra want to. You have to dedicate your training to it and that needs to drive you. I ran  at WDA our conference meet and I was pissed as hell. But I knew that I could do it. Why? Because I had ran  on the same course  weeks before. In the  week break between that and state I knew I had to get better along with tapering so I wasnt destroyed for the meet. I took advantage of all I had. We had reduced runs the last  days before the meet were no more than  minutes. So I increased my pace slightly. It worked. I ran  at state. Today we went to Nike regionals. Flat course good competition perfect weather. I knew that I could do well here. I worked my ass off the last  weeks thinking of running a  at regionals. I ran a  today and took th in my region. The dream. Senior year. You gotta want it.So thats about all I can give you. You cant really give tips to getting better. Its all about how much you want to get better. If your coach has a different training schedule than mine which he probably does then it will be different. You might not do intervals like we do. Oh well make due with what you have. You have to run like you want to break . It has to be your only goal for the next  weeks. The saying for the Nike Nationals in . Run hungry taste victory. You gotta run like you want to break .Good luck. ,running,cly1wjd,3,t5_2qlit

2351294,0,t3_2m8lzj,I think most of this has been said but Ive got a bit of advice after having run a marathon on Sunday. In no particular order Offer to help out with dropping off  picking up before and after the race. Spousesparents that werent running but came to spectate last weekend were an incredible help for me and my friends running. We could have gotten to the start and back to our car from the finish relatively easily but it would have taken a lot longer and required some extra planning. And also more moving around while we were all tired and sore. Find a good place to spectate and find out if you can hit multiple spots. The boost of someone cheering for you can be a lot of help. Some races even offer shuttles so spectators can watch the race from multiple spots check out if thats available and what the schedule is for that. Dont be in a hurry. Running the marathon can take a long time and then after theres usually some recovery before people are ready to leave. On that note I also wouldnt try to plan anything very ambitious the rest of the day or maybe even the next  my friends and I pretty much spent the rest of the day sitting around eating icing or using the hot tub.Personally I wouldnt want flowers at the end of the race my hands are usually full with watergatoradefoodmedalswagbagsetc. Some people might appreciate the gesture more than I would though.,running,cm2bws4,1,t5_2qlit

Its important to make sure that the majority of your long run miles are run at this easy pace.For more advanced training methods its common to throw in race pace or a short tempo workout into the middle or end of a long run.  For example Higdon has  workouts the first s of the run are at long run pace the last  is at Marathon Pace.  If this is your first time training at these distances I wouldnt worry about this.

2477111,0,t1_cmhw0jj,That sounds good.Your mpw sounds very good. What I would suggest is leaving your  and K alone in terms of lowering the times but rather increase your distances. Your mpw as I said is great but lets say instead of running   and K in a week run    Ks. Dont jump onto that mileage instantly but start increasing the length of the distances instead of trying to cut  minutes off of your K. This provides for better endurance and with that comes better speed. ,running,cmhw8pk,0,t5_2qlit

Being disciplined about taking it easy all the time makes training way less fun for me.So I avoid roads in favor of trails the gnarlier the better to take the repetitive out of repetitive stress injury. But trails are hard to come by in the big city so I end up not doing much running at all.

2618115,0,t3_2pv4ln,Most training plans set you up to peak for the marathon day. Probably your best bet is to repeat the last month before the taper starts repeatedly. It means youll get a few extra  milers in but thats to your advantage if your body can handle the mileage. You might also need to take a down week or two during the repeat to ensure you stay healthy.Dont continue increasing the weekly mileage beyond the max the plan calls for. If anything just keep it steady on the mileage. Your enemy is going to be burn out so dont be afraid to skip a run when you feel like you need to. Its better to go into a marathon slightly undertrained than slightly overtrained. Ideally youd want to switch to a longer Higdon plan.

2710809,0,t3_2r1lcf,Did you update the software on your ? And was the difference in the distance recorded within the allowed  . miles? or just on the routes shown?The running series watches dont have mapping capabilities on them so while they are usually pretty good at recording distances I usually find that the map is sometimes a bit off. Sort of like its is a good at showing me how far I went and how high I climbed its not great at telling me where I did it. But then again I am looking at the map afterwards so I know where I have run so its not a big deal to me. And I have more accuracy with my  and  than I do with my  because of the SmartRecording. I know in the s you can turn off SmartRecording. It causes your battery to die quicker but gets a little more accurate.  One of my favorite things about Garmins as compared to the TomTomNike and even the Timex series is the ability to get software updates.

2718991,0,t3_2r5pel,Just to start a discussion and kind of play devils advocate.  Im not trying to detract data is good on its own sake and Ive always been interested in this.But  how will you use the information gained to your advantage?  To what level of significance is this data different from the estimation formulas that we already have?Is it not clear that  of your running should be done at sub  HR without needing a metabolic assessment?  Is it necessary to know exactly where RQ. is or does your training heart rate line up with recommended training zones such as Maffetone Hadd Friel and Fitzgeralds?gt I also gained an accurate measure of the number of calories that I burn at each pace. This gives me a real number to cross check the results of my GPS watch with. Actually they are pretty accurateHow different are they and to what degree is the difference significant?  Does a  difference make any realistic impact in nutrition?gt Finally I have an accurate measure of how many calories I burn on a daily basis.Do you?  Did you have the mask on for a  hour period?  If not Im not sure how it would have gauged EPOC or negative EPOC in many cases with high mileage training your sleep cycle and lifestyle activities.  It seems to me like most of these commercialized tests fall back on estimates other than the calories measured during activity.gt  it validates a lot of the advice given in the groupIf it makes you more confident in your training that alone proves the value IMO.,running,cnd4yvg,3,t5_2qlit

2798683,0,t3_2s4glg,I have had knee pain  had to stop running for a few months and went through  months of physical therapy. Im back running now and hope to never stop. My main issue or at least one according to the physical therapist was muscle imbalance. So I have exercises and stretches that I still do and will probably maybe if Im good always do to keep my legs in good shape and hopefully not have to go back for more. My dad is around your size. Hes almost  and did have to stop running because of a combination of knee and Achilles pain. The knee problems however were not caused by running. He blew one out in his early s playing basketball or football  I cant remember the story exactly after work. After it was fixed he continued to run and probably managed to do it on and off until about  years ago. The originally injured knee had no cartilage left and the other knee was low on cartilage and plagued by arthritis. He now has one new knee and the other will be replaced soon. If youre having pain in your knees it would probably be good for you to go talk to a doctor or physical therapist. It could be that you have a problem or it could be a simple as needing betterdifferent shoes. Even before I injured myself my knees would get a little sore at the end of a long run when my shoes were at the end of their life. Good luck. If running is what you want to do do what you need to to try to make it happen. Remember that people get injured doing any form of exercise. ,running,cnm77m0,2,t5_2qlit

2821656,0,t3_2seaxz,I just completed my first marathon on Sunday Disney World with the exact same goals youre considering.  I used the Hanson plan and started serious training in Septermber though Id been keeping my mileage up all summer.  Prior to this Id run a couple halfs with my best time at .I set a  goal and used that as my pace for my training runs based on the charts in the Hansons book.  Most easy runs were around a  pace with tempo runs around .  I was very consistent with my training only missing a few easy days when I did other training instead.  I never missed a speed or strength workout or any of the long runs.  I train in a very hilly town and was able to hit my pace even on hills so I was feeling good about the marathon thinking Id be able to get well under the  goal.I completed the marathon with a  time.  The first half was slower than Id expected largely because of the narrow course and the huge number of people I had to work through.  With some more running room I think I would have been on pace for the first half.  I intentionally didnt try for speed during the first half when I knew I had to make up some time but instead just stayed a little bit ahead of my target pace.At the half my time was  so I knew I had to make up at least two minutes over the next half.  I ran a couple miles faster than my usual pace and got ahead of where I needed to be.  The last six miles were a bit slower than my usual pace because I was starting to run out of gas.  I didnt break to a walk at any point other than to drink and I didnt bonk too hard and get a lot of pain on the last five miles.  It definitely didnt feel great but I got through it and managed to hit the time.I think this is probably going to be my lifetime personal best for the marathon.  If I do another I dont know if Ill be able to make the same time commitment for training and I dont know if I want to put my body through the stress of going for that pace again.  I do know if Id gone slow and tried just to finish I probably would want to try again for speed in the future so Im glad I pushed it.,running,cnotdj0,1,t5_2qlit

2870864,0,t3_2sxcha,Hello have a similar issue. Although I think age has an impact on how fast your metabolism may be the principle is the same. Myself this has changed over the years based upon activity level and such. Often wake up starved in the middle of the night and this isnt great for the part of my life that doesnt include running. So I have found a viable strategy for keeping energy up and hunger down. When I increase activity or start up after a break my appetite is out of control too.There are a lot of comments here about more protein I agree with that. But missing here based upon my experience is a good level of fat. Yes fat!  I have found by eating a glob of almond butter or peanut butter when I get these cravings has not only satiated them but given me additional energy.Understandably this flies in the face of so many concepts in the running community I run about  miles per week depending on the season and my goals and since I have integrated the fat things have been incredible. Interestingly foods that are natural in fat are generally fairly high in protein as well. What they dont have is excessive carbs and that has a tremendous impact on hormones liver function as well as waste removal at the cellular level.Bottom line give it a try you will be pleasantly surprised!,running,cnuf252,1,t5_2qlit

2875516,0,t1_cnuxwhj,This is just through my personal experiences but Id go back and restart the same plan. This does a couple of things. One its going to give you a fresh start and allow you a little time to heal up if the last training cycle took a bit out of you. Secondly its going to allow you to better anticipate your training and youll be able to get in better quality runs this time around if a few of them didnt go so well last time. And third youll be able to adjust the schedule accordingly. Meaning youll have more knowledge of what each week is going to take and you can make the schedule fit your needs better. You may see opportunities this time around that you werent aware of such as course specific training or healthier eating practices etc. Im not against finding another plan. I would if the previous one didnt work out well. I however am not a fan of changing training schedules in fear of getting a new one that will cause me to over do it and get injured if Im not paying attention.

Have traditionally been a major carb guy and a few years ago I noticed that I was gaining some extra weight even though I had a steady diet of running  miles per week ands that my caloric intake hadnt changed much nor my overall activity level.I like many runners was schooled in the traditional way and was convinced of the benefits of complex carbs both for fuel and glycogen storage I still think that this is ok especially for elite athletes who need that quick burning fuel for the long haul. But that would be for those in the sub  per mile pace for over  mile events.There are numerous examples of high performance athletes performing at far above average levels whilst consuming a diet more balanced in macronutrientsThere are some cool things above to read and absorb. Timothy Noakes who brought us the de facto bible of running with his amazing Lore of Running book back in  has basically said everything we know about athletic nutrition is crap as it has been pushed mostly by commercial interests.It is time for us an intelligent progressive science based group of athletes to look seriously at the benefits of good fats in our diets. Despite the most common medical suggestions possibly based on profit.This has allowed me to have more good days of running with less injuries. Anecdotal I agree. But I crave junk food less and have a very optimistic view towards the future of nutritional science.,running,cnv7443,2,t5_2qlit

In my experience back of the packers tend to emphasize their own accomplishments too much.  Often the Ultra is too much about them and how courageous they were to try something that honestly they were unprepared for.

Im running to compete and push my own physical limits not to lose weight or look cute or earn back some cupcake calories.As a result I do most of my running dressed in black or grey gym clothes from the boys section of WalMart.  I get really annoyed when the NEW FOR !!! model of a premium running shoe is plastered all over web sites and periodicals...and the only change is that it comes in an even more hideous combination of purplepink.  Im not sure how this makes me feel to be honest.  Or how it should make me feel.  Am I missing out on something by not doing color runs with some girlfriends?  Should I wear makeup and a teal  Lululemon tech shirt so I feel better about myself and run faster?  I definitely feel alienated by things like the cover models on Runners World and by  of the Athleta catalog.  I just try not to let it bother me.   ,running,co5v8gr,5,t5_2qlit

I sometimes call this the Elderly Hispanic Woman Effect after drug trials that find that their drug doesnt have significant effects in the general population but it does significantly help elderly Hispanic women. The trick is you split the population into twenty subgroups young white men young white women elderly white men elderly white women young black men etc in one of those subgroups it will achieve significance by pure chance and so you declare that your drug must just somehow be a perfect fit for elderly Hispanic womens unique body chemistry. This is not always wrong some antihypertensives have notably different efficacy in white versus black populations but it is usually suspicious.What are the chances these researchers picked  and  as their cutoffs beforehand as a hypothesis rather than just hunting hunting hunting for a sketchy correlation conclusion?,running,co9df74,12,t5_2qlit

Lesson learned do NOT run through any amount of pain  it will only make small injuries much worse. I am expected to be able to run again by the end of March which is rough because I generally feel pretty good nowadays but my PT wants me much stronger than I was and thinks else I just risk reinjury. It was tough telling my training partners I couldnt do it. One in particular kept telling me to just suck it up and how he had run a marathon injured before blah blah. I had to stop talking to him until after the Marathon  which I still enjoyed cheering at. I dont regret my decision not to run it at all. If you are injured than you are injured.

3456732,0,t3_2zst2n,Doctor here.  It sounds like you are describing an episode of supraventricular tachycardia or possibly a run of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.  All three are narrow complex tachyarrythmias where for whatever reason the ventricles are depolarizing and contracting normally just too fast.The heart needs time to refill from beat to beat.  If it starts beating too fast it cant fill up enough so it doesnt pump out enough blood   When that happens the pressure in the arterial system drops.  If it drops enough you pass out.You are describing perfectly an episode of SVT.  Things seem normal but your heart starts beating too fast.  This is perceived as palpitations and an ill feeling.  You blood pressure started to drop so you stopped running this actually may have made things a bit worse by suddenly decreasing venous return to your heart.  This led to an even greater drop in blood pressure then unconsciousness as your mean arterial pressure was insufficient to perfuse your brain.When you were on the ground its easier to get blood to your brain and probably whatever was stressing your heart stopped so things when back to normal.If you cath is normal and I bet it will be you may be referred to an electrophysiologist a cardiologist specializing in the conduction system of the heart.  There are odd tests the do to see if there is some oddity with the conduction system of your heart.  Which there may not be this may be a one off and never occur again.I can personally attest though you can get your heart going faster than maximum heart rate.  At then end of the Marine Corps Marathon when you going up the hill toward the Iwo Jima memorial I was really pushing it.  I noticed I was starting to get light headed and glanced down at my HRM heart rate was about .  I started to grey out visual gets grey and visual fields start to contract.  I had to walk for a bit until my heart rate came back below maximum things went back to normal and I was able to finish the race.,running,cpmakgi,6,t5_2qlit

You can pass out from any number of reasons both physical and psychological the times I did get woozy from running were near the end of a long run on a warmer day. Anywho you did the right thing and went to the doctor if they gave you the all clear then thats about all there is for now. One recommendation I would give is if you remember any of the details of the run that made you faint distance pace indooroutdoor weather conditions etc. and the state you were in at the time how rested you were were you super hungry? etc. jot them down. That way if it happens again you can see if there are any sort of similarities in the circumstances.Also this is REALLY GOOD TIME to remind you and anyone who reads this the importance of carrying some sort of identification on you while you run.,running,cpmaovp,2,t5_2qlit

When I first started out running and honestly I havent run in a while... I was a bit chubby. Not like morbidly obese just overweight. One night some asshole drove by while I was jogging pulled his window down and yelled out something like fucking fatass to me before speeding off. It admittedly hurt since I was pretty selfconscious about my weight even though I really wasnt that bad. Like a few seconds later this really cute girl who was jogging ran up beside me and asked if she could join me on the run. And at the end of it she gave me her number and said something encouraging. Im not sure whether she overheard it all or just saw the very sour expression on my face and wanted to cheer me up. Or perhaps she could just tell I was new to running and felt like giving me some encouragement. Regardless it was a nice ending to a pretty shitty encounter.

This can happen to me if I am lazy and leave the toe box too loose because I dont want to pull every part of the lace and then make a super tight knot to compensate.  The knot pushes on the top of your foot and creates a pressure point which can be uncomfy. Knee pain may be unrelated I would see a physician preferably a sports physician if you are actually worried.  ,running,cpqajdq,2,t5_2qlit
3493419,0,t3_307uh6,I PRd my second halfmarathon partly due to a woman on the sidelines at about mile . I was running at a decent clip and if I maintained my speed I would have PRd by  minutes. At mile  or so I started slowing down. My legs hurt I was tired and I was getting pretty bored. I stopped and walked for about  seconds before I saw a woman on the sidelines holding a sign that read Run like you have two legs.Then I noticed she only had one.And I thought Well shit.I smiled waved said Youre awesome and I sucked it up and ran the next  miles and PRd by over  minutes. It hurt like hell and I was tired and cranky by the time I got to the end but I kept telling myself over and over Im gonna do this because there are a lot of people who want to but cant and Ill be damned if I let that woman down.She doesnt even know who I am but that thought has gotten me through a number of races since then.,running,cpqh3ly,16,t5_2qlit

3504519,0,t3_30dorp,Im so frustrated by injuries right now. Ive been trying to qualify for Boston hoping to get in for  but with each passing day hope fades as my current injury lingers. Had plantar fasciitis last summer essentially sidelining me until early September. This didnt give me enough time to get the training miles required for my first serious BQ attempt in November a downhill marathon.  Missed BQ literally by . seconds though I know you really need a couple minutes under to safely get in. I had to walk several times the last  miles because my legs just werent ready if it werent for that Id have BQed easily. The Nov downhill marathon messed up the back of my knee a little bit but it was healing pretty well.  Until I stupidly did  races in  weeks in JanFeb K K  halfs a full.  The last one the full felt pretty good during the race. I missed BQ time by  minutes but wasnt really trying just wanted to gauge my progress and was happy. But the knee problem came back with a vengeance. Almost  weeks later its still bothering me a lot.  I dropped out of one marathon already to focus on another attempt in May.  But Im now starting to think this stupid knee wont be ready by then.  Even if it is how will I get enough training miles when it still hurts now? Theres a possibility of skipping the May marathon they have a transfer policy yay and doing another one in July instead. Its farther away so more travel expenses. Will that be enough time to heal AND train? I dont even know anymore.Maybe its time to accept reality and focus on .  Thanks for letting me whine!,running,cprqnei,1,t5_2qlit

Running not only very literally allows you to give into that internal fight or flight impulse that causes the need to escape but the meditative parts of it also energize and center you mentally in a way that in my opinion prepares or allows you to better confront or fight the stressors that helped motivate the need for escape or flight in the first place.

3530198,0,t1_cpulm43,gt In fact one of the runners I ended up edging out at the last second was supposed to be a half marathon runner but they pointed him the wrong direction. That would suck.By the time I got to the halfmarathon  kk cutoff they had two volunteers loudly calling it it was pretty clear which way to go. But it could have been worse earlier I dont know.They also didnt do a good job of separating the SB vs NB k runners between the two laps until I was starting to head SB  there were some faster runners coming back NB and we danced a little to avoid headon collisions .gt And damn s is a long time. Correct me if Im wrong but that doesnt count toward your time right? Im not counting it . It doesnt count towards net time on the rftiming site. Previously they showed total time which is how I know it was about s but more recently when Ive looked theyd entirely removed that column. Obviously it does affect finish place in terms of order... I finished around  if Id been at the front Id have finished in the s with the same speed. Shrug. I was happy to do betterthanaverage.This is the second k Ive run in the last two years or so. The other was last weekend. I did not taper properly for this race in fact I forgot about it until Friday.gt About the kk results I saw that too. I wondered if maybe they waited for all the k runners to finish before they posted the results? Not sure.So fun story I had actually looked at the results page the night before on my phone and the link was working then. I hadnt closed the tab on my phone and was able to view k results before they restored the link  it was hidden but available if you knew the right URL.gt Anyways congrats on the PR!

3546016,0,t3_30t74y,Perhaps some people become content with their progress and so things seem easier after a while. IE. you work your balls off to be able to run a minute k and then after a few months of continued training you of course can still manage the same speed at much less of the same effort.The fact is as the top comment states if you keep wanting to get better and you keep pushing yourself to see those times get shorter itll continue to be hard. So the real question might be is it acceptable for a runner to decide that he doesnt care about improving any more? My answer would be that that is always up to the runnernoone else can decide that for you. But for me my goal is to get quicker and that will never change.,running,cpwgvko,1,t5_2qlit

About the best advice Ive been given in that situation is that if I light up then not only do I have this tragedy to deal with but Ive compounded my problems by adding smoking back into my life.  I use this same logic for running. I dont always enjoy running but when I dont do my planned run no matter the reason I feel worse. As an added bonus I cant remember a time where a good run didnt at least make me feel better after it was done.  Now the corny part for me is that when I run I often find my mind wandering to people Ive lost. Im not sure why I do this more than likely its because I started running for health reasons. I run to be heart healthy. Maybe its something else maybe I just never really dealt with the loss but while Im running my mind decides that then would be a good time to go ahead and meditate on that a little bit. Who knows but running is time that I spend with my lost loved ones. When I lose someone now they become part of my running pack. ,running,cpxfq45,1,t5_2qlit

Right now I have about  pairs of shoes in my rotation and it wouldnt really be that feasible for me to keep mileage counts on all of them.   Different runners wear out shoes in very different ways depending on pace weight terrain and other variables.  If the shoes are feeling like they have lost their bounce during long runs its time for something new.  If they still feel springy and alive I dont see why you need to pull them out of your rotation but it wouldnt be a bad idea to spread the miles across more than one pair.

3704866,0,t3_32rlbf,You dont have to add mileage to get faster but it is generally the most efficient way to get faster especially for longer distances like the marathon.As others have mentioned speed work sleep nutrition strength training and other things can all contribute to you becoming faster.  Those things are normally less effective than piling on more mileage but if you are limited in the amount of mileage you can add then by all means focus more on those things.In another reply you mentioned that you tweaked pfitz  to lower the midweek mileage while leaving the long runs untouched.  I dont think that is the most effective option.  You reach a point of diminishing returns with long runs which is why plans like hanson cap it at  miles.If your reduced mileage version of Pfitz had a hypothetical  mile week of a miler and five milers I would rearrange that to be one miler two milers and two milers with an additional rest day.  But I think other peoples advice about just trying a different training plan could be valuable too.  Sometimes monotony is the problem.  ,running,cqekvhi,0,t5_2qlit

Foam roller glute strengthening exercises and very very slow buildup back to marathon training distances were key for me.I guess theres varying degrees of severity as with most injuries but for me it was many weeks before I could run anything close to a marathon. Heres what my recovery looked like as a graphHeres a bit of detail behind my specific recoveryI know its probably not the kind of info you were hoping for but I thought itd be worthwhile sharing. If youre able to hit .k before pain sets in maybe theres still hope I couldnt do more than .k when my ITB was at its worst. Its probably worth noting that Im about  years older than you  with luck theres some truth to the old young bodies heal quickly adage. Hope your recovery goes well and fast  good luck in London wish I could be there!Oh I suppose I should elaborate on how to build back up to long distances. Youll probably be paranoid about the affected area for a while so any little twinge might have you getting worried that its all gone to hell again. Establish a mental pain scale  something along the lines of   discomfort   isolated but minimal pain   serious concern   couldnt continue even if I wanted apologies its a bit clunky to try to explain and is still a bit ambiguous. DONT GO PAST . If you get to  you have to stop or youll only make things worse. Its important to find that limit but not to push beyond it.

I think I probably have undertrained a bit heres my strava and have neglected my weekly long runs a bit due to working final year PhD  hour weeks conferences etc!  I think  hours is maybe a conservative aim and realistically I should be able to go quicker but for a first marathon I think its a good time  and dont want to aim too high and end up disappointed!

I also now have some muscle tone I lost  pounds a couple years ago but it was all diet.  Running has helped my physique and build  Increased libido and also my running and fitness increased my wifes libido   it sounds crazy to say aloud but its been a definite benefit! I can relax my previouslystrict diet somewhat since I now burn about  more calories a month so treat myself to a real Coke  times a month eat a bit more pasta etc I sleep better.  WAAAAY better. I have more energy when I am awake. I challenge my kids to runplay soccerride bikes since they see me active I run alone and enjoy my newfound ME time for  minutes  days a week I wish I could say I have some time to think but I am scatterbrained when I run.  This has actually become a blessing since it gives me some time to NOT have to think about anything some unproductive brain time.  Consequently I have random great ideas pop into my crazy thoughts even if theyre generally disorganized and unproductive. I was never competitive before.  Running races has given me goals and I like wanting to smoke the times of coworkersfriends who I know run as well.  Its friendly competition.  Shoes and clothes and race fees cost money but now I maybe spend  a year on new shows and a couple races.

3842328,0,t3_34dyez,This applies more to after taking up triathlon than running alone but its true for both cases. I noticed that I didnt just lose fat my body changed shape altogether. All the stabilization muscles that get used just a little bit all got their first workouts in a long while. It changed my posture how I move and holds what little remaining fat I have in a more appealing overall shape.Another major thing I noticed was that I became better at temperature regulation Im comfortable at a wider range of temperatures than most people and generally prefer a colder room which saves energy in my climate.I think mosquitos bother me less now too. I dont know why. Maybe my body has become more efficient and I expel less carbon dioxide to attract them or maybe all the sweating washes away the oils that give off a human smell.

I read that a few things can cause inaccurate GPS.  low battery  Bluetooth on and or WiFi on different apps have different methods of figuring out where we are if the GPS gets spotty. Some apps will grab data from previous tracked runs from other users and make it up.Other apps will track points and draw lines between them even if you didnt actually step that way. In that case  look back at the map and see if the lines are jagged. If so GPS was poorly tracked.

4002920,0,t3_36a0gu,It is all about race mentality.Ill tell you what I tell my runners.  Run to win the race.  Assuming your coach seeds you at a time you can realistically run you can race with the guys around you.  Winning your heat is the best thing you can do for yourself.  Us coaches are worried about times you guys worry about winning races.  The times will come along with winsAnother trick is learning to run the race.  I train my guys to run the first half of every race whether it be the or  to use the first half of the race to set up the last half.  If you have a great kick then sit yourself behind the guys in front of you and go with  to go.  If you have no kick then get aggressive at  meters to go and start picking people off.  As long as youre set up well after the first  youll be ready for the last half.  Another quote that my college coach told me that has never left me and hopefully will never leave my athletes is the rail is for two people the guy in front and the guys who have given up.  What that means is you cant be engaged in the race if people are outside of you.  They are making the moves that you should be. Hope you see this and hope it helps. ,running,crckbgr,2,t5_2qlit

4132810,0,t3_380sa0,If you only have a few days then there isnt a training that can be done to get yourself prepped. Just do what you need to to feel comfortable! Do an easy mile or two and some strides for a workout tomorrow warm up pretty well before the race eat a ton of carbs today and tomorrow and get a good amount of water in too. Make sure youre adequately fed and hydrated to your comfort level on race day and get in the zone. Try not to psych yourself out with the pressure though! Thinking about it too much and worrying will raise your cortisol and might hurt your performance if youre a little frieked. Just try to visualize crossing that line and seeing a big ol  on the clock as you cross the line every once and awhile. In terms of race strategy that too is largely dependent on your comfort zonerunning type. Im a  kind of runner so I like to open hard for the first  laps back off a little and then finish with a hard  at that distance. Mixing it up with other guys on the track also really moves me like were doing intervals and makes me comfortable. Ive heard that for a lot of people though the most efficient way to slay the race is to pick a speed for your laps and to keep plugging away at a steady pace with a   mentality. Thats all Ive got on the topic! You should also probably talk it over with your coach and see what advice they have for you. They know you personally and can probably give you some advice that works better than any of us anonymous folks on the internet hehe!Best of luck in the race!

Starting in January I was getting up super early to go over to my friends house to workout with him. He is physical fitness man and I am wimpy girl so it was nice to have someone coaching me along. Due to child custody issues we would run five days then the next week do weights for five days. At first this was pretty good for me besides the fact that by friday on run weeks I was exhausted and did terribly. But I peaked in march time wise  minute mile must be a record for slow PR and actually got worse after that.  minute miles couldnt force myself to run solid but slow and not take walk breaks. My workout buddy got very impatient with me and I am impatient with myself. Now its summer so I dont have to work and I am trying to do some better base building stuff. But geeze when I run slow enough that I dont get winded it feels really slow. And distance  pathetic. Im talking barely a mile or mile and a half. So question am I just doing this all wrong? Is that why I stopped getting better? Or is there something going on head wise thats maybe holding me back? ,running,cru4zxw,3,t5_2qlit

4164735,0,t3_38glte,I went into Higdons Intermediate plan with a  K and posted a  marathon on a tough course I bet I wouldve been around  on something a little more neutral. I also pushed Higdons runs hard like sub  minute pace on everything but the longest runs and I was close to  on those too because I was initially hoping for a sub  hour. Clearly it did not get me where I wanted. I also didnt love the plan in general. It lacked direction didnt include a long enough training run for my tastes I wouldve been better served with a  miler because theres a big Wall between  and  and did not include speed work. I cant speak for the possibility of making Boston but I can say with some confidence that Higdons plan probably wont do it for you. Also unlike a K youll want to back load your longer runs. That means negative splitting. Ex you want to run  miles in  minutes. You run the first  miles in  minutes and the last two miles in  minutes. Marathons are about planning and maintenance not digging deep and seeing what you have in the tank. Its basically physically impossible to have extra energy after a marathon because you will have used up all your glycogen. This means you have to manage when where and how you will run out of steam and know in advance how you will respond.Also my race felt almost surreal for much of the run. I was so well trained that it was kind of no big deal. That was just how I spent my Sundays. Thats the level you want to be at. So well prepped that you cant not do it.Great luck with your training.

End of the story was my calves hated me for over a week. It was easly the worst DOMS I ever got.Do I my feet etc. feel stronger? Guess I dont feel any different then when I was running normaly. Never paid much thought to that.The main benefit for me is that my knee is not acting up anymore yet. By now I am of the opinion everyone should just stick with what the like what works for them. If you run in traditional shoes and dont have any problems stick with it If you are running minimalist and have no issues go for it. You just gotta try out what works for you.From your comments it sounds you alrdy are used to FF and only starting with running. So Id say just go for it. Try if it works for you. Just be mindful of form and intensity and up it slowly. To get a better feel for minimalist runnning you could always check out different guides on forefoot running. Also try running on smooth concrete barefoot to get  a better feel for it the FF can be give you a false feel since they still give your foot a feeling of safety which can trick you to run different.,running,crwb9cy,3,t5_2qlit

All the research I found suggested exercise whilst it has multiple positive affects on your body isnt necessary for weight loss.Its all about diet. And when I say diet I mean your long term foodlifestyle not a week program or some other shit that will have you back to your original weight in a few years.Start by cutting sugar or at least added sugar. Cut polyunsaturated fats to bring your Omega Omega  balance back to something good. Read up on actual research on Google Scholar not Dr Oz sorry I assume youre an American. Dont trust miracle cures. Dont take supplements unless you can spell the ingredients. There is a world of advice out there but also a world of misinformation.

I have a hard time determining exactly what factors led to my fitness at that time. Was there something special about going lowmod carb? Was it cutting out foods with preservatives? Perhaps just subbing heaps of veggies in for ricebreadpasta gave me additional nutrition? Switching from beer to wine and lessening alcohol consumption? Maybe it was just the benefit of losing about  lbs of fat.

4370832,0,t3_3b2hjo,I swim a LOT more than I run so I dont have the on my feet part of the issue you do but I can relate to a lot of what youre asking.  I work an office job for a Fortune  company not as impressive as it sounds Ive been married for just why of . years and we have a . month old child  mediumlarge dogs and  cats.  When Im in heavy training for an event I probably swim  hours a week.I swim in the morning before work.  This means I get up very early and consequently go to bed early as well.  Once you get in a routine of it getting through the day for me is usually manageable.  I understand that working an office job is probably a lot less physical than your job.One of the keys for me is an understanding wife.  We work nominally the same schedule so if we can both escape at similar times we still manage to see each other at night.  I do a lot of household chores in the evenings and on the weekend which probably curries more favor for her to let me swim.  She also understands that Im more likely to be in a better mood if I get to swim.Another key is making my workout a priority.  I dont think anyone actually likes getting up at am.  Im a morning person but even that is earlier than my body would actually prefer to get out of bed.  But if I want to get a good workout in that is the time of day that I can and still spend time with my family.

I recently ran trudged the Vertical K a race up White Face Mountain and thought my squats would help.  Nope.  Squats dont hit all the muscles you need for hills like calves for example which mine were quickly destroyed nor do they help with your cardio.

4516611,0,t1_cszqro9,My guess is that a significant limiting factor for we cyclists who are beginning runners is that the muscles that are used more in running than in cycling are less efficient at oxygen uptake fewer mitochondria and less strong so that they need more oxygen than a trained runner and fatigue more quickly. That will change as you run more.One interesting thing I have found contrariwise is that running as cross training has lowered my heart rate when cycling. My average HR during runs is usually somewhere in the s. It was  during my last K race which is about  of my maximum. My average HR for a spirited but not all out ride used to be in the s too but these days its more in the s even though Im going faster.

If Im walking or standing or running it doesnt bother me or certainly doesnt hurt. Because mine seems to be lower on the heel bone and because it only seems to hurt in the morning or after resting I suspect it is plantar fasciitis because those are all symptoms of that and the fact that stretching and massaging my plantar fascia seems to relieve all my pain and stiffness instantly.Yours sounds like it is probably achilles tendonitis or some other achilles related problem but if you want try stretching massaging your plantar fascia and see if that does anything for it it couldnt hurt and maybe it will help you too.,running,ct3rkzz,0,t5_2qlit

Now days with some training base a nonselfdelusional easy pace  and not feeling locked in Id consider following a plan and adjusting it if it felt too intense. Ive readenjoyed Fitzgeralds  running and own Daniels Running Formula but found that it reads far too much like a reference manual but have considered basing my training off one of Daniels intermediate plans.

The tone is keeping with the BSP post but its hardly proportionate to the gravity of the offense or its implication for the future of BSP.  The AT was around for a long time before Scotts run and it will be around for a long time after no one remembers who he is or that he once popped a bottle of champagne on a mountaintop.  The littering ticket is an interesting wrinkle but its not worthy of the histrionics.

4612919,0,t1_ctc17d1,Id imagine the massive to marginal change varies from person to person depending on their abilities and goals.

Third year running  mpw and so on. Ive hit a few  mile weeks but I still bounce between  mpw. My guess is that the gains become marginal when you feel like your race performances are acceptable and are close to what you expect of yourself. I am a huge fan of doing mostly easy miles and its really helped keep me injury free and improving.

4693989,0,t3_3f81j0,Based on your times and background you lack aerobic fitness. If you can run a   but only a   mile you have some decent speed but your aerobic system needs work. What you can do is increase your mileage during the offseason aka right now to about  mpw. Tempo runs once a week are also important which can be done maybe  secondsmi slower than your  mile pace. Id focus on shorter ones right now  miles max but as your fitness improves the distance can increase as well. You may not see instant gains but if you keep training consistently you will see improvement in the long term. Also worth considering is your body development as plenty of boys literally become men over the course of their HS career and suddenly drop minutes off of their times. But most of the time putting in more mileage and identifying the right workout for you and no not all athletes respond well to the same kind of workout will result in improvement. Good luck.

4753847,0,t3_3fztl3,I hope this doesnt get too buried but I have three questionsIm running the Chicago Marathon in October and Im following Hal Higdon Advanced II for training. Ive been doing well with it and keeping to it for the most part but Im a little stuck on how to do my long run this weekend. It calls for a half marathon race.If I were going to race a half marathon Id go out and try to run it at maybe a  pace. If I were going to do it as just a training run Id probably do  which would be much less strenuous on my body. I dont have a race persay this weekend but I kinda still want to try to run it at a blistering pace.  is still quick for a half marathon for me and I might not be able to do  but if it were a race thats what Id be trying for. Thoughts?Secondly Ive always cramped up quite spectacularly around mile  on marathons. Ive had one race where I didnt and it was Disney of this year. I wasnt going particularly fast and I just kept at it. I think the slower pace helped. Running a  miler at an  pace in training? No problemo. I dont even feel the cramps coming on after  in training. The race? Different story.Ive heard some good things about salt tablets and want to give them a try. Which ones should I go with and how many should I expect to take during a marathon?Lastly and this relates to the cramps Ive been debating doing a training run greater than  miles just to see ifwhere I cramp up at. Most training plans cap at ...but I really feel like I would benefit from going further. Even moreso then Id know where to take the salt tabs. Should I go a little further? Maybe ? . even?Any advice is appreciated!,running,cttrney,2,t5_2qlit

4824604,0,t3_3gyh7y,Hi! Awesome that you want to get into running. I see from the other comments that youre already got a few recommendations about shopping in Sweden so Ill just tell you what helped me getting into a running habit.  and most importantly the hardest part is getting out of the door  for me its definitely  of the effort. After Ive warmed up a bit I usually enjoy it except if  my foot hurts or my thighs rub  it happens to me too. Definitely definitely go to a running shop and invest in a good pair of shoes and a sports bra! It will make such a difference.  to keep the movitation up I track my runs on an app. I use nike and its really motivating to monitor my progress. Ive set myself a monthly goal and have managed to stick with it. You can also invite friends and see how much theyre running if thats what you like. Getting a running partner helps as well I got running about once a week with someone. If theyre the same speed great if theyre faster they can always spring ahead and jog back or go for an extra loop afterwards. I also enjoy listening to podcasts while I run because like that I feel like Im learning something and it helps distract me.  its perfectly okay to walk if youre feeling tired walking is still better than sitting on the couch. Remember youre doing it for yourself and you dont need to impress anyone. Crosstraining e.g. with low impact sports such as swimming cycling pilates will also help improve your overall fitness and is gentle on your joints. Good luck with your shopping and your running journey!!,running,cu2oia7,2,t5_2qlit

Your body is trying to adjust to the activity that you are putting it through. If the knee pain is a  very simple bit of agitation youll more than likely be alright continuing to run with it. However if it hinders your ability to run normally or walk correctly then rest must be taken. Running is a fine balance between pushing the boundary between injury and progress.

Some people few though are naturally fast. Most of the folks you hear from here have been running for years. They put in the hopefully not blood sweat and tears to get there! How do you know your HR zones? The best way to test your HR is to sprint up a hill and take measurement. Then after a cooldown do it again. Take the higher as your max.      You say you were not as winded on the second night. May be you should slow down a bit more by shortening your steps. Or take walking breaks.     You might want to look into Ck.

Just imagine that you have made some great progress everything are going great you love to run and then suddenly you have to stop running completly for a month. You did too much too fast. It sucks. It happened to me and it happens to lots of new but also some more experienced runners every year. The best thing you can do to avoid it is to build a great foundation. Build a good base of slow miles before you start to add intervals etc.  times a week is not a definete number. You have to listen to your body and make your own choices. One rule that most runners agree on is to not increase your weekly milage more than  for each week. Or a few miles in the first weeks if you are starting very low.

Just dont wear running shorts! Some sort of skort would make that area even more private for you and obviously will look more feminine. Full length compression pants are common for all genders doubly so if the weather is chilly so theyre a nobrainer if youre uncomfortable about anything to do with your legs.Also Id definitely not recommend packing it in too tightly when running.

As far as the race goes the only lines I ran into was the rope wall which makes sense since only one person could go at once. But every obstacle where you needed teamwork to get through there were people helping. All the people I encountered were super friendly and after the initial start the paths were pretty open. But then again this could be location based. I did mine in the middle of ohio which could have had something to do with it.

5174953,0,t1_cv9km41,The general consensus around here seems to be that you dont lose much for anything less than a week. Ive taken two separate weeks off over the past year where I went mountain climbing and I didnt run at all both times I came back faster primarily because I need a stepback week to rest and recover from hard training. So if I were you Id step up the intensity a bit before the conference and then only try and sneak one run over the  days. reddyrunfaster suggestion is probably the best bet but I wouldnt be too worried about  days whatever you decide.,running,cv9rsvb,1,t5_2qlit

5245571,0,t3_3mif18,The girlfriend and I were there.  We came up from Virginia for the weekend.  Ive got a good  runs under my belt.  I have been a fan of The Oatmeal for as long as I can remember and this was an especially exciting event to be a part of.  Unfortunately it was the most poorly executed endurance event that I have ever seen...and Im a positive guy.  Our satellite bus driver got lost on the way from the parking lot to the run and had to get directions from a rider after he was obviously wandering aimlessly.  Okay no biggie kinda funny.  No water or snacks before the run...okay no biggie sometimes they have that sometimes not.  Oh its entirely an extremely technical single track mountain bike trail...not a portions will be a trail run...unexpected and difficult but challenging and unique...sure I suppose I can handle that.  Now loop it back around so that the entire k field of participants end up in front of fast moving  marathon participants...on single track straight up and down over rocks and roots  total fn chaos anger blood and negativity.  Thats not why I run or enjoy these events.  I even like obstacle events but I go into those knowing what to expect.  I saw more than one person hit the ground face first.  I heard yelling and crying I was pushed.  There was no accounting for the safety of the runners who got themselves in way over their head.  Thats not cool in my book.  Safety first then teamwork.  If youre going to hold an event in a place like this some far better warning needed to go out.  The line of  people at the medic tent at the end should have sent this message loud and clear I hope.  It takes a village to screw up so I hate to lay blame or be purely negative.  It just could have been handled so much better with more attention to those important details to keep people safe.       ,running,cvia3ql,1,t5_2qlit

Youll find yourself fitter and quicker over the shorter distances so when you next go out your slower pace will be a bit quicker than last time.

I know Ive been having great success on my own plan that is  as well which includes intervals and tempos.

5371740,0,t3_3ollzo,As others have said its not a super idea. However it sounds like youre going to do it so Im going to offer my advice.  Walk during the timed race before you feel the need to walk. This will delay fatigue for as long as possible. Sometime like a  minute run  minute walk may be comfortable.  Consume protein during the event and after. This will hopefully spare your body from using muscle protein as a fuel source and help prevent muscle breakdown. Dont worry about your speed. Keep it nice and relaxed.  Know that if you run more than...probably  miles youre likely adding time to your marathon in  weeks. If youre ok with this keep going. If not Id suggest the most you run be in that range to not negatively impact your marathon. ,running,cvyatfw,1,t5_2qlit

Theres a lot of simple carbohydrates in the fruit that will digest quickly and help give her energy but it doesnt have the staying power of protein fats and complex carbs that youd expect from a wellbalanced meal.Carboloading is also a real thing  eating lots of carbs in the day or two before a race will help replenish your muscles glycogen stores which is one of the main sources of fuel your muscles pull from during a run.But a lot of it is also just trial and error. She needs to figure out what works for her. Obviously what she did yesterday was not what works for her.

5401743,0,t3_3p0mw2,Assuming your nutrition sleep etc. are in order then perhaps you need to take a look at the way in which youre training.This might sound crazy but you should run more.  I was in a similar position once.  Just going out and running the same distance every day takes a toll over time.  Each run is the same old slog that never seems to get any easier.  Theyre all equally difficult.  Try integrating a weekly long run into your schedule.  If it takes you  minutes to run  miles then try a run of say  or more minutes at a slow easy pace.  Keep extending it every few weeks.  Youll get faster over the shorter distances and your endurance will be enhanced greatly.  Along with a new perspective there are both physical and psychological benefits to be gained from the long run.EDIT grammar,running,cw24ryy,2,t5_2qlit

5492965,0,t3_3qbb8v,Sorry to hear about your day out there.  A DNF is a tough pill to swallow especially if not stemming from injury or other circumstances that you feel truly warranted it.  Ive completed about  ultras from about .  Ive DNFd three times  twice at the White River  miler finished twice and once at the Mt. Si  miler finished multiple times.  White River DNF  was a case of finishing the previous year having a good training period leaidng up to the next year then going out too fast and bombing out at mile .  Could have just as easily power walked it to an under the cutoff  hour finish though.  So that sucked and should have been a finish.  WR DNF  was a case of experimenting with an all liquid supplementation plan including trying Hammer Heed and other stuff that didnt sit well puking a lot and dropping at mile  again.  Maybe could have sat a while abandoned my supplement plan ate some real food and kept going.  So that sucked and likely should have been a finish.  Mt. Si DNF was an ITB issue that I think came up from running multiple ultras over the course of the previous few months and it was painful to even continue walking.  I dont fret over that too much as it was really the events leading up to that and not anything in particular I did in the race itself.  That should not have been a finish.  I didnt race again for six months to make sure all was well and actually took up road cycling for a change of pace.Ive learned a lot about myself and running in general through ultras.  Theres so much time and distance for things to go wrong and its a good measure on your ability to prepare adapt and overcome.  All that said when it goes right it really feels good.  The best run I think Ive ever had was a  mile affair that saw me running in  degree temps in central WA during the day to near  degrees and pouring rain that night across the Yakima Army range.  Physically I had prepared very well but had to overcome some unexpected issues did so and mentally was rewarded with a calm otherwise uneventful outing.I used to live in western Washington but moved to the Houston area in .  Ive since hung up ultras until such a time hopefully that I can move back.  Ive never been a very good distance runner in heat and especially so with the humidity of this area.  Plus Im not really enamored with the trails of this region.

5648685,0,t3_3sg6w6,I started off extremely slow but Im lightyears ahead of where I was when I first began almost  years ago. I started off just walking around the block. I was severely out of shape About Lbs and broke a sweat doing almost any sort of physical activity. Over time my walks got longer and once I reached a point where I want losing anymore weight about Lbs I realized that I was going to have to work harder at it to see progress. Getting my diet in check was a huge part of losing weight but increasing the amount of physical activity I do has had a great impact on how my body feels overall. After a few years of simply walking I introduced short jogs into my routine. I was wearing cheap sneakers and had to replace them every few months. I would walk  days a week and jog for  minutes every other day or so. Soon I was jogging for  and walking for  minutes. Once I decided to join the Army I knew I was going to have to work on my running to meet the physical fitness requirements. It was a slow process but having a goal was probably the biggest factor in becoming a proficient runner. The Army also introduced me to interval training jogging or walking for a short time and then topspeed sprints for half the time spent walkingjogging. The basic version of this type of training is called s where you sprint for  seconds and walk for . This type of training is intended to improve your basic running pace as it builds up your running muscles and endurance.There were also a few small factors that made big improvements in my running. I bought clothes specific to working out  running and made sure I had a way to listen to music  podcasts as I ran. I would try to find new places to run to keep things interesting and soon developed a few favorite routines and trails. Dont make the same mistake I did and skimp on your running shoes. I used to buy cheap  sneakers and now I buy  shoes with insoles intended for high intensity running. The cheap shoes I had been wearing gave me a stress fracture that took months to heal. I also continued to run with this stress fracture which only prolonged the healing process. I have never experienced this problem with real running shoes. I also recommend spending some time researching exactly what a proper running form is. I didnt figure this out until way after I began. You could end up not being as efficient in runs if youre not using a proper form. Also learning how to breathe while running will help you immensely. Ideally you should be able to breathe fairly normally. If youre out of breath you are probably running too fast.I am now in my mids and I continue to run. My run times are nowhere near professional athlete times but I can definitely run further and faster than most people I know including those who would consider themselves in shape. Ive also lost over  pounds and am now focusing on getting down to a BMI of about  Currently . Im a guy so female BMI goals will likely be different. Running isnt the only thing I do but its my main form of cardio exercise.If I could do it all over again I would probably try to push myself into running a lot sooner than I did. Its a great way to burn calories and keep your daily energy up. Its also a huge stress reliever and a great way to spend your time away from the couch or computer chair. I have no doubt that you will see great improvements in your life if you simply keep up the motivation to keep running but if youre like me you may be in for a long battle.,running,cwx9vqo,1,t5_2qlit

There werent a lot of full marathon runners  most of the time I could only see one or two other runners. The aid stations were a bit unevenly placed and some of them only had Gatorade its a good thing I brought a water bottle along. I didnt eat cake while running to avoid stomach issues but fortunately they had cake at the finish although not when I actually finished.It was annoying when the marathon met up with the half near the end and I spent the last few miles dodging walkers some of whom were oblivious that some people were trying to run a race.I kept expecting to be chased by people in a Blerch costume.I probably wouldnt do the full marathon again although I might do the half or K just for fun next year.

5684812,0,t3_3syk5b,Ive had to do this twice in the past few years.The first time I had IT issues for three months or so and then returned to running much to fast only to get the worst shin splints Ive ever experienced and be out for another several months. The second is just ended nowI had various issues in my knee that required some orthopedic work. Im only now getting back into the mileage.Theres a couple of pieces of advice Id give.First make sure whatever cross training youre doing isnt injuring you in some other way. When I was first injured I still had dreams of a BQ in my head and jumped straight into long distance biking to stay in shape which exacerbated my knee and helped to develop the previously mentioned shin splints. Second just dont be hard on yourself. Depending on how long you were out youre going to be slower for it or have a harder time on the distances that used to be easy and thatll really suck. Try to remember why you started runningthe things you enjoyed about it before. ,running,cx1r816,1,t5_2qlit

Personally Id only try to run it hard occasionally and Im sure youll notice the average come down because youll have more training in between attempts and youll be well rested from taking it easy for the majority of your training runs. The general advice around here of just running more at a comfortable pace would allow you to get a lot faster. If youre able adding another training day would probably help a lot and so would making one of your runs a long run Id work one run up to  or k.

Easy runs should be kept in your aerobic zone in order to build a solid endurance foundation.  They should comprise about  of your training.  The remainder of your training mileage should be split up into  quality speed workouts per week where you run intervalsrepeats at not faster or slower than your marathon threshold vmax and anaerobic paces.

Lesson learned hopefully quickly enough that you dont get injured.gt  Whats the purpose of this running style?In general many people who heel strike are overstriding. Switching to the forefoot is normally a result of shortening the stride length.That said its possible to heel strike and not overstride and its possible to forefoot strike and overstride.gt Stretch a little before and after. I read recently somewhere that stretching isnt important huh? but for me it is definitely necessary so I do it before and after.If youre doing walkrun then youre easing pretty gently in into anyway.My normal hard session starts with a few laps easy jog then drills  dynamic stretches. Then the session. Then a few easy laps. Then static stretches and conditioning.For a steady run Ill go easy for the first half milemile and then run at the intended pace. The last milehalf mile will then also be easier.Static stretching is discouraged before a session  its actually quite damaging on a muscular level so doing it before a workout is generally not recommended. Doing it separately or afterwards is the current recommendation.Dynamic stretching amp drills is different  in general its more focused on running form than flexibility.,running,cy10an4,2,t5_2qlit

5980693,0,t1_cy3f146,Well said. There is so much anger aimed towards Lance its a bit silly. People need to learn to let go of the hate but nobody is asking you to forget. Obviously what he did was wrong he was punished stripped of medals lost sponsors and received a lifetime WADA ban. And most importantly his name and reputation are forever tarnished. No matter what he does for the remainder of his life he will always be a cheater and have this heavy burden on his shoulders.In  so far Lance logged  miles running and  miles on bike on Strava alone. Why does he keep doing it? Because is he is cyclist  runner by heart. Its who he is. This is running after all and we all love running and being fit. Most of us also love racing and running events. We treasure our running bibs and we treasure memories from our races even more. Well guess what? So does Lance. I bet he loved to race more than any of us and I bet its killing him that he is unable to attend cool events like Ironman for example. The man is  years old and his glory days are over. No need to shit over him when he attends some event here and there that he is not banned from.

6003451,0,t3_3xnncv,I also wonder what was your longest training run for this race? Did you follow a training plan if so what plan? Had you tried out any nutrition or hydration during any training runs? Also what was your pace or pacing strategy especially in comparison to training runs?Fatigue setting in and slowing your pace at only mile  indicates that this could easily be a  lack of trainingendurance issue and a problem with your current fitness level not being up to a good level for a half. It doesnt sound much like a fueling issue or the wallbonking or even a bad run if difficulties set in at mile . I ask about pace and pacing strategy because if you dont have a pacing strategy for a half it is very easy to get caught up in the moment and run way too quickly for the first few miles and burn outblow up as a result. This is especially a risk if this was your first race I seem to remember that it was? and if you werent prepared for it feeling like you can go so much faster than is actually sustainable and still making sure to not fall for that and to slow yourself down when youre caught up in the speedy crowd start and most ppl are also starting out way too fast around you that could easily explain fatigue and slowing down at mile  and being done at mile . The dead end back of a k race I did started at  min miles then slowed down to  min miles and kept slowing and slowing because they started way too quickly for their abilities. I was the very last person for the first quarter mile because I was refusing to let those ppl mess up my pace that badly. Everybody looked at me like I was crazy and kept trying to tell me to run faster and keep up. But I went from dead last to finishing before at least  other people who probably blew up due to their pace for the first mile or so being waaaay too fast for their abilities. This would be my other guess that sounds more likely than you hitting the wall at only  miles. ,running,cy6kz88,3,t5_2qlit

If youre feeling up to it you can run again the next day but bear in mind that it will take about four weeks for your level of red blood cells to get back to a level where youll be able to train at the same peak intensity as before.

The idea in their explanations is to train you how to run on tired legs because that second day you wont be fully recovered and so this mimics how it will feel later in the marathon event. Interestingly it also promotes your bodys ability to recover and if you do this a lot eventually youll get to a point where running that second day is not too bad.So my guess is you could adapt that pretty easy for this event by extending out your doublelong run weekends to longer mileages say by doing their buildup and then adding maybe four extra weeks where you take those backtoback medium length long runs out to longer distances say  miles each day. Thats a lot of time in the saddle by the way so prepare your friends and loved ones for the fact that they wont see you much on weekends.The idea is to promote relatively better recovery adaptations for consecutiveday running which takes a while for your body to adjust for. ,running,cyktp6h,3,t5_2qlit

6203304,0,t3_40jydm,Yes. Truthfully you have to up your calorie intake especially your fat intake and consider resting more until your period returns. Maybe swap out some running days for lower intensity strength training or even yoga. If you cant imagine cutting back on running try decreasing the intensity of your runs significantly. In the meantime youre putting yourself at high risk for stress fracture and osteoporosis down the line.Hypothalamic amenorrhea occurs when a feedback loop from the stress hormones of your adrenal glands overrides your hypothalamus preventing it from manufacturing necessary hormones to stimulate the pituitary and subsequently the ovaries into functioning from a reproductive standpoint.At the end of the day the reason for hypothalamic amenorrhea is that your body is in a very high stress state as a result of all of the exercise youre doing and likely caloric restriction since you have a history of an eating disorder you have to be honest with yourself about whether or not youre truly eating enough to meet your calorie expenditure for the day. The only way to counteract this high stress mode is to exercise less exercise less intensely andor eat more.,running,cyuqzzr,8,t5_2qlit

So for example if you ran  minutes fast then youd want to rest for . minutes and then do your next rep.In terms of duration youd rather do something between  minutes long with a suitable warm up.

Traditional shoes at your local Sports Authority or similar stores usually carry shoes with heal strikers in mind since that is their target sale population.  If you choose this route be aware not to increase mileage too quickly to avoid injury from not adapted muscles. TRAINING Practice strides after runs and and focus on your form eg forefoot lift knees arm drive dont crouch your back One example is   metres or   metres.  Get a friend to video you to see your form and see what you need to improve.  Like others said higher cadence will make it difficult to overstride so you wont be heel striking as much.Practice running drills such as high knees quick feet butt kicks and skipping before runs or after.  These will promote a forefoot landing as well.Aside from drills and strides do stretches to relieve shin splints or runners knee after every run.  One such stretch is walking on your heels for shin splints.  You can google other stretches.  For runners knee the pretzel stretch lean with your arm over stretch and a few others help here ,running,czceb6z,1,t5_2qlit

Trying to get up to a specific heart rate as fast as possible is not a good idea your body needs a warm up. I generally run slow for the first  minutes or so and then sort of speed up to my normal training pace and then my heart will catch up. As you get to be in better shape your heart rate will go down quicker. For me one of the most astonishing things about elite athletes is how fast they can recover from hard efforts.

6514843,0,t3_44ulqn,I live in a city with a LOT of stray dogs. I cant emphasise on how many stray dogs live on the streets of my city. And I regularly run anywhere between  am when nobody is awake the streets are dark in the winter and youll only find dogs and drunkards.The key to dogs is to first avoid and then to ignore them. If I see one up ahead Ill cross the street and run on the other side and the dog usually just stares at me out of curiousity. If the dogs start barking Ill usually just walk and get out of their radius before running again. These dogs often also start running behind me. At first I was scared of it before I realised it was just them being friendly and wanting to go on a little trot. If theyre not barking and are just running then its usually friendly. Ive had dogs run alongside me for more than .kms in the past but its usually just a few hundred metres.My worst experience with dogs while running was actually on a crowded beach during daylight. I accidently made eye contact with a stray dog who started barking at me. I stopped running and was then surrounded by the entire pack of about a dozen dogs who were all barking at me. I just stood there and did  nothing and the dogs got bored after about  seconds and left me alone. The whole beach was staring at me but none of them knew what to do either. Ive realised that dogs everywhere do this but they usually dont mean any harm. I think one of my best runs ever was through a tiny village in Eastern Iran where all the neighbourhood dogs had gathered in a very loose circle with a radius of around  metres around me and were all barking at me. I just ignored them and kept going down the road and treated it more as a welcoming party to the village. They got bored after I left their circle and went about their merry lives of nothingness at the edge of the desert.,running,czt6p52,3,t5_2qlit

6541743,0,t3_458g17,Thanks to whoever posted the Jack Daniels calculator yesterday.This morning while I was doing my  mile recovery run after doing intervals yesterday I had a small light go off in my head.  Its not my tempopace runs that have been slow its the damn easy runs that have been too fast.  Ive read this advice a million times but just never thought it applied to me because I always thought I was slow.  According to JD my easy runs should be around minmile while Ive been clocking them in around minmile.  Im partially blaming my cold and my sever dislike of it but I know this has been an ongoing problems since Ive started taking running seriously.So here is my question  Im doing HH HM training intermidiate which calls for a intervaltemp run midweek and a pace run on Saturday.  Since I enjoy the speed Im going at gtminmileish meaning Im not totally dead after these easy runs maybe a little winded but can easily head to work and bike  miles should I just be fucking booking it on pace runs?

6551387,0,t1_czwx706,Id say I fall under the competitive amateur umbrella I do technically get free stuff as a form of sponsorship but there are plenty of people who race around my level who dont get the free stuff and I dont make any money off of it as a female hoping to get sub. Most girls around my speed are definitely running in the  range for the distance. Ive recently upped it to mpw or rather maintained mpw since a fall  miler for which I ran that volume just because Im trying to consistently maintain higher base mileage so I can also race longer distances at a somewhat high level. An equivalent male runner  is the age graded male equivalent time to an  female k would also normally hover around  mpw. Those times arent yet even at the subelite level subelite is a fairly vaguenebulous term but to quantify it as agegraded at  it would be  for men and  for women both of which require loads more training volume and intensity than what I put out yet still arent elite.Its just weird that the author would define himself as that really.

6572686,0,t3_45o65y,Ive had the same issue  I thought they were shin splints but when I finally talked to a PT it turned out the paindiscomfort was actually coming from the Tibialis Posterior. Basically what he said is that if you have collapsed arches I do because I have slightly knocked knees and youre running without proper support your inner foot repeatedly tugs on that tendon which goes up through your arch ankle shin etc. and causes pain similar to shin splints. I was running in Nike Frees and switched to some Asics with more cushioning and support and it has helped A LOT. What youre dealing with could be the same thing or something similar and you likely just need to adjust how much your foot can pronate.

6698609,0,t1_d0c1wqc,Essentially three things. Cadence. More stepstime  less forcestep. Also shorter str. Technique. Foremidfoot strike  Load spreads over entire surface of your soles and the foot itself can absorb some of the impact forces. Actively lifting feet before strike  decreased impact velocity equal force is absorbed over a slightly longer period of time. Bent knees  force can not travel efficiently through your straight legs and knees into your hips and is instead partially lost in the inefficient energy transmission of a bent leg analogous to how a spring works. No pushing off the ground  less airtime less force to absorb on landing less energy wasted pushing yourself up into the air most easily observed by how much your head and torso move up and down with each step. You want to move forward not up and down.. More better muscle mass. Welldeveloped musculature that is actively engaged in running is better at controlling your footfalls and especially at absorbing repeated impact forces than your skeleton and connective tissues are and it is far superior at repairing itself quickly and repeatedly so it will not wear out like your joints do. It makes your running a much more sustainable activity.Im sure there are many more factors I have not mentioned. Each of these makes only a small difference in how impact force is created absorbed by and distributed inover your body with each step but together they compound over time to make a significant difference on the scale of months and years. Or you could just always run uphill.,running,d0c6zwv,7,t5_2qlit

Ive got a mile this upcoming weekend then thats probably it for the EB for me anytime soon I want them all to be actual race efforts for the given distance its just a good way for me to stay accountable hence why I didnt input my k pace as my  Mile EB. Theres a fairly decent chance that Ill be moving somewhere notparticularlytrainable for a few months so while Ill still run when its safe and participate in a few local races if I find any I wont have solid training behind me. That would put me out of my upcoming marathon but I dont mind. Just yesterday I was saying that I could just run a kinda crappy marathon right before the Boston registration date get the BQ then submit it and actually train for Boston. But then I realized that Id rather not finish my upcoming position while dedicating all of my time there to training poorly in a notsupersafe area bust my ass to get home and train for two months for a crappy marathon especially not when I could instead travel for a few weeks after the job ends all for the sake of Boston . Id rather just run something in NovemberDecember and train normally then do Boston .Not sure why I shared all that irrelevant information haha. Anyway yeah theres a fair chance Ill just be in it for one more upcoming  Mile EB then Ill be out for a while. Thats ok life happens!

6858370,0,t3_49pii6,Just curious why you want to go straight from I hate running to full marathon?Why not ramp it up a little slower and at least enjoy it a little bit before youre spending  hours a week running training for a full marathon. Also figuring out a meal plan is putting the cart before the horse is even born.Assuming you mean the Disney Princess run there is a half marathon too.Most people myself included arent capable of following a year long training plan to a single racegoal. Try incremental goals. Do Couch to k then bridge to k then a half marathon plan. If you still really want to rush straight into a full then move up to that after your half.Not trying to come across mean but I would much prefer if people started a habit of running and actually enjoyed it instead of suffering for  hours to cross a marathon off their bucket list.,running,d0tpe9l,6,t5_2qlit

6868503,0,t3_49qljt,I think any time you switch the transition is going to be rough. I run outside when its nice and inside when its bad weather or too hotcold  over depending on humidity under  depending on wind.So after starting running in about April of last year in July I switched to the treadmill because it was swampy hot and I was inhaling bugs. I thought this transition was the worst thing ever. I was not used to a consistent pace.  My MO with the treadmill is to go slow but go comparatively long. Normally when Im outside I start off fast and slow down as I get over the mile mark. On the treadmill Im slow but aiming to stay at one pace.  Now Im moving back outside after being on a treadmill almost exclusively since the New Year. This time around my problem is that Im going way fast in the beginning  faster than my treadmill pace and getting gassed about mile .The camber in the path and the harder pounding also causes my hip to seize up.  ,running,d0uutfo,1,t5_2qlit

6908171,0,t3_4a8knc,I did what you are thinking of doing and actually found the k to be easier. Yes you do need to train on trails if the k would be on trails. Otherwise theres so much less pressure at a smaller k. No one cares if you stop and eat for a few minutes. Need to stop and use the bathroom for a few minutes? Go ahead no one will notice or care. Depending on the size of the race you might be completely alone for some of it. Theres so much less emphasis on time at a trail run. The pace doesnt matter youre not being told your time at every mile marker which to me is just another small source of constant pressure. You arent tripping over people slower than you for the first few miles people who lined up in the wrong corral. There are no people screaming at you to KEEP GOING YOURE ALMOST THERE! No loud music. No signs with witty sayings that lose their humor by mile . I understand that that kind of stuff motivates some people but not me.I found it to be much calmer. The extra distance wasnt much of a factor. Yes it took more time overall but by the end I was much happier and more relaxed than when I finished the marathon which drained me mentally and physically.In case you cant tell Im not a big fan of marathons.,running,d0zczyu,1,t5_2qlit

Look up hip flexor stretches and work them for  seconds at a time a few times a day.  Frequency is more important than volume.You are probably also taking strides that are too long forcing your flexor to overwork.  Increase your cadence and shorten your stride.

Im not like huffing and puffing or super sore the day after a run if thats what you mean. That being said I am not a natural runner and I am super slow so in terms of time the longer distance runs are a commitment since it takes such a long time. Getting myself out the door and past the first mile or so is usually the hardest part.,running,d1p7v0m,0,t5_2qlit

7138085,0,t3_4dajkc,You are losing the battle with your brain. You need to find something that gets your mind off running. Every runner has this mental battle with that little person in there saying STOP WALK STOPPPPP!!!!! as we push ourselves to the limit. What is the worse thing that can happen when you are in the last mile? If you have issues speed walk it. If you do not push yourself you will never get to the finish line.If you have Netflix watch  and see the mental games those people go through.  Spirit of a Marathon or Desert Runners are also good for the mental aspect. Heck look for a rerun of this years US Marathon Trials and see what battle Shalane Flanagan had at the end of her race. ,running,d1pitt4,1,t5_2qlit

Some people havent taken a day completely off in years and some people take  a week.  There are some general best practices but even those depend on your goals.The first part bad days and good days could be from anything because you slept poorly ate something funny are stressed out from work it was really hot that day it was really cold that day your shoes just dont feel quite right youre still sore from yesterday youre nervous about the race next week etc etc.  Basically dont get too bent out of shape or too overthemoon about a single run.

Also the run Im doing is known as a charity run where a lot of people walk the k route but the more serious people continue to the half or full marathon so I guess the further you run sometimes weeds slower people out?

Do you want to get to running k as soon as possible? To be honest my advice would be to tweak it to make it more similar to CK but you seem to have not liked that program so much and make the walks shorter like others have suggested. I also think your program is quite conservative but if theres no rush it will indeed slowly build you up to running further each time.,running,d1vz0xq,2,t5_2qlit

It felt fine and I though its just soreness but next week I did a k and the last k I felt my knees stiff when trying to bend them. Took a few days off and continued to run but the stiffness returned in a few km and soon I had pain when I tried to bodyweight squat or straighten the knee. Being the idiot that I am I ran on it for a month since I had races and the pain never went away. I am one week of no running today and it feels better and there is no pain when I walk bend straighten etc. I did try all kind of stretches and exercises but nothing worked. Its most likely an overuse injury that kept getting swollen and irritated by my running through it and as long as that is swollen the healing process doesnt work. I do have a k on Sunday though that I planned to PR it but Im just hoping to run it now with no pain whatsoever. If it comes back Ill just take another week completely off.

Despite my rough workouts on Wednesday morning every other run was great and executed according to its purpose. The workout on Friday morning was difficult but it felt great. I had originally planned to do  reps but I was close to an allout effort on  amp  so I shut it down. Theres no need to go over the edge just to get one more rep in. I think I can do that workout faster in the coming weeks but I need a bit more speed under my belt. My long run this morning was probably the best run Ive ever had. I just felt great and I was able to run mi and faster without too much effort. My heart rate stayed super low considering the pace and so I just went with it. I ended up running a filthy last  miles and dipped under mi for the last . This was my highest weekly mileage total ever! Im so stoked.  mpw is no joke. Im feeling really good right now and Im looking forward to steadily increasing my mileage over the next few weeks. Ive got another week at  and then      mpw to finish out May. Its going to be rough but Im confident I can handle it I just need to make sure I get the proper amount of sleep and calories. ,running,d26nl7h,13,t5_2qlit

If you have a good dinner and dont really do shit beforehand as long as the mile isnt more than an hour and a half you should be good with a banana. But just like cmeatmebr suggested its different for everyone just experiment with different things be cognoscente of how you feel eating those foods. Start with a cliff bar and a banana.

7300358,0,t1_d27fy54,You dont necessarily need a GSD to get a dog that is capable of covering  miles a week.  For example a husky can easily cover that distance they are a breed that was designed for running long distances but when they are home they are generally pretty content to just lay around. Any of the sporting group and most of the hounds even the larger terriers would have no problem with runs up to  miles. GSDs and other highlyintelligent breeds also require mental stimulation in order to not get bored and destructive. If you plan on doing serious training that may be fine but if all you are going to do with the dog is running Id go with something else. GSDs also have a high propensity for hip problems so you might one day end up with a high energy dog that cant run. Also keep in mind that unless you adopt an older dog you arent going to be able to just start running right away. Dogs need to be fully grown before they can safely run long distances otherwise you risk doing longterm damage to their joints. For a GSD I believe you wouldnt be cleared by the vet to start running until they are around  months old. If you do want a GSD Id recommend checking with a GSD rescue group to see if they have any adult dogs needing adoption that would be suitable for you. Be sure to let them know that you want a running companion so that they can prescreen for things like hipknee issues.,running,d2801oo,1,t5_2qlit

He is  has been running for at least  years has run a sub  hour marathon and is going to be running a half marathon next weekend. Note he also was a avid backpacker and worked as an instructor so that probably added to the wear on his knees. He has had some trouble with his knees in the past  three meniscus repairs and an ACL repair. He still runs  days a week but regularly cross trains on the bike and does a fair amount of core work. I pushed him to run a half after he got nostalgic when I ran a marathon a few years back and so far so good. His longest run was hrs and he said his knees felt fine he was wearing a patella strap. I think he is really more concerned with the state of his lower back. Also he avoids running on the road and usually sticks to gravel paths or the track.

7406851,0,t3_4grhd2,Dude or dudette! I have just gotten over tight calves working with a physical therapist. Heres what Ive learned Stretch. Hold your stretches for  seconds. Each side. Do it again. An hour later stretch again. Stretch your calves all day long. Every time you see a curb you should be thinking I could go stretch on that right now. Foam roller works great for big areas. But to target those small knots you need smarter tools. A tennis ball works great. You have to break up the knots in your calves that are preventing you from getting a fullmotion stretch. Get a  minute massage and have the MT work on just your calves. Be patient. It sucks I know. But its going to take several days for your calves to loosen up. ,running,d2k3zpo,5,t5_2qlit

7432265,0,t3_4gyhm2,Its funny because I look back at my HS years of running and look at now and see how much better Im doing just handling my own training. At the same time though I cant help but be thankful for the coaches I had. One of my coaches an absolute legend and Im not just saying that he really is a local coaching legend leading multiple teams and athletes to States and even Nationals recommended that I go to Fleet Feet my Freshman year. I was running in regular sneakers and he got me to go out and get running shoes. I dropped a minute off of my mile time in a week just by getting the appropriate footwear. This same coach had us run plenty of interval training and tempo runs and for many athletes it worked. I was a sort of exception. And I know I was a bit of a disappointment to some of my coaches. They had very high hopes for me and I generally did not live up to those hopes but Ive never been highly motivated by others wanting me to succeed and trying to improve me. Now that Im running on my own and internally motivated challenging myself to be better Im actually getting better. And I have that freedom to run when and how I wish. So in many ways my thinking runs parallel to yours although I cant help but be thankful for my coaches. They were fantastic it just wasnt a good fit for me. I wound up taking a few years more or less off because the joy of running just wasnt there anymore. Ive found that joy on my own though and once I run my first marathon next month Im going to call up that one coach and ask for some advice on the side. My goal is to BQ off my own training then if he can help me improve me times even more Ill incorporate his advice into my training. Best of both worlds in a sense.,running,d2n026b,3,t5_2qlit

The bigger one actually sleeps in the living room for most of the night most nights and then comes into the bedroom after the sun comes up. The smaller one just sleeps wherever on the bed. In the summer when its hot they will sleep on the floor. I actually prefer the smaller one sleep on the bed because she has issues with peeing on the floor sometimes and she usually wont jump down on her own.

7680630,0,t1_d3f5qgp,I agree with your observation about endurance. Taking a look at rest and nutrition will likely be important for OP. However Id suggest taking a different approach to training as well  three runs a week at the paces and lengths described might not be enough to facilitate significant improvement. Id suggest upping weekly mileage slowly using the  rule or structuring the workouts so that OP runs at least four times a week. K seems low for someone who wants to see improvement in their halfmarathons psrticularly when the runner in question still finds themselves taking regular walking breaks. ,running,d3f8p5u,2,t5_2qlit

7683482,0,t3_4kjr6z,There is this exercise I found on a blog of a subelite woman.  Ive tried over and over to find it again but having trouble finding it now.  The following exercise is what got me over runners knee.  The gist is basically you sit on a high chair high enough for your legs to dangle and not touch the ground.  Get a resistance band and tuck it under your foot.  Pull up on the resistance band.  Bottom of your foot should be  deg to your leg parallel to the ground.Now repeatedly move your foot left to right while trying NOT to move your knee and upper leg.  The range of motion will be small.  Youll find its tough to angle your foot and lower leg left and right without angling your entire leg above the knee.  Your mileage may vary but hope this helps you or someone else and may be worth a shot if youve tried other strengthening techniques.,running,d3fkcbq,1,t5_2qlit

As ive mentioned I have that base as of last week but was going to drop to  for June so I can enjoy myself and recover a bit then was just going to jump right into the plan.  Not too worried about it ive jumped into high mileage before and its been fine im fairly resilient knock on wood.  Also about the weightless not too concerned.  I was eating at a  deficit through the half training plan and felt no issue with energy.  Also when I trained for my first marathon I dropped around  lbs throughout the duration of that training so traning and losing weight at the same time is not an issue for me. Of course ive never attempted  miles a week so have no idea what kind of calorie consumption id need to have to sustain that.

7753935,0,t3_4lg686,Heres my success story perhaps it can offer some hopeI recently experienced some nasty shin pain after a tempo run . week before my first HM. Rested for  days then tried again but had to stop after less than a mile due to shin pain. The HM was  days away and I didnt have much hope of being able to complete it.So the next day i went to a physiotherapist. She showed me some shin and calf stretches told me to do lots of toe raises and cross train. I also iced the sore area and massaged the tibialis posterior muscle not the tibia bone! several times every day this provided almost instant relief. I also took  mg of Voltaren x a day leading up to the HM. The recommended dosage without a prescription is  x  mg so the safe choice is probably to stick with that. I doubled up because I am a great big beast of a man no Im not.Come race day the pain was gone. Ran the whole thing without any pain yay!So maybe you can postpone your long run a few days stretch and massage the area and then go for it?I also recommend diclofenac voltaren over ibuprofen works much better for me. Its apparently a little unsafe to run with NSAIDS in your system but I did it anyway. Since then Ive used a metronome app to increase my cadance was overstriding a bit even with a mid foot strike and I stretch my shins after every run. My shins are almost completely pain free now and getting better Good luck!,running,d3nkbw6,1,t5_2qlit

7774525,0,t3_4ls135,I cant speak to the chiropractor or the accuracy of your diagnosis but achilles tendonitis tends to take a long time to heal.   weeks in an ideal case where its not too bad and you treat it well during recovery but it can take more than  months and even require surgery in bad cases especially if you keep running on it before youve recovered sufficiently.  This is an  injury you absolutely should not try to run through and a serious enough situation that you really should check with a doctor who is trained to diagnose and treat these sorts of injuries even if its only one visit to get a second opinion about the diagnosis and the treatment youre undergoing.Tendon and ligament injuries unfortunately take a longer time to heal than a comparable amount of muscle or even bone damage.  This is because tendons and ligaments have very little blood flow through them and its the blood that brings in nutrients to supply material for tissue repair as well as carry away damaged tissue that your body tries to get rid of.,running,d3pwfkd,3,t5_2qlit

I was able to run the longest since my injury finishing my morning run outside of . miles at an average pace of  minutes per mile.  It felt great and with my marathon not until November I still have a lot of work left but I feel like I can do it.  Note to self  stretch out hip after every run.TLDR  Had a back injury that took my training which had me up to  miles down to nothing  Recovered and back to running! ,running,d3rwl62,6,t5_2qlit

Subsides within an hour or so to a point that isnt painful but just sorta feels...off. The pain isnt bad maybe  or  out of . Only on the left leg so far. Inside part of the leg where the shin bone meets what I assume is the soleus muscle. More concentrated towards the knee but does hug the shin bone basically down to the ankle if I think about itpress on it.

7890597,0,t1_d42ccbt,Huh? Not at all. I have always heard tempo  lactate threshold  race pace for about  miles. Basically you run  to  miles at  mile race pace to train your mitochondria to enlarge and have more of them to more quickly clear lactate from your blood. This ability is most critical in race distances from k to half marathon. Below k VO max is more important and above halfmarathon muscular endurance is more important. When I searched it on googlegt What is a tempo run?A tempo run is a fasterpaced workout also known as a lactatethreshold LT or threshold run. Tempo pace is often described as comfortably hard. Tempo running improves a crucial physiological variable for running success our metabolic fitness.Granted people make up all kinds of stuff and call it whatever. edit Its important to get this right because IMO tempo run is the best bang for the bullet. Least chance of injury and greatest way to improve and fairly simple to implement. a or  weekly LT runs will give you a lot of improvement. Another good link  You can also break them up with short slower periods. ,running,d42z5n2,1,t5_2qlit

7896990,0,t3_4nfyrs,Experienced runners how do you select a new pair of shoes? Do you just try them out for a bit and select the ones that are more comfortable?Im not an experienced runner but Ive worn out my first pair of running shoes mesh has holes! I ran km in them and now I need new ones. For my first pair of shoes I went to a specialized store where they did a video recording of how I ran. They decided I didnt have pronation issues and gave me various shoes to try. Eventually I ended up with the only pair of shoes that didnt slip off my feet during running asics gt  . Later I read up on shoes and learned about all the various options. But it all comes down to a proper gait analysis and I feel that the people in running stores dont know a thing about how to do that. Im not an expert but I know Im not an expert and would never do a gait analysis on anyone. If you cant properly see how I overpronate and how my ankle sort of collapses on the end of the gait cycle Im not really inclined to believe anything you say. And theres more to a gait analysis than just looking at pronationsupination. Half a year ago I just accepted the pair of shoes and was quite happy with them! as I didnt feel comfortable critizising his opinion but now Im wondering whether it actually matters at all  and how I should approach getting new shoes. I know of that study where they had soldiers pick their own shoes vs detailed analysis and that picking them yourself was associated with less injuries  but thats just one study...

7942938,0,t3_4o0vju,I will start marathon training in about  weeks. The goal marathon is the NYC marathon. The last time I properly trained for a marathon was  also for NYC  which was for my first marathon. I did all the short and long runs by my house on asphalt usually looping the same places. This year to avoid the heat people overheating and nasty sunburns I am planning to do most long runs on trail. The trail itself is not difficult it consists of rolling hills. A  mile run gets about  ft of elevation gain. I also run slower on trail. Do you think this would be a good idea or should I stick to running in an environment closer to the marathons environment? Would I benefit for running on hilly places when the marathon itself is not so hilly? ,running,d48uzci,2,t5_2qlit

My A races have come and gone the Colfax half and BB. Perhaps the RNR Denver Half in Oct.What kind of training plan are you following? I have had enough of excessively complicated training plans from my time road bike racing. I run  mpw and throw in various workouts ex hill repeats speed work tempo etc when I feel like it. One of these days I will plan better...or not.Are you a member of a running club? No I was in a bike racing club for  years. Rarely encountered anyone or had time for club functions due to work three kids. No point.Also tell us something about yourself. I was obese in  and took up cycling. Eventually lost a pile of weight and started racing. Burned out last year due to the excessive time commitment and costs related to said sport. Took up running again and slowly worked my way up to a half. Incidentally I took my dog on a run last winter and that was rad.

But I have a bit of an addictive personality so I find that I spend a lot of my waking hours thinkingreadingtalking about running.  I think my hubby is probably getting annoyed.  Also because of my personality I really struggle with trying to best myself.  Im significantly slower running than I used to be and that drives me crazy.  So while I want to start training for a HM I have a hard time focusing on distance and instead I spend a lot of time running  miles but trying to do them at a better pace than I could the week before.  Im afraid Im pushing myself too fast too soon and I dont want to wind up dealing with an injury.  But damn if I dont just enjoy running!  It is such good therapy for me and I love being able to leave my hubby home with the kids and just run.  Push my body to do something hard but to do it anyway.  And I really really want to run a half marathon with my dad this year.  I found one that is in the middle of November so I feel like thats plenty of time for training.

8102056,0,t3_4q4hah,I will unfortunately be joining you only in the virtual race but Ive run the Falmouth Road Race quite a few times. You basically have the idea of the race down. The start can be a bit tight but the waves they have done in recent years seem to reduce congestion. Still your first mile might be slower than expected. There is a big hill right at the end of the first mile that leads you into the shade and rolling hills. Around mile three you open onto the flat and sunny area along the ocean that can be windy. Usually in the summer the wind will be at your back though. This section gets really hot though so make sure to drink enough water. It stays essentially flat until about  and a half miles when there is a final long hill. Mentally this hill is really challenging and feels like it goes on forever. I would suggest maybe ending runs on uphills and checking out this part of the course before you run it if you have the opportunity. Other than that its a great race and good luck!Edit if you have any other or more specific questions I can try to answer them!,running,d4qqstl,2,t5_2qlit

For example the clam shell exercise have your heals touching the first week in later weeks to make it harder keep an inch or two of air between your feet by holding your upper leg up.I am guessing resistance bands would be better.Remember the goal is to  get these muscles firing to do their normal job of stabilizing the leg during normal daily activity and running too  strengthen them since they have atrophied. ,running,d4tymsg,1,t5_2qlit

However our society still treats male and female athletes very differently. Boys are still expected to toughen up work through it be their best at an early age etc. and girls are told to take it easy have hobbies other than their sport etc.I think this early paternalism is one reason we still have separate gendered sports leagues and that we still have an assumption that the best men will always outperform the best women.My comment wasnt to poke fun of legit sports medicine but to poke fun at the easy daddys little girl protective reaction. ,running,d4vui16,3,t5_2qlit

8158453,0,t3_4qygg5,Youre sore the morning after a k. Do you mean a race? Or just running k?If youre sore after a race thats really not uncommon. You push yourself harder in a race so youre working your muscles harder. The best way to counteract that is to slow jog a mile or two after the race. That flushes all the byproducts out of your legs. It makes a huge difference even if you only run  minute mile pace for the cooldown. Im always much less sore and less stiff the next day.If youre that sore after a regular run of k then you should probably make sure youre stretching immediately after the run. If you run and immediately sit down and dont move the rest of the day youre gonna stiffen up something terrible. It might also be that your muscles just arent prepared for that kind of running. In that case Id recommend slowing down or running less and building up your distance slowly.,running,d4xcs94,2,t5_2qlit

Fish fat contains omega which improves fat burning capacity and lowers the carbohydrates consumption. We only have  grams of carbs stored in the body while the fat storage has no limit.

The fenix version seems great but the HR model is really pricy. The vivo seems a little cheaper but not sure about its looks and function vs the Garmin.

8318973,0,t1_d5he0ke,I respectfully disagree with one part of this answer. If the knee pain is significant enough to get in the way of your training you should NOT run the actual marathon. If your knee is in unbearable pain after  miles during your training run and this has been an increasingly problematic and it still hurts  hours later you DO NOT want to attempt a run twice that long. Not to mention Im not sure the date of the marathon. Obviously you dont want to go months without running and then run a marathon.If the race is months away at the earliest October take a couple of weeks off and see how you feel.

Your hips are likely hurting from the jump in impact volume more than anything.  To work on your form try doing a warmup before your run that includes high knees butt kickers skips lunges gate openers bounds and strides. Really focus on the mindbody connection when you do them. Not only are these a good way to teach your body good form if you do them correctly but they are also good as a dynamic warmup.,running,d5llauu,6,t5_2qlit

8368531,0,t3_4twihi,Based solely off the experience Ive had with my girlfriends eating disorder and her previous workouts I would recommend not running at all. Seriously. If you were at an inpatient facility that means your BMI was obscenely low likely due to compulsive running and hour long workouts daily in an effort to burn calories and lose weight as fast as possible. Im also guessing that you left inpatient and went right back to the way you lived the same ways that got you there in the first place as is the tendency with a lot of ED patients. I know that ED patients who have a history with running form an unhealthy relationship with it and the mental bond is so great that existentially they can become lost as to who they are as an individual and if you go back to it immediately recovery wont be realistic anytime soon. If Im way off on my assessment ya know my bad and Im sorry for reading into the situation incorrectly. But Ive seen too much struggle in regards to ED and exercise to not at LEAST recommend that you stop running altogether take time to focus on yourself learn to love yourself and learn to nourish yourself so you can live the life you want in the future.

8403458,0,t1_d5repsm,gt What I mean is that will it take my feet a lot of time getting used to minimal shoes like the Free Rn?Oh OK I get it. YMMV it depends mainly on what kind of footwear youre used to how strong your feet are and whether you already have an OK gait for that. Some people put on shoes like these and run in them just fine from the getgo others need a few weeks or months to get used to them and for yet others they just dont work at all.gt but it provides medial support which could make my supination even worse.Dont worry about that too much. Much of the whole pronation  supination stuff is scientifically questionable anyway  there doesnt seem to be any evidence linking pronationsupination shoe features and injury rates the only somewhat significant finding appears to be that shoes on the extreme end of motion control seem to be correlate with an increased injury rate and that transitioning into minimalist shoes causes an increase in certain injuries during the first few weeks to months. In short if it feels great it probably is.So if youre asking whether you should get minimalist neutral or stronglyfeatured shoes or how much cushioning you should have nobody can answer that youll have to find something that works for you.,running,d5rz84h,1,t5_2qlit

8417338,0,t1_d5syvgn,I think that there are three key piecesFirst make sure that they pace themselves. In my experience the hardest races and felt like quitting have been when I have gone out too fast and started using my anaerobic system too much. I use heart rate as a measure so my advice is to make sure they know what heart rate is medium exertion and stick to it. Its going to go up and as it does it gets harder and harder to keep going. If they dont have a heart rate use RPE. They should be able to have an easy conversation to start.Second I like what Pfitzinger said if you quit itll be easier to quit the next time. So unless theyre injured quitting only makes it easier to quit the next time.Finally I always tell myself once I start a race Its not a question of if its a question of when. Even when I injured myself during the race it only happened once I knew that I would finish it was only a question of how fast and once I was able to come to terms with the fact that any speed is good enough it kept me going.Best of luck!,running,d5tpl5h,2,t5_2qlit

8443019,0,t3_4v7vot,I dont think either is more efficient assuming the rest of your form is correct. I think its just how your feet connect to your body. For example Im a forefoot striker while my boyfriend heel strikes. If we lie next to each other with relaxed legs my toes are pointing down toward the bed in a strongly plantar flexed position whereas his are pointing at the ceiling. I can flex my foot up while running to force a midfoot strike and he can force plantar flexion to be up on his toes but neither feels natural.Taking shorter strides generally a good thing so your foot lands under rather than in front of you is likely to move a lot of people toward a mid or forefoot strike because you would need very flexed ankles or very high drop shoes to land with a bent knee and your foot under you and your heel on the ground although some elite runners still heel strike with this good running form.,running,d5wwzo0,2,t5_2qlit

8471055,0,t1_d609f2y,If youre worried that you have one of these and dont know which it is its best to see a doctor. AFAIK a stress fracture if left untreated is on its way to eventually becoming a stress fracture. Stress fractures require time completely off of running and can eventually require surgery if left untreated while you continue running.  Shin splints often dont require time off of running or only require  extra days rest. Shin splints are often in both legs while stress fractures are often only in one leg. Shin splints are often felt along the length of the shin and they often dont hurt except during running and right after. Stress fractures are often in a more concentrated area not the entire length of shin and it hurtsfeels tender when pressure is applied. Some jump on one leg a few times and if it hurts think that a stress fracture is likely. Shin splints are more common for those new or returning to running. IIRC soleus problems can also feel like shin problems. ,running,d60f7hk,1,t5_2qlit

8541822,0,t3_4wqd9n,Training runs all serve different purposes. Basically youre getting your body used to running for a long TIME. Long runs are used to train your body to burn fuel efficiently and to get your legs used to being used for a long time. These two factors are already very stressful on your body. By reducing your pace your body will be able to adapt much easier since it doesnt have that extra stress of running fast. During training this is helps to prevent injury.If youre looking for a little confidence booster do a simulated Race one week. Lower the intensity of all your weekly runs and do an  miler at race pace. You should feel like it was difficult but that if necessary you could empty the tank and finish your race distance.Edit As long as you can run your race pace comfortably in training youll be able to run it during your race. Will probably be able to go faster with the added adrenaline. ,running,d69aoxw,8,t5_2qlit

8583032,0,t1_d6ef5na,The Hal Higdon Intermediate programme has two rest days one of which follows the long run. I think thats fair no? Ive always seen the initial few minutes as the key theyre the difficulty you need to surpass if you are to have a good run. Ideally for me you start off and youre pushing yourself forcing the body to react and to adjust. Its not a fast pace but its enough to let the body know that its time to run. At first my legs are a bit sore but it passes as I start warming up and my breath gets heavier  until the body settles into the pace which it can endure. Once settled I can go faster or on for longer because the body has overcome the initial struggle.If I start off too fast I never break my breaths struggle because Im simply asking my body too much. But at the same time if I start off too slowly Im not presenting my body the challenge it needs to start working harder  every pace incremental will be a pain.Thats how I see it. Start off at a decent pace and push your body to adjust. Edit Forgot to say the reason Im saying this I dont think you should be able to talk in the first few minutes. If you are youre not asking enough of your body and itll hurt you in the long run.

Part of it is the sense of accomplishment whether short term yay I killed that hill or long term look how much I did this weekmonthyear. Part is just getting out to experience the environment I dont run on treadmills.But I definitely wouldnt do it if I didnt like it. Might as well do the things you do enjoy. Theres nothing that says everyone has to be into running.On the other hand if you want to like running for some reason then try a slowing down most of your running should be at a comfortable pace especially at the start and if you go too fast all the time youll be in pain all the time and might get injured too and b keeping at it for while... Like a lot of things you get better the more you do it and it becomes more enjoyable when you get a little better. And c perhaps try a CK program.

8702486,0,t3_4z6yli,Ive had problems like this for quite some time before I found a remedy that worked for me. I was told the same thing as udocbad said about hamstrings. Its fairly common to hear that recommendation so I would definitely start there. Unfortunately it didnt really do much for me. In the end I think there were two main problems in my case  improper form and  weak lower back muscles. I always ran too upright with my torso effectively perpendicular to the ground. This can cause extra strain on your lower back see article and links therein  Additionally I began doing exercises focusing on my lower back to strengthen it. Mostly back extensions sometimes called hyperextensions I think seated cable rows and deadlifts.

8733361,0,t3_4znt0n,Not so much a heavier runner although definitely carrying a bit of excess weight right now but i thought i would add a few pointers.First form disclaimer im certainly no coach or expert. This is likely a big part of the problem. When i moved from to more barefoot style it definitely help ease the pains in the joints especially the knees. However your description of forefoot heavy worrys me. You definitely shouldnt be running on your toes ideally you should land with your feet fairly flat albeit with the ball touching down slightly before the rest of your feet. Maybe look into getting some coaching or at least a gait analysis done.I would suggest moving to running shorter and easier more often. instead of  runs totaling  miles say do  or  runs totaling about  miles. This will be a bit easier on your knees in my experience. Once you have a base ramp up the mileage and intensity one at a time.Yes do cross training every runner should hell everyone doing any sport or exercise should cross train however it sounds a no brainier for you right now. Biking is definitely going to be good. Walkinghiking can also be great cross training for trail running to help build up the mileage with lower impact.,running,d6xbeci,2,t5_2qlit

8737566,0,t3_4zo8mw,tldr Last spring my training for my first marathon was interrupted before the final peak. Ran randomly around kweek for the past few months with occasional  km long runs. Can I expect to be able to finish the marathon in  weeks?Starting from last November I was training for my first marathon which would be in late April. Closer to the end I was running  km a week with long runs up to  km  hours. However a flu before the peak of the training ruined my plans as it took around  weeks for the flu to disappear. I didnt want to risk running the marathon without having been able to finish my training plan so I canceled.For all the nearby marathons in the summer I had other things planned on the same date so I didnt set a new target. Then work and life and lack of motivation as I didnt have a goal reduced my weekly distance to around  km with a couple of  km long runs every now and then. In the summer I also had two busy weeks with exactly  running and another two weeks off because of pain in foot one week for the pain another for being sure its gone.Now my life is back to normal so I started running more again. I did a  km long run last weekend which felt perhaps better than ever which got me thinking The last marathon this year that I could attend is in  weeks is it reasonable to expect I can go there and finish the marathon if I spend the following weeks wisely? Starting from last weekend that would mean  weeks of training   weeks of taper. My target time would be around  for comparison my k race time is around  minutes and a I ran the half marathon distance in around  hours in somewhat bad weather last winter. Edit for clarity I dont want to risk injury well more than the risks in running anyway but as this would be my last chance in a few months and I dont know what happens then I guess Im willing to risk DNFing the marathon.,running,d6xuf7i,1,t5_2qlit

8785934,0,t3_50gtnf,New to running and am currently training for a half at the end of October. The idea being that this will give me a decent indicator of what sort of time I should train towards for my first marathon in March  I dont want to be over ambitious but still want to push myself. My couple of questions My plan has me running four times a week. I have hockey field hockey season starting next week with training on Wednesdays and matches on saturdays. Ive adjusted my plan to not have runs on those days. However that is going to leave me with one rest dayweek. Is this sufficient rest or would it be a decent idea to substitute the easier not long runs for the match? Essentially leaving me with  running days a hockey training day and a match. Second and much more basic question I have guideline paces for my runs. My marathon has a few inclines in it and I intend on doing some hills. Should I aim to tackle the hills at target pace or accept Ill go up slower down quicker and aim for an overall average pace for the run?Thanks in advance. ,running,d73wxyb,2,t5_2qlit

The effect is that the insulin will determine the kidneys to expel lots of minerals. This comes together with switching to fat and protein as main energy suppliers.

By February I had a  which I never ended up beating because of teenage laziness and messed up priorities. In the beginning you will feel like youre not getting anywhere but time passes and suddenly the person who couldnt finish a mile wont even feel like you. At this age becoming fit wont take long and it will take relatively little effort compared to someone  or  years older. The biggest thing you have to battle is your brain telling you this is dumb why are you still doing this go play video games what are your friends doing. But then after a few months youll kind of get addicted to it. Most days after practice I would still feel the need to run more. You will get there.

8920344,0,t1_d7k18kv,Looking at the order of operations guide I would say start yourself by testing to see if you are at the threshold to move from Level  to Level . So that would be making sure you consistently run  miles  to  times per week for about four weeks. After that you would start increasing the number of days you run from  times per week to . Spend about a month or so doing that then that threshold test again before moving to the next week.That should increase your mileage pretty gently while bring more consistency to your training.,running,d7k3fay,1,t5_2qlit

Always been fit and running so I thought I could eat anything since I am sure to burn it with running.Instead the my diet is somewhat like thisMondayThursdayVegeterian lunch along with light dinner. Never meat but sometimes chicken and fish. I should eat more fish though. Snacks is always fruits like bananas apples oranges that sort of thing. I drink loads of coffee though as I have always done. Breakfast before work is sometimes crispbread no idea what the right name is it is scandinavian ryewheat crackers that you can find in Publix and Whole Foods. If not that then hard rye bread or bread that is  oats or something like that. They are usually marked good for your heart or something like that. Whole Foods carries a nice variety. Really light amount though and I usually just eat it with some onions and avocado. Fridays I usually maintain healthy choices until dinner when I allow myself a home cooked meal which is usually home cooked hamburger or pizza. On Saturdays I allow myself to eat somewhat unhealthier with maybe a nice brunch containing waffles and all things that are good. Easy on the eggs though since egg reds are cholesterol bombs. Meat on Saturday nights always home cooked usually something low fat and high on protein. Quite often lamb or beef depending on the cut all game meat is also awesome. Craft beer or wine on the weekends is ok. I cant live without my IPA fix..There are loads of things that you should stay away from you can google them. Schrimps are almost poisonous for people with high LDL. Butter is killer and so is a lot of dairy. Also some things are marketed quite strange. Loads of things dont contain cholesterol although your liver will turn it into bad cholesterol. In short rule of thumb is just common sense stay away from sweets sodas snacks and fast food. Cook more. Eat meat but less of it. Eat loads of vegetables. Stay hydrated with water.Hardest thing for me is the sweets I love chocolate!!,running,d7p1ktw,2,t5_2qlit

I think because I did marathon and half marathon trainingraces long before I tried to actually run km or km fast its left me less intelligent on the art of those shorter distances.

8962983,0,t3_531yff, I dont run in midtown but I work here  I see runners every so often and the only thing that I can imagine is difficult is running with the sheer number of people on the sidewalk. Not only do you have everyone who is working in the area but its a prime spot for tourists th avenue shopping Rockefeller Center Grand Central Times Square are all in the area give or take a few avenues. Its possible but its probably annoying AF unless youre planning to run very early in the morning. I would also advise against running in the street as its one of the busiest areas of Manhattan and youll be dodging cars cyclists delivery guys etc.  You dont need to care about wearing running gear. Youll see people in a lot of different outfits and styles of clothingliterally no one will even take a second glance at someone wearing work out clothes. My suggestion would be wear your clothes out of the hotel have a nice brisk walk to Central Park and begin your run once you get there. Maybe someone who does run in this area can chime in but I walk from Bryant Park to Central Park a few times a week and running that route seems like a nightmare. ,running,d7p7rvd,26,t5_2qlit

9002375,0,t3_53k78a,gt He said that I should be running under bpm since that way I will be burning mostly fat and not muscles and its easier on the heart in the long termAs everyone else has said thats way too low.  gt Running coach advised me to run with bpm max to optimise weight loss and to improve heart health in the long run.Whats hes talking about here is running aerobically.  Which basically means that you are running slowly enough for your body to use fats rather than sugars as its main fuel source.  Fats are less efficient but more plentiful.  Running slowly improves your ability to use fats as a fuel source which helps with endurance.  Its why the mantra Do most of your runs slowly is actually good advice.  Please note this has nothing to do with weight loss.  Ill get to that laterNow for most people aerobic running sits at a higher heart rate than .  But theres a easier method of determining whether youre running aerobically or not.  The talk test.  If you can talk in one or two complete sentences whilst you run youre probably running aerobically.  When youve found that pace and sustained it for a while have a look at your heart rate and note it for future reference.  Thats your aerobic HR though of course it will vary up and down from that quite a bitNow on the weight loss front a calorie is a calorie.  It doesnt matter whether you burn it from fat stores or carb stores in your body it all works out the same in the end.  Your body will top up your carbsugar stores and then any excess calories will go to fat stores.  The way to lose weight is to eat less calories than you need over an extended period which will force your body to constantly dip in to your fat stores.  And how do you maximise calorie burn from running?  By running longer.  And thats where slow running comes in.  There is no magical fat loss zone.  Its simply that the slower you run the longer you can run and the more calories you will burn overall.  ,running,d7ty27j,17,t5_2qlit

Some of the best workouts to improvie half marathon time are long intervals at subk pace think m or extended tempo runs at subhalf marathon pace think  miles. Judging from your post it sounds like most of your runs may have been at relatively easy paces. Do you usually run  minute miles or slower? It is important that you spend some time running faster than this and at least get in some  mi. runs at your goal half marathon pace.That being said if you just ran a half marathon in  hours the odds of running another marathon with such a short break in  are very slim unless something went seriously wrong on race day nutritionwise or something else unusual.,running,d7wcey0,1,t5_2qlit

At  mpw you have a great base for adding in some faster stuff but maybe start with one day at first add a second after a few weeks if that goes well. Fast finish on the long run is OK if you feel like it but I wouldnt worry at all about just running that all easy for now too.Are you looking to a particular race distance as a goal or are you just adding faster work to break up monotony a bit? I do two workoutsweek when training for shorter stuff a tempoprogression day and a trackinterval day plus a long run and for longer races I generally do one workout mostly temporace pace work with longer intervals occasionally some shorterfaster toward the end of a cycle to sharpen a bit a mediumlong run midweek and a long run on the weekend.Bodyweight stuff I would imagine could go on any day you wanted to do it. I lift heavy so I schedule my week so that I run a workout tempo intervals whatever I have planned for that week early AM lift late AM or afternoonevening and the next day is just easyrecovery miles. ,running,d803iq3,7,t5_2qlit

Youd have to investigate and realize that this is all a schtick to get you into the strava ecosystem.  Strava will let you slice and dice your workout data a bunch of different ways if youre into that.  Theyre hoping you will. Sadly for me whilst I was able to export the data from a run via email I was unable to import it into Strava as the format Jabra uses isnt compatible with any of those that can be imported into Strava. I contacted Jabra support about this and they responded very promptly to sadly inform me that at present they have no plans for a desktop version of their app. It would be great if a future update to the app would allow export in the .gpx format as the idea of having the coaching in my ear would be good.

9143967,0,t3_55jgin,You are likely going too fast. Much of training should consist of conversational pace easy runs. Even elites run can run four days a week at a pace they can complete full sentences. This is probably the biggest misconception about running training the is. Dont underestimate the value of easy running. As a beginner all your runs for the first couple weeks should be at a conversational pace. Very gradually increase your mileage. Once you get up to decent sustainable mileage then you can start doing one or two hard days per week.,running,d8b2a9v,1,t5_2qlit

9198609,0,t1_d8hv3vi,It is based on time which works for some people and not for others. Personally not for me. It appears to overemphasize the long run making it more than half of your totally weekly running time in some weeks. It has you run  days a week two shorter easy runs one long run and one or two speed work days. The problems I see are the two shorter easy runs are typically only  minutes which is way way too short and are more like recovery runs and for marathon training it is a bit overkill to have two days devoted to speed work. It reminds me a lot of the FIRST program where they emphasize quality over quantity yet the times dont really work out for anything other than get you to the finish line. There is a severe lack of base building.,running,d8hzp92,2,t5_2qlit

The Higdon plan you linked just looks like a bunch of easy weekday miles with the long run getting increasingly longer.  Reputation wise Higdon plans are known for getting you to the race capable of finishing it.  Pfitz plans have a reputation for pushing you all the way through and letting you run the race.To make the switch the week of December th is  weeks out from your goal race.

9591147,0,t1_d9v9e1j,Cramps in your side side stitches are often from dehydration. If thats even a possibility fix that immediately. Runs are extremely difficult in terms of fatigue when dehydrated too. Remember that you cant hydrate quickly because chugging water will just lead to urination. Cells need time to take up fluid so a bunch at once will just go out to waste. So drink regularly throughout the day every day. A glass of water every hour or two or sip all day with a few full glasses all at once x a day. Start your day with a full glass of water as soon as you wake up. You loose water the entire time you are asleep through respiration. Heavy breathing could be partly from dehydration too plus you might be starting out faster than you should or alternating speed too much. Perhaps you feel behind and then try to catch up? Try very hard to go at a slow and steady pace. Dont pay attention to where other runners are. And from the very beginning take deep regular breaths and try to control your breathing. Some people actually take pretty shallow breaths when starting out. Once you get in an oxygen deficit its hard to recover without walking. Not sure about the lungs. Maybe they are sensitive to cold? Hopefully you just need to get hydrated and run a steady pace. You should be able to take regular even deep breaths even talk while running if your pace is right for you. Try hydrating and working on your pace and see how it goes. A lot of people think they are hydrated but they arent. Thirst is not a strong signal in the early stages of dehydration. I hope this helps. Post back and let us know  how its going! ,running,d9vazxr,1,t5_2qlit

9641342,0,t1_da1d9h2,In general strength training as an adjunct to running or other endurance training is most useful for injury prevention. This will be focused on building general core and leg strength not bulk. When the muscles are strong enough to take on more of the load you reduce strain on joints. Running will do a lot to get you to this point but supplemental strength exercises can help on top of that. Additionally stronger muscles will less susceptible to overusestrain when fatigued such as at the end of a long runrace. Finally strength training and in particular isolating each muscle group can also help avoid imbalances that will lead to injury. Everyone has slight imbalances between left and right sides isolating each side in a simple bodyweight strength routine a couple times a week can help protect against one side getting weaker and weaker due to the other side compensating for it more and more and getting comparatively stronger in a feedback loop.I know all of this all too well  the majority of my running injuries have been fixed by simple exercises to improve overall leg and core strength. Probably could have been preventable if Id been better at keeping up with the exercises.,running,da1hsij,2,t5_2qlit

Prior to the past  weeks I havent run since HS Track ran m amp m.  Ive adjusted some things over the past  weeks. Changing my breathing stopped my side stitch.  Well fitting shoes asics kayanos resolved issues I had with my shins and knees.  Adjusting my stride and landing to a midsole strike has got rid of any remaining knee soreness and almost eliminated hip discomfort.Im now running  minutes per training session x per week at a  pace.

Ive only got just shy of  weeks before my k so I dont want to make any significant changes to my form or training routine right now.

9698570,0,t3_5dy9ra,I ran it this year. Have run this race half marathon in the past.TLDR Bad course but the race had some positives.My thoughtsNegatives. The course  hillsWhy would you make the course so hilly? Those hills were brutal! The elevation chart was so misleading. Why make the race this much challenging? So many people were walking on the uphills. Many hand cyclewheel chair athletes were struggling so hard on the uphills  it just felt so unnecessary.. The course  locationsVery little Center City. I do not like the part that most f the race was in the scenic Fairmount Park. A road where there is absolutely no one besides just runners  why!. The course  spectatorsWith the course being in Fairmount Park for the most how do you expect any crowds to show up there for cheering? If the road is blocked for traffic and it is in the middle of nowhere how will anyone be able to reach the points at say Mile  marker etc.? In other words why would some spectator want to walk  miles since that is where the nearest open street is just to cheer?Some people did actually bike on the sidewalks and showed up to cheer in Fairmount Park and thank you to all those people! There were many cheering near the Art Museum area and thanks to them and all other spectators and of course the volunteers.. The course  water stationsYou keep a water station before the crazy uphills? At Mile . Why not after the uphill when people need it the most... Also I thought they could have had more water stations evenly spread out. There were times when I was looking for a water station but there were none for a significant distance.Positives. TransportationThey had free shuttle buses from the hotel area to the start line and from the finish to the hotels. Although I did not stay at a hotel I was near one of the pickup points and having a shuttle bus was one less thing to worry about. The shuttles were well managed and were convenient. The shuttles was a new feature this year and I definitely liked it.. PortapottiesThere were plenty at the start and although I used them multiple times I never had to wait for too long. Convenient.. Postrace refreshmentsThe postrace refreshments were good and we had a good variety to choose from  bananas pretzels nuts apple juice chopped fruit chicken broth etc.. Expo  bib pickupI had no wait lines when I went to pick up my race bib. Very convenient. The Expo also had runningrelated booths that were helpful grabbed a pair of cheap disposable gloves for  that I ended up discarding at Mile  or so  it felt so warm.Thoughts. Why would they make the course so challenging? All my negatives can be fixed by a less hilly course. Had they advertised the course as hilly that would have been ok but the elevation chart was misleading.. The weather was perfect I would have preferred it slightly cooler in the latter half but not complaining at all. When the weather in late November can be this unpredictable we definitely got good weather better than what the full marathoners apparently had.. IV Hydration. Is this a thing? I saw people at the Expo getting intravenous hydration seemed like saline being injected. The cost was  for one session. So instead of drinking water and eating salts people pay for this... Never seen that before  so was surprised. Anyone tried it?. It wasnt a chilly day. Yes it was cold at start but not freezing. I was still amazed at how many people were wearing jackets running tights gloves etc. even in the latter half of the race. I understand everyone is different but just felt a bit excessive.. Nothing new on race day. I saw a large number of people wearing the race tshirt from this year and I was surprised so many people still do that.. I understand they want to focus on the full marathon but in that case just get rid of the Half option. If you want to be like NYC Chicago Boston follow their track and do not have a Half Marathon option along with the Full. Plus it still seems like the Philadelphia Full is far from being anywhere as close to NYC Chicago Boston etc. The split days just ruined the whole experience for me. Having run this race before I was displeased with the race this year.. I did hit my Half Marathon PR I am slow so my time was  but that is besides the point  I could probably have performed better if the race was less hilly I dont expect it to be flat but not this bad.End rant.edit formatting,running,da8k02n,2,t5_2qlit

While the tread isnt as good as real metal xc spikes it was excellent and suited my needs perfectly. most concerning for me with new shoes is the toe box and while this one isnt quite as wide I prefer the upper is soft enough to accommodate both my wide feet and wool socks. I also picked up both C and Hind thin gloves as well as a new beanie TJ Maxx had some deals.

Some days are better and easier than others just like my regular job. Im doing   miles this week right now my motivation is to always do slightly more miles then the week before by only a mile or two but it gives me the motivation to be better then I was the week before.

9763399,0,t3_5ezou6,Theres a huge difference between motivation and discipline. I am motivated to run in general because I like what it does for me physically and emotionally and because I set goals for myself whether its a fun Disney race or a a target time. But that does shit for me at pm when Im tired from work and its dark out because I live in the frozen north out and its cold out because I live in the frozen north and its icy out because I live in the frozen north and my bed is  inches of memory foam and super comfortable and its the weekend.What gets me out the door is discipline not motivation. And discipline is built brick by brick over years until going for my runs is a habit of thought and of action. Theres still mental inertia to overcome before I roll out of bedaway from reddit but Ive built up a greater inertia of getting on the road for my runs and that makes it a lot easier to decide to run.There are very occasionally mornings on the weekend when I am tired and sore and miserable from a shitty week at work. On those mornings memories of running at Disney and the promise that Im nearly to the end of my training for the Dopey challenge is enough to counteract the imagined misery. Or once thats over the thought of beating my first marathon time by an hour. Or once thats over the next goal.Motivation is a dollop of whipped cream on the banana cream pie of discipline. It does almost nothing on its own but really shines up the pie when its added.Now if youll excuse me I have to go for a run and then bake some pie shells.

Once you can just take a slower pace for a month. Avoid sprints and running hard uphill. Always get warmed up and this is probably the best prevention you can take.

I went from  mpw to finishing the  miler with  feet of elevation gain in  months so I think its pretty doable. I finished comfortably in . hours. Once I signed up I just started running as much as possible as easy as possible. Looking back at my training logs I was able to jump up to  miles of easy running the first week with a long run of  miles and increased the long run every couple weeks until I was up to  miles on trails.

9934154,0,t3_5hpg2s,I say this with no ill intent towards anyone elses goals or achievements but more based on my own feelings about myself.It has always been anything slower than my pr is slow and anything faster is fast simply because I always look at the guys ahead as my motivation my desire is to beat those guys. I could give the PC answer and say sub     but the truth is that it is completely based on me at my best. Even now when my times are minutes slower than my prs and a lot of people say wow youre really fast after races. In my head I feel slow because I constantly compare myself to the days when I was a lot faster. Its all relative to your own ability because once you run a time once the mystique of that times wanes because you know its possible and things youve done are never as exciting or amazing as stuff youve yet to do.   We base other peoples competency on our own ability which makes it very difficult to go wow that is fast when a runner finishes  minutes behind us in a race I can appreciate a good performance from any runner of any ability and be happy for them but I only precieve the runners ahead as fast.This may come across as elitist but it is not really you cant impress everyone so its not important to fit into others definition of what fast is work to become your own definition chase the ever elusive magic dragon.,running,db2g214,3,t5_2qlit

Took a few days off and then did a fast paced short run. Was able to do  minute splits for an hour. I was amazed at the improvement. Of course it can be really hard to find the time to do lots of long runs but in general long runs are the key to improving short distance times. ,running,dbbm8q7,5,t5_2qlit

It tracks your pace to know what your baseline is and the faster you run the more damage you do. I imagine it sort of like Fartlek training where you encounter small monsters that you beat by picking up the pace. And you regain HP by going back to your restingrecovery pace. As you run youll randomly find items and theyll go into your inventory. That would be fun. But let me know what persistence hunting is sounds interesting. ,running,dbonn3h,4,t5_2qlit

Go hop in the pool with an aqua belt around your waist. Spend  minutes  times before you eventthat should work. You can either run up and down the length of the pool or be tethered to the pool deck.

10173072,0,t1_dbwxfwf,Ive been running for maybe  years.  I had plateaued maybe  years ago and was fine with it.  I run very much just for mental and physical health.  However since I was putting so much time into it I got a little more curious and focused on proper training.I also discovered Maffetone around June and gave it a whirl.  My experience was that intentionally staying at the lower heart rate enabled me to recover faster and over the summer I dramatically increased my weekly distance from  km per week to  km per week.Over the summer and into the fall I was disappointed that I wasnt really getting any faster but I was very happy with my increased durability and volume.  These benefits kept me going.However now that its January and Ive maintained a volume of  km per week all through the fall I now notice that the pace I hold with a  beats per minute has dropped from  to  per km.  To hold a  per km pace a year ago would have required a heart rate of  beats per minute.  So the speed improvement is now starting to show.Im  yo turning  in February.  Improvement is going to come slower to me.What is your volume per week?  Perhaps you need more volume?  Running order of operations from the sidebar,running,dbx69mm,2,t5_2qlit

Ive been browsing this subreddit for a couple of days to get myself a bit more educated in preparation for my run today and the thing I kept seeing all over the place was to START SLOW. I feel like I was going to fast out of the gate I found myself out of breath very quickly.I was running about bpm according to Spotify music which found my place and played music for me to sync my steps to and felt breathless a whole lot. Could it be because the trail I run is hilly? The trail is about .mi but distance shouldnt be the issue because I felt tired within two minutes of starting. I tried forcing myself to slow down but it felt harder to do that  is that supposed to happen? Or am I just not running with the right form?As a result of this I had to slow to a walk every couple of minutes.

You need to have enough in the tank for some workouts at approximately k pace and you should already have decent base endurance from your triathlon training.

10276201,0,t1_dc8tge4,Eh to be honest Id more go with what is comfortable but still easy than with what is an exact HR monitor match. I dont train by HR and neither do millions of other successful runners. Obviously loads of successful runners do train by HR but its perfectly fine to just go with whats comfortable and easy. You can actually hurt yourself by adjusting your stride in such a way that you end up running much slower I personally know that when I try to go slower than minmile pace I start having to do weird form adjustments to hit that pace and I actually get sore from it. Realistically Id recommend someone pay closer attention to HR training if  for example  theyre a competitive cyclist who is super cardiovascularly fit already but just starting to run. They can probably easily hammer out miles in the minmile pace range because theyre aerobically fit but they shouldnt because their body hasnt yet adjusted to the impact associated with those paces. Since youre just starting CK I assume this isnt your demographic.Just run at an easy pace that feels comfortable to you and doesnt cause you physical pain. Also because youre using mph I assume youre on a treadmill. I recommend getting off the treadmill and onto the roadstrailstrack and just feeling your pace out that way.,running,dc8v2nk,5,t5_2qlit

10292512,0,t1_dcanfck,At work about  years ago we talked about running the Kentucky Derby Half marathon. I trained barely with them. I have very bad allergies and didnt sleep for like two days prior to the race. I was in no shape to do it. Fast forward to early . Two good friendsco workers were talking about running the Half again. I once again signed up to run it with them different co workers. Well I barely trained for it meaning I just ran when I felt like it probably no more than  miles. Race day comes April . I finished in  with m pace which is a very flat race. I hit the wall bad at  miles in. I was in pain the rest of the race. I was in pain the following few days. I could have really hurt my self. I knew nothing about training or running long distance. Longest run I have ever done was probably  miles twenty years earlier while in the Army. Fast forward again to Oct  I ran a hilly half marathon at  with a pace of m mile. I took training seriously and followed a modified plan. I enjoy running always did. After I got out of the Army I got lazy then I got fat then even more lazy. I have lost lbs since just before I started running again until now. I plan to lose another  lbs. I have the derby half again this April where I plan to get to lt. With my first full marathon in October where I plan to be lt anywhere under . I prefer to run in the morning but with the cold weather lately I have had to run later in the day which makes it easy for me to skip it. I am still a lazy person.

If you cant run longer than k after  months of trying you are either physically disabled old or simply running way too fast. Dont worry about speed right now what you need the most is aerobic fitness and the way to build that is to spend a lot of time running even if its at a silly little shuffle.  minutes of silly shuffling still does about x more for your aerobic fitness than  minutes of hard running.First goal is to cover a significant distance speed comes later and mostly by itself as a result of running more.,running,dcjartj,5,t5_2qlit

10439100,0,t1_dcqz92e,The human body has several different energy systems.For purposes of long distance running the anaerobic phosphagen system can largely be ignored.The aerobic system uses oxygen to burn carbohydrates fat or less relevant proteins. This is a relatively slow process also known as the Krebs cycle but rather efficient. It turns one glucose molecule into up to  ATP molecules. The aerobic system consists of several chemical reactions and some of them can oxidate pyruvate ions which will be relevant below.The anaerobic glycolysis system creates two ATP molecules from glucose. For starters this is massively less effective at burning fuel than the aerobic system. But it also produces the energy much faster than the aerobic system. As side products of the aerobic system pyruvate ions and hydrogen ions are created. Under anaerobic conditions those can combine in the muscles to form lactate. The human liver but not the muscles can slowly convert lactate into pyruvate.The aerobic system will deal with some of the pyruvate ions. However when the aerobic system cannot handle the amount of pyruvate ions created in the muscles by the anaerobic system for example because of lack of oxygen lactate will build up quickly. That extra lactate is released into the blood stream to be transported to the liver.,running,dcrci0d,9,t5_2qlit

10501921,0,t3_5q9llk,TLDR I think Ive officially ran with enough consistency in the past two months that I can call myself a runner again  back on the bandwagon.The whole storyI played sports in high school football and bull riding but never ran competitively. I ran to get into shape and lifted weights. But nothing significant.Three years into college I helped push for my university through my involvement in student government to build a health and wellness center on the backs of students via a fee this building turned out amazing and is great for my alma mater...but I digress. The building would not be completed for years but the university bought the equipment and temporarily housed it in a spare building so students paying the fee would get some benefit even though they would never get to use the actual facility.Because I pushed for this I felt an obligation to lead by example and use the equipment. Thus began some occasional running via the treadmill. I had no idea what was far for distance or fast so I just got on and pushed buttons. Which in hindsight was amazing.I was a fairly big drinker but kept at it. Then I got an internship  miles away for the summer. I worked by day in a downtown office and didnt know anybody so I joined a downtown gym.A week or so later I randomly went to an MLB game and scalped a great seat for next to nothing in the rd inning. I ended up talking to the guy next to me he had scalped the ticket because a client had got sick and canceled. We became great friends.Neither one of us had ever ran in an event but one week after meeting we agreed to do a beer run . miles and  beers midrace at a festival in the neighborhood I lived in. Turns out I was good at running and already amazing at drinking. I was hooked.I kept doing runs. Often with this buddy. When I returned to my college community for a final semester I continued doing runs. Once getting nd overall in the mile division in a large charity run. Eventually I moved back to the internship city for hope of future employment.I kept running. Never with a watch and I couldnt tell you times. I was never the fastest but routinely placed in my age group .Fast forward a few years I still ran off and on with success at work came long billable days and more responsibility and eventually got a road bike. I started doing duathlons on occasion and was ok.My buddy that I mentioned above and I decided to do a marathon. He now lived a couple hours away but we texted every morning with our progress to competitively push one another. We were doing the exact same training plan.He started work at am every morning and always got his runs in first. So I would wake up with that text staring me in the face. We talked every day  and he became my closest friend and confidant. He had a little yearold boy with his wife and we spent hours talking about life. We would occasionally get together on the weekend for the long runs and did several half marathons in training. At this point I had done five  mile runs and was tapering.On the week of the marathon I was tripped sliding into rd base in a beer league kickball game causing me to jam my ankle when I hit the base. My ankle was shredded took me months to recover. And the marathon wasnt going to happen. Since I was hurt my buddy decided not to do the scheduled marathon back in my college community...top ranked run and do one really close to his current town a week later.I should have been there to support my friend. But I was devastated and went to Vegas on a whim instead. I went to my friends sons oneyear birthday party the weekend after his marathon. Everything was fine but I could tell he was disappointed that I wasnt there on race day.Two days later I got an early morning phone call. My friend had been killed in tragic farming accident and his wife found him when he didnt make it home.Instead of getting together to grill on Memorial Day Weekend as planned I carried him in a casket. Between his death and my injury I was done running. My friends wife and a few other friends decided to run the half marathon of the full he did one year later in his honor. I was still recovering from the injury but gutted it out. Over the course of the next couple years I sporadically ran. And also got more into biking and was showing improvement. I also started mountain biking. Eventually I started doing a few duathlons  once again placing in my age group .Then my world was dramatically changed. I was going to be a dad and the mom was a virtual stranger. Mid pregnancy a job opportunity to move back to my hometown  miles away developed. Even though I loved where I came from I never planned to return.But the small town is a great place to raise kids and the matched salary in the lower cost of living environment meant more security. I took the position and relocated with the mom to be. I grateful that she decided to do this despite our crazy situation.Fast forward . years I occasionally ran and biked but my tiny prairie town does not provide much in the way of motivation. We are  miles from the nearest stoplight and its more of a horse and motorcycle lifestyle.I have two little girls ages  and  that are the best thing to ever happen to me. I travel nationally for work  of the time and completely renovated the house I bought and am a very involved dad. So not much time for exercise. Also there was the sympathy weight and then some hard feelings from their mom when I did exercise because she struggled with the fact that her body was being so radically changed.The relationship was toxic but we love our kids. She bought a house  blocks away from me and we agreed to coparent  she moved out the weekend before Thanksgiving . The separation was ugly at first  there were a lot of hurt feelings.Eventually things smoothed out took nearly a year to finalize child support etc....was a lot more complicated because we were never married. I have  physical custody so basically if Im not traveling I have my girls. Which is wonderful for me still havent adjusted to a quiet house when they are not there. But makes it very difficult to exercise.In October I decided to cash in on a few miles and got a Garmin Forerunner . In early November I was traveling and running with a coworker. He told me about Maffetone heartrate training.This ended up being the key for me. I was so stuck on those times I used to put up before injury and  years of infrequent running and aging. I was finally able to let go of the past. Both running against the old me and the memories from running.In December I made a commitment to exercising no matter what. Whether or not I have the kids. Whether or not Im traveling. And Im not running fast. Im taking my sweet time even though  of the running is on the treadmill I live in a bitter cold area. I get up at  every morning when I have the girls so I can get a run in before the girls wake. I make it a point to book hotels with good exercise facilities. And Ive been lifting some weight again.Its been so freeing not caring about times. And Im getting a little faster regardless. I havent lost any weight and dont want to...Id actually like to put a little on currently   even. Ill probably never run minute miles again and thats ok. Ill probably never even do a sub k again. And thats ok.So after committing myself Ive put on  miles with a couple days to go in the past  weeks. This morning I set my fastest postbecomingadad k time inadvertently. And I think thats key. Not comparing myself to who I was...but who I am now. Im in my mid s and my priorities are my kids and then my job.I plan to run a couple half marathons this spring. And do some other long bike rides  mile gravel Grinder. I secretly long term hope to break  minutes pushing my girls in the stroller they weigh a combined  pounds  the  pound stroller. But wont beat myself up if I dont because I have a very long ways to go for that.And Im focused on overall life fitness now. Im doing the Murph Challenge with a buddy Memorial Day Weekend did a full one this past weekend but now need to add the lb weight vest. It wont be fast but that doesnt matter to me.It doesnt matter where youve been but rather where youre headed...or something like that...right? Anyway thanks to those of you who read this small novel. It felt good to finally get it all out.,running,dcyi5e0,4,t5_2qlit

So you benefit from them in training to because you feel faster and it might feel easier to hit your training pace.  If lightweight shoes get you to do your intervals  secmile faster for months that will have a bigger effect than waiting until race day to wear them.  But like I said if you dont feel the need for them then its not like youre hurting anything.

10868963,0,t1_de0zimy,Like Richie said mileage based plans come more into focus the faster you run as its going to assume that the time you take to run x miles is equivalent to x amount of time spent running.    There is some overlap but theres a difference between some running  miles at a minmi pace and someone that can run a minmi pace with one person putting in a larger amount of effort and impact to their system than the other.    Some plans account for this Daniels and use a combination of both timed runs as well as distance runs for interval work etc.    Other plans Pfitz may specify an overall distance to reach but include timed efforts that need to be done inside of those distances eg run mi but put min of that run at a tempo pace.       Like Richie said dont be afraid to try a distance based plan  but at the same time keep in mind where youre at and dont chose a high mileage one if youre not prepared to spend time on it.  ,running,de1217z,1,t5_2qlit

10946116,0,t3_5wbkoh,I had a very similar experience to yours.  I ended up working with a sports therapist who diagnosed it as a weakness in the muscle which controls how quickly the load on your foot is transitioned from heel or mid foot to toe during running.  Instead of a nice smooth transition to the toe mine took an sshaped curve with a rapid transition from the centerline of my foot towards the toe.  Hopefully that makes sense.  Imagine looking down the length of your foot and drawing a line down the center... then draw a line after your arch ends which quickly connects to the ball under your large toe.  My pain experience was almost exactly the same... during runs I felt great but walking especially up and down stairs was painful.  The pain was in a difficult to describe spot behind the shin but below the knee by  to  inches.  I have never had any issues with shin splints and have not had the issue reoccur after taking some steps to heal myself.  If it would help I could try and figure out which muscle  treatment from my experience. ,running,de90j4n,6,t5_2qlit

10952488,0,t3_5wf23n, weeks is a bit tight to build up serious mileage but if you can run  miles in  minutes keeping up with your mom at least wont be a problem AFAICT and all that lifting already does a lot for you. The main issue is covering the distance so what I would suggest is a simple plan Do  runs per week one long run and two easy runs. All of them at a comfortable pace that is significantly slower than your fastest mile time such that you can speak in whole sentences at all times a.k.a. conversation pace. Start out with x mi x mi for week . Slowing down should get you those extra  miles for the long run without trouble. Note that you should absolutely not feel wiped out at the end of your runs just pleasantly tired and you should be back to mostly normal  hours later. Then over then next  weeks gradually scale up the distance for all your runs such that you long run hits  miles by the end of week  and the shorter runs are in the  mile range. If you feel you can take more than  runs per week try  or . But do keep at least  rest days unless youre already running  per week right now in which case you might want to experiement with . Either way  is the bare minimum you need IMO. Reserve the last  weeks for tapering that is gradually bring your volume down so that youre fully rested for the race. No more long runs during this period and the distance for your training runs can be reduced down to  or so for the last week in fact if you still feel beaten up one week before the race you should do as little as it takes to get you back to normal even not running at all for the last week wont really hurt your performance itll just feel weird.On top of that Pay close attention to your body. Youre on a fairly aggressive buildup here chances are some part of your body cant take it and there will be pain or deep exhaustion. When that happens skip a run shorten one of your long runs or reduce the buildup rate even if that means you wont hit  miles by the end its better to be undertrained than injured. Do not try to make up for skipped runs the rule of thumb is to let bygones be bygones. It pays to improve your running form but dont let online videos and stuff like that make you nervous. Just try to stay as relaxed as possible keep your stride short and your knees slightly bent thats  of it already. The rest follows in due time. Get your sleep patterns down. Sleeping well is one of the best things you can do to make your running better. Get yourself decent running shoes unless you run barefoot  minimalist already in which case just keep going. Lots of bro science in this area the three basic rules however  if it feels comfortable its probably right for you if it doesnt it is definitely not right for you  if in doubt go for less shoe less cushioning less support less stiffness less pronation control  shoes do not solve running problems the best shoe just doesnt create any running problems.,running,de9o6fy,3,t5_2qlit

I will say that you dont need anything terribly expensive. Even for temps in the s and maybe s shorts  a long sleeve cotton shirt will do well. Throw in some gloves or pull the long sleeves down around your hands put a cap on and you should be ok to go. ,running,den11e4,1,t5_2qlit

My guess is theres nothing in the MRI to suggest its anything other than plain old PF and that its just taking forever to heal. Ive given a lot of thought to running again. Believe it or not Ive been leaning towards not running anymore whether my foot heals or not. Its still up in the air though. I might feel differently if I was completely painfree.

I never went to the doctor couple different reasons for that just rested for many weeks.  I also eased back into it after that.  What reassured me was that the pain gradually reduced and was only really present when I pushed off with that leg  slow walking was OK.  This injury is usually from a sudden movement though.

11541307,0,t1_dg478qn,Yeah its always tough to start back into motion but assuming you keep your pace steady and quick the transition is not too bad. It also gets easier. Youve just got to get the legs used to it. Ive been having some doubts about trying to follow the  at EU after finishing my last race. Ive been focused on smashing my walking speed game and now Im wondering if I should use my experience with walking when I feel like it opposed to walking at set times. EU being a M loop I think I may pick walking points instead of going by time. This gives you a fixed location to transition tofrom a different pace thus giving you something to look forward to. A  plan works but since your pace varies where you stop to walkrun is always changing and thatll eventually get screwed up if it happens at an aid station you dont want to stop at or at the canopy.

11643658,0,t3_663caa,Have you ever been to a chiropractor and gotten any x rays done? I was in a similar situation as you in about two months ago. As I was running I felt my calf tighten up and I couldnt run anymore. I rested for a week until the pain was gone and after running  miles the tightness was back. According to the chiropractor it is because one of my legs is shorter about  inch than the other and all my running was causing my shorter leg to tighten up. I also went to an acupuncturist who found I had an old injury on my butt on the side of my shorter leg probably from falling on it when I was little which had turned into a hard muscle knot that also kept pulling my calf muscles. Ive been getting treatment from both every week to both adjust my shorter leg back to normal position and loosen the knot on my butt. My calf has gotten much better and I am finally able to build up to  miles a day after almost two months. Edit I just want to add that I know how you feel about this injury coming on just when you start to feel like youre getting really fit. Same here.

Massage can be hard on soft tissue especially damaged soft tissue. You likely overloaded it either during the tempo run or after with inadequate easyrest so look at this as a learning experience. Its hard to know exactly what caused a niggle and what to do but rest and cross training can always help.

11686787,0,t1_dgkfr3m,Your feedback is much appreciated thank you. The animation is slowed down x so my cadence is actually right at  bpm here and Im not sure the stride length itself is the problem though the overstriding certainly is as you mention in point .Ive been sticking to asphalt in a desperate try to get used to it before my upcoming race but thatll soon be over one way or another at which point trails are a good idea.The heel drop is a good point  I ended up with these shoes after being evaluated on a treadmill at my LRS I guess based on the forefoot striking but obviously thats impacted by my overstriding. Ill try to fix the latter first but maybe that will lead to new shoes as well.,running,dgkpqtf,2,t5_2qlit

Fair shake up to the system to be honest although a good thing for me as it seems to have regulated me a bit better all round. Also what sort of speed are you doing?

I didnt have chemo for my skin cancer  but my main tumor was taken out of my left leg and all of my lymph nodes were taken out too so I had two months of bed rest that was weird to come back to running after. I just paid attention to what felt okay. The only thing Id have to give as a caution is about the lymph nodes  if youve had any of them removed itll take a minute for blood flow in those areas to get back on track so things will feel weird and constrained.

Enter the Streak Runner badge on Smashrun which got me thinking about starting streak.  At first I would run just a single mile on those restCT days.  Usually I was doing something at the gym for CT and since it was only a mile away I started running there and back.  Running on the plan CTrest days eventually worked up to  miles.Recently Ive started getting into higher mileage plans that run  days a week with my shortest days being  mile recovery runs.
