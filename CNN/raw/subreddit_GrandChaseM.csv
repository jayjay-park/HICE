4744185,0,t1_ctrz35b,I used apostle for a little bit but found his cd was too long. The problem with mushroom is that he gets his heal at  so you have to work on him before he becomes decent and he takes up fire essence which elesis and ley need also. He also only heals the people around him so only the melee people get healed.But with that said i still dont regret making him a . He heals my guys for .k every  seconds for  seconds. then after those  seconds i have  seconds left of cd left until he can cast it again. ,GrandChaseM,ctsjsbu,1,t5_39a3t
