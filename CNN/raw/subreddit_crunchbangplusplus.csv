One of my friends told me that they are really great because the Linux and stuff but it seems kind of annoying the boot process.

7160073,0,t1_d1s0jef,Hello salemcmr         sounds like a lot of hours of work you spent. Or should I say a lot of hours of fun? Howsoever ... thanks for your feedback.        I asked the question because last year the emotions boiled over because SystemD. And Devuan wanted to position itself as an alternative to Debian.        The whole systemd vs sysVinit situation doesnt really affect an enduser in any way. Most of the complaints are from developers and sysadmins from what Ive seen. Basically as only a user I shouldnt care about what init system my OS use.,crunchbangplusplus,d1s14hd,1,t5_3773v
