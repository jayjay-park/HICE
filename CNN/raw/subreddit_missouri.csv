197572,0,t3_1wcq0k,Yes KC and St. Louis are pretty cool but lets throw some other thoughts in there Katy Trail The largest rails to trails in the country.  Its a great trail that used to be a railroad.  Id suggest visiting it right along Rocheport right along I and walking east.  It gives a great view of the Missouri river and reminds you of what Lewis and Clark two guys who visited the lower  states way before you did would have seen. Columbia MO I know this was already mentioned but its a good town to visit especially the University of Missouri. Hermann MO Some pretty vistas on the trip about  minutes south of I and lots of great wineries.  Also check out Augusta for wineries. St. Joseph MO About  minutes north of KC but it has some pretty cool museums including the Pony Express Stables and the Glore Psychiatric Museum where you can see how they used to treat mental illnesses.,missouri,cf0y22c,5,t5_2qham
275445,0,t1_cf96w94,Yes I believe it is an oversimplification. I dont think anyone wants to do away with the institution of marriage. I think the response to that would be something like What if white people can get married but black people can get civil unions. Would that be OK? I know thats not what you are saying but thats how it would be framed. We really just need to repeal the antigay amendment or have it found unconstitutional under equal protection.

Last time I waiting in line there they came down the line with a plate of free ribs! Theres a Potbellys somewhere or Amaghettis if you like sandwiches.If you like flowers check out the Jewel box at Forest Park. If you like art got to the art museum there. Definitely check out the science center Old Courthouse Wainwright Building and theres shopping in the Galleria another mall I forget or Chesterfield although thats a drive. I would recommend walking around downtown during the DAY because we have a lot of interesting architecture. Oh Union Station is beautiful! Great Architecture. Theres also a post modern building somewhere. Heck if I know. Oh! And the City Garden! Its a little park thingy downtown its great filled with art. Oh! And tour Budweiser its a great time it also includes Clydesdales for horse lovers. Also go to Blueberry Hill its a great barrestaurantconcert place in an area we Saint Louisans call The Loop.

1770617,0,t3_2erfml,I think SDC is pretty universally considered the best of those three especially if you consider having a theme to be an important part of a theme park.  Now theyve got some great rollercoasters too so its probably not even close.I havent been to Six Flags but WOF is my local park.  It used to be fun when I was a kid and they actually still used the around the world theme but now its pretty much just a mishmash of various generic amusement parks.  It has no character.

11684851,0,t1_dgkgv34,That school literally saved my life. Im much older now but when I was  I was mixed up with a rough crowd doing drugs etc. I eventually got sent Wentworth and it completely turned things around. It taught me discipline gave me a sense of pride for the first time i was part of something that mattered that I was willing to bleed for and did in fact. Afterwards I graduated college started a great career and have lived a generally blessed and successful life. By contrast every one of my preWentworth friends are either in prison dead or wasting away on meth. Wentworth is a historical institution and the cultural loss alone is tragic. But when I look back at my experience and think how many other kids were saved its staggering. One generation of incompetent dishonest board members ruined the best thing that ever happened to me and I hate them for that. Mostly though I hate that the next group of troubled kids wont have the same opportunity I did. Such a sad fucking waste. ,missouri,dgkhu6k,3,t5_2qham
