7462528,0,t1_d2pweyr,Im surprised you didnt get into UTSC coop with that average too. Anyways sure go ahead call and ask if you want a reason UTSC registrar office is quite helpful too. Just keep in mind you really dont need to worry about it. At the end of first year students have to select their Subject Posts and you can switch into coop at that time just have a GPA above . first year and youll be fine. The plus of not being enrolled straight into coop is you dont have to pay extra coop fees and attend boring seminars first year. Either way coop placement start nd year.,UTSC,d2qfyux,1,t5_2ssr7

11207808,0,t3_5zy66i,Okay so heres a list of jobs that was taken for CS coop from the middle of Janruary when I copied the list of jobs down. A few things to note before you read the list. This is not a full list IBM RBC and Blackberry among others posted jobs shortly after this list was made. However most IBM postings were  to  months in length so not a lot of my friends went for those. Most jobs can be readily found outside of coop and dont require being in the program. For example you can find blackberrys postings here for the summer Similarly RBC has hired my UTSC friends from outside of the coop program. Ive accepted my job outside of the coop program recently as well.Out of  jobs on this list only  are software development. Of those  the bulk of the developer positions are at CIBC.
