10558698,1,t1_dd4uted,gtFor the Record Its funny r TheDonald uses the term Shills so much when they ARE the ACTUAL Shills.Not going to comment elsewhere in this sub so I think its safe to say my piece here before filtering it out.  You have enough to deal with.For one us being Shills would be monstrously expensive.  If we can agree on at least one thing Trump did not spend a great deal of money on his campaign.  Plus we figure CTR was only about  people tops.  That small group consumed about M per month.  Most of your shill accusations are probably due to David Brock very publicly getting another M for similar operations some of which were certainly focused on Reddit.  My opinion on the topic?  If David Brock wants to spend money pissing into an ocean of piss hes more than welcome to.Second this is fun for some of us for a variety of reasons for some its memes others test different debate tactics still more are simply in it to troll.  This isnt to say that were not serious we just dont find it serious enough to apply more energy.  This is our ground state.  As an example of what happens when were energized check out Wikileaks Central Station and how our subreddit tilted news coverage for a solid month due to our efforts to sift through mountains of information to find the gems scattered inside.  Seeing as TD has added over  users since election day I imagine you would not like to see what happens online if it become energized that way again.,MarchAgainstTrump,dd4y4o2,5,t5_3itci

Also look at the actual cooperation between branches. Theres been practically none. Trump didnt talk to Congress before trying his travel ban. Congress has essentially done nothing. They repealed a single lateObama regulation. You may look at things like the DeVos nomination as an example of them going in with Trump but thats wrong. That was Trump AND congress both giving in to DeVos.Are the failures of men like Chaffetz to go after Trump with their investigative and revelatory powers worrying? Yes.

10935989,0,t3_5w5xdy,b reduction in debt is meaningless. The US debt is the value of treasury bonds plus interest that investors have purchased and currently hold. When those come due the US has to pay back the money lent and the interest. Treasury bonds come in various denominations of years. A batch possibly came due and the US paid out the money to the investors and took the bonds back and destroyed them.Now think about that. We used to owe b but now instead we no longer have b in actual cash. Were not better off. And that cash is also put into the system by other investors buying treasury bonds and is backed by debt. It doesnt work like credit cards or home mortgages folks. Its not the same at all.

10939279,0,t3_5vg5sk,Worse taking the position that the foreignemoluments clause doesnt even apply to him Trump has stated that I can be President of the United States and run my business  percent sign checks on my business. And The law is totally on my side meaning the president cant have a conflict of interest. To address this unprecedented corruption of the Oval Office and this threat to our Constitution and our democracy we believe Congress must move forward now with an impeachment investigation of President Trump. More than  people from across the country have already called for this joining a new campaign launched moments after President Trump took the Oath of Office. The Presidents possible conflicts of interest have become increasingly apparent.In the meantime instead of starting to make America great again the th President should read the Constitution and make the President honest again.After all he swore to uphold the Constitution. I love how the Donald subs are coming here to talk shit. Intelligence expert  years ago Trump would have faced a treason trial after being coopted by Putin At this point it would be pretty easy to impeach Donald Trumpif Congress wanted to.In a freewheeling interview with the staff of The New York Times the presidentelect made a series of comments that lend credence to the suspicion that hes running afoul of the emolument clause of the Constitution which prevents the president from being bribed by foreign powers. He said that his Washington D.C. hotel is probably a more valuable asset than it was before all but acknowledging reports that foreign diplomats are using the hotel to curry favor with him. He also said that he might have brought up the issue of wind farms near his Scottish golf courses when talking with Britains Nigel Farage suggesting he was angling for a quid pro quo. Fuck the donald. Worst subreddit in history. Durrr cuck durrr high energy durrr very fake news God you sound like fucking  year old pussies. Considering the only ban thats actually had any actual success in any way relating to them or their orange idol is the millions of users who have filtered their stupid asses its not surprising that its becoming a wasteland of bots and Russian shills. Well considering how most users on T Donald are willfully ignorant of the actual actions of their God king in comparison to the hot air that he blows Id say that T Donald is still in the denial stage. When you have a sitting president whos so awful at his job as Donnie is go through such extreme damage control as to hold rallies and deny press coverage because of muh MSM bullshit and fake news things arent going too well. You have a lot of converts who voted for the dumb bastard that realize hes full of shit and have backpedaled then you have others that are still on the Cheeto bandwagon because they dont want to admit they were wrong the worst in my opinion. I think a lot of whats going on right now is a tremendous amount of Stockholm syndrome from the Cheeto crowd. As much as the TD gang wants to call liberals fags and sore losers MSM fake media etc etc etc its a poignant example of how dangerous it is to put someone in charge thats so wilfully and blatantly ignorant of being at least reminiscent of being a reasonable adult in charge of the nation. Some bad shit will happen God King Cheeto will be impeached and replaced by whom the repubs ACTUALLY want as POTUS Pence if youre wondering and things will be back to normal once our voting base realizes the wrong things theyve done. Oh by the way I guess draining the swamp actually meant making the swamp twice as deep with twice the amount of slime shit corruption and monsters trying to run our great nation into the ground. TD will be stopped. TD is nothing. WE own TD. I can feel their saltiness. Has anyone seen rTheDonald lately? It is CRUMBLING! Sad place to be honest. Low energy fountain of spam. It has gone down hill FAST. They KNOW it we KNOW it and AMERICA knows it. rTheDonald is TRIGGGGGGERED! and we LOVE IT. Look at their top post. They are SO mad we are growing faster than them. We are going to win in  and . The energy has shifted. TD is nothing but low energy now. Its sad. It really is. We know it they know it and AMERICA knows it. Look at their ShariaBlue Post right now.Trump just doubled down on his Sweden claims in his CPAC speech. Trump is scared. Does it hurt? Does it hurt the nation? Obama was our god. Obama was the chosen one. Obama was the one who provided. We wanted Obama. You took away. Hillary won the primary vote. How do you explain this? Hillary won the election. Never heard of the foreignemoluments clause? Youre not alone. Its tucked away in Article I Section  of the Constitution. Its clause number . It states in pertinent part ... no person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under the United States shall without the Consent of the Congress accept of any present Emolument Office or Title of any kind whatever from any King Prince or foreign State. Trump is KILL. But I want to come to a point that was made a little bit earlier he added. When did all of this happen to Donald Trump right? He met Gorbachev. He was a big supporter of glasnost. At some point he was coopted by Vladimir Putin. and that means he bought into and embraced the dictatorial ideology that was done by a spy master of the KGB. Ten years ago  years agothere would be treason trials. I would like to bring one point up. because long ago there was a guy named Yuri Bezmenov a KGB officer and he wroteThis is who the KGB targeted and recruited egocentric people who lack moral principles and who are too greedy or who suffer from exaggerated selfimportance. These are the people the KGB wants and finds easiest to recruit. TRUMP MUST DIE. Where Trump runs afoul of the foreignemoluments clause is that first and foremost he is a businessman with significant financial interests and governmental entanglements all over the globe. Indeed as Norman Eisen Richard Painter and Laurence Tribe stated at the Brookings Institution Never in American history has a President presented more conflict of interest questions and foreign entanglements than Donald Trump. Moreover Trumps businesses dealings are veiled in complicated corporate technicalities and lack transparency. A RACIST BIGOT PRESIDENT. WE SHALL BURN HIM DOWN DOWN TO THE GROUND? Presidents and public officers often utilize blind trusts so as not to violate the foreignemoluments clause. A truly blind trust involves an arrangement wherein the public officer has no control whatsoever over the assets placed in the trust  that means no communications with from or about the trust. is. formed. Vladimir Putin went to the Yuri Andropov school of intelligence he learned how to manipulate people and at some point we need to find out when did Donald Trumps ideology shift from western capitalism to Russian authoritarianism Nance concluded. Honestly IM so fucking salty. HOW does this orange twat get the electoral vote? If anything the electoral should be replaced.  vote equals  vote. Hillary having an IT issue isnt grounds for treason. Bush had a private email server too but mysteriously Republicans didnt make that into scandal. The House Intelligence Committee is also investigating communications between Trump aides and Russia. On the other hand colluding with a foreign authoritarian power in exchange for election help is treason. Try counting his cabinet picks that have histories of doing business in Russia.We must have a truly independent commission to investigate the actions of the President his campaign his associates and Russian officials and agents Cummings said. The American people will not stand for an investigation that is tainted that inappropriately shares information with the Presidents team or that serves as nothing more than the Presidents political mouthpiece. Please tell me trump had no ties to Russia the data points entirely to that direction. . Putin and trump have been long time friends thats no secreat.

10944069,0,t1_de8rn6w,Many Trump supporters here believe that reddit has so many upvoted stories negative about Trump because Shareblue and CTR pay people to upvote them and comment in them. Not that people just really dont like Trump.Now dont get me wrong that does indeed happen. The most important time in a posts life is the first  minutes and if you can drive a couple hundred upvotes to a post itll generally take off so for a couple hundred bucks you can buy those upvotes or pay people to do the work. Its how companies and advertisers have done it for awhile now and political groups caught on a few years ago as well. However there are two sides to the coin and the GOP also has groups that do the same thing. In fact some of the Republican Super Political Actions Committees hire outside groups that use machine learning to determine which kind of headlines are most likely to be shared.Its very interesting stuff and part of our new reality here online so always remember that when talking to people online or reading something.

It left me wondering if theyve even read it. The whole argument is that its GOP propaganda spread through social media and I used the evidence to come a conclusion independently.  Idk... independent research of the source material and supplementary analysis from academic sources gt someones analysis of reddit user behavior conducted with dubious assumptions and flawed methodology they mass tagged people with a script....

10973601,0,t1_deabwdg,You obviously dont understand how or why the electoral college system was created. You made all that shit up. Its all revisionist history. The electoral college was created not for slave states but so rural states with smaller populations got the same amount of voting power that coastal heavily populated states got. Without an elecotoral system the east and west coast urban sprawls NY SF LA etc. would decide  of national elections. Smart people realized that giving voters in rural environments a say in the voting process is beneficial to everyone except for closeminded people like you who refuse to accept others opinions.gt The playing field is by definition not even. Voters in certain states have  times the voting power of voters in other states. The playing field can never be even in such a situation.Without the electoral college voters in certain states CA NY Mass etc would have  of the voting power while most other states got  of the voting power so youre contradicting yourself and proving why we need an electoral college system using your own words. I dont have to prove you wrong because youre doing it yourself already.gt No I wouldnt I have been against this broken system since well before this election and implying I am as childish as you and would act the same way you are now is a disgusting accusation. bucks says you didnt even know what the fuck the electoral college was before this election. ,MarchAgainstTrump,debv4oh,1,t5_3itci

If you go back in time youll see my account was made right after Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump rescinded the guidance for trans children in school. It was obvious dogwhistle politics to appeal to those on the religious right that want to harm my community. Similar sorts of efforts were made in Putins administration under the baseless protect the children argument and as result the LGBT community has taken a lot of damage in Russia.On top of that a lot of what was posted in TD was along the Russian propaganda lines as well. The same sort of stuff used to denigrate the LGBT community over there. Lots a posts based on sources like AcPeds a hategroup classified fake pediatric organization with a name close to real one that doesnt even believe gay people should adopt. All of which is even scarier when taken in the context that evangelicals have been in contact with the Russians for years.For me that was the last straw. Barely anyone outside the press even cared or saw the significance of what he did.e Thats when I became Inumbrate. For me every day is another day counting down from that moment.

Look how in this thread theyre denying statistics and scientific fact to push their Islamophobic narrative.The fact is were not dealing with two equal side. This is the false equivalency fallacy that both sides have equally valid points when in reality Trump supporters are less educated more emotional and less intelligentgtClinton wins the collegeeducated segment by  percentage points while Trumps edge among those without a college education is  points. gtEven though past studies show that women are more liberal than men and blacks are more liberal than whites the effect of childhood intelligence on adult political ideology is twice as large as the effect of either sex or race.  So it appears that as the Hypothesis predicts more intelligent individuals are more likely to espouse the value of liberalism than less intelligent individuals possibly because liberalism is evolutionarily novel and conservatism is evolutionarily familiar.gtWe proposed and tested mediation models in which lower cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice an effect mediated through the endorsement of rightwing ideologies social conservatism rightwing authoritarianism and low levels of contact with outgroups. In an analysis of two largescale nationally representative United Kingdom data sets N   we found that lower general intelligence g in childhood predicts greater racism in adulthood and this effect was largely mediated via conservative ideologygtLliberals would be more flexible and reliant on data proof and analytic reasoning and conservatives are more inflexible prefer stability emotiondriven and connect themselves intimately with their ideas making those beliefs a crucial part of their identity we see this in more highempathyexpressing individuals. This fits in with the whole family values platform of the conservative party and also why we see more religious folks that identify as conservatives and more skeptics agnostics and atheists that are liberal.gtConservatives would be less likely to assign value primarily using the scientific method. Remember their thinking style leads primarily with emotion.This emotional and nonintellectual way of thinking is especially prominent in conservative males who tend to be higher testosterone and less concerned about the welfare of othersgtMen who are strong are more likely to take a rightwing stance while weaker men support the welfare state researchers claim.gtTheir study discovered a link between a mans upperbody strength and their political views.

11548853,0,t1_dg4sxdo,Quite the response! I will try to match.I live in Seattle and am a conservative so a little the opposite of yourself. I think it is important to make distinction between the GOP and being a conservative. From HW Bush to Obama we have gotten neocon foreign policy interventionist and regime change policies and neoliberal domestic policy welfare state financialization of economy degeneracy anti religion. The only representation of American conservative values in terms of candidates was Trump which is how someone can vote for him.I just disagree with what you say is hypocritical. Its not black and white like you make it seem. Ive got no problem criticizing the corruption of politicians on both sides get McCain and Graham out of there! If I decided to vote for Trump thinking him the lesser of evils that is not hypocrisy.I watched the investigation and I know the conclusions. I believe Obama and Hillary are responsible for the destabilization of Libya and by extension the refugee crisis.You didnt need a scandal to not vote for Hillary. You simply cannot be a conservative and align with the liberal social engineering agenda. It is simply impossible. Basic fundamentals of western society are undermined by the left my example is the family unit being completely dismantled. If you were practical you would also be fiscally conservative which the left is not and has never been it is why Seattle is in huge debt with huge homelessness ready to put vending machines in the streets with clean needles for the junkies! If you want a reason to be conservative again just look where the social engineering is taking us.Hillary lacks moral integrity like Ive never seen before!Dude fuck the golf weekends though I agree lol how about the Trump admin action on Syria before investigation into chemical attacks. Also republicans allowing ISP to sell consumer history is another legit reason to be angry at repubs. In short I cant even begin to align with the ideology of the left as a conservative and I will be very happy when we get our conservative justice so we can stop supreme court legislation from the bench.Yeah man thanks for the explanation.

Letting Assad get away with it  means Russia can break extreme sanctions while America is too scared to retaliate even in minor amounts destroy the airfield responsible for the bombings cant even think of a punishment more minor but they still failed that against Russia. Once you become afraid of something it doesnt matter how much power you have.

11593650,0,t1_dga4swc,Transgender women tend to have brain structures that resemble cisgender women rather than cisgender men. Two sexually dimorphic areas of the brain are often compared between men and women. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalus and sexually dimorphic nucleus of transgender women are more similar to those of cisgender woman than to those of cisgender men suggesting that the general brain structure of these women is in keeping with their gender identity.Note that maletofemale transgender women had a BSTc more closely resembling that of cisgender women than men in both size and cell density and femaletomale transgender men had BSTcs resembling cisgender men. These differences remained even after scientists take into account the fact that many transgender men and women in these studies take estrogen and testosterone during their transition  by including cisgender men and women who were also on hormones not corresponding to their assigned biological sex. These findings have been confirmed and corroborated in other studies and other regions of the brain including a region of the brain called the sexually dimorphic nucleus which is believed to affect sexual behavior in animals.,MarchAgainstTrump,dga5cvp,12,t5_3itci
