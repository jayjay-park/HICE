5012669,0,t1_cuq7149,No worries! I love helping out     I know that transferring between two  year universities is more difficult than transferring between a Community College and a  year  but it is not impossible! The difference is really just with who gets preferences. Those transferring from a Community College will get preference over those transferring from another  year university especially if there is a big difference between the prestige of those universities. Would you mind sharing more info about the program you are at? First why Sacramento and not Fresno? What exactly is holding you up with graduating?     At Fresno State the psych program is definitely doable in . years if you are done with GEs. So Im curious as to what it is about Sac States program that is causing you to last  more years. ,fresnostate,cuq7sk7,1,t5_2sdt5
