2226864,0,t1_clmugt8,Lol yeah nobody showed! To be expected the event was quite isolated and Id need willing participants. Not the kind of thing to be sprung on unsuspecting folks nor would I likely be able to get too far without dedicated attention.I wandered off for a bit I do that. It mostly had to do with a busy and stressful work season and a need to focus on my responsibilities. Those are lightening up so here I am I was really hoping that the sub would do its own thing. Ill admit I wasnt super comfortable having an audience. This isnt a project for me Im not the kind of person who has a lifestyle that allows me to run a sub well.As for the phenomenon the next step is to hook up an EEG and measure some stuff! Some friends and I have the background its just a matter of planning and clearing the plate. Ive visited the state a few times since then looks the same! Definitely more of a calm and comfortable feeling theres not a lot of jarring new insights. Just a calm affirmation of thoughts and my place in the world and refocusing on simply doing the work that needs to be done.But I couldnt help but notice that people are connecting to the ideas in my absence. So in service to their interest here I am! And How are you?,ConnectTheOthers,clmvz50,1,t5_2zf16

5927349,0,t1_cxwht4b,Thank you for the input its my nature to question things and I am enjoying that part of my experience of being separate. While universally we may all be one I believe we came here to experience what it is like to be separate. This thought helps ease my mind a little. Still I search for knowledge. Overall I have a hard time accepting the cycle of life. Something seems off about it to me. We will see what time and thought produce over time.,ConnectTheOthers,cxwlums,1,t5_2zf16
