10564953,0,t3_5r2dkk,The dog by Francisco Goya. Romanticism artist Although this piece doesnt have a night sky it still achieves a sense of darkness. Personally I believe the painting speaks of isolation hopelessness and silence which is befitting to Goya as he became deaf near the end of his life as a result of his declining health in which caused him to isolate himself. Due to this his mental wellbeing took a dramatic dip and he undertook a more darker choice of subject matter in his work which are known as black paintings. According to art historians this painting depicts of Goyas struggle against his mental illness as the dog is seen buried in quicksand or some other substance unable to free itself.Art critic Robert Hughes quotes We do not know what it means but its pathos moves us on a level below narrative.,Exhibit_Art,dd5nnt3,4,t5_3i4g9
10661996,0,t1_ddfp2ne,For me the unsettling part is that the roof is nearly the same color as the sky which is itself devoid of detail or gradient. Along with the unusually stark lighting it makes the whole thing look like a model placed in front of a grayish background.The emptiness is reminiscent of those idyllic little homes set up during the Manhattan Project. You could almost imagine the silhouette belonging to a mannequin left behind in such a house.This is an image of a sky a house a woman and a yard... and not a single hint of life in any of them. The sky tells me nothing about the weather. The house tells me nothing of its history. The woman tells me nothing of her identity. The yard... I cant decide whether its more stale in the sun or in the shade.I cant even mentally zoom out from the picture! There are no details to reconstruct its surroundings no neighborhood no shadows of trees no horizon. In my head zooming out only reveals more gray sky and an infinite expanse of empty yard.,Exhibit_Art,ddfpcdj,6,t5_3i4g9
10746615,0,t3_5sfws1,The New Bonnet Francis William Edmonds Oil on CanvasIn a setting influenced by the established formulas of seventeenthcentury Dutch masters Edmonds contrasts the daughters extravagant purchase of a new bonnet with the faults of her disapproving parents. The fathers bottle and glass and the mothers mirror imply indulgence in drink and vanity respectively. The poor delivery girl serves as an added moral gibe to the comfortable middleclass family. A fantastic insight into the domestic life during the th century.I particularly enjoy the use of colors in this piece. It relies heavily on brownish hues but still manages to seem vibrant and filled with life. Additionally the details on the faces of the depicted individuals helps pull the looker in and consider their motivations and thoughts. ,Exhibit_Art,ddofjq0,3,t5_3i4g9

This can be avoided however by moving a single number in the hexadecimal code. As for a white painting Im pretty sure there are a ton of things like that the one that comes to my mind is the one from Netflixs Daredevil but this white painting is a pretty standard example of monochromatic abstraction and the standard expectation for how people approach monochromatic abstraction is to meditate create an emotional connection and get lost in the details. Im  not sure of any particularly famous white monochrome paintings but Ill do some research later todaythis week. ,Exhibit_Art,de2g4z7,3,t5_3i4g9

11137400,0,t3_5xx3u1,Sir John Everett Millais Ophelia  I dont read much Shakespeare so the narrative elements of this piece went right over my head. Instead I find it intriguing for its unique and eerily serene composition. To me this was just a woman floating peacefully down a small flowery stream. Extracted from its story it becomes so contrived as to be surreal.In the play Hamlet Ophelia is overcome with some form of madness and falls from a broken branch overhanging a brook while climbing a tree. This painting shows her lazily singing while the water carries her downstream unaware or unconcerned with her own peril. After awhile the air pockets leak from beneath her dress and the weight of water pulls her down to her death.Critics at the time disliked the small humble brook and its unthreatening flora.gt Why the mischief should you not paint pure nature and not that rascally wirefenced gardenrollednurserymaids paradise?To me thats the element that sets the painting apart in the first place. Its unexpected and its simple. The woman drowns not because the water forced her down but because she didnt put up any fight. It makes her death seem unavoidable as if she might have suffered the same fate in a puddle where one nearby. Its as if she died of not living rather than of being drowned.,Exhibit_Art,deuevs9,2,t5_3i4g9
