5104911,0,t1_cv0qp6k,projektx gave a great explanation  Ill add my  cents and it took all the rest of us years to learn this! We were over our heads once too.These are a few of the  nuts in my hardware box There are lots of flavors of nuts to put on a boltscrew depending on what it has to do which direction its loaded thicker nuts for tension loads smaller for sidetoside shear and what kind of environment its in.Most structure is held together with nylock nuts called by their specification number AN or AN which are just regular nuts with a plastic insert that grabs onto the bolt when you tighten it so it doesnt rattle loose.But for the engine compartment where there might be a fire you want allmetal construction so those nuts are actually deliberately squished slightly outofround. They wont shake loose and theyre smallerlighter but they scrape the threads of the bolt theyre installed on. There are a few different coatings that go on to help that. And then there are a bunch of other variations of nut if theyre forming a rotating pivot joint they have castle cutouts for the little cotter pin that keeps them in place.A regular nylock nut with the plastic locking insert will work for  of installations but the great thing about all that variety available is that you can pick just the right piece of hardware if you know whats needed for the application. Edit the runon torque thing  because these nuts grip the threads of the boltscrew theyre being installed on it takes a certain amount of twisting just to get them to move. You want the nuts to be snugged up against whatever surface theyre clamping so when you tighten them you have to take into consideration the amount of torque it takes just to get them to move and add the clamping torque on top of that.,homebuilt,cv1bywk,2,t5_2tapu

Flat patterns drawn on TurboCAD a simple drafting program about  exported to .dxf files and emailed. . pilot holes on everything. Aluminum up to . was done with laser and water for anything above that. All  was done with water so I wouldnt get a hardened heataffectedzone tough to drill out. It turned out really well and I didnt have to invest in any CNC or cutting equipment. All the flat stock for my project small singleseater was about k. ,homebuilt,d2pfjep,6,t5_2tapu

9367100,0,t3_58tr3q,Airplane horizontal tails are made of two surfaces connected by a hinge  the elevator at the back for control and the horizontal stabilizer at the front for stability.You want the tail assembly set to slightly different angles for different speeds eg cruise vs. landing which can be done by a couple methods An adjustable trim tab on the back of the elevator which changes its steadystate angle or you can adjust the angle with which the horizontal stabilizer is mounted to the fuselage and this gauge is telling you what that angle is. The adjustment is usually done by a jackscrew connected to the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer inside the tailcone.Its a critical piece of flight equipment,homebuilt,d93chzj,1,t5_2tapu
