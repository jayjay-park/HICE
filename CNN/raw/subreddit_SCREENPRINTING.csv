143343,0,t3_1voktc,If you publish your work online people might steal it or the idea of it. But once you publish it online you create a copyright not to mention a timedate stamp. It is your intellectual property and you dont need an official copyright to confirm that. A trademark is something else.Someone cannot steal what you publish online and use it in a business save the terms and conditions of corporations that you agree to like Facebook etc.. If they do and you catch it you might have a case at least cease and desist. People steal things that people publish online and share it widely without giving credit to the original creator. Fine. It happens and completely impossible to regulate. The key for suit involves widespread dissemination andor .Now legally speaking the copyright act from the s couldnt foresee the internet so it doesnt technically include internet publication. But a strong reasonable case can be made in the favor of internet publication and the retention of copyright and intellectual property rights. I dont think any rational being could say that if you put your own original design on your own website for the world to see it is not publishing. If anyone does heshe holds dearly to antiquated notions and fears new realities.If youre paranoid do not publish your ideaswork. Or lower the resolution substantially and put a digital watermark on the image. If you sell prints of the image however you cannot prevent someone from taking a high res photo of the image and disseminating it.If you sell something that has your logoslogan on it the logoslogan already becomes protected. Youll need to file the trademark to get registered but selling a thing with the logoslogan shows use in commerce from what I understand and is protected to an extent.,SCREENPRINTING,ceura1g,5,t5_2r7ky

I print to all channels as well but maintain the color inks in the carts. AccuRip is set to x all Channels at dot size  and I cant see the sun through it though light opacity isnt the key here its UV opacity and pigment inks block UV more completely then dye inks due to the goal of being archival quality. Never had an issue. My films are clean sharp and durable and I can still print pigment ink to heat transfers if someone needs a cheapo one off tee. The pigment ink washes well much better then I ever thought it would. Too bad heat transfer sheets still feel like a plastishield.edit Not really sure what the down vote was for.

9615437,0,t1_d9y9vmf,Yeah washing out under the biggest source of uv is not a good setup.  What would really help is to thoroughly wet both sides of your screen and just let it sit for a couple of minutes.  This allows the stencil area to absorb water swell and degrade.  This eases washout a lot.  ,SCREENPRINTING,d9yatq6,2,t5_2r7ky

9916112,0,t1_db02193,Thanks for the reply. I can set temp and time just fine I have it set to  but the display reads  and doesnt move up or down. I used a temp gun to see what it was at and according to that it stays around  degrees and wont go any higher.I didnt see anything in the manual about how to trouble shoot it  but Ill try what you recommended. I sent an email to Stahls today hopefully I can get it fixed.Thanks again!,SCREENPRINTING,db03dpe,1,t5_2r7ky

10768550,0,t3_5teaqn,Id definitely make sure your emulsion is drying properly. We typically let our screens sit for  hrs after being coated.  hours sometimes.... That doesnt say we havent coated one and had it dried with a heater and a fan within the hour but those arent ideal situations. Make sure your shopgarage doesnt have a lot of humidity and make sure your emulsion was mixed correctly..This surely can be a number of things so its hard to pin it down to just one solution.,SCREENPRINTING,ddqp2mw,1,t5_2r7ky

10807742,0,t1_ddlgirq,believe it or not but there are a lot of polyster inks on the market that still cure at  which to me is absolutely ridiculous and defeats the purpose of being a poly ink. Not sure why any company would make an ink specifically for polyester that cures anywhere near the sublimation temp of poly.   I use excaliburs  series and they cure at  and although they are expensive I couldnt see myself using anything else right now for performance garments except maybe silicone inks if I ever get around to them.  On another note a lot of Excaliburs regular plastisol inks actually recommend a .min dwell time at  which I couldnt even possible achieve with my conveyor has a belt speed setting but not temp control settings so I have a gallon of their PF plus white just sitting here wasting away.  even with a fan going at full speed Im pretty sure id set anything going through my dryer for .mins on fire!,SCREENPRINTING,dduqqte,1,t5_2r7ky
