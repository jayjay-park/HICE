1018328,0,t3_25nv9c,Hiya! Im a  yr old female. Im American. I have CMTx and I got it from my mom. My aunt and grandma have it as well although they are a bit strange about it.I wear braces for soccer but other than that Im not too bad off yet. Everything is slowly going down a bit. Im going to Iowa this summer to the CMT clinic. Thats where Doctor shy is may have heard of him from the CMTA program thing. Im just getting a baseline done for now but also signing up to get on a list to know about clinical trials since cmtx is significantly rarer. I havent met anyone that actually has cmt other than family but I had the weirdest experience the other day. I was grabbing dinner and waiting in line when this lady suddenly starts feeling up my calfankle. I was of course like wtf. She ended up apologizing but introduced herself. she was a very bold physical therapist and one of her patients has CMT. She saw the way I walked and thought she saw similarities. My muscles arent very weak yet or anything and very few people notice anything so it really caught me off guard.,CMT,chk1hlt,1,t5_2s82u
6629894,0,t1_czy0r3p,I cant speak for FumblesOfDisgamer but their point may have been that if you have a diagnosis of CMT as OP does if you have family members who have been diagnosed with a specific type ex. CMTA it is fairly likely you have the same type of them. unless by chance you have a spontaneous variant that results in a different type of CMTThis was the case for me. I had a significant family history of CMTA and so when I started showing symptoms my neurologist felt confident in giving me that diagnosis without doing further genetic testing.,CMT,d0536j6,2,t5_2s82u
7121218,0,t1_d1ncjjv,I totally agree! If the trend continues  might hopefully end up being an all time high! The sharp increase in articles after  is also really cool IMHO and it shows what a milestone it was to CMT research when the first disease causing mutation were pinpointed around this time. One of the things we could do with an collection of metadata on all the articles is to look at trends for different areas of research. For instance it could perhaps shed light on questions such as what is the majority of CMT research about? Is there basic or applied science being done on CMT? How is research divided in terms of CMT subtypes? Are there trends in terms of areas of research type of research etc? etc. etc. ,CMT,d1nlit2,1,t5_2s82u
8177040,0,t1_d4z4yno,Any streches youd recommend? I noticed that I am having slow progression on heavy lifts. This could be due to me just being fairly new but I wonder if CMT has any impact on the CNS that might make heavy low rep lifting hard?,CMT,d4zohfj,1,t5_2s82u
10766457,0,t3_5txlod,CMT severity is horrible to try to predict.  In my family  direct and first cousins  it has ranged from wheelchairs by  to unnoticeable until .  For some anesthesia seems to acerbate the symptoms yet for others it does not.That said in my family one seems to have either CMT or osteogenesis imperfecta.   For whatever reason they seem to be exclusive.May this help you.,CMT,ddqhauu,2,t5_2s82u
