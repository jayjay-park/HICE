The wounds of the past have long since healed but the scars that remain make them difficult to forget but still you should know that my people have great respect for the strength the Jedi have shown in battle.

5407479,0,t1_cw2so99,After hearing that description of the Rainbow Gem Sylana takes a deep breath an uncharacteristic look of surprise momentarily crossing her face. Chumeda I am not sure I am worthy of such a gift but I accept with the sincerest gratitude of my heart. I shall treasure this wonderful gift.Sylana paused for a moment holding the Gallinoran Rainbow Gem in her hands and admiring it. She felt great pride in the works that Serennon artisans could craft but this gem appeared to be a step above  likely a sign of the long maturation time the Chumeda had explained.She returned her attention to the other woman smiling warmly. Thank you Chumeda. I came here without a specific goal in mind which I doubt most of your visitors will be able to say. Plans and schemes are easy to come by especially on a world like Coruscant. Many people here are thinking first how they can use others to secure their own ambition. My only ulterior motive was intense curiosity your people after all are not well known outside your Consortium and so my desire was to meet with the person who would represent Hapes to the worlds outside her borders. My fervent hope was to find a kindred spirit and if I may be so bold to start forming the bonds of a genuine friendship.Sylana lightly ran the fingertips of one hand through the flowing water on the wall enjoying the feel of the water against her skin. Her smile turned sheepish. My apologies Chumeda. I do harbor another hope that a friendship might someday lead to an opportunity for me to visit Hapes. But it is not a hope that will inform my interactions with you since I know your people are often concerned about outsiders. ,galacticsenate,cw2v6gs,1,t5_37ifq
5422647,0,t1_cw4sfuy,Most recently I have been hoping to push for more open trade lanes and lowering taxes. Ultimately I hope it can lead not only to an increase in trade but an increase in the diversity of trade. Looking around the room Seldus took in the sheer number of species represented by the beings in this room.Culture is slowing in the Core. I hope to see new worlds join and add their cultures to the forefront of Core interests. Even longtime members of the Republic who havent had their due time in the cultural spotlight. So much potential for new ideas new developments. It could be a change that would strengthen the Republic permanently.,galacticsenate,cw4ssyb,2,t5_37ifq

5461910,0,t1_cw917b0,fraid Agamar has a few concerns oer this here proposal Bleiz said utterly ignorant of whether or not he even had permission to speak. And true to form he bulled on regardless. Yall spent a fair mount o time talkin about such lofty goals as oversight oer the Chancellors office or at least yon Vice Chair did but I aint convinced. Iffin these committee members are appointed by the Chancellor or the Vice Chair or whoever it be then how on earth are these members sposed to oversee the same? Iffin these committee members are supposed to provide oversight oer the Executive Office then why aint they appointed by this here body directly? I dont pretend to know how it works on other planets but over on Agamar but when we review that kinda thing  auditin we call it  the people doin the reviews aint answerable to the people who are bein reviewed. Me pappy the planetary governor contracts that out to folks who aint family and who aint answerable to him no matter how much he may trust his kith and kin cuz its important that the thinkins and pinions o these folks doin the oversight aint held hostage to the fact that they fectively owe their spots on the committee to that there Executive Office. Maybe yall do things diffrent here in the big city but where Im from we call what this bill outlines a conflict o interest.,galacticsenate,cw9t700,3,t5_37ifq

5630700,0,t3_3s88y5,Kith entered the room and bowed to the Hutts who sat before him. He could smell the hookah that one of them was smoking an aroma he missed since getting into the pirate business.Greetings exalted Representatives and thank you for meeting with me today. Allow me to introduce myself I am Kith Gastess leader of the Blood Jewels. I like yourselves am a man of business and opportunity. The opportunity I am interested in is an alliance with your glorious Empire you all work to uphold.Kith paced as he talked attempting to make the situation more casual Now I know what you must be thinking What use do we have for another gang?. Well The Blood Jewels are more than a gang we are a syndicate. We hail originally from Centares on the edge between the Mid and Outer Rims. Local law enforcement eventually caught onto our doings and to avoid the ending of our group or even the so so sovereign might of the Republic decided to form up and pursue other profitable options amongst the thousands of systems in the galaxy. We are more than capable of handling ourselves in a fire fight and Ive been with some of my men since my first years as a scoundrel. We can be of much use to beings of your caliber if youre interested.Meta ugeorgejrrtolkien unathanfr uthemallozzinator,galacticsenate,cwv1igy,1,t5_37ifq

5884892,0,t1_cxp7xna,M Sorry for some reason I didnt get the pingAnnius sat listening preferring to take measure of the situation and letting the VC speak. However it was now time to interject. He smiled at the innovation of the SBI. You have use your promotion well Director Alaroth I am impressed. I agree with your assessment although I do not share your optimism regarding the folding of New Dawn. Giving the Gungans rights will placate the more rational players in this game but not the fanatics. Annius raised a hand. I do not mean to belittle your idea. It is the best we can do. We cannot give in to the demands of terrorists but giving the Gungans rights is fair. It will sever much of New Dawns resources which will choke them. As for Trandoshia Annius frowned. The Senator wished to put forward a bill legalizing slavery. This should be made public. We should use this opportunity to become the Knights of Justice. On the surface we can announce that we are investigating the concern of slavery while your men and women hunt the radical New Dawn members. Annius glanced at the two in the room. What say you on this course of action? ,galacticsenate,cxr1jy8,2,t5_37ifq
