6648089,0,t1_d066xzt,At the moment I wrote this I was unrank. Now am I Challenger  and I feel like I can climb a little more too. Btw Im still shit at air rolling actually while my aerial skills have improved a lot I dont ever use the air roll like never and Id still love to improve at it since I think it could improve a lot my wall plays which are pretty bad right now and could help me learn aerial dribbling which Im not even close to. ,RocketLeagueSchool,d06yxle,1,t5_3997e
8961524,0,t1_d7ov8rg,im also trying to learn this. i think learning to freestyle is actually a good way to learn this because you basically force yourself to do the reverse.,RocketLeagueSchool,d7p1gsw,2,t5_3997e

10088455,0,t3_5k9vra,Just go into free play n fly upside down itll take quite a bit of time well at least for me it did. N when youre ok with knowing which way to turn do rookie aerial training to practice hitting the ball. ,RocketLeagueSchool,dbmjjws,1,t5_3997e
10664889,0,t3_5skoh4,It helps to have one or two if its been a long stressful day and Im already neartilt from traffic driving home and I keep driving too fast to dribble. More than that and its no an advantage.But in unranked its a blast. Im a drunken Snow Day player myself and I love deciding Screw dealing with those opponents on the field lets slide this puppy up the wall and across the ceiling! Its a surprisingly effective tactic due the nature of the puck and me playing in a matchmaking pool where air dribbles are rarely an occurrence.I cant air dribble either but drunk me sees that angle to hit it up and over straight at the goal for at least a hard clear and decent center while sober me never thinks of it.,RocketLeagueSchool,ddg0367,2,t5_3997e
