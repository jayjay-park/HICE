The Storer plans are very detailed with  pages of build instructions included that cover the entire build mast boom sail etc included.  I never found the time to build one but as a would be first time builder I didnt find any question unanswered.its been a while since I looked so drop the designer an email if youve got questions.  ,buildaboat,ck3gvtg,1,t5_2sz68

Its reported to handle well and it seems well designed. I want to build one myself. Iirc it was designed by an Australian. ,buildaboat,cn0glu0,1,t5_2sz68
