10642772,0,t1_dddk599,Well its a long topic and Im on mobile currently so I may update this later with a lengthier explanation but personally I think that the mantra of it being unsafe is way exaggerated and grounded in poorly done rice cars rather than genuine stance cars. First of all let me preface this by saying Ive been in  collisions none of which were my fault and the car handled both exceptionally well and with no extra damage from being low. My under carriage takes a beating but having done my car properly everything is armored with metal shields and thicker plastic parts in other areas so while those have some scrapes and dents the undercarriage itself subframe etc. is in very good shape besides a tiny bit of frame bending from one of the collisions so little that the insurance didnt even deem it a problem. One thing I would be willing to admit is that in one instance a SUV drove its underside onto my hood. The lady was texting so it wasnt a matter of not seeing me but at stock ride height she probably would have just hit me not slid onto my hood. That said miatas frss etc. also have equally low if not lower hoods so I dont think thats really a super relevant argument. I often hear the mantra that stance cars have a broken suspension but personally I think that stems from a lack of knowledge on the topic on a properly done car like mine youll see that most major parts such as control arms etc have been replaced with ones that are made of and also use bushings made of much superior materials with much higher stress ratings to accommodate for the redistribution of the cars symmetry. When it comes to camber I definitely wont lie that low and slow is pretty applicable in a sense but running much wider wheels than oem and with very high end tires not always the case for everyone sadly my stopping distances have actually improved! Handling wise I dont really push my car into corners but its definitely never had issues taking a turn either. Handles just fine because like I said the tires are so much wider and better that even though only day  touch the ground they still manage to gain good traction. Itll not an engineer by any means but Id say from observation that it evens out pretty well. I like to think of myself as pretty reasonable as a whole and as such always take as many measures as I can to make sure my stance car is appropriate all mods are done correctly and with appropriate parts etc. I sadly cant say thats the case for everyone or even the majority but if done correctly I really dont see it as being a huge issue personally. Also being from Florida where we dont have inspections Ive seen many stock cars in way worse condition that I personally would not take onto the streets because I just dont think theyre safe in any way shape or form. Also for what its worth I have a few mild performance mods and so on the highway for example I can step on it and get out of peoples ways trucks blindspots etc. plenty of pick up and go. Being lowered is definitely a lifestyle in many ways and also takes some considerations such as driving a certain way etc but I dont think Ive ever endangered anyone because of my car at least not more so than any other type of car. I know some states are more stringent than others and Florida is probably the most relaxed out there but as a whole Im quite sure if it was THAT dangerous wed see many more laws regarding it. And like you already pointed out I see lifted trucks and motorcycles as much more dangerous. Theyre likely to tip over much easier for example. But Im glad we can have a civil conversation about this and if you have more questions feel free to ask me bud! ,UserCars,dddpy15,6,t5_2su0p
