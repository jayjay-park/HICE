1388673,0,t1_ciqc60w,Yep thatll depend on the animals everyone can shoot. Its almost certainly going to be one of the deer and I think that each of the different varieties of deer have a map thats clearly best for them.I should also note that rather than polling forgt what kind of animals people on this subreddit can huntmaybe it should be what kind they WANT to hunt P,theHunter,ciqcolg,1,t5_2tx8d

10794056,0,t3_5udvk8,Is anyone else crashing as soon as you make it to the main menu?,theHunter,ddtbwfi,1,t5_2tx8d
10847868,0,t1_ddysdbh,Warning calls dont reduce your score. Score is determined by integrity how fast they die after you shot them and the size of trophy. ,theHunter,ddyvql9,1,t5_2tx8d
10880745,0,t1_de1rmei,i shot   trivial yesterday from m and got  score and got silver gold requires  score ,theHunter,de29saq,1,t5_2tx8d
10935794,0,t1_de2ijrc,A simple solution to this would be to use a key as a modifier. Like Hold Shift  Scroll to set walkrun speed. ,theHunter,de7y7zv,1,t5_2tx8d
10939095,0,t3_5w5mg2,Listen to the sound of the bushes. Its not the sound meter but the real sound that warns the animal. Crouching and crawling are the most stealthy. Also watch your scent it will warn the animals.,theHunter,de8ahd1,1,t5_2tx8d
10997569,0,t1_deejcoe,Its all about perspective. In the screenshot and in game they simulate your eye using the red dot as if it were a rifle scope you are entirely way too close which is why it is so big.,theHunter,deejh7o,3,t5_2tx8d
11093426,0,t1_denxrjw,Yeah my CPU is pretty poor but I guess this game is more GPU intensive of which mine is a gb gpu perhaps that matters? not sure. ,theHunter,depfhfw,1,t5_2tx8d
11115483,0,t1_derdxmj,I fixed it already theHunter wanted to play with my Intel Graphics card now everything runs on best options very highhigh and runs at    FPS.So I wouldnt say its mediocre ,theHunter,derxind,3,t5_2tx8d
11234455,0,t3_60btav,I just wut...? Bows are OP. The lbs has a nasty curve you need to learn but both bows pack a mighty punch. The lbs with gr arrows downed a bison at m for me in one shot. Thats something my . hasnt managed yet. And if you hoot the caller right after shooting your target if missed or his buddies will circle right around so you can try again.,theHunter,df5erv8,3,t5_2tx8d
11299648,0,t1_dfcdvr2,That was absolutely the issue. Thank you haha,theHunter,dfcsqz5,1,t5_2tx8d
11391673,0,t1_dfn4zn9,Again my arguement is not why we dont have an exit to menu button it is the fact that when the community asked where it was we were quietened down with a promise that the fix was imminent. This was in fact a lie as the fix has never come and after that lie the team have refused to even acknowledge that lie ever existed or address the original issue any more at all.The content of the game is not being questioned here the integrity of the team they have employed to keep the community informed of the progress of the game is. Their lying ignoring and covering up of their lies are what I find unacceptable and trying to bring attention to here please do not divert the argument to specifics of the game itself either way.The one thing I am willing to accept is that you just need to be a little patient. I am not above admitting that if nobody else is agreeing with me then I may be jumping the gun and the standards I hold might be higher than a lot of others and I may need to lower them. Thankyou for the calm critique of my opinion.,theHunter,dfn89dw,1,t5_2tx8d
11391700,0,t1_dfn8ar5,Again no evidence of any of the personal attacks or breaking the forum rules which you are accusing me of either. If I am guilty of anything it seems to have been a race to the bottom which you have gladly joined in on rather than to rise above.Selective part of the overall thread? That is the whole thread in its entirety which was deleted by yourself. I think you have also done a pretty good job of proving my point to anyone else who agrees with my opinion.Thanks for your reply.,theHunter,dfn8ddo,-1,t5_2tx8d
11444326,0,t3_63bdrp,There is a setting for this somewhere under gameplay maybe?. Its set to x by default.,theHunter,dft7cvo,1,t5_2tx8d
11459954,0,t1_dfuxpz8,Weird Ive no problem at all in fact I have slightly more FPS than beforeDo you use custom settings in nVidiaAMD control panel especially AntialiasingTransparency? Ive read that those were causing issues since last patch,theHunter,dfuz8al,2,t5_2tx8d
11472879,0,t3_63r8wn,deleted,theHunter,dfwg22q,1,t5_2tx8d
11636901,0,t1_dgez6mk,Yes but these other games dont need me to directly activate offline mode on my Steam when connection is lost the game enters in its own offline mode and depending on the game I can continue or it kicks me to the main menu if I was actively using online functionalities. Stats tracking and cloud saving do not count to this matter.This game just goes black screen with a popup and it closes the game completely when in Singleplayer its poorly handled.,theHunter,dgf20iq,3,t5_2tx8d
