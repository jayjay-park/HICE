3678843,0,t1_cqbk9jl,gt I was a little saddened about the lack of awarenessSame here BlindGuardian also nice name. I feel like there is a possible solution such as hearing aid for the deaf. Maybe Google Glasses will allow us to somehow view the world without the grain effect.For now I will call myself a snowman. I need to make my visual disorder fun somehow. lol,visualsnow,cqbm212,2,t5_2sjlm

7851006,0,t1_d3yiolv,Could be. Do you have tinnitus as well? Tinnitus and visual snow are both connected in the brain somehow. I got T which might have been a connecting dot for the onset of my VS. Who knows...,visualsnow,d3yiu8m,1,t5_2sjlm
8366300,0,t3_4u5upv,It cant hurt. I have almost lost faith in doctors myself though. They simply wont say that they dont know what is wrong with you. Either there is nothing wrong with you you are being too picky or you should see a shrink. One neurologist will prescribe some epilepsy drug to me soon though lets see how that will work out...,visualsnow,d5nc7ix,2,t5_2sjlm

10752018,0,t3_5tts8g,This is interesting. ALL of this affects me except the ear volume thing and the physical ones. I do seem to have hyperacusis.  I actually fly into an uncontrollable rage when I hear some sounds.  And theres also a subset of music that causes this weird rushing sensation in my brain kind of like both internal and external ASMR.  My boyfriend and I pulled a few songs that cause it into Protools and analyzed them and they all fell within the same hertz range and were chorused but I dont remember what.  This part of this Sting song is an example of the types of songs that cause this. I definitely have tinnitus both things I have had as far as I remember and some that is definitely caused by hearing damage from idiocy where I should have been wearing earplugs. I had no issues that could be recorded with my hearing as a kid.  I also have issues with background noise and conversation.  Have always had this as well.  If there is a lot of background noise but someone is talking to me even if theyre right in front of me I cant understand them.All the visual symptoms he described. There. Not related to actual eye damage I am nearsighted and every time I bring it to to my ophthalmologist theres worry about my retinas.  It wasnt. These have mostly always been there. I actually also get migraine with aura too.I do meditate.  I already actually listened to pink noise which is apparently a therapy for hyperacusis.  And Tomatis tones as well.  I use an app called Get High Now that has pseudoTomatis tones various noise frequencies and binaural beats that Ive used for a few years that seem to help me in terms of destressing.  So weird!,visualsnow,ddozl8v,2,t5_2sjlm

11249043,0,t1_df70wiz,For me not really.  Its just always been there so I guess its actually kind of intense but I dont know how to see any other way and it gets a little worse around my migraines.  The older I get the more I think that maybe my brain has some weird disconnects.  Ill talk to people about things like my reactions to sounds or smells or flavors or the fact that I have flashbacks to ultra specific and kind of mundane memories in picture perfect clarity and its clear at least now that its not really within the spectrum of normal.  So I think something is wrong with my brain somehow.  Drugs dont make it worse but they dont make it better.  Caffeine makes me not notice it. For me at least its just kind of a weird curiosity. If I notice something moving out of the corner of my eye I need to assess if it was really there mostly I just think I see my cat all the time that kind of thing.,visualsnow,df729eu,1,t5_2sjlm
