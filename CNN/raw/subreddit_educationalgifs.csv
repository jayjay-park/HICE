1213051,0,t1_ci616i6,I was simply bringing attention to Gibbs phenomenon and the problem that this indicates for using a Fourier series to approximate discontinuous functions. Now arguing that Gibbs phenomenon does not manifest when you have an infinite number of terms is a delicate thing that requires us to talk much more precisely than either of our previous comments have done. Things might not be as simple as you let on in your comment. In particular from the Gibbs wikigtAs can be seen as the number of terms rises the error of the approximation is reduced in width and energy but converges to a fixed height.So the height of the Gibbs overshoot never goes away even in the limit of infinite terms. You will tell me But DrGar the proofs of the Fourier Expansion tell me that this infinite sum of harmonics must converge to the square wave? And I will say right you are. But which kind of convergence LordGravewish? You see it most certainly has pointwise convergence but it does not converge absolutely. In particular the convergence of Fourier series is a quite extensive topic so one should not confuse matters by thinking an infinite number of terms saves you from all troubles. Edit As a tldr Yes I am saying that the Gibbs phenomena is present even in the limit of infinite number of terms. Depending on what notion of convergence you wish to discuss the Gibbs phenomena does or does not break convergence to the square wave.,educationalgifs,ci634j5,1,t5_2w708

1940370,0,t1_ckmqrno,Not... really. The fixed velocity is not a real constant number it is a Gaussian peak a fairly narrow one around an average. The reason for narrowness of the peak is that most of the time is spend on the release conformational change and binding steps. The search step is fairly brief and all of the chaotic movement variance is contained within it. In other words while it is a fairly small component of the time factor in the final velocity measurement the chaotic step is  well chaotic. ,educationalgifs,ckn0dpt,1,t5_2w708

2016539,0,t1_ckw1uxg,Ok its a complicated subject but i will try.Now in general Fourier Transforms are a way to use sine waves to describe arbitrary signals. In Ops example sines waves are used to describe a square wave. Thats actually not a very good use of FTs because of those distortions that show up however signals in real life are well described by sine waves because such sine waves show up everywhere in nature! Take a look at sound sound is just air pressure waves that your ears can detect your hair follicles actually perform a kind of biological Fourier Transform!. So now you know there are lots of waves in nature how would you go about working with these waves? These are signals that have lots of oscillations and repetition. Now you could try and describe them using a polynomial formula but you will soon find yourself overwhelmed by how hard it is to actually characterize real signals this way in particular polynomials are bad with repetition. But we know that Fourier Tranforms can describe arbitrary signals and it turns out you can describe FTs using just an array of amplitude frequency and phase technically descrete Fourier Transforms because real shit is finite. Using Ops gif as an example the FT can be written as something like Amplitude pipipipi Frequency  and Phase. This tyoe of notation known as the frequency domain is actually really good at describing all kinds of signals and its simply easier to work with for both humans and computers. Ok now that we have this neat little frequency domain system that can describe real signals what are some magical things we can do? Lets take audio transmission as an example. Now microphones can record sound at audio frequencies of about Hz and convert these into electrical signals. If you ever looked at a those spectrum graphs Winamp generates that what its showing amplitude vs frequency of the sound currently being generated. Now we can send this signal through a wire an probably pick it up with another wire a foot away but it will probably suck because electromagnetic signals dont really transmit well at  Hz. However electromagnetic waves do really well transmitting over long distances in the Hz range. What can we do then? Well we can generate a Mhz wave and multiply it with the audio signsl. Now if you were going to describe this phenomenon using a polynomial... Well thats practically impossible. But using the frequency domain what this will look like is you now have a signal between   Hz I left out some details but the audio signal has essentially shifted by Mhz. Now we can build awesome antennas and transmit this for miles! On the recieving end you divide the signal by Mhz and what you get? The original audio signal back! And thats FM radio which is much easier to understand using Fourier Transforms and the frequency domain.This is just one of many many applications. Hopefully i explained it with some clarity.,educationalgifs,ckw6twm,13,t5_2w708

If the round fails to fire it is ejected in the same way as a spent casing.The more problematic misfire for this type of weapon system belt fed is a failure to feed usually caused by misaligned ammunition due to transport. The M has a system in place before the linked rounds are fed into the belt that fixes this issue.

4128226,0,t3_37uwhh,The big factor in addition to the increased firepower is that getting the range right is more problematic than getting the side to side aim right.  When you fire a round with a high parabolic arc against a target that you are aiming down lengthways you are much more likely to score a hit than if the target is facing you broadsidethe shot will either fall short or long because the beam is much shorter than the length.  Crossing the T at Jutland in  was critical because of this principle. In Nelsons day cannon fire was all smooth bore and only effective at short rangeso crossing the T in  was just about the firepower advantage.,educationalgifs,crqubr2,1,t5_2w708

Thats why there are dots in wave patterns on the second screen. The dots result from the collapse of the wave function caused by interaction with the atoms on the screen. The screen is thus the observer. The wave pattern happens because those particular photons have not had their wave patterns collapse on the first screen with the slots there are a lot more dots on there thus they continued to behave according to their wavefunction with the interference until they hit the second screen.,educationalgifs,cyjgt16,2,t5_2w708

I opened the lid for another slice and I saw three of those fuckers run for cover.... Yes I kept eating it I didnt feel like going hungry that night and I wasnt going to let those little fucking urban terrorists ruin my feast.Also I once I killed a pregnant one.  A very pregnant one in my sink.  At least twelve mini fuckers spawned from that swat.  My friend it was whackamole time.  Never actually thought that game would pay off till then.Eventually several years down the line the guy who was hosting the colony as well as an unknown number of cats bombed his place.  Oh you should have seen those meaty little sphincter suckers scatter.  They were on his window on the inside trying so fucking hard to get out you could practically hear them screaming bloody murder.  They were running from the entire building across a fresh black top parking lot in midday full summer sun.  Die you fucking parasites fucking die.The kicker was they never not once helped pay rent.To address it before its brought up I couldnt afford to move yet and after a while I was able to combat their presence in my pad to a tolerable level through multiple and creative methods so even when it was an option I didnt rush.

7145420,0,t1_d1qc73m,You just fine! I enjoy when people ask me questions about it. Yes i had both my legs amputated below the knee in the summer of . I had them done one at a time so for a few months I had one prosthetic and one sound limb. It is actually harder with both as prosthetics because they dont adapt. With any amputation there is limb volume change througout the day. What I mean by that is my stumps change size as the day goes on and usually it happens at different rates. As the sockets are rigid I have socks that are different thicknesses to make up the volume change. With one amputation you only have one leg to worry about when it comes to volume change. It is easier with both amputated in my case because my legs didnt work well before hand so I tend to foxus on the positives of it all. You were absolutely not offensive  I speak in front of Elementary school children and they have no filters between their brain and their mouth so I got used to questions real quick. If theres anything else youre wondering about Ill do my best to answer.Thanks for giving me my first Reddit Gold!,educationalgifs,d1qcxt2,114,t5_2w708

Here is Figure  from that NOAA paper which in a shows the difference between the new NOAA adjustments and previous homogenization and b the difference between the new NOAA adjustments and raw surface temperature data. The entire fuss is being made over the incredibly slight difference between the two lines over the last twenty years in a. Second a new paper just came out last month Hausfather et al.  that confirmed the minor adjustments from Karl et al.  were accurate through several different lines of evidence buoys Argo floats and satellites. You can read these scientists AMA here From the abstractgtSea surface temperature SST records are subject to potential biases due to changing instrumentation and measurement practices. Significant differences exist between commonly used composite SST reconstructions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Extended Reconstruction Sea Surface Temperature ERSST the Hadley Centre SST data set HadSST and the Japanese Meteorological Agencys Centennial ObservationBased Estimates of SSTs COBESST from  to the present. The update from ERSST version b to version  resulted in an increase in the operational SST trend estimate during the last  years from . to .C per decade indicating a higher rate of warming in recent years. We show that ERSST version  trends generally agree with largely independent nearglobal and instrumentally homogeneous SST measurements from floating buoys Argo floats and radiometerbased satellite measurements that have been developed and deployed during the past two decades. We find a large cooling bias in ERSST version b and smaller but significant cooling biases in HadSST and COBESST from  to the present with respect to most series examined. These results suggest that reported rates of SST warming in recent years have been underestimated in these three data sets.,educationalgifs,ddel75r,1,t5_2w708

11371241,0,t1_dfkurdy,I can imagine some kind of automation might exist for some kind of process but at least in regards to the single hysto I watched it played no part in the matter. I only have that as a sample size of a singular type of surgery and a singular instance of it I watched though. Probably not the hysto I had either but who knows I was knocked out during it.But yeah definitely theyre pretty much the same fears I had before having needed to research it.  Something thats probably gonna be on everyones minds untilif these kinda machines become like very commonly used and old news. I guess kinda similar to people not trusting automated cars once theyre actually a legit consumer thing in the not too far future even though statistically theyre better. Or planes when air travel is far safer than car travel. The idea of a human not being truly in control of what happens is scary no matter if thats accurate or not. The biggest issue I have with them is if theyre cost effective which I didnt look too far into after my research prior to surgery.  But I just got an idea of them being expensive as hell and maybe not being worth it for most surgeries that can be performed with similar results alternatively. For the stuff where the alternative means are horrible stuff and a hard surgery though its nice to have access to them and maybe you might as well do some surgeries like hystos with them too. Huh. Only just realized that part to be honest while typing this. Complex issue Im glad I dont have to deal with at any rate.,educationalgifs,dfkwqfm,2,t5_2w708

11508838,0,t1_dg0hr71,Im fed up with the idiot bleeding hearts that have been on Reddit recently. Their ideals are baffling. We cant hurt animals they feel pain. What is pain? A response to stimuli that possibly threatens the organism. Guess what else feels pain then? plants Insects etc. By their own reasoning eating plants is just as bad as an animal. Yet they dont feel that way since it doesnt have the cute little sad eyes for them to get upset over. Some will argue well they arent intellegent life. Well were do you place that cut off at what is intelligence? Because since when is a fucking frog intelligent? Here is a good basis is it human? No? Cool then it doesnt fucking matter. Sure some idiots like to throw around what about aliens? Which is idiotic because guess what? There arent any? Maybe one day loooong down the line that will be a concern but until then that is like saying what about dragons and fairies? All of the arguments the idiots dish out are meaningless and typically hypocritical and if they took two seconds to get past their bleed hearts they would see that. ,educationalgifs,dg0j143,-2,t5_2w708

After Reconstruction ended the South was primarily conservative Democratic sort of like a rd party but after LBJ and the civil rights movement party realignment changed party affiliation with the Republicansconservative party primarily the reason so many Republicans call themselves Conservatives  dominating the South with the more Liberal states becoming Democratic.
