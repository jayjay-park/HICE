Now before everyone jumps down my throat that the fed also manipulates currency its a central instituition thats doing it.  If everyone could willy nilly manipulate the dollar it would have no real value.  Again before everyone jumps down my throat that the dollar has no real value it does.  It does because its linked to oil.  It does because it has a track record of a couple hundred years.  If bitcoins couldnt be hacked in an instant manipulated in a day etc they would be ok.

Would still probably apply though.This part was interesting  It is not the lack or presence of one or more factors that will determine whether a transaction is on capital or income account it is the combined force of all of the factors that is important. There is no magic formula to determine which factors are more or less important. Some factors complement each other. Each case is different. A judge must balance all the factors.They call it an adventure in trade. heh.  I also wonder if you had the unfortunate luck of them coming after you would you get a reset on your tfsa contribution?

9809185,0,t1_dam5m01,I would also say to be cautious of this argument. It is anecdotal at best. Comparing the balance sheets of Canopy and MJN is dangerous as they operate in completely different formats so take that part with a grain of sand. I have not looked far enough into their financials to provide insight into their potential. There is a lot of hyperbole in this analysis which is a big turn off. For future reference when you are deciding whether or not to take someones financial advice be wary of the metrics they use to justify their argument. EPS PE Marketcap surely important but relying on these metrics alone can be problematic.ROIC is an important metric that I would consider looking at this is the return on invested capital. essentially It indicates how well the management is deploying their capital and illustrates the ability for the company to make money from operations.   EG.Over  years Company A has seen a  growth in their EPS Company B has seen  growth in their EPS Company A has an ROIC of  while company B has an ROIC of . Company As value has increased  while company B has increased only . This is because EPS alone does not determine the ability for a company to create value for its share holders. If both companies had the same ROIC then you could use EPS to compare them. Not sure what encouraged me to go on and on but I feel that this good information and largely overlooked. ,weedstocks,dam6xgs,4,t5_2zfqj

10364972,0,t1_dciwgwi,But all that is being worked on right now thats what the Task Force was looking at. Just to counter your points Hazards with Alcohol  Not any more hazardous than other legal medications or over the counter drugs plus its recommended that it not be sold where alcohol is sold.Advertising and Children No products will be marketed to appeal towards Children especially edibles or marijuana cigarettes. That said Marijuana is closer to Alcohol than Tobacco and should be allowed to advertise in a similar fashion otherwise theres a double standard and that isnt right. Theyve also recommended more plain packaging or as I interpreted it less flashy. DrivingMachinery You can already get impaired charges which are the same as Alcohol. Until further review and testing advances It will be treated like Drug Impairment. If you drive dangerously or crash and an officer suspects impairment they can charge you and send you for blood tests. Even if Marijuana highness cant be measured like BAC for drinking they can still nail you for dangerous or wreckless driving and that is big points that or theyll have to catch you red handed with a car full of smoke or a joint in hand. Taxation I think rec will be taxed higher than med the only question is at what rate and that is something that can be worked out a lot easier than other issues. The recall thing is another issue but maybe HC is being more lenient right now because these big LPs are just getting started and they might need a little time before the machine is pumping out harvest after harvest. I think they should be treated like any consumable product and its in the interest of the companies to be honest and open about any recalls. They should be treated no different than alcohol or produce and as far as harfmul pesticides the companies integrity has a lot at stake especially this early in the game so its in their best interest to keep things on the level...,weedstocks,dcixjs7,1,t5_2zfqj

I can buy coffee for  of the price but I choose not to. Both my fav coffee and cheap dollar store coffee meet regulations of canada.

Last week Bruce Linton said he will build in Germany as soon as humanly possible.  They purchased a German medical distributer late  in order to supply the market.  Germany lawmakers have visited Canopy several times last year looking for help with building a legal framework.  Bedrocan also had a division in Brazil and soon Australia.  The Goldman group had locked up over  prime retail location that will require no money upfront for cgc and they are just starting.    I have lost track of how many clinics they own.  And how many companies they own.Bill Gates started his business wanting his software in every computer in the world and every action sprung from that point of view.

Also if rec fails canopy is by far the least safe play because these companies are all already priced for recreational to a large degree and theres no justification in current valuations is youre calculating intrinsic value based on medicinal revenues.

11004090,0,t3_5x4rc6,Noticed theres two of the same threads but I posted this in the other thread. There was confusion as to whether this was an audit. The OSCs job is to regulate and to ensure that the financial statements are properly presented. This is completely different than an audit. An audit involves providing assurance on a companys numbers and controls. If you read the article it clearly states that no numbers have changed. It mentions that the things that have been updated for example is that the statements need to include comparables to prior periods which they were previously lacking. Off topic but I think this needs to be addressed. I am an auditor by trade and I am curious as to why it is being assumed that audits are bad? It is the results of that audit that are most important. If an audit shows that that company is air tight with its controls and spot on with its numbers that would prove to be very good news and would give investors confidence in the company. Audits are performed more frequently than you think especially for public companies. For example banks will often require an audit be performed if a company is looking to obtain significant financing.           ,weedstocks,defa63t,12,t5_2zfqj

11236417,0,t3_601ixl,Please be aware shortdata.ca tells you the volume of shorts traded which includes shorts that have been covered. That isnt the number of shares currently short. To calculate the number of shares being shorted take the Value of current shorts and divide it by the share price on the date of the report. That will give you the number of shares. Its much less than the volume. For ACB the short value is usually around  million. So approx  shares at todays PPS.EMC has a huge short volume in the report OP linked to which could mean lots of shorts jumped on and then covered.

11474263,0,t3_63sjpw,At least three provinces are making it clear they expect Ottawa to foot the bill for costs associated with its plan to legalize marijuana  an issue that will have significant impacts in their jurisdictions.In Edmonton on Wednesday Alberta Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley said there likely be additional financial pressures related to regulation testing and sharing public information about a legalized regime.We certainly are expecting some help with that  in what form that comes is difficult to say without having seen the regulations she said.The government is expected to introduce legislation as soon as next week ahead of annual Weed Day celebrations on April  to regulate the use of marijuana.Manitoba Justice Minister Heather Stefanson said Wednesday the province told a federally appointed task force that legalizing marijuana would create new demands on police.Ottawa will need to provide provinces and territories with sufficient financial resources to support law enforcement particularly in the area of training and equipment to deal with impaired drivers she added.They will also need to provide sufficient resources for inspectors to ensure compliance with marijuana production and storage regulations rather than trying to rely on police resources for inspections Stefanson said in a statement.Late last month Saskatchewan also issued a statement saying it is concerned about public safety and significant increases in enforcement costs  a tab it doesnt plan to pay itself.In an interview Wednesday Bill Blair former Toronto police chief and now parliamentary secretary to Justice Minister Jody WilsonRaybould said the federal government recognizes and respects the role of the provinces in the legalization of marijuana.We know that the provinces will have a very significant role particularly in managing the retail environment and the consumption regulations Blair said. In order to do that effectively they are going to need to have resources for the administration and enforcement ... and so thats part of an important discussion that will take place between the federal government and the provinces.Police are also concerned about training and demands under a legalized regime.The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police is also urging the federal government to financially support officers seeking to become qualified drug recognition experts says president Mario Harel.Driving under the influence of marijuana is already a situation we are facing now but we believe it is going to enhance the problem once it is legalized he said in an interview. We really need to train more experts.He said there now are about  such experts across the country and the need is estimated at about .Field certification training is offered in the United States Harel said but it should also be available in Canada.Blair stressed that the federal government is committed to ensuring that police and courts have technology training and resources to keep roads safe.It is not just a matter of passing legislation we need to make sure that our police officers have the technology they need to be able to detect and gather evidence for this offence he said.We also know they need more training. ... We need a madeinCanada training program that is accessible to all police services and available in both official languages.Police chiefs also want the Liberal government to exclude personal cultivation from its plans to legalize marijuana Harel said.The task force on legalization recommended allowing people to cultivate up to four marijuana plants for personal use but Harel said enforcing such limits can be very difficult.Harel who is expected to testify Thursday before the Senates legal and constitutional affairs committee said its impossible to ensure such pot isnt being cultivated for the black market.The association says the dangers of growops have long been clear and that allowing home cultivation would make it impossible to control THC levels pesticide use and perils such as mould.In the Commons on Wednesday Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said marijuana will remain illegal until a new framework protects young people and prevents criminals from profiting.
