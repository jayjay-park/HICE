2320663,0,t1_clyb5jg,Thanks for the response.  I hadnt considered the fluoride issue in the context of the microbiota in my field the chlorine products are what are used as actives in antimicrobials.  Perhaps the fluoride issue is more to do with its effects on the rest of the body?Similar to SurferLifes post is supplementation necessary if I have an adequate diet?  I know that there are minerals galore in plants and chlorophyll plus I dont want to add additional costs if I am going to filter this water.  I dont mind the taste of filtered water either.Good tip on the refluorinated though didnt know there was such an offering!,Microbiome,clyjqfr,2,t5_2x8bh

5349174,0,t1_cvumiui,Unfortunately thats where the research has hit a wall or so it seems to me  I may have overlooked something. Clinical data on fermented food diets in which the microbial food content was analyzed or better yet controlled would be great but its unclear who would fund such an endeavor.,Microbiome,cvvf15l,2,t5_2x8bh
5765553,0,t3_3u31dw,You cant best as I know.You want a coating that survives low pH but dissolves in the higher pH of the duodenum. Enteric coatings have become very sophisticated including a number of compounds like polyvinyl acetate phthalate and methyl methacrylatemethacrylic acid copolymers but the quickanddirty method is to use shellac. Confectioners glaze is available as a foodgrade product online and would probably work to make your own entericcoated capsules.,Microbiome,cxbrqak,1,t5_2x8bh

6146615,0,t1_cyo8k9v,I will disagree with this that you are cutting a large swath in saying we dont know what and ideal biome looks like.  We dont have it to many decimals so to speak but we do have a ballpark.For example high diversity simpsom score has been associated with health.  Also some bacteria dominate those with inflammatory conditions.I think its worth getting the test done with ubiome and seeing how your results compare to others especially wrt diversity.  You can always take a probiotic or prebiotic to increase diversity.,Microbiome,cyob0e9,5,t5_2x8bh

6786129,0,t1_d0lh8qz,Shy of another fecal transplant I doubt there is another way to replenish the clostridia spore forming serotonin bacteria.  If you check this case study the patient had a  increase in Clostridium cluster XIVa after FMT.Source Scratch that... you may be able to increase Clostridium cluster XIVa by consuming chitinglucan fiber or Fungal GG.

7571236,0,t1_d323btl,I have plenty of VSL  at home.I wonder if its really do to probiotics or maybe some prebiotics she is supplementing in her diet. Also what about her appendix? Maybe something in her lifestyle triggered the bacteria covered in biofilms to release from her appendix thats why those strains showed up in the stool.Until we can see the whole picture the microbiome science is really pretty elementary. ,Microbiome,d32t9i3,1,t5_2x8bh
7736961,0,t1_d3l6k0v,The microbiota is actually quite resilient and generally returns to the preantibiotics state on its own. Taking a probiotic or eating yogurt or other fermented foods might help but theres no evidence of that yet. ,Microbiome,d3lmx5j,1,t5_2x8bh

More like your health background and how you found yourself being in this position what sort of diet and lifestyle you have and what extent you have gone to see why you make a valuable donor.I am just curious. Cause I understand people in need. So I am curious to how someone in a giving position comes to encounter these sorts of things.

9131697,0,t1_d895tpp,Negative. It could only be true if everyone had the same microbes in their gut which isnt the case. There are many things which can cause certain microbes to be wiped out such as antibiotics possibly a phage etc..If it were true then eating healthy could cure everything the gut microbiome is currently implicated in which again does not happen.,Microbiome,d89ib35,1,t5_2x8bh

Here are some articles about it  this guy does a bunch of extreme amp unnecessary stuff though. ,Microbiome,d9txbgw,1,t5_2x8bh
9626504,0,t1_d9z4wah,I study the microbiota for a living.... yes i saw  them and if you read my comment you would realise I acknowledged them. Youve collected a handful of studies which suit your narrative. Human studies are much harder to control for than animal studies in this case as it is much more difficult to find infants who havent received antibiotics. This subreddit is starting to annoy me and is turning my profession into what is essentially homeopathy albeit with at least some evidence to back it up. I dont want to see my field become the next nutritional science where every member of the public seems to think they have a PhD in it. People are already scamming people with bs products which restore a healthy microbiota Dont get me wrong its great that youre knowledgeable about the microbiota and its effects your health thats important and useful to know but theres an obvious bias and lack of critical review. ,Microbiome,d9znxyr,2,t5_2x8bh
9937909,0,t3_5hrjqb,... you asked this same question  year ago uisaacgerg has and I think utestingtestingibs has as well. Its not especially useful in my opinion though since studies have shown that even if the probiotic cant be detected in the stool it can still assert affects higher up in the digestive tract before it disappears. ,Microbiome,db2xnyv,3,t5_2x8bh
10002089,0,t1_db9ilpi,Explaining myself is very complicated but there have only been three major shifts Learning that carbohydrates were important for gut bacteria. I had previously thought that all carbohydrates are harmful because the body itself doesnt need them and carbohydrates sugar tend to be the root of most disease in industrialized society obesity diabetes etc. Learning that resistant starches produce more butyrate than fructans inulin resulting in a minor inclusion  of power. Learning that intact plant cells are needed to prevent erosion of mucus lining.Other than that I hate details and I dont like allowing studies to have too much influence over my behavior.Tracking grams or percentage points would drive me crazy and also doesnt necessarily carry any meaning at all.Bacterial diversity and consistency in action does however ensure meaning and actuality.Organization is part of the longer and bigger plan but organization is so energy intensive and needs to be  even  disorganization leads to a system you cant have faith in.,Microbiome,dbbau9l,2,t5_2x8bh
10014670,0,t1_dbcbssw,The bacteria in fermented foods will not colonize the human gut as they are the wrong nonnative strains.

Why not just alter your diet and test weekly to find out what works.Yeah I know the study but Ive tried every dietary modification possible. The testing would be very expensive and probably unnecessary since Id be able to tell what was working via fatigue improvements.gt Has openBiomes repo not been good enough for you?They only provide stool for C.diff unfortunately.

I think there are good benefits to occasional consumption of actual starch I am not sure what they might be just in terms of how I feel. Not every day but having some pasta or something once in a while is definitely something I personally want to do.
