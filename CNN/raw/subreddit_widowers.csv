I dont know that Ill ever be without guilt... it manages to appear in most of my happy moments though it doesnt quite have the same bite it used to.I agree completely about it depending on who youre with! My boyfriend still such a foreign term having been married for seven years! was the right person at the right time. He does not compete with my late husband. He understands the need my kids and I have to talk about my husband and the awful days that still happen. Had it not been for him I dont think I would have deemed myself ready. ,widowers,cjnujkn,2,t5_2swuk

Im sorry that youre with us.We didnt have children and so I dont even come close to understanding the peculiarities of dealing with a child losing a parent on TOP of someone losing a spouse.I will say this  No you do not exist solely for your child.  And yes you DO get another chance.  Whether you decide to become ready for it its too early for you right at the moment is up to you.  Its ok if youre not too.The construct of life and pain and death?  I wish I had those answers.  We all do.  My counselor doesnt and my priest doesnt so I give up on that stuff.Remember how lovable you are.  Remember how much he loved youwhich means that youre lovable.

5084164,0,t1_cuyopux,It didnt feel good at first but over time Ive gained more emotional stability though of course I still cry. I realized I was using video games as an escape and distraction and I would binge on them late at night. After a while it seemed like I was pushing away feelings and thoughts that I should be experiencing in order to properly grieve. Everyone is different of course but I have a tendency to take my interests to the extreme so I had to force myself to shift my interests to things that I thought would be more productive to me in the long run. For example I could play DOTA for  or  hours a night but I would wake up feeling empty. When I spend  hours improving my pool game or hiking to the top of a mountain I feel like I gain something longlasting.Edit Sorry I didnt really answer your question... it makes me feel a lot closer to her. Which sometimes makes me cry and sometimes makes me smile knowing she would give me a high five for exploring outside my comfort zone. Edit I should also mention that it took me about  months to have this realization. Prior to this I drank a lot of whiskey and smoked a lot of pot. I still enjoy whiskey and I grow pot for medical patients like I did for my wife during chemotherapy but I dont use either as a tool to blanket my thoughts and feelings anymore. Sorry for all the edits hah. You mentioned the idea of waiting until things get better. Dont ever wait for anything. Things in our lives will only shift when we initiate change nothing will ever happen for us. If we were to wait for a time to feel better without a catalyst we would wait forever and Im sure some people do. Best if luck and much love to you.

Im  and I feel the same way that I will never find someone who loves me the way he did. I wont comment on whether thats likely or not the bottom line is that it isnt something you should focus on at the moment. You are feeling lonely and feel the void which is natural. Anger and fear are part of the process let yourself go through this and embrace it. I know it seems far fetched right now but soon enough you will be feeling guilty at not missing him as much and feeling things for someone else. Enjoy your fear and anger right now let it remind you of how you had something in life a lot of people never enjoy. Dont rush your emotions dont rush your life.

7212394,0,t1_d1xilkr,I just spent some time thinking about the things that I wanted before we met and compared them with what I was doing. My biggest move was selling my house. I had a big house in the burbs. It was a good family hosue and I kept telling myself I liked having a nice house. In the end though it was never the sort of thing I wanted before I met my wife. Now I have a small place close in to the urban core. She would have hated it I love it. Short commute better food etc. I occasionally miss my huge yard or finished basement play room for my kid but in the end it gets me out to the parks or community center more often that thats the way I prefer it for my own reasons.,widowers,d1xzre6,2,t5_2swuk

Yet they felt the need to check up on him constantly judge his every move make sure he had enough money and even went so far as to make sure he was or wasnt having sex. This depended on who was checking up on him.After we met this behavior annoyed me to the point where he realized how demeaning it was. He avoided them most of the time. It took years before he trusted them with any personal information again. And theyand his friendsthought he started dating way too soon.  months.

8855181,0,t3_51ic1f,I am so sorry this is so hard. You are not punished. You are in a huge amount of pain a world of pain. The good thing and the terrible thing is that pain does not kill you. It just hurts and hurts and makes time go slow so you can feel it hurting for longer.At first you can only lie in bed and sob and hurt. After youre cried out you can sit and breathe and hurt. Then you can stare out the window and hurt watch TV and hurt. Chew your food swallow and hurt. Do the dishes and hurt. Hurt trying to fall asleep and in the morning as soon as you wake up and remember start hurting again. Hurt walking to meet a friend and hurt telling them how much it hurts.You feel the agony of the things that are there and not there the uninhabited clothes the undented pillow on the other side of the bed all the old places you once were together and the new places you never will be. Happy couples holding hands in some parallel universe you can see but arent a part of any more. Little triggers firecracker surprises of pain pet names injokes routines. Even toiletries fastfood restaurants hairpins the tiniest stupidest things are like knives in you. But they dont draw blood thankfully horribly you will survive them again and again.It will be like this for some time. It seems like it will never get better because the person who could make it all better is gone and cant come back. It cannot get better this way.How can it get better? How can it hurt less? It cant hurt more anyway! Do you go numb get strong or just forget? Is the pain finite does it burn itself out? Do you let the wolf in feed the monster in the basement? Can you learn to carry the box forever? Does your life grow larger around the hole within it? Is there still a meaningful story you can tell with a meaningless tragedy at the center? Is this a world where these things are possible?I dont know. I sure didnt know what was in store for me or my wife. The world is uncertain its state impermanent. Maybe  this is my little hope  the pain changes too.,widowers,d7c9n1w,10,t5_2swuk

These events severely change us and it shows but its nothing to feel bad about. Feel what you need to feel but try not to be ashamed about it.  Being afraid to talk is understandable as well  I put myself in their shoes. For people that havent experience significant loss they dont know what to say. I cant even imagine is very very real to most people and many believe giving you spacenot overwhelming you is best. I like to bring up Hannah when I can but always in a good light so they know I am okay to talk about her and really want to. If someone mentions going to a national park I talk about our memories together. If someone is talking about a restaurant that her and I went to I chime in with what we ate and why we liked it. That way I am able to still inject her into conversations show others that I am okay to talk about her and act casual with my coworkers.

I wrote them a very strongly worded . page email that was not nice I was not insulting or demeaning but I was stern and unambiguous about the whole thing and what I felt was completely out of bounds and unacceptable. The general summary of the whole thing was that I am an adult and as such I am allowed to have friends over even stay the night that the kids are my kids and as such decisions as to raising them or who can and cannot be around them are mine to make and that I was not in any way asking for permission for my friend and her kids to come up for the weekend. I closed by saying that I would not bring it up after this and that I considered the matter closed so there was no need for discussion at the dinner.Thanksgiving dinner went off without a hitch not a word was said about it by either side and it was actually one of the better family gatherings we had been to over the years.Friend delayed coming up till Thursday night and we had a damn good  days here...

11036789,0,t3_5xinei,I had a nightmare about this while he was still alive.  If they would resent me or think I didnt do enough or love enough or respect enough.  I got a lecture for that that I was doing more than he could ever ask for.  And fortunately his family have been kind.  His mother told me even though he was her son longer than he was my partner he was mine in the end.  His advice to me after my anxiety from the dream was to stand my ground and not let them walk all over me.  Theyre grieving too and have a flurry of emotions they are dealing with.  But you have just as much of a right to grieve.  Surprisingly the only lash outs Ive encountered are from my own mother regarding his death.  Id say continue to respect his memory your way and if they dont respect that maybe one day theyll be embarrassed for their cruelty.  And if not that says more about them than it does you.  Whenever I feel lost and I find something that directs my thoughts I try to share it with his mother because in the end at least I know I tried.  All we really own is our actions.I wish I could help you more but I wish you the best of luck.,widowers,dej015g,3,t5_2swuk

11138305,0,t3_5yz1rd,So sorry for the loss of your husband I lost my husband suddenly in April  and for our first wedding anniversary July  I traveled to see my best friend in Colorado to spread his ashes and that morning I got a tattoo of an arrow on my outer forearm that says take your shot in his handwriting. I like it bc its not an obvious memorial tattoo and people ask about it.lt I think getting whatever serves you a happy memory or a positive inspiration is great!,widowers,deuikn3,3,t5_2swuk

11184486,0,t3_5znrdq,I think that is the hardest part for me. We had our lives all planned out. We knew each other inside and out. We finished each others sentences all the time. Its just hard to conceive that that is all gone now. I doubt I will ever find someone I can be that close to again in my life. ,widowers,dezqyj4,3,t5_2swuk
11325595,0,t1_dfeu486,Thank you for the kind words I appreciate it a lot. The writing is cathartic Im glad that you and others can relate to it as well.Im not sure how the trip will go. I imagine itll be emotional but Ill probably need to bottle a lot of things up unless Im with the right group after a lot of drinking. Well see.,widowers,dffqk2s,1,t5_2swuk
11355375,0,t3_620vi6,The seventhmonth mark was on st my birthday on the rd and her birthday on the th tomorrow. Im sandwiched between two devasting days.I didnt want to be reminded that as I grow older she stays the same so I took my birthday off Facebook and gave friendsfamily a heads up that I didnt want any celebration. Her eldest sister and boyfriend spent the night with me though  pizza carrot cake and video games. The day before I had a bit of a panic attack and bought a few items that Hannah would have given me were she still around.Im not quite sure how to deal with my birthday anymore. I wish I didnt have one. We always celebrated together.,widowers,dfj401b,3,t5_2swuk

11566180,0,t3_652grw,My counselor asked me the same thing and it annoyed me to no end to feel like I had to come up with an answer. Interesting too that I am also at  years. Not quite but almost. Everything youve said I feel. I want to do something. I NEED to do something. But what?  Ive moved on from initial horrors and am now stuck in the nothingness of it all. ,widowers,dg715li,3,t5_2swuk
11589156,0,t1_dg9hz3i,Thats not selfish at all. You guys gave to each other. If the shoe were in the other foot I know hed be saying the same thing. I did some bang up job on something at work yesterday but the pride in that work turned to sadness when I realized she is no longer waiting at home for me to tell me how proud she was of my accomplishment. We all celebrated each other but now theyre not here to be the other half.,widowers,dg9mzor,4,t5_2swuk
11626977,0,t1_dgdwhes,Everyone is different. My wifes care was more on and off. Talking to my therapist she said that some people who dealt with prolonged illnesses resolve their grief sooner than those whose spouse was healthy and passed unexpected.But three weeks out. Just after the funeral. I was you. Get up try and eat figure out what the minimal I had to do was to keep my mind occupied was then repeat.Almost three months out and Im just trying to refocus that energy into something productive and to me that is focusing it on myself.As sad as I am that she is gone and as much as I would like her back. There is some relief that neither one of us has to struggle any more with her illness. We both got some piece in different ways.,widowers,dgdxhtc,3,t5_2swuk

11678014,0,t3_66mq09,These words mean nothing in the face of what you are facing all I can do is say I have been there not as suddenly but as brutally probably over a three year period where it really began to dawn on me that Henry would not live and it was like an ancient redwood falling in a silent forest this life this unspeakably beautiful existence which walked upon this earth and contained worlds within now in its twilight and having to leave not of choice but to join the eternity we arise from and must all return to our home in one tiny galaxy amongst millions of galaxies a vast drama of existence and death and birth and death again. The universe itself breathes in and out and one day collapses upon itself only to explode again in another big bang.  We are all a part of this eternal cycle. A trillion to one odds brought you both together for this brief blip if it be one month or seventy years its all so brief and the only moment that ever existed between you both is when love showed up you enjoyed something eternal and outside of time together.  My words may seem like nonesense but this is what I feel and felt and know having lost the only person that really ever mattered so deeply that losing him was losing myself. And now the slow painful process of being born begins anew.,widowers,dgjpwr3,7,t5_2swuk
