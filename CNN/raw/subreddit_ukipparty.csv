TRACES system see below Global  FinanceI dug around and there will be things at a Europe level we can includeHere we go Dr. RAE Norths done some heavylifting or us and provided an eg of where sometimes Europe can act together successfullybeneficiallyEU regulation the banning of sweet perfumed fleshgtFrom a Europhile perspective this is a classic example of the Single Market in action at its best providing a service at a European level that could not be managed as efficiently by individual member states. Of nearly  notifications in  the UK supplied less than  so the magnifier effect is evident. The most notifications come from Germany.gtThen of course the FVO inspectors carry out the inspection functions in India and elsewhere in the world functions which the UK would have to carry out and fund directly if it was not part of the EU system. Before joining the EU the UK did have its own network of overseas inspectors. Either we would have to reinstate this system or remain part of the EU system.gtClearly it would be far more expensive to furnish an entirely national system and without the more extensive data gathering capability this would not function as well as the EUs system.

1254733,0,t1_ciankyc,gt but the story was probably downvoted because the blog post doesnt even attempt to maintain a semblance of impartiality. Its quite obviously written by someone that hates UKIP and what they stand for which undermines any justifiable points it might raiseTrue but I dont worry as much. If we compare an Owen Jones he criticizes and uses that as grist to power his own political windmill.Whereas here its easier to see the mind of someone who opposes the actual things UKIP doesrepresents  and that then is useful so long as you can differentiate between the personal and the objective. So I think a bit fire in this subreddit can be good and hence post it. Others that twist their points for their own agenda are almost worthless eg Jones or Clegg.gtBut yes theyve become more disliked by nonUKIP voters over the last few weeks. You put it down to them being antiimmigrant.This is the useful bit. We want to know how much this holds and how to counter it? I think also we need to check if weve maxed the clear AntiMass Immigration  open borders vote as well who would support more controls of immigration and what message on that would be conducive to them? Probably less of the rhetoric of anecdotes of on trains and native tongues and more on security eg jihadists more on primary school places in London are going to be full in a few years more on the fiasco of the EU itself in sorting out the boat people and more on the the AGREED and FAIR policy that UKIP would promise to put to the people and let them decide finally once and for all out of realistic options? Something like that maybe? Weve got to sidestep the medias cycnical attempts to throw enough mud at UKIP by depriving them of mud.gtI dont believe its racist to want controlled immigration from EU countries and the attacks that UKIP faced over the course of that election campaign have made me never want to vote for one of the other parties ever again.Completely agree huge betrayal by the government who sold out to the EU and effectively told the electorate to be silent about mentioning immigration or voicing concerns.gtThe subject of leaving the EU is less important to the partys supporters than stopping immigration  something UKIP cannot deliver because it has no plan and plainly does not understand the governance of immigration in the modern world.From the blog the way I see it immigration is the most VISIBLE of the layers of CONTROL of the EU and hence the British peoples TOLERANCE is lower here.This is the key. What UKIP need to do is find similarly VISIBLE defects with the EU then promote the POSITIVE case for an alternative Brexit.But Brexit is something that is not widely available from UKIP unlike FLEXCIT which is the best of the Brexit plans Ive come across. However that is an aside the cautionary tale is that knowing Brexit will modify what we say on posing solutions when we peel back the layers of control of the EU and expose them to the British people for gaining their vote.Immigration has been a useful tool we to find more by digging into the EU and digging into Brexit.,ukipparty,ciartl3,1,t5_2vl06

OTgtAfter the defection of Mr Carswell to ukip I looked further into ukip and its current policies.As far as I can make out they should have a much more substantial offering after the end of month Manifesto reveal in Doncaster at the Party Conference?gtI rather like ukip and its hard nosed approach towards immigration of which have aggravated me for a while.I think theyve been very conducive to raising the public awareness and interest in seeing our useless government actually do what they say theyre doing and do what theyre being overpaid to do without failing so horrendously and lying so malignantly.Yet and heres the first of many such warnings to come... leaving the EU is going to be infinitely more complicated and perplexing than most people could possibly have wished for and Migration Policy is going to be a harsh landing on achieving what we want and can achieve... this is just a warning... so far... not the actual description let alone explanation...gtIm very much leaning towards voting for Mr Carswell in the byelection next thursday and possibly in the elections next year once I see the new manifesto of course because of ukips policies and the fact Mr Carswell is actually giving his constituency a say with a byelection instead of simply retaking his seat.Id say vote for himA Hes going to win anywayB Carswell is one of the few very decent and interesting politicians Recall Bill etc and hes doing what hes saying finally now Thats the first step towards a better future.gt im rather ignorant when it comes to the EU as a whole.Theres a full history free to read written by Dr. RAE North and Christopher Booker The Great DeceptionThe title could not be more accurate. Its surprising well written I may allow myself to say its pacy in a politically exciting romp through time and wheelerdealing. If you do decide to read it youll really really KNOW what the EU is. You can google for the structure and how it runs simply enough but to understand its real nature read the book.gtI thought asking its voters would give me a true representation on what would happen if we were to leave.Again referring to Dr. RAE North youll have to read his Flexcit The definitive EU exit plan for BritainThis is the state of the art. I appreciate other commentators will have their own pet theory Ive all categories of Brexit and a dozen or so papers and this is by far and away at least imho the best in the business Its so far ahead of the rest of the efforts I dont even see much point in debating or convincing you. Its for each individual to read and assess for themselves.However some useful information although fallacious can be gleaned hereDavid Campbell Bannerman has published The Ultimate Plan B A Positive Vision of an independent Britain outside the European Union booklet. AKA EEALiteAnd his documentary version Taking The Fear Out Of BrexitgtSo how would life change for the average individual if we were to leave the EU tomorrow? Thanks in advance.A good question as it simulates a very useful requirement for leaving the EU comparing the day before the Referendum to the day after the Referendum the ideal answer  Very little to nothing at all.This stems from the transition requiring the minimum in FUD as per Dr. North ie fear uncertainty doubt which cause major disruption both during a referendum and to the marketseconomy.The reason its important to ensure this is minimal to negligible is that. Brexit is POLITICAL democratic referendum  not economic its about sovereignty and this is what we want people to vote on and ignore economic FUD. If its benign then theres no fuel to use to talk about it and it ceases to be an issue. Brexit is already complex enough to keep the message SIMPLE and SMART to disseminate to millions and educate them then this is where the meaning needs to match the message. Brexit is a process and not an event when we leave we need time to resolve negotiations positively with minimum disruption which continues for years afterwards The key is to get the will of the people to mandate Brexit. Its not about bsing about numbers based on economic assumptions which intrinsically means theyre built on faultyshifting foundations.. Brexit must be resoundingly positive About the UK having pride initself rejoining the Global arena recapturing major sovereign policy powers and realigning to a SET GOAL that is already clearly enunciated and detailed.. Brexit must be about positive Sovereignty but also avoidance of the intractable interference of the EU and the declining EZ and the Federal ambitons of this bloc which are going in a different direction to the one the UK should be going ie Trade amp Trustvs Politics amp Deception,ukipparty,cka14u7,4,t5_2vl06

2433914,0,t3_2nd8tg,gtFrom January if a UK business makes a sale in another EU member state they will have to pay VAT there. The only way to comply is to register for VAT with that country or register for HMRCs Mini One Stop Shop scheme VAT MOSS. According to the HMRC website the VAT MOSS scheme requires businesses to submit a single calendar quarterly return and VAT payment to HMRC which then sends the appropriate information and payment to each relevant member states tax authority.gtAmanda Tickel tax partner at KPMG UK says Its important to understand that the UK threshold of  is not being removed and microbusinesses selling digital services to customers in the UK can still trade VAT free as long as they are below that threshold.gtWhat is changing is that all sales of relevant digital services to EU customers outside the UK will be subject to the local VAT regardless of the value of the sales as there is no minimum threshold.gtTickel adds The issue is that once registered for UK VAT the threshold no longer applies and all UK sales become liable for UK VAT.gtLorraine Dallmeier who runs an online skincare school has organised a Twitter storm on  November to protest against the changes. The new legislation is going to have a huge financial impact on people as well as the administrative burden that comes with it says Dallmeier.

3242217,0,t1_coy1olv,For starters Ive never seen you post here before. Secondly nothing you have said contradicts the video  the matter that is really being raised is why white countries specifically have State mandated diversity targets which only serve to marginalise the White population.Its clear at this point that there have been many negatives to mass immigration similar to those described in the video  many UK cities have ethnic ghettos where white people are a minority. This is not a good thing  we have a fractured insecure society that is at odds with itself and in which interethnic tensions are rife.Furthermore we have seen how these nonWhite areas are prone to rejecting the host culture favouring practices from their counties of origin the corruption of the democratic process observed recently in Tower Hamletts and Bradford are examples of these as are the practices of FGM honour killing Sharia law Islamic extremism and forced marriages.Indeed it is standard rhetoric of those that favour open border mass immigration and state multiculturalism that there is no such thing as an indegenous White population to the UK and that standing up for the native whites is racist.If I were you I would watch the video again without resorting to the knee jerk accusation of thats racist which is probably in you as the result of leftist indoctrination via education or the media. ,ukipparty,coy2acf,3,t5_2vl06

Though one of their recent blunders that most people miss is the fact that Browns government made it mandatory for students to stay in school until  years of age! Who are we? America? I feel this will only make students more inept of the real world of work. It will keep them in an academic rut until  with no stimulation or incentive to work. They will leave school too late and hit a brick wall where their lack of experience doesnt make for a good workforce.

Internationalism is another reaction of the same general kind  and to the very same general circumstances. Like nationalism it is far more ambiguous and complicated than the selfimage in which it lives. Capitalist internationality generated both nationalism and internationalism.

5325125,0,t3_3nygwa,I do wonder how the SNP will position themselves tactically. They claim that if the UK voted to leave the EU but Scotland didnt that they could call another referendum. I agree. They sure as hell wont get one anytime soon any other way. But in order for the UK to leave it needs much bigger support than that from Scotland. So what do the SNP do. Do they not campaign? Because the ideal situation for them is vote to remain in Scotland wins by a small majority but vote to leave wins a small majority overall. Coming out of the EU wont be done overnight. Most expect it to take around  years. Scotland couldnt have a referendum until after this period. You also have to allow there to be a campaign period. So dont expect them to be given a referendum date for anything short of  years after the UK voted to leave the EU. At which point the EU project would be in serious doubt already. Scotland would have to then hold a separate referendum for joining the EU. Some think they would be allowed straight back in. But as the EU will be failing they most likely wont. They will be asking for Scotland to sacrifice far more than they have so far. Such as higher net fees joining the euro etc. The position of the SNP is an odd one to me. They would have some respect from me if they actually campaigned for proper independence. ,ukipparty,cvschgw,0,t5_2vl06

I certainly will be in June. I bet there are a fair few of you here that are the same. But you dont want to talk about it as you see the lack of action as wrong. It isnt and there is a sizable disconnect between national and local UKIP. Just take a look at the Lib Dems for example. They always perform well in the local elections. Only delusional idiots would claim they could replicate that vote share at a General Election if it were held next month. I see online polls as more representative. It shows a tight race. No way is remain going to win by  points. Its absurd. People are also trying to associate the silent conservative vote with remain. Which is just wrong. Its Brexit that is the dirty word.
