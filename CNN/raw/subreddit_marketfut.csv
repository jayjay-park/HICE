6501093,0,t3_44o2dz,Wait a couple of days and then sell him for whatever hes going for. Having coins tied up in bad investments stops you making any coins so be careful to get rid of bad stock as soon as you see it start to fall. Losing a few thousand isnt a big deal. The most important thing is to keep trading everyday.  If youre stuck with cards youre losing money on them as well as not making any coins from trading. If i only had k coins to trade with i wouldnt be buying cards for k. Id be looking for stuff ltk and mass bidding on  cards at a time and check regularly to put more bids down as soon as anything gets outbid. Even stuff around the k mark would be good. ,marketfut,czrrfzy,2,t5_3bzb5
