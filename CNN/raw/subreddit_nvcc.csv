5203012,0,t1_cvd0cfo,about two years ago i was mostly into indie psychedelic music and thought edm was just a fad but i swallowed my pride and tried to get into it. for about a year i mostly listen to big room artist top  kind of music mostly electro n big room like avicii hardwell all that stuff. then after a while it became repetitive and i listened to disclosures settle and that got me into house and the branched out to deepchill house. i also cam across armins intense and that just blew my mind. so right now im still dissecting armis intense and im mostly listening to oliver heldens and artist similiar to him. i knows hes not exactly deep and more of futureshallow but i enjoy it. i do listen to some yotube mixes and hope to drown myself in the genre but i like to take one genre at the time so i can get an organized music library if that makes sense. i see Olivier tomorrow at echostage actually should be fun. do you dj with the badassraves crew?,nvcc,cvd5mlm,1,t5_2spbf
