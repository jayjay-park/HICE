3587230,0,t3_3191ss,Came to ask this as well. I do community theatre and Google was showing me the time to get to the theatre.  All well and good while the show ran but its been done for almost a month and Google still pops up at least twice a day with  mins to...I might not do a show at that spot for a year or two  how do I clear it?  There must be a way to reset memorized locations.  I did just try deleting the location history in Maps settings...well see if that works.Edit  For the record that location is not set to either homework in Maps.,googlenow,cq167i2,1,t5_2ufhz
