690427,0,t1_cgiqze1,Ideally wouldve liked to keep it at the other sub but it didnt work out. The problem was essentially the blog spamming that was going on and the lack of control arising out of blog owners not contributing to the subreddit but just dumping their sites for them to increase their visibility. Were trying to change that and become a more contributory and quality subreddit so this was the best alternative. ,human_resources,cgir503,2,t5_2qpw1

Do business analytics and then get a job as an HR analyst. best of both worlds. ,human_resources,czi6fnj,3,t5_2qpw1

If youve made her aware of the problem and the depletion of her PTO days Id just make sure you have a cover for all her future shifts on hand start interviewing replacements and then the next time she comes in catch her at the door and ask for a private word. Weve allowed you to take off more than the standard PTO offered for employees sick time even given that you dont give coverage notice in time for your shifts and dont respond to calls during business hours. Unfortunately as youve now taken more PTO than is available not only for sick days but for your own paid vacation time and continue to not only give us minimal notice prior to a missed shift but do not acknowledge supervisors attempts to get in contact with you over your delinquency we are going to have to terminate your position. You will be paid through the end of this week provided you are present and willing to work for that time but should you call out during the remainder of the week please consider your employment terminated effective that date. Where should we mail your tax information and final pay stub?The issue here isnt that youre terminating her over sick days that she is owed youre terminating her because she has stopped coming to work. You cant get into any kind of trouble for that!,human_resources,d2090b4,2,t5_2qpw1
