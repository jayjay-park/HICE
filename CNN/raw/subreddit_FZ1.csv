8428050,0,t1_d5uxifm,Even without a tune it ran fine just popped a lot when coming down the RPMs. Combined with vcyclenuts ECU flash and a PCIII I just threw a basic map with similar mods on and it runs beautifully. Can be ran hard runs cool sounds amazing and the power is great.The Coffman pipe looks awesome and the build quality is really good.  bucks seems like a lot for a tiny pipe but damn its fucking sexy. Pretty easy to install too. e I found the included instructions. You need  Ratchet  Socket Power Drill with  bit Torque Wrench and a Pop Rivet gun. I happen to have all that laying around but yeah. The only problem I had was the angle at which you drill a new hole to fit the pipe on. The center stand was in the way but I was stubborn and kept going at it instead of just removing the thing haha.,FZ1,d5v1pw6,2,t5_3dc9t
