6089111,0,t1_cyhhlci,One of my coworkers made it and I literally fell to my knees and then on my back in the middle of the bar and laughed until I couldnt breathe right along with my coworker that made the joke. It was great. She makes a lot of memes. Ill share them with other partners. xDD,sbuxpartners,cyhrdpy,1,t5_2vcfg
7192754,0,t3_4bal3n,I have two crazy DT moments. New store first summer in a new city very hot. Woman comes to the order box order a normal CRF I tell her the total she moves forward. Easy whatevs. She pulls up older car windows rolled down. She is sweating as there is obviously no AC. She is talking on her phone but shes being safe by doing it hands free. She does not have a bluetooth her phone resting on her very large bosom. I tell her the total and I watch as she removes the phone from her boobshelf and as she spreads decolletage Im horrified to see her reach into her boobwallet pull out six wet and sweat dollars. She attempts to hand them to me. Actually its on us today! Have a nice day! NOT okay. Same summer at the end of happy hour. Drive thru is filled. Ive already take a persons order yet theyre stuck at the order box so Im helping the person at the window. I hear someone scream from parking lot next to the DT lane. A man is chasing a slow moving car. BANG BANG BANG I have to double take because I wasnt quite sure what Ive just heard. Ive only heard gunshots on TV but never in real life. I look outside again. The man running is holding a gun pointed at the car. BANG BANG. I go directly to my Supervisor who is now very frightened and not sure what to do. We try to empty out the drive thru for the customers safety. But I waited  minutes for my drink Im not leaving without it BITCH IF YOU DONT GIT! We evacuate the lobby and move everyone behind the counter and lock the doors. By this time the police arrive and they ask me for a statement since I was the only one to actually see the gunman. To this day I dont know if they caught the guy.,sbuxpartners,d1vr8uf,1,t5_2vcfg

11515447,0,t3_649tr4,I was promoted to shift after just  months with the company so theres no way thats true. With both scheduling and promotions though it is the call of the dm and sm. They have the power to say I dont allow promotions weekend availability but they also have the power to say sure. ,sbuxpartners,dg19zy7,1,t5_2vcfg
