938343,0,t1_chawrph,He was a monumental asshole.I cant wrap my mind around all the people who are actual fans of his work though.  Could it be a form of selfloathing to embrace an author with such open contempt for his readers that he takes delight in disappointing them?,FCJbookclub,chay16m,3,t5_2vvax

1115918,0,t1_chv4wpr,Yeah the end annoyed me but I kind of anticipated the main plot from the beginning in some form possibly because of the talk from my family. Still a good read I liked the angle. But seriously if you liked that you might like Evil the second on my list there. ,FCJbookclub,chv50t4,2,t5_2vvax

1347641,0,t3_29hovj,I havent had time to read for pleasure this month but I listened to the audiobook of The Crimson Campaign and Im about halfway through the first Dresden Files book. The reader for The Crimson Campaign was absolutely atrocious but the story was good enough that I still enjoyed it. The reader for the Dresden Files is James Marsters and he helps make up for a fairly boring story. Also I finally finished listening to The Wise Mans Fear. Id read it before but going back through it was even more enjoyable. The narrator is also freaking amazing.  would recommend if you like fantasy and audiobooks.,FCJbookclub,cil84ih,2,t5_2vvax

5828906,0,t3_3v0tbl,I mostly read a bunch of related documents to this course on ancient Greek civilization.   year old translated writing  is SOOOOO DRYYYYYY.    I would like to pose a question though.  Fantasyscifi series greater than  books with a good ending  do they exist?  Racking my brain Im having trouble thinking of one.  Someone was talking about how excited they were for the next ASOIAF book and it hit me that Im not.  Havent even read Dance with Dragons yet and dont really intend to.  I dont see any kind of satisfying conclusion being pulled out of it.  I kind of have an idea that the worldbuilding in fantasyscifi dwarfsblunts such things but it may just be that the worldbuilding is easier so you find it more than good endings.  ,FCJbookclub,cxjp1la,3,t5_2vvax

Its fucking forever and theres a lot of King fellating himself in there. Theres even more in Song of Susannah. Im about  of the way through The Dark Tower now. Im finishing it just so that I can be done with it.Ill probably read something with a less selfindulgent author after this. Like you know the Twilight series. King is the fucking worst.,FCJbookclub,darl8rs,2,t5_2vvax
