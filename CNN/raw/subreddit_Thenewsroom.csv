Not merely something masquerading as good but good work. And oddly enough I feel like the Newsroom is likely doing what Will and Mackenzie set out to do in terms of informing the public.

2538070,0,t1_cmpuqii,Agreed. Going on television would not have helped her at all. I had every sympathy for the character and wish she had a better recourse but she really didnt and neither do many reallife victims in the same circumstance. Six months ago in TVtime Don could have run with a phenomenal story about this accuser and how they chose not to put her on TV because of the revictimization that would invariably occur. Alas it is not six months ago.,Thenewsroom,cmpv1d5,5,t5_2rd6i
2542467,0,t1_cmqdm74,Interesting. I feel the exact opposite. She put the writers room on blast and so Sorkin felt it necessary to defend himself and he did. No one knows or cares about any of this if she doesnt speak up like that. Its her right to do so but there are also consequences to her actions. Whether or not it was worth it is entirely her prerogative but she was only attacked because she attacked first.,Thenewsroom,cmqfrgb,11,t5_2rd6i
2543583,0,t1_cmqk1a4,Two points One in  is not insignificant.More importantly that statistic is based on a study where a false report was one where either overwhelming evidence came in to show that the rape could not have occurred or the accuser fully retracted. It doesnt actually show what percentage of allegations are false only what allegations are proven false. It would be like saying Since only  of rapes result in a conviction  of reports are false. We simply dont know what percentage of rape accusations or official rape reports are false and this talking point of  that has emerged attempts to say we know something that the study behind it does not actually show.,Thenewsroom,cmql0g7,16,t5_2rd6i

Moreso how does she know that it went down the way she claims and not the other way around? They call it intoxication for a reason. And I think that without explicitly saying it Don knew that such a question would come up and was trying to protect her from that in the only way he could  by imploring her not to do the interview.,Thenewsroom,cmqzn8e,1,t5_2rd6i
2551725,0,t1_cmr7wc8,I agree with the analysis that the compromises are all to fight another day.  But I would hope that had the selling out of journalistic integrity continued it would have been justified.

The networks not going to wait forever.gt gtIsaac Its your call Dana but pretty soon its going to be my call. Cause heres the thing I cant let it be their call.Charlie and Issac are in pretty similar situations  corporate breathing down their necks to change something about the show and making every effort to insulate the talent from the management.
