From what theyve been shown to do before it makes sense its no more evil than what modern governments have done and the long period of wartime gave them an oppurtunity to massively expand their reach.

59419,0,t1_cejwx3j,I didnt really feel like it was forced.  Her moments of rampancy and her eventual death were the only times the dynamic was really any different.  And its because those times were the times John was realizing that she was slowly losing herself and he was going to lose her.  Past Halos have shown that Cortana and John had a bond.  Halo  had that as one of its main themes.  In Halo  that bond is simply taken outside of its comfort zone where Cortana and John always come out unscathed and always know what to do.  And because of that they become more aware of how much they rely on each other.  Its exactly what makes sense to happen in that scenario.She shouldnt come back because then all the implications that her absence has for him will be gone.  Instead of learning how to grow and change in order to deal with loss hell just be on another quest to get her back so she can take care of everything and he can stay a broken shell.  Instead these next games can still be about massive scale wars and battles and secret installations but also about what Master Chief decides he needs to do and who he will become.,HaloStory,cel71ru,6,t5_2vomh

I choose to believe that Halo Reachs campaign is not canon because it conflicts so much with the already established story of the universe. Like he said above the best thing to do is almost treat it like its two different universes. I also like to believe that the Eric Nylund books are the number one source of whats canon.

1489049,0,t1_cj2txd5,You may want to look up  mate. Based on HaloRebirth by Greg Bear After the reseeding of the galaxy was complete the remaining Forerunners exiled themselves as according to the IsoDidact they were done meddling in the affairs of others. This exile has also been referred to as a Great Journey by the IsoDidact who wished to bear the record of the Forerunner civilizations failures and their ultimate sacrifice for future generations.So I did not make up anything about them leaving its all there for anyone to find should they have a deep love of Halo lore. You are however correct that not many Forerunners survived and you do mention in brackets that theyre almost dead. This is true but they arent extinct  the survivors exiled themselves in disgust at the galaxy wide genocide they accomplished calling it a great journey.The Halo Encyclopedia even states that the surviving Forerunners hidden behind the Line Installations opted to abandon the galaxy entirely moving on to parts unknown following the activation of the array so thats another source for you.Suck it nerds. xDTBH claiming I lied without at least asking for a source or providing your own that disproves what I said is kinda rude and I was genuinely hurt by your attitude. ,HaloStory,cj2xdwp,3,t5_2vomh

1683461,0,t1_cjr8hni,Im doing a k crossover atm its pretty easy to balance if you know what to do. The best part is comparing Spartans to Space Marines. Both are genetically augmented super soldiers however they are made for very different roles. Space Marines are powerhouses in open combat the way their wargear is made is to go onto the OPEN battlefield and crush hard positions. Where Astartes Space Marines are a literal hammer Spartans are more of a dagger. They where meant to hunt down insurgents and it shows. Nimble stealthy and wicked fast SPARTANs are made for counter insurgency as such they make great insurgents themselves. In a fight Spartans would have to take away the Astartes advantage in numbers and toughness by choosing the fight. If they get the drop on the Astartes the Spartans would inflect causalities and then slip away. The way I think about Spartans is theyre discount Eldar. Eldar speed and reflexes just no pysker powers. ,HaloStory,cjrd32n,2,t5_2vomh

You can argue all the other armour abilities Although not that most of them return in Halo  mysteriously but armour lock somehow makes Spartan IIIs temporarily immune to damage. Sticky grenades that meant death for the chief are shrugged off by these weaker spartans.That and the fact that armour abilities often tended to be better versions of equipment. Except for active Camo which is worse in Reach and gets worse yet in .The point is that even with the cop out excuse of Reach having experimental tech  which is widely distributed throughout Reach but wouldnt be on the ship full of soldiers escaping with all the gear they can carry  there are still far too many inconsistencies with regards to the lore.  ,HaloStory,cnew2ll,0,t5_2vomh

3369459,0,t3_2yqgph,Sword striking shield. The names change and the methods more deadly but the basic concept exists. The mighty sword of an elite warrior banging its sword on the shield of the dauntless Spartan. Equals in strength these two warriors were locked in combat. The Elite son of Sanghelios inheritor of his fathers lands and proud warrior felt his blood rush. The warrior before him a Spartan proved to be his equal. Someone he could go all out on. Someone he could fight endlessly without tedium. This warrior proves herself to be worthy. Perhaps It was at this thought he faltered. He kept fighting but something in his heart was pulling the energy out. The passion was leaving him the more he thought of it. What was victory to him? Could he return to his homeworld? He and his brothers in the remnant were considered traitors and idiots by most of the galaxy. His family only joined because of an honor bound agreement made to Jul Mdama long ago. If everything worked out the traditions he held dear would be erased. Replaced with a world of uniformity. Whats wrong split jaw? Cracked the human. Cant keep up?The Elite tightly grasped his sword and used the last of his fury to knock the shield out of the Spartans hands. He used his blade to cut at her legs forcing her to grunt and kneel. The Elite felt victory in his hands. The Spartan was breathing heavily looking up at the Elite with her helmet betraying no emotion. The Elite nodded and prepared to honor his opponent by removing her head. As the Elite raised his sword he felt a sharp pain in his chest. The Spartan rose up and stabbed him. Im a fool... The Elite fell to his knees the knife still within him. The pain surged throughout his body.The Spartan removed the blade letting blood splatter everywhere. He looked up at the Spartan and held out his sword to her. She tilted her head and took the blade. He held out his hand straight and made a cutting motion to his head. The Spartan paused and then shrugged. She activated the blade and removed his head without a second thought.The last thoughts within the Elites mind were for himself.

Land assault a bit of corridor shooting space combat battle on board a Covenant ship  all in one level! Brilliantly executed space combat far better than that of Halo  beautiful vistas and cutscenes made all the better because your custom Noble  was in them and a wide variety of enemies and weapons.I still think Jorges death was a bit cheap though.

I dont think shes jealous of John for being Halseys favorite as she showed no ill intentions towards Fred Kelly or Linda who were with Halsey for quite some time helping her out while John was out there kicking ass and saving the galaxy.In the trailer and in the poster we saw that bird thing which is rumoured to be a War Sphinx. After what happened to the Didact in Escalation Ive got a feeling that he has taken control of that war sphinx.We know that the Arbiters Covenant is still allied with the UNSC and are fighting the rebellion based off Halo  Anniversarys cutscenes. We know that Sangheilios is going to be in the game based off the poster and Lockes trailer and we know that at least one forerunner machine is involved I doubt theyd put that bird in the poster if it didnt hold any importance.In Hunt the Truth they talk about slipspace anomalies that could be caused by either neural physics or large objects moving through space which hints that something big is about to go down. Could be the return of the Flood or it could be the Didact mobilizing large military assets but somethings about to happen and given the destruction on the colony in the trailers John might just be in the middle of it notice how his helmet wasnt cracked but in the first reveal trailer it was?.Anyways dont bother replying I already know your opinion on Halsey you dont need to spread more of it here.,HaloStory,cqquuq7,-1,t5_2vomh

Dont get me wrong I appreciate his back story and the need to have him sort of as a bridge as a character that has interacted with both forerunners and humans. Im just sleep a little uneasy knowing that the luckiest spartan in the universe couldnt destroy a moniitor after firing x amounts of laser blasts to the  monitor then was at the heart of an imploding halo ring. now for my favoriteMasterchief and his way of looking at things. you dont really get to see his opinion on much in the games but I love FoR and FSs portrayal of Chiefs thoughts. He is smarthe calculates the terminal velocity of a pin in a weight room based off the seconds it takes for it to drop but he doesnt overthink things. I just finished reading the Kilo trilogy and cant help but think how its good that chief simplifies things. He doesnt dwell too long on the ethics of his leaders having him tested against ODSTs. Nor does he dwell on those he wasnt able to save on New Pheonixat least not in an outspoken way. He does what he can where he is with what he has. I understand that Osman has to think about things because shes in charge of ONI but I think that as a spartan she would have thought better than to think that Parangosky saved her from Halsey. Masterchief and a lot of his squad kinda share that mentality of lock and load dont overthink it and trust your judgementwhich is a culmination of decades of training and learning. I really like it.

After all countermeasures failed the Forerunners activated the Halo Array in  B.C unleashing galactic destruction and destroying almost all sentient life forms in the Galaxy. However the human race and many other species throughout the galaxy had been indexed before the purge by The Librarian. Population samples were preserved on the Ark or within the Shield Worlds and out of range of the Halo Array.The Flood was contained and unable to reproduce and grow due to lack of hosts and eventually died out. The only surviving specimens were contained in state of the art highsecurity Forerunner research facilities such as the Halo Installations and the Threshold Gas Mine.

It drives me fucking nuts. She did the same for the Republic Commando novels. All of the sudden everyone was a crying mess reflecting on the existential things about life. All that said she has created some good characters theyre engaging and interesting but only to a point. Like OP said everyone in her books is focused on the preachy MORAL point of view. They tend to become increasingly one sided in their perspectives. It doesnt help that it seems like she had a blatant disregard for looking at it from a contextually military point of view which is how the novel PRIMARILY shouldve been written seeing as these are you know MILITARY characters.

5428477,0,t3_3pe60j,We are  years in the future. We have colonized planets very far away from our home of Earth. The people on the distant planets feel that they shouldnt be governed by people all the way back on Earth and other planets closer to our home of Earth. In response to some might argue unfair laws and rules the distant planets peoples start to fight back with violence.Back on Earth and the other inner colonies the governing body is slightly worried about these rebellions in the outer colonies. They have decided to continue a once promising program. This involves the followingKidnapping  year olds that meet the genetic criteria for being a Spartan. Augmenting their bodies in ways that kill the majority of the kids.They are trained to a degree that enables them to be absolute killing machines before most would hit puberty.They are extremely successful with putting down the rebellions of the outer colonies. Thats when the last thing anyone expected to happen does exactly that.Aliens arrive. Intelligent life. The Covenant. They attack several of our homeworlds and the UNSC is taken by surprise. Luckily though they have the Spartans. The Covenant is kicking our ass in space combat. They have more firepower they have more maneuverability and they have huge fleets. On the ground it is an opposite story. We kick so much Covenant ass in hand to hand ground based combat Thanks to the Spartans mainly. We fight the Covenant for quite some time. Where is Master Chief? He is on the planet Reach. Which has just been attacked by the Covenant and in a last ditch attempt to save all they can they haul ass out of Reach with Chief on board. Cortana uses some coordinates and it leads them to the very first Halo ring. This is where Halo Combat Evolved begins.Halo Combat EvolvedThe Covenant followed the ship that Chief was on not for any particular reason but just to finish off the battle that was started on the planet Reach. Chief is woken out of cryosleep and starts fighting off the Covenant who have boarded the ship. Chief crash lands on the Halo ring after the Covenant have overtaken the ship the captain Keyes crash lands the ship on the ring separately.From there Chief tries to coordinate with the brass and stop the Covenant from accessing a Weapons of Mass Destruction on Halo. Turns out that the Weapons of Mass Destruction they are looking for is actually the Flood.Chief fights off the flood and then stops  Guilty Spark the CPO of this Halo ring from tricking him into igniting the Halo ring and destroying all of the Floods food every living thing.Chief uses the crashed space ship from earlier as a nuclear bomb and breaks apart the massive ring so it cant be fired as the massive galaxy killing weapon that it is.Chief gets away and lives to fight another day.Halo Chief has made it back to friendly space around Earth. He is being celebrated for his bravery on the Halo ring from the previous game. That is when the Covenant attack. The Covenant accidently found where Earth we could go further into it but this is supposed to be a summary.Chief fights them through New Mombasa where The Covenant runs jumps through slip space. This is when Chief and crew follow behind the Covenant in their own ship and arrive at a SECOND HALO RING! They continue onto the new Halo ring and fight off the Covenant trying to avoid them setting off the second ring. Their religious leaders think setting off the ring will bring them into a Great Journey.The Arbiter an Elite who has turned good thanks to seeing that firing the Halo rings wont start a Great Journey stops them from setting it off.Chief is sent to the main headquarters of the Covenant at the same time Arbiter is sent to stop the ring from firing. There the Chief fights his way through to the Covenant leaders bad ass ship. He climbs on board and fights his way through trying to kill the VIPs on board.The ship flies its way back towards earth and Chief rips off a door to the outside and straight up jumps out of the god damn ship with only a door to help his entry into Earths atmosphere.And so begins Halo Halo The Chief and Arbiter team up after Chief crash lands with only his suit and the door. They fight shit. The Covenant Leaders show up on Earth and unleash a massive structure from underneath the African desert. The massive structure turns out to be a portal. A portal to the Ark. The Ark builds new Halo rings. It just pops one out every time another is destroyed. The Ark is also far enough away that the Halo rings wouldnt have harmed any one there.Chief arrives at the Ark and kicks ass.He then finds a new Halo ring being made a replacement for the one he destroyed in HaloCombat Evolved.He explodes the replacement ring and in the process fucks up the Ark so that it isnt functioning properly.When Chief explodes the ring Arbiter and him try to escape the explosion through a slip space jump. Chief in the back of the ship Arbiter in the front. The front makes it through the back of the ship with Chief is lost to the slip space. This faulty jump with the Chief has them end up right in range for the Didacts Shield from the start of Halo  granted they are floating in space so Chief takes a nap for  years or so before they are close enough to it that Cortana wakes him up. Remember though they didnt realize the Shield world was there until the start of Halo .There is a lot I skipped. That is just a rough run through. You can find all of the cutscenes on youtube and that should suffice story wise to explain what Chief has gone through.Also if you read the Fall of Reach youll be just as informed as  of the halo community. editformatting,HaloStory,cw5jky7,17,t5_2vomh

5477271,0,t3_3q3frt,Icon is defined as a widely known symbol. To me its just that something I could ask anyone on the street about and theyd know it. Obviously the scope of the definition is questionable but if you ask me the narrower the definition the better. Captain Americas shield is iconic. The Oval Office is iconic. Mario is iconic. The Master Chief is iconic.If you broaden the definition you go a little more obscure as you lessen the boundaries of icon.My problem with that thread is that lots of folks posting there dont seem to realize that icons are within context iconic. In the context of video games Samus Aran is iconic. Outside of gaming? Good luck finding anyone who can tell her armor from a Star Wars character. Theyll just think shes an orange Stormtrooper.But the Chief? In Western culture hes really wellknown just like Call of Duty the brand not the games and Madden. But in the East? Theyre barely anything.When it comes to genuine icons Id have to say the three most memorable are Superman SpiderMan and Mario in that order. You could ask anyone on the street who has even a remote amount of education if they know any of those figures and theyll tell you they know at least one every time. Those are icons.Granted Ive only cited one actual icon the rest have been fictional. But my primary point here is to demonstrate that what an icon is to you is all about the context from which you perceive that icon. To us the SPNkR is legendary. To anyone who hasnt played Halo? Its an oddlooking rocket launcher from Star Wars or Battlestar Galactica.,HaloStory,cwbrtp8,16,t5_2vomh
5497055,0,t1_cweag81,I wouldve liked a little more explanation. Ive read every single book and consumed every piece of media I could and I was falling beyond during some parts. The Warden is barely explained the Guardians are touched as Death Star Police and they dont explain anything to those unfamiliar to the EU. I know what the domain is I know what the mantle of responsibility is but for people who only play the games? I cant even imagine what theyre thinking. I am proper noun keeper of the proper noun and its secrets. Chief I got access to the proper noun. Thats what my friend kept hearing. They had the perfect opportunity to explain these things when players played as Fire Team Osiris as theyre the new kids on the block. They wasted JulMdama in the first level and somehow the Covenant stand united until the Arbiter defeats them? Whos uniting them? Are they done? This story paces imo great and though I am a huge disbeliever in Cortana coming back Im interested to see where its going. But the campaign just feels so rushed that it doesnt breathe to explain things to players. And is anyone else getting annoyed with Forerunner object with important characterobject goes into slipspace as it explodes? Its happened twice now. Didact and now the Mantles Approach. Its becoming the writers get out of jail card for saving villains and characters. Other than that I think the Warden was just hinting that he knew Johns last name. And I think the Domain is twisting her mind. EDIT Adding on to it the HUNT THE TRUTH part of the game was just lacking. It made it look like we were going to go on a galactic hunt to stop the chief at all costs and his reasoning would be grey. But it was just Im going to Cortana first. And the UNSC is going to say Hunt him down? It just feels off. That and the Hunt only lasts to Meridian where it culminates in a weak fight between Locke and Chief. After that its save the chief. I just have mixed feelings about it right now. Throwing Jul away bringing Cortana back weak character development....... this is going to be THE campaign everyone is decisive about. Reach will probably lack compared to this. ITS NOT ALL BAD THOUGH! I thought Halsey and Palmer were great in this game. Im thinking next game the fireteam is Chief Arbiter Palmer Locke? ,HaloStory,cweauc4,68,t5_2vomh

He ran because he knew an EMP was coming. He could fire a MAC round and hope it stopped it and probably take a blast anyway or jump and figure out how to fight them later. Im willing to bet that it would take about the same time to charge and fire a MAC round as it does to charge up an EMP blast.

So instead of talking about the game outside of fan theories because were left with nothing but questions on almost every topic all weve been doing is theorizing about the next game  which is  years away which only made me even more salty. At least in Halo  we got several resolutions. This time around we resolved... what? Arbiters success on Sanghelios? In quotes because cmon you really think theyd completely remove Covenant races from the game?I think Id be fine with a cliffhanger if theyd just answer literally anything else in the later half of the story.

5595227,0,t1_cwo2nmk,Granted a lot of plot elements from the Forerunner trilogy were confusing including the previous weaker Halo array that sterilized rather than outright destroyed life. However the backstory from the Halo  terminals was entirely predictable. I doubt Bungie even had a concrete origin in mind for the Flood. I believe they were simply stated as an extragalactic threat like WHKs Tyranids  except that ambiguity works for the Tyranids. Their origin could be explained simply by evolution whereas you need some deeper explanation for an evil zombie parasite hellbent on exterminating all life.Also at least we got to SEE the Didact in Halo . Meaningful details on the Forerunners should have been integrated into Halo s main storyline not relegated to throwaway terminals that most people were never going to see anyway. Halo  used terminals for key backstory on their version of the Didact but there again  went the extra mile and had cutscenes instead of taking the lazy way out with plain text.,HaloStory,cwqn2ay,1,t5_2vomh
5596765,0,t3_3rs6tl,Can I have both? Im sorry I like many gamers am a bit entitled and want everything DSeriously though I do love the terminals especially once they started telling a visual story. just please stop launching it in Halo channel! But I really liked the sheer volume of intel items and that they present the opportunity to give us a much larger variety of lore info because they arent nailed down to telling a single story.I think the perfect mix for Halo  would be just as many intel items with little tidbits of info scattered throughout all the maps giving all kinds of different details from around the universe. Alongside the intel items should be a single terminal every level or so that tells a single cohesive story that parallels the game in some way and can serve to tell some detailed specifics that will support the story like Halo s terminals about the HumanForerunner war and the flood. I think halo  was missing that. They should have had a terminal story about the domain and the mantel to help players understand the story more.,HaloStory,cwqtynq,23,t5_2vomh

6058340,0,t3_3yidd9,I am guessing that like a lot of things in the future much of ship construction would be automated. UNSC ships probably less so just because humans are constantly innovating. I would say that the first ship in the class would be largely bespoke to iron out new technology. Once the first ship is completed and tested much of the construction process would be automated with human supervision. The Covenant ships are largely unchanged for the last  years. This would make them easy to produce in huge numbers. I would imagine that at the height of the Covenant most ship production was carried out by engineers drones  and whatever automated processes the Covenant shipyards employed directly supervised by one or two others. I would say that from what information we have about it the Covenant was out producing the UNSC by at least  to  and probably more. The UNSC did not even begin to come close in terms of ships produced until after the war.  The Infinity is a poor example overall but illustrates the bespoke prototype idea pretty well.  I believe it was said that the UNSC spent  or  years building the Infinity. Unfortunately because of the cost in materials alone she is the only one of her class and will be for some time.  Since the war has ended they have used what they had learned building the Infinity to produce other ships like the Autumn class ships.  While they are not as large or advanced as the Infinity itself they are a huge improvement over any ship produced during the Covenant war. As for the color of the Covenant ships I believe it was stated in one of the books that the purple is mostly a byproduct of how they produce the metal the ships are constructed with.  I would have to dig back through the books to find the source on that though. ,HaloStory,cydqtcb,26,t5_2vomh

6381564,0,t1_czezax3,A  turn  going in the opposite direction.  Maybe a bit much to describe Halseys sudden personality shift but you get the point.You describe Nylunds Halsey perfectly.  She is a morally grey woman doing what she believes is right and necessary to protect the UNSC and Humanity as a species.  She is slightly sociopathic believing that she is the only one who can do what is necessary.  This is shown in all the media up to Kilo .  In Glasslands she suddenly is fighting everyone and her motivations change from trying to do the right thing for Humanity to doing things because she can and therefore might as well.She had always cared and tried to protect her Spartans and in GoO she even starts to care for the Spartan s and wants to try and help Lucy fix her speech problem.  In Kilo  she is now fighting and antagonising them all the time even antagonising the s at points.  Suddenly she is fighting with Mendez with whom throughout the  programme they had a very good professional relationship.  In Glasslands they are always at each others throats projecting their sins and moral problems on each other.There are points where Traviss writes Halsey well you mentioned the crying when alone.  There are points where Halsey acts completely opposite of how she was only days before in GoO.  As for Vaz wanting to execute her having only met her for  minutes that was way OTT.  Mendez completely changes Lucy and Tom act very differently Fred acts a bit strangely at times.  All established characters that change in Glasslands.

7192816,0,t3_4dyf29,Something struck me as you were talking about how many cutscenes H vs H had and how  was more character and dialog driven.Halo is an Actionbased FPS right? So why does so much action take place in cutscene? All of the action bits should be in gameplay and the dialog should be left for cutscenes. Thats how just about every Halo has done it before. You have all the cool action pieces and fight scenes happen within gameplay so the player feels like a badass super soldier and you get all of the explanations and character development in the cinematics.It seems they went backwards with this. Instead of the dialogcharacter driven cutscenes of before the cutscenes turned into the action pieces and the dialogcharacter development was done in gameplay. I know people really enjoy how meridian station and Alliance played out but the main objective ignoring intel witch in my opinion is the only reason these levels can barely get a pass of the missions are the kind of thing that should really be in a cinematic.The reason I always looked forward to watching cinematics in Halo  and  was to get the bigger picture. The story within missions is there but theyre always about the mission. Oh theres a AA gun preventing Hood from entering Covenant airspace The Storm Halo  we need to destroy it.

7369834,0,t1_d2ft43b,Well shes assuming the Mantle of Responsibility the code by which the PrecursorsForerunners lived.I did a bit of digging to see if there was anything more specific about the Mantle but so far what we know is disappointingly vague with the exception of a few notes I could findgt the Mantle allowed competition and conflict as long as this did not threaten biodiversity in the galaxy.So basically we can fight amongst ourselves not other species and only if its smallscale what is considered smallscale Im not sure perhaps as long as the conflict is contained to a single planet? since the Guardians are designed to police solar systems as a whole. This implies a greater level of freedom than the microlevel security idea. Also I just really cant imagine there would be any benefit to the Created to interfere with daytoday lives because theyre not mortal they have no need for resources or money. Also they already control a huge amount of human life already. Even before the HumanCovenant war there were AIs designed to handle the infrastructure and agriculture for entire planets.gt The Mantle also dictated Forerunners lives on a personal level. According to their view of the Mantle the eating of the flesh of unfortunates was forbidden hence the Forerunners abstained from eating meat. The Mantle also included strict rules prohibiting suicide.Now forbidding people from eating meat is a violation of a personal freedom. I guess so is forbidding suicide but our society already does that anyway. BUT Im unsure on this one as it seems to state that only the Forerunners were forbidden from eating meat not the many species that they held under the Mantle. In which case that rule would be redundant now as AI do not eat at all.Overall its hard to say exactly how wed be affected by the Createds rule and in fact thats kind of the problem. We are told so very little about what their plan is that months after the games release we are forced to speculate and assume. For now I support the Createds rule over the galaxy but I swear to god if they try to take burgers and bacon away from me they will need more than guardians to stop me.,HaloStory,d2fwdlc,1,t5_2vomh

If she can activate Guardians all across the Galaxy why cant she control the Prometheans? I have no doubt Warden serves as a commander figure but Cortana displayed power to overrule him. You also say they attacked those who posed a threat but how much of a threat did Meridian militiamen pose to her? What threat did Meridian Stations residents pose to her? Osiris was a threat but Meridian was under attack well before they showed up.. Yet having a slave army of machines undercuts her claims of how bad humans are for enslaving AIs. Certainly Cortana has the ability to free them from their pained existence? Ever notice the Knight in Exuberants zoo? It clutched its head it tries to break free it looks miserable. Even Crawlers show some sign of selfawareness. We cant be certain how much of a person still resides in a Knight but Cortana has no problem forcing them to kill regardless. She is pulling the same sin she decries humanity for committing.. The Forerunners tight control on sentient life left that life prime targets for the Flood. When the Forerunners were the only effective resistance against the Flood and could no longer protect anybody they abandoned whole civilizations. Cortana seems to be a bit better but shell still use other beings as tribute forces like the Forerunners did. Its almost Covenantstyle rule.. Except the Didact would later state that composition would come for any species who opposes the rule of the Forerunners once humanity was totally composed in Silentium. Cortana says that any who oppose her will burned and reshaped in her address to the Galaxy why would she limit it to humans?. Sloan seemed on her side the moment he agreed to let Blue Team land on Meridian. . You do remember that multiple colonies at the start were hit right?

With the sword you can breach doors with a swing with the hammer you can literally bludgeon your way into enemy fortifications. You can cause a huge amount of material damage in the right context with a secondary weapon. Elites even dual wield these things with Plasma Rifles.  Force multiplyer a couple zealots engage marines as the firefight ensues and a cloaked elite flanks and appears amongst the Marines? What happens? Theres almost no way the Marines could win that engagement without casualties. Moreover Brutes charge your position and the Chieftains armor lasts longer than the magazine of your MAB...then what? Pull your pistol? Ceremonial purposes one thing for your commander to join you battle its another thing to have him charge the enemy with a white hot energy sword and tear shit up. Your lance would go mad with morale.  All of the above factor into intimidation an energy sword or hammer just personifies what happens when its CQC with the Covenant. Hows the squad gonna react when you see a Zealot jump into your trench and cleave the LT in half. Not everyone is a hardened ODST or a nighinfallible Spartan.

What does that have to do with the discrepancy between John and Wills taken damage?gtI think the automatic firing mode is what was supposed to be portrayed in Onyx.The way its described would lead me to think its the fuel rod variant. The narration when Fred gets hit claims that that hit wouldve taken out their dropship so clearly it was quite powerful.gtSettings for the fuel rod canon havent actually been made canon to my knowledge though.Why wouldnt they be canon? gtWill kicks one hunter causing it to have to regain its balancehence the staggering. He then dodged a shield strike by one of them and punched another through the already bruised midsectionbruised by Lindas sniper shot.He started by tackling it first sending them tumbling down the stairs. gtIts also fair to point out the the novel puts heavy emphasis on punching through bruised Hunter flesh by italicizing the word through.gtSo i dont think its much different from the FUD in many respects. Especially when you consider that Chief punched through and unbruised midsection reinforcing the Mark IVs strength enhancements being the same.Shoving a grenade into a colony of squishy worms is completely different from knocking around a beast that weighs over  tons.

It fucks up every form of media when the people writing the stories change races to please the audience.Reach was a great game because it had a diverse cast of characters and even a female spartan. It would have been horrible if they were all rewritten as white guys to please a mostly white audience. Their characters just wouldnt sync together as well as the story was more fitting with the race and gender combination they had. The point? The writers picked the best race and gender combination and to pander to any race would of fucked it up.And no I am no white supremacist to give an exampleIf a game was made with an all black cast I would be upset if it was switched to white on release.And Im no sexist either if they made taylor croft a white guy Id be pissed off again.

The stuff with Keyes which gave him more depth McKay Silva and Zuka really showed there was more going on in the story. We also got some more in depth look into John who was a vessel in the game. An example of this being him being pretty freaked out in the Library by the Flood. We dont get this in the game but after reading the novel it gives him more depth. If they were to do this probably never gonna happen btw I would not have them focus on the action the games do that very well. I do agree that not to focus on the fighting as much but drama. I would have the novel be more character driven. An example of this being in Halo  John isnt given much to do. I would love to see whats going on in his head especially when he has to leave Cortana behind. Another thing I wouldve loved to have seen more Miranda during those events.

If and when i manages to get their shit together I could easily see a character focused tale being told alongside the epic conflict that the Created have brought to the table.As for peripheral media like the Kilo trilogy I would argue that it was mostly meant to build up context for the setting as of Halo s beginning. But Halo  itself presented an enormous new threat in the form of the Prometheans and made it clear that said threat would be the main focus for the near future. And considering the reality that as a gaming franchise Halos central stories are mostly going to be told in the main games I dont think the threats and focuses built up in the secondary media are going to be treated as anything but well secondary issues in comparison. So with all due respect I dont believe the Reclaimer Saga was realistically going to do anything but get bigger after Halo . ,HaloStory,db4carw,10,t5_2vomh
9951780,0,t1_db3slpx,gtAt the end of the day the biggest reason why Halo isnt a massive scifi universe like Star wars is the simple fact that it got started as a video game.And therein lies the entirety of my post.Also please note I did mention the extended universe in my post near the end. You can reference ONI the Spartan programs moral standing within the UNSC or the subjugation of artificial intelligence as tidy and neat metanarratives to compliment Halos more overt story mechanics. However I see those not as impactful side threads but more extended universe fodder. Events characters and stories used not in a meaningful way within the games themselves but as a catalyst to sell a product. The meat of a metanarrative must be present in the seminal and original work. Otherwise it serves little to no purpose other than consumable mass.These things should not be relegated to extended lore and there was a very specific reason I left the novels out of the picture when writing this article.

9996084,0,t1_dbafqmr,Actually John stated that Fred came in second at everything in competition. He also theorized that Fred could actually have been number  at everything he just didnt want the attention so he dialed back a little bit. That being said being number  or  in training doesnt often correlate to being number  or  in the real world. The mind is a fickle thing just because you are the second best sniper in target practice doesnt even imply that youd be the second best sniper in the field. Also given that Fred prefers CQC its entirely possible that hes just out of practice for sniping in . Its been  years since he had training and used a sniper on a regular basis skills like that dont just stick with you for decades if you dont constantly practice. Regardless its all kind of irrelevant in any context because Linda is by far the best sniper weve seen in the entire Halo universe. She can drop multiple targets that are travelling roughly kph in such rapid succession that A spartan with a reaction time of roughly ms who was closely watching it happen couldnt even tell which targets were hit in what order. Who cares whos second best theyre nowhere near that level of sniping perfection anyway.,HaloStory,dbaio2x,7,t5_2vomh

10633021,0,t1_ddcop8x,gtI think its a very good example considering that it goes directly against his philosophy on canon precedence. Clearly they did not value newer books as inherently more canon whatever he may say.How can they not? Staten was law back then for plot. And remember theres nothing stopping them from retconning a retcon if they dont like it. Johnsons flood immunity for example flopped back and forth a few times. That doesnt mean that each retcon isnt of the highest priority upon its release. A retcon comes out it becomes highest canon then they simply decided to retcon the retcon and the newest material is now highest canon. Same with the Encyclopedia. They released it it retconned previous lore but theres nothing stopping them from releasing newer content that retcons the Encyclopedia or releasing a new Encyclopedia. Imagine if later canon doesnt take precedence! That would mean that Encyclopedia is still valid even now!gtAs I stated at the end of that point it only got made because of the original discrepancies. Theres no way for them to make an official clarification beyond making a newer edition of the book. They can release a clarification on their forum but that reaches a mite less of an audience. Indeed having to resort to forum post for every clarification doesnt reflect well on the product either.Which is why its good that more recent stuff takes precedence! They dont have to rely on clarifying their mistakes on forums they simply release newer content and any contradictions are automatically ruled in favor of the newer release.gtDo me a solid and take a quick look at the Encyclopedias subtitle. We can give these books these titles but that doesnt inherently give them grounds to assume authority if the discrepancy is there at all. As such I stick to a policy of actually just waiting for clarification. You dont have to agree with me but I also dont agree with your reasoning on this point. I feel like weve made this abundantly clear to each other though.Again Staten already clarified Bungies official policy on content canon. You want official clarification and he GAVE IT. At what point are you willing to accept that Encyclopedia was canon during the time it was newest? Does Staten have to actually release a separate statement specifically talking about the Encyclopedias canon status upon release? Im honestly not trying to be meanspirited but I just dont see how it can get more clear than their content guy explicitly outlining how they treat canon.gtIts contradicting information from Catalogs perspective. Catalogs own information comes from the Ecumene. Neither Catalog nor the Ecumene at large hold any absolute authority on the matter. The ecumene and Gravemind statements stand against each other this point has been touched on before. Id prefer that we dont run around in circles.Thats not correct. Catalogs do not judge they simply catalog. If Catalog is talking about deliberate contradictions then it must be internal contradictions rather than contradictions with his knowledge  its not his job to evaluate whether a witness statement is true or not. You can even see this in the interview of Faber. Faber clearly lies out of his ass and Catalog just takes it all down. For a Catalog to be like lol wtf bullshit its gotta be some really really sketchy stuff.On top of that Catalog doesnt actually have anything to check the Graveminds testimony against. He has no way to corroborate the Gravemind from the Forerunners knowledge becausegtI am pulled from my carapace all but severed from system and memoryAt the point of him calling out the Gravemind hes just a naked dude without any access to the Juridicial network or even his ancilla to help him recall memories which Forerunners rely extensively on. Theres nothing for him to check the Graveminds testimony against so once more when hes talking about deliberate contradictions it can only be internal contradictions and not external.Plus you can even TELL that the Graveminds logicplague statements are internally inconsistent. Just read them. The author is purposely making Gravemind say contradicting stuff so that theres no doubt hes lying. A few examplesgtTheir law includes the necessity of violating the very nature of law?????andgtPrecursor hatred of Forerunners is central to establishing motive.Yet Catalog is a Forerunner andgtThe Gravemind studies me loves me so intensely it will eat me absorb me into its very center.Plus it doesnt absorb him at all it actually releases him.Yea the author makes it crystal clear that Primordial is just lying out of his ass at this point.

11060397,0,t1_deln7kf,It seems bizarre that they coincided with and were peers of the Forerunners only to be  years later substantially behind the Forerunners technologically and seemingly base all their tech on recovered Forerunner items. I have to assume they were deevolved by the Forerunners as well in order to explain their standing in .Well no.. Nothing like that ever happened to the Sanshyuum. Youre forgetting a pretty big event.. The firing of the Halo Array. The Sanshyuum that were preserved on the Ark thanks to the Conservation Measure eventually lost all memory of their former civilization over the successive generations that were born and died there.  During the hundreds of years spent on the Ark the Sanshyuum were taken care of and controlled by the surviving Forerunners but were not permitted to have any contact with them prior to  million of them being reseeded on Janjur Qom.I know a lot can happen in  years but I assume they would have records from that time period and evidence of their past on colonized worldsIn  BCE there were still stone reliefs on Janjur Qom showing humans. However the Sanshyuum living then had interpreted them as mythological beings conceived of by ancients of their species. At that time also regions of the planet were still bearing scars from the carnage the Master Builder wreaked their millennia previously. Why you would expect any modern Sanshyuum to be able to arrive at the knowledge of the past alliance with humanity is beyond me especially given what ostensibly happened to Janjur Qom in  BCE. Also the only colonized worlds the Sanshyuum had before the Array was fired were one other planet in their home system and the moons of that planet and Janjur Qom.Seriously dude. Read these books. Literally all of these questions will be answered in so much more detail than I can give here. Halo has grown up while youve been away. The deep lore behind the series has had a million times more thought put into it than it did in the s.

11070157,0,t1_delivb3,With the  year plan for Halo its not out of the question that  could devote a decade or more to the serious indepth development of a new extragalactic species. Personally I think given that the Primordial stated that it destroyed entire galaxies before and given the fact that it took the flood less than a thousand years to conquer the Milky Way all while it was mysteriously absent from the MW for around  years before that perhaps this unknown species comes from a Galaxy that was overrun by the Flood. The array firing was an event of epic proportions so its not hard to fathom that civilizations in distant galaxies were able to observe it given sufficient technology so perhaps they came to investigate andor flee the flood in their own galaxy. That could potentially do several good things for the story.  it would give us a potential new ally against the flood and seeing as how humanity in  is absolutely no match for the flood as seen during the end of the ecumene the only believable way I could see them beating the Flood would be to gain the help of some Forerunnerorbetter kind of civilization.

11288271,0,t1_dfanp9y,I still take the words of the novels over any pictures from a comic or video interpretation. Halsey also stated that she would do everything in her power to ensure that the augmentations had the lowest risk possible so she would have made sure there was no real chance for growth after the final bone augmentation.Another thing I mentioned in another post was Mjolnir. We know that a suit of Mk IV cost an absurd amount and we know that they had to be tailor made to a Spartan. If they were still growing after augmentations theyd have been throwing suits of Mjolnir out every few months which we know the UNSC could not have afforded. Not only that but we know that John had his first suit of Mjolnir for a few decades so even if he did grow postaugmentation he only grew for a couple months before he was completely full size in every way. This would also imply that he did not grow any substantial amount after augmentation or he would have had his bones warped or pulverized. Another thing to mention is the fact that while you bring up how the description of the bone augs does say may that was theoretical before the augmentations were done. We know now for a fact that it did in fact cause bone pulverization in the Spartans who experienced bone growth spurts like Serin.Also another one to throw out there for Spartan height is naomi. Mal or Vaz stated that out of armor she had to be around . meters tall making her one of if not the tallest Spartan from what weve actually seen in the lore.,HaloStory,dfbicfe,1,t5_2vomh

Hes used to it and he remarks on it that he has to push any of those feelings down so that he can completely effectively continue to do his duty. John is not one to let adversity shake him. No good could possibly come from him letting this Cortana business truly effect him so he just pushed it aside like he always does. The only thing that him sifting through his feelings could possibly do would be reducing his combat effectiveness and you have to remember he is a killing machine. Thats what he was made for and nothing else. He was indoctrinated to ignore any feelings that could jeopardize his duty so he will never let those things drag him down.John started thinking for himself long ago. He always had a lot of leeway in his missions. Now hes just more sure of himself. Him running off in H is not some evidence of his change its evidence of his need to fulfill his duty and he you and I all know that if anyone else had gone after Cortana we would still have no idea what shes really trying to do. It had to be John and he knew that so he ignored his orders as he has done before when they conflict with his duty.,HaloStory,dfbmce0,2,t5_2vomh

Johns bio readings are  and Cortanas chart cant go all the way to  due to the limitations of Excel  this but was fixed in Excel  but Cortanas never received that OTA update due to being stranded on the Forward Unto Dawn.  The irony of Halo  is that John is searching for his humanity but by the end of the game he literally doesnt have any. This is why John appears so pale in the legendary ending. ,HaloStory,dfm0ec1,7,t5_2vomh

11424474,0,t1_dfqx463,gtthe kind there is between Spartans and normal humans for example it wouldnt have mattered.Except Elites get shot all of the time by humans. Whereas unarmored Spartans can reliably dodge enemy fire based on trajectory at the very least.gtAnd Thel was wearing a Majors Combat HarnessI was unaware the basic infantry harnesses varied beyond color and configuration to distinguish rank and shield strength.gtHe was not nearly invisible Jonah had just taken out the Elites active camo with a plasma pistol and despite the secondary chameleon camo could see him well enough to make out etched detailing and other unique features on the Elites armor. Jonah then specifically attributes the Elites speed as to why he missed most of his shots.Fair enough.gtMy point is that this undeniably establishes that Silent Shadows gt SPI Spartans in physical capabilities in the same manner if not necessarily to the same degree as MJOLNIR Spartans gt SPI Spartans.This is excruciatingly diminished by the fact that MJOLNIR Spartans are straight up better by such an absurd degree they arent anywhere near comparable unless certain things were changed retroactively.gtFor plasma projectiles yes but there are also instances of Elites easily deflecting Light Rifle shots from numerous Armigers at point blank continuous fire from around a dozen Drones many of which had Needle Rifles at point blank and stalemating a Prelate who had himself deflected a hypersonic Carbine round from a decent distance away admittedly earlier in the novel. And who was specifically labeled by Joseph Staten as someone capable of beating a Spartan in single combat as it happens.gtFor the second feat in particular the sheer volume of incoming fire and relative ease with which it was performed also makes it much more impressive than the round velocity of the Drones weapons would imply by itself. Ditto for the two Elites who defeated dozens of Armigers in Hunters in the Dark if any significant fraction of them had ranged weapons.I will have to concede to this if thats the case. I was unaware.gtAnd Halo  shows us that SpartansIVs are physically on par with the other classes in the latest MJOLNIR iteration and thus superior to the users of previous iterations unless they all agreed to a major downgrade in switching to GEN. Generally speaking since theres individual variability and outliers in specific areas for all of the aforementioned parties.Theres some pretty bad examples of the abilities of SpartanIVs in Halo  as well. Buck almost died because he couldnt pull himself up even with thrusters...I dont think that games choreography was very well thought out in respect to the canonical abilities of Spartans.,HaloStory,dfqyb2o,1,t5_2vomh

Maybe its the nostalgia but I really do feel that some of the other narrators mainly Euan Morton had so much more of ability to differentiate between the different characters and give them their own personalities. No two characters narrated by him sound even remotely alike. Say what you like about the K trilogy but Euan Morton is the main reason Ive listened to the whole trilogy multiple times. ,HaloStory,dg625jm,1,t5_2vomh

11683293,0,t1_dgk486r,Yeah I get that Id just be a fulltime chef though instead of being a warrior with a hobby so maybe dishonorable is not the word but it just wouldnt garner a lot of respect from those actually serving in the military. I dont doubt Sangheili culture already has some fulltime chefs but its unlikely theyd be working for the Covenant or the Swords more likely a civilian thing so I reckon theres a niche market there providing fresh hot cooked meals to the Swords troops in exchange for protection.I mean hell if I got really lucky and worked hard at studying the available flora and fauna I could even work wonders for Sangheili cuisine. We know that things like agriculture were a serious problem for the Sangheili in the immediate years after the dissolution of the Covenant because the Covenant were the ones that provided them with food and technology. So it wouldnt be surprising if their food lacked a little panache.I could be the Sangheili equivalent of Gordon Ramsay. UungoyWellington Kentucky Fried KigYar Caramelised YanMe LekgoloDogs and the classic Moa Burger. I could yell things at aspiring Sangheili! This Uungoy is so raw its still trying to run away from the fucking plate!Overcooked?
