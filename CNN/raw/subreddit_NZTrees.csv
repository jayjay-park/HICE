6691716,0,t3_475g9s,Funny reading this as growing up in Otago and smoking everything from nzs finest to the backyard ruff I really disagree. I can confidently say nz has some really high quality weed but after travelling to the states and visiting all the finest rec shops I have to say we have a long way to come. I have no way of knowing what you smoked and who grew it but there is no way you can say the weed density and the way it looked or smelled is better over here. I was smoking some  chem dog that would put me out off one hit I dont know why people like smoking this as its way too strong. After hanging with a northern California grower and learning about his process he specializes in the cookie strains some of the best weed around right now I really respect how much time and resources they put into the cannabis world. So when you say they over process it that doesnt make sense they are growing the highest quality in the world. You can look it up the U.S. is way ahead of everyone in marijuana cultivating and producing the highest thc content. Not trying to bash you just had to express what I experienced.,NZTrees,d0bhd3w,8,t5_2sxou

7852494,0,t1_d3yhlct,There are a few ways to tell.  Pinch the stalk or side of the cap and check the colour of the bruising it should be a blueish green colour also make sure the undamaged stalks are white avoid all brown stalks.    The younger ones caps should feel wet and slimy kinda like a dogs nose. the gills will be a light brown colour when they are young turning chocolatey brown as they mature.  If you find larger mature ones with a flat cap best thing to do is to remove the stem place it flat on an A piece of paper cover it with a cup or something and leave it overnight the spore print it leaves should be a dark brown  deep purple colour  If they look like those in the picture have all those characteristics and you find them growing from woodchips they should be good.

Dont stand around in a very obvious circle in a back alley or carpark or what have you. Dont carry your stash  only hold what youre smoking right then so you can flick it away quickly and deny all knowledge leave your stash in your bag at the gig or something if you can. That way if you get searched youre good to go.,NZTrees,d58tt54,2,t5_2sxou
