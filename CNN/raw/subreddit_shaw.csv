2703772,0,t1_cnbe3nf,I cant cite my actual source but Rogers website shows an outline of their fiber network. All the telcos actually run through that line going west from Calgary. As you can see theres a redundant link further north but it was running into congestion issues and certain things such as sections of video on demand could not operate via the redundancy.,shaw,cnbepzh,1,t5_2raj7

2911600,0,t1_cnz0ivq,How do they deal with peak times is it much worse for the lightspeed lastmile users? Currently with shaw during evenings at this time speeds fluctuates and more noticeable in online games that makes you want to flip the table.,shaw,cnz21ua,1,t5_2raj7

5105786,0,t1_cv1fptx,I will say though these problems started when we switched the router. The internet was decent before but it would always randomly cut out for minutes on a daily basis so we replaced the router and now the majority of problems happen with my computers connection.,shaw,cv1frt4,1,t5_2raj7
5907873,0,t1_cxs1zvg,Hey uTheSkeltor Our customers are free to use their own modems as long as its on the approved list. If you have any questions or concerns please let us know by either replying to this message or giving us a call at .Thank you Joseph,shaw,cxu1zob,3,t5_2raj7
6003697,0,t1_cy6aigb,Thanks for the reply! I just posted it to the community. We will see what they say. ,shaw,cy6m57m,3,t5_2raj7
6082910,0,t3_3yu7iq,Are you testing it wirelessly?  If so when you reset the modem the wifi channel reverted back to auto which is just the first channel that works.  Try going into your modem settings ... and trying each wireless channel  to see what works best.  The username and password to access the advanced router settings are on the sticker on the modem.,shaw,cygy8we,3,t5_2raj7
6683922,0,t1_d0an6rx,Yeah mine ended up taking about  but the lady on the phone told me that normally its instant. She said it can take up to an hour with shaw emails in some cases,shaw,d0aockq,0,t5_2raj7
7113704,0,t1_d1mq85f,well yeah I knew that. Was just looking for some advice first. Wasnt sure if I had to call or could just walk in to the kiosk at the mall etc. I dont particularly like talking to people on the phone. Used to work at a call centre myself and it brings back horrible memories lol,shaw,d1mqfja,1,t5_2raj7
8045101,0,t1_d4kadgn,I dont have a modem anymore. Only a router. And I didnt buy it from a shop a guy from Shaw came and changed it.,shaw,d4kcgbb,0,t5_2raj7

10410927,0,t1_dccmjzi,Calling it a design issue is stretching it a little bit.  There are many factors that have to be planned into a network.  Those include capital costs which have to be recovered.    Sure you can plan a network where every sub can get  gbps down.  You can plan a network where there is no over subscription so each customer is guaranteed to get that speed.   The problem is that the consumer market simply doesnt want to pay for it.  They want to pay their . a month or less.  And when thats the case something has to be given up.   This is the key.  The compromise for the combination of fast speeds and low pricing is an agreement with the provider that you wont use it  of the time.  So thinking about this logically how can a provider enforce that scenario.  a they can limit speeds.  Okay but theyre factoring competition and advertising into the picture they want you as a client so they offer faster speeds. b They can offer timed access.  With package A you can access the internet at these times.    This isnt going to fly with anyone..... cThey can measure the usage and put into place guidelines for reasonable usage on a per plan basis.  if all plans were forced to be unlimited you would see far higher pricing.  The goal of a company is to attract customers.  Customers buy based on price.  If its too high they dont buy.  So the option is to restrict service as a compromise.  ,shaw,dco59va,2,t5_2raj7
10891713,0,t1_de37zzh,Ahhh interesting. It seems like it wont connect to servers. Without revealing any personally identifiable information roughly where are you located? West coast? Alberta? Trying to narrow down potential routing issues.,shaw,de3eim3,1,t5_2raj7
11171159,0,t1_dey6k1m,Which ingest server are you using? Does this happen on other servers? Try lowering your bitratw and see if it spikes alot. ,shaw,dey8lz1,1,t5_2raj7
11270676,0,t1_dcyzwl9,the meraki routers they use for the hotspots do have the ability to track what devices have connected and when how much data they use and signal strength while connected live. they probably have the ability for more but given the cost involved why bother?,shaw,df9ijah,1,t5_2raj7
11630250,0,t1_dge74pu,I also have tried other DNS servers and the problem still exists. The only workaround Ive found is using a VPN. Id like to know whats going on too... this isnt universal there are shaw customers who arent having this issue and their tech support is swearing up and down that theyre not doing this purposefully. Not that I trust them but it seems to me if they were doing it on purpose it would be affecting everybody.,shaw,dgeauzb,3,t5_2raj7
