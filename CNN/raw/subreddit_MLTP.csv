1109762,0,t1_chubhml,okaywell first of all you have to recognize that this isnt a small change. This is a giant change that goes counter to basically everything that is currently set up.Lets say an mLTP team wins promotion. Do these mLTP guys get to automatically play majors in the next season? If not then what was the point of being promoted if they might then just play minors again. This means that mLTP teams would then need separate captains meaning that you wouldnt want mLTP teams affiliated with MLTP teams at the beginning anyway since you could even have an mLTP team playing in a relegation match again their parent MLTP team. Thus you now must find an extra odd captains.Do relegated MLTP guys have to automatically play minors the next season? If not then what was the point of being relegated if they can just go back and play Majors again next season.Based on these scenarios it appears that for relegationpromotion to be meaningful the teams would have to remain largely intact. Thus the idea of the redraft most of your team system that is currently in place would basically die for relegationpromotion to be meaningful why lead a team to promotion if you wont get to play for the team in the higher levels.The change from mLTP to NLTP is similar with the added complications of demoted mLTP captains being forcibly introduced into a different league with some different rules.Its doable... but it requires. Making mLTP into its own separate league Finding captains for all the new mLTP teams Heavily restricting team turnover,MLTP,chufs0h,1,t5_2xb0e

2052018,0,t1_ckzv06m,Hope Im not too late to the party here but I was just talking about a potential idea I had that was very similar to what PM said above.  Heres what I wrote a few days agogt Make it into much more of a farm system and restructure the league similar to baseball where each MLTP team gets its own minors team novice team maybe team below that etc similar to AgtAAgtAAAgtMLB. Each team only has six or so players probably more for novice but they could call up anyone from the leagues below it if they need a fillin for the week. The different levels can opt to practice together if they wish this will help a lot with the development of the lowerlevel players and higherlevel teams will want to help because those players could be on there team if they become good enough. The teams will also be much more of a dynasty where the draft is really only used to take new players into the lowest level to replace players that disappear or retire. There are obviously a lot of kinks that would have to be established and its much more complicated that the system there is now but hey its an idea.And a later post...gt Yeah I think my idea has the teams less together. They all still have separate coaches and schedule their own practices and games but they are just connected in that they could practice together if they want and theyre each part of the same franchise in which they receive their players from one another. Maybe each franchise can have its own GM or something that keeps the different levels unified and decides on the draft and when players move updown.gt I think the system would be much more complex and theres a chance it would just involve too many moving parts to function well in this community. The redraft method we have now takes a lot of time every season but is probably much simpler to implement than having multiple connected league. It would all depend on how competent the league commissioners  captains  GMs are as to whether that method would work. Unfortunately it would take multiple seasons to test out so it might just be too risky to try with TagPro.gt Theres also the fear that one franchise will become too talented and just dominate every league for many years. Sports leagues avoid this because they have salary caps and such but since we dont play our players it would be difficult to limit franchises that are much more wellrun than others.,MLTP,cl0nnra,2,t5_2xb0e

2371006,0,t1_cm48tvz,Seriously dude? You dont think that speculating about what wouldve happened last season had you not had a player on your team called up is baloney? Do you want to speculate what could have happened this NLTP season without mLTP callups or if a certain free agency signup hadnt been fudged? No you dont  because its an absolutely pointless road to go down. I get that you feel the need to defend your team from the naysayers in this thread but you sorta came out of the blue putting down DST. gtYou also probably would have lost two more in the regular season had JJZ not accepted a minors callup and perhaps may not have won the Nuper Ball at all. Seriously? We may not have won the Nuper Ball?Id suggest looking at all the callups from NLTP season  and pondering how the games in which Saunuklear Bombs got their  wins and  ties might have gone differently  sounds pretty ridiculous right? Ballys comment about assuming a single player even one as good as Jay would have been the difference is pretty on point. Your speculation and comparisons are even worse than everyone in S NLTP clamoring over which division was better  you were there too. After seeing such a pointless argument drag on for an entire season how can you start a debate even more unfounded?You concede this gt Agreed on the talent level issue. It is impossible to say if the seasons were equal or not.but still think any of your speculation is legitimate?I dont know what youre getting at by saying we treated our respective regular seasons differently but thats pretty obvious when you consider the different roster situations between season  and season . There is absolutely no denying the superior cap differential of your Merballs in their playoff run  pretty impressive and pretty incomparable to any other teams playoff run in competitive tagpro. You were in both NLTP seasons so Ill take your word for the competition being pretty equivalent all I know is that I watched a lot of good tapgro and some atrocious tagpro all season long and in the playoffs. Theres no definitive point to be had in comparing stats from different competition on different maps completely different teams in completely different seasons.So yeah... I think pretty much every point you attempt to make about our respective teams or seasons or wondering what couldashouldawoulda is pretty unfounded and just about the definition of baloney.

3218958,0,t1_covmjus,See I dont think its that much of a defensive map and Im not just saying that because of the games this week. If you have two good offensive players that can get each other grabs then its not extremely difficult to get out of base. I think the biggest thing is that its not a chasey map so while its not impossible to grab its also not easy for the offense to hold forever or hide somewhere. It sort of speeds up the game in my mind because it can kind of force you towards your base in hopes of capping.    I really like the gate though. It can completely change the momentum of the game with the right amount of teamwork and leads to some really interesting strategies with both offenders and defenders on the button.,MLTP,covnb33,6,t5_2xb0e

This was the first time Ive seen you make a post stating otherwise.Sure and I would be totally open to changing the name of the award to better match the intent of the award  but Ive never been able to think of something that truly fits what it is without being overly silly.gt This goes hand in hand with my not responding to criticism comment. When people seem to have trouble with your actions your response is often if they dont like it then theyll just veto it.Your suggestion is the most severe suggestion there is  to step down from a position I was elected to with seemingly zero pressure from the captains.  Of course I am going to reject that notion.Give me actual suggestions about things that can be improved about the league and I would be happy to consider them if they have merit.  Ill argue them with you to try and make sure the issue is a strong one and can hold up to criticism but like I said above  almost every change that has ever happened in MLTP has been because I have led the change.  Very very few of the changes in our league have been made because I personally had an idea and decided to initiate it  almost all of them are based on someone suggesting it first.I mean hell every season we go through an entirely democratic process to make new rules where the captains have full authority over suggesting and approving rules and I lead that process and make sure the entire thing is done democratically and that everyone has an equal voice.  Even when I have had the opportunity to singlehandled write the rules I diminish my power by my own will and allow subgroups to work out the rules beforehand.,MLTP,cq29o30,2,t5_2xb0e

4300989,0,t1_csaehjy,I know youre probably baiting me but maybe youre asking in earnest.  If thats the case  I think the leadership makes a lot of decisions hastily and with strange interpretations.  I really do believe the captains should do the bulk of the decisionmaking.  While Ive seen commissioners claim the captains do Im not convinced thats the case.  Now that Im in modmail I havent seen evidence of it.  Maybe I will at some point.  Its hard not to make personal attacks out of the other main problem I see but Ill try.  I think some of the commissionersRC members are very pleased with the power they have over the community.  They thus sway the direction of the league more than I find appropriate.  Again I wish I could not make this seem like a personal attack but I have no other way to say it.  I think leadership of the league should change fairly often.  The same commissionersRC members should not remain for    seasons at a time.   seasons at most.  And if Im being entirely honest I think that would be appropriate for you PrivateMajor.  Youve been in control of this league for a very long time.  Whether or not one agrees with your positions I think its healthy for the game to have turnover in its leadership.  I think that would ensure that no one person has too much power over the league.  Someone said to me PM does too much for the league to step down.  Like the person or not I dont think thats a healthy way to have it.  Same thing with something like mltp.info.  Relying too heavily on one person is a recipe for problems.  The leadership structure should be more fluid and should flow through the captains.,MLTP,csag2dn,5,t5_2xb0e

Thing is you have minors players that you can and should move to Majors if you need players. So top teams should be mostly using their minors squad. The worse teams can use all the help they can get. If they feel NLTP players can provide that help they should get priority in reaching out. Then you can arrange the eligibility around that. If the st waiver team makes an offer and its rejected then that player cant get picked up until the next waiver period perhaps every  or  weeks?  I dunno I just thought this up just now. ,MLTP,ctoda6q,3,t5_2xb0e
4711512,0,t1_ctodk60,gt the NLTP captains fell like one vote short of vetoing the script whitelist That was not dramatic. There was a good conversation a pretty mature exchange of views.

We didnt know that until PK and chelsea explained that was the case and even then it wasnt  clear as they politely avoided putting responsibility on the developers.I still think its a pretty bad system thats destined to fail spectacularly in the near future but when the facts are laid out clearly  the whitelist system is for all intents and purposes being imposed by the developers  its clear that were deciding between two bad options and I dont blame anyone for going with the whitelist over zero cheat detection.I think the key difference is that a lot of the drama you pointed out involves only the captains.,MLTP,ctofatt,2,t5_2xb0e

Because mistakes were made.There are a lot of people with incomplete information talking about things here.More than anything I saw a ton of internet rage from random people in amp outside of MLTP drum up a significant amount of pressure on captains amp commissioners to overturn the decision. Also whos to say that the captains didnt make the mistake in their revote? Are they more wellversed in bot detection methodsare they more techsavvy than the commissioners? Did they really have enough of the evidence? The CRC at the time acted based on information from the devs  people like Lucky amp Ankh  who are the most reliable people in this community so honestly Id trust them to have better info and therefore make more informed decisions than anybody around.Oh and to be more ontopic about not going about it the right way its more than that. Its seeing how somebody reacts when they dont get their way and if theyre fit for working in a group. Somebody who makes a dramatic meltdown post and ditches their position of responsibility because they disagree with the rest of the committee is clearly not reliable in a group setup.

4744829,0,t1_ctsm8au,gtwhen theyre not selected to play in the leagueIm not suggesting that everyone should get to play MLTP or anything and I agree that MLTP should be the best players.  But improving LTP is about producing engagement within the whole community not just building hype for the elite league.gtThats whats NLTP is forSo its okay if we have  players on our teams?Ill say this NLTP is the lifeblood of the community not MLTP.  Because its a much larger league with more active players and its far easier for a new player to get exposure teaching and good games there.One of the problems we face in all leagues is a shortage of really good captains.  People who are willing to consistently set practice times and actually show up interact with all of their team members and keep them engaged handle all the administrative stuff that goes with this volunteer league and inspire their players to show up every time and play their best.  The main reason I decided to be an NLTP captain this season is because Ive had bad experiences in past seasons and it really screwed up my TagPro career.  I wanted to help pay it forward for other people who deserve better.In MLTP its potentially worse because being a skilled MLTPlevel player is an unwritten but fairly obvious requirement.  The best players dont always make the best captains though there are obviously exceptions.  Improving that and improving the league structures is way more important than building hype imo.,MLTP,ctsmpis,2,t5_2xb0e

Thats really what it boils down to. The difference is that we disagree whether MLTP can still strive toward these ideas while upholding the competitive structure. A further difference is that youre contributing in a very big way to the negativity with the way you approach these discussions. In the space of this one post which as your posts go is fairly tame youve directly or indirectly called me not worth your time deluded and a dick. Guess what Drukqs?

If you have a situation where half the teams are already numerically eliminated which will be very likely considering the doubledivision games unless everybody ties you get a VERY boring end of the season.

5061443,0,t1_cuw2olw,gt Only if you allow teams to trade snake draft positions for coins right? You can easily curb this by banning it. If this is what you are referring to theres an even greater issue in that people could easily trade mid round picks for higher opening round picks if it was all snake draft.Teams can and often do spend their whole budget on their MLTP players and it hurts their ability to get high quality mLTP players.  Some teams might save  of their budget for the mLTP players some might save .You can get rid of this problem though by having the auction only last for the MLTP picks and then moving to snake for the mLTP picks or give a new pot of auction money for the mLTP side of things.  Right now the auction brings you to  players  MLTP and  mLTP.Muddling both MLTP and mLTP picks with the same budget lets some teams make different priorities instead of equally valuing both teams.,MLTP,cuw3frj,3,t5_2xb0e

Granted the two Leagues operate together on quite a few issues but although MLTP definitely needs to have all of competitive TagPro in mind when we make these choices whats best for MLTP should be the first and foremost concern of the MLTP Captains and CRC.IF people absolutely need for both of the Leagues to be  in sync on schedule structure team count rules regulations etc. then we dont need two sets of Commissioners two separate Rules Committees two sets of Captains. It is extremely inefficient if both of the Leagues have to sign off on every decision the other makes.TLDR  Both Leagues should be independent from each other operating at arms length. IF it is determined that everything needs to be identical then we just need to go ahead and collapse it all under MLTP.,MLTP,cv66xo2,1,t5_2xb0e

7061434,0,t1_d1gq11g,I never said to prioritize a honeybearlike captains in and of itself. I used honeybear as the extreme example of someone who was completely dedicated to their team but would be at the end of the skill list of captains. And I only said that we should look to that type of captain over someone who is only a good drafterplayer a captain who wont be active to practice  help minors and that would be only in a situation where there arent applicants who are both good players and good captains. I am saying that the league would be a better league for the present qualitydisciplined minors teams a higher likelihood of content creators given more active players on MumbleReddit and the future the next wave of talent would be more likely to prosper if every team was active.There are going to be good teams each and every season even if we picked the  shittiest TagPro players to be captains. Some teams will be good and some teams will be bad. Having a good team especially just a good majors team doesnt make for a good captain. If I was on the CRC I would much rather have Chaz back as a captain next season than GriefSeeds assuming he would be back and want to captain again or even Stalin. Chaz would be on the lower end of the list of captains in terms of skill but he is super active and knows how to run a team I know he had some issues with his minors team this season but I dont think that was his fault. Grief would be on the high end of skill but showed a complete lack of awareness in how to run a team. Stalin while not the best player is a fine player but he was essentially inactive this season. Sure Stalins majors team has a solid record but his team was literally never online throughout the week heck theyre barely online for games. Multiple people on KGB would come and practice with my team to stay sharp because their team did nothing all season. Its not good for the league andor its community to have teams that are essentially black holes except for game days. If you think that Dyson added more to the leaguecommunity this season both for the present and the future than Bad News Balls did last season I would strongly disagree. ,MLTP,d1grvy2,5,t5_2xb0e

7066259,0,t1_d1h63si,I realize that many decisions will at the very least heavily influence the rest of North American League TagPro. Sometimes forcing their hands with things like length of season time between draft and week one and how many people are in MLTP.  At the same time recognizing what may be best for MLTP might not be best for NLTP. Weve already seen differences in play off structure number of maps played per week and map selection.I do think there needs to be more communication between leagues unless it has gotten a lot better recently. My understanding is other leagues have their people in MLTP modmail and MLTP has therirpeople in other leagues modmail.  Im not sure what else needs to be done if Other Leagues are getting all the information the captains have. I guess it wouldnt hurt to have a couple meetings pre season between MLTP and other league commissioners. ,MLTP,d1hbmua,2,t5_2xb0e

7257153,0,t1_d232sji,I dont know what they mean when they say they cant play pi. I cant grasp the concept mainly because I CAN play pi. What does it mean to not be able to play on a server? Constant lag? Unstable ping? Or is it just that radius is preferred over pi to them?Reasons I askI can also play radius but by play I mean hope that my ping doesnt unexpectedly double or triple at random points throughout the game and cause me to lag. Its playable but its not a condition I would play with.I have never heard complaints about pi. This is probably my lack of problems with pi and lack of searching for other people with problems on pi.,MLTP,d2334q2,3,t5_2xb0e
7257439,0,t1_d232r2k,Almost everyone on that list is from Canada or Europe. Since there are always a shit ton of Radius teams theres zero incentive for them to report that their Pi ping is any good.

7323889,0,t1_d2an7md,gtI would like for you to back up this assertion with actual examples.This is a minefield.  Youre asking me to name the names of the bad captains of the past and justify why they are bad.  I wont do that...even at the expense of weakening my point I just dont think its a good idea to shit on anyone in this thread.  Ill generalize in saying that weve had more than a few captains who fit the following profile and Ill let the audience decide who it does or does not apply to Successful player due to above average technical skill Drafts their friends because they would rather make their team a social club than a competitive team.  Or alternatively doesnt scout or research players and drafts from the Big Board.  Or doesnt even show up for the draft and lets someone else draft their team. Doesnt schedule regular practices take care of stats schedule games promptly or do any of the administrative things consistently which are basic requirements of the job Doesnt teach anything the only kind of practicing they do are scrims and the captain rarely offers any constructive criticism or new ideas.  Merely plays Tagpro with their friends and whatever happens in the game happens. Quits midseason or gets removed from captaincy due to their behavior or choices.I will say it again being good at playing Tagpro has almost nothing to do with being good at captaining coaching administrating or leading.  Instead of asking me to back up that rhetorical point with examples I think the burden of proof is on you to substantiate why being a majorslevel player correlates with any of the things I just listed.  Ive observed that some of the best players in the game have the least motivation or the worst attitude  perhaps because theyre so talented they havent had to work for respect in the community or perhaps because theyve played for a while and lost their fire.  Im not saying a negative correlation exists between mechanical skill and captaining ability  Im simply saying that I see no basis for a positive correlation.Its easy to provide examples of great captains who have been great players but that doesnt support your point because its moot.  Up until very recently it was impossible for an MLTP team to be successful without their captain being a topflight player because NPCs didnt exist.gt Similarly a Captain thats not had consistent successful seasons although its not necessarily his own doing its more likely than the alternative.I completely agree if all other things are equal.  So in other words if an MLTP captain consistently had bad seasons before now I would probably increasingly have confidence in the prediction that they will have another bad season next time.  However the differences between MLTP and NLTP captainship are nontrivial and I outlined why above.  Given that were talking about NPCs who would only have NLTP captainship as a credential Im pointing out the importance of factoring in subjective evaluations of their intangible qualities  such as aptitude ideas motivation etc  because their NLTP captainship experience may or may not provide as complete of a picture as one would like.  YMMV.To kind of complete this conversation  I think the main area where we disagree is about whether or not past success as a player has a large bearing on qualifications for MLTP captainship.  I dont think its particularly relevant and given a new environment in which NPCs exist I dont think anyone has actually substantiated why its relevant at all.  If the CRC selects captains who understand the game put in the effort and treat the privilege of captaincy with enough respect to coach and train their players to the utmost of their ability were miles ahead of an environment where captains are chosen because they can juke and snipe well.,MLTP,d2aocbg,1,t5_2xb0e

In a competitive league once we acquiesce to any form of cheating e.g. audio cheating is fine but at least they dont have overlays the competitive integrity of the league is damaged.  Furthermore I refuse to believe that switching texture packs massively hinders the experience for noncheaters. Now micless players we are trying to find a solution for.  Players that need remaps we are close to a solution for them although programs like sharpkeys will auto remap your keys.  These are the hindrances that leadership can work with.  But a slightly changing visual is not a complaint that is worth bringing down a leagues competitive integrity. ,MLTP,d3zl2qt,4,t5_2xb0e

You give an extra week between sign up ends to the draft for people to scout.Top talent doesnt need scouting nearly as much as hidden talent.

9257642,0,t1_d8pfm64,gt If centra captains are not building their strategy around sphereballing then theyre doing themselves a disservice based on the team distribution.You are overblowing the ping advantage relative to the skill gap. The sphere talent pool is very shallow. Only one available sphere player who has signed up lukemoo has MLTP experience. A few others spjork team hark have mLTP experience. They all have better or equal origin ping than centra ping and lukemoo lists centra as unplayable.If sphere was loaded with talent this would be a legitimate concern. As it stands there are many centra players Id take ahead of those sphere players on sphere. And many more Id take above the other sphere signups. There will not be more than a few sphere players on centra teams this season same as in the past.EDIT forgot lukemoos a captain.,MLTP,d8ph17u,4,t5_2xb0e

10203778,0,t1_dbzv0zm,Since no one has answered you yet Pablo Picassbro.Here are some things I dont like about jjpoole as a candidate.  He has banned people from region wars for dislikingfeeling slighted by them.  He tried  unsuccessful vetoes to increase ban lengths. He tried to get Protag and Legman punished potentially from the Superball for smurfing in his Allstar game. The same Allstar game where jjpoole arbitrarily decided not to add Protag as an alternate despite adding an alternate for minors because he doesnt like Protag.  He didnt change the Western Allstar ballot when the updated stats came in despite my messaging him about how a week of missing stats would change  or more people on the ballot. Conspiracy theorists say that its because then more Centra players would have made it but who knows.  He handled the minors allstar game very poorly although to be fair many of the Western players also didnt handle the situation ideally. He has a past of being antagonistic i.e. was a big reason Fatal and Raven quit many of the Centra players dislike him due to some of his abrasive comments on the subreddit and he repeatedly moved Protag and Gem out of his channels for no apparent reason other than I dont like them so why should I have to deal with them.Edit I was misinformed about some stuff. Protag and Gem had a history with jj i wasnt aware about and he didnt necessarily want Legman and Protag suspended in the Superball just punished. ,MLTP,dc0nlpt,14,t5_2xb0e
10207549,0,t1_dc0rxqh,Despite you claiming that I unbanned you the day before RW      times now that is completely false. HERE you are being told on October th that you are not banned. RW was on the nd of October. Maybe you mean that I informed you that you were not banned which is not the same thing as unbanning because you were never banned the day before signups closed. But thats not the same thing as the day before RW. And that would have also left you the ability to sign up for RW before signups closed should you have chosen to. So dont be so dramatic.gt The fact is I was banned and you admit it in a message to the MLTP CRC modmail which you can dig up if you get elected.This is also not true at all. HERE is a comment from PM saying that the CRC never had a list.

With a  team league having  Centra teams puts those teams at a disadvantage due to the lack of returning talent. However two Centra teams would stack talent and give those Centra teams a decent sized advantage.With a  team league  Centra teams would strike a nice balance and would mean more players getting to play for their preferred server since as the season currently stands Centra teams are going to be forced to draft eastern players to fill out their roster in order to be competitive. I know that eastern players would rather not be drafted to a Centra team so a  team league makes sense from a server balance standpoint.,MLTP,ddykcyr,9,t5_2xb0e

In this case the th pick really wasnt much compensation to replace a captain and potential majors allstar but it makes sense qualitatively for Dokes value.This was kinda a different situation because there was no implication Fatal would quit and I think he quit because of what other captains did to him not because he refused to play minors and anyone that talked to him knew it. The bigger problem with this comparison is that Fatal was the captain. His team would be punished for nothing they could control. Drafting on the other hand is very controllable.The jubs thing was also stupid hold the captains accountable.,MLTP,df0hvuu,10,t5_2xb0e

11382705,0,t3_62foyy,If you legalize make the bot like a pizza slice where each pizza slice is th of the skill level of an MLTP player. So at exactly  slices before the bot spawns th of the pizza is filled in  slices   of the pizza etc...This would add a little more strategy to maps like Pilot. For instance when you see that first pizza slice fill in on the middle bot and it was a shitty bot you could decide to leave it and go fight for one of the bottom bots in hopes of getting a better bot NLTP or MLTP.,MLTP,dfm7kzn,8,t5_2xb0e
11534823,0,t3_64n6ty,I would also like to point out that I have no affiliation with renegade and have maybe spoken to him twice ever.I also want to point out that the rules werent even published until a few days before the first games were played.,MLTP,dg3h3bs,9,t5_2xb0e
11536979,0,t1_dg3ppwb,As far as I know if they did not get drafted to an NLTP team then yes they would be ineligible.  It sounds unfair at face value but I think the original intent was to keep players from tanking their draft stock and manipulating to get on the team they want in Free Agency. It could probably be a better rule though.,MLTP,dg3pvyq,1,t5_2xb0e
