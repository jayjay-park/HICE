345923,0,t3_1y016k,So I happen to wake up at am and decide to head down to the start line.Place is swarming with cops. Then I remember Boston.My goal then becomes to not get arrested.I am riding the sidewalk of blocked off streets to get to the start line at  and see nothing but cops and a few marathon event organizers. I am phrasing in my head what Im going to say to the police if I am stopped. A couple cops on motorcycles pass by me as I get back onto the sidewalk after a brief ride on the marathon path past the start line.,BikingATX,cfgmgt8,3,t5_2s26g
591165,0,t1_cg6ugbo,Not a threadjack at all i was going to post the same thing.frankenbike is usually vintage stuff and heavily used parts but there are some pretty good deals and occasionally more modern components.  Typically therell be some spd components and stuff maybe some  speed but dont count on seeing the latest and greatest or  wheel sets.  Haggling is definitely the order of the day.,BikingATX,cg7gwhs,2,t5_2s26g

1035230,0,t3_25ymmj,Assuming you want to avoid high traffic  high speed limit roads Yaupon would work as long as you access it from the Great Hills area rather than Spicewood Springs.  I really like climbs in the Cat Mountain area  Far West Ladera Norte and Mesa are all tough climbs with moderate traffic.  East or West of Mesa I like even better since there is even less traffic.  Examples are Mt Bonnell North of  Lookout Mountain Mountain Villa Mountainclimb etc.,BikingATX,chlyl9x,8,t5_2s26g

1893468,0,t1_ckh9rbm,gt but I know Rockets prices amp sort of suspect you might be lowballing yourself.I dont think so.  This is a Walmart bike though the picture given suggests that they got the wrong model and Rocket probably sells better quality bikes.The price is probably reasonable as well but not a STEAL as claimed given that its only been ridden twice.  Its pretty sad when you do the math and each ride cost  but thats the way it is ... shes not likely to get too much more for it.  That said Id still expect some dickering on the final price.,BikingATX,ckhcqkm,1,t5_2s26g
1916528,0,t1_ckjnf88,gt  Id probably picked up something in the  miles Id already covered that worked its way through the sidewallIf it did itll still be there unless you find it and remove it.  So if you didnt find it and arent getting more flats ... that probably wasnt it.Now if its something that cuts all the way in in an instant  that may not still be there.  But if its something that works its way in over time it will almost certainly still be there and will probably give you another flat unless you find it.,BikingATX,ckk4nc1,1,t5_2s26g
1953940,0,t3_2h0for,Spent a lot of time on Craigslist looking for my bike. Based on components from what I can tell I think youre good for at least  minimum. Start higher. Not familiar with the company or model so do your research but generally if you looking to find a higher bidder itll take a lot longer to sell,BikingATX,ckoniiu,3,t5_2s26g
2091495,0,t1_cl5o6oz,Cow Creek is nice. I havent been on all the roads in the balcones but the ones I have been on have all been great. Like Lime Creek most of the roads around the lake and the balcones have rollers visible from gmaps.,BikingATX,cl5ob5c,1,t5_2s26g

8585015,0,t3_4x8k7d,Just drove to the airport this morning and kept an eye out. Literally no shoulder going with the traffic on  and its  mph for cars. Love the new live oak but I like living more. Maybe salmoning up the other side is slightly safer but that seems unsafe too. ,BikingATX,d6eppr4,2,t5_2s26g
8650680,0,t3_4ydhjy,I would take Shoal Creek. Its much more pleasant and has a big bike lane. Then take something over to guad or duval whichever you prefer. Although guad is a bit sketchier its faster in my experience.,BikingATX,d6my512,3,t5_2s26g
