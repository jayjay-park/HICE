2981098,0,t1_co6nqzk,Sort of. The laptop died about  of the way through the movie first losing picture but keeping sound somehow for the epic hero suitup montage. Then the movie was off for about  minutes while they tried to get it running on another machine.Once they got the movie cued up on the other machine also what I can only guess was an ailing laptop for reasons Ill explain later they were trying to find where the movie left off and literally skipped forward right into the part where you find out who the masked villain is.Did I mention this was my first time watching BH?So after a chorus of boos and ironic clapping they finally got the film back to where it was only to have it stutter and skip a little bit every few minutes through the rest of the movie.And they skipped the part after the credits. would not attend another UTA movie night. I should have waited a week or however long to get it out of redbox and had a nice evening at home where I didnt get totally spoiled or have to deal with the emotional roller coaster of ineptitude and bad computers.,utarlington,co6ysvc,3,t5_2sgzg

7123253,0,t1_d1ntr3a,Not personally I have talked to Spurlock about it though. To be frank physics  are pretty similar in terms of difficulty. Physics  is much harder than  though. As calculus actually does play a big role in  many of the equations biot savart ie maxwells equations. Im taking calculus  right now as well and would have wished to have waited til calculus  since a lot of the problems we solve are  dimensional.  If youre taking physics  during the spring you may be left with straddling Aldridge Mayfield as options. Out of those  Id chose straddling.
