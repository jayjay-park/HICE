1042773,0,t1_chm3llf,Best tutorials are found by googling something like rusted metal effect in photoshop at least thats how I do it. First you gotta familiarise yourself with how PS layer effects and blending works thats the hard part. Then learn some basic tricks have no fear experimenting and dont forget textures every surface needs one. For colour Id recommend Kuler helps you build harmonic colour schemes so your colours dont look out of place.Font are chosen by two major criteria  topic i.e. dont put western font in a scifi setting and readability build your UI textures first choose fonts after. Also no fancy fonts in long blocks of text makes them hard to read.As for general UI design layouts and such it comes with experience. Learn from the best play strategies and RPGs preferably by Blizzard and Firaxis.,gamedevscreens,chmtga9,2,t5_317gk

7382640,0,t3_4ggi28,Well yeah it is programmer artish. But you can help to make it look better with a few things.Art CC Shade your objects. Youre just going from light on the edges to dark on the inside and with no texture to the objects or having texture and no lighting for the cracked walls. Ease off of the heavy black outline for your tiles and objects. Outline your objects if desired and leave unoutlined your background objects. This isnt a hard and fast rule per se but rather just a tip to help you keep in mind that you want to draw the eye to objects that do move  are interactable. Also be consistent  your well in the picture isnt outlined but other objects are. Your player isnt either.Now to actually use the art you have effectively Fix the tiling you have on the bottommost layers of rock that dark gray ramp where the tiles meet horizontally. Dont use that tile indiscriminately like that where you just copy and paste eight layers down just use it once and fade it out to black or another dark color. Color your hero in a way to make him stand out. Gray character in front of a gray background makes him hard to see. If you find that this is a lot of art to do youre right  the resolution youve got for the game is fairly high for a pixelart game. You could bump it down to give yourself less work to do.Just a few tips. Keep it up though  dont get discouraged!,gamedevscreens,d2hctxa,3,t5_317gk

I agree I will definitley need some AA on the shadows they are clearly jagged if looking closely. I have a compute shader for antialiasing the fog of war can be seen just a little in the bottom left corner in this image so I would just use that one here too.

That  tap worked a treat those are some pretty schnazzy shadows haha  Thats odd Ill have to give it a shot I was able to use the automagical method that does the optimal sample type per APIplatform.That fog of war is cool but the sharp line could use a little distance blending in my opinion maybe move it out a bit if you need it to be opaque behind and depth blend something like    float alpha  saturatesampleDistance  fogPlaneDist  blendRange    alpha  alphaYou could go linear too I guess Im just a sucker for sqr falloffs haha,gamedevscreens,dcwisyf,1,t5_317gk
