Someone in Los Angeles playing with someone in Taipei who both need to connect to the same server and keep a persistent connection to it just isnt going to work smoothly.

8664510,0,t1_d6onqla,Keep in mind this is a BRAND NEW player. Sure leveling might get boring for us since we have done it a couple of times but remember back to the first time that you leveled. For me it was one of the greatest video game experiences of my life. I dont recommend using the instant  right away until you have at least experienced the leveling experience at least once. That way you can  learn more about what a class role is what gear and stats mean etc. Also this gives you time to play around with different races and classes before you actually stick to one until . All in all just have fun with it man whether its getting sucked into the world and the lore or power leveling its a game. Best of luck! Im at work right now but if you PM I can send you my Battlenet tag and you can add me if you have any questions or want someone to level with! ,Blizzard,d6ookg5,4,t5_2r21e

9561391,0,t3_5bvqfh,Did you understand the concept of random rewards from loot boxes before purchasing? You cant complain when you get bad rewards. Its random.The fact you got the lootbox refunded in the first place is bizarre. That shouldnt have happened. I can blame Blizzard for that. Doesnt matter if its the wrong box or anything.... they shouldnt have refunded you.But your attitude overall is really bad. You buy random rewards then want a refund when its not when you want. Either you cant grasp simple concepts or you are okay with bitching and whining until you get your way. Either way your attitude sucks.The less people like you playing in my team the better. Good riddance like the other comment says.PS. If you are going to complain that  is  days of food for you and its too expensive then you seriously need to rethink what you choose to spend your money on.,Blizzard,d9rmyrv,2,t5_2r21e

Uninstalling software is a de facto update process so it stands to reason that itd fail if the app isnt ableallowed to be executed properly.

11687577,0,t1_dgksgxa,Yeah it is sad what customer service has become in some companies nowadays.Same has happened to me and friends multiple times actually with different games. The best thing is when they ask you for an IDpass which was impossible to do for  of my friends because they work in a government job with confidential information. I also could never supply them with an ID because of that reason but i didnt have to till now.But yeah they have your money and frankly do not care enough since they have enough players. In a few years down the line however when they actually have to compete again e.g. when WoW is gone they will see how far their customer service has gotten them.,Blizzard,dgksz0u,1,t5_2r21e
