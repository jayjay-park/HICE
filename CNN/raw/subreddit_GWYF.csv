10232668,0,t3_5mdbac,Hey Devs.Absolutely love the game. I play with a group of friends at least  to  times a week. Our favourite play options at the moment is to turn jumping and collision on drop the hole timer to  seconds and the pump the penalty up to  shots. It turns the game into a frenzy!I saw you were taking suggestions for the game. Can you make a mode where you can knock people out the cup once theyve putted it so people can swear at uPolyHydra even more?He takes collision ON very seriously.. Could we have a Random  option for course choice once Candyland goes live? Thatd mix up the gameplay quite well.. Along the same lines as . could we have a mirror hole option for the courses which flips them left to right? Kinda like the Extra options on Mario Kart  Thanks for doing the AMA. I look forward to seeing where you take this game.  ,GWYF,dc3xi6o,7,t5_3i0z1
