5685882,0,t3_3szhvr,Maybe go with the rHouseOfCards method. Given that its also a Netflix show where the entire season is available at once its a method thats easier to emulate than one for a network show that airs weekly. Have a general season discussion thread and separate episode threads and the list of links in the sidebar so people can easily click to the thread that is relevant for them where the spoilers can be unmarked and those will be spoilers at your own risk so theres no use bitching.Then any specific subject threads created that have spoilers need to be marked as such for a predetermined amount of time HoC does it until I assume the next season premieres however we dont even know if JJ will get a second season so if the spoiler ban is lifted say Feb.   that needs to be a sidebar banner that says As of .. spoilers will be unmarked!.,JessicaJones,cx1w05c,3,t5_2z0t7

Every action and word coming out of Jessica Jones mouth seemed to convey the message of Are you kidding me? and Do you even know what you are messing with?.

5750178,0,t1_cx8iyoq,I honestly dont think itd be possible for a person like him to adjust back to society. Hes been like this since he was a kid. You think he stuck around in school to get an education? I doubt he has any useful skills as a human being hes probably not even knowledgeable enough to work an entry level retail or service job.Hed probably just go insane and kill himself or try to kill Jessica. Which wouldnt work that well in a TV show.He was like a rabid animal. There was no saving him. You can only put down an animal like that. He doesnt have any sort of normal human psyche. At the end he was still convinced he never raped anyone. Hes just a fundamentally broken human being. Best outcome for all involved is to just put him down.The only ends I saw for him were either him dying or getting away to haunt Jessica again some day possibly with another injury like how he had to replace his kidneys but otherwise still being powered.,JessicaJones,cx9v5te,10,t5_2z0t7

5764946,0,t1_cxb7ven,Heres some reason why i feel the story of jj went downhill towards the end Attempts at making hooks into the next season should have started since the earlier episodes. It feels like they are just shoving in loose plot for a sequel only towards the last  episodes making it abrupt and sticking out like an eyesore Kilgrave just stops being scary. Before the containment arc kilgrave was scary as fuck. Then it slows down and give you an insight to kilgraves point of view in the living together arc making him human. However being betrayed by the only thing he has been obsessed with and tortured by the fact didnt turn him scarier but merely turned him into a typical villian who wanted more power. Sure it was to fufill his desire of controlling jessica but he no longer appear to be scary as fuck as he was introduced. Comparing that to DD where fisk continues to appear to be invincible all the way until the last  minutes where they finally cracked him down.. The ending was kind of bland and unsatisfying. I guess this boils down to personal preference but thats basically how i felt at the last episode.,JessicaJones,cxbp0ql,3,t5_2z0t7
5773263,0,t1_cxcnnsi,I think if you can minimally listen or understand kilgrave you take a command. Trishs headphones in the ending seemed to be loud enough to give someone a headache and they covered her ears entirely. So probably she didnt listen to Kilgrave at all. The headphone kid earlier seemed to be playing on a much softer volume and on smaller headphones. Plus she was looking right at Kilgrave being like a foot away. ,JessicaJones,cxcq6h0,6,t5_2z0t7

5819154,0,t1_cxhyr41,Ill have to agree with that comment. While Broadchurch was good and both Tennant and Coleman were amazing in it the writing was just bad at times. Great actors mediocre writing. Half of the time it just felt like they didnt know what to do so they added new suspects which ultimately didnt lead to much. It felt a lot life who shows like CSI work where a new suspect comes out theyre cleared after a chat. Also come charactersactors were terribly underused like Arthur Darvill. ,JessicaJones,cxif5ee,-1,t5_2z0t7

So when someone says cross the street! you think about drawing a cross on the street then its fine. But if your mind knows what he meant it forces you to do so. In the case of Trish Jessica forced a bullet in her mouth and then told that she did what he asked what convinced her that she technically did what he asked for.

5958130,0,t1_cy0b105,Well to be fair JJ didnt intend for that to happen. But SE js Hogarth decided to cut the wire. Even after that things could have ultimately ended okay had spoilers js Simpson not come in and killed Clemson and burned all the evidence and Robin riling up the Kilgrave Survivors and breaking into JJs apartment to knock her unconscious and setting a tiedup Kilgrave free.It became a case of too many cooks. Yes the easiest and smartest plan is to kill Kilgrave. Jessica could do that no problem. Who else could get close enough to Kilgrave to even do that without a whole lot of collateral damage SE js Note that when she did not a single person in that scene other than Kilgrave died.? Certainly not Simpson. Any plan of his would have not only caused a lot of collateral damage but attract way too much attention. A bomb in a middleclass suburban neighborhood? Like an investigation wasnt going to find that one out.But JJ kills Kilgrave shows over the streets are a little safer but theres an year old girl who had been abducted mind controlled repeatedly raped and forced to murder her own parents and shes the one who will spend a large chunk of her life in prison and even with an eventual release in her late s  early s her life is ruined. The attempt at least needed to be made to just get that tangible proof of what Kilgrave was capable of and fuck JJ had it. But the peanut gallery got all twisted up and viewed JJ as the villain and it all went to shit. As an aside I do wish JJ had pointed out to Kilgraves former chauffeur that he helped destroy his only chance in getting his son back and clearing his own name. Thats the thing. While JJ might have been focused on Hope she was seeing a bigger picture in her own narrow way. How many people are paying for Kilgraves crimes? How many people lost their families their livelihoods their savings accounts their homes?Simpsons move was especially dickish and stupid. He became so insane and shortsighted that he didnt realize that putting Kilgrave into the system meant effectively neutralizing Kilgraves biggest advantage and power he would exist. ,JessicaJones,cy0n3z2,2,t5_2z0t7

6142300,0,t1_cynjhu3,There are a few things that make me think it is interpretation rather than exact adherence to the command.  First he tells Jessica to take care of her which she could have interpreted as literally taking care of her but that wasnt Jessicas interpretation.  The second is Trish putting a bullet in her head.  What he said was put a bullet in your skull.  She was frantic after pulling the trigger and thankfully could adjust what she thought he said in order to get out of it.  The most interesting thing about languages is that he can to some degree read lips.  I wonder why he would need that particular skill?  When did he learn it? Why?      Edit  I just remembered the other thing that makes this up to interpretation When Kilgrave has to clarify to Hogarth that That wasnt a rhetorical question.  His previous command to her was to shut up.  If she had interpreted it as a direct question shed have to answer it right away but she remains silent until he tells her otherwise.,JessicaJones,cyntd03,1,t5_2z0t7
6156644,0,t3_3yopne,Depends if I just obtained the powers recently or if I was born with them. If I woke up and could control minds Id know right from wrong and do my best to help people and save lives with my new abilities. But if I got them at a young age like Kilgrave or if I was simply born with them Id probably be more like Kilgrave perhaps worse. I think many of us would be lying if we said otherwise.
