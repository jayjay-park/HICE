4362414,0,t1_cshb93u,Argument from inductivelybased incredulity. My argument is consistent with human historical behavior. Believing such information would be shared publicly is inconsistent. ,SETI,cshdmp1,1,t5_2qtld
4384053,0,t1_csjiznb,gtWithin the SETI Institute Seth Shostak heads the SETI effort and is the host of Big Picture Science. Dr. David Morrison is the Director of the Carl Sagan Center and Edna DeVore is the Director of Education and Public Outreach.,SETI,csjthrl,1,t5_2qtld
4873540,0,t3_3hmo64,I understand your question but most sources are a little breezy and designed for the average Joe or Jane person who wants to help science but doesnt know or want to know much more than that so there arent a lot of great articles that are specific to your question.As far as the specific information about the patch of sky you are searching etc. I dont think it works that way. I doubt you are processing a raw signal from a telescope. Instead you are processing raw data that may be part of a larger calculation. That is theyre probably just using your CPU for basic instructions and returning data to their server to be reintegrated with their local calculations. Just a guess.That said if you want to know what they are doing with it here is an old but detailed article about how they slice and dice the signal what they look for how it gets processed and sharedIt would be romantic to think of your machine being the one to find the next WOW! signal but your machine is more likely doing a Fourier Transform for some part of the signal or something lower level calculation than that.,SETI,cu8uj4p,5,t5_2qtld

6256964,0,t3_40ycjj,Top question in my mind  could this be an artifact of changes in the photography process or something related to the aging of the older plates ie could the star appear brighter on an older plate due to some chemical process affecting the plate material itself?What happens if other similar stars on the same plates are measured in the same way?  Do the measurements hold constant or might they also show dimming of the same sort?,SETI,cz0ujrt,1,t5_2qtld

8213191,0,t1_d528p02,If it only was so of course to people in media or in alien oriented communities. Its misused on a maddening level even by otherwise decently oriented people in the topic. Youll see it in science magazines even the more tabloid ones. ,SETI,d547bxg,1,t5_2qtld
8832876,0,t1_d74vxxp,Should we question a child for attempting to dig a hole to Australia or for trying to make a ladder to space?Well probably yes because both of these things have potential negative consequences they never thought of. But it is in trying and failing that we understand better why what we are trying is not working.We have been at this for a long while. The first man to try and make a boat most likely got very wet. Remember that.,SETI,d79l669,1,t5_2qtld
10943276,0,t1_de8fwbb,Yeah Ive not explained it very well. When we detect the supernova the idea was that wed then broadcast in the same direction as the light and radio emissions from thr supernova. Then maybe in s of years an alien will see the supernova then whilst their telescopes are pointed at the supernova and earth they would be more likely to see our signal. Our signal would arrive just after they spot the supernova.  ,SETI,de8pzom,2,t5_2qtld
