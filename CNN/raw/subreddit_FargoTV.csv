842362,0,t1_cgzmczu,I dont really see how its harassment. She seems to be the only person really working to solve the murders. Lester was the only person alive at the scene of two very gruesome murders and has no information to offer the police because he had a simple concussion. Obviously he is and should be their prime suspect especially considering how weird he has been acting. In any normal town or city he would have already been formally interrogated. I mean look at the conversation between Molly and her dad. Hes an excop and he thinks the same thing. Lets not forget that the chief was on his way to Lesters house to question him about his involvement with a different murder. And he ends up dead right after? Thats suspicious. As is the manner in which is wife diedhe beat her head to a bloody pulp with a hammer. Thats not some robbery gone bad thats personal and angry shit. And its definitely not consistent with someone who would just knock out the next person to come down the stairs. The sheriff was also shot with Lesters gun right? And the house wasnt ransacked a bit so there is no reason to think it was some drifter breaking into their house? Either the writing is sloppy or this town is just full of the most incompetent police officers of all time and we should probably be less judgmental of the only one trying to do her job. ,FargoTV,ch012cd,3,t5_2y3s5

2672945,0,t1_cn7d2le,Yeah I agree. Molly as someone who really persevered to solve this case and Gus who mustered up courage to do what he did in the end. Same with Hank in breaking bad. He was one badass police officer.  The point I was trying to make was that it was just one little incident that created a huge turning point in the lives of both our antiheroes. With Lester it was that moment when he killed his wife with the hammer that he realized the gravity of the situation and of course he panicked and called Lorne for help. And as it is hed been very jumpy after sam hesss murder at this point. And with Walt it was of course his cancer that ultimately sent him down this path. I know that the paths they went down were not exactly the most moral paths but just couldnt feel sorry for them. And I guess thats life. Sometimes youre dealt a bad hand.

4544085,0,t1_ct3d2lv,First off you shouldnt feel bad about not watching breaking bad were in a golden age of television and its hard to find time to watch all the best shows for instance I still havent got around to House of Cards Mad Men Halt and Catch Fire Turn the final seasons of SoA etc. I love narrative TV and I still havent seen everything I want but like everyone else I cant recommend binge watching Breaking Bad enough.I hope this doesnt spoil too muchSpoilers Toward the end of the series Walt finally admits he did it all for himself. He was lying to everyone when he claimed he had good intentions and basically says I did it for me I liked it I was good at it. So we get to watch this supposed transformation but really it was just an awakening of Walts inner megalomaniac. I dont know if that changes your perspective or not and I hope it doesnt spoil some aspect of the show.EDIT added spoiler tag,FargoTV,ct3epwq,3,t5_2y3s5

The same amount of lines devoted to saying how much of a mystery Hanzee is couldve been put to use elsewhere.  We know hes a mystery.  We are given single line explanations for his motives.  He was adopted.  Okay. how about a vet who did  tours in vietnam and has a purple heart and a bronze star.  Are those not single lines of explanation? Those are necessary but if they dont explore those then theyre lazy.Ive been trying to come up with a reason for his motivations for  weeks. We dont know is simply not good enough.

5886862,0,t1_cxraogc,But we were unprepared for a narrator. Suddenly were just experiencing this through a whole other layer of obfuscation? It makes literary analysis even more muddled. Ive already been given a rational explanation for the UFO from other members in this subreddit that the bright lights were because Lou was being choked out and the liquid dripping from the UFO was from bears sweat and blood.The book framing increases the WTF because the foreshadowing for the aliens were there and it could of been interpreted multiple ways but the book being so out of place removes the audience from an In the moment type of experience during the climatic fight.It kinda weakened the character of hanzee because it gave away his motivation for no reason other than to give away his motivation.  He was vulnerable and they stabbed him so thats why hes trying to kill them. Great thanks for spelling that out. I would much preferred inferring his hatred of them through context clues as opposed to lazy exposition.  It also weakened Mike Milligans character by saying that he killed his executioner before he was executed himself. It was redundant it dumbed down the show and prevented the audience from figuring it out.Edit I dunno Im not downvoting or anything because your point is also legitimate I just dont see this as a very effective use of Lampshade hanging PS yeah I feel like an implied MIB cross over would actually suit the roswell type deal weve got going on in this season.,FargoTV,cxraura,11,t5_2y3s5

So Im not sure I would call it a snubBest actor in a miniseries? Probably not. That category was stacked and Im not even sure Wilson came in second.Best actress in a miniseries? This is probably the only category Fargo should have most definitely won.  But its just an award. It doesnt take away from the greatness of the show.,FargoTV,cz0l56x,2,t5_2y3s5

11699716,0,t3_66saop,Misprints and misunderstandings. Accepting something as fact or bending the truth to make it so. This has been the basis since season . We are shown this  times in the first episode.Im just going to paste what I wrote in another threadIt is all tying back to the language Ted Dansens character suggested at the end of season . This season is about misprints and misunderstandings and the acceptance of those misunderstandings as fact. We are shown this in the intro. When the excon is convinced he carried out the robbery as instructed. When the man says that his company made an investment not a loan. And when the brothers are both believe their version of what transpired with the stamp or have convinced themselves.It is all about connection to the world and how it is perceived and how misplaced value and misunderstandings affect people.The counting scene was implying her character is freakishly connected to the world to the point she can see the language of it. With how the world is portrayed through random acts of violence in Fargo I think this is saying much about her character.The stamp itself has value because it is a misprint. The theme is that money is the new reason for life it is what people live for and often risk their lives for. The excon grabbing the wrong stamps and being convinced they are the right ones has some depth to it. Those stamps are the connection to the murder of Ennis and Im sure will be what solves the case in the end. So the wrong stamps now are tied to the value of a human life and the understanding of the death. The stamps have been given value because of a misprintmisunderstanding and the belief that they had value.Bridge is a great metaphor for all of this.,FargoTV,dgm6jki,9,t5_2y3s5
