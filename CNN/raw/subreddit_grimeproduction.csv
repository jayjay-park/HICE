8312670,0,t1_d5g67v0,Thank you so much for the detailed response this is exactly what I was hoping for  Ive got a few tracks with similar issues to this one ie lack of variance so Im sure I can apply some of what you said across these as well. Im going to be working on this tune today and depending on how far I get Ill update you later or  tomorrow bless up and Im glad you like it ,grimeproduction,d5gn2i0,1,t5_39jsk
8727229,0,t3_4v8yo4,Couple square waves detuned in opposite directions. Could be a sine wave underneath but I cant hear it on my phone speakers. Either way it would be pitched down and just provided spectral content rather than much timbre change. But yeah detune two saw waves by like  cents in opposite directions. Apply some portamento and glide. Bit of attack and short decay high sustain. Some release. Could also apply a chorus to them. Probably not quite there but it think youd be close with that.,grimeproduction,d6wjokv,1,t5_39jsk
