8571343,0,t3_4wwbs7,Most of the people playing out there are great. They are not littering smoking or ripping saplings out of the ground to beat attack other floraas an earlier post claims to have witnessed.The first time we went there to play there was a real problem with driving while Pokmoning so I was glad to see that the park now has signs up asking that people not stop in middle of the road and impede traffic.As for non Pokmon Go people at the park I have had nothing but good experiences. On Tuesday my wife and I were both trying to catch a very stubborn Sheldor and a group of hikers came by. They stopped to see if we had caught anything good told us to have fun and be safe and then continued on their hike.I dont think that the parks are going to be trying to get the stops removed because it is drawing people to the park.

8920297,0,t3_52ght5,IV is important if youre really into getting the absolute strongest of a particular Pokemon but in the case you mentioned the IVs shouldnt matter too much. Move set is more important in many cases as well as dodging as much as possible in a gym battle. Your cp vapenation should be able to beat a  charrednards even if your IVs suck and theirs dont.
