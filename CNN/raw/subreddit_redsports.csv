Id imagine theres plenty of clubs in northern England with that same type of working class fan base and a lot probably fly under the radar for their small size.  Apparently Alex Ferguson participated in some major shipbuilder strikes when he was young.  I dont know if that affected his political leanings much after that but pretty cool.,redsports,dcfhcj5,2,t5_3iive

You might know more than me but didnt a lot of teams with Partizan or Red Star in the name come from military units?,redsports,dcfhq8f,2,t5_3iive
