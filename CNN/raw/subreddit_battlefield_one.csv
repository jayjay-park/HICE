If we look at the Red Baron pack we can see that we get his custom pistol. I have a feeling this means that pilots and tank commanders will only spawn with a pistol and if they need to bail out of their burning vehicle they will be able to defend themselves. Also considering there is no engineer class I have a feeling that pilots and tank commanders may have a wrench of sorts in order to repair their vehicles.

7537584,0,t1_d2yghto,Im a weapons collector and WW enthusiest when it comes to the weapons and vehicles used. I would not call myself a true expert like Othais at CampRsenal or like Ian who runs Forgotten Weapons though I certainly hope to be someday but I know a good amount. Semiauto weapons were beyond rare. Youre talking about guns that there were maybe    of made during the war. They were strictly prototypes and field test models. Conversion kits for bolt action rifles were also tested in low quantities. The problems with semiautomatic weapons revolved around how easily they clogged up in the mud and ceased to function. The weapons produced at that time were simply too unreliable to be mass produced for the trenches. Semiauto rifles did see some good usage in aerial combat in  before the development of the interrupter gear allowed forward mounted machine guns on aircraft. But aside from a number of prototypes and usage in the air semiautomatic weapons were never used in mass numbers. The production numbers make that story clear when you talk about how many rifles were really produced.Germany had . million Mauser s made by the wars end but only had roughly  MPs made and at the front by the wars end in . Germany had ordered more MPs  to be precise but that order was placed in spring . It simply couldnt be fulfilled in time to be of real use in the war.Its the same story for all the other countries. Useful designs either came too late in the war to be of use or lacked the reliability required for trench war or were so complex to make that production simply never got ramped up due to the cost and time it took to make the weapon. It was simply viewed as easier from a logistical perspective to keep making the standard bolt action rifles that each country entered the war with. In many cases those designs were even simplified during the war to make production faster and easier.,battlefield_one,d2yzj0x,14,t5_3eer4

7589702,0,t1_d33zysp,I have an idea why. Take the China Rising DLC pack for example. On the map Dragon pass there is no terrain deformation and the trees and other foliage are indestructible even stopping tanks. People called them out for that bullshit all the time and they wouldnt even fix it. On the other map Guilin Peaks there was suppose to be fog that would come down into the map and make the map become less visible and very foggy. It was even stated by a developer and sound files were found for the levolution just like the rest of the levolution in the China rising maps. That sounds like lazy development. So when something like that happens it leads me to believe that the other reasons for nonexistent destruction within other maps is because of once again lazy development. Im not saying I hate DICE or anything I just wish the game wasnt rushed. Or the game destruction was actually consistent along every map and actually owned up to their talk of having destruction.

Another example of bullet magnetism is shown in this video  .It may be from Halo  but it shows a clear example of what bullet magnetism is.I am fine with them getting rid of snapping and bullet magnetism from BF but I think friction and acceleration should still exist to make the game somewhat playable with a controller.

7724767,0,t1_d3jqxn0,I know I said I wouldnt reply if you did the thing but at the same time you make it so easy to respond.gt Are you kidding me? Do you not grasp the concept of irony? Because this is how you operate to a T.gt Youve constantly just said CONSOLES NEED AIM ASSIST BECAUSE THEY DO.No I have supported my claims with arguments something you frequently dont. And this is specific to Bf not consoles.gt Again this has zero bearing on anything were discussioning but you keep bringing it up as if it proves your points.It does I said why.gt Proof? The game wasnt decided with just the PC in mind and like every single other BF title since BF has sold far more copies on consoles which the developers knew would happen.The game bf was deisgned to work on both PC and console trough the use of aim assist on console. If bf was designed around the use of a controller then they would need to add some sort of anti aim assist on Pc to prevent Pc players from having to much accuracy. Because some guns are balanced around how accurate you need to be to use them effectively e.g. SCARH.And since you missed this part which explains why the game would be less enjoyable without aa SLowdown assist tries to make controllers as precise as a mouse. If that isnt the case then firefights become more random as moving the stick a little to the right makes your sight overshoot the target and the one with the least accurate gun can in fact end up winning. Not very enoyable. One can alleviate this by turning down sensitivity but that makes close quarters less enjoyable as you have the turn time of a semitrailer.gt You could just as easily claim that any of the multiplatform console games that dont have aim assist were also designed for use with a mouse but SURPRISE still dont have aim assist on console.Any other multplayer game without aim assist probably doesnt need it like R. Bf does and I have said why.gt No they dont. Slow down is more of a hindrance to a decent player then a help. When youre fighting multiple opponents you will slow down because of the assist when targeting them which is why a majority of them do not use it. It hurts you.Huh my personal experience says having slowdown beats not havng it a long way. because when you kill someone slowdown no longer affects you from that target and you can with more precision transition over to the next. Even when active it doesnt hinder sight movement to a degree it is a hindrance.gt What ? You brought it up. You pretended that everyone has it is a relevant defense for this babymode. Its not btw.LOL You brought it up In fact RBs comp scene is stronger then BFs ever was. Partly BECAUSE there is no babymode aim assist nonsense..gt Again this has no bearing on anything. Why not?gtRB devs realized that it wasnt needed so it wasnt included. The only difference? Dice devs are lazy and did not care about competitive play in any fashion with their game. So of course they didnt give a shit about the massive amounts of aim assist.gt Only later until the community CONTINUED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT did they make a change.Im fairly sure including aim assist takes more work than not. Anyway they fixed that in comp by disallowing snap on.gt I disagree. But I guess I have more faith in the average person then you Probably. In fact I lost quite a bit of it during this exchange.gt This is not true. A lower TTK means accuracy is EVEN MORE IMPORTANT because a single well placed bullet kills. Accuracy is MORE important then it is in games like BF.LOL. So one well placed bullet takes more skill than placing two well placed bullets?gt It really doesnt. ahahha how can you say thisgtAlso Halo has some of the most egregious auto aim of any console game. You dont even need to come close to hitting your  headshots because of bullet magnetism.Not really relevant.gt Ive proven the opposite though. Its vastly more important to have the best accuracy in a game like RB then it is in a game like BF.No you didnt.,battlefield_one,d3k938g,0,t5_3eer4

They were essentially the assault rifles of the th century.Your getting too caught up on history and realisim instead of game balance bolt actions could look like potatoes it wouldnt change my view. gtMaybe they shouldnt be OHK to the body but hey should still be viable in CQC.Except DICE already said Julian Schimek The weapons of Battlefield  are a bit more specialised. To get the most out of them you have to be aware of their strengths and weaknesses and use the right one in the right situation. Putting your weapon to good use will feel more rewarding than ever before.i doubt they will make the BA easy to use close quarters when there strength is accuracy and OHK with a marksman shot.Full auto assault rifles are confirmed submachine guns are confirmed if you want to be more viable in close range use a semi auto or full auto.gtWhat they should do is restrict scopes to Scout but allow everyone to use BAS with iron sights.well as i have said before you will end up with campers using a BA as support just spamming with unlimited ammo the whole game.DICE have made it clear every class will be very well defined infact proof of this in action is the fact you have a pilot and tanker class.by allowing BA to be all kit weapon you end up with people using weapons not suited as there role. Its much more likely semi auto rifles will be all kit ,battlefield_one,d3zet45,1,t5_3eer4

7922392,0,t1_d46jgvc,Im a former tracked vehicle driver. I know how they drive. I drove a vehicle that was roughly  years ahead of the tech of WW and the vehicle I drove did not have any of the agility of the tanks that are shown in WW.The tanks of BF should fill a certain role. Pill boxes rolling through tough to penetrate points with machine guns raking people from either side of the tanks sponsons allowing for infantry to advance. The cannons can take care of other tanks and HE shells could be loaded into the cannons to take out infantry. Taking out a tank could be difficult and would require either arty close range grende bundles an anti tank rifle etc.Instead we have the tanks rolling through villages running people down making hair pin turns blah blah blah. The tanks in this game as shown today are nothing more than reskinned AFVs from BF. Why? Why cant DICE bring something new to the table? Why cant DICE make the WW tank act like a WW tank? Hint hint its not sexy. Not to mention that a tank rolling into a city gets eaten alive pretty much every time it does so unless its heavily supported by infantry. Even in modern combat with tanks with like mm of effective armor against jihadists with simple weapons RPG etc the tanks get in trouble. The English tanks of WW had like mm of armor only stopping small arms with non AP ammo. How do you think that thing would do if it rolled into town? It would basically be on fire as soon as it past the st building.Same with the weapons. Mosin Nagant?  rounds of slow semi well aimed fire? Sounds boring says the CoD BF twich shooter. Give that player a SMG that a minorty of people would of ever seen in that war! Fun fun fun! hold left click down spray that sucker till he drops run around like a chicken with your head cut off and keep on spraying the place with SMG fire.Um ok? Havent we done this a million times in the last decade of gaming?Run and gun run and gun.And then they keep bragging about friggen  man matches?

7981192,0,t3_4oimpv,For BFI think hiding the KD is not needed anymore. I played the game and the incentive to take the objectives is so high with the amout of points you can make out of it that people who play only for the kills will not be rewarded as theyll just stay somewhere in the middle of the scoreboard.If someone has a lot of kills and a lot of points then it means he did very good in terms of objective play and was a solid player when it comes to taking down targets to help his team moving towards objectives.  For OverwatchI think this works with Overwatchs Quick Play but i think it would be great to see everyone stats in the Competitive Play at least at the end of the round with Damages done  Healing  Damages blocked  Kill Participation  Objective time etc....Its hard to compare both games anyways but at the end of the day Battlefield is a FPS game and doing kills is pretty important else im missing the point of the game.

Like killing... you wont win by just killing.gt I just dont see why some of you insist on having a choice over dropping ammo or not doing it.Its not having the choice or not its that adding this thing will completely obliterate the few teamplay there is in BF games.

If you look it up on the internet you will see how common this error is and there is no fix for it... ............................But..............................The only way Ive been able to make that error never pop up on my GTX  in these  past years is by closing everything that isnt related to Battlefield.

Duck behind a rock unspotted. Go into a house unspotted. I thought that this was a good idea or as above the faded spot is a good idea.

8593752,0,t1_d6fdcwy,I do think that back capping is too powerful for how easy you can do it. Using a plane to bail and set up a spawn beacon in bf isnt something that is honorable gameplay. And rewarding it with a vehicle difference of  is totally over the top.As Marble said in his video there are whole squads that are dedicated to back capping because its almost always the most efficient way to severely weaken your enemy. Your team has  to  man less on the frontline while the enemy team has suddenly to split up for two front lines.Id like that back flags take a significantly longer time to take. And the best thing would be that you can only exit planes when they stand still on the ground like almost all pilots did in ww.,battlefield_one,d6ft5s6,1,t5_3eer4

You have to realise that if it would be more realistic it would take from the fun part for a lot of people and at the end of the day this game still needs to be popular buyed in millions of units and it has to make money for EA.I still really hope that its going to be insanely fun because Im so hyped but I dont want to be let down again like when Battlefront or No Mans Sky came out,battlefield_one,d6rpqh4,6,t5_3eer4

8714582,0,t1_d6topcq,Sure! Im interested in actually having a discussion than the oneoff comments that are essentially memes without the picture haha.gtWhat I meant by this is that if the current elites are OP because they have regenerating resources then giving them a way to regen even if it takes teamwork would take us back to square one.Ohhh I understand yes yes. If this is what makes them powerful and potentially unbalanced...then why should we facilitate making that even more powerful? I missed that if when I first read your comment my apologies.gtAlso the game shouldnt facilitate powerful so powerful they become necessary boring roles like that.Yes...there is something about teamwork when it becomes...uninteresting. Its almost which team has more people who are willing to forgo what is likely more fun running around and shooting stuff....for what is more beneficial for the team.gtVehicles are not OP. They are powerful but counterable. Just like Elites will be if correctly tuned. Yes! I agree. I used OP incorrectlycaught up in that trend. I shouldve written powerful without the balance judgement of overpowered. gtHowever incombat repairing needs to go. As it makes the game less about the drivers skill and more about how many people they have looking at their vehicle holding a button same as it was in the scout heli. There was some discussion about incombat repairing on the CTE a while back   if you are interested.Hmm.... think it is a useful mechanic but it is mindless. It would be more interesting if repairing took more skill repairing certain parts of the tank etc..The first CTE post I like most people play engineer a lot. As soon as there are more engineers actively targeting the tank it seems to be pretty balanced. Add in the  rear dmg  critical mobility hit and I feel fairly confident in ving most tanks in public servers. But that rear damage multiplier nor critical mobility hit is ever explained by DICE. I think...if that knowledge was more readily known tanks wouldnt be as powerful as they seem.The same with boats that degree broadside hit is beautiful. Scout helis though dont have that  dmg modifier and they are very mobile so positioning is very difficult if not impossible. Its sheer numbers here. The second CTE post well haha that was a nice transition. I dont see tanks being too powerful though because of the reps. Scout helis were definitely not fun but with land vehicles you have a lot more fun and interesting avenues like the rear damage modifier. Usually if I can get off one of the  to  dmg  critical mobility hits that tank is retreating as soon as it can or a teammate will finish them presuming I cant get the second shot off properly.And tanks in a canyon far away tanks are also weaker if they dont get close enough for us to get an angle on their backside they also will have a proportionately harder time dealing with drop and aiming. And then they have a number of longdistance annoyances lasertargeting mortars UCAVs SRAWs etc.. And then most air vehicles can damage tanks. It seems like a different situation with the hypermobile and alwayseasytorepair scout heli. Hmm....I need to think more.gtIm saying why artificially balance something when you can actually balance it? An analogy could be this We have a gun. It is atm OP should we give it an intended role and make it be outperformed when exposed to certain tactics or should we give it much less ammo? Its about tuning maximum potential vs limiting it.I completely understand now. Just that...we know why it could be overpowered. Just tweak that variable instead of adding another one. gtBy unsmooth I was referring to game flow. Game designers care a lot about it. Its about having the game well flow from instance to instance the player constantly playing the game i.e. making decisions like should I fall back to regen or push. Not having regenerating resources really breaks flow its unsmooth. You know when you run out of ammo and there is no support aroundable to drop ammo? That effectively pauses the game for you you are no longer in control. Same would having to wait for an engineer to fix you. This is the reason health regen is in modern games most anyway some games have different gameplay and might do well without health regen e.g. survival games.Oh I see! But...I wonder. Sometimes I think that constant state of flow is detrimental. I feel like players just through psychology and the fun theyre having...get stuck in one of the flows of the game running and gunning. I feel like there should be some pauses in the flow so players can step back for a moment. Running out of ammo repairing your vehicle even dying all of these in my mind facilitate the crucial OK whew I am not in immediate danger because I needed to extricate myself from that situation. What should I do next? On a map as complex with  players I dont think many people can accurately judge what is the most beneficial decision if they are perpetually flowing from this skirmish to the next. I feel like I spent a fair bit of time just looking at the map judging player density which flags look vulnerable where is our armor vs their armor where can I be that critical one extra player on a flag burn or on a tank v tank battle etc.I think the pauses in the game are useful in that sense. Yes they may be pauses in the fun level....but I think they are thinking pauses. I dont knowthats how I use them or thats how the situation is presented in my mind.I think in a competitive mindset when everyone is already at maximum critical thinking then if everything was replenishable I could see that. But hmm.... I think there are some useful ancillary benefits here.Maybe the most ideal and efficient mechanism add pauses in the game that are directed and scheduled almost i.e. dying and emphasize those instead of all the mini pauses that happen during the game...because are players actually thinking when they play? Or is it...just trying to keep up that constant flow and hope that if everyone keeps up the flow youll have a fun interesting  round and youll win? I dont know...,battlefield_one,d6uyl89,2,t5_3eer4

8787101,0,t1_d741v4w,From this short part that Ive spent in game I got a feeling that switching the classes depending on the situation on the map especially in rush will play much bigger role here than in previous DICE titles. There I could play assaultmedic all day long and do great. I could also play any other class pretty good almost everywhere assault was just the easiest one. But here it feels like there are moments where one class could dictate the terms for few minutes and then situation changes and you actually need to switch class and adapt. Maybe itll change when we unlock every other weapons but theyre rather not too versatile.,battlefield_one,d7427h7,1,t5_3eer4

8790379,0,t3_50j70i,Someone else on these forums was able to verbalize why it works so wellInitially I didnt much like the map too big for my personal taste but then your comment put it into perspective. Really its many separate zones or even different maps sort of stitched together that somehow flow together. Yes theres lots of dunes out there to snipe from but you can take out snipers with vehicles easily. Infantry can be dug into the urban areas around the points but those buildings are destructible and suited to every other class. The rocky outcrops surrounding it all are fantastic for infantry to snipe or hide from vehicles which rule the little valleys in between. I really like it as soon as I understood you simply just need to stick to the environment youre trying to play for. Assault shouldnt be running around in the dunes and Scout probably shouldnt be zipping around in the town for CQB.,battlefield_one,d74h1cg,1,t5_3eer4

8804944,0,t1_d76728w,gtDICE loves it. They invented Conquest. I think Id trust their judgement a little bit more.After playing the beta I disagree. Also Im not trusting any of their judgement on word alone anymore after the shitshow that the BF launch was and how different the game was now than it was at launch. Remember this or basically anything Zhinto did or said? Nearly everything was tweaked and changed once DICE LA and the CTE took over so I dont see how that wouldnt be a possibility for this game as well.gtDICE hasnt touched Conquest since inception. Would they honestly just do it randomly?Yes I think they would. Maybe why they hadnt touched it was because they nailed the formula from the start and it is an iconic gamemode for the BF series. Also DICE doesnt make  of the decisions about the game. EA has a say as well and if they told DICE that they wanted the game to be more accessible then I would imagine they would be obligated to try.gtIn my analysis and in that thread the benefits are massively larger.Well thats in your analysis but in these threads more people feel differently.gtIm not looking to be right or wrong here. I want the system that encourages PTFOs and is fun consistently.You are correct in that there is not necessarily a right or wrong but not very many people are agreeing with your assessment of which game scoring method DICE should go with and think the opposite. You also said this gtI actually really liked the old system. I loved ticket bleed finally a complex and interesting mechanic in an FPS game. I have decent aim I keep a  KDR in most Conquest rounds. But I love the tactical part of ticket bleed. Thats just some fucking tactical gameplay....no doubt. ...Ticket bleed is the MOST important concept in a Conquest game. If these people are actually confusing kills with ticket bleed....that means they dont understand ticket bleed properly right?earlier so you are kind of contradicting yourself. So are you just playing devils advocate because a few people didnt use the phrase ticket bleed in the correct syntax? What the person you are referencing edited and what he actually meant to say still stands just because he fumbled his words doesnt make the meaning behing what he said wrong. ,battlefield_one,d768gx9,1,t5_3eer4

Youd imagine calvary would be some type of higher ranked soldier or ranked officer so an upgraded support load out makes sense.  The sniper also has a iron sighted rifle which damages enemys to the same effect  although the calvary seems to cycle rounds freakishly fast.

8826539,0,t3_512eqo,Agreed! Although Im coming into it from a different perspective. Ive played all the BF games through the years but for some reason never truly got into any of them.  Maybe around  hours average per game  I think I was too young to truly appreciate  as well. This game however might finally be the   hah  that makes a true BF fan out of me. I have a few things that I might want to see improved or changed but at as whole it feels so solid and so much fun to play. I think part of the reason I never fell in love with the others was that I didnt spend enough time in game to truly learn the mapstactics. As this beta is only on one map Ive had no choice but to learn all its ins and outs which adds so much to my enjoyment of the game. I also feel like Ive improved a ton  always felt like I was dogshit at BF . Anyways Im really looking forward to release. Maybe my CSGO addiction will finally chill out a bit. ,battlefield_one,d78tt76,3,t5_3eer4

8827098,0,t3_50zap3,I agree. Spotting accuracy definitely needs to be improved. There are arguments both for and against the spotting lasting longer. I think that targets spotted with the scouts spotting scope should definitely remain spotted for longer  though at the very least for the scout and his squad. By the time you have spotted a few targets gone back to your rifle and stared to line up a shot everything is already unspotted.,battlefield_one,d78w805,1,t5_3eer4

Also will we be able customize the weapons? I just saw different variations of it but didnt see the option to add a grip bayonet sight or stuff like that and thats a deal breaker.

Are you saying the game as it will be released in October is unfinished? I feel that that would need some explanation as it seems there is a whole finished game coming out in October.Based on previous BF games they will continue to work on fixing tweaking generally improving and balancing for multiplayer for years to come at NO additional charge. They support that FREE development work by releasing some new content in a quasi subscription model for those that both appreciate their continued development support and want more of the overall experience they liked from the original release. In this way they can provide a solid and expanding product over the course of a few years rather than  time installments every few years.I do not like to see the online player base dissected and would love for them to attemptinvestigate alternative models that allow for more inclusive online playerbases. For all we know they have and havent found them viable. I find it hard to believe that ANY development based firm hasnt tried to shift the majority of their work to ongoing projects rather than deadline driven releases as the entire industry now has effectively shifted that way.That being said given the option to do it as it is or not have the amount of additional content developed I would choose to have the additional content. ,battlefield_one,d7gbdon,1,t5_3eer4

Base Game.  Deluxe Edition Base game  plus early access and various bullshit non game changing crap.  Ultimate Edition Base game  Plus all DLCIf you want to know what . gets you its the  maps plus the free one in December as far as we can tell. Its been that way for most of BF franchise and unless EA is really looking for some serious backlash it will be the same. probablyIf you want to know what your Ultimate edition at  gets you its the  most likely maps plus the free one in December and probably  maps from each of the  DLC packs. Probably a total of  maps.It would be appreciated if everyone would stop quoting  as if its the base game cost its not.

9000807,0,t1_d7tooht,gtMy biggest issue is that the core mechanic of any FPS namely shooting and killing was somewhat discouraged with the new system. It encourages shuffling around on the periphery capping flags and avoiding combat.I never once avoided combat unless i was greatly out numbered and that applies to BF to this day to skit around and get cap points it still requires you to kill the enemy to get flags how often did you go from flag to flag to flag and not once attack or be attacked if people want to play ring around the flags they are going to die a ton and never get any cap points because guess what yo cant get points when youre dead. Tell me this how many BF games were decided by a plane pilot im guessing not too manyheli pilots maybe planes have roles in BF its called map control and attacking armor I keep hearing people say kills  deaths dont matter but they do if youre dead you cant cap or defend a flag it still requires tactics to move in and take a flag and reviving players still matters the missing revive icon has been fixed for launch they need more points for a revive thats one thing they need to address but you need to revive to have more players to take or defend a flag just like other BF games I will like to see if they dont change the points scoring system and farming kills will not net you MVP if lvlcap amp xfactor have something to say.,battlefield_one,d7tra2h,3,t5_3eer4

Also there are fixed field guns which can deal  damage each time.When tanks first appeared in Battle of Somme it scared the shit of Germans it should be scary in BF as well.

9124105,0,t1_d88hfl9,Nope just speaking with  years of online gaming experience primarily with FPS games. Cheating is an overblown problem for most games. Yes there are a lot of people who cheat  but the chances of playing with cheaters is minimal. Especially if you frequent servers with active admins and games with a reliable enough anticheat.I can say in the past month or two Ive seen one cheater between all the games Ive played and it was guy teleporting around the map in Rust. He got banned by an admin fairly quickly.As a server owner and community leader myself I can tell you that most cheat accusations are salty players getting owned or not understanding how the game works or some sort of lag. The only game where I see a constant stream of cheaters is GTA V where modders arent being banned by Rockstar. Cheating is not the epidemic many people make it out to be.,battlefield_one,d88kh8q,1,t5_3eer4

I dont think we should be rewarded for shitty pilots crashing but for something like that we should be. Ive been spending more time as a pilot and Ive only leveled the class up once. Its slowgoing. I think DICE really missed out on not having a mode where its legit only planes. Kind of like Fighter Squadron in Battlefront.

Empires Edge is really pretty and it reminds me of s Road to Rome expansion but from my experience it seems to favor the Italian side. Maybe its just my bad luck but I feel like I get stomped on every time I play the AustroHungarians on that map.Id say my favorite so far is probably Monte Grappa. The elevation differences coupled with the network of trenches and tunnel systems provides plenty of variety and offers opportunities for many different play styles.

Oh and I have a  GB data cap per month that I share with another person oh and it costs  a month for the total bill.So I can empathize with you and then some.

The slouch hat is dimpled towards the top giving it a tapered look and has a cloth sash wrapped around it that is pinched in the centre.  You cant just put on any felt hat and flip up the side and say its an army uniform slouch hat. The fact is that the lack of detail given to the Australian uniforms in those missions is disappointing. Maybe they werent allowed to properly recreate it because the army didnt authorise them to or something I dont know.But to someone who knows the uniforms well and has a very keen interest in the time period the representation just looks sloppy.,battlefield_one,d913wsy,1,t5_3eer4

Of course it only has a one bullet mag so it needs to be reloaded ever shot.Thats probably what youre experiencing.WW was primarily fought with bolt action sniper rifles.

Though more likely its the spray getting out of control. Majority of the LMGs do way better prone but there are a few that dont suck while running around such as the BAR trench.I assume the reasoning behind making LMG which is a light machine gun do tickle damage per hit is for balance reasons.

That being said gameplaywise I think the spread and damage are both poor.  Damage is fine if they increased the accuracy a bit.

I think it adds to balancing issues and i personally dont see the point in it except it gives people something to work for unlocking them.For the most part the majority of people will gravitate towards the gun that unbalanced and OP in each class. I know that doesnt apply to everyone but it happens a lot.I play games for the gameplay and map design and the strategy.

9418803,0,t1_d99v6ks,.... what campaign? In BF? BF is about World War  there was no Stalin then it was Russian Empire. Also why are we picking out USSR why didnt you say the same about the US? US soldiers did horrible things in Vietnam. Did you somehow assume Im Russian and trying to get to me?Dont justify Nazi German soldiers thats my whole point. I hope that I never face that choice but if I do I hope I choose not to be an animal whatever the outcome would be. If youve already made a choice that you are ok with Nazi atrocities because they were just following orders at least you are not ok with Stalins atrocities  its a fucking pity but Im clearly not making a difference with your opinion. EDIT The reason why most people think its ok to have unequivocal hate for Nazi Germans all of them not just soldiers but not for WW Germany is because in WW they were just a country hungry for power and new territories just like most other participants in WW shitty but human nature. In WW the whole German society was built on the ideas of exterminating Jews Gipsies Slavs Blacks. That whole society is blamed not just the military part of it. ,battlefield_one,d99wcsv,1,t5_3eer4

9422850,0,t3_59pwql,gtIs it safe to buy?tl dr Yes its safe to buy but there are some minor wrinkles that DICE needs to iron out. Nothing that hinders gameplay to the point where its not worth playing though.I would say so. I mean the servers arent having any issues so you can play it without random disconnects or inability to connect at all which is somewhat of a surprise for a Battlefield launch.There arent any major bugs that Im aware of. There are a few minor ones. Spotting is well spotty at best. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt. Sometimes you get the point animation and the enemy isnt actually spotted and you get no audio cue as to what youre pointing at which isnt much use. I spawned in once and could move but couldnt shoot or use any gadgets but a quick trip to the dashboard on PS and back cleared it up. Sometimes hit detection is iffy where youll see hit markers but the enemy doesnt take any damage though thats pretty common in any game like this and it doesnt seem to happen often. Overall its just minor things like that which should be cleared up in a patch or two but dont actually affect gameplay all that much.There seems to be some balance issues that still need to be worked out. About half of people think the support LMGs are terrible and the other half think theyre fine. I personally think they need a small damage buff since I dont think it should take six or more shots to down someone who is standing in front of you. Some people think the cavalry vehicle is overpowered and needs a nerf. Basic things like that which come to light when you release a game like this to so many people.Some changes seem a bit strange coming from other Battlefield games. There isnt a ton of gear to unlock now. Instead weapon addons e.g. sights grips bipods etc are replaced with weapon variants. You might have a standard iron sight sniper rifle then a variant with a few lowpower scopes and another variant with higher power scopes and a bipod for example. Weapon variants are unlocked by leveling your class which is done apparently by playing to your class strengths. Nobody knows for sure how its calculated though. Another change is that battle packs are random. You dont get one just for leveling up. Instead at the end of the match about ten or twelve players are randomly chosen to get a battle pack. Battle pack contents have also changed. Since theres no weapon mods to unlock the battle packs instead just contain a weapon skin of various rarity and the possibility for a puzzle piece. Get all five puzzle pieces and you unlock a melee weapon that can only be had in that way. Theres also an endofround scoring system thats as clear as mud as to what it means exactly and how its calculated. About the only thing thats obvious is a score modifier from . to . I believe which apparently depends on how well your team does overall.,battlefield_one,d9aetc3,2,t5_3eer4
9422890,0,t3_59pzw4,they probably can not unlock them. If you create a party before joining a match with a friend when you join your squad is auto locked and there is  at this time  no option for you to unlock it.So probably not all those peoples fault. Im sure this will get fixed in a patch,battlefield_one,d9aezwl,-10,t5_3eer4
9423088,0,t1_d9abljs, In terms of balancing I was speaking of the one between rounds not just before the end. Regardless  of the time I get placed on a team that gets steamrolled. In BF I could switch back especially if I liked playing with a few other players. In BF the only option is to quit. I wont suffer a team with  hill snipers. Regarding class counter I was thinking of how it is in a tank. Every class now has the antitank armor or a way to damage them. It reduces teamwork if every player can counter each obstacle individually. Theres no need to rely on a squadmate. Granted with a squad of casuals probably wouldnt happen anyways. But its a bit frustrating in a tank when there are suddenly five antitank grenades followed by five more a few seconds later.,battlefield_one,d9afwfj,1,t5_3eer4
9423478,0,t3_59odzq,Ive played  or   of which were attacking and were all wins. The trick is to be in a game where everyone is squadded up and with parties not a bunch of randos running around trying to do their own thing.

9424039,0,t3_59q6mz,Automatico M Trench.  This is the go to weapon if you wanna be at the top of the leaderboard with kills.  Its literally the scout elite class but without the extra armor and a little bit less range. You DO NOT AIM with this gun you hip fire. Close range it beats shotgun most of the time unless the guy is REALLY close talking lt  meters and that he knows how to aim and has fast reflexes. It destroys people even elite classes ive won v against elite classes a couple time already. I personally think its kinda OP for close quarter maps or closed up area.  TIP TIP wanna wreck even more? Put gas grenade on throw both where all the enemies are stacking. Put gas mask on remember you dont need to aim so gas mask has literally no downside with this gun. Go in and WRECK SHIT Be careful though the clip isnt too large so be careful!! Dont go for more than  kills with a clip.,battlefield_one,d9ak8l2,6,t5_3eer4

9448618,0,t3_5a4qnh,This is the downside of a server based system as opposed to matchmaking. I actually think they should offer matchmaking for the smaller infantry modes cause they often get very unbalanced and it can seem like only a few other dudes in your squad can shoot straight. However EA makes money from Rented Servers and many players seem to think it improves the game when it really doesnt so its unlikely to change. If it was matchmaking instead of a static server there would be extra time for matchmaking between matches. However Im sure there is theoretically a better way to balance games for all the modes. If one squad is really good it should stack the deck against them with fewer player on that side even. ,battlefield_one,d9dofpr,4,t5_3eer4

Play as... the Support class!Now I just want to say one more thing.gt Youre assuming that theres a Support on every corner waiting for your glare. There isnt.There isnt now because you cant suppress a target from  meters. Give support the ability to suppress at range and any time you saw that glare you would go prone and start laying down fire while telling your team Hey guys theres a sniper about  meters away. Go ahead and rush them since Im laying down suppressing fire in bursts.If you cant see an issue with support being able to do their secondary job at any range youre clearly just being biased.

And when youre out of ammo youre still a SMGshotgun welding killer that can go play the damn game. Youve done your part and made it very risky for the tank go stay on the objective. If Goodwilling a second player in my team of  tries to damage the man tank he might actually kill it.  Part of my frustration with BF  was that hitting a tank once made you a prime target and tanks could zoom right up and take you out. BF tanks dont have the speed to do that so its easier to unload your rounds and get away.    With the crews and the angles of the guns its actually harder to go up and TNT a tank but I dont feel forced to now that I can do solid damage from a distance and have a chance of escaping.  ,battlefield_one,d9gat4x,1,t5_3eer4

I thought this was an issue when you put the Xbox in the standby mode and then I would have to unplug it from the wall for a few seconds. But now it is happening every match which makes it frustrating because it doesnt even seem like the stats Im getting in the matches are sticking.

Ive had a couple matches that turned out really well including one on the winning team where we captured all points except the two in the fortress. Its so well defended though that our team was getting mowed down as we ran across the sand up towards the fortress. It was seriously a cool feeling charging with  guys towards the walls and trying to get out of the Line of Sight from the defenders on the walls above.

Dynamite kills interrupt a sniper rooftop party by blowing up the house.  vehicle destroys with KBullets see friendly AA shooting at a plane and pop a few into it see cavalry charging put down the horse.

Mostly audio and visual distortion with some trouble aiming for longer range units.  So BF equivelant would be minor aiming problems for medics and major for scouts.  Which imo would add a lot to the scout especially and make it far more difficult rewarding and skill based.

Then every  kills after that gives you another.  And finally unlocking the last skin with like k kills or so.  That way when you have a certain skin on a gun you can proudly say that you earned it.

We visited like  years ago and paid tribute to him. But thats not all.

And what is this earn it thing youre talking about? How is sitting at your spawn point instead of sitting in the menu earning anything? Also sitting at a spawn rather than in menu just gives the enemy an opportunity to kill you and giving them more points so a good player would still choose to sit in menu rather than waiting around for a sniper to use as target practice. ,battlefield_one,d9mgl3g,1,t5_3eer4

9520448,0,t1_d9mjuks,gt But the is BF get good at recoil compensation the game even lets you set your recoil pattern and you can kill ppl way over m.There is no recoil. It has bullet spread something you do not have control over. Find a flat wall walk out about  meters aim and tap the trigger prone or standing it doesnt matter. The shots will not all land in the same spot not even remotely. This isnt unique to LMGs Medic rifles do it to but at a greater distance.  This part of the reason Scout is so popular because if a scout aims his gun at someones head  times out of  it will hit them. While you may have figured out how to git gud with support it doesnt detract from the fact the supports are objectively the worst class in the game. ,battlefield_one,d9mlivp,2,t5_3eer4

9538965,0,t1_d9oqp8u,The most obvious example of the difference is with field guns.Usually with a field gun if you rotate it using ADleft analog stickI assume on consoles as in you are moving the field gun itself it will also move the turret the actual barrel where you are aiming the field gun with it. If you turn the setting on and rotate the field gun where you are aiming will not move with it.Another example is in tanks usually if you turn the tank it will also affect where you are aiming with the setting off this doesnt happen. In planes its quite annoying when the pilot is flying erratically and making your aim go all over the place. With the setting on it means that your aim is not affected by the pilot until you get to a point where your turret cannot point where you want it to such as some of the gunner seats which only allow you to shoot backwards.The setting is described by its name it decouples aiming from vehicle rotation. It removes the link between aiming the weapons of a vehicle from the rotation of the vehicle.,battlefield_one,d9ovjo9,2,t5_3eer4

Im fine with mortars being super powerful its the firing speed that I have an issue with its way too easy to just lay down all your rounds in a very quick pace without giving the opponents a chance at counter play.There are issues with balance in Operations but I think that might be a combination of mortars and just lack of general understanding of how to play.

The experience you get on official servers with poor sportsmanship and lack of PTFO  on them really ruins what to me has been my favorite franchise since we had LAN parties to play  when I was a teenager.   I know this is being worked on so Im just waiting until thats rolled out to really get back on the bucket Im going to agree with some LMG buffsNot being able to spawn in on a squad mate who is under fire drives me nuts. I know people complain about spawning and dieing right away but when Im talking to my squad mate am aware of exactly what is going on and they need help I would like an option to still spawn in on them maybe after a warning. Id like to see medics get a little more reward for revivinghealing team matesAA should be strong but not godlike. Id like to see changes made that make it reward less spamming and more skill. The fighter really needs it TTK looked at because as people have stated the bombers gunner can take you out before you even get a chance to take them out. Better point dispersion for people who help with behemoth kills currently it seems that the only person who is really highly rewarded is the person who lands the killing blow I understand that changing this may require some serious work done on the scoring system to accommodate people getting points for the damage they do to hard to kill targets but it is pretty frustrating to spend a good amount of timerisk to whittle down a behemoth and miss the reward because someone got a lucky shot. I really miss the weapon modification from Battlefield . I know that in WWI weapons systems where a hell of a lot less modular but they had stuff like muzzle breaks silencers and what have you. It really made the weapons feel like a deep and rewarding aspect of the game. As an aside I wanted to thank you and everyone at DICE for the many years of enjoyment you folks have brought to myself and my family through Battlefield. Thank you so much for taking the time as you always do to ask these questions of us non famous youtubers. ,battlefield_one,d9zn9vu,2,t5_3eer4

The way theyre positioned in a straight line is what allows the first team to capture the majority of points to dominate the entire match not necessarily the number of objectives themselves. Honestly I think just  couldve worked out if they just adjusted the map layout to be more balanced. The way things currently are Suez will always be a tugowar stacked heavily in favor of the first team to gain a slight advantage.Edit it also doesnt help that the new ticket system makes comebacks a nearly impossible task,battlefield_one,da2zyq8,1,t5_3eer4

9659102,0,t1_da2zveh,gt BF Originalists. Started BF on  or BF just wants that classic BF feel and HC is as close as they can get. They were one of the  people that played classic mode in BF. Generally decent people but get progressively more elitist and intolerable the more nostalgic they get. Do not mention the Bad Company series to them.I am in the first and this group...   Although I only got BF a few months ago I was still in BF sue me and would have been if WW was not my favorite time period.What about HC do you think appeals to BF players?   I have never noticed a higher percentage of us playing in HC...  I think most of the series has made great improvements... the only negative side was some of the changes to team work... such as aircraft carriers being player usable and the way artillery worked Scout had to spot an area to give arti a view of it then they could drop shells where ever in that area.   Other updates like the  of people near a flag affects capture rate BF Vietnam and squad communications BF destructible environments BFBC and so forth have mainly been good for the series.Also I am off to look up classic mode...Also I enjoyed BFBC...  IMO it is the best single player story line of any BF game yet... including BF.  BFBC felt to me like BF did after BF basically the same exact game with updates that should have been patches to the older game... but you gotta make money for a studio somehow.,battlefield_one,da3oq0c,1,t5_3eer4

9663511,0,t3_5dfhi0,I think Ive got the idea.So when you attack and win a sector in operations you get a certain attack rating  weak attack  great attack or something to that effect. This works for defence as well you also get a rating for it based on how long you managed to hold off the opposition.Now the attackdefence rating system at the end screen is the accumulation of those attackdefence rating points you got in the different sectors in the game. Its just a total.Unfortunately DICE managed to fuck this up and the system is broken to shit. If there is an operations map with  sectors in total and youre on the attacking team the maximum amount of points you can get is  x whist the minimum I believe is  but it could be . So bearing in mind the maximum is  and minimum is  DICE messed it up so you can get lt attack defence points. Or gt attackdefence points.Hope this cleared some things up.,battlefield_one,da48adx,62,t5_3eer4

Me and  of my friends all had numerous issues playing after the patch like game loading taking way longer than before or loading into a game and then being removed from it.

If they give you the Flametrooper a competent squad could clear it out but other than that its impossible.Not sure how they didnt see that was going to be an issue.

So I did.I had the exact same experience yesterday then I noticed everyone in the squad all had the same emblem so I figured they were probably in a party chat and I just gave it to him.  gtHe promptly booted me from the squad and locked it.He didnt boot me ... but it did take him over  minutes to realize he had been made squad leader and start issuing orders.

IS there a particularly accurate assault rifle in the game?And we are indeed playign the objective... We try constantly to get to and capture the point and to deny the enemy doing the same. Either our teams suck or we suck enough to drag the team down though cause weve consistently lost everything in  full Operations so far. I generally play Medic... Its the only class I do decently with by ressing everything I can see... My friend switches around a bit.

Hold down the trigger pinpoint accuracy up to some respectable distances. Never overheats like an LMG so just keep on firing.

There is always the reward of getting better experiencing Only in Battlefield moments and just having fun. I get that we all get that.But at some level I feel a progression system is nice to have its the same for me as knowing I got  kills with some weapons does it enhance the gameplay it does not. But its that little progression that feels nice.Being an old school Quake player I know very well there is simple reward in just having fun and playing the game but then new games and new progression systems popped up and now I am kinda used to games having them and I am enjoying them. I guess its a case of being a little spoiled of the last  years of gaming where such systems been getting richer and more indepth for each iteration. So I agree it does bother me a little that BF system is so shallow as it is. Ill still play the game and still have fun for a long time its just a thing I miss.

I often see them sitting somewhere not realising they are next to enemy or leaving a flag before it is cleared.  They also play the game in panic mode constantly running around without thinking.  Make your minimap bigger  and zoom it out think about what you are doing look for signs of enemy think about the flow of the game and where the enemy is coming from.  Position yourself behind cover when you know they are coming. Scope up if you expect enemy to be coming get a pair of surround sound headphones etc.  Your lack of twitch reflexes wont matter a lot of the time.,battlefield_one,dak9j8c,16,t5_3eer4

Most AA gunners will have trouble hitting you if you keep this up and once they give up and turn their fire elsewhere you swoop in and blast them. Of course I fly fighters and attack planes may lack the speed for this tactic.Good luck out there.,battlefield_one,dao07up,1,t5_3eer4

9860792,0,t1_dastuph,utwosteps ... youre correct and I did think about adding screen shots.  But I thought I would let someone else do that.  Since this is a community I thought they may enjoy chipping in.As for Wireshark there isnt a load on the computer...at least nothing noticeable enough to be wary of it.  You wouldnt see an FPS drop as it runs on clientside... after the packets have arrived.  You could put it in front of your MACIP.  That might slow your FPS but you could also mirror a port.  And it allows you to go review a game where you thought there was indications of cheating.One example is a lag switch...for a any specific gamer.  Couple that with a FRAP and you could prove beyond a shadow of a doubt if someone were using it.It would also work with aimbots and autotrigger controllers of micesoftware.  These tend to be the bigthree.  Im not sure how it could work against wallhacks...but the FRAp would show that in killcam.Anyway Wireshark is a really good aftereffect analysis tool...that cant be fooled.  In short you cant send a fake packet from Cheater clientside to server and on to nonCheater clientside without it being recorded.Send those to EAOrigin...and they may be able to find signature packets of cheaters.  And while there could be glitches ...they would not be routine such as a Hacker might demonstrate.Longer story  I used to play Arma Arma II.  When I began Hackers were running rampant on our servers and our Clan was very frustrated.  We had a good following but they were just as frustrated as our Clan members.  The Clan was kind of small so we looked for a cheap and secure read as fool proof way to prove someone was hacking as they would permanently be banned by their game and Player IDs.As a Network Auditor Wireshark is my go to for packetprotocol examinations.  Too easy to find errant and erroneous packets with it  pattern analysis... that can be run by the computer itself.  And since Wireshark can be automated with alerts it needs very little oversight until it sends you an alert.  Then a few minutes of packets scans of realtime observation of the accused Players and you would know if they were running cheatshacks.Example  On Arma If you were running a map that did not have an item in it i.e. buses snowmen etc. or should have only  x lb bombs with a landing rearming in between a reload of  x bombs it was easy to follow the packets to see who was ordering this stuff up on the fly hackingcheating.  We got so good at it I finally figured out the packets being sent when they started the cheatshacks and scripted a ban that kicked them before they could do harm.  Even automated the reporting to Steam for banning.Since Arma is just as intensive as BF I dont a see a problem with using it here.But I am open to suggestions and convos.,battlefield_one,dasvucx,2,t5_3eer4

The race for the final pigeon release was absolutely exhausting and exciting as each team scraped tooth and nail against all odds to make it. With one minute left in the grueling  minute match our team pulled it off and secured the victory.I had never seen the chatlog so awash with so many GG! holy shit goddamn what a fucking match!.

9953618,0,t3_5i1ew3,I was so bad it hurt me personally so I had a vendetta to not suck for my own conscious. Once you learn wtf is going on where the bad guys come from when to duck from a sniper when there probably arent any bad guys where youre about to run etc you can get very good and there are so many ways to enjoy this game. I was  kills and  deaths my first couple days I almost quit in general. So glad I didnt.A big part was learning that if you look on the map Objective A B C are blue and D is changing from blue to red there is probably a big ass war going on at D so the closer you get the more likely a sniper will be looking for you on the other team and standing still for a second in the open means youll get shot. Also Expect to die A lot.  I thought it would be like halo where you can be indestructible for a whole game but if youre dying and shooting youre playing the game and helping the team even if you are a distraction for a second. Its based on points not on kills or deaths. For the longest time I couldnt tell what was me running in the way being oblivious vs. just bad luck when typically there werent bad guys in that area so that was important to learn to.If it was a simple game to figure out it wouldnt be fun its only fun because the chaos and the variables makes  different ways to win and enjoy it.

9955677,0,t3_5hzwri,Yup if you have  objectives then focus on defense you have no need to take the other points.Also in operations when defending sometimes its better to just give up one objective to focus on another more easily defended objective.  For example Monte Grappa let them take the outdoor objective and have your whole team focus on defending one of the objectives in the bunker.  Its much easier position to defend and it will give you some intense action and great firefights and let you rack up points.,battlefield_one,db58zzy,1,t5_3eer4

A few times I tried to go around on Ballroom and got taken out by someone waiting for the flank. Eventually the team figured it out on Ballroom and we won. At Argonne there was one glorious time when we broke through and got A and B but it just went back to the meatgrinder soon enough.

9972388,0,t1_db7dxgz,Maybe you just got used to the big dead zone that was present since bf released and your having trouble getting used to a smaller dead zone. Or it could be that your controller was already suffering from stick drift but you wouldnt be able to notice it in bf before the patch because the game has had a dead zone thats way too big since the games release. this would also explain why youre having to increase the values for the stick dead zone setting instead of lowering the values Hope this helps.Edit but also try going through the steps in my post and start the dead zone at  and keep increasing it until theres no stick drift present. Once youve done that then try lowering your sensitivity because maybe you only had a high sensitivity in the first place to compensate for the overly large dead zone that was present since the games release but that large dead zone wouldnt be present now after the dead zone has been set properly.Hope this helps ,battlefield_one,db7fgkf,3,t5_3eer4

If I knew my team had too many scouts and not enough medics I would obviously spawn as a medic and vice versa. Sometimes I would like to play scout knowing my team is diverse enough and they can progress without missing a medic. Edit yes the scoreboard shows what class someone plays. But you have to individually look at each player and count.  Im talking about a simple number on the class icon maybe right on one of the upper corners not to waste time on individually counting what each player is playing as.Edit thanks for the massive support of the idea.

10038816,0,t1_dbfb99p,TBH all the free dlc in the world couldnt keep playing those games as long as I have BF. As for overwatch and RS they are both newer games marketed around this idea of free core content with only cosmetic micro transactions. BF has the luxury of being a well established franchise. Heck its grown even larger with BF. They have nothing to prove because they know people want what they are selling. And dont forget that people get addicted to micro transactions. One person might pay USD for  dlc packs but people in overwatch and RS could literally spend thousands on purely cosmetic aspects in the hopes of RNG packs granting them enough in game currency or the specific cosmetic item of their dreams. The free dlc was a marketing tactic.  companies are going to make their money one way or another.

Nothing I hate worse than getting killed after wounding an enemy down to hp and then getting an almost instant revive by a medic you sprinted over to me and then we both get mowed down by the almost dead guy. Take a second to look for an enemy before blinding reviving a teammate. This will save both of you time and frustration...

10133033,0,t1_dbsbief,Just because its not easy to use very well doesnt mean its bad. An objectively bad weapon in Battlefield has no niche and is outclassed by other weapons in its class at every range while Huot definitely has a very strong range niche. It was very difficult to use the FAMAS and play optimally for objective play but it certainly wasnt a bad weapon. It had a very short range niche that certainly wasnt ideal for fighting near objectives a small magazine and a long reload but it sure as hell wasnt a bad weapon because it in the right hands it was the best weapon in the class for winning vs. The  and the Huot are the same way but unlike the FAMAS which was dominant by virtue of extreme fire rate the Huot is dominant by virtue of extreme accuracy. Your argument about other weapons being more easily usable than the Huot could certainly translate to the the FAMAS the AEK shoots a bit slower but is allaround more usable and to the average player its a better weapon. Does this make the FAMAS bad? The MG and Lewis Gun are certainly easier to use by virtue of ammo capacity and to the average player the accuracy advantage of the Huot wouldnt always be worthwhile. Does this make the Huot bad? Certainly not. If a weapon is superior to all the other weapons in its class at a certain role its not an objectively bad weapon. It doesnt have to be the most versatile role but thats just the nature of BF balancing. I think the term youre looking for is not bad but rather not versatile. Even then the MG isnt very versatile since the BenetMercie Storm is the best gun for hunting for headshots and the Madsen MG Storm has the best compromise between a good TTK at common engagement ranges and usability. ,battlefield_one,dbsc8er,1,t5_3eer4

10147463,0,t3_5l9yld,I honestly dont care about Close Quarters focused maps they are too onesided. I like maps that have plenty of relatively safe space for infantry  since youve mentioned BF the best DLC in any Battlefield that Ive played is Aftermath  it has  mostly infrantry only maps and  regular maps and all of them are awesome. Extremely well balanced and pleasure to play either as infantry or with vehicles. A true pleasure to play however I wanted to. And with few very slim exceptions in BF Propaganda Outbreak and perhaps Zavod we never got similarly balanced maps again. Oh and some of the Karkand maps were amazing as well despite them apparently not being as well designed as originals.I just wish DICE would start prioritizing gameplay over presentation in these maps. People endlessly discuss weapons but I almost never see them talking about maps as if they dont think maps matter. They matter just as much as any other elements of the game. Aftermath showed me that its possible to strike a great balance in such hectic game and ever since Ive been lamenting about too many maps build for impressing visually but being primitive dull and shallow just like an intern learning the ropes would create. But really pretty.BF was a bit too experimental with the DLC CQ and Armored Kill were both interesting additions but I never cared that much about them. BF did same thing with Naval Strike those DLCs will cater to certain audience but for a lot of people it will be either hit or miss.,battlefield_one,dbu7ttd,20,t5_3eer4

10199683,0,t1_dc05cmx,I realize that youre not supposed to face every enemy like that however Im an aggressive player who tries to use flanks to get teammates behind enemy lines. The BAR is my gun of choice because of rate of fire and the easy ability to control at close range. What sucks is it only has  rounds a clip. The MG is close in rate of fire but not in damageaccuracy. The Lewis is better than that because it deals more damage than the MG but its slower rate of fire makes it difficult to win some gun battles. If only the MG was just even a smidge more accurate or higher in damage it could be the best option for flanking. I dont use bipods because Im never standing still long enough to use them. I constantly move kill after kill after kill.And even then in the example youre using the MG would need to cool off before you can successfully empty a clip... therefore making the flank in this example extremely difficult to pull off. ,battlefield_one,dc06vwo,1,t5_3eer4

10221033,0,t3_5mcvh7,I was think about this with the lack of distinction between LMG variants.  I agree the players are using the suppressive variants as hip fire bullet ho with the scope it should be more reliant on the bipod.   I think a better way to go is increasing the stance spread of the bipod DICE did this last time but not enough. I would put a small increase spread with bipodnot using  extended mag increase in recoil this makes Low Weight Telesopic and Suppressive more dependent on ADS and Bipod.  Stance spread cant not be reduced by firing only by change stance. Using bipod attachment gives those massive advantage but still allows them to use ADS without bipod at short range.      Optical Storm and Trench I think are fine but some people are not going to like talk of changing their favorite toy to be a bit more specialized.,battlefield_one,dc2m0nw,3,t5_3eer4

10239746,0,t1_dc4chf3,On Monte Grappa the flags at the turrets are the ones Im just so annoyed about speaking as an attacker. The defenders can stay defending those flags by staying in the bunkers which only have  entrances. These entrances alone are an annoance for the attacking team since theyre too small for  players to enter at the same time and once youve managed to enter the bunkers therell be  defenders who are more than ready to kill you and youve no chance of staying alive in there for  seconds. I propose a giant hole on top of the bunker after the turrets are destroyed for an extra entrance for the attacking team.,battlefield_one,dc4qdln,1,t5_3eer4

10268155,0,t1_dc6z4qe,gt How do I avoid getting dropped on so much?This is something I still struggle with. It gets better with experience just because of familiarity with the maps  you start just know where the likely locations are to look out for. Beyond that for me it comes down to a few things like staying calm so Im not getting too amped up and just sprinting everywhere. And also just not sprinting everywhere. Thats really the key point. I try to be deliberate and methodical. I move to cover wait and scope the area then move to the next cover carefully with awareness. When Im sprinting Im often getting tunnelvision and not paying attention to my surroundings and thats when I get clipped. I want the enemy moving into my field of view without knowing Im there rather than me blundering into theirs. So I move slowly wait watch move again. I sprint when I know the area ahead is clear otherwise Im checking my corners and covering approaches so I see them before they see me ideally. ,battlefield_one,dc7y9m8,2,t5_3eer4
10269939,0,t1_dc4bvoe,Lol rush in bf does not suck. It is just more skill demanding. If FLIR mortar etc is the reason you think rush in bf suck it only implies you are not skillful enough.

It does not need long hours of grinding to achieve high skills recoil controlling or awareness. Ops players can easily boost their spm up to .k and  skills points and they are only average.    In BF you dont get scouts flare shows you everything on the minimap no gas and gas masks that put assault class at a leading advantage. Recoil controlling give you great advantage in BF but I personally do not find this skillset in BF. Ops is great but in BF it is just spray and rush. ,battlefield_one,dc85jpl,1,t5_3eer4

10279967,0,t1_dc99d16,Ill try to reply to these in order MP  The MP has better accuracy recoil and a little better mag size than the Automatico. It also already has a little better damage dropoff dropping to only an  hit kill at min damage vs. the Automaticos . The A has a one hit kill advantage over the M by around m. In return the M has a huge fire rate advantage  rpm vs.  rpm over  faster. The g Auto while it doesnt one hit kill fires even faster. It can get off the  hits needed to kill  enemies faster than the A can get off two shots. The SL offers the fire rate of some of the fastest rifles like the Cei Rigotti and M but with the high damage . bullet. A larger mag size is inaccurate to the real rifle and would make it outclass several other rifles. If you want more capacity with the same damage the Mondragon is there. If you want more capcity with the same fire rate use the Cei. The SL is there for those that want the damage and the fire rate and dont mind giving up mag size to get it. The M Experimental is a unique close range option for scout and its intentionally a bit weaker than assault SMGs. That said swapping between the Pedersen Device and normal . is something we worked on before launch but had issues getting the  way swap between . . and K bullets working. Its definitely something Id like to revisit but I cant promise anything there. The Auto  .s offer highest in class fire rate with good damage. Theyre some of the fastest killing weapons in the game at mid range. For a medic that sticks to cover theyre a great option massive burst damage with minimum exposure time.,battlefield_one,dc9agx6,19,t5_3eer4

10298175,0,t3_5n7ivi,What are your thoughts on Support weapons overall?I love Support its my most played class but....youch.BAR seems fine the high ROF makes up for the damage. I can see what you wanted from this gun. Madsen seems fine its close enough. Closest thing to an Assault Rifle the game has anyway after the BAR. Again I see the intent. MG seems fine its slower ROFwise but youll be bipoding with it anyway and its fine. Once again I see what this gun is for. Everything else I had extreme trouble getting basic kills with and Id really like to hear a developers thoughts on what they want from those guns. Mainly the Lewis Benet and partially the Huot  I still like the Huot even though it needs just a little more love I feel. Its in a better place then the LewisBenet at least. .To give an example of what I mean Ive had multiple cases with the LewisBenet especially while leveling them to Service Star where Id just be fucked in a perfect situation for me. Get the drop on a MedicAssault from behind have time to prone AND start firing and before I could get all  shots off they were able to turn and kill me. Its just extremely difficult to justify using those guns when those scenarios can happen so frequently. Even when you catch them unaware its better to use your sidearm or melee to kill them over your primary. Worse they feel overshadowed by the other Support weapons. The Lewis seems to be a bipod focused LMG but if Im using a bipod Im using the MG. Its a straight upgrade in every way. The Benet seems to be a closemidrange attack gun but its outshadowed by the BAR and Madsen respectively. Outside of that what are your thoughts on the current leveling scheme in the game when it comes to weapon partioning? I found it incredible hard to be motivated while leveling Support because the weapons didnt feel very uniquedifferent. They all had the same damage largely the same stats similar clip sizes and the ROF was the main separator. The Huot is widely considered a mediocre r so I didnt feel very encouraged to get that either  though I ended up loving it. . I mainly stuck with the BAR and worked off that. That seems poorly designed considering the gameplay loop should have me encouraged at all times to move forward with new weapons.Another class I felt suffered from this was the Assault. I love tank busting and am good at it. I never felt satisfied with any of the Assault weapons I didnt enjoy being forced into close range only so I felt unhappy with basically every weapon I tried. It wasnt until I gained the Hellriegal did I really enjoy the class because suddenly I had a weapon that was decentgood at midlonger ranges which gave me the versatility I desired. Considering the Hellriegal is unique in that it fulfills a role no other Assault gun currently does it felt almost as though I was forced to spend  hours playing Assault poorly to really play the class I wanted to play. Is there any possibilityidea of changing something like the MP Optical to have a bit less recoil so it could function in a more midrange role?And last Scout variety. One of the things I loved about previous Battlefield games was the shotgun wookie ie the close range Scout. People pulling from the generic poolfast firing weapons like the Vector on their Scouts so they could use the aoe spot to help their team upfront and ESP through most fights to make up for the lower damage guns. It was an incredibly fun class to play yet doesnt exist in Battlefield . The Russian Trench is too unreliable the Carbines dont have good enough hipfiretoo slow ADS and the Experimental is awful  I dont want carpal tunnel. . Why was this class option removed? It feels like the variety of options for this class was limited. Thanks! ,battlefield_one,dcbcqzo,1,t5_3eer4

The default value is .For me when its on the default value my GPU only sees about  to  usage while the CPU usage is about  all  cores. When I change it to  my GPU usage increases to  while the CPU usage is just the same. But it also provides about  to  fps increase.

10302398,0,t1_dcbq090,Ascend if youve ever heard of NOVA. They are wellknown dedicated aggressive recons. Undeniably they have decent sniping skills. However youve got to understand how the skill points in BF is calculated. A player who plays rushoperation will have a significantly higher skill point and spm if he constantly on the objective. But that does not make him a skilled player. Arming capping in ops objectives boosts skill points a lot more than capping objectives in conquestdomtdm.    If by skilled you mean aiming accuracy reflex movement or recoil controlling then skill pointsspm are not the stats to be compared. Skilled is not equivalent to PTFO and vice versa.,battlefield_one,dcbtyyx,1,t5_3eer4

10305178,0,t3_5nj0gs,I think there are a two things to considerFirstly spawning a plane to get across the map should be stopped I would personally like a lock where if the health is  and you have been in it for less than  minutes not sure what time limit is actually reasonable then you should not be able to leave the plane as a pilot.Secondly if you are going down or spent  minutes not getting kills and getting bored then as a pilot you should be able to stop people from spanning in for a short period call it the bailing period I for one have been in that situation but afraid to bail encase someone spawns in just then and dies then I feel like a dick.What ever the solution is and my suggestion are probably not on point it does need to be something that helps reduce the taxi problem but without penalising good pilots with bad luck for example the team kill idea you propose would mean if you have  heath on your plane you jump and two passengers dont should you get penalised with team kills? Personally I dont think so even if what ever happens fixes an issue it needs to not cause another DICE need to be careful with their approach I hope it is addressed though and addressed correctly.A lock after spawning to prevent Taxis and the ability to seeing a vehicles heath on before spawning could be all that is need tbh.,battlefield_one,dcc5b9a,2,t5_3eer4

While weather is clear the keep has overwatch of D and B and D coming down to C.

10387944,0,t1_dclg2aw,gt Theres a difference between having a range where one weapon is superior and having a range where one weapon works great while all other weapon types are completely ineffectualAnd BF is the latter! Most weapons have extremely low base spreads so theyre all usable at most ranges theres just a clear separation between whats supposed to be dominant at which range. Spread is not binary and while its random to an extent its predictable. For example the Huot can maintain a  hitrate out to  meters on full auto. When you fire the SLRs at around  of max RoF they have  accuracy. BFBC had spread too actually a pretty decent amount of it too the movement system was just very different so engagements felt different. Youre just looking at it through rosetinted glasses.In BF map design is just fine. The only areas where youre really that exposed to sniper fire are  meter sight lines where sniper rifles should be good. There are plenty of flank routes on every map but Suez which basically plays like Metro. Get good use smoke use transport vehicles and use suppression to protect yourself from sniper rifles. Or just counter snipe. ,battlefield_one,dclje2r,1,t5_3eer4

The fighter though it lacks weapons to properly take on armor has the most utility of all the aircraft. It controls the sky against everything else even damaging dirigible behemoths can escape flak guns the most quickly and the ground support variant absolutely destroys infantry. Yes even more so than the attack plane which drops bombs in a straight line missing most of clustered infantry and even giving them time to escape before going off. The ground support attack plane peppers the ground for  meters with a  meter width exploding on impact for the immediate kill of clustered infantry with no escape. ,battlefield_one,dcxs2ay,3,t5_3eer4

Choose userfriendly guns I liked the cei rigotti and lewis gun starting out. All shotguns are more or less great from  foot away.  Learn the maps campaign helps When in doubt blow shit up before charging in.  Dont run out in the open when you can avoid it.  When in a tank dont rush it in without your team. Killing tanks is my favorite aspect of the game and the hardest part is getting to a tank that is surrounded by its teammates.  Use the right gun for the right mapgame mode. If youre playing war pigeons assault all day. If youre playing operations medic and support suddenly become XPmachines as you resupplyheal your team and use the longer range guns to fuck shit up on bigger maps. Scout I guess if youre into that sort of thing. I find it unrewarding sitting there and hoping people run in front of you so you can get a  hp hit and hope your teammates kill them so you get the assistcount as kill. Most importantly dont let being new ruin the fun. ,battlefield_one,dcxy07l,7,t5_3eer4

10508397,0,t3_5qg6oe,Add in an armored truck that is just the artillery truck without the primary weapon and that uses a fixed HMG like the Mortar Variant has instead of an LMG.  Add benches in the rear.  Driver drives the vehicle passenger  mans the fixed HMG passengers  ride in the back.  Roof is open so passengers are vulnerable from that direction.  Add the Armored Cars to more maps and increase their spawn frequency by adding them to certain points.  On maps like Amiens the Armored Car actually can serve a purpose.  Do what Call of Duty  did with its vehicles in Multiplayer mode where the sidecar acts as a surface where anybody with a bipod can deploy it.  Same thing with the passenger seat on the scout car.  This should encourage more players to actually squad up in their passenger vehicles think about a motorcycle operated by a support driver and an assault passenger that drives around firing the AT rocket gun at tanks.  ,battlefield_one,dcz8kwi,35,t5_3eer4

10509310,0,t1_dczb9ed,It was my lazy nature. I couldnt be asked to be put it on Imgur. I dont care about followers lolgt Dont pay for additional content then why should you play additional content? Not the main problem heregt The launch game has had a pretty great amount of content on release along with a free mapSubjective but I disagree. Comparing to previous titles and their vanilla content its seriously lacking.gt Just activating those guns on vanilla maps would be asking for trouble.Obviously. Common sense.And copy pasta to explain the problemLet me be more clearThe problem I personally have with this is how its presented. DICE has nothing to do with this other than they are the developers. The problem I have is with EAs Marketing team.Sure it might take a lot of work to make a stationary object to be interactive but at the end of the day us gamers see the end result. If we see the same object in vanilla content and then we see it in DLC being actually used thats fine because game design. But then EA is promoting that thing as a brand new PremiumDLC feature thats where my problem is.Instead of focusing on this why cant DLC be presented differently? Focus on the maps gives us the layouts of the maps more screenshots prealpha screenshots of the guns more details about the guns elite classes or tanks something that is actually meaningful and interesting.We have some awesome stuff to share with you guys but we cant talk about it. More info soon. Until then look at this redesigned vanilla content and make it more important than it seems like it. Look at the awesome wallpaper we made for itNo just no.

Theyre highly vulnerable to machine guns and Kbullets.

The Trench gun is good for close quarters and quickly wiping squads the Model A offers more consistency and range and the G for a bit of a mix between the two.Shotguns are really only recommended if you have the aim map knowledge and general skill required so perhaps practice with the MP and the Automatico first if you are unable to land your shots.,battlefield_one,dd34j5j,3,t5_3eer4
10542782,0,t3_5qymwc,Getting downvoted for asking a question? Classic.OP The A Hunter is a good choice. Its a bit slower than other Assault weapons but you can one shot kill which gives you the edge if you shoot first. Automatico both Trench and Storm are good hipfire weapons and very easy to use. Theyre very forgiving if you cant aim very well or just want to run and gun. Id also suggest some Dynamite.

10544964,0,t3_5qx11u,A nice balance of both is good... Dont go charging off into battle alone trying to cap points its just not productive and you are likely to last  minutes. Stick with your team and encourage them to stick with you. Dont play solely for kills and points but play in attempt to keep as many of your team attacking as possible. Help clear an objective with your team and move in to capture accordingly. A map like Amiens is difficult due to the small spaces within side streets etc perfect for an assault class ambush. If you lurk around D  C making sure the objectives to your rear remain under your control defense is equally important as attacking you should be able to help any decent team dominate. Avoid E  B as a tanker on Amiens. My main advice is to only shoot when you can guarantee a kill. Nothing worse than watching someone unload  rounds demolishing a building to see another fully loaded enemy heavy appear round the corner.  ,battlefield_one,dd3e0u5,1,t5_3eer4

Having multiple languages in one faction is a different story and DICE would need to hire multiple people from the countries you listed to do every single line again and then add them to the game only for a faction which appears on ? maps and might not even appear in DLC.

10591642,0,t1_dd8bpao,The fire rate portion of his comment is key.  It shoots slow...ish....and you can over sample the trigger.  It has really strange timing.Its also not the best.  I play almost exclusively medic.  Id suggest the M SL sweeper over the selbstlader for just about every situation.  Its surprisingly accurate  round magazine and is the only automatic in the class.  It is also usually a  shot kill same as the selb I believe but shoots faster.  Faster reload way less recoil.If youre at distances where the selbstlader is a better option go with the Mondragon.  It only has a  round magazine but its more accurate and can shoot faster. For some reason it just feels better.  Maybe the timing is easier to get used to.EDIT Forgot the Cei has an automatic fire mode.  I hate that gun for some reason though.EDIT I found a great website that lets you compare all the gun stats and things like accuracy and TTK.

10592659,0,t1_dd8ja8t,Ya the triple points are the hardest. But the thing is they arent all triple. Theres something called balance going on to make the operations work. Without the triples they would all be attacker steamrolls as again single defender slip up equaling a loss makes it hard to defend it for a long period. Triple or less attackers only have to momentarily have control. The fact that you fail to understand that is astounding. This makes the mode quite practical for attacker to win. Also if you try to hold a single point on a triple flag youre going to get fucked. Again defenders only need a single slip up and they lose it. Holding one flag only is a good way to lose very quickly with a single push. Your are trying to spin such a bullshit imbalance into it that simply does exist. How you are such an idiot is beyond me but the fact is that operations is not a defender biased mode.  man is pretty balanced and if anything attacker biased on some operations and balanced on the others.  man is a little defender biased but the extent to which you exagerate is hilarious. If you arent winning in attacker its probably because you personally are hurting your chances by sniping in your uncap with an artillery truck trying to go  because you like your KDR. ,battlefield_one,dd8judu,2,t5_3eer4

If youre moving using cover and are aware of your surroundings you are not going to get one hit killed by scouts very often. Certainly not as often as youll be immediately killed by an A or BAR or Automatico or Hellreigel or Sweeper or whatever. If snipers are a problem kill them. Move them from their position if you cant.

He stands up to peak out of a window to see what was up and instantly gets nailed with a bullet almost killing him. I threw him a health pack and my character said here this will stop the bleeding. Playing the first  minutes of campaign really showed me the value of all of the lives lost in war but this shirt phrase made me realize how sad terrifying and scary war really is. Like here man I know you just got blasted but this will help stop the bleeding and to be honest you have to keep fighting. Its just crazy. Best game I have ever played.

Lol fuck everyone else its a team game you should all cut the shit stop camping with as bipod lmgs and snipers and come and help us out. The medics dont ow you anything theyre the class that helps out everyone the most yet the least people play them so what more do you want? Want the  medics out of the  on the  man team to change to scout like the other  fucking scouts?FYI top  medic top  revives top  heals top  kills top  played time as medic. I also believe that medics win games and as someone who always plays medic it seems to have impacted a  game win ratio so Id say that works.

There isnt anything like this gun is worse or better they are made for specific purposes. Personally if you are going to get aggressive youre probably better off not using the Mondragon and try the Autoloading  . dont get discouraged by its  rounds the gun will simply melt everything within the ranges you are most likely to engage in and even with the mondragon youre most likely reloading after every kill anyways.,battlefield_one,ddg02n0,6,t5_3eer4

You could lay down prone and do that all day for a grand total of  kills assuming you hit every single shot and it would take about  seconds to do so. But if that assault had a bolt action rifle he would be much much more effective at long range. The point of the quote is that an assault isnt meant to consistently be able to fight easily at range. If the AT rocket is meant to be a long range antipersonel weapon than you may as well claim that the Scout having Kbullets makes him a tank hunter.

The fact that they dont even have to spend time downloading another Origin client is just... well... laugh or cry. ea is big on pushing their games and so they push a lot of free games. Therein lies the caveat to the process... the cheater must download one of their free games in order to qualify for an account merge. Not large games any free game.

10743333,0,t1_ddo04c7,Whether it goes or up down is not important.The speed of it is really big factor here on how quick you gain those points. Another huge factor that both teams are getting points regardless as long as you have flags at your disposal doesnt matter if you control the majority or not you will get points.In previous Battlefields for you to win game of Conquest you literally had to control the majority of the flags examples  vs   vs   vs   vs  etc. Even if the enemy team has a pro player that goes  in a match as long as you control the majority of the flags you will win regardless because thats the main point of the gamemode  conquer. In BF controlling the majority of the flags mean nothing. No point flanking working together as a team to capture their home flag because its more logical to go in the middle of the meat grinder and get more kills than you enemy.Read this when you have the chance.

People either dont know how to or just refuse to use spot flares and it is infuriating.  of the time the only way a spot flare is on the field is if I do it myself. What the hell gadgets are people using that there arent spot flares on the field  ? They are far and away the single most useful thing you can provide as a scout.Not only that but you can actually get some kills with it. I only have  kills with my  hours of playing scout but it can contribute towards getting a oneshot with your rifle that otherwise wouldnt have OHK because of the bit of damage the flare has done. I regularly put it in a high traffic areas and people run over it all the time unfortunately occasionally so do I P .

10819503,0,t3_5upqbk,I understand your frustration but you have to also understand the frustration of being a dead soldier and watching the medic range get lower and then inexplicably grow in distance until its out of range. Doesnt happen a lot but Ive seen a lot of clips highlighting this part of the game. I understand sometimes it takes longer if there is enemy fire. I tend to wait maybe  seconds longer than usual but if none of the medics in area seem to be making progress I spawn back in. I guess a way to combat this for you would be to play in a squad of people you know and communicate with to avoid confusion etc. Im impressed by your dedication to the Medic class though. ,battlefield_one,ddvyemx,2,t5_3eer4
10819792,0,t3_5ubytq,There are other mechanics to how spotting works other than just the cooldown that influence it from my experience playing. This could be totally wrong but I am fairly confident about it.Whenever you hit the spot button it casts a hitbox like a ray from where you are standing. The distance you can spot at seems to be affected by either class or weapon playing as a scout with iron sights and x zoom you can definitely spot enemies further than if you are holding an automatico or shotgun. It seems very much based on the effective range of your weapon. From my experience it seems like there is also a difference in the shape of the spotting hitbox or cone based on whether you are aiming down the sights or not although it seems pretty subtle.One way you can kind of test this is if you ever fly in the front gun of the bomber. Especially on a map like Monte Grappa when flying over B or D with a bomber you can spot large clumps of enemies with one press of Q almost like the gunner seat has a large circular spotting hitbox instead of the very narrow laser like one you get on foot.Also like other people mentioned here pressing the button just every few seconds will probably be more effective because you are basically casting out your spotting net exactly where you are aiming when you press it. If you are spamming the spot button theres a chance your aim will be off or you are moving and its not spotting where you think it is.,battlefield_one,ddvzh9e,1,t5_3eer4

10850061,0,t3_5v3n0t,Some general behemoth advice. Make sure you spot when youre driving or using artillery.. Pay attention to your position. Move the train away from certain parts of maps where enemies can easily hide and spam explosives whilst being protected. For the dreadnought make sure your secondary gunner who has ordinance can fire upon objectives.. Always try to aim for spotted enemies. Killing vehicles is easy with the dreadnought  and also the airship if the enemy is unaware. The train does a lot of damage but only in a small area so you have to be accurate disabling the enemy and anticipating the enemies route if they retreat. This is probably the most useful thing you can do in a behemoth especially in operations when defending. . If you dont know where any enemies are aim for choke points.. Aiming for dead teammates can also be effective as this is indicative of the enemy being in that area.. If you see that the enemy is capping an objective nuke that shit. If you know where people like to hide whilst capping objectives that really helps. Map knowledge and battle awareness really helps.. Aim for stationary weapons as they do massive damage to behemoths. This is very important for longevity.. The AA guns on behemoths those that fire explosive rounds are better in some instances than the main gunner seats. The dreadnought ones arent great for getting lots of kills but are so important for killing boats and planes which also gives you a fair amount of kills and especially points. Dont listen to your teams bitching if you know that what youre doing is best for your team. Getting the train blown up so a gunner can kill a couple assault players is not going to help anybody and the rest of your team probably will appreciate that. ,battlefield_one,ddz3v2n,3,t5_3eer4

10899923,0,t1_de3udwh,gtCrate or pouch?In general you want pouches on offense or during mobile assaults and crates on defense or static positions. Pouches heal faster and can fly a surprising distance to an injured teammate but only heal one at a time crates heal slower and only work in a specific area but will heal many teammates at a time. Dropping a crate to heal one teammate who keeps running away from you is ineffective at best. Personally I use the pouch  of the time and only switch to crate if the situation merits it. On Aragorn Forest in Conquest the play is usually pretty mobile so I stick with pouches most of the time. If its an Operation and were defending the bunker on the last sector switching to the crate is usually a good bet since you often have  teammates all clustered up in a small space taking fairly constant damage. ,battlefield_one,de48zxv,5,t5_3eer4

Mind if I do so with others?gtstop speaking in universals and claiming to know what smoke was designed for.I know what smoke grenades are designed to do and what they are used for. This may be a game but is a loose synthesis of small unit tactics which involve the use of smoke for exactly what Ive just described.gtIn particular youve failed to mention that it counters spotting and flares which youve failed to mention.I think the benefits of smoke speak for themselves without going into yet more benefits. But sure good point for more smoke.gtYour personal use of smokes let alone your apparent ineptitude at making one smoke grenade useful isnt indicative of everyones use of them.Using more than one smoke is tactical not ineptitude. You mentioned when we discussed it before you use it to cover a casualty when you revive them. Others use them in choke points. This suits single smokes just fine I agree since neither dead people or choke points move. My complaint is that losing the ability to use two denies the most realistic usageTwo smokes cover a larger area of ground when advancing. They also allow you to cover two separate avenues of approach one you might use the other you might not. This is a form of deceptionobfuscation. Also as mentioned above they can be used to smoke a vehicle which moves.. if you use one it just moves out of the smoke field. Yeah we discussed this before and I enjoyed the discussion.

Ill typically pair a pistol that fills a weakness from my primary. Scout Carbine gets the Frommer to finish targets off. Other loadouts get the Mars. Medic gets the Auto Revolver because its the best revolver in the game and helps out up close. Assault gets the Gasser because its versatile and the fast firing niche is filled by pretty much any of their primaries.

10996243,0,t3_5x002x,To win Argonne forest as the Americans requires a fairly coordinated team and a bit of luck. Its my favorite operation so I play it a fair amount and I rarely see the American side win. A lot of it comes down to the layout of the map. The second sector and especially the third sector are usually where any momentum that the American side has comes to a grinding halt. This is a result in the lack of passages that the Americans have to choose from to try and capture the objectives. Most of them are narrow and the German side simply needs to stack the choke points and it often times turns into a fairly onesided battle. I love the operation but I think they need to change something about it to make it a little more balanced. ,battlefield_one,deee2ad,1,t5_3eer4

Good thing you abandoned your horse friendo  you might have survived otherwise.TBH Im kind of amused at how fragile people get about Cavalry. If you suck at it just stop spawning it. If you want to get better ask around and people will help you improve. Hating or misusing the class because you cant figure out how to ride the horse effectively is just tacitly admitting that youre not only shitty at playing it but that youre too insecure to even acknowledge your own deficiencies and address them. I cant fly planes for shit but I dont have any trouble recognizing that thats due to my lack of practice and knowledge rather than because all planes inherently suck. ,battlefield_one,def1cz1,3,t5_3eer4

The prologue was near perfect to me in terms of tone it had the desperate brutality of the war and yet still humanized it upon your death by giving your soldier a name and life span. Then the campaign shifted to a generic solo missions like other have said where one man fought and won the war alone.     Edit Just as a point I found the trailer for They Shall Not Pass more emotionally engaging than the rest of BFs campaign.

It also temporarily spots enemies the flare happens to fly over also.

11158078,0,t1_dewqvnu,i can see your point but i really think that would be bad for the game. it would turn the skies into a game of rockpapersiscor. il use the attack plane until i bother you enough to spawn in on the fighter you kill me and then every other airplane would be inadequate for as long you had the fighter. id spawn in on the fighter maybe kill you and then we would keep it going never even threatening the ground forces at all. The attack plane does absolutely have a place in the game as it is right now. the rear seat gunner can easily fight of attacking fighters and then it can continuously strafe ground troops and offer the fighter a run for their money if they show interest. I want the ability to use a plane that can engage in dogfighting and ground support alike either of them on their own just gets too boring. i think the trench fighter is at a fairly good place as it is maybe a bit of tweaking could be done to it but its really hard to judge based on the state of the meta. I dont see how its unfair towards the infantrymen that the trench fighter exist as it is neither the pilots for that matter. Everyone have the ability to choose the trench fighter. And since the trench fighter offers the most interesting gameplay i think its a good thing that it is where it is now. the funny thing is that people still choose the attack plane over the trench fighter even when a decent trench fighter like my self have been picking them off all game. I think its reasonable to have the other planes in the game as a option for when you have a decent fighter on your team that you can rely on. I must say that i find it a bit contradictory that your concerned about the infantry farming pilots and yet want to reduce the incentive to choose a plane that can effectively mitigate the infantry farmers. If the attack plane became a better choice or the meta the infantry farming would only be worse.,battlefield_one,dewr8fx,2,t5_3eer4

Two booster packs each . each with  maps. about  bucks for  maps. Same price less maps. I suspect  is the same way or pretty close. Probably more reliant on booster packs old school DLC BFBF BFH also if Im not mistaken have all had pretty much the exact same model.Now to answer your question. Yes. Its perfectly okay to pay  for a single game. Games are getting and have been getting more expensive to make. Hell in  when BF was released if you adjust for inflation it cost like .

Good players will adapt based on the situation bad ones wont and of course theyll do poorly.  The central argument here remains unrefuted so to speak by you  that people shouldnt take antiinfantry tanks just because someone might be using an antitank tank.  While I expected a dig at my stats LOL saw that coming once I brought them up bear in mind I play less than many others do sadly.  I guarantee you Ive singlehandedly won many many games by my use gasp! of antiinfantry style tanks and quite frequently in the face of strong antitank opposition I might add.  But regardless of bragging here this isnt an argument that I see you having refuted factually nor do I see it as one you ever can refute so well have to agree to disagree.

11209447,0,t1_df2fsfq,Kicking pilots is a terrible idea. With the Attack Plane and squad communication things go great. Things Ive done with squads as an Attack Plane pilot. . Spotting. Flared specific areas for them bases trenches buildings flags the  flares that drop light up large areas and give your squad a leg up. I can also spot troop movement armor movement horses and warn them if theyre about to be surrounded. . Air support  Ive had them spot Snipers on hills that were pinning them down and killed them. Ive taken out roof tops with enemies Ive hit windows where Snipers were. Ive flown in right ahead of the squad and laid down fire bombs to weaken the emplacement. . Mobile spawn point. Only squad mates can spawn in the second Attack Plane seat. Only squad mates can jump out behind enemy lines allowing the rest of the squad to spawn on them to take the enemy by surprise. Your squad could have a sneak attack element of surprise as well as plane flares down to ambush enemies . Air superiority  tired of a Trench Fighter blissfully flying back and forth over you darting you to death? Ask your squad mate in the Attack Plane for help. Sure its slower but I almost never lose to fighters. Catch them in a turn with the cannon their wingstail is gone and their mobility is shot. ,battlefield_one,df2ktlv,6,t5_3eer4

In short unprepared Germans will get destroyed. However Rapture is more balanced even a bit biased for the defense I have seen a couple defensive stops there especially in the first and third sector.For Devils Anvil I won it  time on attack.

11238259,0,t1_df5tnv8,I guess the best way for me to word it is I feel like I cant get anywhere quick enough before everyone else moves onto another objective. Oh geez Point A is getting captured better get over th wait no they all moved to Point C then to another by the time I arrive at the first one. That and it feels like so far the other team seems to come in with bombers and tanks while my team has one whole horse. Again I probably just need to play and get more used to things but so far it just feels very slow.,battlefield_one,df5u9r3,1,t5_3eer4
11239323,1,t3_60fanj,Agreed. Only accurate and calculated grenade throws should actually result in a kill. As it is I just lob hail Mary grenades at clusters of enemies because I know that theres a fair chance of an easy one hit kill or two. The lethal radius should be small with a much bigger non lethal radius around it. If I know that Im not likely to get a kill with my grenade from random throws then I wont throw it. Ill hang onto it for when I know I can use it. Ammo . wont change that for me personally. Im not sure that it will help with grenade spam on chokepoints but there you need to cut off grenade resupply completely so the the endless waves of grenades are no longer possible. Nerfing the radius would still be a good move there though.,battlefield_one,df5ylsp,3,t5_3eer4
11239390,0,t1_df5ytvx,I personally would not spend any money on the skin packs... they are nice to have but its certainly not worth real world money to me.

11239418,0,t1_df5wy4k,I wouldnt be opposed to some sort of autospawn as long as they tweaked the spawn system to reduce or eliminate terrible spawns.

11242547,0,t3_60h7mc,So there is a bit of a bug right now in terms of the dlc weapon unlocks. Any objective the weapons give to achieve x amount of kills in a round with for example the BenetMercio the . etc must be completed LAST. That is to say do second objective first for example revive  people or get  mortar kills and THEN do the x in one round objectives. ,battlefield_one,df6br2h,1,t5_3eer4

In addition it splits the playerbase and may give those who bought the DLC an unfair advantage weapons etc.Look at for example witcher .

Rocket gun nbs   I cant believe the range the MA Hunter will one tap you at. Ridiculous. Fuck the Battlepack system. Absolute bullshit when you try your ass off to cap points and carry the team only to get nothing while the dude going  gets a streak of them every game.   Not a fan of the new grenade system but it isnt the worst thing   I like them a lot but I genuinely think a few of the maps are one sided.   Edit Behemoth system sucks. I dont think Ive ever seen a Behemoth turn around a game. Usually when my team is losing its because we dont have enough bodies on the points. So the game gives us this giant thing that everyone piles into and the result is that we have even less bodies on the points since the Behemoth always ends up in the hands of the worlds worst pilot or engineer.,battlefield_one,dfbie6p,6,t5_3eer4

11337700,0,t3_61qext,Autorotation is the most cancerous thing that DICE has ever added to a console BF game starting with BF. It promotes spammy LRtwitch gameplay where scrubs just lockon to one another in CQC and get free kills. Gone are the days of just having a moderate aimslowdown when near an enemy. All you have to do now is tap L and you instantly snap to centerofmass. Not sure why having to bring your gun up start at point A and correct your aim to point B is too much to ask for especially in a multiplayer versus environment. Ive said it before and Ill say it again AUTOROTATION IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST REASON WHY SHOTGUNS AND OTHER HIGHDAMAGE PER SHOT WEAPONS ARE SO ANNOYING IN CQC FIGHTS.

11369220,0,t1_dfklz05,I feel like people are getting greedy now.

I just dont know why people cant be happy they are trying this change out. And yeah ultimately its a way for them to try and boost revenue but that is the objective butter of the business world and at the end of the day DICE and Ea are in business. If anyone needs a squad we usually have a spot on xb.

11387700,0,t3_62g4j9,Great post.  My humble suggestions from a guy in his s who isnt great on a consolehave him try support or medic.  Medic in particular doesnt need those kills to halo the team and score huge points.  Throwing medic pouches around like candy and learning how to revive around objectives will gain him lots of points and really help the team.  Rifle suggestions for him would be the Autoloader Extended crazy fast fire rate and large magazine and the Rigotti on semi.  C or Taschenpistole for handguns bc theyre fast and fun.   I think this class helps you learn maps really well too. support also offers good points for resupplying everyone and will get him on the VIP screen at the end.  Use the pouches and throw them everywhere.  MG lightweight or BAR Storm work great.  The Suppressive. Arianas also work well if you set up with the bipod.  Learn to mortar well or have him blow stuff up with the limpet.  assault with a shotgun in hand I suggest the M Backbored is easy for anyone to pick up.  Have him use an antitank loadout and hell feel important when hes taking out tanks.  The aim is more forgiving as well with tanks haha.  For the joystick just tone down the sensitivity a bit until hes more used to it and then bring it up slowly.  Also there are a couple settings in there to mess with that I cant remember right now like the dead zone adjustment he will want it at  or lower...though too low and it messes up the ads.  I think mine is at . Good luck! ,battlefield_one,dfmrz2p,1,t5_3eer4

11401580,0,t1_dfmyl6e,When I say not terrible Im more using the final scoreboard as the determining factor and not KD rate. I could sit in my spawn with a sniper rifle and probably have a high KD rate but I wouldnt say thats being a good player.But to answer your question probably a combination of mediocre skill and play errors. I tend to rush at tanks with a limpet in my hands like an idiot so that kills me a bunch. But its so darn fun to hit a tank with one that I cant stop.I check corners and whatnot but oftentimes I just cant see the guy hiding in the corner  feet away.Im pretty aggressive. I tend to rush at objectives and that gets me a lot. I could be a little more patient at that.I could do a better of of constantly moving. When I stand still maybe I get some good shots on a couple people down below but Im a magnet for sniper fire.I also tend to use the mg which loses to about everything on. I like the BAR but I get caught in magazine changes too much with it.Im sure Id get more kills if I ducked down and waited on hightraffic areas but thats just too boring for me and I dont like to do it. Thats maybe the biggest reason for my low KD.I played five games last night and got most flags captured twice and most resupplies another two times so all in all I think thats pretty decent.,battlefield_one,dfocsck,1,t5_3eer4

11430633,0,t1_dfrmo1c,Both BF and  made you load the map after the postmatch screen. They were also less demanding especially on the CPU. Loading it during the match screen speeds up game time even then its arguably too much downtime between matches.BF and  also used battlelog which was horrible at first. Now theyve switched to ingame and so obviously features will be missing. Although in typical Dice fashion theyre taking their sweet time with some basic stuff I agree. So no its not just newer version of the same engine. This doesnt excuse gameplay features missing but for the menus its somewhat understandable.The quit button did disappear at first then everybody complained that it did and they put the current one in. Make up your damn minds. This is all about load times Im on PC with a good SSD and loading is near instant and quiting takes a second. Demanding games like this need an SSD if you want good load times. So its either wait less between games or quitting whenever during postmatch screen which is better for the gameplay experience is debatable.,battlefield_one,dfrnf2e,3,t5_3eer4

Truth is the gun will never be bad because you cannot beat roffast reloadhipfire. You remove either of those say make it good rofreload but bad hipfire and its still good. You have to remove two of those to give it a substantial nerf but then who really gives a fuck because everybody who uses it would just switch to shotguns or Hellreigels.DICE will eventually realize that the Automatico is good because the rest of the weapons suck in CQ give each class a better hipfirecq oriented weapon and it will even out a little.,battlefield_one,dfwcc3z,7,t5_3eer4

11569272,0,t1_dg7b4ve,gt  I think Giants shadow is the best tdm map because it has flow to it.  WOAH WOAH WOAH.  Did you just call Giants Shadow the best TDM map? Dafuq dude its the worst.  Not only that the map design encourages players to camp in the houses or on the roofs of the houses or on the map borders. The real bad thing about this map is the spawn system. You cant predict where the next enemy is or where he would spawn because they spawn everywhere without any system. You spawn somewhere run into a direction where you heard shots and then get killed from where you spawned. This map is really just the worst TDM of all time.    I agree that there is also a problem at gueesing where the enemies spawn on Suez and Sinai but it only is a problem on Sinai because there you sometimes have to walk a lot not like on Suez. On Suez can you fastly get from one point of the map to any other but on Sinai this isnt the case especially with the spawn way out of the city where the water tower is.    And i agree that it isnt a good design too have Fao Fortress and Ballroom BLitz the way it is because when you hold the upper ring on ballroom blitz you have a guaranteed win and when you hold the highest tower on Fao with the two towere attached to it than you also have a guranteed win but for me is it fine that it is how it is on these maps because i just then play sniper and take advantage of these spots.  But i rly dont think that you have an advantage when you hold the mountain side on Monte Grappa. More likel does the team win that holds the fortress because you can easily kill enemies on the mountains because you have plents of cover and  a lot of places you can kill them from with the windows in the fortress.    The only problem i have with AMines is that people sometimes camp in the room which is where B is on conquest or that they start camping in the houses. Its not too bad but it would be cooler without the camping.    And i have to agree with your opinion that Empires Edge is pretty good. It actually can be a really bad map when one team decides to play in a special way. First of all the spawns on this map are really bad.  reason for that is that the very first spawn is not fair because  team spawns at the door which is at the tower of the fortress and the other team is splitted up while  spawn is near the door on the other end. So  team has a better chance at campturing the fortress bc they all spawn at the door. Then the spawns later in the match are just horrible. Sometimes you spawn on the site which is at the map border nearest to the conquest points D and C. There you can directly be shot from the tower. Sometimes you spawn at the blue doors which can be locked and when you have no explosives than you have to run around the map. Also ius this map pretty much used for camping which sucks. So there are  ways people play this map. Either they are having close combat in the fortress which is a good way or they are camping where  team is in the fortress and  is outside and they shoot eachother. This takes super long and is super boring and the team in the fortress has an advantage.    And i think that Argonne could be a really good map because it has no real camping support but like you said it is sometimes clusterfucky when  team is on the map part where the house is and theyy just have to watch  entrances. Also is it pretty annyoing to run around on this map bc u get stuck everywhere.    And i am surprised that you mention Grand Bazar and Seine crossing as BF maps but NOT Kharg Island but especially Noshar Canals the best TDM map ever in a BF title.  Like Noshar Canals is just perfect. You have the mid where most of the action happens and you have the outer ring where you spawn in cover and can quickly get in the mid. The mid provides movement porn with all the containers. I just loive this map and would love a  remake but with WW theme textures.,battlefield_one,dg7ds6j,2,t5_3eer4

11598424,0,t1_dgam52s,Good to know about your opinion mate. But if you ask me I would oppose to what you said. Topping the leaderboard with a fairly high difference requires score and kills. Score and kills mean you are PTFOing. Its a pretty simple equation. PTFO doesnt only mean rushing like a maniac towards objectives. It also means the fact that you kill people defending that objective.Okay. Let me give you a scenario so that you understand this much better. We are squad in the midst of a war and we are given an objective to secure area X. Your objective is to secure that area. Would you and your squad rush to the objective like maniacs and make sure they all know they are being attacked and get taken out in a few minutes? Or would you go and flank them or snipe them out simultaneously? Or take a plane a bomb them? You see. That is playing the objective. So in a nutshell killing enemies that would be defending or attacking an objective is PTFOing as you are helping your teamsquad to move forward.,battlefield_one,dgaoujg,0,t5_3eer4

11619703,0,t1_dgd3h8v,hazard not only affects plane it also affects all infantry all tanks and all planes. Everybodys long range ability gets hampered.    AGAIN I want to tell you that people are only yelling about trench variant fighter because it is too good at ALL aspects. Because it does not help ground troops. if attack planes are equally good at killing armor and air it will be the attack planes that gets the hate Fighter only benefits pilot themselves. no enemy planes  free infantry kills if you gets shot down by infantry you are probably just bad at flying.Heck most of my attack planes kills are killing shitbuckets that totally ignores me and go bomb infantry. A lot of them even said I should not even fight them and farm infantry as well. If you still dont understand what the majority of community wants please play more infantry.,battlefield_one,dgd3rc9,2,t5_3eer4
11621171,0,t1_dgd8yk4,.  when an infantry die from a plane they should be able to punish planes using their skills like the past battlefield games. When the helis make the mistake of flying too low you are able to punish my RPG to the face. kill dead. infantry has no way of killing plane except shooting at planes and hope you shoot it enough so it goes away and not die from it. They should be able to use their skills to complete kill a plane right now it is simply impossible. Which is not ok.. unfortunately you did not realize that attack plane is good at anything. it does squeeze bomber and dogfighter out of the sky. from the past month i can only remember less than  of a time an enemy fighter is a dogfighter and there is NO bomber on the map. sorry. but that is it.Furthermore in the interview the devs explicitely mentioned that the planes in the game has the follow their rolls and they are designed to be paper sizer rock. They mentioned there would be  types of planes ground attacks killing other planes and anti armorplanes. trench fighter violate this design rule which is why it is the undeniable king of the sky.You mentioned that It sounds like you have the opinion it shouldnt be effective at killing troops at all. A lot of people seem to share this opinion. I would like to disagree. have you not realize what you are saying? inductive argument suggests that to me.. Where is your i have definitive prove that a squad of supports can kill planes. You fly planes I fly planes. How often do you get killed by LMGs? In my memory  times in my almost  days of flying. The problem is that infantry can kill planes. I gets shotdown by Stationary AA often as a attack plane by rarely as a fighter. Simply put infantry need a way to kill fighter. Or fighter should not have such a big impact on the ground.. It is prob my misunderstanding of your argument. But the whole vibe coming from you gave me that assumption that u dont think what most people said is right.. If you listen to most peoples complaint it is not because trench fighters fly very fast and difficult to kill it is a skilled trench fighter kills the other team repeatedly. Why are you defending against this? you should know what an unskilled trench fighter vs a skill trench fighter. how many of the fighters you kill are just swing in a loop? Have u been able to win a game single handly because their pilot is bad? this is what the community dont want. I also dont like this because when i go like this i feel sorry. it is not what it is supposed to be. instead of supporting infantry you directly kill them.. I agree with that planes are not easy to fly. That i can side with you.. unfortunately pilots are a vocal minority. Unlike tanks and air is extremely difficult to balance because of the skill gap. plane  cancer mostly mean that when u see  on the kill cam they feel bad. it is one of the reasons that people quit when playing at air focused map.Pilots are also infamous for shouting extremely loudly and are hated for that. people also cant practice to fly in game because pilots will spam plane spawn. I am a good pilot and I fail to see what you want to convey.In my mind you are probably trying to sayplanes should not be hated. dont jump on bandwagon.was going to write more about what you are trying to convey other than the first point cant think of anythingAgain people dont think plane is general is bad. just trench fighter.

I go with the Mars or No. for the heavy dammage per shot but the Frommerstop is great for spamming  which is useful to finish off an opponent after a rifle shot at close range.  Tripwire is more than a boobytrap  it is also a detection device.  So i keep it portable on Argonne I will put it down on the narrow paths by C to alert me of flanking enemies while I take shots across the bridge.  When I leave a spot Ill pick it up again and bring it to my next flag.

I get pissed off and rage quit this game at least once every time I play Im sure theres some correlation with which map Im on.  Aim assist does nothing and I lose my shit at how often I get OHKd but all my guns seem to just tickle the enemy.  Im so goddamn tired of getting the drop on some asshole v but still getting killed.  I hate that theres no way to fend off a bayonet charge a lot of the time Im able to wheel around and draw down on the guy but oh no the game has already decided my fate.  I mean I could go on at length about all the ways this game pisses me off but Im not going to because at the end of the day I still enjoy it.  All I do is play support or medic and hang in the back and healresupplyrevive.  I get most of my kills anymore with grenade spam and tank driving when Im lucky enough to get that ticket.  If I get on a good team that means I get to PTFO with everyone else but if Im on a shit team I just have to accept that we are probably going to lose because I cant lone wolf those objectives.   Id say my usual scoreboard is a KDR of  and  but I usually score about k on a good team with a bad team its like k conquest.  My only suggestion would be to try out back to basics in the custom games section.  Its nothing but boltaction rifles no tanks and no aircraft.

11671153,0,t1_dgivuav,What Id recommend doing is get started on BF and get used to the weapons and what you like or de well with. Judging by your Csgo rank youll most likely have better aim than the vast majority of players you encounter. What you can do for me is squad up with my group of guys and see how you fare. We dont have the most disciplined approach to the games but as long as you move in the same area as your squad your team will destroy. I used to be LE as well before I quit. ESEA efficacy in the  range typically. Im gonna assume you had a low sensitivity in Csgo? If so youll probably want to raise it up a bit for BF as its not like Csgo where you already know where the enemy will probably be.

11677409,1,t1_dgizy56,I dont think its fair for you to say why people remember BF as a good game or not.I like BF more than this game because it has a better conquest mode better map design combat that isnt RNG spread and better vehicle combat. I had at least  service stars with every weapon and vehicle in the game. It had vastly more variety. It felt like a real battlefield game.All the changes that were made in this game make it feel less like a BF game to me. The linear map design the new ticket system the way vehicles spawn the elite classes the behemoths the grenade spam etc....But no I guess I only like BF because it went from a mess to an enjoyable game.

11680656,0,t1_dgiwdb0,Last week I had a Frontlines battle on Soissons that had been going on for three hours. The enemy was holding us back largely due to two artillery trucks that were camping behind the ridge of a hill and one of the drivers had  service stars with it... . I snuck up there had a teammate spawn on me to help take them down then went in with limpet and AT grenades. We only managed to take one down and damage the other  but then the driver of that truck decides to jump out and attack me on foot  wrong move. I kill them and steal their artillery truck then drive it back to have it repaired. We then proceed to pummel their team in the reverse direction from that same hill myself and a tank hunter landship. In the end they mange to take us down by sneaking up a whole squad on us. But by then its too late the rest of our team has armed the last objective and we win. Never ever leave your tanktruck,battlefield_one,dgk0p17,1,t5_3eer4

In a game where guns can have fire rates of Hz it was far from optimal Counter Strike has Hz servers. Add latency of both players to the mix and you definitely will have a few bullets in limbo that will be calculated with a delay which might result a kill trade.

It can be one of the most devastating guns in the game if you are good with it no matter what the stats are. I feel the same way about the G infantry. Its not the most practical its stats arent the best but it is my favorite and most used gun in the game.

11791711,0,t1_dgwh4px,I usually play DOMTDM when no friends of mine are available to play BF because those arent nearly as teamwork bound as Operations Rush or Conquest.The reloads are lengthy but the players with the Elite Class wont be reloading with enemies in front of them unless they have no other choice... And if you dont have teammates trying to kill him you have no change. If doesnt matter if you have a gas grenade... You throw the gas grenade towards them and guess what? They get out of the radius kill you and get healed...The problem is that DICE refuses to balance these classes independently for these game modes. Which is downright idiotic. No developer in their right mind would want to have such an unbalanced part of their game. These classes were balanced for the bigger scale modes where the Elite Classes arent a problem. But in small scale game modes they are a powerhouse  out of  times.And my ass wasnt kicked. He killed me once... But a lot of people were complaining because the Sentry was standing in areas where it was nearly impossible to kill him. He was in an open area with some cover in the middle and two medics were helping him. It was impossible to kill him because anyone that tried to bayonet charge him would get instantly killed once they were out in the open and when you threw gas he just moved to a different area because the area let them do that.Elite Classes should have a set health at least in these game modes. Give them  Health and dont let them get healed. DICE was inspired by the Heroes system in Battlefront but they didnt take the best off of that system... The fact that the Heroes had a much larger health pool and they couldnt be healed.Also proper teamwork? In TDM and DOM? That must be the hidden th Wonder of the World because I have yet to see it anywhere with randoms. Hell I dont play the large scale game modes ESPECIALLY RUSH alone without friends exactly because there is no teamwork there either...,battlefield_one,dgwmp4l,1,t5_3eer4
11792157,0,t1_dgwo94g,Yeah same here. So much for preordering I cant even play the content I paid for.  Dice has been shooting themselves in the foot so much lately Im seriously considering talking the  guys and  girl whom Ive been playing since bad company  into just migrating either to Titanfall  or something else entirely. Its been made abundantly clear in the past few months that dice is completely out of touch with reality and know really give a fuck about profits while ironically not realizing that the recent changes are actually hurting said profits. ,battlefield_one,dgwoioa,11,t5_3eer4

11795614,0,t1_dgx1q8v,Enough about my asshat Prezzy..I honestly dont care what you think in regards to that. Why are you arguing with me then? Your problems are due to the poor internet infrastructure you are dealing with locally. This problem has arisen now that EA controls all server providerstook away rd party options and are too greedy to do the right thing and provide your region more server coverage. This only highlights the problem inherent with EAs server coverage not Dices new netcode.,battlefield_one,dgx2muw,1,t5_3eer4

11802553,0,t3_68dih9,To be honest dude this isnt that great. Youre only th and the top guy has  more points than you. Looking at your stats you arent super at PTFO.  spm is pretty low putting you in the bottom . As a medic your spm is  which puts you in the bottom . Your orders completed per game is  which is nothing to brag about. Also your heals per minute is . which is OK without being great. Im not trying to hang shit on you but I think youre a way off having bragging rights.Its also worth noting that while KD is not the most important factor in a game it is actually relevant as the opponents get points for your deaths. You have a KD of  meaning you gave  points to the opposition. If all  players did the same youd end up  points worse off. Of course you may have prevented a bunch of points with revives but the point remains that you need to be conscious of your KD without playing solely for it.Good to see you value PTFO its rough but somebody has to do it!,battlefield_one,dgxuzeu,2,t5_3eer4
