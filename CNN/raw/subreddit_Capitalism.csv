952448,0,t1_chcjb5q,The best example for me would be the smartphone industry. For each player to stay competitive they have to create a better product than the other companies hence always coming up with new models of phones and new services.If they werent competitive then they would easily lose sales and eventually die out. If they failed to adapt or provide the right innovation for the market then they would eventually die out. The reward here is survival. Stay competitive and innovative and you live to fight another day. This of course is a very simplistic way of explaining things but thats the basic jist. ,Capitalism,chcjv36,2,t5_2qiyc

1966137,0,t1_ckpw6rx,You are attacking a whole bunch of beliefs that I dont hold. Im not a socialist nor a statist. I am some form of anarchist. Which form I dont rightly know. So you really havent touched on any of my beliefs with this rant. Im opposed to capitalism because it encourages competition over cooperation. True better competition requires some cooperation. But I dont enjoy feeling that all my coworkers employees and managers are my enemies all the time. That leads to mental illnesses across ALL wealth levels of society and is a sever enough problem to trash the entire capitalist system in my opinion. Not that money isnt a useful tool. But a moneycentric marketsociety is probably a bad idea because its shape excessive competition and levels of relative inequality encourage social illnesses. ,Capitalism,ckq4cvc,2,t5_2qiyc

5255457,0,t1_cvj7mnr,That sounds great when you say it like that! D    Can you explain now how that actually applies though? From corporations profiteering to people working long hours but remaining in poverty the system does not seem to have the efficient results promised. When the government has to give so many people food stamps because corporations have moved their enterprises to countries that are easier to exploit growing your own vegetable garden starts looking more efficient than buying in a store. ,Capitalism,cvjgyca,1,t5_2qiyc

5337387,0,t3_3o2t6n,Im not surprised they removed it. Its very rude uses a ton of foul language and is completely sarcastic and angry.While your heart is in the right place if we are going to overcome the collectivist tendencies of our current world we need to passionately present facts without alienating our audience. Bickering and fighting might feel good in the moment but wont sway an opposing viewpoint. Comments like this serve to reinforce the notion that capitalist is a dirty word and people who support capitalism are selfish and rude. Most people have a hard time separating ideas from people. If they dont like the messenger it will be impossible for them to like the message since they wont be able to separate the two. Im happy you have the right ideas but I do think the cause would be better served by being polite to others and engaging respectfully calmly but firmly with those who hold opposing viewpoints. ,Capitalism,cvtws7e,7,t5_2qiyc
5416585,0,t3_3p8fst,This is such typical shallow statist thinking.  There is no application or acknowledgement at the outset of the costs of violence the law of comparative advantage and commitment strategies.Everything is just a crude superficial and empirically incorrect assessment of human behavior which assumes that violence or coercion will be the result of any imbalance of power and that grouping people together into communities magically creates a completely different dynamic....as if we dont routinely witness the will of majorities in a community oppressing the minority.,Capitalism,cw40zuf,3,t5_2qiyc

8083185,0,t1_d4nsn6n,From my understanding even if a British business was not planning to do any business with other EU countries they still had to comply with EU regulations. Which meant anything made for domestic consumption in Britain was still subject to the same excessive regulation. Likewise for anything made for markets besides the EU.If thats the case then sure those businesses which intend to trade with the EU will have to deal with the bad regulations but the deregulation of other goods could make up for the shortterm challenges of new trade deals.,Capitalism,d4omhh7,2,t5_2qiyc

9770019,0,t3_5et9dk,No. Government run healthcare in particular is lower quality and higher cost. Market based solutions provide more abundant more innovative higher quality and less expensive goods and services. Its difficult to see this with healthcare in the United States because pervasive government interference distorts the market. Just compare any other state run industry with the private sector free market equivalent and it becomes much clearer.,Capitalism,dahdd3n,1,t5_2qiyc
