6552782,0,t1_czx3b09,gtCompare this to what is now known as islamophobia. jihadists are killing plenty of people taking responsibility for those killings and proclaiming Allah while doing It. Real measurable metrics.Since you love metrics why dont you run the numbers of Palestinians killed by Israelis over the past  years?  All because Jewish Israelis the only ones that apparently count under Israeli law continue to maintain an apartheid state.,daverubin,czx40r5,3,t5_3a9fx

7009409,0,t1_d1ar50s,Ok so we can agree that legalization isnt a right wing policy. The right wants to regulate drugs through the criminal justice system. The left generally wants to decriminalize drugs some want full legalization and others want state sponsored rehab for users.As someone that believes in full legalization and would prefer decriminalization to the status quo Im clearly on the left for this issue. Is this not an example of how classical liberalism ideas can mesh with the left?,daverubin,d1av2am,1,t5_3a9fx

9744138,0,t1_dadrmlt,I dont think either one of us has the time to write big essay haha but here are some quick points I do take issue with his antiislamic stances and the overall orientalist outlook on the world within actual classical liberalism in general. Sometime I dont know if Dave knows what classical liberalism is. Its already a term and ideology thats existed in political science for decades. Hes concept is very surface level and very narrow to an American context. Which bleeds into his orientalist world view.I would agree that we need to be critical of religion. But we should also think of the systems that create religion or why religion manifests itself differently throughout the world under the different historical constructs. I dont want to get too deep into this but I believe that Islamicextremism is the current manifestation of resistance to American imperialism in the middle east much in the same way that communism was the resistance to American and European imperialism during the Cold War. And lets not forget that Americans helped to support the crushing of secular resistance in the middle east for decades.I dont have the time to detail what orientalism is but here are some brief excerpts from Edward Said. Its his theory and Ill let him speak for itself Please give it a read.  AltRight is a far clearer term than SJW. I dont know what an SJW is unless its used in a derogatory way. An instant dismissal of someones argument without trying to understand it. No one actually calls themselves an SJW unless its to take the word back. AltRight on the other hand is a term selfselected by people on the far right. Thats not a hard one to understand.If we really want honest discussion we need to not dismiss people  by throwing names at them. If Dave or you or whoever wants to have a conversation lets not instantly throw nebulas terms that dont have any meaning other than to put down someone for believing something different. Now Im not saying that you are. Im not saying that that doesnt happen on the left but we cant control what other people do. We can only control our own actions and comments. The way that Dave presents and dismisses people on the regressive left does not endure people to want to speak with him to try and change their mind. I thought thats what we were supposed to do in debate. Not land cheap shots and insult or preach to the choir but try to change minds. Dave has an opportunity to do that. Sort of like how civil you and I are being. I dont think weve thrown terms at each other even though Im sure that everyone who watches Dave would call me an SJW regressive leftist or cuck if they actually knew my views on issues. He could try to take a sympathetic view of who he disagrees with even if they dont take one with him. If he chooses not to then its clear that he has an agenda hes trying to promote.That includes Dave. He doesnt have to be dismissive of other people and he doesnt have act as a safe space for people who hold say racist views just for the discussion. As an aside I would recommend reading Imagined Communities by Benedict Anderson. Its a great book that deconstructs the ideas of nationalism. Ive been recommending it to a lot of people lately and great discussions have come from it. ,daverubin,dae6dvv,2,t5_3a9fx

11051551,0,t1_dej56hy,gtWhere I live we have a universal health care system one of the ways they bring the cost down is by throttling servicesThat may be so however on the whole its completely unambiguous that in typical situations that both the quality and price of healthcare are better under universalsocialisedsinglepayer systems. Countless studies have been done into this and almost always the US ends up outside of the top ten despite spending the most per capita spent on healthcaregtWhich means that if you are healthy i.e. not in risk of losing your life to your condition immediately you may have to wait up to two years for a MRI scanIs this not a better allocation of resources though? Im sure that its also rare for the US healthcare system to be operating at full capacity except you can be assured that care is being delegated in priority of need not whos willing to pay the most money. The incentive structure of private healthcare is far too perverse for the system to ever function in any kind of an efficient waygtWhat is not obviously true is to what extent it is humans responsibility and whether we can do anything to stop it  moderate it and whether our meddling is going to be cost effectiveThis is certainly valid discussion free market v government solutions is an actual conversation that can be had with ones feet planted firmly in reality. What I mainly take issue with are people who refuse to even reach to that point and insist instead to debate on established scientific fact when the conversation should have long ago shifted on to the aversion of climate change. ,daverubin,dekoa54,1,t5_3a9fx
11225838,0,t1_df2cmei,I cant think of a time that Colin has tried to showcase his uniqueness. So Im not sure where the snowflake comment comes from.And as far as livestreams go the chat was there for people with views opposite to Colins to challenge his belief and there were some did you watch the video?. So not really sure how it was a safe space either.Unless you were just using those words because theyre the words people who arent on the ctrlleft use against typical ctrlleft antics?But even then I dont see how it adds to conversation.Could you please elaborate?,daverubin,df4fnjt,5,t5_3a9fx

11581903,0,t1_dg8pj0a,Okay so Ive listened to about half of Daves podcasts and I have never heard him say I believe we should get rid of the EPA let alone think he actually does believe that. Reduce the scale of the EPA maybe but not ax it all together. He believes in climate change for fucks sake. This dude probably wants to get rid of the EPA though. In this interview they go on to say how IF we did some companies would still dump chemicals into the rivers and if we were to actually get rid of the EPA we would need other reforms to help people affected by their adverse effects because social media alone wouldnt prevent these companies from doing this although it would have SOME effect. This is all hypothetical. This dude hes interviewing is waaayyyy more of an extreme libertarian than Dave is and Dave is just kind of going along with it to facilitate the discussion. The whole point of the show is to get people to explain why they believe what they believe and if Dave objected to every single view point that he did not agree with this show wouldnt work. If you believe Jason Stapleton is a retarded fuck great! He his pretty crazy. but Daves not here to call people idiots even if they are. If thats what you want find a different show.,daverubin,dg8tdb9,1,t5_3a9fx
