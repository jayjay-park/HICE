10846438,0,t1_ddy5a63,I think this sub is a great idea but in some sense there is an inherent doom and gloom the backdrop to this one just isnt a happy one. For my part snarky searing and occasionally selfdeprecating humor has played a big role as a coping mechanism. ,CollapseSupport,ddyqfhr,1,t5_3j5d3
10870176,0,t3_5vc559,Oh jeez I probably discovered rcollapse when I was . Im  now. It really fucked with him head. I didnt want to believe any of it but there was so much evidence I always ended up coming back and browsing the forum. It seemed like such a problem for my future self and that I could just keep pushing it off. Now it seems too real and Im having a hard time adjusting my own lifestyle in response to it. Its part of the reason I started this sub.It doesnt help that I have a family history of depression an aunt who took her own life but Im not here to play the victim. My life is filled to the brim with privilege. What about you uMicaMtnGirl?,CollapseSupport,de16j8c,2,t5_3j5d3
