47593,0,t3_1ubpdx,I have an MBA no formal GIS training.  My family buys and sells a lot of very large timber tracts.   years ago I started working in the family business and taught myself ArcMap and have become very proficient at using it for timber management tasks but that is about it. Although I have gone to the last  Esri User Conferences and learned that there is a whole bunch I dont know.I got out of the family business and started a technology company designinghosting websites small business networking hosted PBX etc....  recently I have been getting lots of freelance work updating and creating forest maps for land owners.Is the freelance market for GIS not HUGE?   Just wondering why I dont see or hear more about freelance GIS work.  It seems like there is an untapped market of people that have a need for GIS without having full time GIS staff or paying the handful of big firms the big bucks.,gis,cejukgl,1,t5_2qmpb

585341,0,t1_cg6rjuc,Let me try and break it down for you like a developerYou can boil GIS down to analysis libraries and rendering libraries.  QGIS is the most popular and feature rich front end gui for the top open source analysis and rendering libraries.  PostIGIS is essentially middleware that sits on top of the postgresql RDBMS.   It allows you store geometry datatypes in the database and provides functions for analysis.  It also uses some of the most popular open source GIS libraries under the hood.  It performs very well and has support for more functions than most commercial competitors.  QGIS can connect to PostGIS and use it as a back end data source.  QGIS and PostGIS are powerful open source tools for GIS developers.   However you also have access to the same libraries that these applications are built on top of.  ,gis,cg6t2u9,3,t5_2qmpb

1603520,0,t3_2cnkyf,You need to rewrite your code so that python is periodically saving your output. That means you should write a certain amount of lines to your output file  lets say  close it save it then reopen for appending. If you dont do that everything youve done will stay in memory and not to a file. Put your code within a loop that does this.Also you might want to consider an exception handler. We all know that address data is not perfect. Add a Try Except block so that when a error occurs it skips over a few lines and continues normally. Usually this will happen somewhere within the street address unit number area of the address line.Im sorry but Ive not looked closely at your code but am somewhat certain that you arent saving your output file which will cause python to error out when there is no memory left to use,gis,cjhajag,3,t5_2qmpb

3050766,0,t1_coe4h5n,Thanks for the reply. Thats what I am leaning toward for simplicity sake. We are an oyster farm and culture the oysters using surface techniques so we have hundred and in the future thousands of lines with product of different year class sizes stocking densities etc...  We operate in several different areas and as we develop hope to have operators on site doing their work and recording where the different product has been placed and what work has been done treatment for fouling grading. We are currently tracking the line numbers and what is on them now but not the ongoing work that is being done. With pen and paper one operators notes may not be understood by another and we want to consolidate all information so that if one person were sick or on vacation that another could quickly pickup to know what needs to be done on that site and what lines to harvest if applicable. In the other applications although much larger farms the boat captains have tablets that they can see what position they are at on a line and can record all this data in real time. The information is sent to a central location and the owner of that company can track the locations of his employees what work is being done gauge what product is large enough to harvest classify inventory as per size and location and manage each operator or site based on what needs to be completed. I think there is a trade off between the amount of time energy and cost required to develop and maintain such a system with the flexibility they have versus a simple system that can store some information and still use the old manual methods of tracking. That being said we are trying to expand and my worry is that in  or  years we get to the point where we have a greater need for the more comprehensive system and kick ourselves for trying to implement it at that stage rather than when we were growing and could have slowly worked our way into it.

If you want to get really tricky you can attempt to deobfuscate the javascript grab the bounds of the tile and run some sort of imagemagick analysis to grab your poly in question. That being said the geometries are simplified at lower zoom levels so whos to say youre getting the true geometry.Source Use google maps API everyday. TLDR Get your data elsewhere. Its way easier.

3455080,0,t1_cplf7wg,Sorry this is a printing company who was uninterested? What format did they want STL? The conversion is the real pain in the ass. Can you tell me what use you would have made of the print?Costs and sizes are TBD. Because Im doing research the people Ive spoken to are mainly interested in costrecovery for filament. Size would be determined by the printer bed average xish but varies but I suppose you could do multipart prints.Im not looking to go into business with this but maybe I will if theres interest. At this point Im mainly interested in working through data conversion issues and comparing the results of working from heightmaps vs. contour lines. There are a few processes online that pull SRTM data but as a Canadian looking at Canadian areas thats not sufficiently detailed for what Im trying to do.Another important question to research will be the resolution required will be determining minimum amount of detail to print something that looks like anything. For example if youre looking to print erosion gullies what kind of resolution do you need in the data to create a model that looks like anything? For example would SRTM USGS CanTopo OBM etc. data be sufficient or would you be looking at a more detailed custom survey to create a usable model? At my university there are a few people looking to print mineshafts but theyd be doing that with point clouds made with laser scanners I forget the name of the tech off the top of my head.In general re colour in D printing I know its something that can be done but adds to cost so unless there were a compelling reason not to Id presume that painting the model would be the way to go.,gis,cpm3stk,1,t5_2qmpb

You can load your own data points lines or polys  This is helpful if you have some reference data you want to overlay behind your tableau polygons. Do you write python?

The digitizing of the footprint looks great as well as all the other digitized features.. parking spots sidewalks trees etc Are you familiar with building lean? it happens because the camera taking the photo of the building is not directly overhead and as a result is able to see a face or two of the structure. It has the unwanted effect of making the rooftop of tall buildings lean far out beyond its footprint obscuring things behind as well. in cities like New York they take thousands of photos covering every building from every angle then they math the crap out of the photos and stick them together in a way which hides the fact that the image of any given building rooftop was compiled from sometimes dozens of images containing building lean.,gis,cw5ldky,9,t5_2qmpb

6727852,0,t1_d0f7k4m,Im not sure where you are getting the idea that Portal is more GISlite than ArcGIS Online.  You have it exactly backwards.  If anything  AGOL is Portal lite. Portal is literally AGOL taken off the cloud and hosted within your architecture.  This requires all sorts of network configuration  Server to host Portal  probably a server for named user store Active Directory  a website server to host your applications  ArcGIS Server to host your services  etc.  Every viewer  application  web map  user interface that youve been shown in Portal is there in AGOL...except in the cloud.  You dont need to ownmaintain those servers and infrastructure.I may be talking in circles but the key point is Portal is a much  much more complex product that isnt necessary except in certain infrastructures.  You do not have a need to even consider Portal unless your users are kept in network and cannot access the web.  Please feel free to PM me or continue with questions here.

I dont know exactly what you guys are hoping for in terms of output or what your priorities are. But if you want longterm accessibility low maintenance and ease of use ArcGIS online might be a good resource. Its cheaper than ArcGIS Server would be but a whole lot easier than the Geoserver route. If youre staying within the realm of education you can also probably get special pricing.That said Id think geoserver would be adequate but I cant say for sure. You havent really quantified what fast and slow mean to you. Plus we dont know what you mean by calculations  are you expecting intensive geoprocessing or just a few basic analyses? Youll want to be mindful of the server and connection resources as those will probably play a much bigger role than the difference between arcserver and geoserver. ,gis,d1dugl8,5,t5_2qmpb

We had to take a global class cultural or economic geography the basics of GIS that also had the basics of cartography a bunch of other classes that all tied together and then a senior seminar where we got hot and dirty with the philosophical side of geography and how we relate to other fields. You come out or you should come out of a geography degree being fairly well rounded when it comes to paper writing being culturally aware and mostly things that look good if you know how to write a resume. Geography is critical thinking with maps and it leads into almost every other humanities field history psychology archaeology almost anything that can have data attached to you can apply geography to. As for my GIS job I got incredibly lucky with the one I have. I went to a job fair I wasnt expecting to go to and hit it off with both of the people who happen to be managers now and I was an intern for a year and a half and they hired me full time three months before I graduated. That being said GIS is a growing field there are a ton of practical applications and while some are more technical than others which is why the GIS minor or certificate tend to be required also help yourself learn Python and SQL. The private sector jobs tend to be in larger cities thats where I got lucky just over  people in this town and it homes a prosperous GIS company but there are small government jobs all over the place. Definitely look for internships a lot of people I know had internships they did in the lab and didnt have to drive off campus for others worked for governmental agencies over the summer. There is a census coming up and whatever department is in charge of that is sounding a lot desperate at this time. Whatever you decide to do remember you get as much back as you put in.

8363433,0,t1_d5mpe9l,edit tldr you cant just learn GIS like you can Word and expect to use it properly  many think you can.Ive known people who just pick it up and learn it like any other software to create maps and run analyses to solve some problems. The issue is that they dont know what theyre doing they use the wrong data old garbage or incorrectly created andor they use the wrong analysis or data management tools. The end up with a product DB map analysis etc. that they then use to make decisions. Potentially incredibly important decisions based on absolute garbage. GIS is way more than clicking buttons to make spatial stuff happen and a lot of people dont get this.Im not denying that it is a tool but it is a high precision tool that requires knowledge skills and experience to use correctly.    A poor example I can figure out how to use a hammer and saw and use that knowledge to build a garage. However that will be the worst constructed garage and it will bite me in the  later when it collapses and destroys my car. god forbid if I want to put electricity in!

9501890,0,t1_d9jcfvs,Substations and switchyards arguably the most key components to a regional power grid are pretty easy to spot on aerial photos.  Unless theyre underground or inside of buildings  as they are in some urban areas in which case they are much harder to find.You could cruise around on Google Earth find a couple digitize their locations and use that as a place to do your risk assessment based on other more publicly available data.If that doesnt sound fun which it doesnt heres a list of power stations in the NYC region You could use the coordinates from that to do a risk analysis of the generation locations  it looks like most of them have a substation attached to them as well.  With projects like these it often becomes more about you demonstrating that you can do some analysis and less about what the question you are trying to answer.  If you want to look at potential vulnerabilities in the power grid for a region you need to identify what those vulnerabilities are and then how you will use GIS to identifymodel them.For example lets say you want to look at power generation sites that are most susceptible to damage from flooding.  In order to do that you need to figure out how you are going to model areas that are prone to flooding use a DEM?  Hydrology tools?.  Then youre going to look at your power generation sites and how they relate to that flooding data spatially.  So your doing one thing flood risk analysis and applying it to another power generation sites.  Sometimes it helps to look at the task that way  What data do you have ready access to and how can you use it?  Then ask yourself how you can apply that data to something else  then poof you have a nice project on your hands.,gis,d9kb6va,1,t5_2qmpb

10221644,0,t3_5mbuj5,In my experience Canada just based on people I know students who took cartography ended up working more datacentric jobs because there simply arent enough straight carto jobs to go around. That being said unemployment was very low because they were stilled trained as GIS techs in the program they were in. Im not involved in cartographic tasks every day but I do enjoy the days that I am. Despite the fact that Im usually crashing through making piles of maps at a time its more low stress than running through scripts and tables imo. I will say that utseepra is right if youre a carto student you should be trying to improve your background GISprogramming skills. If you can make a pretty map.. thats good if you can use a program like ArcGIS to batch that task with data driven pages or something and make  pretty maps at once.. thats great. Also familiarize yourself with cloud based services for sure. Right now Im responsible for keeping several field personnel up and running with ArcGISs mobile apps and online services. They go out and survey forestry operations the data is uploaded to the cloud downloaded to me and I make the maps.

10695168,0,t3_5sv8sh, Variables should be all lower case.  Use an underscore to separate words.  This is a best practice thing and so you can obviously do what you want but you should at least be consistent.  You have variables that start with capitals like Hab and variables that are camel case like inTable  pick one format.  You can google PEP  for more detail. You only need one SearchCursor loop for the Get Polygon ID and Get polygon Area loops. You declare the variable fieldName Perc and then proceed to hard code the string Perc in Hab row.getValuePerc.  Why not just Hab row.getValuefieldName? You get a lot of variables in their native types and also declare a variable for it as a string.  No need to do this if you arent using both often e.g. when you get the polygon ID just use one variable for it IDstr strrow.getValueID.  Dont store ID since you never use it.  Alternatively and as you could do for variables which you do use in calculations e.g. Hab dont assign the string variable and call the to string function in the report as ...  Habitat Percentage   strHab You have already imported the whole arcpy importing env from it is redundant. The ID you display is the last polygon in the first search cursor since you loop through all of them and reset the ID variable each time.I havent had ArcMap for a year now so im a bit less familiar with the arcpy specifics and the correct way that addins work.

10781264,0,t3_5u47d9,Just finished with my masters in GIS at NCSU which can be done entirely online if you want  I was an on campus student though I took many online courses and I dont think a masters does much for you employment wise. Most job postings I see are for people with bachelors and experience. Experience goes a very long way while the MS degree might give you a slight pay bump. Definitely doesnt set you apart when applying to jobs though unfortunately Im currently applying to jobs and its pretty crappy out there... the reason I did an MS in GIS is because I wanted to switch fields and bit and getting another bachelors would take the same amount of time as getting a masters so I opted for the MS.As far as a UW program I got my undergrad degree on campus and I loved every minute of it. I havent heard anything negative about any of their degree programs. My undergrad degree was not GIS though. And Ive never heard of this online GIS masters before so it must be new within the last two years which could be a bit of trouble in terms of course development. I took some electives when doing my MS degree where I was part of the first bunch to ever take the class the class had never been offered before and it was buggy so to speak. It might depend on the instructor but mine was a bit disorganized and things she wanted to do didnt go as planned which might not happen if the course had been developed over a period of years.,gis,dds0c0e,0,t5_2qmpb

But you will have to be aware of cartographic distortions  Any time you project your map to a projected coordinate system what you normally see on real printed maps your continents will look very different than how you originally drew them.Its really hard to explain a lot of the nitpicky things when it comes to coordinate systems which is why most if not all of us here have some kind of formal education in GIS.The problem here is that GIS as a discipline is fundamentally designed to represent the earth and the things in it as accurately as possible given that it is a real physical object from which we can measure a maps accuracy.  There is very little if any consideration given to using it to create a fictional world.  You could use a GIS software to create a fantasy map but unless you are planning to create an actual physical globe out of it then in my opinion it would be a waste of your time to learn how to use it because you would essentially just be using it as a massively overcomplicated graphic design software.,gis,de62kdx,2,t5_2qmpb
