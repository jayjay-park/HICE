1408186,0,t1_cisbo4i,Thank you for your message its really helpful. I think what hurt most recently was how she was behaving when out at the same places as me i.e. a gig i was playing at. She gotten herself pretty drunk and I couldnt really stand to watch so just sat in my car until I was due to play. Meanwhile one of my bandmates spoke to her as shed asked him what he thought of her hes normally one to tell it as he sees it and someone else as well apparently but I dont know who to which she later came and apologised to me and we hugged a fair while as she didnt want to let go. She told me she had a lot to tell me but obviously now wasnt the time. At the same time it felt great my mates could see right through the situation and were looking out for me its something she has seemingly been a bit naive to when hanging out with everyone i ever introduced her to as shes just wanted to act like everythings still normal which is understandable but not really realistic. Since then I think shes realised her recent actions as much as she cant help them at times havent really helped me and shes in danger of pushing a lot of people away not sure how that made her feel at first but shes a pretty sensible girl and shes appeared a lot happier this week. This weeks probably the first week in ages Ive actually felt normal again because of that I guess and knowing that she has stuff to tell me at some point somehow fills me with some sort of hope but i wont push her for it Ill just wait until shes ready. She means the absolute world to me and I guess this is one way of proving it to her by being patient and being there if and when she needs me its also given me time to think about what Id do better in the relationship next time if we were to be together again. I knew I had to look after myself from the start of the brake up and I think Ive done ok for myself so far I hold no complete expectations and Im always thinking about what Im doing in the near future with or without her Ill enjoy my life either way. Thanks again and I hope things also work out for you.,BreakUp,cissni7,1,t5_2r8tk
1963682,0,t3_2h5mhs,It aint easy bro. Sometimes remembering the love trust and intimacy you had with an ex can be like a hit to your chest that leaves you breathless and all you can remember is her face and how she meant the world to you. But it would be weird if you didnt feel like that. Getting comfortable with the situation may take awhile. Imagine if you did have sex with her. Imagine if the relationship lasted longer then ended. It world hurt alot more than how it currently does and you should be grateful for that tbh. Now look at your current situation. Youre single you are traveling youre experiencing things most people can only dream about and I bet you are pretty good looking too. Take these advantages in stride and use them to your advantage. With the right attitude you can find what is best for YOU. Feeling guilt and regret over something that didnt happen is just going to eat at you and will never help.,BreakUp,ckptq9l,6,t5_2r8tk

3315240,0,t3_2xw0ww,You should understand all the stereotypes around dating someone in the military so that probably scares her plus im guessing you guys will end up doing long distance. I dated someone on the Navy once it was hard really hard not just cause of the distance but everything else that came with it. Im not saying by amy means that its impossible just that not everyone is down with it. Idk how long you guys have been dating but you should talk to her on a quiet place where you both have time to express your opinion but if you want yours to be respected do the se with hers only if you still want her back. If not all you can do is let time pass and it will heal eventually probably your job will keep your mind busy and that works  exercise and try to go out instead of staying on bed on your free time.

3690894,0,t1_cqcz8al,Yeah i see.. Do NOT feel like a failure for not being over him yet do not let him make you feel that way. Its only natural to be sad as shit after a breakup. You obviously had more feelings invested in this relationship than he did so its completely normal that youd take a while longer getting over it. I can assure you though no matter how shitty it feels still after  months  it will and i promise you this get better! Get up in the morning do whatever you do normally live your life as if everythings fine. Not saying you should forget that you were ever in love with this dude dont hate him for breaking up and moving on. Cherrish the time you two spent together and try being happy that hes getting along. I know its tough i wanted to hate my ex for a shitload of stuff for a long time and walking around hating them and being mad just does not help!

3768672,0,t3_33hgph,You have to remember that people come and go in life even the ones that you love the most. The pain of loss is only temporary as much as it is hard to sink in right now. I would use to wake up in the middle of the night and sob to myself the breakup. I felt lost and confused without a partner to be there for me when I needed it. I didnt want to go through day after day without someone to be with me and support me. But we cant let others dictate who and what we are especially since the hurt us. We determine what type of people we are and personally I wanted to become the type of person that could support himself. Realising that my mornings became much brighter. Waking up became an opportunity for a whole experience.Sorry if Im rambling im also still trying to get over her. I think its working!,BreakUp,cqlutys,2,t5_2r8tk

You broke him. Of course he wouldnt just drop everything to get back together with you because he was extremely hurt by you.Why would you consider telling him to go fuck himself? Hes done nothing to wrong you. You say you love him and youre  sure you want to be with him yet youre having a fling with some random guy.,BreakUp,cr8ticp,3,t5_2r8tk

4661577,0,t3_3es0dg,Hey listen.  I know youve heard this a million times but youre young and have a full life ahead of you.  I think youre spot on when you say youre trying to keep yourself busy.  It might even be worth taking an additional step and work on a concept idea hobby that youve always wanted to get good at.  Dont beat yourself up.  Its easy to blame yourself but really its really no ones fault.  I know nothing about you but I am sure youre very capable smart compassionate.  Focus on who you want to be i.e. what kind of person.  Im  sure that if you focus on highlighting your strong points youll meet someone flat out better.  One things I know about breakups is its just not worth analyzing.  The younger me would sit there and go over all these memories events and wonder how on Earth the end result could be reality.  Just dont do it.  For me I accepted that I would never know really what was going through my partners head whether it was fair what they were thinking.  None of it actually helped me and caused me to make assumptions that werent even true.  Maybe youre just flat out better than this guy.  Maybe youre not.  But love is wanting the best for both.  See it as an opportunity to meet someone better.  If youre telling yourself thats impossible then focus on loving yourself first and then meet new people.  Hang in there and remember to take advantage of lifes twists.  Im sure you have a lot going for you.  Its time to discover yourself and youll come out of this a lot stronger happier and confident.  best wishes.,BreakUp,cti5c68,6,t5_2r8tk

4785045,0,t3_3gbgzv,Im really sorry that this happened to you. Almost the exact same thing happened to me we had been dating about two years though and it wasis devastating. The first thing you have to understand is that this immediate change was not totally spontaneous she had been at the very least emotionally cheating on to be ready to hop onto somebody else like that. She expects you to be fine with it by not addressing it. She thinks she can treat you like shit and everything will be kosher. This is where you have to be a man and cut her off. Dont talk text or have any contact. Deleteblock her on all forms of social media and move on with your life. If she was a decent friend she wouldnt have treated you like that  always remember that. Good luck with the uphill battle before you. I am happy to talk more if you would like this would be a good idea since you said you have nobody to speak with. ,BreakUp,ctxp0st,2,t5_2r8tk
4842702,0,t3_3gikjz,Your story is identical to mine minus breaking up over text first. Mine happened the other day. We had issues that I outlined in a message to him and met with him under his insinuation we would talk about them...he sprung that on me instead and only addressed one of the six issues I mentioned.I didnt get proper closure from him and it cut me deep. I called him yesterday and we talked no reconciliation but I got more closure than I was given initially and I do feel a bit better about that.One thing thats helped me immensely today is researching the issue that tore us apart polar opposite opinions when it comes to certain values especially family ones. Reading up on it forced a lot of introspective thinking and its bringing me peace.Give it a try it might help you as much as its helping me.,BreakUp,cu4yjyy,1,t5_2r8tk

Although it was a mutual split I agreed to it because hed be treating me so badly and I couldnt stand certain things about him anymore. It hurts that he wasnt who I wantedneeded him to be but deep down inside I know he wasnt right for me and I was wasting my time. He told me he loved me with all his heart never met anyone that made him him as happy as I did but since deciding were broken up he shows no emotions no efforts to fix things just completely checked out and seemingly unhurt. Break ups suck. Im at a loss of what to do right now and just waiting for the pain to go away.

5680112,0,t3_3sw35x, weeks isnt a long time. I saw a post the other day from a guy wondering why he wasnt over his ex after  days! You shared a lot of life with this person you were emotionally attached...it will take some time to feel  okay. Unless you are a psychopath. So the fact that after  weeks you are still having a hard time means that you are a fully functioning totally normal human being. Maybe it takes  months half a year  year or a couple more weeks...you will feel better and this pain will pass. Going back to work may be a good thing. Back to your routine and something else to focus on. Feeling better isnt linear...you may have good days and bad days. Over time the bad days wont seem so bad and the good days get better. One day you will realize you hadnt thought of your ex at all for an entire week. But you cant rush it. Its okay to be a bit emotionally under the weather in the meantime.

6818671,0,t3_4910xf,I dont know what kind of difficulties he iswas going through but a true loving relationship should make life easier not harder. A relationship is a partnership and you go through things together. It seems like his feelings on you or the relationship has changed or he at least for some reason considered you to be some sort of additional worry that takes effort in which hes not willing to give a true partnership should for the most part be effortless. A difficult time is an opportunity to bring you closer together. Difficult times are when youre there for eachother. Pushing your loved one away when theyre not actively part of your problem is strange.Radio silence might be a bit immature but he might think its the best way to help you get over the situation. He might feel that he was mature enough to tell you that this is not what he wanted and that you contacting him doesnt necessarily require a response because youre not respecting his wishes.? In a sense. You cant make somebody love you and its extremely weird to watch someone that used to look at you as their world suddenly look at you like youre nothing to them. Its as if youve never existed in the first place and nothing you remember ever actually happened. People are scary. The scariest part about loving somebody is the fact that them being by your side is ultimately their choice and they can disappear on you and its somehow not illlegal. You might be going through methods in your head. You want to be the person that is there for them no matter what and you want to be the person who is there for them even when theyre being irrational. Maybe you try to look at all of these different approaches and wonder if there is absolutely anything you can do to win his heart back. What if you gave up today but tomorrows efforts are the ones that would change his mind? Its hard to give up on someone but maybe its what you need to do.It will take a long time before it feels like its truly over. It will always feel like he just hasnt come to his senses yet and youre just waiting for him to realize how much he loves you and how good you were together. There are a lot of people in the world. I realize that it probably feels like I know but nobody else is him but until you knew him he was just another one of those random people.Things do matter. Everything matters.But you cant force someone to love you and stupid brains often make it where the harder you try the less likely they will.,BreakUp,d0p70vy,1,t5_2r8tk

I tried to reach out another time about  weeks ago just in a casual text but no response there either.  The worst part is that Im not getting the closure I need to move on because of the cut off communication.  So literally unless he makes the effort I wont be able to ever talk to him again and thats really upsetting and hurtful.

I have also made the commitment to myself to give up social media for a few weeks. That has prevented me from seeing any posts or pictures of her being happy without me. No social media also gives you time to do other more beneficial tasks. Like exercising talking to old friends doing homework and finding new music!

7739945,0,t3_4lbadv,Its been  weeks for myself as well so I feel I can relate to the heartache.  The best thing that works for me is to seek out support from friends and family or a counselor and just talk it out. Id be happy to offer an ear as well. The more you talk the more youll start to understand what the relationship was and how you can improve yourself from what youve learned. Try not to focus on what she may have done wrong or analyze past memories just focus on where your faults lie and how you can overcome them.   Take it day by day and dont be frustrated if it takes a long time to recover fully and dont be frustrated if one week goes well and all of a sudden youre back to where you were in the beginning in the next. Its for the best to not hope for getting back together with her as itll only lead to self sabotage of your own healing. Its best to just accept its done for good. Other good things to do have already been suggested but its very true to seek out distractions to keep you from being sad all of the time. Your mind will process in the background while you are out spending time with friends immersing yourself in hobbies or even playing video games if thats your thing. But you just need to remember that in order to truly heal you need to just let all of the pain in and ride it out using help from your support system.

7830212,0,t3_4mkccr,Binging shows on netflix most certainly helped me.  At first you cant take your mind off it then you start to realize you went an hour of not thinking about her.  After a while you might go a full day and eventually she will just become a random thought that you will look back and laugh about. ,BreakUp,d3w6ljr,1,t5_2r8tk

8865066,0,t3_50x6yd,Maybe reach out to her and apologize if you havent. Youve clearly come a long way from the person you were. Trying to show her that and letting her know how sorry you are could offer you some peace. Stay strong.,BreakUp,d7dgfvo,1,t5_2r8tk

9015905,0,t3_53e5co,Change the context of that night a little you got high and GAVE her your virginity. She doesnt have the depth of character at this point to empathize with your situation. Girls at that age can be majorly selfish and flaky and also horny. It will get better. Truly it will. Make yourself so busy with other activities that she will become a bad memory then someone that you used to know but rarely think about. It will happen.,BreakUp,d7vkl5i,1,t5_2r8tk
9044184,0,t3_544dqt,yeah I made the same mistake about a month ago when my ex wanted to get together to talk about the possibility of getting back together but then it seemed like he really didnt want to.

9512590,0,t3_5alk2h,somebody reached out to me today and im glad. please dont hesitate to do so. i replied that message and i will be glad to offer support feedback or thoughts to any of you. if you think i can help i will do my best to provide. i thought i should share my message here too with the private part removed. Here it is.There are a lot of things i went through to some degrees i still experience it until today. I still think about her when i wake up or during the day just less frequently and less intense. What has changed was my objectivity. In the last  months I used to think or subconsciously feel that its about level of selfishness the intensity of feelings or other things but i didnt see the bigger picture. I couldnt because with all that happened facts feelings etc i couldnt reconcile them. i cant have that level of objectivity that is needed to see the truth. And at the core Im a seeker of Truth it matters to me like God matters for some people. Without understanding it I feel like i have nothing much in personal sense.With that said i assume its the same with you. You feel like youre in a dim world nothing is clear. My experience basically suggests that you should try to achieve the level of objectivity that is needed to be normal again. I experienced the same thing you went through drowning inside. Did you notice that even before you felt that way you lost some objectivity to the world in general? It got worse when we were drowning.My theory is actually we felt drowning because we lost the healthy level of objectivity not the other way around. It might be that the amount of feelings doubts anger disappointment sadness guilt etc together overwhelmed us with thoughts arises to them we became overloaded it started the loss of objectivity. There was no balance between feelings and thoughts facts and fictions which is what objectivity is about in essence. The key word is balance.This is why people came up with advises on what to do to move on after break ups and the good ones are basically focus on relatively the same thing be positive focus on rebuild yourself your future. Notice that theyre different from advises that are based on subjectivity get a revenge theyre nothing just enjoy your life etc.. In essence regain your balance your objectivity.  I think all the advises were so vary and contradicting because people knows what happening in some degree but most of us cannot not inherently incapable just situational really see the connection between what how and why.The zero that i talked about was probably a bit extreme but it serves to illustrate the principle. Real people cannot really fake love maybe a sociopath can but normal people in general cannot. So if one person in a relationship doesnt really love you herhis effort to that relationship will decreased. In my case i might have exaggerate i dont know how much but i felt safe to say that she never really loved me if she abandon me so quickly twice to the same guy.So i guess my advice to you is do what you have to do in order to gain your highest objectivity. Ignore her perspective ignore social norms you cannot make anything better if you cannot help yourself. Learn to examine yourself trust your instinct but suspicious of some that sounds like ego talking. Do things that are beneficial for you you need to have positivity a normal occurrence in your life.Remember that the key to everything in life is balance. Love cynicism empathy ignorance happiness sadness... everything. Without it theres no meaning. ,BreakUp,d9lmnpk,2,t5_2r8tk
9929947,0,t3_5hntg9,I am not a therapist so take this with the biggest grain of salt. First if you are feeling suicidal please talk to someone. I couldnt find a hotline number google kept giving me American numbers. Maybe try  . Friends and family too!As far as your last question it is absolutely not your fault that he doesnt love you. People fall out of love for a lot of reasons. Many of them dont have to do with the other person. I dont know this person but it sounds like he needs to figure some things out for himself.I would encourage you to talk to a friend and a therapist. They can be really helpful. I would discourage you from interacting with him. It honestly does not help. It sucks at first but you will overcome those feelings.The hardest thing for me was understanding that what I was feeling at the time is not how I would feel forever. Give yourself time and you will slowly start to feel better. Also journaling helped me a lot. Good luck! You can make it through this! Come out on the other side and realize you are worth more than what he offered. ,BreakUp,db1wbae,3,t5_2r8tk
