5556718,0,t3_3r688p,There are  types of winners  of them stemming from how the first couple seasons were edited and one created after Gabon. Type A  Basically the winners that are edited as being the mastermind behind everything the Why X won way of editing Kim Richard TonyType B  These are the UTR winners that got very little focus and the edit focuses more on Why X lost or why the other person in the finale lost Natalie Danni VecepiaType CC  These are the MOR winners that were relevant present but still hidden and were just generally there. C was the positivelyedited winners Tom Ethan Sandra PI C was the negativelyedited ones Jenna Sophie ArasType D  These are the winners who are hidden early on but then become more of the mastermind at the merge Parvati Chris Sandra HvsVType E  Appropriately named the WTF winner that nobody expected Bob Fabio are the only examples.Theres definitely wiggle room. I dont really think theres a set way to classify the winner edits because Ive seen people group winners differently. Some argue that Bob and Fabio are Type C. Some dont even make the distinction between C and C. And Ive seen a completely new winner model on Sucks recently that takes out the Type E completely and splits Type A into Type A Mastermind and Type A Emerging Leader. The Type A accounts for the recent trend in editing to downplay the overbearing mastermind edit and giving them a slow start Kim Tyson Natalie A. while also reclassifying some of the MOR winners into leaders Tina Tom Brian JT.,Edgic,cwlv1h3,8,t5_3808p
6716846,0,t1_d0e2ngh,Anna felt similar to Aubry for me. No confessionals no engagement in the Beauty tribe story for the week but she was pretty big in the Previously on... in narrating the girls alliance her trust of Tai then her mistrust of Tai. Im feeling UTRlow on her myself,Edgic,d0e2w2m,2,t5_3808p
9184289,0,t1_d8g6a2y,Understood. Im still learning to look for these patterns so your insight is appreciated,Edgic,d8g6chx,2,t5_3808p
9418368,0,t3_59lati,I think a male will definitely win this season. Hannah Sunday and Jessica have all had very weak edits up to this point. Michelles elimination seems more certain each episode and I think she will be voted out next. Michaela probably goes far but her edit is in the fan favorite category instead of the strategywinner category.,Edgic,d99udbx,1,t5_3808p

9660505,0,t1_da3uxbt,Yeah Im pretty new to the whole concept myself having only really gotten into the online community last year but the previous three seasons were muuuuch more textbook than this lol,Edgic,da3uycp,2,t5_3808p
9667031,0,t1_da3ne6v,Its one of those things... how much do you weigh the first two episodes vs the middle of the season? For me personally I tend to lock in early favorites because I dont see the edit really ignoring or downplaying a winner right out of the gate. So Im less likely to jump on a latesurging AubryCydney edit when their early episodes werent great compared to Michele. On the other hand though thats what kept me championing Jon Misch long after Natalie had surpassed him in terms of winners edit.Im really torn on Ken. He feels like the best candidate left by far when you look at his cumulative story as a whole. No negativity overthetop positivity lots of character complexity. But his last two weeks have been completely invisible and its messing with my mind.,Edgic,da4nx22,2,t5_3808p
9755549,0,t1_daf7ydp,In my opinion its  David  Hannah everyone else eliminated.Ken is portrayed as a loyal follower. Jay is always being contradicted by the edit and was irrelevant in the last couple votes. Adam makes a ton of mistakes and gets negative comments from others. Will Bret and Sunday were too invisible early on.,Edgic,dafl8u1,3,t5_3808p
9790606,0,t3_5ffvb8,Three things Im very surprised at Hannah and Kens continued support through these last episodes David and Zeke were very close again in Episode  David has a lead in Episode  Adam is pulling back up but will not be enoughSome Questions Is the heightened amount of players hurting our predictive chances? Will we have a final pick for the finale? Do you think the winner be from Davids or Zekes side?,Edgic,dajwlj8,8,t5_3808p
