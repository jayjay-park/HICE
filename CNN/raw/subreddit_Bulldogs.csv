75678,0,t3_1uxhym,does he do it in front of you or is it always in another room? with mine he was always going and doing it in the kitchen where we did not see from the living room. we put up a gate so he simply could not go into the kitchen unless we were in there to supervise. we kept this up for a few months and then we took the gate out of the equation and he kept with the good behavior. if there is no way to do a gate ive also heard of leashing and bringing him with you all the time around hte house or tethering him obviously with a lot of slack. basically so he cant get to the special spot he associated with the behavior. hope this helps!,Bulldogs,cen1m95,2,t5_2sseo

301387,0,t1_cfax52x,Sorry I was quite busy with my poor little guy over the weekend to also thank you for your response as well.  Turns out that canned pumpkin isnt as easy to find in February as it would probably be in November as both grocery stores I went to had nothing but the good news is that two days off the Flagyl and Elwood is slowly returning back to normal.  Yesterday he didnt seem interested in water at all so we syringed him some Pedalite to keep him from dehydrating since he did keep peeing albeit more on his usual schedule.  Were going to start weaning him back to his normal food from the Hills ID stuff that the vet gave us as his poops seem to also be getting back to normal so panicked dad can start to relax which of course helps him stay relaxed too.  ,Bulldogs,cfc06hh,1,t5_2sseo
