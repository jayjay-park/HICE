9003658,0,t3_53itgj,Ive downloaded the documents attached at the bottom of the article as a PDF. Im going to refer to these documents by the page numbers of the PDF.Pages  and  are clearly about West and they clearly connect him to MKULTRA but unless Ive missed something somewhere Subproject  is not mentioned once.Pages  are about Subproject . Again unless Ive missed something West is not mentioned once. The names of the doctor and university have been redacted. You can make some variant of Wests name fit the blanks but that doesnt prove its him. With as many variants of his name as you can think of you can jam him into a blank of almost any sizeLouis Jolyon WestL. Jolyon WestLouis J. WestJolyon WestLouis WestL.J. WestL. WestL WestWestAnd thats not even tacking M.D. on the end.Basically what Im seeing is two sets of documents with no obvious connection except that theyve been included together in the same packet. How do we know theyre connected? Can someone help me out with this?Also does anyone know the origin of page ? Pages  are Mori ID  but page  is not included with them.Edit Wikipedia confirms Wests involvement with Subproject  with a reliable source but Im still not seeing a connection between Subproject  and Ruby. And Id still like to know the origin of page  if anyone knows it.Edit  I found Page  in the MKULTRA Briefing Book which has lots of information on most of the MKULTRA subprojects.,MKUltra,d7u3lry,1,t5_2uvaz
