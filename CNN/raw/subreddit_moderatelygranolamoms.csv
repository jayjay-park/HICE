6181036,0,t3_402ebb,  Hmm. Food is probably the biggest thing for me. We arent super big into organic but we hunt for our protein and so far have never taken a trophy animal except maybe that  lb King Salmon. When we dont get enough meat out in the bush we buy from a grassfed beef farmer up the hill. We do all our summer veggies through a farmshare and our own garden and keep root veggies overwinter in the cellar. I ferment my homegrown cabbage into kraut we compost and have a little wormfarm and pick a lot of berries. We incorporate wild edibles sometimes. But we buy our fruit seasonings tomato products and wheat products at costco. Baby boy has a thing for bananas .   Im also big into babywearing we use a diy linen woven mostly but sometimes we go for the ergo. Im dying to get a lillebaby or an onya but I cant convince myself I really need one.  Im kind of tepid on the CD sadly. We EBF for  months until my milk dried up due to pregnancy. Um.. we use essential oils along with modern medicine? I like the barefoot movement and try not to wear heeled shoes ever. I prefer long skirts to pants and I brush my teeth with bentonite clay.  We love our science and my DH has a desk job and we are all caught up on shots. We dont balk at drinking city water we mostly use pasteurized dairy.  We have  cars. We dont really count as crunchy compared to my neighbor who goes out to milk cows at f. I dream of running a small dairy amp vegetable operation someday but for now we just do what we can .,moderatelygranolamoms,cys7wr4,2,t5_3b6af

6258661,0,t3_40ni1x,I live in a relatively small apartment and have no space for dumb shit so I am ruthless about getting rid of stuff that doesnt work for our lifestyle or for what I think is best for my kid. Mostly here I am talking about VTech toys which my inlaws are apparently huge fans of and which I absolutely hate WHY WHY WHY do they keep talking once your kid is done playing with them?. Usually I will set it up and let my kid have fun with it for a while but then once the novelty wears off I will donate it or pass it on to a coworker with a similarlyaged kid I always ask first in a really lowpressure setting I swear  basically I say that I am clearing out some space and do they want first pick of any of this stuff before I take it to a charity etc. Some of the stuff that he seems to legitimately enjoy playing with I will keep in a bin in the closet. I bring it out when I REALLY FUCKING NEED him to just not bother me for a bit. Like if I am sick or if its been a tough day and I really just need  minutes to prep dinner etc. Sort of like sitting the kid down in front of the TV except with VTech toys instead. In that situation its always SO EXCITING to him because its these toys he vaguely remembers but rarely sees and he presses buttons and the lights flash and hes mesmerized and we all stay sane for a bit. So they have their use.I have an Amazon wishlist for the baby and I try to suggest it to people as often as I can without being rude. I sound like an asshole when I say this but the worst is when they substitute an electronic or obviously incorrect version for something on the wishlist  like I put a ukelele on there they buy him a fake plastic electronic guitar where you push the buttons to pretend you are plucking the strings. etc. Or like I had listed a little play barn and specifically said in the comments that ANY KIND OF TOY BARN at any price would be appreciated so long as it had little stall doors that open and close since thats my babys favorite thing ever. Inlaws bought me basically like a bucket of farm animals that came in a bin that was painted to look like a barn on the outside. And were like I know he wanted a barn! Like well uh he still does because this is just...a box with some barnesque artwork on the outside. But now if I buy him one you will notice that he has a different barn than the one you gave and it will feel like I snubbed you and its just ughhhh gives me such anxiety.Basically I say thank you for anything anyone gives to my son and I give him the toy to play with and make sure to take a lot of pictures. Then I absolve myself of any guilt that I feel in getting rid of it if necessary. I tell myself that they did not spend all that money to make me miserable  they spent it to make us happy  and so if what makes us all happiest is to pass it on then it is the most respectful and appropriate thing I can do with their kind gesture.,moderatelygranolamoms,cz11hq1,2,t5_3b6af

I have a friend who has family in Vermont and she makes an annual pilgrimage to get a van full of fresh amazing syrup. She even gets glass containers for a few extra bucks! I always get  gallons and that lasts me a year rationed carefully. Ill prob get  this year.Its better than the fanciest one Ive tried at whole foods and I would drink it straight I have made it into soda with sparkling water. Its great in everything from coffee to desserts. Maple butter is super easy to make on the stove and is like eating maple clouds.  Its divine in granola. On ice cream.

6460089,0,t3_443u2u,Hubs and my  boys are not circd. Its been great. No problems. In fact its easier imo because the foreskin is fused at first so wiping the willy is like wiping a finger. The only challenge is making sure your pediatrician isnt a complete dumbass and wont yank it back and hurt the kid. Some dont know how to handle intact boys.By the time kiddo can start pulling foreskin back its easy to just have a conversation and tell them how to clean it. A good doctor can even do it for you if you prefer explain it I mean. At that age we expect kids to wash their asses and their hair and their ears not to mention we expect girls to manage to wash their genitals too! so adding foreskin to that list isnt unreasonable. I have in the past been with many circd men...and many of them had issues because of it. Dulled sensitivity scarring pain. Some didnt mind that it was done by the same token its harder to miss what you never knew but some did  a fact Im sure they didnt share with their parents but they felt that way all the same. Circumcision is against my ethics. Its not necessary and any benefits are arguable at best while not circumcising allows for bodily autonomy. You can always choose to get it done but you cant undo it. And it comes with a long list of risks even a possibility of death should something go wrong. That to me is too big of a risk over something not needed. ,moderatelygranolamoms,cznilij,9,t5_3b6af

6897941,0,t3_4a61v9,I truly believe the whole put your baby down drowsy but awake is BS. Some babies are good sleepers and some arent. My advice would be to just do whatever is easiest right now and when if? you want to sleep train cross that bridge when you get there.We sleep trained around  months and it was because night feedings were getting out of hand. My daughter was eating over half of her daily calories overnight. We formula feed. I started feeding her oz before bed and then following up with a oz dream feed an hour later with a fast flow nipple that she sometimes eats all of and sometimes eats none of. The first fourish nights she woke up the same number of times and cried herself to sleep maybe min of crying and then fussing afterwards. If she had cried longer we probably would have comforted her but it didnt come to that. After that she fussed a bit every night but nothing major. Now she sleeps through the night unless she gets her feet stuck in the crib slats. Occasionally she will wake and need to be cuddled but rarely will she need to eat. Its been a game changer. With whatever you decide good luck! ,moderatelygranolamoms,d0y77k9,4,t5_3b6af

We have one small toy box and shelves for books and games. Once those are full if we acquire anything else we do get rid ofstore toys that arent played with much anymore.

9201083,0,t3_569mdu,I went through this with my now . yo and I can say with a high degree of certainty that the accidents are probably a response to something else going on in your daughters life. When mine started school they ramped up. Once we got her back on track her baby brother was born they came right back. Grandma comes for a visit? More poopy pants. Move to another state? Boom again.We were most successful with putting her potty out in the open where it was easily accessible in our case sadly for awhile it was in front of the TV after her brother was born. He spent  weeks in the NICU so that was a complicated time and her grandma was giving her full attention at home and making her sit every hour or so. We slowly moved the potty toward the bathroom where it eventually stayed but the accidents came back after we moved to a different state. Once we were settled there we bought a toilet seat with like a miniflipdown potty seat for smaller butts and shes been doing a lot better on the big potty since then. Sometimes she pees her pants if shes having too much fun outside or something but in general shes doing really well now.Honestly I think she just needed to mature a little bit. We started potty training her at around  and she did REALLY well but then it took about a year for her to be accidentfree like more than  of the time. Now shell be  in April and shes accidentfree about  of the time and its only usually a pee accident.,moderatelygranolamoms,d8iazo8,2,t5_3b6af
