6109247,0,t3_3z3q0i,I went through the same situation. So just tell people you are looking for strictly friends that way nothing is expected and let things happen naturally from there. If sex does come up always play safe and try not to put out too soon. I waited almost  months before having sex with my current boyfriend it goes to show what hes really interested in you or just sex. Of course I pleased him in other ways but I made him to work for it. Before I met him instead of dating I told people I was just looking for friends. To keep me satisfied for the time being I found a couple with similar interests looking for a third and we agreed not to sleep with other people. If we did sleep with other people we would at least tell each other so we knew the risks when we did have sex and the sex would only continue until I found someone to date. We remained good friends but that all that it is now that Im dating.  sorry this was so long Im stoned....,grindr,cyk24rm,2,t5_2tj2f
