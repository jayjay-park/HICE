27272,0,t1_cef6yxr,This is a good idea so you have the wide range of shots. Another thing to do when hitting out of system sets transition sets is just waiting on the ball. When you are hitting that quick tempo set you are adding a lot of energy to your hit. This is just because you are moving so quickly to go get the ball. Now when you are hitting these transition balls you are slowing down your approach in effect taking a lot of energy at your swing. So wait on these sets and see exactly where it is going so you dont need last minute adjustments in your approach. Then use all your bodies energy to go get the ball. Hopefully this helps. ,volleyball,cehjcp8,1,t5_2rcxy

Id say  of the  are probably the top players that show. It was nice because we were actually getting some good volleys with people playing their hardest. I should have made it clear before but we are playing on womens nets. Im not sure if that makes a difference or not. I was really concentrating on form and control tonight and had several good hits but I also had one really good setter and the other  knew to set off the net for the shorties. I noticed my biggest problem tonight was timing. I think a lot of that has to do with not knowing exactly what kind of set to expect. I noticed a lot of times I was waiting at the end of my approach for the ball to come down. Or I was   steps in and realized I overstepped the set. oh my back!

As you play at higher levels youll find athletes training to hit the perimeters of the block and even aim out to tool and score. At the highest levels athletes can train to hit a controlled ball into the block to have another opportunity to score with a better approach or set.,volleyball,cgrxfd8,1,t5_2rcxy

2636168,0,t3_2q3523,gtHow do you pronounce libero?LEEbuhroh not leeBEARoh is the correct pronunciation at least told to me by one native Italian speaker.  Who knows.  gtDo you have any tips for aspiring liberos?Here are my current ideas about liberoI think there are two very different parts of being successful as a libero for two very different parts of the game serve receive and digging.  For servereceive you have to constantly move you body on the court even if its a mm until the last possible moment before setting down your feet in a dynamic position that still gives you the ability to move in different directions if the ball takes a lastsecond flight change as a good float server might deliberately do for example.  You also have to be aware of what trajectory the ball is taking and whether you have to get your initial contact more under the ball especially but not exclusively for serves with topspin or behind the ball especially for flatter serves.  Ignoring sidetoside movement of the ball just considering ball movement in the vertical dimension shank passes happen often because receivers misjudge which of these they need to do and skilled servers will serve in a way that is between the two or transitions between the two in its flight path near where the receiver receives.  I think thats a little bit of sort of unconventional advice some coaches try to get their players to get in a set position and then remain motionless far too soon in the serve flight path letting the ball come to them because a lot of classical passing ideas come from when the game was slower when the ball moved slower and you always had time to move to the correct position and set up a split stance.  I no longer think thats the case and thus not the way the game should be played.  In fact Im not really a fan of the split stance receiving position at all but thats another conversation.  For digging balls I think more than almost any other position besides middle blocker trying to read where the opposite teams sets are going being able to predict and extrapolate where the ball is going is crucial.  You can begin to read hitters by looking at the set how high it is and where the hitter might be able to contact it at its highest due to where they are and how their approach to the spike is going to estimate the steepest angle they can hit downwards without hitting the tape of the net.  You can also eliminate the areas of the court covered by your blockers because the spiker usually cant hit it directly through the hands of your blockers.  If they try for something off the hands the intention is completely different and how the ball moves is going to be completely different and you have to wait and react appropriately.  Theres a lot of underappreciated complexity there I think because the ball can act very differently simply drop to the ground ricochet upwards deflect with sidespin etc. but with enough observation and practice liberos can predict and pass those outcomes with much more consistency.Also something to consider about the mechanics of digging is that you can travel faster upwards than downwards.  The fastest you can possibly accelerate towards the ground is the acceleration of gravity.  The fastest you can possibly accelerate upwards is faster than that if you can jump any height at all.  I think more and more were going to see liberos starting their movement after a ball really low to the ground even lower than they currently do and only either  moving parallel to the ground in the left right or forward directions or  moving upwards but never in a way that requires moving downwards after the ball is hit because its theoretically always going to be a slower maximum acceleration.  Anyway Im going off on a tangent.  For digging balls the nonbeginner libero more than almost any other position should be spending some time off court thinking about exactly what happens when the ball is hit different ways where it goes how you can eliminate certain areas of the court from having to be covered for receiving a direct spike because of the blockers or the hitters approach.  Also related to digging because digging is usually much more physical than serve receive I think the most underdeveloped physical skill at all levels of libero even some pretty high level ones is accelerating really fast in different directions from a stationary position.  I think theres actually a lot of crossover between of all things Track and Field block starts and this motion in many cases and more liberos could learn how to begin moving quickly at an instants notice by learning how to accelerate out of blocks first before we did volleyballdeveloped speed drills in the volleyball gym.  I think theres a lot of crossover there that should be happening.  ,volleyball,cn2oi1t,15,t5_2rcxy

2833496,0,t3_2r5tj6,I have played a number of s tournaments. When receiving serve you have  serve receivers and  setter up at the net. The right side generally hits from the right side but can hit out of the middle if they feel more comfortable.In my opinion the game is won by defenseblocking.  The key to setting up an effective defense in s starts with the block.  When I play we have two blockers up at the net one on each side.  Behind their back each blocker will show  or  fingers. This indicates where the block will be set up.  finger indicates that they will block a line hit while two fingers indicates that they will block cross.  The server then communicates before the serve Same or Different so each blocker knows what the other is doing.  By setting up the block this way the defense can then be set.  If the blocker is blocking line you know not to set up on the line so you can come in the court off of the blockers shoulder and if they are blocking cross you can set up close to the line.Being able to transition effectively also contributes to success on the court.  If you find a solid team of three your team will continue to get better the more you play together.I hope this helps a bit!,volleyball,cnq5wyg,1,t5_2rcxy

The set is poor.  So you peel line per your call.  The opponents hitter drives a hard top spin ball to the seam and about  feet deep.Your partner had angle and you have peeled line.  Your partner will be set deeper than you because you peeled.  The ball is hit to seam so you both move to the ball.  You both could dig it.  Your partner being sort of behind you.I say it is the deeper players ball since he can hit the ball forwards to the short defender.

This website also has a few different variations of the rules for indoor and beach between FIVB and the USA LinkChange from sideout scoring to rallypointRally point system replaced side out scoring as of January st  for all FIVB competitions including World League and the Grand Prix. National Federations had until January st  to introduce the rule before it became compulsory for everyone. The main reasons it was introduced was that it was perceived that it will shorten long matches and add excitement it would maintains the basic structure of the game provides chances for catchup and is easy to understand and applicable to all ages and categories. sourceServe from anywhere along the base line volleyballThis was introduced in  but from what Ive just read there were still limitations to how far back a player could go if im reading it correctly. This would indicate that Jump Serves would not be allowed!? if someone else could read in and see what they think? sourceletserve still in playYear Introduction of the libero volleyballThe Libero was introduced in . The idea behind it was to add a specialist back line player to pass the ball and potentially make rallies go for longer. sourceI cant find any information about a net height change that was sanctioned by FIVB.

4656643,0,t3_3cp807,Reaction time isnt as important as reading the hitter. Watching where the set goes can help you to predict where the hitter will hit it. Watching where he squares his body will help. You should work on your speed too not so much for sprinting to the spot as much as you should be exploding from one place to another. Trust your blockers. Theyre there to give you a hint as to where the ball will go. They should limit him to one side of the court so the hitter wont hit it straight into their hands. You should also know the correct spot you should be going to once the ball is set to a specific person. For example if youre on the outside and the other team sets it to the outside you should be taking steps to the right while the ball is set so that your back is square up with the back corner. If youre on the outside and the ball is set to the right side you should take one step back so that your left foot is on the line. ,volleyball,cthj15v,1,t5_2rcxy

4814963,0,t3_3greux,Depending on the level of play and how advanced your running your setter both logics are correct. Youngerfundamentally focused Less advanced setters really need to rely upon a strong center of gravity getting to passers target spot fast planting feet square to target hitter use leg strength to power your set. Arm shoulder hand strength have little impact on ability to set across court. Oldernext level setting schemes when you start incorporating sets to every hitting spot imaginable from every setter position possible arm shoulder and hand strength have a significant impact. All the steps I mention above are important but if you consider attempting to set a Shoot from a high jump set with your arms fully extended... Get your kids to learn how to set legal in beach vball. Lets them slow down the set but the strictness of double contact will have them focused on getting that center of gravity positioned early and use the whole body legs and core to set the ball. ,volleyball,cu1grtw,1,t5_2rcxy

Two players on the court coachplayerdrill runner stands in the corner of the court and has the basket of balls. the coach throws hits lobs balls at these players. and the  players must each touch the ball once to make two total touches hence the name.As the ball tosser you can hit the balls at the players toss them so they have to dive forward to them or sprint backward for them and have them try play them in a way that the other person can get a touch on it. Its a pretty intense drill and it emphasizes people exerting themselves as much as they can.Rules Ill often play withIf the ball hits inside of the court without anyone touching it then both players either have to do a dive where they are or run to and touch the nearest wall and get back in place. If one person touches it then no points and if they both touch it they get a point usually to .Ill expect to hit  balls at each pair of players so i dont make it easy by any standards. I keep the balls coming in quick succession even if the players are off the court from a ball they just chased down ill throw one that will encourage them to come back quickly.Bit of running bit of helping them get used to keeping the ball near the court in cases of hard passes. Usually builds trust in teammates. It can be a bit over the top though depending on the skill level of players. ,volleyball,cuvooif,2,t5_2rcxy

If you have access to a net service reception is also extremely important and have home practice setting into a tape circle on the court. A good setting drill is for him to start on the net you to throw a ball to around the  metre lines or further away from the net and for him to set it to a marker after a bounce.Basically though the important thing to remember here is that hes only  teams are pretty unimportant at this stage and its all about getting him very good at the basics.Source play mens premier league youth state team Australian youth team mens Australian volleyball league am ,volleyball,cv5of7r,2,t5_2rcxy
5146826,0,t3_3lgq85,I have been playing for some time now throughout high school and college.  As a guy I have always loved the Molten Pro Touch.  This was the official mens ball for college for years.  Most girls I have played with at every level complain that the pro touch is too hard and dont like it.  The official girls ball was the Molten Super Touch which for me is OK if it is properly inflated but just doesnt have the same pop as the pro touch.Recently I purchased the new Molten Flistatec and have been loving it.  The feel is a little different than a pro touch and some of the older players dont like it as much but to me it still has that nice pop that a pro touch has.  I know for some colleges it has become their official ball and I think for some it might even be the official ball for the girls team as well though Im not  sure on that.The other ball you might consider is the Mikasa indoor ball.  The blue and yellow one on the top banner.  A friend of mine has one and really likes it.  To me it feels larger and heavier than the Moltens.  I think at the international level they play mostly with this one.  If you can definitely give it a fell to see what you think.As far as outdoor goes you can never go wrong with the Wilson AVP ball.  It is the yellow and white one you see everywhere beachoutdoor is played.  It feels nice and has a good weight for outdoor play.  Recently I got a chance to play with Asics outdoor volleyball and actually really liked it.I did play with some Tachikara balls in high school.  We had  different ones we used.  One had a softer squishy outside while the other we referred to as the hard touch ball.  The hard touch was the most similar to the pro touch so we would always fight for it during practice while the softer ball was similar to the super touch if I recall correctly.  Having not played with them in about  years I cant make a good comparison.Here are some links to the balls I mentioned as it can be easy to mistake some of the cheaper versions as just great deals.Molten Pro TouchMolten Super TouchMolten FlistatecMikasa IndoorWilson Outdoor AVPI think this is the right one but it does seem cheap and I know there are  different kindsI cant find the Asics ball.I know volleyballs can be expensive but if you can get a ball for indoor and a ball for outdoor.

Remember this is a short net so the women can block just fine.If you do not want to run three blockers then run  and have the weakest blocker or the setter play behind for dumps and the other two read.  Again the off blocker needs to drop on that angle.I prefer the first method because this gives you the best chance of having a double block.You also might be able to bring a guy up to block if you have  females in the front row.  This guy would be a grounded hitter and he must hit the ball with no downward trajectory.

Notice in the picture how the height of the ball is some what higher than where your traditional forearm platform would be. When the ball is coming extremely fast and you dont have time to adjust your body positioning you have to dig with your hands instead.

8137755,0,t3_4qepkd,A lot of people added some great things for you. Just to touch on the mentality of this you should be focusing on providing a numbers advantage. Your job is to add an extra person to every block and to pull a person from the block. Someone mentioned being a middle is about being quick but its also about being on time. A real struggle for middles is closing the block on tempo sets to the pins. In order to do this you must be quick but you must also use your reads and fundamentals to get you there. Your coach could have a different philosophy but Ive been told its better to jump straight up and leave a hole for a defender to fill than to float away. Another part that is crucial to being a mid is to expect not to block the ball. Keep in mind that the hitter is trying to hit the ball down so unless youve guaranteed to put the ball down it is better to force it to one of your passers. As a defender and coach Id much rather see my blocks put up an aggressive solid block with more room to hit around than a loose wild one with lots of holes to bounceforce a ball through. On the hitting aspect I lose my mind over not using middle hitters enough so Im usually disappointed in other teams use of middles. Being prepared and always ready for balls is huge. My teams have always been middle heavy teams because it allows the other players better hits once its established. We love the  to set the tone in our matches. As far as finding your hits it usually seems to all come together once you find your attack point for your approach. I see lots of middles struggle transition back to the ten foot to a similar spot and address their approach. If you arent getting to a similar depth or similar spot on the court there is no way to consistently jump aggressively towards the set. If you cant be on time for the ball the setter cant use you. A drill someone mentioned earlier is to jump at the net transition back and then attack a one ball. While this works its usually hard to relate to game speed since most free balls dont even come at that slow of a speed. We do this on down balls to the libero but we also run this against a block. The block is always pre planned giving you a middle hole solo full double or empty net. There are specific answers to each block. The key to this not only be able to get to the one ball but also to know what to do once youre there. I believe volleyball is just muscle memory and reps to learn the sport. Nothing better than getting touches.,volleyball,d4urjhn,1,t5_2rcxy

The other part that I focused on a lot was hand contact which you can practice against the wall or honestly just hitting the ball into the ground in front of you but making sure to get topspin before it hits the floor.  I never had much trouble with the footwork to be honest  maybe because I would switch my feet when I would practice my left hand from the ground Doing other lefthand stuff can help too  I actually picked this up from a drum teacher to help even out my rolls but things like using your fork with your left brushing your teeth with your left using a computer mouse  it helps your brain get more familiar with fine motor control on the left ,volleyball,d4yz9du,1,t5_2rcxy

Would you give a spot for all  teams that win it between now and the next Olympics? gt and additional European teams would have made it to the Olympics and it would be more representative of the world rankings.Thats not really the goal of the Olympics. They want the whole world represented. This is why there are qualifiers for each continent.gt Instead we get more Asian and African teams who are not among the worlds best Iran is pretty good though.What do you mean more Asian and African teams? There is only one of each this Olympics.The problem with Olympic qualifying right now is this stupid nd World Qualifier a tournament of such low quality that Mexico won it.

Hes arguably the best opposite in the world who was switched to outside in the  Olympic Finals and passed well enough to win a gold medal.  His hitting percentages with Zenit have been off the charts too.Max Holt just hasnt had the career success that Mikhaylov has had yet.

8537079,0,t3_4woehh,Coming off a right handed hitter on the outside they have both a solid cross court shot and a sharp line. You can watch the turn of their hand and shoulders to read the hit i.e. the hitter is approaching and facing the cross court its highly unlikely they will make the sharp line. Inexperienced outside hitters will mostly rely on the cross court or the dump in the middle. With your middle hitters its all about how the palm of the hand is facing so try to look past your blockers and read the hitters hands. You can also read the middle hitters pattern they usually have a favorite consistent spot. Same as with the outside hitter look for consistent trash thats going to drop around the ten foot line. Finally with a right side hitter if the right side is right handed they pretty much only have the cross court shot. If the right side is left handed they have both a cross court and a line shot and like the outside hitter you can read it off the shoulders and hand placement. It takes practice and watching the habits of the hitters that you play and working on your speed and versatility.

8548877,0,t3_4wub8n,The opposite is a key player for many teams as heshe is freed of other tasks and therefore the goto hitter for the tight situations and big points. You cannot make an opposites life difficult by serving long or short like you can with an outside hitter. Their job is to put the ball down and thats it.Statistically the opposite is often the top scorer in a game because he is always on the attack back row or front row doesnt get substituted often and often their athletic abilities are the best on the team and not necessarily their volleyball technique dont hate me for that comment I was an opposite myself.Further examples Grozer for Germany. Highjumping hard hitting no compromise player. Known for breaking the fingers of this teammates in practice. Taped his hitting hand completely because he claimed that otherwise the skin on his fingers would go bust. Nikolov for Bulgaria the only guy that hits harder than Grozer IMO Musersky when he played opposite for Russia in the  Olympic Finals and scored  points normally hes a middle blocker. He almost won that game by himself at least sets .So shutting down the other teams best player is a good idea basically if a little simple as an approach to everything My coach used to say Find out what their favorite play is and ruin it for them.You will not be able to stop a worldclass hitter completely. Even against a triple block and coming from the back row the guy or girl will still make most of their points. But you can chip away at their confidence  maybe see below.The downside to this strategy is that if the other team notices youre focusing on one person they will react and you will lose unless you switch as well. The other problem is that if you try and fail you will boost the players confidence to a point where he or she goes into unstoppable mode and simply kills every ball. The mindset of many opposites Ive met is that they thrive on knowing the opponent is focusing on them and still making their points. They love it.For worldclass volleyball life is not that simple. In modern volleyball especially on block and defense its all about scouting and gathering lots of data on the opposing team. The scouts will know which plays the other teams setter likes to play more in a certain rotation and since the blockers are unable to stop every attack they will focus on the most likely one. After all you dont need to stop every attack just a few to win the game. One or two blocks wins the set if both teams are on point with their passing.,volleyball,d6a6jp8,6,t5_2rcxy

9018096,0,t3_53qyhx,Being right on the setter allows to to hit the ball right out of their hands which leads to a faster hit and gives the other middle less time to react to your hit.

11337184,0,t3_60rn1v,I can relate. I tried practicing against a wall for over an hour a day in December. I tried hitting certain bricks adjusting the distance from the wall slamming the ball against the wall then passing it and moving my feet laterally from side to side over the whole length of the wall. I had to mix it up to not get bored. I felt I developed bad habits because the motion is just different from receiving a serve in game.I stopped doing the wall drills in January and my passes got better again. I think a lot of it is just seeing different people serve the ball to get used to the flight path. Since Iwere so new to the game we havent seen that many different people serve at us. Im ever so slowly getting used to returning float serves but now Im starting to play good jump servers. I just have trouble eyeing the path the ball is going to take as I feel like thats  of it for where Im at right now. Its easier to dig hard spikes just because I can predict the path the ball is going to take.Ive had a couple of good passers tell me I need to relax but Im not sure what technical part of this they mean since the arms are supposed to be locked out. I do notice I do better when my body is more rested. Im not sure if Im shrugging my shoulders more or what. I just feel really stiff if Im playing too much then my passes lose the accuracy or I start shanking passes.If anyone has any other advice to make it more difficult for me to return serves from recreational to beginning players let me know. Ive started trying to stay seated on my butt knees or even lying totally flat in a prone position on my stomach to make myself get up from there after some people serve at a more beginner place that I play to give myself less time depending on the level of the server. I also always go for balls that are out within reason if were up by about  points.,volleyball,dfh1tc5,1,t5_2rcxy
