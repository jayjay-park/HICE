6342377,0,t1_czai9rt,So youre regularly working a  hour day if you include the marking at home and you still have to work at the weekend? Thats quite extreme  and thats coming from an exnanny used to working a  hour week! Its just baffling to me that we treat our teachers to badly. ,TeachingUK,czak3d7,3,t5_2y912

8410807,0,t3_4uq7a5,The trade off seems to be that a schools direct path front loads the pain so you have a pretty intense training year but a much easier NQT year as you have bags more experience and hands on classroom management experience going into NQT vs the PGCE route.I did SD and my timetable actually decreased by my NQT year.I found that getting employment was FAR easier on the SD route due to the additional exposure and being left to drown nature of the SD course. I was much better prepared and confident than the PGCE competition I was up against who had done only a few weeks of teaching with a teacher in the room and often hadnt even done KS.But if youre a maths or science teacher then that might not be an issue due to massive demand.As uwoeuntothee points out much of the decision rests with how the school is. With SD you are at the mercy of your HoD and Mentor. Do the school actually train you or are you just cheap labour? What are the kids like? If its a challenging area then remember that you have a pretty intense year with those kids where you will inevitably make mistakes. If behaviour is a worry then I might pause for thought to be honest that sort of thing can put you off the profession if encountered first up.Being free of debt is a great way to start your career and many of the PGCE route students I know found the pedagogy uninspiring and unrelated to the classroom environment they encountered. But if your school isnt really focused on your needs then SD can be a nightmare. One thing to ask  are any SD or SCITT trainees now working at the schhol?,TeachingUK,d5sw8lh,1,t5_2y912

10802743,0,t1_ddu4yeh,gtHow hard are they to get into I am not the best at interviews not got the best GCSEs and A levels. I dont really know big companies did them.Well the better the scheme the more competitive they are to get into. However getting into teaching is also going to involve interviews and then many of the same skills confidence presentation skills communication in front of a class every day. So I wouldnt advise going down the teaching route just because you dont feel confident with interviews...because youre still going to have to do interviews!  There are some great resources online about helping you prepare for competency based interviews and assessment centres. The more practice you do at these and the better prepared you are the higher your chances of getting onto the scheme you want.gtAny recommendations for high paying apprenticeships that are not that competitive?  I can only speak for my local area but the best higher level apprenticeship schemes that offer the most training development and accreditation for the trainee which then leaves you best qualified to get a job in the relevant industry tend to not be that well paid.This is because the company is already investing a lot of time money and effort into properly training you in ICT  accounting etc and making sure you get your exams as well as practical hands on work experience. They see the higher level apprenticeship scheme as being the gold standard as good as or better than a degree in the subject. When you consider that people are paying k a year in tuition fees for three years to get an IT degree whereas a higher level apprenticeship with a level  qualification and some professional accreditation is free...you can see why the wages tend to be very low. However when you qualify after two years as an apprentice you will have no student debt lots of on the job experience and relevant professional qualifications leaving you well set up to get a higher paying job as you will no longer be at apprentice level. I hope this makes sense! Id advise you to check out the higher  intermediate level Apprenticeships on offer through your local FE college as in my experience anyway this is a good way of making sure you will actually get proper training on the job and have a college to rely on for support throughout the programme if you need it.You havent mentioned where in England you are based but just for example heres a link to the relevant section at Kendal CollegeIm sure your local college will have something similar!,TeachingUK,ddu862o,1,t5_2y912
11097275,0,t1_depui4q,gtI routinely work a  hour week  hours a day? Isnt it a am to  job with an hour lunch maybe an hour of preparation every day and some marking which is simple enough to do while watching TV?gtyou will have to cater to SEN childrenThe primary school I was in hired people to give these children extra help at one point there were  assistants at once. gtexamprogress pressureI thought you said you taught year could you be a bit more pinpoint as in what you mean?gtI have also dealt with some horrifying CP cases since I qualified. I cant turn it off when I get home  it does take over my life.What is CP? I keep getting this when I google it  . ,TeachingUK,depv7au,-6,t5_2y912
11547329,0,t1_dg4rrcc,I was recruited and didnt think it would be this different to be honest. As well there is a huge oversupply of teaching and I didnt feel like subbing for a year.Plus I didnt want to settle in Canada yet and I wanted to see what it was like living in the U.K.,TeachingUK,dg4w4nh,1,t5_2y912
