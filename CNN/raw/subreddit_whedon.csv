Mostly it read like him saying that writing a strong female character means writing a strong character that happens to be female. ,whedon,cf0dtg7,8,t5_2qnnu

660876,0,t1_cgeuf90,Remember Season  Episode  Out of Sight Out of Mind the invisible girl is recruited for training as an assassin by the government at the very end of the episode. I think that its heavily implied that certain government agencies make use of the supernatural or extraordinary but that most of those stories were simply out of scope for Buffy and Angel.,whedon,cgfe3it,1,t5_2qnnu

2255446,0,t3_2l0zla,The Gods represent the horror movie audience.  The Ritual represents the traditional horror movie plot that must occur before the audience dubs the movie a success.  When movies dont follow the ritual they tend to get blasted as bad horror movies and not do well.  Cabin In The Woods subverts this trope by having the kids refuse to comply with the ritual resulting in the audiencegods rising up and destroying the world i.e. the horror movie genre so that we can start fresh with new ideas.  ,whedon,clqhtuy,41,t5_2qnnu

11158197,0,t1_dew5s6i,I think it varies from show to show I find things like the walking dead a week is too long unless there was a major event Ive completely forgotten everything thats happened since its  irrelevant dialogue.Then youve got shows like Castle where most episodes are selfcontained plots and dont have much impact on the next one so theres no need for deep introspection and binge watching them is okay.Actually if anything its not so much the waiting between episodes its the community the dialogue between people as they speculate what is going to happen next and share their favourite moments and characters etc. And the problem with ondemand series is that people are always on different parts of the show you cant share your anticipations and favourites with someone on episode  when you bingewatched to episode  already. This means the only time people get to collectively discuss a series is when theyve finished it. So whereas before people would discuss each episode as it came now people discuss series as a whole and share their anticipations for the next season.,whedon,dewrpws,3,t5_2qnnu
