Lindas Cafe on the West side of town has more traditional dishes and I love her food too. Any of the Thai places in town are amazing but Choo Chai is my favorite because Tahn is the only person that can make it spicy enough for me.

6964131,0,t1_d152fcx,gt You should be ashamed.Rolls eyes. You have absolutely no proof whatsoever of your claims. They are pure and utter conjecture and until you can provide something of substance I will be ashamed of nothing. Again Lubbock is not unique in segregation. It was the standard throughout the south. I did not say it was right I said it was the standard and making ad hominem attacks about what I should feel is fallacious and counterproductive.gt Ongoing discriminationLinking to an article about job callbacks for black sounding names is not proof of anything and especially not proof of anything in Lubbock. Just because one feels that there is ongoing discrimination does not mean that there is. Please cite articles that have proven that Lubbock continues to discriminate.My point is that the first and easiest accusation for just about anything is racism and Lubbock is entirely nonunique in this regard. As a southern town it was segregated just like all other southern towns and I have no argument that the town was laid out according to this segregation however there was nothing notable about its institutional racism and there is little if any evidence of continuing racism or discrimination. Just a feeling is not sufficient to make allegations.Lubbock and indeed most of the US pales in comparison to the world when it comes to racism closet institutional or governmental. I base this on my personal experience of living in South Africa where I was one of the  white minority the government has implemented laws preventing whites from advancing in careers in the private sector and people are killing each other every day because they come from the wrong tribe English Afrikaner Zulu Xhosa Soto etc.Interesting this exact same Reddit not three years ago discussed at length how nonracist Lubbock is.Edit the funniest thing about this is I actually live in East Lubbock county and have for almost  years outside of when I lived in South Africa. I drove down Parkway and Zenith yesterday. I worked in East Lubbock. I shop in East Lubbock. My wife taught at schools including Project Intercept Estacado and Cavazos on the NorthEast Side.
