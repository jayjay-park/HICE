5760574,0,t3_3tzl1k,What people are saying is true practice will get you where you want to be. But if you are truly looking to become the next Ricegnat Tsuaii MoonMun or whatever you must learn the fundamentals. Imagine it like this you see a Tae Kwon Do master in a tournament do an amazing flying double roundhouse kick and think Wow! I want to be able to do that! its improbable to think you can do it efficiently in a sparing session if you dont know how to do a proper kick in the first place. Same thing for drawing. You must learn line shape shading and perspective. To learn these effectively you will need to practice a ton. You cant just jump to what you want to draw because all the little mistakes you will make will misrepresent what your original idea was in  first place. To get at drawing you also need to learn to love the process of it. If you are only working towards an end picture in the beginning you will become disheartened with how bad they can look but if you enjoyed the process it wont matter as much. And youll have more of a reason to draw in the first place. Also drawing just want you want and not the fundamentals requires you to discover how to proportion shading techniques and a ton of other stuff by yourself. If you went to art school they wouldnt tell you to just draw theyd teach you fundamentals and how to do alot of these things. If I made any stupid mistakes in grammar Im apologize its late and Im on my phone with autocorrect. If you want any resources on how to start drawing and stuff feel free to pm me. Ill be happy to help  ,LoLFanArt,cxb5ioe,3,t5_2ty5r
