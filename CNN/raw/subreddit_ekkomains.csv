Its more or less standard for Shaco and deceive has the same base cooldown as phase dive but phase dives cd get lower with levels. So I figure since they have the same kind of mobility and trickery jack in the boxconvergence for surprise cc a ranged slow to help kite stealing that might work.Ive had decent success in normal games.

7979634,0,t1_d4c5b17,Okay so what Im understanding from it is liandrys on Ekko would be much better to purchase late game but its not the best item I can get Deathfire is not good unless you have massive ap so Ill stick with TL for now. I like how you set up and explain exactly what you are thinking when seeing if a build will work for a champion one of my main problems in having in league is itemization. I can pick the best items for a champ but I cant always decide what partsfull items to get first. Im going to be using your method now on deciding what to build not only for Ekko but for all the champs I play. Ive broke it down to What does the champ want me to buildWhat do I want to buildWill it work? If not make changesIve been messing around with the protobelt Ap Ekko already stacks lots of ap and if I cant gt them with a egtq combo they normally have very little left and I just press protobelt and they die.

8559473,0,t3_4wx52a,I go along with the most of your Points and especially the part about the W and passive changes made and still making me mad.I really had no Problem with the first nerfs during the huge Tank Ekko wave especially because it made me impossible to Play him during that time  I just dont want to cry in the CS to dont ban him or to pick him for me... .I always kept in mind as Long as they only hit his damage its okay. But then the W Duration...plus passive cooldown...I main Jungle Ekko and it was devastating during the first games.Clearing the Jungle camps is since then pretty much as mess early and every experienced early game enemy Jungler can take an Advantage with invading you.I hate the fact that I better go base than Clearing the Jungle til very low hp. But even if you go to base very early may someone stole your buff...I prefer to build him heavy AP in the jungle and as Long as I kinda hit it to late game Im very confident since you can go in  assasinate a target  maybe get out. This is also possible on Mid AP Ekko. Sad only that you have to hit that Peak with the core items to be a serious danger.I guess thats why Tank Ekko is still that favored since the risk and the building path are at least solid in comparison to the AP Build.I just cant stand it. I really hope that Riot will understand once that his kit would fit quite well as a jungler since there is no particular way for Lane Ekko as AP Mage  Assassin and that TankBruiser just doesnt fit.Currently I actually see the most Top Ekkos failing thats why I dont see that much of a danger ..

10255064,0,t3_5mujck,I would get corrupting into dark seal for top lane but if you think its an easy matchup go dorans.Also note that with the right runes and masteries you can clear casters with two Qs if u take dorans ring or dark seal.,ekkomains,dc6gucm,2,t5_386w1
10261933,0,t3_5m9vuk,Went through the video frame by frame and everyone seems to be right. The moment after you blinked your Q was sitting right where you standing before the E so it mustve been the most perfect timing of all time.,ekkomains,dc78v5n,1,t5_386w1
10305993,0,t3_5nktjc,Well Make sure to take the right runes and masteries so you can kill caster minions with two Qs. Always try to be pushing into your enemy laner that way if they go for auto harass your minions will target enemy laner. Keep minion advantage. You need to pressure on your level ups as this will either make or break your lane control. The level  power spike being extremely important.,ekkomains,dcc8mvp,2,t5_386w1
10377510,0,t3_5ok76v,There are a ton of alternatives.Lich Bane  considered bad because its power comes from other AP items not alone and is expensive. However Sheen in build path most prefer this alone to make use of Ekkos ad with decent ap items like Blasting Wand in build path. Preference item some make it work but overall not too ideal due to scaling off of APHextech Gunblade  revolver in build path good for sustain in lane personal preference item and again expensive I personally dont like itProtobelt  just explaining why its built revolver in build path cheap offers good stats survivability and utility synergises well with kitMorellonomicon  average build path no powerspike until finished item cheap stat stick item snowballing item that leaves you squishy until you build other items overall not a good pick IMO unless you know you can use it to snowball as it is a snowballing item. I only buy it if I need grievous woundsFrost Queens Claim  specific style of play and built solely to rush your powerspike from an earlier than normal Death Cap see sidebar for SaintKillians guidesbuild etc considered an advanced build for Ekkos who really know their stuffRod of Ages  the traditional first item for Ekko this was what everyone would build on him around release. Still decent would build if in a tough lane such as Yasuo LB etc just know that it is a scaling item and MUST be rushed to be effective. Good stat stick investment for midlate survivability item but delays your powerspikesHextech GLP  similar to Rod of Ages just a preference item except it is NOT a scaling item and offers good stats straight up the active is ok also similar to Gunblade in the sense of providing sustain from catalyst and gives you revolver in build path for a powerspikeLudens Echo  snowballing item similar to Morellonomicon expensive for its stats however I recommend only building this as a first item if you are completely stomping your lane because it gives you great roaming potential and overall snowballing potential. NLR in build path considered by some to be both a bad expensive and good great stat boost powerspikeThats all I can think of atm. Cant say Ive seen any other starting items on Ekko that worked anyway.    ,ekkomains,dckcrt2,3,t5_386w1

10471146,0,t3_5pww8i,If I am going to build a Hextech item I either go protobelt or gunblade the deciding factor is how well I am doing. If I am stomping my lane and rolling on others as well while roaming then Gunblade helps if you think about it in tht situaction a little less AP wont matter youll still get bigger by the time you finish it. If I fall behind or are doing just fine then I go protobelt its cheaper and allows for a faster power spike. I NEVER get cutlass. I dont mind this nerf at all. ,ekkomains,dcv0fyq,1,t5_386w1

Ty for your op.gg I will study it hard and probably I will get back with some questions.,ekkomains,dd83rzi,1,t5_386w1
10589914,0,t3_5rfh3q,Imo I dislike it. Ekkos real damage comes from passive proc not sucessive autoattacks. Not to mention you have a build with  tankyness which reduces the potential of autoattacking specially in teamfights. And I dont see how nashor can help you in tougher matchups more than zhonyas or abyssal would. Final note Lich Bane shouldnt be last item. Really helps out to reach the  cdr better assassination and taking objectives faster.,ekkomains,dd89nuz,1,t5_386w1
10590691,0,t1_dd83rzi,I find at toplane you generally cannot fight most people before you hit your power spike they have gutted his early base damages too much. Your objective is to survive a war of attrition until level  at which point you should be able to push the wave with  Q to kill casters and  autos for the melees. Then you can try and roam or tp. The lane phase isnt the strong point the midgame roamskirmish potential is where ekko really comes into his own.Darius is just impossible to v on Ekko you just have to wait for midgame. Teemo is annoying in lane but again you are much more useful midgame. Riven is actually quite an even matchup you just have to make her use E then go for the trade and you should win it as her early base damage is also quite low. Again play safe in the lane phase just focus on pushing the waves. The strength is in the midgame when you can skirmish ruin carries and siege with dive potential with the threat of a W stun.,ekkomains,dd8cjj2,1,t5_386w1

10649860,0,t3_5sehl9,You didnt mention the ad in gunblade which is great for taking towers and add a lot to your damage in vs. Also the thing with GB and proto is that they allow for Es that wouldnt reach otherwise with their dashslow GB active has the perfect range just outside ekkos E. The GLP active is stronger in tf as you said but its only  sec and the range is not great so its not useful to catch up thats why burst assassin ekko prefers the first two and bruisserish likes GLP.,ekkomains,ddeg8t2,1,t5_386w1
10661549,0,t3_5sjvuz,idk what the CDR build is and when I read your title I thought you were talking about CDR runes lolWhether youre talking about a specific build or runes or whatever there are enough CDR items available to allow you to reach  every game Ionian Boots  Zhonyas  Lich Bane  Morello  Protobelt  FQC  Abyssal  Nashors  Visage andor Iceborn Gauntlet if you want to go tankier  and  respectively Blue Buffs also provide CDR and as the midlaner you should be getting a fair amount of them All these items provide  CDR you should have no trouble hitting the cap by incorporating at least  of these into your build path.Edit Personally I do not run CDR runes as I dont think there is a need to but I do run Intelligence over Precision since Ekko doesnt make good use of the Lethality from Precision,ekkomains,ddfnoom,4,t5_386w1

She can easily escape your W with hers.Id say the best you could do is try to somehow land your stun on her. Other than that use your Q to keep her from farming. If she gets hit Id engage with E and hope that your Passive movement boost is enough to escape before she can trigger the Q.Use your Level  power spike as good as you can past level  youll have a hard time.,ekkomains,dgrmsh7,2,t5_386w1
