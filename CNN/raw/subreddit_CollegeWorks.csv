10359348,0,t3_5ien8n,Where should I start! Walking up to my final interview was the most nerve racking experience. All I thought to myself was dont mess up because I did not want to let this great opportunity to slip away. Once I officially got hired my heart was racing so fast with happiness and excitement. I was ready to get started that day! College Works Painting changed my life in ways I could never even imagine. I ran a business as a college student when pretty much no one else had the opportunity to. Which made me think of myself as a badass in general. Even though I had ups and downs throughout the internship they helped me see the light at the end of the tunnel. It showed me that even if I get knocked down to my knees I am able to get back up and keep going. Some days I think where would my life be if I did not do College Works and I have no clue where! I wouldnt be the person I am today. I am just thankful I went to my final interview with College Works Painting which helped me change my life forever.,CollegeWorks,dciajup,8,t5_3dcmb

10732450,0,t3_5tfcaa,College Works Painting competition is by far the reason why Im so competitive these days. The top  year old college students from across the country go head to head in their own businesses and Its only up to them if they find success. How much more competitive can you get? Ive never been more hungry for success in my life than my intern year. ,CollegeWorks,ddmyzyq,1,t5_3dcmb
10753624,0,t3_5tt29o,My favorite memory College Works Painting has brought me would be starting my business in a completely new market. It was my DM and Is hometown. Had very little support from family and friends but we kicked ass proved everyone wrong and for a nd year in a row we will be painting houses in Corry Pa. Would not have been possible without the support and brilliance of my DM. Not to mention I was able to turn my branch over to my cousin who was my crew chief. ,CollegeWorks,ddp5kmp,6,t5_3dcmb
