4104601,0,t1_cro2yy0,I can only speak for myself but this isnt meant to be a takeover. Of course this sub wont be as popular as the main sub. This is not the plan. I created it for whenif the time comes that people cannot submit posts on the main sub like they used to. If theyre not allowed to post on the other sub they can post here and discuss. If the main sub stays as it is  all the better. This sub here will still be open for people who dont want to deal with the drama over there or just need a change or enjoy both subs. ,SerialAftermath,cro5dul,3,t5_38e5s
