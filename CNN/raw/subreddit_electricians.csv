FAULT is a pair of contacts internal to the soft start and operated by the control logic. Most likely they are kept closed when everythings copacetic and opened when a software or other internal issue is detected the documentation for this unit should clarify this. FR on the other hand is a user supplied relay that is used to dump the main contacts IC or IC depending on selected rotation under a fault condition. The fault conditions are either the thermal OL opening up or the internal FAULT contacts opening up. The only thing thats optional is the indicator W.

532509,0,t1_cg0oyex,This is a guess but assuming theres no manual rope system for hand ringingWhen the bell hangs silent theres a closed switch. When power is applied it runs through that switch to the coil of the motor contactor. The motor runs the bell in one direction to a point where the switch cuts the power to the motor contactor. The bell swings down by gravity. This should close the switch again but theres a mechanism which prevents this when the bell moves in that direction. The bell swings all the way in the other direction striking. As it swings back at some point power is once again applied to the motor because the switch can close in that direction.The cycle repeats. This happens for all bells except the one with the solenoid.Alternatively the system may rely on separate timers for each but I suspect not. Very difficult to rely on and keep set. The Angelus and funeral toller do rely on motor driven timers and the Angelus wiring is tricky ?!?.Id probably need to go to the makers seminar or study the manual for a few hours to figure this all out. Still its the sort of stuff I used to do though I never worked on a bell system.Im not sure what your guy was adjustingfixing. Usually a motor contactor works or doesnt  no fixes needed. I suspect the key is in the switch that controls the power to each bell. If the contactor is bad replacing it with anything that works should be fine  its more a matter of physically fitting something.These days wed often look at using SSRs instead.

Sensor technologies are the same most commercial ones use relays you would need to make sure the relays are compatible with LED.

958320,0,t1_chd5buk,gtAnd things work without grounds but what is the reason for having it for exmaple on an outlet?Grounding is a safety device. It ensures that anything that is grounded will be at the same potential to ground. In practice this means that if you had a broken piece of equipment where a part of it was energized but it didnt have a path to ground it would sit happily at V. When someone touched it they would be the path to ground and V would flow through them. You have a ground in outlets so that it can be supplied to devices that are plugged in. Grounding a metal junction box offers the same protection to the electrician. If the hot wire is damaged and shorts to the box it will trip the breaker rather than shock the electrician.gtWhy was i able to make an outlet work by placing the bare ground on the neutral when the neutral had broken off at the counduit?Youre assumption was correct. Because they tied back to the same point at the service entrance.gtwhat makes a gfi a gfi? if i dont ground a gfi it would still work but if im not mistaken it wont trip right?A GFI will work just as well with our without a ground. For safety as described above we supply a ground to offer a safe path for electricity in the case of a short on the hot side. The GFI works by sensing a difference in current between the hot and the return. The hot and return can be different because the current is travelling to ground through a ground circuit or because it is passing through a bathtub to the plumbing. ,electricians,chd7x9m,2,t5_2slrm

With solid wire make nice tight grouping and bending no matter where they start they all run together and land them on the ground bar.Third thing Neutrals I like to tape them to the hot they serve at the entry point of the panel after that group all the neutrals together and land them on their neutral bar.At this point I would like to mention that the ground and nutral are only bonded together at the begining of the service  after that they should NEVER cross touch wirenut bolt together or even be considered the same thing ever.

Since you cant guarantee which phase will short out youd you need a grounding path that could potentially lead back to either phase while also remaining disconnected from both phases until a charge on the case is detected to avoid shocking the guitarist all the time.Sounds like a special kind of gfci  one that probably comes with his specific equipment.

Regardless it isnt really used anymore and hasnt for some time so there is a good chance it will develop problems sooner than later.All that said I had great flow to all my fixtures and the pipes looked like they were in good shape.

I hope you know if that needs a GFCI outlet or not.What is the switch supposed to do? It could be a couple of things.The switch is the  wire and the  wire is the outlet. You may have it backwards. The  wire white to silver screw on outlet black to gold. Assuming they used some type of standard with colors on the three way The switch white and red go to gold screw and black to black. OR you need to also feed the  way with the  wire. Depends on how the other end of the  way is wired. There is not enough information in your post.ORMaybe whites together and pig tailed to the outlet. The black on the  wire pig tailed to the switch and the outlet. Red to the switch. If this is the case you have the wrong switch.Oh and turn off the fucking power.Edit You could avoid the whole thing and just call someone out.

You develop a deeper understanding given time. One day itll just go CLICK in your head and youll understand electricity. My boss called it the light coming on.A good control sparky is more defined by his ability to find the answers he needs than by all the things he has memorised.Ladder logic is alot like the way a circuit diagram works theres a slightly newer system called a function block environment but alot of places stick with ladder. Theres basically one main thing about ANY controller. DDC calls it a point PLC guys often call them tags. They are a general term for either  An inpout like a signal in from a switch An output like a connection from the PLC to a motor or a light or anything really Or a virtualdigitalpseudosoftware point everyone calls them by a different name. This is just a software thing inside the PLC that you use when writing programmes dont worry about that just yet. And finally a point is either digital or binary  onoff or analogue like say the input from a temperature sensor giving a reading of between  to  degrees etc.There are other more complicated types but dont worry about that. Focus on getting your head around simple concepts like traditional control gear ie relays contactors etc. Youll spend plenty of time working with that too and when youre good with that it makes understanding any automation alot easier..

Be prepared to spend several hundred dollars in the first few years on aquiring the tools that you will want everyday. Check your locals tool list for required tools.. Depends on local or your program as well. I went x a week for  months for  years..Ive worked with several women thoughout my career as a JW. .Keep at it. Work can be stressful physically demanding extremely long hours especially in a shut down. Ive seen  hour weeks before. Some jobs require a  work schedule if not more. But the payoff in the end is worth it. At the end of the day i can see what Ive done with my  hands and have a sense of pride.. Being soft spoken is fine. But dont hesitate to speak up with questions on why or how something is done a particular way. . Eat healthy dont forget to go to the gym. Even though our job can be demanding physically it is still important to stay in shape. It actually makes the job much easier. Work smarter use the tools available to you to do your job better.

3018453,0,t3_2ur1yi,Good question. It doesnt quite work that way in an AC circuit however. The leftover power leaving the neutral side is not really a remainder.Normally the difference in potential between the hot and neutral conductors is zero.  The component in a GFCI device that monitors current and senses an imbalance or difference between the current flowing out on the hot conductor and the current flowing back to ground on the neutral conductor is referred to as a differential current transformer.  In the event that some of the current returning to ground is passing through you instead of the neutral conductor the transformer will sense the imbalance and open the internal contacts to stop the flow of current through the GFCI device and through you. Edit I find that I learn a lot just trying to figure out how to explain something to someone else. Trying to think of a simpler explanation... Are you familiar with how a current transformer CT works? Just like your clamp meter it reads current flow along a conductor. You normally would clamp one wire at a time to read the current flow in amps. If you clamp both the hot and neutral wires of aV circuit your meter would read zero because the sine wave leaving and returning cancel each other out. Thats what happens in a GFCI. The measurement from hot to neutral is zero unless another foreign path is introduced. ,electricians,coauz8v,2,t5_2slrm

Burned up  hole saws trying to cut the hole so I didnt have the hole through the brick.  Drilled through baseboard flooring wrong spot on walls and ceilings.

If people are seeking a loan the bank will ask for  bids. You dont have to do it but you should. You never know.  If you know its a bank bid then you send in a number that is ridiculous.  If everyone falls out and you get awarded the job. Awesome just made bank and go on vacation.  Its not good practice to charge for an estimate However your time needs to be allocated.

Install twoprong outlets everywhere.  The cheapest way to get you code compliant but annoying to live with.  Which is probably why someone swapped the original receptacles for prong ones. As ucitizenc suggests install GFCIs on each ungrounded circuit.  Depending on the details this rivals or could even be cheaper than option .  One GFCI protects everything downstream from it and you could leave most of the prong outlets in place just adding no equipment ground stickers.  Id recommend exploring this first.. Run new wires.

As long as the wires are the same length material size insulation type and terminated the same way you can change wires in the middle of a run.

See if the outlet is now controlled by the switch or if the light is controlled by the switch.  The opposite one will now be dead.  If not put things back together and take a picture.If one of them is dead and the other is controlled by it then you can proceed.  If the outlet is switched then kill the power put the disconnected wire back on the switch and take the wire that was on the switch and move it to the left side.  If the outlet was off and the light was switched just move the disconnected wire to the other side of the switch.In all cases make sure nothing is making contact with metal or other wires you will be leaving a wire loose that may or may not be energized.

Every day I lift something thats  lbs at least once lift things that are  lbs very routinely and occasional have to lift  lbs.  Im stronger now than i was when i started actually people tend to be overprotective.

With the Netherlands I am not sure but I know that when you move from the USA to Germany you can ha e problems with your surge protectors you might have for your computer as well as some devices that might have some voltage drop against the ground as in Germany most newer buildings have a building wide residual current device that will engage with that.

5049945,0,t3_3k0jec,This depends on a lot of things. First of all many people arent aware that power does not come from nowhere a transformer does not create power out of nothing. In an ac circuit involving inductive reaction Power is the indirect product of current and voltage. This means that if the amount of power in the circuit remains constant and you increase the voltage the amount of current the transformer will be able to supply will decrease. If you double the voltage the amount of current the transformer can supply will be cut in half. If you try to draw the same amount of current as before you will end up with a house fire.Now having said that if your house is connected to a single phase V service you can actually use two hot wires to achieve v if your panel is delta fed and not wye fed. It should be delta. You will need to install a twopole breaker in the panel. This is not something that I would recommend doing on your own you should probably call an electrician. ,electricians,cuupk2k,-2,t5_2slrm

I used to do panel changes for right around  bucks and they were often more difficult than yours looks.This was my thought as well but I wasnt sure.gt Check the outlet in the bathroom it is likely just a loose wire.

5732808,0,t3_3tnfq0,Some of this is really dangerous. If you cut a wire and the lights go out that instant you have broken the return of an energized circuit and one of the two cut ends is now live. You need to shut off that other circuit before you get bit.   The neutral had just looped through the switch box. It is OK to cut that and twist them and another same  gauge solid pigtail together with a wire nut. You then have the pigtail to connect to your fancy switch. I think you can also use a short jumper to connect the two ends you cut as well as the pigtail but the jumper needs to be the same kind of wire as the one you cut. It does matter if you nick the wire and leave a mark or knock off a few strands. It does matter if you use too small of a wire for the current it carries.

Any device calling for over v and more importantly hz instead of our hz will either need a power adapter or complete replacement.

If I remember correctly the reason for the fuse is related to the battery so thats why I left it near the battery   Does my positive wiring look ok? Is it actually feasible to wire three things to the battery positive terminal like I have shown?   Should I put a disconnect switch on the cable going to the inverter?   If I wire the fridge and inverter directly to the positive battery terminal do I also need to wire their negative cables directly to the battery negative terminal? Or is it ok to wire them to a bus bar?

Is there anything particular that I need to look for when I buy the volt meter or is just run of the mill OK?So...if by sub panel you mean it runs through the main house panel it doesnt. I cant remember  but I am pretty sure we ran  separate sets of  gauge wires from the meter to each of the  main parts of the property  set to each set of units  to the pumphouse  to our house...and then from a junction box outside each set of units it was divided to feed a breaker box in each room...and then I am pretty sure that he divided the wire that goes into the house into the breaker for the shop meaning it doesnt run through the main house breaker but is fed by the same line from the meter.I could be wrong about having  full sets of wires as there may be separate feed wires excuse my terminology at the main junction box that is outside the pumphouse all the wires run through here and then head off through conduit in different directions.I could pull the lid to these boxes and check if this is important....and draw a picture if need be.At the time all this was done I was still naively just believing Ruben knew what he was doing haha. Its tough because on one hand these guys know how to build for Mexico and sometimes you have to trust them...but other times you have to say no something seems off and then look it up and override what they want to do.So thats a roundabout way of saying that the pumphouse panel is about  feet from the house but it doesnt run through that main panel. In fact the pumphouse panel was the first one we installed and was actually done by a different guy Euphemio...to add insult to injury we actually went through  plumberelectricians and had to fire the first  haha....officially were on our th now ME!,electricians,d0bbqzv,1,t5_2slrm

Most mushroom pushbuttons are rated for use in control circuits only. For direct power circuit isolation we would use a disconnect switch but these are generally not rated to break the circuit under load. Out of curiosity why cant you use a relaycontactor?Using contacts in parallel works in theory but wouldnt be code compliant not sure if this is a requirement for you.

You may spend  weeks building the raceways and only  days pulling wire.  You may spend a couple weeks doing terminations on the floor of a highrise or hospital.  As far as a typical day goes its the same as many others have said.  Safety paperworkmeeting work until morning break work until lunch work until the end of the day go home.  The major differences Ive seen between the two are below.  Take it with a grain of salt these are only my experiences and observations  Industrial will generally have you at greater heights. Industrial tends to have less digging involved no promises though. Commercial is generally fasterpaced and Id say this is because industrial tends to be more deliberate due to safety considerations.  Not to say industrial is guaranteed to be safer but they seem to make more a big deal about it than on a commercial site.  MMV depending on the site though. Youll tend to have to work more in concert with the other trades on a commercial site but only because youre usually in each others way.  We do work with the other trades in industrial but it seems to be we are less in one anothers way and therefore a little bit cooler with one another.   You will be above the drop ceiling a lot on a commercial job and also see a lot more drywall dust. You will be around many more chemicals and processes that can kill or harm you on an industrial job but you hope that the safety measures they have in place mitigate them.  In all cases falls will be your biggest risk to injury.  Personally Im pretty sure I prefer commercial work but you will learn many different things in each job.  That said if you can work in an industrial setting you can work just about anywhere.  Thats about all I can think of.  Good luck!  ,electricians,d1cf26b,3,t5_2slrm

7527072,0,t3_4ig0z6,Where Im from the power strips have overcurrent protectiontrip switch on the unit somewhere so overloading is not really an issue.  The real danger in my experience has been poor construction of the outlets on the power strips. They can become loose and provide a poor connection leading to heat and possibly even fire. Also they can be covered up under clothing or blankets  reducing heat dissipation and exacerbating the problem.  These are a common cause of house fire especially if they are shit. They arent really meant to be for a long term solution. Youre a bit stuck for options but in the interests of Internet Fastidiousness TMDont cover the power strips with anything that reduces airflow. Dont keep the extension lead coiled up while in use. Keep the extension lead protected for mechanical damage. Play soothing music for the power strips in the late evening. Keep the plugs free of mechanical stress pulling or twisting may loosen already shit contacts. TLDR youre probably OK just check the plugs are coupling OK every now and then and keep everything somewhat ventilated. ,electricians,d2xshga,3,t5_2slrm

There are models that look very similar to frosted incandescent bulbs.As far as making the trick lightbulb yourself it would be pretty simple  LEDs battery maybe some resistors and a switch. Figure out what lamps youre going to string up and how bright you want them to be.  This gives you a goal to shoot for when making the trick lightbulb.If you are going to use dim incandescent bulbs they turn much more yellow at lower voltages so your trick bulb would probably have to be a mix of white and yellow LEDs to achieve that color.If I were in your shoes I would then just try playing with a small groups of ultrabright LEDs until I achieved the desired effect that would run on a small lt volt lithium battery.,electricians,d4nhjp7,2,t5_2slrm

Then the ACs  goes down to the wall switch the switch leg then back up again to the ceiling and into the lights .

Power the Sonoff with the ACs  from the light box then feed Sonoffs outputted  back to the light. Simultaneously have the ACs  connected to the light like now then still have its  going to the wall switch and back to the light to turn the light on or off like now.This is my wiring plan Would this wiring setup work to control the light with both Sonoff and the wall switch?

Connect these to the matching wires on the PMT.The datalogger you have has two terminals for each channel. Connect the analog output of the PMT to the  terminal connect ground to the  terminal.From the picture it looks like you have three wires going in  a red and a black wire the two on the left which look like the DC supply for the PMT.

However I dont believe any of my auxiliary devices will be capable of affecting the starter battery to the effect of it being flattened while the ignitionengine is on since Ive got a huge battery bank compared to my needs and while the solenoid is closed the alternator will be charging them simultaneously.

This was connected to the hot wire from the switch and the hot wire of the ballast in the original configuration.This is your problem. The yellow leads should not connect to the line power at all. The ballast is powered through the dedicated hot and neutral wires black and white. Just separate the yellows into two sets and follow the wiring diagram on the ballast provided you didnt cook the ballast by hooking it up the other way.For future reference Always follow the provided wiring diagrams that are located on the equipment.

They have been around for a long time the metal frame of the light carries a voltage and every time you dicharge that to ground by touching the metal frame anywherw you trigger the switch. In the few times I have had the chance to play with them they do sometimes function as you seem to have described. This ciould explain tripping out your protection while it is off as I believe they have a decent amount of stored energy via capacitors for the static swithing proces. Once again just a guess.

9585419,0,t1_d9ujc1a,In response to the last paragraph. I or an electrician will be doing all of the work and they would have all the relevant information. At no point in any likely scenario would someone do any work on it. Its a somewhat temporary solution that will be removed in say less than a few years. Unless I die randomly during that time period I am confident no one else would work on it at all. As for why not add another ? Simple answer is cost. The breaker panel can accept up to a  wire if I go with the standard loweshome depot wire which is  quadruplex Id have to change the panel and the conduit. If I am able to find some cheapish  copper or  aluminum Id just have to change out the conduit. Why spend  dollars when you can spend less than ? Also can you speak to what kidcharm said?

I think you had a problem with your neutral connection which caused goofy voltages throughout your house. The utility stated that there wasnt a problem on their end they may or may not be correct. Have your electrician THOROUGHLY check all your neutral connections including the connections in the meter. Have them take voltage readings throughout the house.

The outlets with the screw clamp style back wiring do make a decent connection but those cost more than the cheap outlets with backstab connections and contractorsbuilders are too cheap to pay for them. As far as AFCIs its kind of an inherently hard problem to distinguish arcing from normal circuit operation especially with the newer combustion AFCIs that detect both series and parallel arcs. However the quality control on some of them has been suspect at times. I had one Siemens AFCI that I installed in our house that would immediately trip on any load if the main and branch breakers were turned on in a certain order.

When I do coordination studies its within the scope of an arc flash hazard study so its usually panel to panel and less about coordinating branch breakers to receptacles or lights within a panel to its main though it does happen. In the case above if a LG Fault in a light was in a pretty large building I dont have a oneline or schematic to know the fault should not have shut down the main service to kick on the generator. It should have been limited to the the Lighting panel at best or the branch at which there were other branches in parallel.

When you lost a leg from the utility the motor tried to run single phase on the other two and one of those fuses blew.If a fuse blew unless it IS your overload protection why didnt your overloads trip and shut off the entire control circuit?  It sounds like you dont have properly sized overloads and possibly improperly sized fuses.Why do you care about the inrush current?  You size your overloads based off of the nameplate fullloadcurrent and your fuses off of the tables in the back of .  If your fuses and overloads are insufficient to start the motor then the NEC provides exceptions to increase the size of both of them.This sounds like a control circuit issue to me rather than a fuseoverloadsize issue.

11274565,0,t1_df9dgyz,The middle pole always runs hotter because it sits in the ambient heat generated by A and C. If the connection was already marginal and it looks like it was because the lineside appears clean then you add in normal operating heat and you start a cascading failure  Resistance causes heat which causes oxidation which causes resistance which causes more heat.  Running it at full load leaves absolutely no room for error.Pull the top off that thing and look at the contacts on all three phases but my guess is this was a simple highresistance wire termination.

With one hot and an open neutral you were reading  volts to ground on both the unenergized hot and the neutral because you were reading through a load somewhere. When you completed the neutral splice half of the multiwire circuit worked but because half of it was off you got zero reading on the receptacle you were troubleshooting. You should dig a little deeper into this because you dont want a multiwire circuit with both hots on the same phase. ,electricians,dg4nx6p,4,t5_2slrm
