3764728,0,t1_cqkb3xp,If you turn on the controller and it states v.. for your firmware that means you have the latest for your scope. I would try using two other alignment stars and see if your scope will find a deep sky object. If you have a mm plossl i expect that the telescope will put the object  in the field of view. If its still off let me know..,Jupiters,cqleoeq,1,t5_35o7v
