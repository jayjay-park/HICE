19931,0,t1_cegoqnz,Thank you and please do! Im not sure if its an Ulcer from what Ive heard ulcers are unbearable pain. I just had discomfortslight pain. Perhaps its inflammation? I lost  lbs in a month and a half and that concerned me. Yes they did do a complete blood count I remember him telling me red blood cells white blood cells and everything else was normalI did have a slight elevation in blood sugar and cholesterol and slightly elevated blood pressureI have since gotten on medication. But with the weight  loss I actually cleaned up my whole diet during those sick months was excersizing quit binge drinking on the weekends quit smoking and was generally depressed about the whole ordeal. I wonder if that has got anything  to do with my weight loss. ,leangains,cegpadn,1,t5_2saqe
24077,0,t1_cegrkt5,well I must say I agree with starting with the bar as a complete beginner in the starting phase of the program. Im not joking when I say I never have lifted weights in my life before this and instead did a crap ton of distance running so I was kind of in the hole in both regards.    however the OHP was really hard for me I must say and no I did not raise weights every time due to the fact I kept failing sets when it got over  lbs. I also kept it on the lighter side because I couldnt do it heavier without having good formI still have to learn how to do it with good form. I also think I was way too caught up in my squat to really focus on learning the other lifts to the same degree not that i didnt think about them tldr probably didnt follow the program as well as i thought i did. ,leangains,ceh6a2x,1,t5_2saqe

53685,0,t3_1upwd2,I have similar stats mid s being the major difference. You need to count your calories. Dont trust your body to tell you how much to eat you know that mother fucker lies. If you like keto stick with it just count those calories. You need about  grams of fiber and I have problems hitting that on keto.Did you lift weights in the past? If so just keep cutting down to around . If you havent your body could likely add some muscle and still be in homeostasis. Youll need about . hours a week for a good program like starting strength or gray skull.Good luck!,leangains,cekjiy7,1,t5_2saqe

76473,0,t3_1uz9wz,Depends on what you want to work on more. Pull ups use both your lats and biceps with the wider your grip the more it works your lats and less your biceps. Whereas chin ups primarily work your biceps. It really depends on the rest of your work outs and the muscle groups you hit. People also like to do pull ups over chin ups as it replicates climbing more  pulling yourself from the edge of a cliff would be done with a pull up motion and not a chin up motion.,leangains,cen4vdp,2,t5_2saqe

143069,0,t1_ces9co2,The first set is where you make progress. You try to beat last weeks workout in reps or weight. This set provides the muscle stimulus for growth. Technically this is all you need to grow if done properly.  Any further strain on the muscle limits recovery ability which is why you see many guys doing high volume for years never making any improvements.Also one allout set means you can really focus on intensity and hit the muscle a lot harder than on high volume where people tend to go through the motions. If you only get one set you better make it count. Martin is also a minimalist the idea being why spend more time in the gym working out and planning with a longermore complex workout if a simplershortermore effective version exists?If you were reading carefully the effortsaving question in your post should be answered.

If you start to straighten your legs first before pulling your back will become more parallel with the ground forcing you to round a bit in order to pull the weight so try pulling at the same time as straightening your legs. I only say this because you asked for a critique and its better to work on it now rather than try to pull heavy and injure yourself.

1193055,0,t1_ci3tyrn,I think I might be training too much! I am not meant to do any cardio because of RPT training but I need to for the  miles of tough mudder next month! Strength wise I have never been stronger but that is probably relative I learned to leave the go at the door when I go to the gym!

1238814,0,t1_ci8w00i,Agreed. I think the volume of  is what creates DOMS that will prevent some of the big sets on following workouts. Id modify it to a x routine.Beyond  BBB has a less BBB variation where youd follow up OHP with Bench Deadlift with Squat and vice versa.If youd like more volume on the main exercise hit the First set last for  sets of  reps.The powerlifter routine is where you switch  with   giving you better recovery for the  week. is simple easy to follow and it works.

1295214,0,t1_ciexpyd,Science guy here. Semirecently graduated from a STEM powerhouse with a BS in a biological sciences field and applying to medical schools. Lets see if any of that is worth anything.  gt The reaction from ethanol to carbon dioxide and water is a complex one that proceeds in three steps. Below the Gibbs Free Energy of Formation for each step is shown with Gf values given in the CRC.gtComplete Reaction CHOEthanolCHOAcetaldehydeCHOacetic Acid AcetylCoAHOCO  This is the way alcohol is metabolized. You ingest ethanol ADH converts it into acetaldehyde which is then metabolized to acetic acid which is further metabolized to the final products that are finally either excreted or used.  gt Gf   Gfp  Gfo  Understanding this is crucial. This is the idea of Gibbs Free Energy in mathematical format. This is the subject of many biological science classes that can take weeks to master but can be summed up as the following The energy difference between products and reactants is energy available to do work. Reactants are on the left and products on the right of a chemical reaction. In a simplified equation form it would be      Energy available to do stuff  Energy released when bonds form  Energy required to break bonds  Positive values mean that the reaction is endergonic and thus requires energy to proceed forward. Negative values mean the reaction is exergonic and thus releases energy when proceeding forward. This is one of the most confusing parts of Gibbs Free Energy. For the basis of understanding the whole picture just remember that a negative Gf means that the reaction releases energy and that a positive Gf means the reaction needs energy to go forward.  Just as important an idea is that each step in a reaction has a Gibbs value and the sum of each Gibbs value in a multistep mechanism gives you the Gibbs value for the whole reaction. It is the overall Gibbs Free Energy value that determines if the reaction proceeds forward or not.  This should make more sense once I quote the rest of the wiki page.It may seem weird thinking that an energy surplus downstream in a multistep mechanism forces the unfavorable beginning of the reaction to proceed but science is weird like that. However many mechanisms are like this. For example the beginning half of glycolysis is endergonic while the latter half is extremely exergonic thus taking place at an amazing speed in most biological organisms. But I digress.  gt Step One Ethanol . kJmol  EthanalAcetaldehyde . kJmol  Gf  .  .  . kJmolEndergonic  Gf  . kJmol Endergonic  gt Step Two Ethanal . kJmol  Acetic Acid . kJmol  Gf  .  .  . kJmol Exergonic  Gf  . kJmol Exergonicgt Step Four Because the Gibbs energy is a state function we can skip the AcetylCoA step  for which themodynamic values are not known.  Acetic Acid . kJmol  HOCO  . kJmol  Gf     .   . kJmol Exergonic  Gf   . kJmol Exergonic  I have bolded the most important parts of the above quote.  The first bolded part Gf  .  .  . kJmolEndergonic pertains to the very first reaction in the mechanism Ethanol  Acetaldehyde.  The positive value of Gf shows that this reaction requires energy. However that isnt a problem since our bodies are full of freefloating ATP. The reaction will take place and go on to the next bolded part.  The next important part is Gf  .  .  . kJmol Exergonic. This is the Gf value for Acetaldehyde  Acetic Acid. This is an exergonic reaction thereby releasing energy while proceeding.   Before we move onto the next bolded part let me highlight something that will be important after the next quoted section. Take a look at the following Gf  . kJmol Exergonic. This under the second bolded part shows the sum of the Gibbs Free Energy up until this point.  It is a negative value meaning the first step plus the second step ends with a net release of energy into the system. A net release of energy into the system is the fundamental source of dietary calories.  Humans have not empirically determined the Gf for the third step in the mechanism Acetic Acid  AcetylCoA. However this is not important since we have determined the rest of the values. Think of it as A  B  C  D  F. Science has measured everything but C and thus can solve for the unknown. However this isnt important for our purposes.  The next bolded section Gf     .   . kJmol Exergonic shows the Gf for AcetylCoA   HO   CO. This is a very high energy reaction as can be concluded from the highly exergonic value. The total Gibbs Free Energy at the end of the mechanism is Gf   . kJmol Exergonic.  I believe the highenergy nature may be due to AcetylCoA being the substrate for the TCA cycle which provides the great majority of electron donors for the electron transport chain which in turn provides the great majority of bodily ATP. However it might need to be shuttled to the mitochondrial matrix because I am fairly certain our mechanism doesnt take place in the mitochondria. This aside isnt needed to understand the subject just something that I found worth mentioning for the sake of general knowledge.  gt If catabolism of alcohol goes all the way to completion then we have a very exothermic event yielding some   kJmol of energy. If the reaction stops part way through the metabolic pathways which happens because acetic acid is excreted in the urine after drinking then not nearly as much energy can be derived from alcohol indeed only . kJmol. At the very least the theoretical limits on energy yield are determined to be . kJmol to  . kJmol.  If catabolism meaning the breakdown of a reactant goes all the way to completion then the last Gf value  . kJmol would be the caloric basis of drinking alcohol.   However acetic acid is known to be released in greater concentrationsquantities after drinking alcohol. This can only mean that some of the reaction stops prematurely thereby only releasing Gf of . kJmol.  This difference is very large.  Therefore the catabolism of ethanol lies somewhere between  kJmol and  kJmol.  This means the dietary caloric value of alcohol ethanol can be variable. It can possibly be high or low.  gt It is also important to note that step  on this reaction is endothermic requiring . kJmol of alcohol or about  molecules of ATP adenosine triphosphate per molecule of ethanol.  I honestly dont know why they included this sentence at the end. It is unneeded as it adds nothing to the discussion. It just restates something that should be obvious above and possibly misleads the reader.  No proofreading submission. I like to live dangerously like that. e I lied.,leangains,cifbtxy,17,t5_2saqe

Everyone probably eats a balance of carbs proteins and fats.  EVERYONE who does any sort of weightlifting probably knows to up their protein.  Therefore Id say everyone eats more than adequate macro ratios to make progress if they train and rest properly.People are literally more obsessed with the idea of leangains like its a hobby than training hard enough to force your body to destroy and rebuild itself.And what makes it worse if people read these shit sites then think its all about the macros bro.Why dont you think Martin specifically or definitively outlines macros once on his site?  It isnt to make you pay for it like its the secret.  Its because success is down your BEHAVIOUR and CONSISTENCY OVER A LONG TIME.  You guys will literally never make any progress whatsoever if you endlessly worry about your fucking fat macros like it will make or break your entire system.

In short repping  squats will make you better and slightly stronger at squatting  reps but it has little cross over into actual muscle building pure strength.

Cutting takes more discipline than a lot of people realize and if youre working out MWF hitting min fats and g of protein or more chances are you wont lose strength. Youre lbs and very very fat you can BURN through that shit so fast if you have the discipline to do it right. And you are heavily overestimating your TDEE cus thats not  in my guess.

3138118,0,t1_con97od,That is actually not true.  Fat is an extremely dense form of energy and subsequently the pathways for using it as energy are much more complex.  Your body will go into a catabolic state during training much more readily without the presence of a readily digestible fuel source.  However fasted training does increase fat oxidation rates and increase insulin sensitivity for PWO nutrition.  Fasted training is not ideal for strength optimization but it is ideal for fat loss.  So essentiallyFat loss  fasted training  protein and leucine PWO followed by carbsStrength and muscle gain  carbs  protein PrWO carbs intraworkout carbs  protein PWOA middleground is to eliminate intraworkout carbs to get some of the benefits of increased fat oxidation and insulin sensitivity.,leangains,con9gob,1,t5_2saqe

Food Poisoning.Like minutes and many other people who have been on it for while I use a twomenu scheme for trainingoff days.  After squatting pretty hard Monday my standard postmeal fucking destroyed me.  I went from .. in just over twelve hours.  Weighed in at . this morning though I have been crushing fluids in conjunction with carbs for  hours.  Funnily LG helped me immediately recognize the culprit because of my retarded repetitive eating.  And I started a cut on  February...or so I thought.  I guess I REALLY started on  March.

The stronger you get the more rest days your lifts will require. Some will recover faster than others and as a result can be hit with a higher frequency.Your routine looks good with the exception of neglecting additional shoulder work. I would suggest adding OHP instead of Chins. Chins and Pullups should be supplemented to either day.gt How accurate are standard body weight scales when it comes to body fat  measurement?

But theres a reason that Martin discouraged HIIT and heavy lifting. Sure theres guys like Alex Viada who claim to deadlift obscene weight and run a sub five minute mile. But I had this very same question before I started training. Could I progress rapidly on the bike while continuing to lift with high intensity and get stronger? I couldnt. Could I maintain the same strict discipline over caloric intake while craving heavy refuels and going on rides that burned  calories? No I couldnt. That doesnt mean its not possible.

4718150,0,t3_3fiyxc,Getting down to it it doesnt matter what you choose to do so long as youre committed believe in yourself and push hard with what ever program you choose. As a natural lifter the single biggest factor for increased muscle is by getting stronger. And there are a lot of methods to do that. It doesnt matter what you do as long as it happens. Sometimes that means personal preference and what level youre at in your training like obviously dont run a smolov jr. bench when your rm is .Personally I loved the RPT style of training since it shortened my routines and increased the number of exercises I could fit in a session and more easily track my lifts which has become especially handy for my  day a week full body routine Ive done on my bulk im a bodybuilder at heart and frequency and intensity has been the pointto for natural muscle building which allows me to add weight in the quickest most efficient manner. I love the actual minutes RPT template for cutting. If more volume or frequency will keep your weights up or increasing do that but remember LeanGains and everything pertaining to the literal guidelines is in place for the minimalist approach for maximum gains. In the end its how youd like to go about things to keep your strength increasing.,leangains,ctp9exg,2,t5_2saqe

4805969,0,t1_cu09ndj,No I dont have some calorie bank that I add and subtract from. From experience Ive simply found for optimal muscle building and satiety that I need to eat that many calories on training days.Fat intake on rest days isnt limited because Im in a deficit on those days fat intake can be as high as I like since it wont be stored.  I only limit fat on training days because on those days im in a surplus.People who are in a constant surplus every day on a bulk are using an archaic and outdated method of gaining muscle it is simply a fantastic way to get fat while gaining muscle. What this will often lead to is a short bulk cycle of  weeks followed by a  week or so cut to get rid of all the fat they gained. The way I operate I can bulk for  months straight which allows for greater muscular gains over a sustained period of time. Whilst also staying very lean. Its not like I invented this its used by a lot of natural body builders who are clued up.This is one my favourite articles on the truth about bulking...and it contains a great analogy for bulking drug free.A simple analogy I got from a guy on youtube who operates the same policy isThink of your body as a house. Youve hired some workers to build this house. Now you want to deliver the materials food required for building this house when the workers are most motivated to get the work done post gym  anabolic. When the workers are least motivated rest days you want to underdeliver on materials as theyre not so motivated the materials would just pile up and not be put to good use building the house fat gain.Basically eat more when your body is anabolic post gym and eat less under or at maintenance on rest days to avoid excessive fat gain.People tend to think in such a linear fashion of days of the week when talking about nutrition and bodybuilding. Youve given your body everything it needs to grow for that workout in the post workout window. Just because youve woken up the next day your body hasnt suddenly reset. Its still processing and assimilating all of the materials you gave it the following day. You dont then need to go and provide it with an overload of yet more materials on a day when youre not physically exerting yourself. You just need to give it time to repair itself using the materials youve already provided.,leangains,cu0byo6,3,t5_2saqe

For me personally Ive used them every Sunday when dieting down. Using a time limit. So eating low fat high carb foods for say  hours. Then back onto normal diet. Most of the time I couldnt fit anymore food in as the refeeds were based on hunger. The leaner I got the longer the load. I figure at the end of the day you know how you tick. If you know you cant handle them because you lack self control then stick to using workout days as your refeeds. Some claim theyre stupid.

5500506,0,t1_cwei0ta,Is there an intermediate guide you might recommend on this? I hit my weight goal and am cycling and making good gains but I notice I perform best in the morning or any time until I eat. What seems to work best is almost the opposite taking a crude interpretation of the basics or rather a shift where I eat a surplus the day before but with a big emphasis on getting those calories late in the day rest day. Then workout hard the next day without eating anything in the previous  hours including sleep then eating heartily once I am finished.Going by days and TDEE this has me eating a surplus on rest days and deficit on workout days though gross calorie consumption on workout days is higher due to higher TDEE. Am I interpreting the recommended routine too dogmatically and doing things right or cheating myself? This has been more an observation when I run out if time and making things up rather than a designed plan but dont want to go crazy with a little anecdotal evidence. ,leangains,cweqp9p,3,t5_2saqe

5562549,0,t3_3rah94,There was  the other day as well. Menno has yet again concluded that .gkg is enough but the Update by Eric Helms makes sense as to why one would go over that.On eating truckloads of proteingtHowever recent research by Antonio comparing .gkg to .gkg found that a much larger number of participants dropped out of the .gkg group and that bodyweight gain was much less than expected based on selfreported energy intake in the .gkg group  In my opinion this indicates a satiating effect of protein that extends past the .gkg level and that the participants in the .gkg group didnt consume as many calories as they thought they did. A follow up study comparing .gkg to .gkg found more weight was gained in the .gkg group while the .gkg group lost more fat despite a larger selfreported energy intake. Again I would put forth this likely shows a satiating effect of the higher protein intake and subsequent over reporting of caloric intake which would explain less weight gained and fat lost in the .gkg group  To conclude while it is possible that the differential effects on mood found in the higher protein group in my study are due to the higher sugar intake in the lower protein group I think it would be premature to conclude this based on the wellestablished satiating power of protein and the murkier role of sugar.Since you will be looking for it by HelmsgtWe cant know for sure that the confounding variables in each of these studies fully explains their findings and thats enough to make me more comfortable prescribing .gkg as a minimum intake versus a solitary intake to ensure I cover the possibility of it being too little in some cases. For the record I normally prescribe either ..gkg of total body mass or gkg of lean body mass for protein intake for recreational and competitive strength and physique athletes. Using the lower half for a caloric surplusmaintenance and the upper half for a deficit.tldr .gkg is minimum though it depends on the individual and their level of activity,leangains,cwml25w,0,t5_2saqe

If you are training every day you should be eating the same macros every day.  So if things are going good now dont change anything.  If not always look at your protein first maybe bump it up.

7715292,0,t3_4kzl2a,Great post  Ive only been doing LG for a few months and this is great advice especially for relative newbies like me in avoiding potential plateaus.  The biggest issue Ive run in to is alcohol consumption. I know there are some who are able to drink moderately and maintain consistent results on LG but for the most part this appears to be the anomaly. Im a recovering alcoholic so my choice to stop drinking was initially unrelated to lifting. However the awesome byproduct of removing alcohol without much change to the rest of my diet is that LG is now working fantastically for me. Alcohol has such a ridiculously high calorie count its astonishing  a pint of vodka has over a thousand freakin calories. If youre at all watching your caloric intake and macros thats a crap ton of calories to be consuming where there is absolutely zero nutritional contribution.,leangains,d3j6cdd,3,t5_2saqe

7896985,0,t1_d43o8ta,I think there are several factors that went into me breaking my stall. This is only my second week of Greyskull LP and I got the fractional plates for this program as the manual recommends. I had been stalling on my bench press for a while and I think a lot of it was mental. I had tried deloading and it didnt help very much I basically got stuck at a lower weight. I attribute my breaking the stall mostly to the new program I think I needed a change and mixing things up helped me to look at my lifts with new eyes thus breaking the mental stall. Plus benching AB having two bench days every other week is hopefully going to help me gain more than benching every Wednesday. I would agree that my stall had a large mental factor and I dont attribute breaking the stall to the fractional plates. The fractional plates were merely an addition to my program when I started Greyskull and I attribute a program change to overcoming my stall. The fractional plates were only a small part of this program change. ,leangains,d43p0c2,2,t5_2saqe

8181757,0,t3_4rdx75,Your lifts are similar to mine Im   in a bulk. My lifts are stagnated since I was forced to take Feb through April off due to an intense school workload and work. For reference I started with RPT as a beginner with some exposure to the big lifts I have no regrets in the approach but Ive since learned more by doing a few weeks of SS. I just wrapped up SS to regain some of the strength I lost from the break now Im contemplating a return to RPT or following this I started LGIF as a beginner lifter and went straight probably incorrectly to a cut. I didnt have much muscle to show but by eating appropriately I was still seeing beginner gains in both strength and muscle mass. Im glad I went that way because it showed me the approach works. Now I dont mind packing on mass with a little fat because the cuts are stupid effective and even over the period of a few light eating rest days I can peak at bulk progress. This is a long way of saying that your lifts can keep progressing during a cut. Be mindful of form be mindful of lifting heavy and consistently adding increments each week to the bar and youll get the progress youre after. ,leangains,d509po7,2,t5_2saqe

At some point youre going to have to accept that getting lean and slowly adding mass is the only way this can be done.

For instance its advised not to do LISS after training legs. It is fine after training upper body but not the same body group.I believe Cliff Wilson was the one who I heard it from.gt The only problem is that during the entire time any type of cardio is being performed your body is in a catabolic state and it is breaking down muscle tissue for energy.

I lost too much muscle and stopped. On my most recent bulk attempt I was gaining at  pounds per week  I gained too much fat and had to stop.  all though I regained the lost cut muscle and then some.  Now Im I was going to aim for a slower bulk  but Im reeeaaaallly not happy with the stomach pudge.   So Im thinking about doing a slow cut . pounds a week to lose the pudge.  but that seeems like a reeeeallly long time. and part of me once to do the fast cut  then start my bulk at a slower rate.

9365792,0,t3_58tlon,Youll just need to eat less to cut. That simple. Cardio isnt a magic answer  calories in vs spent is what matters. You might be able to make some gains on a cut but mostly a cut is about maintaining the muscle you have while cutting fat. A few things Id suggest. . Switch to a  day routine like starting strength. . Do x. . Do cardio if you want  but its not necessary.. If you do cardio then do it after weights or on non lifting days. Or different times of the day if you have that luxury. . Im a fan of low impact cardio. I do fast step ups on a gym step stool. Swimming or biking are also options. But if you have the energy for it then sure  do HIIT. Caloric deficit is what is most important. ,leangains,d936jas,1,t5_2saqe

9629825,0,t3_5cvmhc, quick questions re mins workout. Yes it sounds like im overthinking but im actually not im just curious.. can i do chins first then OHP? Because my chins arent progressing much because Im tired from OHP. This is splitting hairs probably but Martin seems to really emphasize chins doesnt mention OHP much.. Inc DB Bench..does it have to be DB? Can I just use a bar? I ask because for BP he doesnt specify DB. Again got me curious if theres a reason.. Backsupported rows...I never did these before and I dont really like it. Can i do another exercise that hits those muscles?. I prefer cable for killing my triceps not big on Tri Ext  can i do whatever exercise I want for tris?I think this is  weeks of doing min and my strength is insane. I never did squats or deads or chins before so my s are super low but im scaling up fast and for me my s are awesome. For example i started squatting the bar now im up to a plate on each side this week Ill be adding  pounds. Deads are similar in progression but my chest is just insane. I had so much strength today i easily benched  x...i think could have done . That is a record for me  was always my highest. I didnt even need a spot. My chins are just horrible I still need a spot to do them. Currently weigh  was  in sept stalled on weight loss last couple weeks but strength is crazy and energy levels are crazy.

11470272,0,t1_dfvq078,Link the aforementioned study bro. Would be interested to see this research. I thought muscle protein synthesis peaked around  hours after resistance training and continues up to like  hours. Isnt this why people say brosplits that target areas only  time a week are suboptimal? ,leangains,dfw5ec0,1,t5_2saqe

11526327,0,t1_dg2i41b,Martin trained a lot for those high rep competitions IIRC where he literally did  reps of certain movements.However I didnt really mean high rep i ment higher volume.IMO higher volume is the key driver whether your split that up into many sets or not is secondary in importance. ,leangains,dg2iekh,1,t5_2saqe
11556870,0,t3_64sd34,I have trouble doing bench due to some shoulder issues so I do fly  times a week based on some advice on this sub. Its not a perfect replacement but helps with muscle development in that area.And as others have said  be patient and stick to your macro goals. The fat will come away over time. ,leangains,dg5z47e,1,t5_2saqe
11592034,0,t3_65f53i,Id recommend making your own preworkout by buying the individual ingredients in bulk. That way you can use the optimal doses and save a ton of money. Consider getting creatine gservingbeta alanine gservingcaffeine pills mg but adjust to tolerancecitrulline malate gEach of these can be bought from Bulk Supplements on Amazon for significantly cheaper per serving than buying commercialized preworkout.,leangains,dg9yrfb,1,t5_2saqe

11667794,0,t3_66huso,My main concern would be that youre overestimating your TDEEs. Yours may be correct because youre pretty tall but hers is almost definitely not right unless shes reaaaaally athletic. Also theres absolutely no way shes only  bodyfat at  and lbs  for a man to get that big they would probably need drugs. For a woman to get that big is a physical impossibility. ,leangains,dgik63c,2,t5_2saqe
