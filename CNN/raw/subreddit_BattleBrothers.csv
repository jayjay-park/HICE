6920689,0,t3_4aify6,what is your party composition?shields are really important and spears for spearwall are very good against melees oponents like the werewolves. I have  ranged melee characters. some melees use javelinesspiked bolas before engaging in melee combat.My strategy against werewolves is wait using space bar till them are in range for my archersjaveline throwers and make an spearwall a taunt make it easier. when they are in melee I use a couple of macers to stun them and the swords to execute em.No axes are needed in this fight.,BattleBrothers,d10s86y,2,t5_380v5

10952052,0,t1_de59lon,Actually I have found some issues with one skull difficulty fights at the beginning veteran difficulty.  Not the fight itself but the battered way my troop will exit it even after winning. I find myself having to put one or two guys in reserve bringing my eight man team down to six and sometimes my six man team down to four.  Although the dagger trick is really helping my armour early on. ,BattleBrothers,de9mk6f,1,t5_380v5

11316360,0,t1_dfen3uk,Youll probably want to swap out those spear bros for hammer bros flail bros or something along the like. Swords and Spears are good for bros early on because they have a bonus to hit on the primary attack but dont do very much damage especially to armor this is particularly true for spears. Later on when you start fighting Orc Warriors and the Skeleton Phalanxes you just wont have enough punch to get through their armor before they tear you to pieces. Consider some Greatsword amp  or a Maul bro as well although I am partial to the Greatsword which I think is probably the best weapon in the game. ,BattleBrothers,dfeow1c,3,t5_380v5
11331113,0,t1_dfg3aep,I had  spearwall front  polearms  crossbow.  It was tough vs undead who also had spears.  They would shield wall then jump in.  My spear dps after when doing shieldwall   hit.After a reload going  spear thrusts instead of shield walls  thrust works better.Repel with pikes or pitch forks dont work too well so just poke them more.  A  range axe would be better than a pike at that point but those are expensive.,BattleBrothers,dfgd2fr,1,t5_380v5
11396207,0,t1_dfnmb5m,Thats how I thought it worked. Like you had a higher chance of a kill if they had no head gear or itd been destroyed. Seems its not quite so nuanced. ,BattleBrothers,dfnqtop,2,t5_380v5
11429235,0,t1_dfqglfl,Polearms with a  tile reach are really good in the early game if you get a really good recruitgood stars or traits or both and you want to level him safely without risking his life or a permanent injury since you can stand him behind the line and he can still contribute and get kills.To use the normal handers you generally need to wait because your guys are way too vulnerable without a shield. Its probably good to wait until they have pretty high base melee defense  as well as the reach advantage perk which gives extra melee defense when you hit enemies. He should also have enough fatigue to wear  armor and still have  fatigue. The big advantage of two handers is that they do sigificantly more damage and they have AOE attacks that can hit multiple enemies and also they use less stamina than a hander and a shield. If your brother has enough defensive skills and good enough armor to still be safe its usually good to switch because when you start getting far into the game you end up going against so many enemies and theyre so strong that just playing defensively behind shields means your guys run out of fatigue when theres still  enemies left and you get overrun.,BattleBrothers,dfrhpg0,1,t5_380v5
11434803,0,t1_dfrvr9y,Whats the problem with having bad melee skill and using longaxes? I cant recall ever having less than  chance to hit a shield with an axe even with abysmal melee skill. ,BattleBrothers,dfs4gij,1,t5_380v5

The reality is my obituary page is a lot less than it actually is.  lots of guys get a permanent injury and are just dismissed.  if we consider those its probably more like  or ?I have had worse though my last run had  dead by ish days.
