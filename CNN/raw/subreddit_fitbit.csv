The first few weeks Id forget to put it back on if I took it off for some reason but since I got it in April Ive been much better.The One and the Flex both track sleep.  I personally use it to see how my exercise has improved my sleep since I used to have a hard time sleeping through the night.  I would wake up fully awake about x a night for at least  minutes and sometimes have to pace.

What it does is add my calorie burn for  minutes of biking BUT it still counts those fake steps that were created during the biking on top of that so the caloric burn is wrong.

2241800,0,t3_2d6sz2,This error is seen if there are two trackers near the computer when you do the sync. It tries to communicate with both of them and one or the other fails because you have three devices all trying to send Bluetooth packets at the same time. Then it helpfully reports an error as if the failed communication was because of a low battery condition. So try moving the other One  or more feet away from the laptop before doing an ondemand sync... or just let it sync automatically if youre a little more patient.,fitbit,closbdm,2,t5_2tat5

Needless to say many a day I barely got k but those lunchtime walks etc made a big pact towards k and that was a real motivation for me.

2752512,0,t3_2rith3,I just got the Surge delivered to me today and I am wearing it right now. I am surprised how light it feels because it didnt look light. Im coming from a Flex and I have difficulty setting the sleep mode so I am looking forward to autosleep.The strap is wider and it has to be placed a little higher on the wristarm for the HR reading and that is something I am getting used to. I did have to get used to wearing the flex and I did so hopefully this I can get used to feeling this too. The height off the arm is high too but I hope I can get use to that. When I compared the Surge and Charge HR in Best Buy they did almost have the same height. The surge is just wider.GPS is cool because I dont always want to have to start an app on my phone just to track my walkrun. Its already recording. I like the calltext notifications because I work in a call center that is starting to crack down on cell phone use like looking at my phone and reading Reddit in between calls. So if I can quickly see who is callingtexting me I can see if its worth it to get my phone out.Ive been doing a lot of reading on forums both here and on fitbit.com and a lot of people are having more issues with the Charge HR than the Surge. I decided to go topoftheline because I figured that the Surge would be the device most supported and updated. In a few months if the tangerine version gets released I may buy that and sell the black on eBay. I really dont like how it looks like a black blob on my arm. I am very pale too. I think a brighter color might take away how bulky it looks.Anyways Im going to live for a couple weeks with it and decide if I want to keep it.,fitbit,cngy6m8,2,t5_2tat5
2760941,0,t3_2roffw,Just like a cell phone on vibrate my Charge makes some noise when it vibrates I dont think it would be possible for it to be completely silent.

2930825,0,t3_2tmqq5,I got my Charge HR yesterday and when I went to sleep last night I knocked my wrist onto the wall next to our bed.  I was too tired to look at it at that point but this thread reminded me to.  Theres a tiny chip on the top edge of the display.  Its only noticeable at certain angles but still is a bit disappointing.  Never had these issues with my one and they could have protected against this sort of thing by putting a small rubber ridge around the display glassplastic.

4533833,0,t3_3d5k96,I have the Charge HR and would highly recommend it. There was a new upgrade that just came out and it lets you see the time now when you bring up your wrist instead of having to press buttons. You can also tap through all the options to see how many steps calories etc without having to press the button.As for the heart rate option Ive worn it while also wearing my polar heart rate monitor and found that they are pretty similar. It may not be perfectly in sync but the calories burned after different types of workout were less than  calories away from each other so Ive started using only my fitbit during workouts. It does help to wear it higher on your arm during workouts in order to get a better reading on blood circulation. The resting heart rate feature is awesome! I love being able to monitor my fitness that way. Ive dropped it considerable over the last three months so its rewarding to see the change numerically.I had the One before this so I cant totally speak to switching from the Flex but I do know that Id be frustrated if I had to sync in order to view my stats. I love that everything is right there on my wrist whenever I need it.Definitely get it!!,fitbit,ct24fpr,3,t5_2tat5

5949642,0,t1_cxzdeha,Well I hadnt submerged this tracker in water but I had gotten it slightly wet a few times and been in very humid conditions with it.  That seemed to cause the rubber to bubble up and peel off.  By the time I opted to remove it myself it was ridiculously easy to take off.  But the rubber was rather durable could not just be ripped and so a sharp blade to cleanly cut it off is recommended.  I also angled my cuts so that it is less likely to snag on things.  I removed the rubber on topsides from below the display to just above where the screws are underneath.  The exposed black plastic is very smooth and sleek feeling so its no wonder glue does not stick to it very well in fact there was no residue left on it at all!,fitbit,cxzj11w,1,t5_2tat5

It was surprisingly civil.If they are aware of issues it should be public. Instead you end up having to fight for that answer. If they had good customer support they would make the knowledge public. For those of us out of warranty effected by the issue they offer us a  off coupon on a new device of course Amazon has them cheaper than that coupon makes them. They seem completely lost in how to respond to this issue  every support person says something different.Good customer service is this  acknowledging issues publicly informing CSRs of the issue and to direct users to the public statement and offer even an incredibly broad timeline for a fix. For the cost of these devices FitBit doesnt seem to invest in customer service at all.EDIT Bring on the down votes fanboys. My criticism is valid and this company is terrible right now.

6690423,0,t3_4769rd,So I ran into this same problem a few months ago my solution is is similar to what uthecontrolmcl said. You have two major options for tracking. Sync Strava to Fitbit and use Strava to track your ride. This will be simple and get you a good calorie and count on Fitbit but you wont get HR data. This is the best if you want to just use Fitbit for everything.. Sync with Strava I dont anymore I just use Strava for ride tracking and use Fitbit to track your ride as a run and then export the data to TCX and upload to Strava then delete the run on Fitbit because it will calculate the calories as if you were running. Strava will read the TCX which says run but you can just use a drop down menu to change to ride. This will get your ride data and HR data on Strava which will then sync back to Fitbit as a ride. The reason I use the fitbit app to track is because when you export it to stravasmashrunanywhere else you get HR data and Fitbit really sucks for tracking running and riding I just use Strava and Smashrun.ProTip  When running amp riding use the workout mode on your CHR to get it to record your HR every second then delete the activity after syncing. The more accurate HR data will stay and will get applied to your runride! I hope that helped!,fitbit,d0bcjyl,1,t5_2tat5

6782678,0,t3_48kemi,If youve given Fitbit accurate data about your age height and weight it should be pretty accurately calculating your calorie burn using your heart rate data. Its possible that your basal metabolic rate is higher than youve estimated using population averages. Oh and the weird data display is probably Fitbit clashing with workouts you registered manually on the app. Ive had it happen where it will erase steps because I input a workout with distance but not step information.

7204156,0,t3_4e4wyp,One of the many stories of the delightful customer support that Fitbit provides. The screws on the underside of my Surge cracked the surrounding plastic a few months back and I just let it go. After my gf had her charge HR replaced due to a battery issue I decided to check the forums and see if the cracking was a common issue. It turns out its not uncommon so I contacted support and they stayed with me on the live chat for an hour while I searched for the receipt. I eventually went to the JB HiFi I had purchased it from and they had my receipt in their records. Unfortunately at this point i realised it was just outside of warranty. I sent a copy through to fitbit anyway and they confirmed today that a new Surge is on its way. So thanks to Michael B and the fitbit team The image is a photo of my Surge currently.,fitbit,d1x1zqd,3,t5_2tat5

I was almost sold already on just sticking with a blaze but if theres anything I would want to know out of any watch would be the weather outside. Whats the best thing to know before going out for a jog than to prepare what to wear before heading out. It seems essential.

7856488,0,t3_4ml03m,As far as the HR data and step counts accurate enough. The issue you should consider is the quality of the build particularly with the Charge HR. There are many accounts of the band separating bubbling etc. If it happens in the first year theyll replace it. If it happens again within a year of the initial purchase theyll replace again. Once past a year from the initial purchase youre on your own.Both mine and my friends are having the bands fall apart. There was a post here a month ago from a guy that had  or   replacements under the one year warranty between him and his wife. His post is the first link below.I preordered the very first Fitbit and have owned many over the years. I gave then as gifts passed along my old ones when I upgraded. Ive been a big fan and promoter. They have always had quality control issues but in the past theyd always replace them. Now though they are sticking to a policy of one year from initial purchase. By my way of thinking the one year should start over with a replacement. Given how expensive they are getting only a few months use before it starts disintegrating is not acceptable.I know there are many users that havent had these problems but there are enough that it is an issue you should consider before making a decision. ExamplesAfter two replacements in one year for me and two for my wife with both of our current Charge HRs again suffering from the same defects  were done with Fitbit.Expected life span of charge HR?Whats the average longevity of a Charge HR?Fitbit Charge HR  Band LiftingAnother Charge HR down the drain,fitbit,d3z52cu,2,t5_2tat5

8341477,0,t1_d5k6ius,Yep. Lots of data communications issues happen because of the time not being correct or far enough off where the secure channel cant be validated. No one ever thinks its the system time thats causing their issues and most tech support departments are just as guilty for not recognizing it as a problem. The reason I think its something to check in your case is because youre using a standalone pc. Phones and tablets are usually fairly aggressive about time synchronization. Laptops on the other hand dont always have access to an Internet time source like if youre commuting via mass transit with no wireless access. The longer you stay away from an Internet time source the more potential for the correct time to drift. Once you drift a certain duration time synchronization becomes impossible until you manually correct the time to something close. Not saying this is whats happening in your case but its something you can easily rule out. ,fitbit,d5k8lnp,1,t5_2tat5

But this explains it better than I couldSo what you should do is what someone else suggested  and calculate your TDEE elsewhere  and set up whatever deficit you like. Im not sure why fitbit and others just lump exercise calories into your edible calorie pool.  The science has proven that exercise calories dont correlate to an overall consumable pool  so it baffles me why fitness apps insist on doing it this way. If you want to configure a custom calorie limit in the fitbit app  you can follow the instructions in this threadpretty sure you have to change it via the website and not within the app  but the change is reflected in the app after a sync ,fitbit,d6razla,3,t5_2tat5

9704093,0,t3_5e0f2i,My mum just turned  last month also not great with technology but gets on fine on her tablet. I got her the One and she loves it. She can still check her step count on the Fitbit itself through the day without having to get her tablet and find her glasses etc etc. She also bought a wristband that the One pops into from Amazon so she can wear it on her wrist too. Its also one of the cheaper options in case she doesnt like it or does what my mum has already almost done several times accidentally put it in the washing machine. ,fitbit,da98k8c,2,t5_2tat5

9778120,0,t3_5etm0p,I have the Fitbit One. I like it a lot. It clips to your bra or pants pocket. It tracks sleep stairs climbed how active you are during the day calories burned and obviously steps. Ive paired the app to the my fitness pal app to try to help me lose weight. I log my water intake on the fitbit app and my calorie intake on MFP. When I sync my fitbit it shows me how Im doing calorie wise for the day. Its pretty neat. ,fitbit,daida96,1,t5_2tat5
9881797,0,t1_daveymh,Not likely that it will get that low.  I did pick one up on cyber Monday for around .  Not sure if they will get back down that low before Christmas or not. ,fitbit,davme49,1,t5_2tat5

10237286,0,t1_dc4g8dh,Yes it just gives an overall calorie adjustment for the day based on calories burned calculated by Fitbit. You are supposed to say you are sedentary in MFP for it to work properly.,fitbit,dc4gbz6,1,t5_2tat5
10279069,0,t1_dc83rlo,I just had the exact same experience yesterday.  I had two charges that just completely fell apart.  They replaced the first one but refused to replace the second one and only offered  off which just means more money for them and probably a new broken product for me.  Ive liked my fitbit but Im definitely going to go with a different brand this time and Id advise anyone else to look elsewhere too.,fitbit,dc96t0t,1,t5_2tat5

10288048,0,t1_dca7a28,The two feet and the wrist are all moving relative to each other so you cant establish a common reference frame. Youd need either an external fixed point or a ridiculously accurate GPS receiver.You could also buy motion capture equipment and hire a crew to operate it.The only possible way out of this is making the treadmill smart enough to sync its setting to the tracker but Fitbit has very limited power in this matter.,fitbit,dca7foo,3,t5_2tat5
10292488,0,t1_dcankk7,It does add weight compatible to a standard metal watch. I actually prefer it. I like to feel it as the original strap was to light for my liking. I was scared of loosing it.I run about K a week plus an hour  times a week on the elliptical. I also weight train. Other then the inside of the strap getting dirty with sweat stuff which I clean daily I have no complaints. The only time I take it off is when Im fighting sparing or aggressive bag work.,fitbit,dcapjls,6,t5_2tat5

10350659,0,t3_5o7ax4,Hello!  This spreadsheet is the breakdown of the league as of last week.  The post that uonlyoneouiser linked are this weeks promotions and relegations and screenshots of each divisions results.  You were promoted so you moved from Division A to Division A.  That means your invite for this week will be from Elizabeth since shes in charge of that division.  Invites just went out by the time all the challenges sync and we get the new divisions figured out it takes awhile but we try to get them out by Sunday evening!

10579477,0,t1_dd6vqni,I found my Charge to be quite accurate as I hit a  calorie deficit and lost about a pound per week as expected.This seems too easy.Well are you actually losing weight as expected? If not youre probably underestimating your food intake. Many people do. Just a tablespoon of fat is  calories. And something like Asiago Cheese Bagel can have a wide ranging calorie amount depending on the size.,fitbit,dd76vol,7,t5_2tat5
10683334,0,t1_ddhw2ej,Right exactly. At its simplest there could be most active minutes challenges right up to challenges for every type of activity that Fitbit recognizes.,fitbit,ddhwlc2,5,t5_2tat5
10692384,0,t3_5stu4v,i wish challenges included things like distance travelled.One thing im not a fan of when it comes to comparing step counts is people with shorter strides are at an advantage. but then again im bitter because im  foot  and am frequently in challenges with people who are  foot . ,fitbit,ddiu9pq,2,t5_2tat5
10720495,0,t3_5tc8ya,... Does this happen often??

Someone in this sub told me to lower my goal to something more realisticfor me it was  which was what I hit every day. Since then Ive been reaching my realistic and adequate goal and seeing that motivated me to keep on reaching it and Im slowly raising it.Also I bought a couple of bands which is motivating me to make even more use of it!

11605045,0,t1_dgbew78,Ok so if theres a differential between the Charge using the phones GPS and other apps using the phones GPS then they two things must be song something different. Possibly Charge is taking readings less often. Charge applies less smoothing to its readings. Charge uses different bit of the GPS service on the phone. Maybe it only uses the onboard chip whereas the apps almost certainly use the Location service which combines cell WiFi and GPS. Perhaps the fitbit driver only has access to the GPS chip? Or maybe fitbit thought that was enough and its potentially battery saving.,fitbit,dgbfwj5,1,t5_2tat5
11667547,0,t3_66b0xm,I love this idea. It seems way more durable than all these bands too.  And less limiting fashionwise. I normally stick to clips because I dont like most bands looks or advertising that Im tracking with a band.,fitbit,dgij5qn,2,t5_2tat5
