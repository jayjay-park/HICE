80232,0,t3_1uz9e5,Take better care of your employees. Pay them better. Pay the drivers more than absolute minimum wage. Give them yearly raises. Pay drivers more for gas in the delivery charge. Bottom line in my opinion if a company truly cares about their employees and compensates them fairly with wages then production and morale will increase. If that increases then you will have happy employees. Happy employees will be more productive and have more incentive to go the extra mile with product and customer service. They will be more loyal. Your employee retention rate will skyrocket. You will waste less money and time in training new employees if you have ones that want to stay because they are happy making good money and they know the company cares about them. Quit thinking short term profits and think long term profits and success. I dont work for dominos but I feel like my company doesnt give much of a shit about me. In the year and a half Ive been there Ive never gotten a raise except for the increase in minimum wage. If dominos does it dual wages for drivers one for inside and another for driving do away with the cheaper wage. Stop screwing over the little guys that make the money for the company.

Scenario If I have three  stops deliveries on a run and all three  have paid with a credit card Two  have preauthorized a gratuity in excess of  of the order total  and one  of those deliveries has not preauthorized a gratuityI may decide to give preferential treatment to the customers that have already indicated they value the service I am providing them. Your order then may arrive later then it might have if you had preauthorized a gratuity.Mind you I may decide that the two customers that preauthorized a gratuity can wait because I dont know what you may tip so I may decide to get your order to you fastest in the hope that youll provide a gratuity commensurate with the speed of service I provided you. But if you decide that the speed of service wasnt worth my effort I would most likely place you back to the end.I also have a problem with preauthorized gratuities since they are predetermining what my gratuity is without taking into consideration what level of service I provided. Very rarely has a customer ever increased a preauthorized gratuity for excellent service maybe  times for more than  deliveries. Although I do not remember a customer ever decreasing a preauthorized gratuity. BUT I have experienced many orders that included preauthorized gratuities being cancelledbad ordered because of a complaint which results in my gratuity disappearing this is another issue entirely though.Edit Formattingwords,TalesFromThePizzaGuy,cfzeoin,13,t5_2uh13

Then youre staying later because I need you to?  gtIts my decision to stay. I try to not let peer pressure make my decisions for me. Its not about peer pressure its about trying to run a business and keep hungry customers from coming thru the phone lines and strangling one of your coworkers.gtI try not to allow my employer to have power over me as much as I am able too. It doesnt have to be a power struggle. It should be about the hiring manager making scheduling expectations clear and an understanding that some days youll go home earlier than expected and some days later than expected.gtEver single minute I spend working for my employer makes them money for that they pay me the absolute minimum that they are forced to pay me. I accept that. In the case of drivers dont forget tips from customers. Regardless of the wage scale more hours is more pay. If you have cool coworkers then hopefully work isnt so bad.gtBut for that amount and for not being willing to increase my pay if I decide to stay later for their primary benefit or put in more effort the my fellow coworkers they receive the type of employee they pay for.Oh yes employers get exactly what they pay for. Its unskilled labor and people get paid pretty much the minimum so a lot of employees put in the absolute minimum. There is a ridiculous amount of turnover  like insane. I was the secondmost senior driver at a store after only a year of service. By the time I hit two years I was the senior driver.

My anchovy pizza would always arrive completely intact!My wife loves em too. She has good taste.In all seriousness Cheap anchovies are flavorless blobs of oil and salt.

6553146,0,t1_czoofc4,gt Minimum wage here is . I make  an hour in the shop or on the road plus tips plus fees. I think were good on that front.You may be good. Ive been thinking about your situation and I was wondering... You say you do not receive any mileage reimbursement but that you do receive a portion of the delivery fee. . of it. What do you think that amount is for? Or what are you told it is for? Unless proven otherwise and I admit you may be able to prove otherwise that amount that you say you receive IS your mileage reimbursement. Or it is not in that case that amount is a portion of your wage. Which means you are effectively paid less per hour than your asserted hour rate. You effective hourly rate would be   the portion of the delivery fee you receive for each hour. Or hour  number of hours worked during the pay period minus the total of the amount of the delivery fee you receive.Or that hr is expected to cover the difference between your applicable minimum wage .hr minus the expenses you incur your unreimbursed mileage and that portion of the delivery fee you receive is not mileage reimbursement. Now if your unreimbursed expenses exceed the difference .hr between your applicable minimum wage .hr and your actual hourly wage hr then your employer would be violating AT LEAST the FLSA. Lets assume your actual or a reasonable approximation mileage rate is . per mile if you drove on average more than . miles per hour you would would be losing money. Now you may be thinking... Its none of that its what I said it is. Id still have to call bullshit. because according to your state law and federal law it has to be one of these options otherwise your employer is likely violating state andor federal law.Remember that portion of the delivery fee you say you receive but is not for mileage cannot be considered a gratuity. If your employer gives any of it to you it is either mileage reimbursement or is considered part of your wage. gt Im going to take the fifth on that one.Good answer... but this is not a court youre not under oath. By answering that way I will believe most likely accurately that you do not report  of your tips. I personally do not care whether you report your tips I think youre doing yourself a disservice by not doing so but it is your decision.gt I dont think the IRS is in the habit of auditing people who are below the median household income. Its not worth their time to hassle every waiter over a few thousand dollars. My spending and lifestyle are well within the parameters of my situation. And since the alleged cash gets spent as cash... lets just say Im not worried.I agree the IRS does not care about you. But it might start caring if your employer gets reported for tax fraud. The IRS might care about your employer and when the IRS starts seeing discrepancies between the employees credit card tips and no cash tips... well then all of you are in a world of hurt. You might get lucky and not get caught... I prefer to not even run the risk of getting caught. In the long run all that stuff doesnt matter to me though... what matters if whether or not your employer is obeying the law and not taking advantage of its employees. Your employer may be doing enough to make you happy that does not mean they are obeying the law. ,TalesFromThePizzaGuy,czx5dcc,1,t5_2uh13

Nah that sucks and it sucks for the neighbors too. Honestly my door bell is broken so Ive added to the notes that its broken and they should call me. He didnt read that sadly. So when he called he was happy I answered. Honesty wish everyone just called my phone instead of rang the bell. Especially back at my parents. Its so far to the front door from upstairs.

The DOL will had this happen before audit them and send you a check from DOL not your employer. Call them and make nothing more of it until they do the audit. Chances are though even though its illegal for them to fire you out of retaliation because people that go against the feds and fuck you over on wages always abide by the law of course that they will fire you for some reason they made up. If youre that worried dont show up early fuck them. Show up EXACTLY on time and if youre able to take pictures of the schedule or have a time slip print out SAVE THEM.

My store runs into this problem from time to time but at least we make the effort to call and ask if this is ok for the customer of if they would prefer another drink instead.For Scenario  if they bring you correct drink and warm assuming its a  liter drink it likely means that they forgot the drink and opted to stop at a nearby store and purchase one there in order to save face the fact that they forgot your drink most convenience stores dont chill their  Liter drinksIts not my proudest moment and ive only done this once but ive done this before due to the distance of the delivery and told them that our cooler was out in order to explain why the drink was room temperature. See commenter belowyou are a good sport for not making a fuss over it though because I can tell you that the driver himself doesnt feel good about the situation either and a disgruntled customer over a drink issue will only make him feel worse for his mistake sort of like the double punishment treatment some kids undergo during their school years by one parent and then the other its just an awful feeling lol,TalesFromThePizzaGuy,d8xflla,3,t5_2uh13
