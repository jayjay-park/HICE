3741707,0,t3_336uqk,The GTTP MarkIII appears to be the same as the FHP and came with a Sainsonic INF antenna. Actually the radio iself only has two small Baofeng logos and the label sais its By Sainsonic for Baofeng.,Baofeng,cqis241,1,t5_2xg76
4244481,0,t1_cs41aqn,Has anyone done this before? Im guessing going down from V to .V is easy enough but what about the amperage?,Baofeng,cs427eu,1,t5_2xg76
4566648,0,t3_3cu66f,Had the same problem. I had the wrong com port set up in CHIRP.   Let us know when you fixed it.  ,Baofeng,ct68n88,1,t5_2xg76
4890240,0,t1_cuanqwo,I wasnt planning on using inside of a vehicle just for the mobile rigs in general. And when I meant restrict Its capability I was refering to how the site said it was for two specific Bands would It work on other bands capable on the mobile rig?,Baofeng,cuaycb4,1,t5_2xg76

5499209,0,t1_cwea6oz,Lots.I went with the Opentracker USB.  It works as a standard TNC with a computer or can do APRS without a computer.  Super easy to program on any OS.,Baofeng,cwekqq2,2,t5_2xg76
5566721,0,t1_cwmzzio,gt The ARRL conducted the tests I would think they know what theyre doing.Thats not how you science. Science is done by taking multiple independent tests and verifying the results among each other. So far weve got a report in QRZ at a hamfest saying Baofengs suck and their owners should feel bad weve got a dutch ham saying theres something funny about the results people are seeing with a reasonable explanation. Hell even Agilents own documentation says you need to pick an attenuator and also adjust for it accordingly!.gt While that has been brought up I still trust the majority of results that state the Baofengs are borderline at best. Out of the box yes. What else did you expect from a cheap Chineseproduced radio?gt When you put four or five different brands of radios on the same test...and most of them pass except the cheap units...then the only logical conclusion is the unit fails the test.Theres more reasons than that. Im not going to argue that the higher quality HTs probably have a better bandpass filter on them. A better bandpass filter would mask over the nonlinearity of the SA. It would also mask over poor choice in attenuator failure of appropriate configuration etc. I havent heard an RF engineer whos willing to put their iron ringEngineers ring down on their word say anything at this point. Neither have I heard anyone take the time to be a goddamn engineer and see if theres a reasonable solution for it. The filter network is a six or eight element network on both sides. Thats like a playground to work in. From what I can see the entire ham community has had a fantastically whiny failure to chooch on the subject. The UVR isnt the greatest radio in the world. Lets be honest with ourselves Its got a second harmonic thats right up there with the fundamental! But at . part can make it better in some respects. gt  Im getting sick of all the preppers pusingsic these radios while not pushing for anyone to get licensed.Different problem all together. I encourage people whore interested in radio experimentation  even with the Raspberry Pi which has harmonics coming out the honker  to get licensed. Im sick of the licensed hams with Extra class licenses going on about how shitty these new technicians are with their damn baofengs and not trying to fix the damn problem. I have been told by Extras that Im not worthy of having a license because Ive got a baofeng and not some highend k Yaesu or k ICOM that does everything including making coffee and walking the dog.Id love to get into the m and m stuff. Itd be a wonderful expedition into a section of the world that I dont get to touch much because Im a cheap bastard college student. ,Baofeng,cwn3pcl,3,t5_2xg76
5622879,0,t1_cwtro4m,My understanding for what Im trying to do is that I need both the transmitreceive frequency and tone in order for another radio to open up and hear me. So for example here is one of the frequencies Im trying to program in.Receive .Receive tone.Transmit .Transmit toneDPL Offset .,Baofeng,cwu2l8v,1,t5_2xg76
6058715,0,t1_cydjvws,any of the   cm extended whip antennas are going to perform about the same and give you considerable gain relative to the stock antenna.,Baofeng,cydskrd,2,t5_2xg76
6125034,0,t1_cylaow3,No error messages at all. No response. Nothing.However I did find the CHIRP config folder that was hidden. Deleted the chirp config file the app started right now. ,Baofeng,cylupcw,1,t5_2xg76
6589236,0,t1_d00uvxm,Let me know if you do it better   I just came up with this on the fly.  The only part I didnt like is my power strip didnt come apart easily I had to glue it back to make it secure.  Ive banged on it to make sure its not coming apart but still dont like it.  But it was the only way to get it secure onto the board that I could come up with.Theyre great little radios battery life is good you can get em for pc on Amazon.  Cant beat it.,Baofeng,d00vpx5,1,t5_2xg76
6733224,0,t3_47dvvo,Did you program the radios via PC or by hand?  If by PC reprogram the oddball again.  Otherwise do a reset on it look in the manualonline etc and see if that helps.,Baofeng,d0frvoc,1,t5_2xg76
7135161,0,t1_d1kl4je,Depends on how you use the handheld. For strict mcm yes they could be redundant but when you have extra RX in there as well they suddenly become VERY handy.,Baofeng,d1p6tjh,1,t5_2xg76
7320565,0,t1_d29il2y,Ay that worked out fine but some of the codes from the motorola talkie does not get scanned by the UVr I wonder why. Ohwell at least it works now thanks man ,Baofeng,d2aaqc8,1,t5_2xg76
8812986,0,t1_d74v2of,I need to get my Extra ticket I am really liking HF but I do more listening than anything. City ordinances prevent me from building a proper HF antenna tower that would be worth its salt to transmit on. I have VHF and UHF analog and digital capable on a  foot Rohn but I really have nothing to say to the local hams in fact my radios for that are mainly set up for my commercial repeaters to monitor customer traffic.,Baofeng,d77790z,1,t5_2xg76
8976713,0,t1_d7qmmjq,Do you think it would be possible to get a UART bluetooth module in there for programming without the cable? maybe even automate it so the phone can change the channel of the radio?,Baofeng,d7qv537,1,t5_2xg76
9925866,0,t1_daxxbsy,People getting out  miles on a HT are doing so to mountain top or hill top repeaters. Line of sight is much easier when at least one of the parties is at a significantly higher altitude.  miles is about right for flat terrain. ,Baofeng,db1d5tt,1,t5_2xg76
11403173,0,t3_62qhzl,No.  Your Baofeng doesnt understand the signal modulation or have nearly enough bandwidth to receive the entire signal.,Baofeng,dfoja6r,2,t5_2xg76
11445781,0,t1_dftbkfi,Yes more bands,Baofeng,dftdatx,1,t5_2xg76
