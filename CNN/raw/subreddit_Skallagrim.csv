3841287,0,t3_33zs1e,Have you ever been able to hold a German dueling shield?Heres a thought that perhaps not a lot of people have raised is I find it fairly peculiar that the dueling shield has a vertical shaft that runs the length of the shield. Of course this informs the way it is used but I dont see it in European martial arts usually. Most of the time youd see it in Zulu warrior shields or other types of ancient leather shieldsIs that observant correct or am I just not very well informed?,Skallagrim,cqu52hl,2,t5_32ted
