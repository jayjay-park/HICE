1985285,0,t3_2hgcxl,Also interested in this discussion dont have a definite answer but thought Id share my initial impressionsIve only beat the game with the Vaulters so far.  My build order usually depends on what my FIDS looks like after I settle.  If im heavy food I dont worry about seed storage right away.  I usually focus production tech first then food then dust then science.  I try and build my first settler after I build my first burrough so the pop will regain faster.  Its a bit slower to grab territory but I feel its safer.Basically I think a build order will be very dynamic however the tech order will be the one that guides it.,EndlessLegend,cksfe3s,5,t5_30xqz

2124724,0,t1_cl9qbn8,Building things researching technology and upgrading my cities has always been more fun to me than winning battles.  This is especially true if my opponent doesnt defend itself as is the case here.  So far wars consist of marching to a city autoresolving the steamroll battle against the  militia present then moving on.  If Im lucky I might stumble upon an army and fight an actual tactical battle.  Hopefully the AI patch will make combat a bit more interesting because right now theres not much to it.  If I want to play a wargame I have an assortment of Total War titles in addition to Starcraft  available.  If I want to play a X game Id like to have a chance to play a peaceful or purely defensive strategy.  This is possible in many other X titles which is why I find it disappointing here.  To be honest the number of X games with good combat is fairly low.  I enjoyed MOOs tactical battles and Civ V finally did away with stacks but aside from them X combat is often onedimensional.  Fortunately I like the other aspects quite a bit and the genre remains entertaining.,EndlessLegend,cl9wdiv,0,t5_30xqz

2750278,0,t3_2rk2s3,I dont find specialization that useful.  My science is never so advanced of my industry that I have any actual choices.  Every once in a while if I need a bit of science to get to the next tier Ill switch some pop in the city where it provides the most benefit usually a city conquered from the AI and put a titanium tome on a hero there.  And if I have the choice to buyout one building or another sometimes I prefer the buyout in the more developed city because those Dust improvements can really feedback into each other.Industry is something wonderful for every city in the first three tiers.  Dust is wonderful for every city in the last three tiers.  Science and food mostly take care of themselves with a moderate investment.My starting hero is military zero ambiguity.  I might not purchase a second.  That science boost  AM hero is a good buy as is that influence boost  Cultist.  I might buy a second general in which case ranged heroes are the most effective amazing skill tree.  If I decide to pursue a nonmilitary victory Ill probably pursue an economic one and dust boost or dust efficiency are both useful but really only at the top tiers.  Pursuing an economic victory means putting every city on dust duty.  Since Im more concerned with military upgrades in the early game Im not usually buying governors until tier  if at all at which point industry means much less so I dont bother with all those industry heroes that so many players swear up and down by.  If its a military game the best use of my dust is keeping my units in the latest fashions not investing in governors.,EndlessLegend,cngp155,4,t5_30xqz

Id love a naval aquaticthemed faction that doesnt necessarily build on top of water tiles too messy probably but can exploit them more than anyone and is perhaps best suited for dominating the oceans militarily economically with whatever new mechanics are introduced in the expansion. Some sort of amphibious faction that is best when founding cities on or near coastlines and decent when founding them on rivers maybe. If it was done at least as well as the stealth espionage stuff in Shadows Id be super happy.

Ive not done math on this one but buying the whole bundle would probably be cheaper than nitpicking the three big xpacs. There are three big expansions.Guardians gives you competitive deeds the first guy to defeat  armies gets a bonus etc as well as the titular guardians who are lategame megaunits. The latter are optional but fun like superweapons in other games the former are pretty integral to the game. Mustbuy.Shadows adds espionage and a faction that is built on it. The faction is VERY different gameplay wise from all the others. Espionage is as always with X games spy on people steal their tech sabotage them. A lot more options than usual though. This is  optional content and you can skip it if you want to.Shifters expands winters. Winter is like half the game and it turns from boring time where i cant explore or build well into a phase where you actually do unique things. This is the most integral expansion. Thats not counting the race which builds tall rather than wide unusual for EL and built on heavy scouting and exploiting winters very hard.Other DLCs are optional content and you can skip them if you want to.,EndlessLegend,d4wymyo,4,t5_30xqz

9348063,0,t3_589tpu,A good starting build order is founders memorial settler mill foundry settler.A good starting tech order is language square mill foundry empire mint seed storage public library.I think the most important thing to remind a beginner is to not neglect an army. Its really easy to get caught up building buildings but having a standing army is always more important.  Your units need to be customized every era.  If you neglect this you are going to be real confused when your massive army falls to pieces.  Or even worse when a roaming army quest shows up and takes your capital.  You need armies for more than just war.  They scout they collect ruins quests and pearls and they complete quests.  In a general sense when you start the game your goals are going to vary army by faction but for the most part when you start you should be focusing on scouting and settling.  Have your scouts collect quests and if you can accomplish some that should be where you settle.  Having the extra  pop early is huge for starting these cities.  Try not to reach era  before you have built  settlers because the cost goes up with the era.  Build all the non tile based era  buildings in each city.  Dont research the era  weapons and armor they get outclassed too quickly. Era  weapons are great though. Focus on food and production early and switch to dust and influence in the mid game.,EndlessLegend,d90xndh,2,t5_30xqz

9523557,0,t1_d9242hi,Kinda late to the party here in fact I just made a reddit account specifically to respond but is it even possible to dissent cultist indoctrinated villages? It seemed I wasnt able to do so in a game that I ran recently... But yeah I second the use of dissent for virtually every other faction. However might I also point out how effective this is when paired with an embedded spy who can wipe out fortifications at a target city? Spying on any major factions city also gives you vision of their pacifiedassimilated villages. This means you can use dissent on all the visible nearby minor faction villages and catspaw all the resultant roaming armies to attack their city which now has zero fortifications. If you actually want to take their city then just remember to bring along a small contingent of masterminds they are cheap as dirt to produce anyways. Its even better doing this with a proper network of spies across multiple cities! Just imagine the unstoppable and extremely sudden wave of catspawed minor factions attacking a whole bunch of entirely unfortified cities! Also given that Morgawr heroes can make decent spies I found it was still reasonably effective to use them when I couldnt get Forgotten. Naturally there are some drawbacks. First this works best on the newer cities produced by a given faction since on average most starting regions seem to lack more than  minor faction village and in my admittedly limited experience AI enemy factions tend to just start in the first region they come across. Furthermore depending on the scale of your planned attack this approach does take some time prepare. For starters you will need to be focusing on leveling up individual spies to infiltration level  AND have decent dust and influence production to be able to afford all the resultant dissentcatspawsupkeep costs. but I feel that at least in AI games the results are hilarious and absolutely worth it. Finally unless the cultists faction you come across is averse to converting villages you basically have no means whatsoever to turning their villages against them. What I usually do is just black spot them and let their enemies and any allies I have wipe them out. Also remember that if you attack a city with ONLY catspaw units you will raze the city as opposed to taking it as your own. This means you lose out on any buildings and improvements the targeted faction constructed in that region. This can be a good thing however if you want to resettle the region and move your city center into a different part of the region. For the morgawr being along the cost is for the best and so it can actually make sense to raze a city that is landlocked.ALSO WHY IS THERE NO MENTION OF BLACK SPOT GUYS???!!! Its amazing to be able to attack a faction without declaring actual war on them and also get paid for attacking said faction. Plus you can use black spot as a bargaining chip during negotiations too either with the victim of the black spot or any allies you happen to have. My final tip is use black spot religiously if you can. The additional dust production will help quite a bit in early game provided you are recruiting minor factions to help kill your enemies. ,EndlessLegend,d9mzasg,2,t5_30xqz

9822886,0,t1_danxkox,I was mostly asking for diplomacy to make use of the Skyfins in their territories since even on Hard the AIs were attacking them on sight. At the same time as I received a message from the Vaulters saying they were tolerating the Skyfin they attacked it and I had to retreat. With Peace they literally cant attack so that means free roaming for the Skyfins.  But yeah I guess overpreparing militarily is probably a better play in the end. A bit sad that being a warmonger is often the best solution  even as Roving Clans Im generally happy that someone declares war on me because it means free land eventually.Thanks again for the infos!,EndlessLegend,danxxek,1,t5_30xqz
9866168,0,t3_5gnetg, I think the Guardians expansion really helps the Cultists so I would add that at least. The reason is that all of the Once in your empire buildings are added by it from what I know and obviously as Cultists the drawback of those buildings like Dust Transmuter and Canal Locks is irrelevant.   You cannot convert nonpacified villages the option will always be greyed out that it even appears if the village isnt pacified is admittedly a bit confusing. As the Cultists you usually want to pacify through quests and not through violence as destroyed villages cost more to convert and also Preachers are possibly the worst fighters in the game. In the beginning of every Cultists game you want to immediately split up your army and start exploring and talking to every single village. and search ruins of course Eventually youll get one of the easy quests such as Make sure theres no enemy in  turns. Even Too Many Chiefs the one that starts by giving  dust is okay to try. Destroying the villages is your last resort.,EndlessLegend,datl1tr,7,t5_30xqz

10558563,0,t1_dd4wgq2,So the main thing for you is probably expansion disapproval  Every new borough gives you  happiness. Once you level it up it gives  happiness which sums up to  net happiness from that specific borough. You HAVE to build them so they can level up and give you more hapiness. This is done by having four other boroughs city center and any other expansion you build count too touch that specific borough. Because of that the most efficient city layout is a double line triangle or variations of triangle hourglass diamond you can look it up on google. The point is as much of your boroughs must be level .Also each era has a happiness building research or decreasing expansion disapproval research. This helps.  If you have all the DLC being the first to gather  of any luxury resources completes the era I legendary deed and gives you  wine. It boosts happiness real hard and helps a lot early game.,EndlessLegend,dd4xkvc,2,t5_30xqz

10712443,0,t1_ddgkjgc,gt the RC are good against ForgottenId say in that fight good is an understatement. Keep a Forgotten market banned and it might as well be game over for them. They dont have the strength to hold a ton of cities directly against pretty much any faction and without enough spies they cant cause enough disruption to get not steamrolled. ,EndlessLegend,ddkwpo3,1,t5_30xqz
