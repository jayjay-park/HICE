It was the methods of rigorous thinking and analysis that were useful. So no matter what you do after college I believe that youll do just fine in any sort of job that requires rigorous analytic capabilities. And while youre trying to sort it all out there are things like the Peace Corps and Teach for America that could almost certainly use your knowledge and skills.Since  Ive come to see that my views about grad school were slightly off back then. At the time I considered grad school to be nothing other than a path to academia and the a PhD was the only goal worth pursuing. Ive come to realize that an MS in Math or Statistics or Logic offers quite a range of career options. Cryptography comes immediately to mind at one point I worked in the same building as a bunch of cryptographers and many of them has studied Math and formal Logic. Or something in the actuarial field. Or programming.Anyway just continue on doing what you enjoy doing...keep your eyes and ears open and an open mind...and Im sure youll find a career path that works for you.,mathematics,cibh0ci,1,t5_2qjc8
1367765,0,t3_29q9dc,For Frege complete generality was a key part of logic so his logical system was designed to be completely general. For that reason his system reduced math not to a theory of sets but a theory of concepts and their extensions concepts are what is denoted by a phrase like is blue or was born before Frege while the extension of a concept is the collection of all objects for which a given concept is true. Russells paradox demonstrated that Freges system was inconsistent which made it unsuitable as a foundation for mathematics.In response mathematicians came up with an alternative foundation for mathematics called Zermelo Fraenkel set theory or ZF. To the best of our knowledge ZF is consistent but it seems to lack the full generality that is a hallmark of logic. Here are two reasons ZF makes statements about the existence of objects without compelling justification by the rules of thought e.g. the axiom of infinity.  ZF is a theory of sets and not a theory of concepts like Freges original system was. In Freges system each concept regardless of whether it was a concept of math or something else had an extension. But in ZF there are concepts that have no corresponding set. This was done in an effort to avoid contradictory objects like the set of all sets that do not contain themselves that was constructed by Russell but had the effect of also prohibiting the construction of other seemingly innocuous sets. For example there is no set of all sets though there is a class of all sets. These seemingly arbitrary restrictions on what sets did and did not exist have compelling mathematical justification but lack the generality requisite to be considered logical.If youre interested in reading about the foundations of math and already know the basics of logic and naive set theory I recommend Philosophies of MathematicsEdit your gt youreEdit  Fixed error caught by ufractalshark,mathematics,cinqkzn,13,t5_2qjc8

2164056,0,t1_cleaiuw,gtthe relative velocities of the front and back of a train are not constant to the observer.This isnt true. If the train is moving in an inertial frame then the observed velocities of the start and end of the train are constant. The relative velocity between them is then a function of two constant velocities and must therefore also be constant. To get around this logic the way you add velocities needs to be dependent on where those velocities are located relative to you andor each other. The doppler effect does what it does because the waves that hit you are being emitted in different directions at different points in the trains path. The velocity of the source compared to you is constant over time and over the length of the train.Im not really sure what you mean by real rather than the doppler effect.

2693767,0,t3_2quog3,A major theme in mathematics is the investigation into the properties of an object which are intrinsic to that object. When we say a property is intrinsic we mean the property will hold regardless of how we represent the object. In arithmetic the sum of digits is not an intrinsic property of a number the number  has digits which sum to  but in binary  is  written  whose sum is . Which number base we use changes the sum of the digits so its not intrinsic.On the other hand whether or not a number is prime does not depend on the base. The number  is composite regardless of whether we look at it in decimal or in base .So lets look at your problem. In linear algebra the primary objects of study are vectorspaces and linear transformations between them. We can represent the same vectorspace several different ways Each basis gives us a different way to look at the space. What invariants are there in linear algebra? Perhaps the most important is the dimension of a vectorspace. No matter what basis we use different bases will have the same cardinality. We call this cardinality the dimension of the space.What about linear maps? Well these guys are a bit trickier. Between two vectorspaces a linear map can be represented as a matrix. But the entries in the matrix depend on the choice of basis for the domain and codomain. Changing your representation will change the entries in the matrix!Luckily people have worked out a very rich theory for us. But lets narrow down that question a little more. Instead of a general linear transformation which goes from one vectorspace to another lets work with a linear opeartor. A linear operator is a linear transformation from a vectorspace to itself. This means we only have one basis to work with not two. It also means we can compare the vectors we input into the operator with what outputs we get out of it.One interesting fact you can work out is this If I shove an entire subspace through the operator then I get a subspace back. By the ranknullity theorem the subspace that comes out must have equal or lesser dimension than what I put in. So a natural question I could ask is this if I shove a subspace through my operator is the result contained entirely within that subspace?Such a subspace is called an invariant subspace. Its pretty easy to see that the whole space and the zero subspace are always invariant. For some spaces these are the only invariant subspaces. A rotation by  degrees in R sends any dimensional subspace a line through the origin to a different dimensional subspace a different line. Other operators are more interesting a rotation of  degrees in the xy plane in R has the xy plane itself a as an invariant subspace as well as the zaxis a dimensional subspace.So what is this eigencrap? Eigenvectors are how we study invariant subspaces. If we can find an eigenvector of a linear operator we have found a dimensional invariant subspace the span of that vector is invariant.One particularly nice situation is given like this if we are very lucky it may turn out that we have a basis of the space consisting of eigenvectors. Such a basis is called an eigenbasis and it makes things much easier to calculate. For a vector x y z in the eigenbasis if T is our operator then Txyz   x  y  z where   and  are the corresponding eigenvalues. No matrix multiplication is required.

Now it is possible to ask a computer to output many many solutions and this may be done using whichever programming language youd like    currently we know this holds for the first  zeros However this is not sufficient to prove the Reimann Hypothesis.
