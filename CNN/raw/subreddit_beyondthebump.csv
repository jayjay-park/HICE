Recaro isnt available in Canada so Ive never had the opportunity to play with them.When youre ready to move up to a convertible the narrowest long lasting seats on the market right now are the Diono Radians and Clek Foonf.  There will be new seats on the market this spring that may work as well.Best bet is to find a store that will let you try different seats in your car beside the Recaros.

111892,0,t3_1vdhbw,Dog psychologyThe family unit is their pack and to your dog you live within a VERY strict social order Your husband is probably what your dog considers the alpha he is head of the pack because he has been around the longest and is the original disciplinarian. You are second in command clearly ranking above the dog  because you established your dominance over the dog probably physically awhile ago and are supported by the alpha. If you or your husband sneak up on the dog and startle him he will forgive youyou are his superiors after all.A baby is the equivalent of a puppy its new to the scene small and weak and cant establish dominance over the dog. Therefore if the dog has been around longer than the baby the dog will believe the baby is the new bottom rung in the pack hierarchy. All new members to the pack start at the bottom thats just how it is to your dog!Annoying the dog by doing things like sneaking up on him pulling his tail etc all innocent things a baby might do are cause for the dog to snap at the baby as he would a puppy essentially to put the inferior back in its place and to teach the puppy show some respect to its superiors. This is how puppies learn pack hierarchy and there is no reason for your dog to think your baby wouldnt be the same way. Its terrifying to watch a dog snap at a child however most of the time provided they understand the child is part of the pack they never actually break the skin. The behavior is designed to scare the child. Its how a dog disciplines pups.I would do a little research on dog dominance and babies or new babies to see what advice is out there.,beyondthebump,cer66tg,3,t5_2u06v

With the gift receipt I could just put it aside and take it back after the baby was born  or open it up and use it.Also when you go to visit her after the baby is born call first and see if you can pick anything up for her.

Pardon my language but fuck everyone elses opinions on how you choose to parent.My older daughter now . years old slept on my chest for nearly every nap until she was about  months old.  Then she got to the point where she was not sleeping as well with that arrangement so she started napping on a makeshift bed in the living room while I readwatched TVknitted.  She moved up to napping in the bed room when she was a bit older and needed a bit more quiet and solitude.  She slept in a sidecar crib until she was  months then slept on a mattress at the foot of our bed until after her second birthday.  She asked for her own room and has been in there ever since.  We laid down with her until she fell asleep for naps and bedtimes for  monthsish.  She rarely asks for us to stay with her at night.  She doesnt nap during the day but she happily plays independently in her room while her sister naps now.My almost  year old napped on me until about  months.  She was in a sidecar crib for the same amount of time.  Then she got moved to a packnplay next to our bed for naps and nights nights because she was pulling my hair and naps because C needed more time with me oneonone during the day.  We moved her to a mattress next to our bed around  months when she climbed out of the packnplay.  We moved her into her own room a few weeks ago.  She often needs us to sit with her when shes falling asleep and often comes into our room in the middle of the night.  She just needs a bit more nighttime parenting than her sister did at her age.  Shes very independent....fiercely independent.I rarely have showers that dont involve at least one child in there with me.  Once they were sitting theyd either be playing on the floor outside of the tub while I played peekaboo behind the curtain or theyd be sitting in the tub with a few toys or a wash cloth.There are a few phases of separation anxiety.

If they go in the potty just point out what is happening  look! you are peeing in the potty! your pee went in the potty! or poop or whatever. So they get to know what happens.

His only lasted two weeks and ended right on the day he was able to roll over from back to front but boy it felt a lot longer than that.  Just as luck would have it the twoweek period coincided with the worst two weeks at work so I was almost going crazy from the lack of sleep.The one thing that helped us get through the sleep regression in one piece is the agreement to take shifts.  I would take the pm  am shift the husband would take the am  am shift.  This way we were able to at least get solid uninterrupted sleep even though the timing isnt exactly ideal beggars cant be choosers!.  Too bad we didnt figure this out until a few days before it ended but at least we know what to do the next time he goes through the same thing apparently there will be similar regressions at  months  months  months and  months.

He has started sleeping longer there before he wakes up and starts fussing and I am settling him and leaving him in his crib more times per night than previously.Example When I first transitioned him he would start fussing about  minutes after I put him down and I would immediately bring him back to bed with us. Now he goes about  hours before he starts fussing and I will settle him back in his crib  or  times before I finally bring him back.

I make his own purees and freeze them in ice cube trays. Right now at each meal hes getting three ice cubes which is about oz. Sometimes he fusses the whole meal but keeps opening his mouth so I keep feeding him. Its confusing I usually stop feeding him when he escalates his fussing andor stops opening his mouth. Ive been giving him Cheerios at each meal which he loves. Last night I gave him some steamed sweet potato and he basically just mushed it all over the tray. I also boob on a schedule which ends up  timesday  times at night  were working on that I also give him a straw cup with water in it at all meals which he sucks on while I heat up his cubes.I think in terms of volume youre doing it right  let him dictate how much to feed him.

561355,0,t3_20jsto,My mom has been a huge emotional let down if not drag for me my entire life. She gave me up to my grand parents for the first several years of my life. She failed and several times refused to protect me from abuse when I was a child even when I begged her to. She coddled and enabled and lied for my drug addict brain injured younger brother to the point that she has helped nearly kill him. She and I have had so many issues that I tried to move past and was able to compartmentalize for quite a while because I wanted a relationship with her. However...I tried for  years to get pregnant and for that entire time and throughout my pregnancy my mom promised she would come stay with me for several weeks and be there to help me when the baby was born. I know I was a fool to think that would happen given our past but I thought she would care enough about my baby not to let me down. She left after staying only  days. This stirred up so many bad feelings and memories. Every time I looked at my daughter I could not understand how my own mother could have left me with someone else to take care of me. When my baby cried I couldnt understand how my mom could have left me in a room to scream myself to sleep as a newborn a tactic she was still currently encouraging me to use with my daughter.  I shed many tears thinking about why my own mom didnt love me like I love my daughter. I really dont think our relationship will ever recover.

The night before I sat in my master bathroom and cried ugly tears for over an hour mourning the end of my maternity leave and how much I wished I was in a position to be able to make something else work not SAHM for me but my work situation isnt ideal due to a very long commute.  Alas off to daycare she went.Im three weeks in now and aside from the case of the sniffles she seems to have contracted I feel like my daughter is doing marvelous.  Im lucky enough to have been able to stop by and check in on her a few times and each day I felt reassured by what I saw.I think the biggest thing I had to overcome was the realization that no matter how picky you are you do give up control when you are not a SAHP and that is difficult.  I dont love that my LO is in the hands of someone else meaning she will watch more TV than Id like or play with musical toys or eat things I wouldnt probably feed her on the regular... but Ive come to accept that she will be okay regardless.  Shes loved on at daycare shes loved on at home and that is going to have to be enough.I definitely look forward every single day to seeing her smiling face though.  And I am sad to leave her every Monday... but it IS okay and it DOES get better.  EDIT I just wanted to say that my post isnt to mean that I dont have days when I struggle with having her in daycare.  I do on a regular basis.

There are soo many different techniques to getting gas out  but the one I generally use is hold him upright supporting his neck and gently but still rather firmly pat his back starting low and working your way upwards for about  minutes.If all else fails call in the midwifenurse  they can give you some great calming techniques show you other burping techniques check how bub is latching when feeding etc. Even just hearing an explanation on what is going on can help...

I was so exhausted I was dizzy and not able to walk very well. My lack of sleep kinda turned into an emergency.Our doctor suggested Gerber probiotic drops and they seemed to have helped. I also supplement with formula because of low milk supply and we use Gerber sooth which also has probiotics. We also give her mylicon sp? gas drops with every feed. Ive also read that the Woombie houdini swaddle works well for poor sleepers and fussy babies. That came in the mail today so will try it out tonight. The big change is that we started putting her to sleep in the swing and she sleeps much better. She does wake up and fuss when she farts but then the motion of the swing lulls her back to sleep. I was really reluctant to let her sleep in the swing too but my exhaustion was getting critical. I was  so afraid I would stumble and drop her. I sleep on the couch right next to the swing so Im close. Weve been doing this for about a week and its working well. Im feeling much more rested. Can you ask your SO or a family memberfriend to take over  nights a week so you can get some sleep? Or could someone watch him during the day so you can sleep?

Id tried making the bottle in the first wakeup bigger but it didnt change the subsequent wakeup times. I think that clued me in to the fact that it wasnt actually hunger but more so that he was just used to waking up at those times. I also knew he was capable of sleeping through because he slept through the night from  months until his  month regression. It didnt improve with more gentle methods or nocry methods and by  months he was waking up  times a night. With all of those factors in mind and based on his personality very stubborn and sturdy but okay with change and easygoing we went with Ferber  s progressive waiting approach and started it last night. He only woke up twice near the beginning of the night and slept until am! He had a bottle first thing in the morning no bigger than usual and is playing in front of me right now as if nothing happened! Every baby is SO different and so is every mom and dad. Some have the infinite patience and ability to go without sleep for years. Bless them and all the power to them if they want to or need to do that.

You obviously care about giving your child the best care. Making the choice to stop breastfeeding was an appropriate choice for you because your baby deserves a happy mommy not one that is miserable and resentful. And you deserve to care for your child in a way that doesnt put undue burden on you. You didnt fail anything. You simply made an adaptation around something that didnt work for you two.

Im considering switching to formula so that anyone can feed her. There are many healthy people who had formula as a baby. Also things with the SO ask or tell him what you want. It still pisses me off that mine cant figure it out either but it really makes life better if you get him to take some things on. So pick something and ask for it.

1095349,0,t3_26kohu,My middle child was like that half the time he wouldnt even let me sit down while I was holding him!  A few things to consider  prop your elbows up with pillows while youre in the recliner so you dont have to bear weight on your arms.  If you get it just right you may find you can sleep this way as well.    bring baby in bed with you take precautions with your bedding of course know the risks and decide whether this is a possibility with your sleep style first.  baby wearing for when youre awake I personally love the moby or a knockoff since you can go totally hands free with it.  tight swaddle can give the feeling of being held some babies really need to be straight jacket swaddled in either a secure swaddlesack or blanket.  You mentioned in a comment that youre having some trouble due to the heat try using something like a beach sarong to swaddle instead of a receiving blanket.  They breath and generally feel nice against the skin when its hot they also make the best nursing covers when its hot out.  Her hating it does not mean it wont work she may just be fighting extra hard against that sleepy feeling.  call in all the reinforcements  dont be afraid to ask someone to come hold the baby so you can sleep take any and all help people will give you.  Worst case scenario theyll shit on you for it.  Honestly there is a point of tired its usually before Im so tired Im vomiting for me but youll find it for yourself where the disapproval of others really loses its power so if you can get someone to bail you out just go for it and start asking all the people for help.  make sure youre swapping out your position dont hold her with the same arm all the time trade sides in the recliner use something to support your arms every time,beyondthebump,chssn54,1,t5_2u06v

Would you consider cutting off the ear lobes from children mutilation? Modern medicine cures infections with antibiotics this is not the Middle Ages and its not gangrene... Girls are  times more prone to UTIs than boys and thankfully nobody suggests cutting anything from them. Why? Because its mutilation no matter how little you intend to remove it still qualifies as such from a legal standpoint. Boys are not born with extra body parts its a culturalreligious bias that started  Religiously In the Old Testament as a blood sacrifice  right after God asked Abraham to murder his child and he agreed !...Then he said hed just take some of his penis. yo ABraham then proceeded to slice off all the men around him including his slaves.... Culturally in the US in the th century to cure masturbatory insanity and epilepsy among other things its a punitive surgery that stemmed from puritanical views on sexuality in the Victorian Era where sexual pleasure was perceived as bad.

This does not mean it is safe to use it on the shopping cart. One big risk of doing so is that the cart can overbalance. Another big issue is that using the seat on the cart can actually damage the locking mechanism for the car base. Please check your manual and see if it specifically says that it can be used on shopping carts.

It wasnt as hard as I thought it would be. I was also super busy at work everything was right where I left it  months ago lol so that made my days go by faster.

If you google car seat alarm there are several article that show up such as this one this one and this one. Also there are methods that you can use to help you remember. For example any time that you have the baby with you you put your pursewallet in the back seat with the baby andor you put your diaper bag in the front seat. Those things help you remember that you have the baby.

1433193,0,t3_2ajyez,Honestly if you want to give the campingout thing a try its likely to take longer than  minutes. That said it wasnt right for us and I could tell pretty quickly when she cried whether or not shed settle in a reasonable amount of time. I also hear starting with naptimes is tough for things like that.We put ours on a floor mattress about that time. Wed already broken the nursingtosleep association at night but it took some extra work for it to be at naptime too. First I moved naptime into the bedroom on her floor mattress. Once she was used to that I started leaving after she was asleep. Shed wake up after  minutes and then Id go in and lay with her again the rest of the nap. Then I started leaving again after that first wakeup. At around that time she started sleeping for  minutes occasionally and so Id only have to go in again for the last . Basically I kept this up until she got used enough to me leaving that shed go back to sleep when I wasnt there. Somewhat concurrently I stopped actually laying down with her and instead sat on the floor beside her initially with my head by hers and patting and rubbing her back and shushing. I tapered those off until I was just sitting and shushing then standing at the door and shushing etc. We were working on the same thing at night at about the same time again. She would go to sleep in her own bed and then crawl in with us when she woke up. Eventually I only needed to stay till she had her eyes closed and then slip out. The whole process took several months and it might vary a bit with yours ours is a Velcro but I dont know any way to keep things gentle that doesnt take a lot of time and patience or we would have done it that way! Even with this there were some angry tears when I changed something. I think she consistently took naps on her own the whole time at about  months. Now at  months I can lay her down fully awake and walk out of the room all in about  seconds and return  hours later to a calm Mama? Mama? Not every day but many.,beyondthebump,civxeej,4,t5_2u06v

She sees her BFF bailing last minute on her milestone birthday and you not being there for her. Its difficult for her to put herself in your shoes if she doesnt have a child it really does change things.

I remember sitting at my desk and not being able to write anything.  I think it was then that I realized that I had nothing to say to someone that I knew didnt care about me.  He never called never sent cards never asked to see me.  EVER.  He paid wk in child support and that was it.He died a few weeks before I turned .  I knew that I had a half sister who was over  years my senior.  Unfortunately she didnt know she had a half sister.  We found this out through the attorney handling his estate.  My dad was such a heartless jackass that he never told ANYONE I existed.  I was never more glad in my life that I never knew him.  Clearly he was glad to have never known me.Looking back I think that honesty is the best policy here.  My mom never said anything mean or negative about him to me.  She told me the truth and let me do with that information what I wanted.  Im really grateful that despite my young age she trusted that I could process and handle that knowledge.

1629113,0,t3_2cybbu,I was gonna get a throwaway to say this but whatever. Ive been where you are and even though our caseworker assured us every step of the way that he knew we didnt cause the two pencil eraser sized bruises on my  month old daughters cheek on purpose the fact that we didnt have an explanation for them meant the doc saying it typically means abuse was enough to keep our investigation open for  months. The fact that my husband is a stay at home dad heightened their suspicion because people still assume men cant be good caregivers. Initially our daughter was taken from us and placed in foster care for two nights because of the safety plan and we dont live near family who could take her. Worst weekend of my life until judge placed her back in our care Monday. The caseworker even told us the case had been traumatic for him because he knew we were innocent but CPS cant just dismiss cases when docs say inflicted injury. They finally dismissed after he fought for us and now we are in the process of getting everything expunged. It would have never taken  months if we had hired an attorney to fight them and force them to move our case along. Cases like ours arent high priority because they know the kid is safe but cant just drop it. Its horrible. GET AN ATTORNEY. I know they are expensive. I know we all cant afford it. I am convinced we would have been done months ago if we had. The new state of CPS assumes every parent is an abuser because there are soooo many assholes hurting kids today. I now refuse to take my  month old out in public anytime she bumps her head crawling and gets a bruise or sleeps on her cheek and it ends up red for awhile. Im terrified of toddling because I know she will hurt herself occasionally and part of me thinks someone will rip her from my arms again. GET AN ATTORNEY,beyondthebump,cjkij8x,4,t5_2u06v

Changing a baby in an airplane bathroom without one is baby origami. We only changed because poop otherwise Id just have waited. Temperature is a little unpredictable bring a blankie muslin swaddle blankie was perfect. If youre nursing a travel pillow or travel nursing pillow can be super helpful also a place to set their bum or let them nap. I tried nursing on takeofflanding but mixed results. She didnt seem to complain about her ears and just wanted to be hungry when she was normally hungry. She slept when shed normally sleep. Remember that you are much more aware of their cries and behavior than other people. We thought her few minutes of crying was super annoying but people around us didnt even notice and we were in first class for at least one leg. We brought jammies and changed her between legs of our journey you could also do it before or may not need it depending on time of day youre flying.

When he was  months we moved to a house that had a weird changing table sized alcove in the bathrrom previous owners had a armed chair there. We put the change table there and never turned back. The diaper genie holds the smell well but sometimes it still can stink. Its nice to have the sink right there to wash my hands too.

Keeping it moisturized is the key for me. I also found sleeping in a swaddle blanket works because shes not rubbing at her face all night. It is usually much less severe after a day or two of this and usually gone after  days.

My LO hated having his arms swaddled and would grunt and squirm trying to free them.  How many layers is he in? Is it enough?  The kid may be a bit nippy so sleeping on you provides not just comfort but warmth.

Such is life. I keep trying to tell myself Im doing whats best for our family but I cant help but feel like Im getting cheated. I can only hope I will feel better about it with time.

2305111,0,t1_clwkas2, asshats. Just keep asking him to do stuff for the baby. Im lucky personally but I know fathers who have never changed a nappy. Talk to him. If hes ho hum about being involved in a fun way then just ask him to do things for the baby. Changebath etc. Oh... And organize a few hours a week to go out by yourself leaving him alone with bubba.

2305824,0,t3_2lo1ea,Next to food sleep is one of the most important things for a baby. Its when so much happens in their brain and literally when they grow. My LO started teething right around the same time and its been rough. I have read pretty much every article out there about getting them to sleep or staying asleep. Then the  month SR started.. and  month shots and I was LOSING MY MIND. so keeping in mind how utterly important sleep is and how scary a sleep deprived baby is I determined that for now using every trick in the book is worth it.  Bad habits can be dealt with later when baby isnt in painsicksleep regression etc. Ive also learned that when she starts to rouse in her crib if I get in there fast and pat her butt gently or hold her hand she typically will go back into a deeper sleep. And if you pay close attention you can learn their new sleep cycle and sort of predict when they will start to wake themselves up and you can intervene. Also where as before rocking or a pacifier helped PUT her to sleep now she seems to prefer just being put in her crib and tossing and turning for a minute. Anything else will often times keep her awake. She also wants to go to sleep earlier pm so hopefully that helps? So now after about  weeks of waking and fussing she is back to sleeping for about  hours nursing for a minute then back to sleep. All of this goes out the window though if she doesnt nap every  hours during the day..Have you tried begging? Sometimes I resort to begging her to go back to sleep. Like every other tip or trick sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt lol. This too shall pass hopefully soon,beyondthebump,clwpswn,1,t5_2u06v

2464251,0,t3_2npijj,I think that having children is what you make of it. There is no reason why you have to give up your interests or career over a child. Yes it may make things more difficult and you will have to choose what is more important. It is hard in the beginning but there is a point where you will start to feel like you again.My daughter is  weeks old and everything had gotten significantly better within the last month. Being a mom is not going to define who I am because Im much more than that. I still make time for myself. My husband is totally supportive of me taking time for myself and then he gets some one on one time with her. For me its taking my dog and going running. It is my one thing I have to do to keep myself sane. Im currently on maternity leave but going back to work on Monday. Honestly find the best daycare out there. It will make you feel better about leaving your child all day. I feel very comfortable with our daycare so it will be that much easier for me to focus on my career. My boss has basically told me that I will be promoted when I return to work so knowing that she is being taken care of during the day will make it easier on me to take the promotion it requires much more traveling out to job sites and slightly longer days than what Im currently doing. Also I think it is very common for women to worry about what you are concerned about. And you know what? Everything is going to be fine. Your child is not going to be ruined because you wanted a career or have interests that do not include himher. It will show them that they have a driven and strong mommy. You are not the first or the last mommy that has a career or interests. Things will be hectic at first because you will have to plan a little more but you will get through it.

Once in a while Ill offer something different to change it up like a scrambled egg or blanched spinach leaves. I offer the remaining milk sippy again after this meal if it wasnt finished or Ill refill it and offer another. Water is also offered.Afternoon snack around pm A Mum Mum and a toddler fruit leather with no added sugar or maybe some fruit or crackers. He isnt always hungry for this one if hes eaten a lot for lunch. I wil also offer water again afterward.Dinner around pm If what were eating isnt heavily seasoned or salty I try to give him some of what were having.

He usually will drink the whole sippy this time and may even drink a full oz if hes particularly wanting to. We also offer water again but no liquids after  as his bedtime is at pm and hes a heavy nighttime wetter.

2678092,0,t3_2qoe84,You sound exactly like me at that stage! I had no freaking idea what I was doing and kept hearing about sleep training and naps and all these things that sounded glorious. The fact is baby is still too young for any kind of schedule or training. They wake when theyre hungry sleep when theyre tired poop and pee and any given moment. You have to be flexible and roll with it right now. HOWEVER. I have managed to have a son who sleeps pretty damn easily whether by sheer dumb luck or by fluke training I dont know. I cant remember exactly what I did oh sleep deprivation but it included these things. Went back to swaddling. We tried swaddling him with his arms up or out and he slept like shit. I couldnt figure out what the hell the problem was until one day I just got fed up and wrapped him arms in. Worked like a bloody charm. At three months he is a Houdini and wakes himself up when he busts out of his swaddle but when we do swaddle him he protest cries for a moment as he is falling asleep. Its a beautiful thing.. I always put him down when he started getting sleepy. Sometimes it was hard because as a newborn hed fall asleep in an instant. And sometimes when we put him down or moved him he was instantly alert. But when his transitions to sleep grew longer I put him down drowsy. And yes this was right from infancy. I didnt intentionally not respond right away to his cries but sometimes it took longer to get to him. He knows that I am coming and trusts me and I know the difference between his fussing out of boredom or annoyance and his cries for pickupdiaperboobattention. Even now I dont respond to all of his cries because I can tell the difference when he actually needs me and when hes just mumbling in his sleep. He can put himself to sleep and I can now put him down awake and usually hell go to sleep pretty easily.Tricks to helping him learn to soothe himself to sleep firm hand pressure on his chest while shushing andor gently swinging him side to side. His bassinet mattress moves slightly. Not always picking him up when he cried. Stroking the skin between his eyes sometimes while shushing him. Putting arms against both sides of his body also sometimes while shushing him. Almost always a pacifier. Rockingswingingswaying. Pick upput down. It took several weeks of doing one some all of these methods interspersed with picking up to soothe but it eventually worked. I didnt want him to rely on my arms to get to sleep because I knew it wasnt sustainable. I knew when he really needed to be picked up and comforted and when he was just grumpy. Also we always went right back to him if we were trying to lull him to sleep we stepped away and he started crying againit taught him that we were there and would come back.. I didnt start actively initiating naps until about two months or bedtime until nearly three months. I let him tell me when he was sleepy so now I know what that looks like and what time he generally needs to sleep. He generally cant last longer than two hours awake so I know hell need a nap about then. His first awake period of the day lasts about . hours nearly every time. He needs bedtime about  but he sometimes goes to bed a little lateranytime between  is normal.. Sleep begets sleep. It stressed me out at first as people always said he wouldnt sleep at night if I let him sleep longer than three hours at a time during the day so Id wake him from naps if they went over three hours. Mistake. This did not help him. If your baby needs sleep let her sleep. . Mimic night and day environments. In the evening for several weeks we would turn off most of the lights quiet the rooms had minimal distractionsno bright lights toys TV music etc. and shut the blinds. When he woke we avoided eye contact made changes as fast as possible I nursed him usually to sleep and that was it. No play time nothing fun or interesting dim lights. In the day we made it bright and fun and interesting. This helps them sort out days and nights and it will help them sleep better at night later. Also! baby connect app is the best thing ever. I bought the full version and I use it all the time for tracking sleep nursing diapers medical issues etc. It is brilliant.

2872848,0,t1_cnumxbl,We had shockingly similar birth experiences. I fortunately knew twins would probably come early so I prepared the nursery and myself for the nicu. I just thought it would be a few days not a month. My SIL who lives on the same street as us had a baby  weeks before us and they went home the day after the birth. Completely problem free. Ive been avoiding her and her perpetually sick two year old because Im jealous of her lack of fertility problems lack of pregnancy problems and perfect birth as she would call it. I do feel robbed and I was always worried about something being wrong. I saw the lump but thought it was normal with having a penis and balls. Now I look back and think how could I be so dumb to have missed the giant lump of his intestines sticking out. Fortunately we were at the doctor within  hours of it appearing. Now Im probably going to be even more neurotic.  I had the same thought today about them staying at the hospital. I wish they were being looked after by professionals at times because I missed that huge symptom. I just knew he was off and screaming and hadnt pooped as much. Didnt think the giant lump had anything to do with it. I also miss sleeping. I love this guys but nothing has been what I expected since we decided to try to have kids.

The thing that really helped me from that was spending ten days keeping a sleep journal where you track when where and how long your baby sleeps each day. I was able to see my babys sleep patterns and do things to encourage longer better sleep. The key with a dream feed is that your baby has to have been asleep for a good  hour stretch and then you quietly sneak in already prepared to nurse. Pop the baby on let baby nurse for a few minutes and then only if baby is still sleepy or totally asleep you gently return the baby to the crib. I sneak a pacifier in too.

But youre doing everything right however he sleeps you do that. You cant spoil him and its completely normal for you to be feeling the way you are. Getting baby to sleep is still a massive trigger of anxiety for me even at  months!When he is awake if you get a chance do some tummy time with him. Even if thats him lying on your chest for a couple of minutes it might help him to get rid of some of his energy. Also see if you can look up baby wake times for his age range. The wonder weeks app is amazing too you might be in the middle of a leap which makes all of this so so much harder.

3338292,0,t3_2ye78h,We did sleep training at  months after we spent a night alternating which one of us held her so shed stay asleep. We used THE SLEEP LADYS GOOD NIGHT SLEEP TIGHT book which is a cross between Ferber and No Cry in that you are right there by the crib as they adjust to putting themselves to sleep. Our pediatrician warned us that the crying would escalate over the first three nights being worse on the second and third nights than on the first but would taper off after that. Babies learn pretty quickly. The first night she cried for about ten minutes the second for closer to twenty and the third for seven and then after that she would rarely cry at all. I would recommend that you use a lovey if you are starting sleep training. Having a soft furry to hold and comfort themselves with is a huge help. Also prepare to have to do some variation on the training again and again as things like colds or teething throw off what you usually do. I just had to retrain my  month old to be set down to fall asleep on her own again after shed been sick for a week. Weve now added an extra little cuddle and kiss before I put her down in the crib and shes been doing really well again.

3355823,0,t1_cpas11g,I truly believe it depends on the age and personality of the baby. Especially when they are very young crying because they arent being help is still trying to communicate a need. Their emotional need for comfort and physical contact is just as real as their physical need for food. If they need a soother the need to soothe themselves by sucking is just as real as their need for a fresh diaper. Eventually they will learn how to put it back in their mouths. All of this isnt to say that there wont be crying sometimes. I think the point of the article though is the idea that we should do our best to meet our childs needs no matter what kind of need rather than leaving them to cry on their own.There was a point in time where my daughter was inconsolable from teething and had an incredibly difficult time going to sleep. She didnt want to be held or rocked or nursed but she didnt want to be left alone either. So the way I dealt with it was to put her in her crib and set up a mattress on the floor where she could see me and hold my hand if she wanted.

It sounds like there are multiple staff in the room. Make a point to ask different staff how your child is doing. If you get a consistent story most likely its accurate. I think both you and your SO are right in this case. You have to trust a bit BUT you should always be a bit on your guard.

Its barely a noticeable thing but when I think about it his sleeping pattern has slightly changed. My bigger concern was that perhaps hes sleeping too much during the day all of a sudden!As for the dietician stuff I have a health visitor that comes to weigh him every fortnight and keeps track of his growth. and due to his second hospital stay a week after originally coming home he has a ton of upcoming appointments to see his progress. He had a urine infection and some minor liver issues so theyre still keeping an eye on him because of that and hes on lots of medication.

3712055,0,t3_32uxqr,I agree with the previous post about a baby gym. Our baby started to love her gym at that age. It really helped her learn how to swat then grasp toys. We used it to keep her entertained during diaper changes. She started with just looking at the items then she started to hit them. Other activities you can try are  singing songs together songs with finger play moving your hands to match the words  you can find examples of the movements onlineyoutube. Favorites are I had a baby turtle itsy bitsy spider twinkle twinkle little star and where is thumbkin. You basically can hold baby in your lap and move your hands in front of them then move their little fists around like they are doing it Leg games  prop baby on your angled legs and have them pretend run swim jump etc. You can also narrate a story or just say the motions really excited like. ok now we are swimming across the lake! or run run run jump!. Other leg games are singing songs like wheels on the bus moving legs to the motions of the song I made up more  doors open and close  Windows go up and down etc. reading books Museum tours of your house  ah here we have a painting of cat on a whale and there is a light switch!

We used to cosleep too so it was a big adjustment for her. When we first started it I would go in the room at longer intervals to comfort her but we realized that was actually making it worse and she would just cry harder so I stopped going in. The first night was hard she cried for almost an hour and a half then the second night was a half hour and ever since then its been smooth sailing  she falls asleep in less than  minutes  most nights its only . I know its not the most popular approach and it definitely doesnt work for all babies but once my daughter realized we werent going to come get her until the morning she stopped she even puts herself back to sleep if she wakes in the middle of the night.

So was bedsharing. All sorts of things no one used to bat an eye at are taboo now because there are dangers that can be associated with the practice. How statistically significant those dangers are is debatable. Its really a matter of riskreward and personal choice.

4235817,0,t3_39fsp6,Planned on a medication free labor. Got hypertension. Induced at  weeks. I was on a magnesium drip which made me so unbelievably horrifically tired that I could barely walk to the bathroom alone. On the other arm was a BP cuff that went off hourly. I had fallen down the stairs and bruised my spine a month prior and every contraction was in my back centered on that injury. I got the epidural and OMG it was amazing. I slept from cm to cm they woke me up to push. It only worked like  on the right side but I didnt mind because I could feel when I needed to push. The only downside was that I couldnt pee after they took the catheter out so I had to have a straight catheter once but then I was fine. Amazing  would recommend.

Im learning that the older my son gets the more things he finds to get upset about.  In addition to neck holes and sleeves he is very sad about getting his noseface wiped sunblock put on diapers changed not being allowed to grab fistfuls of my hair to yank not being allowed to rip my glasses off my face to eat and not being allowed to chew on the cat.

4285278,0,t3_3a2bsw,I do a lot of different things with my son who just turned  months two days ago. We sit on the couch and I just sit him back up when he falls over he doesnt fall often anymore! And I talk to him while we do this. Sometimes just making baby noises at him and sometimes singing or having conversations. I will play with his feet and hands and give him toys or a burp cloth to grasp. We do tummy time. Either I put him in his crib with toys and a mirror in front of him on the ground on a blanket or on our bed. He likes to have different views. Sometimes I lay on my back and put him on my tummy. He seems to really like this a lot. I make faces and he squeals! And sometimes he rolls off and looks all shocked like whoa what just happend?!. So funny.We sit propped in the boppy and play with toys. We hand him atuff or set it on his legs and he grabs things and hits them like he is trying to grab them. He wiggles around a lot so we have to constantly readjust him.We practice standing. He has loved this since like  months. Now we can just hold his hands and he will stand and practice balance and do squats. We started out just holding him under his arms. He really really loves this. He gets a big grin on his face when we do this after sitting. He LOVES to look around at stuff. He likes to watch the dogs. We only have the one now. And my moms boyfriends dog visits often. Whenever they walk past he is following them around with his eyes and turning his head. He likes to watch things and people in general. He has a jumper. He loves it! When your girl is big enough I hope she loves hers! It is great for when I need to eat or something. I just pop him in it and talk to him while I eatwhatever. Sometimes I just need a few minutes without a baby on me and this helps with that too. And pretty much everything is accompanied by plenty of talking and noise making playing with his feethands giving him kisses and just general interactiion. Sometimes though we also do quiet things like sit on the back patio when it is shady and listen to all the neighborhood animals or walk around the house just looking at things mostly when he is tired. And on occasion we watch a little tv with daddy. But really we try not to do this too much. He really loves watching the changing colors and stuff. And if Im feeling too tired to interact we do this.EDIT we also have a play mat that he has just started to actually enjoy.

Im the cry it out for  minutes guy and shes the  seconds equals  minutes girl and I end up in a conundrum where shes upset and sad because the toddlers crying so shell get him out of bed cuddle him then give him back to me to get to sleep inevitably.After hes asleep I do all the housework  cleaning laundry etc. She says she cleans the house during the day. She says shes vacuumed but I know she never wraps the cord back right and its still in the same place.From  ish when I get home until the next morning its her break for being with the toddler all day. She says she earned it since she got up with him at  and I lay in bed till  but I was up till  then I did some more work from  to  after toddler went to sleep so I can better my career for the sake of my family. The weekends she wants to go out to eat both days  lunch and dinner. I take care of the toddler  at every restaurant while she eats. I watch him at restaurants during the week now its your turn. I look at the bank records  no restaurants. Well if I went to a restaurant with you on a weekday Id help. Its fair that if were both here we both help right? That never goes over well. Meal ruined. You dont like spending time with your own son? Well...I love him to death and cherish every moment. Sometimes I need a hand.She works a full time job stay at home mom. I work a full time job then a half time job then an overtime job then a weekend job. She says its fair we put in equal work with the toddler. I actually agree but I still think the scales are tipped.I let all of this go because I love my family more than life itself and postpartum depression can sometimes drive right into longer term depression. Everything I do is to provide for my son and to help my wife out of it. We were living in a cramped house. I could see she was unhappy so overnight I moved us into a brand new house  square feet. Culdesac. The whole nine.  years ago I could not even fathom moving a mountain of this weight. But love does incredible things. And the greatest lesson Ive learned in life is that in my younger years I was selfish and didnt know a whole lot about relationships or what being a father meant. Now I do. Ive had this conversation with friends how do you split your time? And the response is usually Im the bread earner. Shes the mom. And thats it. What about you ProfWhite?

4386295,0,t3_3b8zy3,For both of my kids sleep regressions were MARKEDLY worse changes in overall sleep behavior and the amount of help they needed to get to sleep. One of them was a good sleeper slept five hours a night from early on during regressions she woke every two hours and one was a bad sleeper only slept  hours at the best during regressions he woke every  minutes. Naps got completely screwed up for both as well. Both times the four month sleep regression was devastating to me because you lose pretty much all ability to plan your day you spend the majority of your time putting someone to sleep knowing its futile you get little to no chance to rebuild your own sleep deficit which is already pretty large even when your child is a good sleeper. I have no idea whats going on with the people who say it was minor or never noticed it for me it was really really apparent with both kids. It was also apparent at the end of the regression that there had been a major cognitive leap growth spurt and skills upgrade so our strategy is just to hang on through regressions trying to keep the routine as much as possible but also doing what needs to be done to get the most sleep for the most people and then double down on consistency and routine when the regression seems to be over. ,beyondthebump,csk2lo4,1,t5_2u06v

Once we introduced a changing table to the environment we were able to isolate him and the stuff around him so that when he pees during a diaper change it mainly gets on the changing table and baby only.

But when we fixed the latch I could actually nurse on that injured side without pain. The nipple was able to heal through nursing because the latch was right. Basically the nipple goes so far in babys mouth that there is no friction when its right. It took a lot of practice. I had an IBCLC come to my house multiple times and eventually we got it right. I dont think breathe through the pain should be happening with a good latch in my experience.

4578388,0,t3_3dq9l3,Teething is rough for sure. Yes teething can cause a rash because of all the drool they swallow. It can also make some babies gassy. We have used Hylands teething tablets and they work fairly well but sometimes just arent enough. We dont use orajel because of the risks of choking due to making the throat numb. But infant motrin works great. People say Tylenol but thats actually not as much of a pain reliever as a fever reducer and and helps with swelling. So for things like teething it doesnt work as well. At least in my experience. ,beyondthebump,ct7pmgs,1,t5_2u06v

He got better but didnt go back to his cot. I ended up pushing our bed against the wall and having him between me and the wall. Unfortunately SO was getting a crappy sleep as he didnt have as much room as usual so we brought Oscars cot into our room took the side off and put it between my side of the bed and the wall. He still manages to sneak his way into bed with me sometimes as hes going through a very clingy I need mummy stage at  months but I wouldnt change it for anything.

4847262,0,t3_3h9n27,For us things got a little better around  weeks. It might sound silly but I highly suggest trying to start a loose bedtime routine around  weeks. Its going to seem really silly at first because your baby will go to sleep at all different hours of the night. What we did was make sure the lights were off and TV was on something boring no action movies kinda thing around  or pm. Every three days or so Id give a bath then a bottle around this time as well. As time went on baths became an everyday thing because he loves them so much. Eventually after doing this for about a month he finally realized what bedtime was and started sleeping longer stretches at night. As I paid attention to his cues he ended up setting his own bedtime this way and now we have bath time around  and he goes to sleep around . I believe in following your babys lead but they definitely need help learning the difference between day and night.,beyondthebump,cu5j802,2,t5_2u06v
4849112,1,t3_3hadd9,Im a first time mom to a  month old. I havent read any books but do frequent this sub and a few others pages in regards to advice.From what I gather there is some weird reason our society is dead set that babies need to SLEEP  hours without hardly a peep. How this is possible I have no idea. I cant sleep for  hours let alone  without getting hunger pains and being a savage bitch when I wake up. Anywho for comparison of schedules because I cant tell you what youre doing is right or wrong my girl goes down at pm she usually sleeps till I get in the room crib is sidecarred and then she sometimes sleep crawls over to me and nuzzles in. I usually notice her squirming to be fed once and then maybe  times during the night sleep for comfort or just to get through that weird sleep transition they have a hard time with. We usually get to sleep till am and then dad wakes us up because hes FAR from quiet. So her night time sleep is about hours.We also do the same up for ish hours then get an hour  hour and a half nap in the AM.The only reason we get a nice long nap like that is because of baby wearing. If I dont wear her she doesnt sleep. Shes waaaay too mobile cruising about a month off from walking and has a hell of a time shutting off her senses to sleep. Especially during daylight hours. Theres also another nap of  hours in the late afternoon ish.My daughter gets about  hrs of total nap time a day. If youre interacting with him doing tummy time feeding him playing going outside and seeing other people grandma Id say youre doing fine.

4864499,0,t3_3hh6r5,I have the b ready and a  month old and a  yr old they are  months apart. When I had the newborn I used the second seat sold separately on the bottom for my toddler and out the infant car seat on top. It worked well. Now I use both seats and the kids can sit in either seat no issues. If you want the toddler on top you have to buy an adapter for the infant car seat to fit on the bottom. I thought I might have wanted that easier for toddler to see and more room but it was like  and my kid was just fine down below...and the newborn stage doesnt last too long.So Id recommend it! I actually really like my stroller. But I am wary of how long my older one will want to sit in a stroller but that not the strollers fault. I have seen some double strollers where the kids can face each other city select I think and I do really like that option wish the britax had that. But thats my only con with the stroller really. Its easy to take the seats off to go places etc.Edit I guess another con is that it is kinda hard to get the kid in the bottom seat. There isnt much room and youve gotta kinda angle the kid in from the side because the handlebar is in the way. My kid will climb in but its awkward and tight. So another con but once you know that and get used to it its doable and fine...,beyondthebump,cu7ph1z,1,t5_2u06v

4983500,0,t3_3j67qm,G finally popped his first tooth! For a few weeks beforehand we could see a translucent white line under his gums but couldnt feel anything at all. About once every week or two hed wake up screamcrying he is normally a very good sleeper and wed give Motrin if he seemed especially irritable. His other big symptom was just generally being very protective of his mouth. He used to let me put my fingers in but he started really being avoidant to me looking or touching.About a week ago we noticed that his gums felt raised. Not rough and nothing sharp but I could feel something hard and swollen just under his gums.On Wednesday he woke up screamcrying and I looked and his gums looked like they had a little spot of blood but it wasnt on the surface it was just under the surface and I could see the translucent white line still. Gums seemed swollen and lots of drool. We gave Motrin and I figured wed have a tooth very soon.Friday morning there was a tooth!! Almost not visible but I could feel it sharp and poking through. Then we had two great nights of sleep... and then screamcrying again last night. Hes  months old so I figure well get a bunch of teeth pretty quickly!These pictures were helpful for me,beyondthebump,cump31y,1,t5_2u06v

Not to mention how doesnt he have the instinct to pick her up or comfort her if she cries!? Ive sadly seen a lot of posts like this on here and I think its awful and you should not put up with it. I think you need to speak to him. Babies learn from us to be social and interact the more you interact with them the more they learn to be sociable. You should be clear that sometimes you need a break and hes a parent too and needs to step up. Also you should consider pumping or giving a bottle of formula a day so he can at least feed her once and not have the shes hungry excuse. Also your baby is  months old by that stage they are very interactive. My little girl has been smiling back at us since she was  weeks and imitating faces and even before that she would track toys and study them. Shes now  months and is very sociable making faces at us no loves discovering new things so saying they dont do anything or dont interact might be true of the first few weeks but not at three months. ,beyondthebump,cupe4ob,1,t5_2u06v

On a bad night I would have to go back and repeat within  minutes. Eventually she started having good nights when I wouldnt have to nurse her again until  hours after bedtime then  hours then  hours then she started sleeping all the way through.

Very early labor began promptly and kept waking me up. I was in total denial. Saturday I was still in denial but in total nesting mode telling myself that I needed to get all the things done because I was having a csection in  days. My husband kept asking me how I was and wanted me to take it easy. Asshole neighbor came over that night to complain about the skunk living under our deck which we were trying to trap and told me I looked like I was ready to pop. Rage. Hes such an asshole. I was incredibly uncomfortable and I guess it showed but still in total denial. I didnt sleep much at all that night and around  a.m. I called the OB on call. She told me that because the contractions werent regular that I should stay home and take Benadryl to help me sleep which didnt work. Sunday morning I lost my mucus plug and my husband insisted on going to the hospital. This is a big deal because it was a  hour drive to the hospital over some mountains in late January. We decided that if they dont admit me well get a hotel room nearby. I was still in denial until I got admitted but was only dilated  cm but my contractions were crazy intense. I labored all Sunday didnt progress and got an epidural sometime Sunday night. After bubs went into distress twice with a very low heart rate they did an emergency csection at around  a.m. If I could do it over I wish I could have gone with the scheduled csection just because I wanted a few days to rest before bubs got here.

Contractions were getting rough and we arrived at the hospital there was a parade and a bunch of street closures around .  They put me on a monitor and my contractions were every  minutes but an exam said I was dilated cm well she said  then she said ... Im still not sure which it was.  They wanted to send us home and give me ambien which I am SO glad I did not do.After some discussion the high risk OB agreed that at  weeks I should be checked in and monitored.  I was strapped in around  and I sent my husband out to get food.  By the time he came back  minutes later I was in too much pain to eat and demanded the epidural.  Next time they checked me around  I was at cm.  So I was either at  cm when admitted or was at  and progressed to  within   hours.  Either way Im glad I did not just agree to go home.I also strongly recommend the epidural!  And get a contraction timer  it helps you figure out where you are.,beyondthebump,cv2mvo7,2,t5_2u06v

When she had her second her insurance had changed so she had to use a different hospitalmidwife. This hospital had a much higher csection amp intervention rate and the nurse treated her like she didnt believe her when she said she didnt have any IV with her first at the wellknown university hospital. The nurse acted like that was the most dangerous and irresponsible thing on the planet. Then they gave her an attitude during the birth whenever she moved around because of the pain and they had to get up from the nurses station and come readjust the required monitors. They were so rude to her and I cant imagine dealing with that on top of labor. Thats why I drove  miles to a low intervention hospital thats used to seeing unmedicated birth. No IV intermittent doppler in the tub and the nurse didnt rush me or get hostile. The hospital you pick is as important as your care provider. My sisters midwife was great but she still had to adhere to the nonevidence based hospital policies and that affected everything.,beyondthebump,cvq2chc,2,t5_2u06v

With your pinky of the same hand press into their cheek while putting the nipple in their mouth. Usually my baby will start sucking with the bottle in his mouth but if not twist the nipple and or pump the bottle up and down to get their suck to start.

But week  I slept in babys room and I did end up putting her in bed with me after like  am because I just wanted some damn sleep.  But then we decided I needed more sleep so we started taking shifts. My husband took care of her and fed her a bottle of pumped milk if she woke up between midnight. That allowed me to get a nice chunk of sleep until whenever she woke up again. It saved my sanity like seriously. Baby decided she no longer would accept bottles at week  though and so he brought her to me at  and we basically dream fed her. At her  week appt her pediatrician told us that she was gaining weight perfectly and to drop the dream feed so she doesnt get used to it and to just feed her when she wakes up. We have been doing that and it has worked out so good so far! Its hard having her in another room Im constantly checking the video monitor BUT I sleep deeper now than when I slept in her room.

She only upped it . ml more   Based on Zantacs dosing chart that puts him at just . ml over the very least amount he can take.  Which means he was technically below the minimum to begin with ugh!

Basically all the little rolls. ItsJust because its a moist warm environment. you have to dry those areas out good after. A bath and then I apply a little baby powder to keep them dry. Its just general baby ickiness. I do his neck with a wipe several times a day because that tends to be he worst area and I check everything else dying diaper and outfit changes but they usually only need a good cleaning at bath time.

5871395,0,t3_3vojl5,I understand! For my baby shower I purposely DIDNT register for any clothes. I wanted to buy them myself! Instead I registered for supplies. Bottles diaper pail sheets etc. I also registered for a few slightly pricier items hoping that people would go in on them knowing this was our first child and we had literally nothing. What did I get instead? So. Many. Clothes. Plus they were all dressy clothes that I knew he was never going to wear a button up shirt and jeans for a  month old? Really?!. I was so upset I cried for weeks. I thought about taking it all back but instead I took all the clothes and boxed them up by size. Eventually I got the things I needed thanks to some friends who had kids and didnt need some of their supplies anymore. The plus side? Every time my son grew I would take out a box of clothes so we had a few things set aside! It was really nice. Plus between my mom MIL and SIL I havent really had to buy my son any clothes I have picked up some cute things because I just had to though! which has saved so much money.In my opinion try to take it in stride. When you see your MIL dress up your daughter in one of her cute outfits and then change her into normal clothes when you change her diaper whoopsie! She peed a little on that cute dress! or something then put the cute clothes away.Another thing Ive done is offer up what my son needs in conversations. Just mentioning things like oh boy! His feet have gotten so big lately I need to get him some new socks! or With the weather getting so cold lately Im gonna have to pick up some more warm pants.

Get a grabber tool so you can pick things up from the floor without bending over. Stock up on foods that can be eaten with little preparation and no lifting or bending there was no way I could put a large casserole dish in the oven immediately after my csection. Have stations set up throughout your living space so you dont have to walk more than a few steps to change your baby or put the baby down in a safe sleeping area. One thing to keep in mind is that you cant lift anything heavier than the baby  including lifting the baby while in an infant car seat. Im five and a half weeks out and just now starting to lift the baby while hes in the car seat and its still hard. You also wont be able to drive  getting in and out of the car will be very uncomfortable for a couple weeks and you will need to be on heavy duty pain medication for at least the first week or so when you go home.

6135114,0,t3_3zl4kk,I was you. I was all oh Ill be fine and wont need much maternity leave because Ill miss work so much and then that last week of maternity leave? I was an absolute mess. Crying at the drop of a hat or at a picture of a baby on a diaper box at Target. I couldnt fathom leaving my son especially since he had come early and was only  weeks old.In order to calm my nerves my husband and I visited the daycare for about an hour one day before his official start. Just hung out and chatted with the providers and saw how everything goes down. It made me feel so much better. I left there feeling confident my son would be in good hands.My first day back to work I did great! I didnt even cry. My coworkers were super supportive and I was so busy that the day flew by.Looking back I realize now how hard maternity leave was. Taking care of a baby  isnt fun. Its hard. I like working. I love daycare. And I still love my son to death.I will say though that its still hard sometimes even  months later. I miss my kid! But I know hes happy in daycare and learning a billion more times faster and efficiently than he would being stuck with me all day long. Youll do great! This is for the benefit of you and baby. And if its not and you have the opportunity to stay home with him go for it. But working is not the end of the world. ,beyondthebump,cymzxob,3,t5_2u06v

During dynamic testing the forward flailing of the adult and the child resulted in severe body impacts against the forward seat.

It actually went from good to shit hits the fan bad..The first  weeks we were in NICU and he got a lot of antibiotics and a glucose drip so he was sleeping most of the time. At home then it was very easy I just nursed him and it usually took around min where he would then just sleepeat and then I just let him sleep until he got what he needed on sleep.This just then suddenly changed when he started to refuse the boob during the day and then also stopped having proper naps during the day and every nap is a real fight..We bounce on the bed it is really good bouncy so probably not going to waste money on a exercise ball. But with everything we try it only works  times or as soon as we stop something he wakes up and is just crying.When we finally get him to sleep he often wakes up  minutes later to cry.. and so on.. ,beyondthebump,cyt53g1,1,t5_2u06v

6253868,0,t3_418r1h,My son went to an inhome daycare at  months old. It was OK. The lady that ran it truly loved the kids so I didnt worry about him in her care. But she was so unorganized. Half the time Id pick him up and her cousin would be watching the kids and shed be gone. I knew her cousin and knew she had childcare experience and I liked her but it was still completely annoying. When her cousin took over at the end of the day I would have no report on how my sons day was. Hell half the time when the daycare lady was there Id get a limited report because shed be busy talking to other moms or rushing out of the house. Her scheduling could be wonky shed somehow have an endless run of paid personal days although she claimed she only took four a year. I had no idea what or how much he ate. I could never get her to give me a heads up when other kids got sick one time I texted her if she noticed my sons eye was pink during the day. She said no but two other kids had pinkeye so it was probably that. Awesome. Thanks for the heads up. She was generally awful at responding to messages. She started a preschool program with the kids but Im pretty sure my son got a bit lost in the mix. She swore the kids could count to  and could count back from  etc. but as it turns out only the girls could really do it and my son kind of just blended in but never learned. But the kids were cared for and about I at least knew that. So then we moved and I put my son in a center type daycare  school. He was technically in preschool and then prek but the place also does daycare for  weeks . I got daily reports when I picked him up written reports! How long he napped what he ate and how much any potty training accidents etc etc. I get one every day. The hours and the people are fairly consistent. They do fire drills and hes not stuck playing in the same small basement daycare room all day that he was at the inhome daycare. There are consistent rules and punishments. I know when he gets in trouble and when things happen. I know when kids are sick because they tell us and If its bad theyll post signs we have a confirmed case of strep throat. Hes so happy there. My infant will be going there as well. At first I was against the thought of putting a baby in a daycare center and now I love it. I have no worries about her being there. So I guess my rambling point is Id agree with others who say to look for a daycare center. At least from my experience. Yes there are more kids and it feels less like family but there are so many more upsides. ,beyondthebump,cz0hwep,8,t5_2u06v

Also I know it basically makes me a monster to imply that I like money more than time with my kid but wow I love being paid money.

6379683,0,t3_42z9xt,Mine is the same way about staying awake contentedly if we are out but needs more sleep if we are at home. Lately I try to make sure he gets at least one nap at home and then try not to worry too much about going out and naps. He can doze in the car or sleep in the carrier. And if we are out for a long time one day I usually try to keep the next day low key. Also in a believer that you dont have to entertain your baby all the time. Boredom is good for kids sometimes. During his wake time I will often put him on the floor and go do chores within eyesight. Sometimes he gets fussy and complains but then he starts scooting around and finds something to play with on his own. Thats how he discovered our big sliding glass door and outside and now he loves to look outside. He also discovered how to push the bottom of his rocker to make the chair move this way and he things thats hilarious.  wake up and play with dad short feed. Sometimes he goes back to sleep but lately not. If not play with toys crawl around or prop him up to look outside. Sometimes we bathe.  feed sit in rocking chair to digest first nap depending on nap lunch solidsAfter that we play more crawl around roll around be on the bed. If I have errands we go do them. My husband and MIL come over for lunch at  so he hangs with them for a bit. Theres usually a feed in there somewhere too.  or  second napWhen he wakes up we just do more of the same play dance crawl around a snack feed etc. If his nap was short he takes another short one around .  dinner solids and quiet time to wind down.

6443228,0,t1_czlekkw,Your experience may be different.  A child can be considered failure to thrive once it meets more than one of a series of criteria after multiple visits criteria like being under the th percentile for BMI on the WHO charts under the th percentile for weight velocity on the WHO charts length less than th percentile on the WHO charts weight decreasing two major percentile lines on the WHO charts and a few other things.  So I guess my point is I see a lot of stories posted over there where a poster is describing what amounts to a FTT situation based on those criteria and where a pediatrician or physician is recommending supplementation based on poor weight gain.  The story usually goes something like thisHelp!  My doctor wants me to supplement.  My baby was born lbs . and lost  of his body weight.  At  weeks he still wasnt back to birth weight so my doctor recommended coming back in a week for a weight check.  At his  month visit he weighed lbs oz th percentile.  I added a pump in the morning and started supplementing with the pumped milk after his first nap.   At  months he weighed lbs oz th percentile  Now hes saying I need to start giving him formula!  In this kind of story no one is using the words failure to thrive it may not even have been mentioned by the pediatrician but here is a perfect example of FTT in living color.  Yet in these scenarios rbreastfeeding starts talking about disliking the pediatrician the shitty formula industry suggesting more nursing suggesting second opinions suggesting ignoring the advice etc.  Doctors dont invent this research.  ,beyondthebump,czlrphm,2,t5_2u06v

My son has been exposed to Spanish for about two months now and he understands when I say certain things in Spanish. In particular when I say I am about to go! Really I speak to him in English but he certainly hears me speak Spanish frequently and his dad only speaks Spanish. Before we lived in Thailand and I am sure he understood more Thai than I did  he went to a Thai daycare the nanny spoke some English for me but I am sure she spoke almost exclusively Thai otherwise. We left Thailand when he was  months old and honestly I think it caused a delay in his speech. He was saying mama when we left but stopped and only recently started saying it again. I am not expecting him to be a fast talker at all due to so many languages and changes in his life.

This would cause baby to suffer similar injuries as though the harness was simply not tightened enough because baby would be thrown up against it.

Just dont get into a habit of doing that. Theres a reason babies hang out on their backs and bellies at first and only learn to sit up much later on.Edit I want to mention that I dont mean this would cause spinal injury right now. When sat up at this age they often noticeably slouch and end up putting a lot of pressure on the disks. This can lead to nothing or to problems that surface later in life. Therefore in my country physicians advise against it.Edit  hey guys Im a bit disappointed in you. Downvotes for being the only one expressing a different standpoint? OP asked for opinions.

In the beginning he preferred to make food for me while I pumped do the laundry grocery shopping etc. and still does sometimes but hours upon hours of oneonone entertaining of an infant gets to be very draining and I had to push him to take on some of that heavy lifting. It took some getting used to on his part and a lot of encouragement loving and understanding not belittling on mine but eventually it came to him too. Hes so proud of being able to play with her now to make her laugh and smile!I think if more men were willing to acknowledge the learningcurve there is to spending quality time with an infant perhaps daughters especially they might be more open to getting the hang of it.

Bonus if shell sleep on her tummy on your chest if you are in a slightly supine position it counts as tummy time and will help strengthen her for better and earlier physical development. When you need a break swaddle the baby and lay her in something not flat. Do you have a rock and play or a swing? While those are discouraged for sleeping at night your newborn is only napping for  hours at a time anyway. I also used the summer reach cosleeper but my baby required an incline for reflux so if you use that try to put something under the head to give it a bit of incline.Edit you cant give a newborn bad sleep habits their sleep is already awful and they are going to wake up to eat every couple hours because their tiny tummy is empty.

Hes been so much happier the last  hours. Breastfed babies can transition from pooping every feed to every day to every few days. That might be happening with yours. Mine gets fussy but I think Im starting to see the benefits of cutting dairy out. It sucks but if hes more comfortable thats better for everyone. Its a  hour turn around for food so the Brussels sprouts arent going to bug your baby the day of. It does have a big effect... youve got a good pediatrician to know that. Big culprits are dairy chocolate and caffeine. Try one at a time for a week. You cant coddle a baby this young.

6945498,0,t3_4asy1t,Nursing to sleep isnt bad at all Its pretty much natures way of helping kids get to sleep. And I hate to say this but... most babies dont fall asleep on their own until age ...and even then they regress to needing external comfort whenever they go through a developmental stagegrowth spurtget sick.All babies figure out sleep on their own timeline  its like walking or any other developmental step. You cant train a baby to sleep. This HuffPo article was just posted in this sub and its worth a read to help you feel better about just doing what works to get through this bumpy period. The more stress it causes you the more stress your baby picks up on and the more clingy they get...Most of the time socalled sleep problems are parental expectation that baby should be sleeping in a crib or that nursing to sleep is wrong and these are based on outdated information and old science. Not all babies can be put down drowsy but awake and I hated that too...neither of my kids are able to do that...nurse them into a coma! I say! All of that being said we used some Ferber training with my first daughter at  months once we knew she was ready for sleeping through the night  she was getting up to nurse and nursing back to sleep a LOT every  min and it was making her too tired through the day. She was just learning how to walk and hitting a big growth spurt so after that was over we transitioned her night waking routine to have my husband comfort her instead of me nursing her back to sleep. It didnt involve much crying it out at all.I wish I had used a sidecar crib with my first because all of the getting out of bed and trying to put her down was EXHAUSTING  it also woke me up so much that I had a hard time getting back to sleep! With baby  we did a DIY sidecar so that now at  months shes able to sleep next to me get up nurse and we can either dozerest for a bit or she can go back into the crib without the whole back and forth. I also use a red nightlight because it doesnt wake up your brain as much as white light...You can get through this  go with what your baby needs right now not what you read youre supposed to do. ,beyondthebump,d13lp9o,0,t5_2u06v

7165079,0,t3_4dmho0,My now  month old would hit my husband or I in the face when he was mad.  We did the same things you did.  We would tell him no and to be gentle.  After a few weeks that didnt seem to be working so when he hit me I would sternly tell him no that it hurt and I would walk away.  This did not work.  After a few weeks when he hit me again I would sit him down and we would have a time out in my lap.  I would count backwards from  when he calmed down and then he could get back up.  It didnt stop the hitting but it certainly made him calm down faster.  About a week ago he hit my face again.  I grabbed his little hand and made him hit himself in the face a few times not hard but it stunned him.  I then told him it hurt it really doesnt but you get the idea and then told him to go find something else to do because it wasnt worth it to be angry.  Im not sure if that was the magic response but he hasnt hit me once since then and this was a kid who would hit everyday.He still gets angry and I can see he wants to use his hands when hes especially mad but he hasnt hit me again.  So far that was what worked.  This may not work for you since all kids respond differently but if youre okay with making your kid slap himself on his cheek not enough to hurt obviously! then maybe give it a whirl?Good luck!

You would be super surprised how many couples have dealt with infidelity and not broken up.However if you really feel that you cant get over it or try counselling and discover that you cant. Its probably better to split than to make everyone miserable by trying to stay together for the sake of your child. My parents stayed together for  years despite there being strong reasons not to about four years after marrying. It was a mistake and their lives would have been infinitely better if theyd just bit the bullet and done it when they first knew it wouldnt work.However infidelity was just one of their issues. They had a myriad. So dont feel like youre compromising yourself if you decide that you love him and your family more than you hate the infidelity.

We started solids a little before  months and once he got used to them he cut down to a more manageable   oz breast milk  bottles and eats a pouch of pures for lunch. Not sure if this is the most correct thing since I know solids shouldnt take the place of breast milk before a year but his teachers say he seems much more full and satisfied during the day. Around  months we started bringing in puffs for him since he was getting jealous of the other kids at snack time and between his wet diapers and weight gain were not too worried about him being hungry anymore. ,beyondthebump,d2862r1,1,t5_2u06v

Anyways we used to have to give bottles and fortify with formula and micro lipid and then after his last surgery he was able to just do breastmilk but i didnt produce enough for him. I always pumped after bottling him and now I finally make enough for him to exclusively breast feed! If its something you really want to do dont give up on the pumping with every meal.  If it isnt something you want to do dont worry about it! Formula is so safe and healthy. I think for normal term infants it can get overhyped.

If I had the super essentials mentioned in this post sleep space bedding lights diaps amp wipes... all I would really want for thus far is information.  With all the struggle and trauma your friends are going through with a tough pregnancy the last thing they may be thinking about is learning the ropes.Google is great but there is so much conflict of opinion on what is right for the baby you can really get mixed up and actually start finding the answers you WANT to hear instead of what is actually good for your child.  Not to mention all the crap advice and old wives tales by uninformed busybodies pot... meet kettle.We had a planned Cesarean and with wifey semioutofcommission this book and site have helped me get through these two weeks like butter  www.beprepared.net.

I think you should only have a second child if you and your partner really want one.

7689066,0,t3_4kkv9i,Congratulations!You arent alone and these feelings are completely normal. The next couple of weeks will be tough and you may feel like you are in a very dark place. People will keep telling you that it will get better and you may not believe it but it will. My LO is now  weeks and  days old and I feel like I am now starting to understand what she needs and each day feels a little easier. You will find little tricks that will help you out. For example during the day my daughter will only reliably fall asleep in her sling. Sure sometimes she will wake up when I try and put her down but I can make myself a cup of tea or wash up while she naps. Oh and something that surprised me is that they will sometimes fight falling asleep but will end up over tired and incredibly cranky. I wish someone told me this before so I could prepare myself. So dont be afraid to try anything to get her off to sleep it will make both you and her a lot happier. I also found going out for walks even just short ones helps my mood.I also BF and sometimes it will feel like they never come off! The best advice there I can give is to set yourself up in a comfy spot with all the snacks you love and watch some TV. I found if I dont watch or do something even redditing on my phone I started to hate the whole experience as I never had me time. Now I love it. I  have finally watched a number of series that I have been meaning to for ages! Dont be afraid to pump either so someone else can feed her so you can rest up. I have been told by health visitors that breast milk can be stored for  days in the fridge and  months in the freezer so you dont have to use it straight away. So if family or friends offer to babysit for a couple of hours throw them your milk and enjoy yourself for a bit! Nipple confusion is a problem but we have been lucky and ours takes anything as long as theres food. Every baby is different so if something works for you and her go for it. However if you are still feeling low and crying excessively some tears now and again are normal in a couple of weeks please please please see a health professional. PPD is very real and should be taken seriously. No one should feel ashamed about seeking help. One day your baby will smile at you not just the gassy ones  but you can pretend they are real and all those bad days will seem like an eternity ago. If you ever want to chat drop me a message some time. ,beyondthebump,d3g74rq,1,t5_2u06v

While we love our families their presence wouldnt have been very helpful during that steep initial learning curve of becoming brand new parents.

Granted during that we took her to my nephews first birthday party so she may have slept because she was overwhelmed. She would eat for a couple of minutes then fall asleep immediately. Luckily that passed. especially since she only recently got to a point where its possible to lay her down and shell stay sleeping or fall back asleep Other times she cluster fed which for me means eat fall asleep repeat with some poop and play in there. Shes recently also started to arch her back when shes overtired. Im able to get her to settle down on the boob but she generally protests a bit now. She also has screamoclocks where she shrieks for a bit for fun. Not sure what thats about. Sometimes she poops afterwards. Probably not growth spurt related though. Do you have the Wonder Weeks app?

7819743,0,t3_4me0f0,Hi there! We are one week postcircumcision so I thought Id share our experience. We decided to circumcise for the simple reason that baby would match daddy and maybe there would be less confusion when it came to potty training and questions about his own body.The procedure took minutes to do but we werent present because the pediatrician said that it would be harder on us than on him. The pediatrician said he sucked on his pacifier recommended to bring one and didnt cry at all. And one week on he has never seemed to be in any pain or discomfort at all. My best advice is to be prepared for what a normally healing penis looks like. The tip was a bright blood red for about  hours then settled down and became less and less red and a half day. Its back to fleshcolored now. There were some tiny tiny blood drops on his diaper for a few hours afterward. It hasnt bled at all since the first day since. And care has been very simple. Just vasiline on the tip each diaper change and if any poo gets up there wash with warm water no wipes. Like I said it got more and more fleshcolored each day and some light yellow granulation as it heals is normal. Be on the lookout for appetite changes and fever as signs of infection as well as smelly discharge.Hope this helps! It was a very easy process for us.,beyondthebump,d3v05z9,3,t5_2u06v
7829461,0,t3_4me0f0,I know you already have a lot of responses but Ill throw my  cents anyway. My LO is  months and is circumcized. I wish we hadnt done it. We were given no information on how it would be done and they used a devoce called a plastibell which basically cuts off circulation to the foreskin and makes it rot off. Its the new way of doing it and supposedly gives better results. We were not consulted about this tool. It looked very painful for days and Im sure it was. We were also not given any aftercare instructions other than not to touch it. My son has two penile adhesions one of which separated a few months ago and was very painful for him. Apparently adhesions are from not caring for it properly during healing but like I said we were told nothing. The other side will eventually separate as well. I feel that if we had been told what the procedure was or were given a choice between the traditional cut or the plastibell we would have chosen the traditional cut. If I were to do it again i dont think I would. Lastly my biggest regret is that all I can imagine when I think of it is my newborn baby less than  days old strapped down to a table probably crying in fear while some doctor fucks up his genitals. It makes me so sad and angry with myself that I let it happen. In the hospital when they brought him back to my recovery room I cried because all I could picture was my poor baby so scared. I dont know if he was he was sleeping when they took him and was asleep when he returned so who knows but still. Obligatory apologies because Im on my phone. ,beyondthebump,d3w3jum,8,t5_2u06v

7878017,0,t3_4n1k2j,A little late weighing in but in case it helps...We spent three weeks doing a road trip in New Zealand with ours who was . months old at the time and is a pretty easy baby. The most driving we did in one day was  hours and some of that was while she was crying and pissed but we couldnt always stop. Your  month old probably can do a little bit longer but I would be shocked if you could do  or even  hours per day.There is NO way you could do this wo your inlaws helping. You will be TIRED and not just from driving. I was wiped at the end of our long driving days and I was just sitting in the back with our baby. Why? Listening to a crying baby is gut wrenching while stuck right next to her and not being able to do anything about it while driving. For my husband it made driving on unfamiliar but easy roads that much more stressful. Nursingfeeding with a bottle in the car isnt always comfortable. Changing diapers on the side of the road andor hunched over in the backseat of a car is not the same as doing it while in the comfort of your own home. Doing all of this multiple times a day will kill your back if youre tall like me and your baby is heavy like mine.Also you will be slow going not just because of the baby but also because of the Uhaul  car being towed. I think you guys might be way overestimating how far youre able to drive in one day due to both reasons.Not trying to be a buzzkill but I think you guys are biting off way more than you should reasonably chew. This trip will be exhausting for all of you. Maybe you can pay a friend or family member to drive your car and you and the baby fly? ,beyondthebump,d41k8kg,2,t5_2u06v

8237793,0,t3_4s7gwo,I formula fed my baby while I was on some medication for two weeks. After that my baby got lazy and I exclusively pumped for about a month. My doctor was amazingly supportive of any decisions. He said of course breast is best if you cant then pump exclusively if you cant do that mix half with formula if that doesnt work feed your baby formula. Theyre all good at nourishing your baby.  Exclusively pumping is EXHAUSTING at first. Once you get a rhythm it gets better. What I did was get a good pumping bra and pumped while I fed my baby propped up on the boppy pillow that seemed useless. If that doesnt work you can just set the baby in the crook of your knee.   For the exhaustion I started letting my body sleep a little more between some of my sessions. I would allow myself  hours of sleep before the next feed while hubby fed her a prepared bottle. I did this twice a day and it helped me get enough sleep to produce more milk ironic huh? your body is on  hour demand for milk but your body needs sleep to produce more. Have a staging area by the bed so you can just grab and pump and go back to sleep. Youll feel like all youre doing is sleeping and pumping but this will be life until your little bundle starts sleeping longer.  For sleep woes swaddles worked wonders for my child. I didnt want to use it at first because it seemed cruel to me but after two weeks of no sleep I got desperate and put her in. She struggled and still does for a few minutes then out like a light. Its magic. I prefer the Halo swaddle since its a bit more secure but even using a swaddle blanket works just fine. I had to rock her into a deep sleep for the first month or so if I wanted her to sleep in the crib. Now at two and a half months I can put her in drowsy and shell usually sleep on her own.

They answer when I call them by their full names and they answer to some nicknames.  Its true I picked the names but in the end theyll chose what they want to be called.

There is just a correlation between breastfed babies and a mothers heightened awareness. It doesnt mean that you cant have that same type of awareness. How old is your baby? I started cosleeping in small intervals when my baby was  months old. Short naps early morning snuggles. I left a low light on during the early hours so I could see my daughter physically know where she was at. The more comfortable I got the longer I would let her sleep. Eventually dropping out the nightlight. It took a couple of weeks but I am so glad I did. I wasnt getting any sleep and my body was boycotting.

Maybe not the same as you did before baby but it gets better I promise.  Keep trying a soother.  Dont try too many formulas from what Ive heard thats not good makes theyre tummy more upset.  Maybe try renting the hospital grade pump I rented it for  a month and maybe just keep pumping and do formula as well?

8435562,0,t3_4v6r0l,For office visits and prescriptions and stuff like that you should only have to pay a copay. Ask your ins if copays contribute to your out of pocket max. Some do and some dont. Usually for hospital surgery and emergency visits you will have to pay the full amount until you hit your deductible then it sounds like for your plan you have a copay after that. In this case Im guessing your copay will go to your OOP max. Once you meet your deductible and OOP max separately then everything will be covered at . For the year of course. I hope thats not confusing. I also second calling your ins to confirm since they all have different rules. Im not sure what the other ins was but one advantage of having BC is that practically everywhere is in network with them. ,beyondthebump,d5vzgnv,2,t5_2u06v

I pumped and bottle fed him read him books books worked wonders rotated out toys so hed stay entertained and played musicsang songs. I dont let the little guy watch tv at home but I loaded up my iPad with Sesame Street just in case. We havent needed it yet but it feels good knowing its there.If you have a good nap schedule follow that. Ours naps at am and then again around  most days so we always got on the road by am for his nap. Hed sleep. Then wed play. Then before his next nap wed stop let him crawl around for a bit then get him in the car for the next nap. At night when we were in a hotel room wed let him burn off as much energy as possible and we would just eat in the room and not take him out to a restaurant. He really needed that time to unwind.If the baby is sleeping were driving. No pit stops unless its an emergency.

Haha yeah well.Absolutely go to physical therapy. In my opinion  weeks is WAY too early you are barely healed by this point. Are you having incontinence issues or significant pain still? I did PT but I probably started at  or  months out. Just take it easy on yourself.You will get two main things from PT. They will manually check for weakness and spasms and may massage out spasming muscles. This will be painful but its super important.. They will recommend excersises to improve weakness. This is the infamous kegel and other pelvic floor exercises. However I have had great results from doing functional exercises namely squatting and walking. I cant recommend walking enough you need to start slow and work your way up but its an amazing way to strengthen your pelvic floor in a holistic way. When you first start it will feel like your chassy is dropping out...its not just take it day by day. Walking outside with baby has the added benefit of stabilizing naps and calming baby and helping mama with baby blues.Finally remember that everybody is a little different down there after giving birth.

8590832,0,t3_4xd2df,I pumped for my twins for about  or  months. I made enough to feed them both until about  months but then they hit a growth spurt and I couldnt keep up so I had to start supplementing. In order to keep every bottle the same and they didnt have to adjust to it Id make it  milk  formula. I did that until they grew again and then it was . By the end it was  milk and  formula then even less and I was wondering WTF I was even doing it for anymore. Then I got sick of being fat took up running and that pretty much killed my milk supply anyway.Your decrease in supply is probably a mixture of things. Being sick of doing it wondering if its worth it stress annoyance lack of sleep...etc. all of those things can make your milk supply take a hit. I had it where I was so tired I barely made anything on pump session. I took a huge long nap and pumped a ton.What kind of pump do you use? I have a Medela Pump N Style and you have to replace those little white disks after a while because they do wear out or get holes in them. That can be a huge factor in strong vs. weak suction. I had to call the company for troubleshooting once and they talked me through the process of cleaning it out and getting the dust out of it as well. It worked better for a while after that. Ive pretty much worn it out now though.I had different pumping session lengths throughout the day. I pumped for literally  hours every single morning then about  mins the rest of the day. That was hard as heck to do when you youve got twins crying and  other kids running around ignoring everything you tell them and being kinda bratty because they know when youre pumping youre not gonna do anything about it. I couldnt. If I had to quit pumping and get up a do a bunch of crap I could NOT relax enough for my milk to let down properly. I could only pump one breast at a time while continuously massaging and squeezing them. I had to pretty much wring every drop out of them as it was. After about  months I learned to hate that damn pump. I still hate it and hope I can nurse this next baby. I started mentioning to my husband that I didnt want to pump anymore but he told me we didnt really have a choice because there was no way we could afford formula for twins. After that though my heart wasnt really in it anymore and my supply slowly but surely declined.You have to weigh the pros and cons write a list if you have to of either choice. I hated it but I still did it because I had to. I was so glad to be free of the pump.You said you are sick of oatmeal and believe the fenugreek didnt agree with your LO. I was a fenugreek and oatmeal girl myself. You can also eat certain nuts and make lactation cookies if youre looking for different ways to ingest it.Do you use essential oils? You can use fennel or basil to increase your milk production. You just dilute it as recommended and apply  drops to your breasts. You shouldnt use the fennel for more than  days though.

After that you will kind of conk out immediately and enter the restful stage of sleep almost instantly. It will get to the point where youll get  hours of sleep and feel amazing.

Im not a peds nurse but during my pediatric clinical rotation at the hospital I cared for two babies one around  months old the other around  months old who had aspiration pneumonia due to drinking bottles in their crib.  Unfortunately in both of these cases it wasnt because the baby wanted itit comforted them to sleep it was because the moms wanted to go drinkparty and didnt want to have to bother to feed them. However the risks are still the same. Most people would notice if the babies are choking however sometimes they can just get it down the wrong pipe where it settles in their lungs and then can cause an infection. Also once they get teeth it can cause them to rot.

My BP was really high I was spilling protein in my urine and I was having contractions so they were scared I would go into labor early or my preeclampsia would cause a seizure. They tried the version which was unsuccessful. I had an epidural beforehand and I wont lie it hurt!! But I would definitely do it again! I ended up having a csection right after the version failed because of LO being breech and PreE. It was really intense! I was very nervous! I could feel tugs and pulls during the surgery and the medications made me nauseated shaky cold and fuzzy. All in all it took about one hour from version to baby. Ill be super honest and say I didnt have the birth experience I wanted at all....and I had very low expectations. LO ended up being carted off to NICU for a slight breathing problem. Not being able to hold her was excruciating for me. She was only there for a few hours. NICU moms who have LOs with extended stays are strong as hell. Major props to them. When she did get to the room we were of course overjoyed. Unfortunately either due to having her via csection early or due other reasons my milk never really came in. Believe me when I say I tried everything under the sun. I only yielded about oz a day. So that sucked. We bottle fed and shes perfect. I have this little lady to love and hold and admire.

Everything in it... I remember playing Led Zeppelin  to my  month old daughter and watching her react to it.  It was amazing.  Show them the world and subject your child to different people and experiences and you will be able to gauge how normal they are by their reactions to their surroundings  much more easily than by comparing them to a table of normal behaviours based upon age.  ,beyondthebump,d7ads0d,6,t5_2u06v

He eats this up really well most of the time but maybe will only have one half of toast.L Half a turkey sandwich turkey american cheese mustard mayo cut up grapes some kind of veggie. Milk is served with lunch.Afternoon Snack Always depends but can typically range from crackers fruit snacks banana apple a yogurt cup.D Veggie spaghetti I dont remember the brand but its spaghetti noodles with spinach and zucchini pasta sauce meatballs.  Breadstick.  He can put away a decent sized bowl and entire breadstick on a good day.PreBed Snack  He always gets milk but snacks range depending on hunger or what we are doing ie popcorn with a movie.  Snacks tend to be a banana muffin some other fruit cup applesauce graham crackers stuff like that.Sometimes I take a picture of his food before he eats it so I have a good idea of how much he actually put away since I always would rather put too much in front of him and have him not eat it all vs. put too little in front of him and hope that Ill understand any request for more.,beyondthebump,d7f3n5s,1,t5_2u06v

8952008,0,t3_52vjb5,I think the women that dont go through a traumatic pregnancy or labordelivery simply just dont get it. And their way of trying to connect is by coming up with the worst thing thats happened to them or what is currently happening to them. It sounds like you know they mean well but those comments dont do anything for you. And I get the vibe that these are people youre close to. I think its possible to express how their words arent helping but hurting you more. I had plenty of troubles with the highlights being that I metabolize painblocking medication quickly and I could feel the staples go in during my csection after hours of my epidural not working. Followed by having to have my incision packed daily for  weeks bc it wasnt healing correctly... with a colicky baby and my husband having back problems and couldnt bend over or lift much... and my BIL having realized he had a heart valve infection and was admitted to the hospital on the day I was released... so my family wasnt able to support and help us as nearly as much as they said theyd be able to. Coupled with the normal things that any woman goes through .... hormone swings figuring out breastfeeding lack of sleep .... I just pretty much told them to cram it when they kept saying at six weeks things will be so much better. I just kept saying I dont care. Because were on week  and this has been hell. I cant POSSIBLY imagine getting to  weeks. I feel like when I started setting boundaries maybe youve discussed this in your therapy before I started to get the emotional helpsupport I was yearning for. Regardless I think it does help to talk about it. Talk about your pain. Your emotions. Everything is very real. To you. Now. Get the help you need.

9123567,0,t3_556uyd,You do what you need to do for your health mental and physical. You need to be healthy so that you can give baby your best. Dont feel guilty. I will say that I feel ya.  I have a two month old who is only now learning how to use her tongue properly after a tongue tie fix several weeks ago and wont latch most of the time without a nipple shield.  And my nipples are still a little sore and yes still seeing a LC. My nipples were incredibly sore the first few weeks and much less sensitive now.  So it can get better.  But I didnt deal with all the incredibly stressful complications that you did. Breastfeeding isnt easy and you should do what works for your family. Especially if it is effecting your mood.  You could also consider just pumping for as long as that makes sense.  My good friend had a ton of issues with getting her son to latch correctly went to pumping only and supplementing some with formula and she is so much happier for it even though she had really wanted to breastfeed.  But in the end all that matter is a fed baby and happy mom who can be there for baby.  Hugs!  ,beyondthebump,d88i58w,1,t5_2u06v

Im not in the business of prostitution therefore my body is not part of the customer service experience and with that the guy breached the unspoken clientemployee conduct and no longer receives my working face. My manager had no problem with me reacting that way and dug that I was assertive she also worked there while pregnant and knows just what its like.This time around pregnant with Number   weeks along while taking a break in class at university I was chatting with a classmate and she touched my belly in that usual way that we have all encountered. I gave a direct you need to ask a pregnant woman before touching her stomach without anger defensiveness or anything and after her surprised look that she was called out and I think also realising the reality of it further explained that pretty much every pregnant lady has had this happen and its this crazy phenomenon where it seems that our bellies extend outside our realm of personal space.After ALL THAT rambling the point Im trying to make is that it seems to be some odd societal compulsion to be a part of someones pregnancy experience whether they know them at all or not.

9562660,0,t1_d9rrj5o,Are you perfect? Do you never make a mistake when you parent? Thats why some of us tolerate each other. We understand that we have to carry each other at times. When a mistake is made we know that the good far outweighs any bad. Im saying my man child puts in a lot of hard work and long hours to make a lot of money for our family. He may not get to be as present as he wants but that is the sacrifice he makes. He misses out on things so they can have a better tomorrow. I never said this was a repeated occurrence. So could you also explain to me why this one rant gives you the ability to guess how my or other moms lives are really like? Im straightt up baffled by this shit. I never once said he was a terrible father or has a repeated track record of doing anything along these lines.  Im sorry but if you work an  hour day for  days in a row see how much parenting you get done and see how successful you are. I married a farmer and I knew this would happen when I married him. I knew this with my first and you can bet I will deal with it with this next child. Otherwise he is a very present father. Im sorry you failed to see the humor that I alluded to with my final comment before the edits. It was alluding to the mom who had her mom watch her child. She got a nice long bath and read her book. It was a compare and contrast. if you cant be supportive just go somewhere else. I slept on the couch bc it was my choice. I didnt know I needed to go into detail regarding the fight.

No. you are a grown woman its your cat they dont get to take it away. Go and get it back.But if they cant understand that then start to build perspective. Find something precious of his that is unsafe to babies. In this bubble age that wont be hard. Then hand it off to a friend and tell him how wonderful it is that the baby is safe and his things are out of the house. Find some wingnut article about how wifi is unsafe for babies and pull all devices or something. Then when he blows his lid say oh did you want to have a discussion like adults over what is unsafe or safe for the baby we will raise together and come to a compromise or solution as a team? Yes we can do that. About my cat. REGARDLESS go and take your cat back today.

Did you bring a playard for the baby to sleep in at your destination and if so did you check it or carry it on? Did you buy a superlight playard e.g. Baby Bjorn just for the occasion? The airline were taking requires that babies in their own seats use an approved car seat. Because of this were considering taking her as a lap baby. If you did take a car seat assuming the baby has outgrown the infant car seat how did you transport a convertible car seat around the airport and to your destination?

9882334,0,t1_davks95,So I see youre trying to evaluate the goodness of your babys food. Unfortunately theres no real way to numerically rank foods and food sources on a  scale based on goodness  how do we even determine that? People come up with their own ways. For you right now you seem to be focused on how natural your babys food is but maybe thats not the best way to determine goodness.Keep in mind natural doesnt really mean anything and its not always better. Pure MSG falls under the term all natural by FDA standards because its derived from plant material. Arsenic is very natural its elemental  the purest simplest form that something can be  and that shitll kill ya. So will a diet entirely composed of organic allnatural farmfresh glutenfree nonbovinegrowthhormone ice cream. But its natural! Sure but its still no good. Natural doesnt help us evaluate goodness.So it might help for you to drop the term natural as your goalpost and look for other more descriptive more meaningful terms that help you figure out what you want. Then look into the actual meanings of these terms and understand them better too. As an example many people say they want less processed substances in their diet. Okay well consider the fact that processing is another blanket term that has many meanings  if I told you that your breakfast cereal from this morning had been crushed repeatedly by structures made of calcium phosphate specifically in the chemical arrangement termed calcium hydroxylapatite and injected with an aqueous solution of glycoproteins enzymes like amylase and lipase and antimicrobial agents like secretory lgA and lysozyme then soaked in a hydrochloric acidpotassium chloridesodium chloride bath for a few hours just to get it into a state where it was compatible with your bodys digestion you might start freaking out. No more processing! Boycott Cheerios! Theyre inedible without hydroxylalawhatwasitagain? But um thats just a scary way of describing chewing food and mixing it with saliva and stomach acid which is kind of necessary. So obviously we can see that some processing of food products is generally necessary in order to take foods from their natural there we go again see natural isnt always better state into one that we can actually make use of. Processedness in and of itself isnt necessarily the best yardstick to use for measuring goodness either.Instead of obsessing over concepts like natural or even really how processed something is Ive found that nutritional is a MUCH better way to evaluate foods and determine their goodness. What vitamins and minerals does this food provide? Does it have a healthy ageappropriate balance of healthy fats proteins and carbohydrates each in a digestible form that is baby can actually draw these nutrients out of the food and into their body? Are lessbeneficial elements such as saturated fats and sugars kept to a minimum in order to minimize the actual harm done by the food? If there are sugars included do they have a purpose any purpose other than makes it taste good so people eat more? Does the calorie count fit into babys ageappropriate nutritional needs providing calories and important energy alongside vital nutrients and other food components or is it empty calories with no other benefit? What preservatives are used basically all food has preservatives unless it was killed yesterday used to be people would just salt the shit out of their meat but now we know hypertension and flavor profile is a thing so weve moved to more advanced versions in what quantities and are these preservative choices and amounts reasonable for this type of food? The answer to all of these types of questions in regard to baby formula is YES this food is nutritionally appropriate and beneficial for my child. Like another commenter has said formula is probably the most extensively studied and regulated and refined by which I mean editedtweaked I dont mean like refined sugar which is not nutritional food product in our country if not the world we have made leaps and bounds in making formula better and better for our babies our most precious responsibilities our future. It offers so much so close to breastmilk and maybe even some things that many moms cant offer when you were breastfeeding did you regularly sample your milk and labtest it to ensure that it contained exactly the ideal ratios and amounts of each and every vitamin and mineral that baby needs? No? Because formula manufacturers do. Not saying either of BFFF is better just pointing out some pros to formula that you might not have realized. Its not a bad thing for food to be made in a lab. Its not a bad thing for food to be made in a lab. Its not a bad thing for food to be made in a lab. The levels of precision and intentionality are much higher and there is more rigor and higher standards for the output. Meanwhile breast milk is over here like idk man Im just the result of a couple bazillion generations of humanoids who didnt die quite as fast as other humanoids Im pretty neat but I could probably be better if someone had designed me from scratch.

No.  Walk away.  Dont bother.  Dont add that stress into your life.  It will be ON THEM to decide if they want to be in her life.    I also lost a lot of blood during labor and nearly died.  What youre experiencing is normal for that kind of trauma.  Talk to your doctor tell them your concerns and DO NOT let them push postpartum depression manuals on you.  You are NOT depressed well you might be but those thoughts youre having are PTSDanxiety... NOT depression.  Dont give up be your own advocate in this.  If your doctor doesnt hear you and talk to you about PTSDanxiety about your birth experience then find a group that does deal with that.  I really wish I had been more proactive as it took me almost  months to get help because all the medical professionals kept spouting crap about depression when my problem was I was having panic attacks at the thought of leaving my house.,beyondthebump,dbo0uwx,2,t5_2u06v

Near  months it started to become more frequent as I think he was just becoming emotionally dependent on breastfeeding through the night.Finally after moving into our new house and settling in when he was around  months I had had enough. We did the CIO method. At first we would check up on him and continue extending the time. We soon realized that made him cry harder because he was that much closer to getting what he wanted wanted but did not need. We then decided to just let him cry for roughly  minutes to half an hour. He then slept through the night and we have barely looked back since.Hes going to turn  in a few weeks and he sleeps from  pm until  am.

10198903,0,t3_5m1huy,We cloth diaper so I cant speak to the question about diapers and wipes. However I was planning to breastfeed and ended up not being able to and I wish Id been a little more prepared for the cost of formula feeding. We have to use Dr. Browns bottles due to LOs latch and gas issues so that was an unexpected cost. I think we got a set of  bottles for  or so so around  a piece. We bought more than  obviously but you might do some research on the cost of different types of bottles and budget X amount per bottle based on how many you think youll want. Also my LO has a sensitive tummy and the store brand formula made him constipated SO SAD because its so much cheaper so were stuck using Similac Sensitive. Hes  weeks eating between  oz a day and a  can of formula lasts him about a week. Unfortunately that cost will only go up as he gets older but itll drop again once we introduce solids. You might want to set aside some money for those random things you cant anticipate your LO will need. For example we bought several Halo swaddles but it turns out my LO can bust out of them so we had to buy some swaddle pods and a woombie instead. We didnt think wed need a mobile but my guy is super into watching things move and he doesnt like to be set down unless he has something interesting to look at so I ended up spending about  on two different mobilesmotion based toys for him this week. My last piece of advice would be to buy as much as you can from Target. As long as the item came from target you can return it even if you dont have a receipt and theyll give you the money back on a gift card. This was super helpful for us when we needed to return the avent bottles we bought and get the Dr. Browns instead stuff like that. ,beyondthebump,dc03p9x,1,t5_2u06v

10267107,0,t3_5mzuii,I have a .mo son who has never been a great sleeper. Hes been sleeping in his crib since about one month he was so loud at night we couldnt cosleep and was really hard to put down and woke every hour or so to nurse. This continued until he was about  months old.I agree with the comments that the whole STTN thing is not normal for a baby and they need us at night. However it was taking over an hour and a half to put him down and even nursing to sleep wasnt working. Plus waking every hour while working full time just about killed me. So we decided to do some gentle sleep nudging. We started with a solid nighttime routine for  weeks. Then on night  of training i put a chair next to the crib laid him down and let him cry. I offered reassuring touch and repeated a mantra time for sleep now mommy loves you which we say to him every time we put him down. He cried . hours that night  mins the next and about  mins for the next few weeks. Every  nights you move the chair away from the crib until you are out of the room. Not going to lie it sucked. BUT i was in the room and knew he was ok he didnt have to feel abandoned and the results have been great. He now goes right to sleep anytime I lay him in his crib. He also puts himself back to sleep if he wakes at night not during one of our predetermined feedings so Im getting up a LOT less. Its not perfect and Im still really tired but sharing this so you can see that it doesnt have to be all or none and there are many ways to work on sleep.

I didnt develop good friendships until I was an adult my cousins all lived really far away and I had no neighbors with kids.  I wouldve been terribly lonely and Im very grateful for my siblings.  I think having an only child can be way more successful with the right opportunities.  Like getting them involved and social very young.  Whether its Sunday School tball dance karate whatever is available so they can make friends and learn how to nurture friendships.

So take this with a grain of salt and dont stress if your baby doesnt follow the same path. Bottle Within his first few hours of life. He was a preemie and was taken to the NICU immediately after birth where they fed him a mix of formula and what little breast milk I was able to produce. Hes never taken anything but a bottle so Im not much help here. Pacifier Around a month old I think. He loved that thing up until he was  months and then he just dropped it. He doesnt take it anymore and prefers chewing on toys clothes his hands and anything you put within reach lolTummy time probably around  months. Swaddling We didnt so much wean him off as he just got too big for his swaddle blankets lol It became very clear to us that at a certain point swaddling him did not calm him anymore so that also gave us a clue to stop using the swaddles. Sleep train havent started to purposely sleep train LO is almost  months but starting at around  months we made a point to put him down on his crib when he was sleepy but not asleep. Hell toss and turn fuss a bit sometimes but he usually falls asleep on his own within  min. Husband and I have slightly different techniques I like to rock him until hes almost fading into sleep and then put him down husband just puts him down when he shows signs of being sleepy rubbing eyes fussing etc. Idk if this counts as sleep training but this has been working wonders for us. LO has a pretty good grasp on how to self soothe and put himself to sleep now.

10541059,0,t3_5qwkwb,You need to be flexible. And you need to be prepared. Be prepared not to be able to breastfeed. Be prepared to exclusively pump. Be prepared for food allergies. Be prepared to give up and formulabottlefeed. Be prepared to have a baby who will never ever want to be put down so invest in a good baby carrier. Be prepared for a baby who may have reflux or colic and will cry a lot. But also be prepared for a baby who has none of these issues and sleeps normally for a baby in  hour intervals after being fed and changed. Be prepared for a baby who sleeps through the night from the get go. Or at  weeks. But be prepared for a baby who will sleep through the night for the first time at  months. Be prepared to have a normal birth a second degree tear and for the typical six weeks of postpartum healing. Which looks like  a lot of pain when you sit down but minimal to no discomfort when standing up. If this is the case for you youll probably be able to be out and able the second or third day after giving birth. If you have a bigger tear it may take you a few more days of rest  but as I said the worse is sitting down. But. Be prepared for complications postpartum. My friend went back to the hospital  week later her placenta had partially stayed attached and she was bleeding out. And. Be prepared for a Csection. In which case youll probably be lying down a lot more in the first weeks and youll feel pain at the incision site vs. down there.Or maybe youll be like my stepmom who birthed three kids without tearing in  minutes of pushing tops and the worst she experienced were a few hemorrhoids. Bottom line is. You may need  week. Three months. Each person is different. But what I do know is Ive seen a lot of women with no maternity leave and theyre warriors. They made it work. You get to bring baby to work  so thats great. You can breastfeed in front of customers and do so in a conservative manner if you want. Bring a bouncing chair and a rock and play to work. Itll be great to have baby with you to spend time with  I thought personally that the worst part of having no maternity leave was being SEPARATED from your baby at such a young age. So let that be your silver lining  cus IMO its a huge blessing to be able to spend that time with your baby in the early months. edit just a random FYI  but bottlefed babies clusterfeed too. It used to seriously irk me when my breastfeeding friends would complain they were up all night because growth spurts  cluster feeding like my daughter was exempt from growth spurts because she was bottlefed. ,beyondthebump,dd2y30j,8,t5_2u06v

10567033,0,t3_5ra4ve,I just wanted to say that some of what youre feeling Ive felt as a mother too.  We couldnt breastfeed after  days so I switched to pumping.  My husband was home with us for  weeks and then we both went back to work but my husband was able to stay home with her one day per week.  The bond they have is enviable.  I have a different bond with her but its not from the feeding aspect.  But every day I look for reassurances from her that Im doing a good job and shes  months old.  I can tell she is growing fast  she loves us dearly as we do her.  But those first  weeks were so hard because I hardly felt like I knew what I was doing and even though my husband didnt either for some reason he was more sure of himself.I have made it one of my goals to trust my intuition more often.  My husband has even said its usually spot on.  But I think the feeling of am I doing this right? Is a big cause for the perception of a weaker bond.

10590756,0,t1_dd8b7zy,Lol that sounds familiar. So I highly recommend reading ferbers bookit has a ton of great info on baby sleep. I also enjoyed reading bringing up bebe for some good perspective. I did a bunch of things Decided baby had sleep phase delay Ferber describes this. Basically she was going to sleep for good for the night too late and waking too late. I started shifting everything earlier by  minday.  Decided baby needed to learn to self sooth so if she woke up she could put herself back to sleep Ferber describes this too and bringing up bebe gives info here as well. This would also cut back the literal hours I was spending rocking her and singing lullabies.  Started putting her down drowsy but awake. If she genuinely cried and wasnt calming I went to her comforted her etc. But if it was low level crying or grumbling I let her do it. First day putting down drowsy but awake only worked for one nap and she lowlevel cried for  min. Second day it worked for half her naps and she would low level cry for maybe  min. Since the third day Ive been able to put her down drowsy but awake for almost all naps and bedtimes. Usually shell cry maybe  minutes if at all grumble for a few minutes then shes out. I changed bedtime routine. Now the routine is the same for all naps and nighttime. Books boob if necessary usually try to nurse her earlier change diaper bounce on yoga ball and sing  lullabies bounce a few additional minutes if necessary so baby gets to where her eyes are closing put her down drowsy but awake. I added the phrase its sleepytime now. Its time to go to sleep. I say it when were finishing up with the books and repeat it a bazillion times as were getting ready for sleep. My theory is that shell be happier if she knows whats happening and shell learn to connect the phrase with going to ved pretty quickly she already knows the phrase are you a hungry girl and gets excited when I say it lol Let me know if you have any questions.

Also the baby hates the smell on her so it sort of helped make her realize it wasnt the best idea to smoke a bunch and then hold him.At her house we kept him on blankets we brought and only on our blankets. When he wasnt on those I had him in the carrier on me. Hes walking now and Im dreading visiting her house again because Im not sure how to handle it.

10624947,0,t3_5s1gha,I think you have a right to not want the baby calling someone else by the same name they use for you omma. Youre the mum you get to have your own special name. However I think if you acknowledge that your own names from the baby are important you should really do the same for them. Your MIL has agreed to make what amounts to a sacrifice for her whether it actually is or not is debatable but thats obviously how she sees it and has chosen another nickname. Your husband should really respect that and make an effort to use that name.

10660746,0,t3_5sj6p1,Yes it gets better!  months is tough especially when they start to get into this mom only Velcro phase. But I also agree that this might not be a normal amount of stress and really would encourage you to talk to your  OB or primary care doc about PPD. I have struggled with PPD with baby number two and it really does feel like every single little thing is just too much to handle. It still feels like that sometimes but it is certainly better. But as far as things not going right you have so many things going right for you! You have a happy healthy baby after a scary entrance into the world! You are still breastfeeding her long after most would have given up because it was too hard thats awesome! You have a partner who is involved and willing to help! It gets better. Many of us have been there and felt exactly the same way. You are an awesome mom ,beyondthebump,ddfkph6,4,t5_2u06v

10679836,0,t3_5ssthd, months was I think still  naps for us! A three month old cant be awake long enough for    schedule. We started it when my daughter was  months modified for a third nap. She started fighting me tooth and nail over the last nap only recently.  months was still napping every . hours awake  hours before bed rockingbouncing to sleep. We still swaddled and I think she slept in the rock n play she grew out of it pretty quickly after though then we moved her to her bassinet. Blackout curtains white noise fan to move air. She slept anywhere from . hours   minutes. Sometimes she just napped on the nursing pillow in my lap. Its only for a little bit! Babys so little and needs lots of sleep! Eta if she woke up after  minutes Id generally get her and start the nap clock again with the expectation that this awake round would be shorter. In hindsight I think I should have waited  or so minutes before I went to get her in case she fell back asleep but perhaps that skill came later anyway.  months is when they start discovering the world and sleep suffers a little sometimes from the distraction. Im a sahm too and honestly I could use a break but I always ask myself what better way to spend my time at home really than to really cater to babys needs. ,beyondthebump,ddhjlk2,2,t5_2u06v

It started out with just a few times a night but I always got that long stretch at the beginning. No big deal. Then it got worse. And then it got worse. And then I ended up with a baby who would wake at every single sleep cycle to cry for me. I was up at least every hour for two weeks. It was horrendous. I wish I hadnt taken the quick fix. I ended up having to take a more aggressive form of sleep training that I wish I didnt have to do. It would have been much easier to not even let those habits form.

10732700,0,t3_5tiyat,My read on the situationNo schedule generally for about  months. Lots of people have about  hour intervals of feeding and sleeping . Listen to your baby and roll with it.Around  mo lots of people start trying out nap and bedtime routines. Youll start to see a pattern when your baby is done for the night and that starts to establish a bedtime. mo things get much more patterned. Bedtime for a lot of babies is around pm. Babies probably have  daytime naps. They might still wake up  times a night for feedings. mo many babies start sleeping through the night but also many dont. mo baby drops to  naps mo baby drops to  nap?? Were not there yet...This is all general and depends on your babys personality and your parenting style!

I have a dog that needs to be groomed and has a severe and immediate flea allergy.

This is a once a month thing that takes a few moments so its not that big of a deal plus I have one pet to take care of. If it was just a matter of not being able to dote on the pets as much as she used to it would be one thing animals adapt and once your baby becomes more independent youll have more time for other things but this is a health concern akin to making sure an animal that needs medication to prevent seizures gets that medicine. ,beyondthebump,de43qlu,2,t5_2u06v

11008804,0,t3_5x47ik,I see that you have gotten a shower! So that is great. Now onto your husband. Ive read  things on this sub that I think would help you in this situation. . He isnt helping you take care of the baby he is just taking care of the baby since he is a parent too. . Does he consider what you are doing a job? If his answer is yes then you also need a break and he gets to spend time with his child. If his answer is no then him taking the baby isnt work and you still get your break! My husband and I both work so I dont have experience as a SAHM other than maternity leave but my husband and I dont do personal activities while the baby is awake unless its been arranged prior. So when baby is awake we are either playing with her cleaning making dinner errands or family outings. Granted since we both work we dont get much time with her so this arrangement works great for us! But its time to sit down and come up with some rulesguidelines. You need a break. Your husband could do bath and bedtime which would give you time to yourself alone everyday. Good luck! and remember you both are the parents and it takes practice. ,beyondthebump,deftfif,3,t5_2u06v
11011181,0,t3_5x47ik,Ignore his sighs. Every night when the baby is fed hand him HIS CHILD and tell him not to bother you for an hour. Shower leave the house go for a walk watch TV read a book paint your nails sit alone in silence take a nap etc. Do it every day. Dont let him act like its some giant burden. If you want to be nice give him  mins after he gets home to let him decompress from his day before you take your hour but make sure you take it. You might also put him in charge of bed time or bathtime. Bedtime can be tricky if baby is breastfeeding but he can still put on PJs and read a story. His involvement in parenting isnt negotiable. Dont make it so.,beyondthebump,deg34sg,4,t5_2u06v

Like you I want her to get a variety but also eat a decent amount without allowing her to refuse new things in order to get her favorites bad habit building.So far Ive had the best luck with offering her some of this some of that then some of this again. For example she loves drinking from her sippy cup she just lets the water dribble out of her mouth most the time so I give her that. Then I take it away and give her some green beans. When shes eaten or otherwise destroyed those I give her back the sippy. Then repeat. Or I do this with mum mums and fruit mine also doesnt really like fruit.Im also still trying to experiment with different media.

My sons schedule gets messed up when hes in a different place though if your son is going there once a week maybe thats not it. He could be refusing the bottle and naps out of excitement. If you dont think thats it I think the first thing Id do is try explaining the importance of his schedule to your MIL. She sounds great so maybe she just doesnt understand maybe your husband also needs to understand the importance of a toddler sticking to his schedule!. If that doesnt work and its not having a negative impact on your son I think Id try to let it go. Easier said than done I know! My inlaws broke a few of my rules when my son was younger screens and juice but I decided that their help was important enough that I should not fight those battles and just let him get slightly spoiled at their house once a month or so.

11140052,0,t3_5yw82i,I forgot to mention that spacing kids apart more makes a huge difference. It seems like in our society most people go for a . year spacing. But my husband and I were  years apart from our siblings and very close with them so we couldnt phathom a less than  year age difference. For me physically my first was very heavy and loved being carried. She also loved sleeping in a crib. So I knew there was no way I could hack pregnancy again before she was at least  years old and moving more independently.As it turned out I finally got pregnant a few days before she turned . Its worked out beautifully especially with this being a twin pregnancy which has been even more physically demanding. From day  I stopped carrying her and I have no need to she can climb into her own carseat go up and down the stairs on her own  etc. We potty trained the same day I got the positive test so no more awkwardly wrestling her for diaper changes. She was still in a crib so a few months later we transitioned her to toddler bed so I wouldnt have to lift her. She can get dressedbrush teeth with minimal assistance. She can climb into her own boostet seat to eat and get her own snacks and drinks if theyre on a low enough shelf. Shes been able to help me with chores that I cant do because they require bending like sorting the laundry from the dryer and unloading the dishwasher.

11174319,0,t3_5zep7p,My husband works from home. He took the first week off and then half days here and there when our son was a newborn. So he was working most of the time but was still very available.I didnt really experience any of those stereotypical things. I was able to take a shower every day eat normal food not just bags of chips etc. Neither of us slept much Im breastfeeding so theres no night off for me! but he took care of diapers I only had to nurse at night and didnt have to get out of bed. So it was doable the sleep deprivation wasnt extreme.I did have a few rough days but they were mostly my fault when I stubbornly refused to ask him for help or got freaked out by things I read online sleep stuff mostly. All in all we had a much more pleasant newborn phase than what is usually described. I cried maybe twice a month instead of every day.In my experience taking care of a baby is relatively easy as long as youre doing only that but taking care of a baby and trying to do stuff at the same time will have you pulling your hair out. Its really unpredictable on a bad day a round of laundry will take you all morning. On a good day baby will chill in their bouncer andor nap well and youll be able to get stuff done. So when there are two of you at home thats the part that really gets easier. One of you looks after the baby the other does stuff around the house or naps swap and continue.,beyondthebump,deylhmd,1,t5_2u06v

The longest he cried was  minutes and he only did that one night all the others were  or less and hes sleeping so much better. It took  days and now he goes down awake but drowsy with no tears. Our pediatrician thinks that if you feel your LO is ready starting early can be easier sometimes with CIO because they physically cant cry as long and also their sleep associations arent as deeply ingrained so theyre easier to break. I definitely think it depends on the baby though. My LO has been sucking his fingers to soothe for a while now had more than doubled his birth weight and has been able to put himself to sleep for naps for a month or so so we figured he was ready. ,beyondthebump,deylwgc,2,t5_2u06v

11199945,0,t3_5zvuwa,Theres virtually no science to support the idea that its better to wait until  months vs. introducing when baby is ready in the  month window.  Some reading...However from a public health messaging standpoint there are some reasons to say  months which is probably why AAP and many other major health orgs have drawn that line.  People are always going to start before the guideline so saying  months makes it more likely that people are going to start between  vs  which science supports is too early.  Saying  months also extends breastfeeding which is a goal that many public health orgs have.  People feed their babies junk fill them up on juice etc. so delaying that as long as possible is good.  And there arent that many drawbacks to starting at  months vs.  so its a safe way to reduce risk.We started at  months.,beyondthebump,df1i0fh,24,t5_2u06v

11334775,0,t1_dfgezdi,Im not a huge fan of soy milk unless its absolutely necessary for a true milk allergy. If youre going to try mixing gentlease then it completely nullifies the purpose of using soy. I would try one of two things. . Get the enfamil ar. If she still projectile vomits it then I would instead try . Adding a teaspoon of rice cereal to every  ounces of soy formula. I know there are a ton of people that will say dont start cereal yet but it works and in that small of an amount its just a thickener and it will satisfy her more. Both these options might cause some constipation so be on the look out. Thats why I mix half and half with gentlease in the daytime. If he gets too bunged up I use a rectal thermometer with vasoline and swirl it around a little and usually it lets out some farts right away followed by a stream of poo sometimes its not immediately but be prepared Just in case.The podster is for lounging and sleeping. I use it to bedsharecosleep when my son refuses to go back in his bed and its am. My kid hates being in his swing. He always wants to be held and the podster snuggles them tighter like they are in your arms. Keep it in mind if the rock and play just isnt doing the job anymore. Its convenient to move around the house and he seems to love it.Also make sure youre keeping baby upright after feeding for like  mins.

Now if neither you nor your husband drank significant amounts of milk as children and neither of your are lactose intolerant as adults then that consideration may not be that important to you. My husbands family has a tendency toward it  I dont know about mine because we always drank our milk until we were in our mid teens at least.  edit to add my kid is defintely not addicted  shes actually the opposite I blame extended BF for that.

First off my husband is very tall and quite thin.  He also has a very low drive to eat.  So low in fact that accidentally he starved himself once.  Its possible that either my baby is just super skinny or has a low eating drive.  I also just measured my baby while she slept.  Shes somewhere between  and . inches.  If you look on the growth charts thats almost offthe charts tall.  So its possible that her alarming weight is due to having just completed a crazy growth spurt.Also I just finished off a huge work project.  Im a work from home mom.  When Im working long hours I frequently do not eat or drink as much as I ought to.  I also recently lost a couple pounds.  Its possible that the stress from one or the other has lowered my milk supply.  I am going to push the fluids from now on.We gave our girl a few spoonfuls of apple sauce yesterday.  She loved it!

She was waking more like three times a night and I found that at least one of those wakings usually the first which was around  she was only eating on one side. I started having my husband go in and rock her instead since it seemed to be more about comfort than food. After maybe a week she mostly dropped that waking. Last night for example she went to bed around  woke up at   and was up for the day around . Is having someone else go in to soothe him an option for you?Anyway have you sleep trained for bedtime?

Ive left milk out at room temperature for longer than  hours almost every time Ive pumped for last  months. Some days my milk has been room temp for closer to  hours. My LC uses the  hoursdaysmonths guideline as do a few of my mom friends who are also nurses. My LC also recommends smelling and tasting your milk and at least offering it to baby instead of just throwing it away.

And presto all done. But then I lift her from the tub place her gently in her special bath towel with the funny rabbit ears lovingly pat her skin dry and carry her to the changing table. I snap back to reality when I unwrap my angelic daughter and find shes crapped in the towel and its now all over her and Im going to have to bathe her all over again.

I think cute dresses are fun and my daughter has worn every dress shes been given for some part of the day except those dry clean only ones.  But I HATE the back buttons.  And my daughter seems to have the biggest shoulders ever so she outgrows dresses before almost anything else.I finally bought her a  mo dress shes in  mo now that just pulls over her head.  Wash and wear.  Its got stretch searsucker in the back.  Why arent all dresses made with either neck snaps or snaps or elastic?,beyondthebump,dgqmrxu,1,t5_2u06v

11749816,0,t1_dgqspsj,Oh Mary Mack Mack Mack. There is hope and I never would have believed you if youd told me that at  months or  months or  months even.  But here is our story.   My daughter was a big baby lb oz at birth and everyone told me big babies sleep better well thats BS! Then they told me once she starts eating solids shell sleep better BS! Once she can turn over shell sleep better BS!  I could go on and on. She outgrew her bassinet at  months so we went to an arms reach cosleeper she outgrew that at  months so we had to move her to her crib.   She was still waking up every  hours all night long.  She had reflux and at that point pretty much constant ear infections.  She was breastfed and we nursed to sleep and pretty much had to be nursed back to sleep when she woke up.  Around a year we started moving to whole milk at daycare I was so done pumping at work and at about  months the vomiting started. So not just waking up every couple hours to nurse but also cleaning up vomit.  at  months we took her off dairy doctor orders and we decided to wean her at the same time. Weaning was not nearly as bad as I had anticipated it being.  Within a few days she had stopped vomiting.  Within a week or so she was sleeping longer stretches through the night by a month out she was sleeping through the night  of the time knock wood.  We had a few bad nights when she got sick and I expect that to happen but now we have a normal bedtime routine and I put her in her crib awake and she goes to sleep on her own something I never in my wildest dreams thought would happen.  So for us it was part health unknown dairy allergy part reliance on breastfeeding part lack of routine part maturity on her part.  I think the transition to the toddler room at daycare with lots of active play and one long nap helped a lot too my kid needs the structure of a pretty rigid schedule.   I hope some of this helps. Hang in there! ,beyondthebump,dgrvd9u,2,t5_2u06v

11791732,0,t3_686cy0,I had a diaper shower instead of a traditional baby shower and I didnt know what brands  sizes I would want so weve tried all sorts of diapers.  Heres my adviceLike everyone else had said a lot of what brand is the best will have to do with your infants body type.Cheaper brands like Luvs are not as leak proofI wish that wasnt true but it just is what it is.  Target brand is the best of the cheap brands IMO.More expensive organic sort of brands like Honest have been no better at preventing diaper rash stopping leaks etc.Your baby may never be able to fit in Newborn size.The weight size on the diaper is misleading if your baby is super long.  According to the weight size we shouldnt have needed newborn diapers but my baby was in NBs for about a month because he is  for length and only like  for weight.I dont think theres any advantage to stocking up unless you are having a diaper showerthere are so many places to get great deals on diapers online and shipping is so fast that other than about  weeks worth of diapers I wouldnt worry about it.,beyondthebump,dgwms7u,1,t5_2u06v

11801560,0,t1_dgx0on3,It was similar with my inlaws. The only clash was with the drinking cold water thing but at some point MIL noticed Id been keeping my water bottle on the bedroom window ledge winter so caved in and left my pitcher in the fridge.Edit to add  not Asian so the no hair washing thing was not part of it though no hot showers was even to the extent the doctor said it too. I just didnt tell them the temp of the shower. DH knew and got worried but I explained it was probably just a blood lossblood pressure fainting concern and that Id compromise by keeping a stool in there. I dont know how he figured Id have the control to sit on it if I did pass out but it was enough of a thought placebo for him to let it go.,beyondthebump,dgxqxgg,6,t5_2u06v
