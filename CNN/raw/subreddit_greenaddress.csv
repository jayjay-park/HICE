1185352,0,t3_27npk9,I believe what happens here is that gait sends the transaction first to a private wallet of sorts the passphrase of which you sent to the Facebook user. When they create an account gait then sends the funds to their newly created HD wallet.There are two fees paid because there are two transactions. THis is necessary because the recipients address was not known when you sent the funds.It should be made more clear that this will happen but as far as I can figure its the only way to do it  and the two fees together total something like . USD so its not prohibitively expensive.,greenaddress,ci2yyrs,3,t5_2xxwy

Then use filerecovery menu to create the greenaddress of wallet. I dont think that people will be happy after trying to understand what is the reason for such behavior.      ,greenaddress,cndf8oi,1,t5_2xxwy
