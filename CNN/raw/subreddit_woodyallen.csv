9174260,0,t3_55rjai,I thought it was a little underwhelming especially the end of the whole series. I really couldnt bring myself to enjoy Miley Cyruss performance which was a little off on comic timing and she didnt seem too invested in all the sanctimonious stuff she was saying either. Elaine Mays performance however was very funny. The giant farce in the final episode where the Munsingers entire social circle spills into their house was very delightful and the zany radicalized geriatric white lady book club is quite quintessentially Woody Allen. ,woodyallen,d8ewlbl,3,t5_2rwfr
