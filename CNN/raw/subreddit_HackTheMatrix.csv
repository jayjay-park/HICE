2773205,0,t1_cnjau62,Ah you are talking about false awakenings. Yes Im very familiar with those. Like familiar to the point of having  of them in a row.In terms of dreaming physically theres no difference. A dream within a dream inception isnt really layered. Similarly a waking up inside a waking up isnt really layered.But it begs the question can we wake up from reality? Will it be like waking up from a dream?In dreams if you die you wake up. General rule of thumb. Is this also true of reality? How many dream rules carry over?,HackTheMatrix,cnjax8q,0,t5_35rru
