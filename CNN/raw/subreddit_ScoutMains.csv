7363242,0,t3_4g75i2,i actually started off with noob classes like engie and pyro predictably when i started playing... but honestly i switched to scout pretty much because as a character hes hilarious and charismatic in a dickish sort of way and the incredible mobility allows for so much room to dick around and improve on the weirdest tactics. cant say im a sweaty tryhard but even being pretty bad scout is such a fun class to learn to improve on without it feeling boring or like a chore.,ScoutMains,d2f5f3d,1,t5_3bh40
