1461833,0,t3_2atviu,I wouldnt lick the hedgie if I were you!On a serious note I would suggest giving him a few days to feel comfortable before trying to handle him too much. And check if your sister left him some treats. ,Hedgehogs,cizilne,2,t5_2tbj0

2830978,0,t3_2sgstu,Just how hard are those spikes? I suppose they gotta be somewhat bendable or they would hurt like heck to give birth to...Ive been wondering for years if they were even born with those  seemed like an appropriate place to ask stuff D,Hedgehogs,cnpvlet,3,t5_2tbj0
2895982,0,t1_cnx8l0v,I wish I could offer you more help. Henrietta is positively darling and I do believe shes a testament to how happy a life a WHS afflicted hedgie can live. Youve done wonderfully with her and if it is a UTI then you should be able to help clear it up fairly easily. ,Hedgehogs,cnx9zu1,2,t5_2tbj0
4722974,0,t3_3fiqou,Samus Harley...  I had a bunch of names picked when I was getting my hedgehog. I think arthus was one God I had like ten names. I pick him up take one look at him every name gone. I named him Pixel because hes a multi coloured hedgie. Youll find the perfect name once you meet her! ,Hedgehogs,ctpvcal,1,t5_2tbj0

7460384,0,t1_d2putjf,Thanks for your help! I will try to show my full hand so she wont get confused. This is my first hedgehog and I dont really know anyone else with one so I just wanted to make sure that I was doing everything right.,Hedgehogs,d2q76h5,2,t5_2tbj0

11551920,0,t3_64vck2,Ive read about it before and going off of that its not healthy to have the hedgie awake all day everyday as it disrupts their natural cycle. Also socializing a hedgie isnt  a bad thing but the little ones definitely enjoy their alone time to eat mealies run on their wheels etc. I honestly think that youre better off adopting something else going off of what you mentioned. ,Hedgehogs,dg5ewae,2,t5_2tbj0
