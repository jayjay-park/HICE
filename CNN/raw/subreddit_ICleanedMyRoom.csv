4105545,0,t1_cro8o8f,Ouch xD after. I like a bit of organized clutter if that makes sense. It looks better in person I apologize for the potatopicture  Also I have three fish tanks a terrarium and a double Ferret Nation in there so I have to work around those on top of already having limited space. ,ICleanedMyRoom,cro9965,4,t5_2y1ce
