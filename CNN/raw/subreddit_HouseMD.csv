690580,0,t1_cgimwju,I really like your idea of one thread per week. But do you think  episodes might be a bit much?Maybe it would make sense to start off a little slower  say  or . After a while we could reexamine the pace and speed it up if it looks like theres interest. That way we wouldnt scare anyone off and we can see if one thread can handle multiple episodes without getting too cluttered.Very excited for this!,HouseMD,cgirrm9,2,t5_2rc0x
770099,0,t3_22yt37,I see what youre saying but dont we all do that? You are willing to tell a stranger something youd never tell your friends about because you dont trust them or its not in the right circumstance. Cameron didnt tell House because she didnt trust him with the information at that time. Later on she tells everybody anyway. She told a patient that story to make them feel better. They point out Foremans hypocrisies HEAVY later on in the show too. I dont think its a character flaw because everyone lies and everyones a hypocrite to a point anyways. ,HouseMD,cgrtci9,6,t5_2rc0x

He finally tells her after she pesters him and accuses him of an affair. And she responds by ultimately divorcing him. When in that Dibella episode she said he deserved to die.

4114184,0,t3_37r9ce,Hey man glad you liked the show welcome to the sub. House gave me a new appreciation and interest in the medical field as well. As far as shows like House its tough. This is my favorite show of all time so nothing really stacks up but I do have two recommendations that might help you fill the void a bit. If you like gruff intelligent complicated egotistical main characters check out Lie to Me  seasons ran from  to . Stars Tim Roth as an expert in lie detection facial giveaways body language words etc who helps the FBI. Its informative and entertaining. Plus Roth is British so theres that link too. The writing isnt as strong as House and its doesnt really have the same emotional impact but it has similarities. Another would be the BBC version of Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. If you know anything about Greg House you know his character was directly based off of Sherlock Holmes HolmesHouse WatsonWilson apartment B etc etc. BBCs Sherlock is my favorite interpretation and Cumberbatch nails it. Very clever and interesting. These arent medical in any way of course but they do share character and tone similarities to House M.D.. They both used to be available on Netflix streaming U.S. although I cant speak to that currently. ,HouseMD,crp8r22,8,t5_2rc0x

Thats one of those little tiny details that Hugh Laurie wanted and he wanted something that he had made in prisonsomething he continues to wear.
