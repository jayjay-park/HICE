54608,1,t1_cekmo5x,Poverty is inbuilt into capitalism and cant be fixed without implementing an alternative economic system.  The path toward both battling poverty in this system and implementing another lies in mass movements from below.  The posted articles examples of occupywallstreet and fightfor are great examples.  Seattle is a great example of how this works.  Occupy built networks that has changed the dialogue in that city and now whole neighborhoods seatac have a hr minimum wage and a socialist on the city council.  That is a recipe for obtaining a better standard of living for all workers and lowering inequality.,rva,ceknax7,3,t5_2qpvj

110622,0,t1_ceqt1i6,Fair.My main problem with your reasoning is that because Lawyerscourts dont understand computers you appear to be making the point that nothing should be done about what seems to me a legitimate problem. A problem that technologists should be concerned about because it involves one of the worst aspects of internet culture. Blackmailing people because they disseminated intimate pictures of themselves and then a third party is profiting by threatening to drag down their reputation. Id say thats a pretty legitimate problem and if the counterargument is well it COULD be a slippery slope! then thats not much of a rebuttal.  The longer this sort of stuff persists on the internet the more it will give power to those you deem ignorant of your area of expertise. ,rva,cer0zir,3,t5_2qpvj

I was raised in the s but old enough to remember how bad crime was so when people talk about how bad it is now I gently remind them that crime overall is down compared to what it was. As for crime around VCU I was a student and now am Adjunct faculty and what you have is a lot of people from elsewhere who see Richmond as a sleepy little town where no crime can possibly occur. These are the individuals who are the victims of crime most likely because they are not aware of their surroundings and think they are immune to crime or that Richmond isnt big enough to have bad crime. I tell all my students to be aware of their surroundings as I teach at night and class doesnt end until about pm. Also students and people not from Richmond dont know the historicallycurrently bad neighborhoods. I get the VCU crime reports and its constantly stuff like person was walking through alley at am or was in the Randolph neighborhood or walking down Chamberlayne at am.

838256,0,t1_cgzedbu,I read your original comment and held off on replying figuring that you had some very valid reasons for your response.  Whats sticking with me is your last part of your commentgt Frankly for anyone with children anyone elderly or for women who wont have a strong man in the house Id recommend the area around MacArthur rather than Battery Park.Yeah thats whats getting to me. My wife and I have lived in some real shit holes in this city my wife more than I. Be it Jackson Ward Churchill Oregon Hill parts of the lower fan  hell block parts of Upper Grace St  where the transtitutes AKA Decepticons roamed and alphabet blocks near . In all of these places we have experienced highs and lows but overall quite a lot of crime. I still to this day feel safest here in Battery Park than I have felt anywhere I have lived in this city. This isnt to say that the area doesnt have its issues but to warn off young families and the elderly I think is grossly misrepresenting the criminality in this neighborhood. Ill freely admit that I call the police on a semiregular basis for suspicious cars parked in front of the house and I have had my share of theft and vandalism. But it pales in comparison to what Ive dealt with in other i.e. Safer parts of this city. What really bothers me with your comment is that your admit to living in multiple locations in the area but by your own volition chose to stay here after all youve went through. And yet you claim that this neighborhood is not safe for anyone who isnt armed with firearms and canines and not for the elderly who are the majority of the population here and young families who are needed to maintain the neighborhood. By your reasoning Tina Turner needs to move next door and shout Welcome to Thunderdome! Which is no where near the reality. Maybe Ive lucked out on my quiet little section of the hood but I really dont think thats the case. Ive taken the time to compile the homicides in the surrounding area of the past few years here Im on my mobile so apologies if it doesnt turn out right but Im trying to show how few there have actually been around BP. Im not trying to minimize what you are saying but I am trying to bring a counter to what I find deeply reactionary feelings about a place that is in no way what my experience has been living here.  If nothing else see my comment as a neighbor who respectfully disagrees with you nothing more nothing less. EDIT My wife is none to happy about the strong male part of your comment bit Ill leave that up to her to reply to if she so chooses.

878859,0,t1_ch4606g,If youre interested in improving your whitewater skills in RVA on the James there are many options available. Chesterfield Parks and Recreation runs intro classes VCU also runs some whitewater trips and rents gear and I believe boats as well Riverside Outfitters also does instruction. There is also the Coastal Canoeist Club www.coastals.org. They have a great message board for Central VA whitewater boaters and do a lot of supervised runs not instruction. A club is a great way to find a whitewater mentor and get to know members of the Richmond whitewater community. Whether you should run pipeline is a complicated question but really comes down to a couple of factorsDo you own a whitewater kayak?How comfortable are you paddling Class IIIIV whitewater?  Can you roll?If youve only run the upper at low water levels youre probably not ready to run pipeline in my opinion. If you went with the right people who had paddled with you before and could show you down youd be more likely to succeed. Pipeline has some nasty rebar in places that can tear up a boat to say nothing of your body if you end up in the wrong places. I recommend checking out Coastals and try finding a group paddle on the upper you can tag along with and really get proficient practicing at ferrying eddying inout and improving boat control before you attempt the lower James. ,rva,ch46hfb,1,t5_2qpvj

You can go from delicious affordable dive to some of the most upscale delicious food from some rising stars in the restaurant scene typically all within a block or two of each other.If you like beer I recommend checking out any number of the breweries we have probably  or so in the Richmond area. Shockoe Bottom ShoBo as its come to be known on this sub will give you a typically more youthful club scene.  Uptown main street area will give you a little more depending on the bar classy option for fooddrink.If big box suburban feel is your thing you will want to find your way out to Short Pump Big open air mall whole foods trader joes all the big chains.

But anyway someone can look at this statue several ways. . This statue celebrates racism and now Im picturing all of the closeted racists an its having an emotional toll You.. This statue is part of the history of Richmond and shouldnt be forgotten extreme example as a holocaust memorial doesnt celebrate the holocaust. You get a white power boner racist people.

Maybe youve had some bad experiences but I would wager most people from RVA are a part of group  or . I guess my point is you can perceive almost anything as a negative and you can assume their are hordes of undercover racists and you can let those perceptions emotionally injure you but you dont have to.Unless of course you do have some sort of magical influence over peoples decision to be racist.

5039342,0,t1_cutdeyl,gt If you rear end someone else driving a car whose fault is it?Im gonna answer this question.  In a legal sense mine. But if that someone else merged into my lane with too little room between me and them and then immediately slowed down I am most likely going to hit them because there wasnt time to anticipate what came next. Legally it would still be my fault but Id think it unreasonable that everyone assume Im the idiot here when the other car did what it did. I find it discouraging that based on your comments in this thread you seem to believe that ALL accidents that happen are the entire fault of only ONE person. There are so many factors that go into collisions so many variables and as of right now none of us KNOW any facts beyond that the cops say the cars driver wasnt drunk or speeding and the biker was wearing a helmet. That is literally all we know from this article. I wish youd stop acting like you know everything there is to know about every possible collision scenario and particularly this one being that we know next to nothing. Im sure the driver feels shitty enough. Its not your job to make all drivers feel guilty for a bicyclists death. I dont think its necessary to jump down half the subreddits throats for suggesting that either or both parties could be at fault in an accident.

5064743,0,t1_cuwbks3,The thing about poverty is that it is also tied to a slew of other factors. On the biological side you have maternal prenatal and infant health along with environmental exposures like higher rates of chronic exposure to lead pain as a child all contributing to lower cognitive function and in the case of lead exposure increased aggression. Heres a newspaper article on the role lead paint played in Freddie Grays life. While not mitigating the fact that what happened to Freddie Gray was wrong it also shows why he was more likely to get in trouble with the police.Areas with concentrated poverty often suffer from worse schools less economic opportunity and increased gang activity all serving to shunt at least some children into street crime. So on the one hand we have developmental issues contributing to adolescents and adults that are for the lack of a better term vulnerable to social issues like gangs and other social pressures to criminality. And this happens in communities that have weak schools and ineffective or absent intervention programs. And none of these factors is such that every person in those conditions will have a  chance of becoming a murderer but they are enough to shift the bell curve such that these communities will experience more individuals turning to crime.I hope Im not butchering this response... Im pretty blurry from my dog waking me up barking because of the lightning and thunder. Youre right in that it isnt as simple as saying someone doesnt have money so they will become a violent criminal. But people in impoverished communities are more likely to be exposed to countless factors throughout their whole lives that contribute to individuals going down the path of crime.Anyhow I really recommend reading the Post article I linked about Freddie Gray and lead paint.,rva,cuwhrys,1,t5_2qpvj

Currently it is just a place where you go get your biscuits and leave obviously limited by space but also because its a breakfast place where people get stuff on their way to work. I think people are more willing to look for parking if they know they are going to stay somewhere to eat or drink for awhile. Several restaurants on that street in that exact stretch have recently changed ownership or moved. The Taphouse. Buddys moved.

Summers full of tourists the military is super prevalent traffic can be bad if you have to use to MonMer or HRBT but as a person who has been dividing summers going to Va Beach for  odd years there are some awesome things about it too. THE FUCKING BEACH. You expose yourself to so many more opportunities living at the beach than just visiting. Va Beach is full of great food if you know where to look.   The culture of Were the South Hear Us Roar doesnt really exist in Va Beach whether that bothers you or not.   The public schools arent bad. My cousins went to Cox they all turned out pretty well.   Neighboring Norfolk is not the shithole of violence that it once was.   Any property that you buy within  mile of the beach will appreciate. Guaranteed.

I want the whole city to raise its quality of life... especially the areas like Manchester that need it the most.  Sometimes building an identity for a neighborhood is the first step to having pride and attracting visitorsresidents.  If that works more money comes in raising the tax base to provide better services to the whole city and attracting more residents and businesses.  Its not a foolproof plan but its a start.A better Richmond doesnt happen on its own.  It starts with people caring beyond their doorstep their block and their neighborhood.  ,rva,d0qxv5g,6,t5_2qpvj

Some great German food amp French classics The duck breast is out of this world. Check out date night  prix fixe for   courses  bottle of wine!In that same distance Proper Pie has amazing sweet pies and pretty good savory ones very reasonably priced. The seating is at a bar that separates you from the working kitchen very cool atmosphere.Id also say check out Foo Dog fusion asian in the opposite direction up Cary Street and Cask Cafe a very cool lowkey bar in a converted auto garage about . miles from you on Robinson near Cary Street. They have a great beer and wine list reasonable prices and serve great local sausagebratwurstetc and cheese boards.J Kogi is near you to the north its a delicious little spot with Korean bowls and a streetfood inspired menu.Youre also not far from Edos Squid which is near the VCU campus past Monroe Park its a nice walk. They are an Italian place on the second floor of a building kind of tucked away. I rarely eat Italian in restaurants but they really know what theyre doing the sauces are perfect amp Ive never had pasta that wasnt perfectly cooked.

I will say though when my gf  wife now  would get home from work late Id come down from my Apt and walk her in.

7417749,0,t3_4gwctd,Im a striker.... Verizon is stuck in contract negotiations with the unions on the east coast... We had been working with out a contract for the last  months due to Verizon wanting to outsource our clerical work to places such as India the Philippines Thailand Costa Rica and a few other third world countries so they can continue to pay slave labor salaries.They also want the option to be able to force our techs to work in any state up and down their whole east coast footprint for months at a time as if the majority of us dont have families we take care of and enjoy watching them grow.Verizon insists we take what theyre offering without even considering the effects it will have on our livelihoods... So we did what most unions hate doing and usually save as a last result... We walked.There are about  of us out on the street protesting Verizon central offices Verizon wireless stores and Verizon garages on the east coast.Verizon has quickly trained  employees to do our jobs in the mean while... They come from such departments as financing I.T. and a few mangers fresh out of college who have never worked a day in their life out in the field... They have been breaking telephone poles pulling down electrical wires and destroying customers homes both inside and out.I last heard new installs are about a month or two out and repairs are going on  weeks out... I heard this a few days ago so it may be longer at this point.As of today Verizon has offered a . increase over the life of our next contract which normally would sound good but whats the point of a . increase if were slated to lose about  of our yearly income due to them increasing what we pay into our medical and them cutting overtime. Theyll also be forcing us to choose between our jobs and our families.Sorry for being so long winded but I guess I just need to get this off my chest.,rva,d2lcm97,55,t5_2qpvj

But he keeps describing it in different ways and it makes banks extremely concerned that he wants to do some kind of organized default. I still dont know what he really means by that he mentioned it a couple times but AFAIK has not clarified it.I might not even disagree with him in theory but his spontaneous nature means that he doesnt present consistent policy.

If you do have a lease it may have its own termination agreement that you would go by. It is very common for reputable landlords to require  days notice or something for early termination instead of trying to collect months and months of rent from you.. If you have a lease and it either has no section covering early termination or the early termination seems way too severe it most likely defaults to the maximum allowed remedy for the landlord  which specifically says that they can collect rent from you for the duration of the lease until a new tenant is found.If I was you I would have posted that place on craigslist and offered to cover half of the first month or something.

8547650,0,t3_4wu9vf,Taught in RPS for  years. DONT DO IT. The schools dont have paper to make copies. There are no pencils tissues or lined paper. The desks are decrepit. The textbooks were written in . Some of the history classes still had maps with the USSR on them. Buildings are in awful shape. I taught at elkhardt for  weeks and was so sick I barely finished summer school because of the mold in the building. The administrators harass you if you dont do exactly what they say. The kids hit you and threaten you Ive had a desk thrown at me. You are not safe in those buildings. You are physically NOT SAFE. There is no school discipline the kids run the schools. No learning takes place in those buildings whatsoever. We had a dead rat in the bathroom for  days before the custodians did anything about it. I have personally dealt with  a student being stabbed in school  a student setting anothers hair on fire  a th grader grabbing a coworkers vagina and saying let me put a baby in there he wasnt suspended. They said her skirt was too short and enticed him and  a special needs student gaining access to the roof and threatening to jump. In th grade we considered students who read at a rd or th grade level as being on grade level. We had   year old th graders. You pick up such bad habits in the city. It took a whole year of me teaching in a real district to learn how to actually teach and not just be a prison warden that occasionally referenced grammar. Admin will NOT support you. If a child threatens you they will not take any action so as not to upset the parents. You are literally on your own from the minute you clock in til the minute you leave. They will fire you if you put your hands on a child in self defense my friend was fired after a boy hit her with a textbook and she tackled him. I too had the I want to help the most vulnerable wish but its not worth your mental health. I cried every day. I left and went to King George county and have never been happier. It is literally not worth it. Its much much MUCH worse than what people think. The kids arent the worst part you develop some strong friendships with them as their only positive adult role model so it is extremely rewarding but Im telling you from first hand experience it is literally a war zone. I often joked at least in Iraq Id have a fucking gun. Its bad OP. Real bad. If you choose RPS just know what youre getting yourself into. You will make a difference but at a very high price. TLDR dont work for RPS literally not worth your sanity and faith in humanity,rva,d6a10qh,33,t5_2qpvj

9063252,0,t1_d8173x0,Its supposed to be the actual cost of labor to produce the documents requested.  So  if its a single specific document  its not a big deal and might be free.  But more complicated requests can be fairly expensive into k.  For example  if you try to FOIA all records associated with procurement from Example Company  in the last  years it might cost a fair amount.  The records are probably not electronic  and items older than  years might be buried in an outside storage unit.  Then once they find it  they have to make sure there isnt anything in there that is exempt from FOIA. This isnt just to protect the state either.  In procurement for example  a contractor or manufacturer might bid on a job and  include lots of specific information about their process and their rate per hour  etc.  If that information is made public  it will be used against them in future negotiations with companies in the private sector. After all of that Then they make a copy and send it out. ,rva,d8198wh,0,t5_2qpvj

I wont lie there were times I hated meeting once a week especially hated getting up early on cold rainy Saturday mornings to go hiking and got very very homesick my first time at Boy Scout camp and I had been to other extended camps for weeks and had no problems. Im a St. Chris kid but was also a computer nerdhippie music listening kid who found his love of theatre because it got him out of after school sports but I still got along with everyone in the troop. All I suggest is if he does it try to make him stick with it. I was a step before Eagle and just wanted to take the easy road get out and not do my Eagle project and Ive very happy now my parents didnt let me do that.  ,rva,dcnk5nc,2,t5_2qpvj

My wife and I are trying to get from our house in CH to the Capital Club to work out around .. We knew it was raining pretty hard but who knew that Shockoe Bottom becomes occasional waterfront property. Coming down Main which is backed up as hell Im thinking whats up with all these assholes just a bit of rain I know a better way. So I turn south on th and thats when we noticed that there is a big fucking river running down Cary.Were watching cars float by when I ask my wife if she can tell if theres someone in that one. Were squinting trying to tell and think that there is. So we get out of the card and walk down to the waters edge. I wade out in my gym clothes in chest deep water to this car. Only thing I can think of is that Im going to step into a blown off manhole cover and disappear forever. I get to this guys car and get his door open. Sure enough hes in there but absolutely paralyzed just frozen. I reach over and unbuckle his belt and take his arm. He might have been previously motionless but at least hes pliant when Im getting him out.We wade back to shore where my wife has gone and grabbed some of the cooks from Sumo San and an ambulance is backing down the street. I turn this guy over to the EMTs and never hear from him again. Im sure he was fine nothing physically wrong with him just shock.The Sumo San guys and me run down the catwalk on the north side of Cary checking other cars for people. Finding none my wife and I headed home. Later that night we found people raiding bones from a collapsed St. Johns cemetery wall but thats for another time.,rva,de3z98t,6,t5_2qpvj

We could draw school districts in a way that makes sense to reduce bus costs. Why do buses destined for north side go to south side? Sell city owned lots and properties and thus start expanding the taxable base and cut the cost of maintaining empty lots.The city could expand its efforts to collect debts.Im sure you guys have some other ideas.Crucially rethink public housing!,rva,deme57r,2,t5_2qpvj

But unfortunately his supporters are just wrong on the causes as to why they are losing out on work.Your comments do explain some of the... enthusiasm? ... for him though. So thank you for that I guess.  Theyve illustrated that there is a fundamental disagreement on historical facts Im talking about causes of unemployment in the manufacturing sector in this case.   Also its absolutely not the let them eat cake solution.  Its the you can lead a horse to water... but cant make them drink solution.  Now that is condescending.  Its also not the only solution... but it is one of the ones people get stuck on.  ,rva,dgj48en,1,t5_2qpvj

11748914,0,t3_67nih6,The Homestead resort in Bath County is really nice and has warm springs to enjoy! This would probably put you closer to your budgetThe Acorn Inn in Nelson is also really nice and youre right off skyline drive so thats always fun. You can take that South and get some of the best pie in the state at Woodruffs Pie shop voted best apple pie in the South by Southern Living Magazine. This option would be cheaper than above more than likely. Nelson is great tons of pretty drives not far from Charlottesville if you want a fancier meal many wineries breweries and so forth Nationally award winning whiskey distillery with pretty vistas skyline drive is a great drive like I mentioned and theres plenty of short nice hikes if you all are up for that. On the shorter end of hikes Id recommend Cole Mountain off Rt.  in Amherst Spy Rock or just some hikes in the trails at the base of Wintergreen on the Rockfish River Valley trail system off Rt. . Oh and spring is just starting to get to the tops of the Blue Ridge so you can see the color creeping up the mountains right now which is always AWESOME to watch and youll see that best from either the tops of any of the hikes I mentioned or from Skyline Drive. Someone asked a similar question a year ago or so and they went to the Acorn Inn and had a grand time.,rva,dgrronl,7,t5_2qpvj

11758173,0,t3_67nih6,I suggest Middleburg. I grew up there. There is a good instant book Airbnb outside the town for under night. Excellent shopping and restaurants.
