3089625,0,t3_2vjph7,My personal rule of thumb is that if I can survive withut otc meds to make the cold better than I am cured and any sick excuses are null and void.   That means strict calorie counting and no slacking on exercise.  My only exception is for lower respiratory infections which I get rarely.  I go very easy on the cardio until Im at  because I have athsma and lower respiratory infections must be coddled or it becomes bronchitis  thus requiring a steroid a thing I try to avoid.  Generally calorie counting for me isnt an issue.  Whenever Im sick I pretty much live on tea and soup.  I always lose my appetite.  I never stop logging calories even when Im sick.So yeah if youre no longer counting the minutes until your next dose of cough syrup or Sudafed you have no reason to baby yourself and every reason to get your ass in gear.,ShitlordLife,coi8kt9,6,t5_36jnn
