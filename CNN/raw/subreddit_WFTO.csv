1638331,0,t3_2d14gq,I managed to get through the slightly broken menus to start the first level I couldnt read any of the buttons but I clicked the top one in each case and it worked out getting me to the tutorial.  The d bits work right but all the composited overlays take up what at first glance appears to be  the screen realestate in both dimensions topright corner,WFTO,cjlocug,1,t5_2t79x
1879572,0,t3_2g3ecy,Man I love that this game is being made but they definitely need to make it darker amp grittier. The lighting is way too bright and it completely lacks fog and shadows. I think its because I prefer DK over DK.Since its still in development does anybody know if these are the final graphics or if will they add some darkness?,WFTO,ckfojng,2,t5_2t79x

3601414,0,t3_31ckkp,It took me a couple tries but once I figured it out it doesnt seem so hard. First its important to expand extremely quickly. Youll want a Beast Pen Arena Barracks and Workshop down ASAP. Along with your usual LairSlaughterpenTavern Expand your dungeon to the corridor where the enemies will travel though and line it with your Garrison and Barracks and pile on cannons! You will run out of gold eventually so you need to blow up the brimstone to the north quickly to get the infinite gold vein. Its also important to dig out toward the corners and collect the Unidentified Artifacts. Among them are a global levelup and spirit workers.Before the first wave arrives I found it critical to build a Prison and Torture Chamber. You should be able to beat the first wave pretty handily with liberal use of the Thunderbolt spell but afterwards you will have to start converting them if you want to survive subsequent waves. By the time the second and further waves arrive you should have plenty of lv  converts to fight for you and it should be pretty trivial from there.,WFTO,cq2sc20,1,t5_2t79x
3608368,0,t1_cq35v8h,gt Id love to have that mechanic but I dont feel like the game as it stands would work with it.Thats a problem with the UI though and should be fixed. The button issue is also amplified by that horrible horrible cursor.I for one also really liked the WarlocksWizards wanting to be alone. If the map supported it and I had time I would almost build a seperate dungeon for them with their own small lair and hatchery. It gave them character in the sense that they werent just like every other minion. It also simply gives the gameplay a bit more depth.,WFTO,cq3kw6j,4,t5_2t79x
3616682,0,t3_31r0zl,Same here. My teammate claims the first room in the enemy base then just sits there until I win. I can play until I can see the fourth crystal then my game crashes. I even saved to reload it after it crashes and that doesnt work either it wont load.,WFTO,cq4j0di,2,t5_2t79x

4064897,0,t3_366f58,As a general guide  prop   unit. There are a few exceptions like youll usually have more cultists than props and less augres than garrison props but if you assume  prop   unit youll be close enough.,WFTO,crjmkw1,1,t5_2t79x
4231350,0,t3_39a8b3,Sooo with the new patch is WFTO worth buying yet? I pirated when it first came out and it was so buggy I havent played it since much less been willing to buy it. Its a game I very much WANT to like and buy but I aint gonna pay for a game that doesnt freakin work.,WFTO,cs2k4uk,3,t5_2t79x
4488816,0,t1_csw86qw,Well you can always reset the campaign to reset your home realm although if youre half way through I wouldnt suggest that. Especially since...There is a completed ticket for allowing the home realm to be reset which means the change has been made. Im just not sure if it was in the latest patch or is going to be in a upcoming one.Ill go find out and get back to you ,WFTO,cswh6qz,1,t5_2t79x
