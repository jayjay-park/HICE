And I also can relate to that I know it hasnt those things that keep people accessing phone games everyday and everytime. Or rather it heavily depends on the player. Some just find things to do by themselves and others would like to be encouraged a bit. I think the game is a bit like a random bunch of lego pieces by now. Some will have fun regardless some other would like to have instructions to follow to build something with a meaning. I personally think all the people should try to regain a bit of that spark that lets us create the fun everyone is growing more and more accustomed to the guided fun over the time and its not good for our brains but that is another matter for another time and its absolutely not to say that youre wrong.As you may imagine its hard for me to balance everything sometimes I screw up and I fix it later and Ill need time to create new events and mechanics so I hope youll bear a bit. I have some plans for example regarding different types of catch items and pp recovery items and particular ways to get them full sets of stats for each monster and IVs and the way to train them up events involving evil teams stealing monsters to recover etc. but they all need some time.Ill see if I can think about something quicker to implement too I hope youll find something you like to do in the meantime someone else could suggest something of what they like to do?. Thanks for this feedback!,gpsmonsterscouter,ddwch9d,3,t5_3ehqe
