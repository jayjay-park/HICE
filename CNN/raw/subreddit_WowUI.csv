672816,0,t3_21qswr,I had made a WA for everyone showing the duration of their soak debuff but it was ineffective. Visually we like the familiar. People react better when they have to take action to get rid of something unfamiliar. The original WA which is similar to what you want put something unfamiliar when you did things right. When you do it wrong aka dont have the debuff your screen looks as it normally does.So I flipped that around. I made a simple but super obnoxious weak aura flash in the middle of the screen when you did not have the debuff. It was pretty hard to ignore. No more rift problems after that. This WA flashes SOAK in big letters the middle of the screen and bounces until you go soak a rift.dOdadaGAGOwpvQfqXRfvMjvrZfOQzlfeiYTLsKQYEjgXrIFcuVsvwvomLgkvkdgKgUkCqQclJQXavNtuKfIKSuqyXuHLtXdbQuLhlvEUGHPsnvrMmsnDuxeiQiPmQQUUqBKkPTjQAZaUkskqYNvvFxuuJejvtdugnvbrNeiTefUgvIZRIMOLHghqOfCLSkPbkMdjinfOqGHxZfQbAcJgaBhcEqibWBDunfFZfBjqanhoTHIfRfcMBWIwRgTgTsAapcVYDuctJUchnZecjRTNnNjybacilFzawZGrsNhOgJqYAwAIRhXZMrtqjdUsASPFOKgFEGAbYXGwKGxiHSrPHxiHOgPykqbNtRXXOPcCfcrhfsymiqbPCdetTyajwuuPrSTOCAPabqbQBMIgIKIyRJSwiaVqcViaqbPwpyPLaIKwmGrsXIkXArcBQhnkPfjfRXwZhzXIfRvAzZrbQxnkaYrshxxOCOLIMDkxZNhoSzHoRFZKxbKbSSAKyBYupAcYNxnlPATCikPAlIsAbQDyWaYAhgmGSMJxKHIfReRVtwUMpRlUaFwVgTaYagiQSkPrxaavxSHpCIMxPfdyVpckhAMxdQKwBSHlLelwZhbgwFKchafOGnvBROfdypDbauDXguujwJnJgLkYfAcOOsJgDebasNhOgacqYvQPgXIbLKpAGcTqcstbkeyCHIflwsGddTyja,WowUI,cggqz6v,1,t5_2srqx

1032369,0,t3_25smw1,The incorrect tag notwithstanding as a healer I couldnt use this as the raid frames arent positioned well enough for me to see them as well as see what is going on around me.  As healers we spend most of our time staring at raid frames and I like mine to be positioned so I can glimpse the battle out of the corner of my eye as well but I realise thats difficult to do.  I do like that cast bar though ,WowUI,chlmvoj,1,t5_2srqx
1048189,0,t3_2643hd,I started a discussion over there but I guess I really shouldve posted here.  For convenience Ive copypasted my own thoughts belowSince all the zones are currently void and Ive been meaning to redo my UI or at the very least customize whatever ElvUI provides I started thinking about what I would want in an ideal UI. So I started writing up some points but what Im really interested to see other peoples opinions about whats important for their UI bonus provide screen shots!. If you really wanna go nuts talk about your keybinds especially if you pvp!.Main rotation abilities and spells    I strongly prefer a grid in the middle of my screen. I like this because it always shows what options are available to me I can see what cooldowns are available at a glance and perhaps most importantly I use it to help remember my keybinds e.g. the numbers gt then gt with shift modifiers below that etc..    The spellflash addon is very useful replete with clockwise cooldown indicator as well as a numerical indicator.    I dont like bars changing due to stance e.g. stealth brewmaster stance demonology form although this is handled well because it transforms existing spells and the transformed spells basically play the same role.Side bars    I think there is a need for another bar to throw quick or transient things in to for example a macro for spamming vent information or a RW warning to kill the MCd adds on Garrosh or group assignments for spoils or Lei Shen.    Related to the above there are things that I click  healthstones dps potions etc.  I know its a terrible habit.    Then there is commonly used stuff  mounts professions main bar for queuing dungeons  pvp.Spell cast bar  yours and the enemies    This is important enough to warrant its own section. Seeing what the enemy is doing e.g. big casts in pvp or several small attacks like deafening screech on Thok is very important. The enemy cast bar should be fairly prominent.    My own cast bar simply so I can simply clip things with lag or cancel if I dont think Ill be to queue the next spell fast enough e.g. chaos bolt into a silence is important.Meters    Damage meter and heal meter are important especially if youre leading a raid so you can do things like divide groups.    I havent had a need for a threat meter but it may not bad suggestion    I was considering adding a third meter just for interrupts  dispels but I think this is frivolous.Buffs  debuffs    For most DPS there are always several buffs to be mindful of there are the selfbuffs that you should always keep up mage invocation paladin inquisition rogue slice and dice monk tiger palm etc. there are the random procs that means you should do things mage pyroblast! trinket procs and DPS cooldowns to time with trinkets more often than not.    Debuffs that are hugely important e.g. sha of pride sha sear poison  freeze stacks on thok.    Almost all other buffs e.g. random raid buffs random benefits from people healing you are largely inconsequential?Raid frames    Keeping track of who is alive and who isnt class composition as well as their specs is essential.    I dont know what the best way to deal with debuff  personals management on raid frames is  I suppose whatever preset elvui rolls with does ok with it    Ideally Id have a way to monitor raid cooldowns as well e.g. devotion aura stacking smoke bomb healing tide etc..Focus    Currently my implementations of this are so poor that I hardly ever use this feature correctly. There just isnt enough prime realestate to be mindful of it all the time.    That being said Elvui by default adds frames to the right for bosses which is immensely helpful esp for things like paragons.    The tank targets assist targets arent as essential I think but theyre also relevant.Chat guildchat general chat raid chat whispers and say    When in raid I want to have spot to look at just for raid chat where people are typing things like theyre dying or belt group needs to be ressed. However I do want to be cognizant of whispers  guild chat especially if Im doing something like trash or hanging out in queue.My own health  mana  resource    This is pretty vital. A majority of the time Im looking at my resource arcane power embers demonic fury holy word combo points because this directly influences how much damage  healing I do. Health is obviously importantly as well especially to know exactly when to use defensive cooldowns other than being indicated by strawberry jam on face.Map  waypoints  quests    I lump all this together but overall its important quality of life. I feel this is all used while roaming around in the world and rarely in instances or pvp. The most vital thing is access to things like time being able to clearly see stuff like flight paths repair person nodes where rare mobs are etc.    Quest text as it is currently implemented is cumbersome with its all or nothing prospect. It would be ideal if only the quests for the region that Im in showed up.Targeting    There are many instances especially when dot cleaving or if something is required ASAP like touch of Yshaarj minions where tab targeting feels bad and manually clicking through to find the right target would be appropriate.,WowUI,chnfmel,1,t5_2srqx

3018045,0,t1_coasd9i,I guess Im not understanding what youre trying to do then because if you take a macro that says     cast Devastate    cast Heroic StrikeAnd you click that macro when the sweeps are  done then the expected response WOULD be for at least of the spells to fail to recast. Devastate cant be cast again because youd still be in GCD at that point.  Heroic Strike might still be cast as long as you have enough rage and its not in its own cooldown.Im testing again with timestamps up in my combat log and I cant produce anything that would be considered outside of what youd expect from your macro.  Im not saying youre wrong Im just saying that Im missing something here.TEST     Assume  Rage    . seconds I cast Shield Slam    . seconds Shield Slam Hits    . seconds Still in GCD for . more seconds because of my haste rating I click Macro    . seconds Devastate fails still recovering    . seconds Heroic Strike hits    From this point on your Heroic Strike cooldown isnt going to line up with your GCDTEST    Assume  Rage    . seconds I cast Macro    . seconds Devastate Hits    . seconds Heroic Strike Hits    . seconds Still in GCD for . more seconds because of my haste rating I click Macro    . seconds Devastate fails still recovering    . seconds Heroic Strike fails still recovering    . seconds I cast Macro    . seconds Devastate hits    . seconds Heroic Strike hitsMaybe what youre seeing is that the two abilities are getting out of sync because when youre spamming the macro it will sometimes cast heroic strike when devastate isnt usable and vice versa.

I havent tried to use MA for action bars so someone may have a better suggestion.Im not  certain that these will be lightweight enough for you.

This one gave me the most trouble because it took me a while to get the trigger figured out. I got this one to work mostly as well except sometimes the text I set up appears then disappears.

Plus I do like to review my healing breakdown between pulls when learning a new fight.I do like the suggestion for the target bar but AzCastBar doesnt have automatic profile switching based on spec so I made a generic layout for all specs.

8862659,0,t3_51mges,I honestly would imagine there is a way to do this but I dont know how to. I did see that you are using ElvUI so a suggestion would be to place the target cast bar near where your eyes typically gravitate towards and just look at the cast bar color. ElvUI colors the target cast bar red for casts that are noninterruptable by default.
