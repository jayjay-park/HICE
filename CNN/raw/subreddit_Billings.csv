6556772,0,t1_czwboht,It was funny that that made the news because the whole argument was full of holes.  Firstly Uber has their own insurance that will cover you if your own insurance does not.  They just require you to have insurance in general and will match whatever coverage you already have.  Second youre actually advised to not tell your insurance company that youre driving for Uber because it makes them obviously leery. Plus it doesnt matter because as I said above Ubers own insurance covers you when youre on the clock with them so technically your own insurance should not care if you drive for Uber or not since they never have to cover you if you are.  Third this is pretty much the same rule across the country and thousands of other Uber drivers arent having problems with it.,Billings,czxivk3,1,t5_2s78t
