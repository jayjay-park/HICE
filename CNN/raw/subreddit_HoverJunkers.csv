6407080,0,t3_3q91lc,I love this partgtQ Why is the gun so innaccurate?gtA The revolver has perfect precision you are bad at shooting. i cant wait for ordering the VIVE,HoverJunkers,czhx4q6,1,t5_38mm7
7112983,0,t1_d1m8fli,Why is that weird? The game is designed from the ground up for motion controls. It would be extremely difficult to make it work like a traditional FPS and doing so would make the playing field very uneven between Rift and Vive users. ,HoverJunkers,d1mnert,1,t5_38mm7
7314377,0,t1_d29l7r0,Yeah that is pretty true. Lots of variables like hand size and stuff as well I dont think Ive ever accidentally hit the steam button but I have see it mentioned as a downside in reviews.,HoverJunkers,d29lfk6,1,t5_38mm7
7477811,0,t3_4ht4ew,Hey Im glad youre having fun with the game!    We will keep adding content and adjusting things to make the game as fresh and exciting as we can. Hopefully we can get some ranked mode and server aggressiveness tags in there asap so that its not a field day against new players  is going to feel brutal on the receiving end haha.    If youve got the time please write a steam review so other players know what theyre getting into!  Well try to communicate that this game requires some practice and skill.  ,HoverJunkers,d2s6n6f,4,t5_38mm7
7499455,0,t3_4i34hq,Yes. Right now you can see your own ping to the host if you open your scoreboard. The more people we have in the game the more we can start filtering people into region specific and ping specific spots. HOWEVER I will say right now that even with  ms of latency and even  packet loss you shouldnt see someone popping around as we have implemented a lot of lag fix....    What you are most likely seeing is actually someones CPU having a hard time this is a much more difficult problem to fix and filter but we have some ideas for how to clean it up.,HoverJunkers,d2une0o,1,t5_38mm7
7501812,0,t1_d2uwy06,Weve had players who just want to play lying down in the office even its difficult to check what is really happening if not currently Impossible.    Im afraid such an advanced vote kick tracking times kicked etc system is a bit beyond us hell AAA games rarely include such features and we are pretty much only  people working on this project... I hate to disappoint but this is absolutely not something we have the capacity resources or bandwidth to even think about tackling at the moment not to mention the crazy amounts of other fixes people want on top of the bugs we need to address on top of the additional content everyone is expecting...,HoverJunkers,d2ux0pg,2,t5_38mm7
7501961,0,t1_d2uwto6,Yeah it might just be the super accuracy on the cover.,HoverJunkers,d2uxmls,1,t5_38mm7
7551875,0,t1_d30kq3u,WTF,HoverJunkers,d30m1tm,1,t5_38mm7
7582405,0,t1_d33qwnc,The ship health is the green bar right where the ignition area is that you point welder to start your ship moving.Thats good to know about the shotgun blast damage to the ship.  I was always curious how much hits it takes to kill a ship and never thought to shoot my own ship to figure it out. If you have two players on a ship and you both dual wield shotguns I guess you could take a ship out pretty quick that way vs going for the pilotpilots. ,HoverJunkers,d342z0y,1,t5_38mm7
7620173,0,t3_4jni3q,Im pretty sure the dev team already said that the grenades would explode on impact. They dont want people diving into walls trying to throw enemy grenades back.,HoverJunkers,d38dh46,3,t5_38mm7
7660409,0,t1_d3cih36,Great to hear!,HoverJunkers,d3cy138,1,t5_38mm7
7748282,0,t3_4lax2u,Yeap i definitely thought this as i was trying to switch,HoverJunkers,d3mx84q,3,t5_38mm7
7849056,0,t1_d3wvvsl,This is incorrect and I have tried this many times. This was also posted in the thread on Steam and the OP responded saying it does not work. My computer is on the longer side. The play space will always be pointed towards one of the two longest sides of the boundary you define. I tested this extensively. If your playspace is currently xm then pick a ship that is at least  meters long on one side. If you look to either side of your ship youll find that you can walk outside its edges and if you walk towards the front or back of the ship you will see that your playspace is about  meter too small to reach the front and back. This thread has gotten a lot of upvotes despite being downvoted many times I believe a lot of people most likely all players are experiencing this issue. Several others have posted about it on the Steam forums and it has been mentioned in Steam reviews.,HoverJunkers,d3yaxt1,1,t5_38mm7
7904965,0,t1_d44hmhg,NP. And depending on where you are if you would like to train feel free to PM me and Ill add you and see and we can do a training session. ,HoverJunkers,d44ldnl,2,t5_38mm7
7984464,0,t1_d4d7863,Yeah I mean it didnt affect the game too much but it was strange getting killed by someone whos face was buried in their own crotch. ,HoverJunkers,d4dj2a5,1,t5_38mm7
8183103,0,t1_d50ehli,Ive played against you and maybe what your seeing from inside your ship is different than what others have seen but I have watched you with your face sticking thru the shields and your arm and gun wrapped around a shield shooting people.   Maybe your not seeing this or it is some sort of glitch but it does get old for the rest of us to come across someone who only has the smallest amount of their head showing thru the center of a shield and then watches where they are shooting to kill everyone else.  Im not a noob as of last night I was about th or th of all time just short of hitting my first million points and regularly get th or th for the week.  Again it may be that your not seeing what we see and that is where the issue is but for the rest of us it does get tiring seeing people hanging out of the bottom of their ship or peeking thru the shields or hiding in the dumpster and popping their head out long enough to shoot people.  If you want to compare it to a drive by then stick your head out the window not thru the steel frame of the door.  That is what it looks like to the rest of us.  ,HoverJunkers,d50fs3v,5,t5_38mm7
8223618,0,t3_4rdwyo,I know they mentioned they were going to use double sided models so if you find anything specific then you should bring it to their attention.As for junk clipping I had an idea that might detract people from using clipping or at least make it a bit more obvious that they are doing it so that you can vocally call them out on it. Cheating just for the sake of winning ruins everyone elses game. Anyways check this following picture for an exampleSo in the first part of the images you should see what appears to be a basic hover junker layout. The rings are the spots to put your junk the square with the green dot is your terminal and the block with the brown hitbox outline is your junk. This is currently what we have ingame at the moment.Now the shady part is what you see in figure two once the gun is in the box the projectile will never make an impact with our junks hitbox because it spawned inside of it so it allows you to fire through it. Normally you would think hey if you cant see where you are shooting then it doesnt matter well most of us top players use instinct shooting. We dont aim with the sights we aim with our hand eye coordination so someone like me can peak around the top corner and as so long as I can see a glimpse of my opponent Im going to be able to hit him reliably.Which brings us to figure three. If the hitboxes on the junk was fashioned so that when the interior of the ships view of the junk had a hollow middle you would have to position your gun where it is at on figure four in order to shoot through since the hitboxes would be six thin rectangles as opposed to a fat square and a fat trapezoid. This would make it obvious when a player is cheating which would hopefully keep an honest man honest.,HoverJunkers,d55ib67,1,t5_38mm7
8264910,0,t1_d59nb4k,I cant say for sure that Im noticing issues with PvP I think it exists there too but I havent tested it specifically like I have with buzzbots. Im only going off gameplay feel from a few games I hosted with random people vs joining random people so in PvP it may totally just be a latency issue or something else.,HoverJunkers,d5ao6d8,1,t5_38mm7
8294788,0,t1_d5e2q09,In theory yes. In practice the game is broken by their big hyped free content update. The whole networkinglobby system is junk.,HoverJunkers,d5eeobz,1,t5_38mm7
8478837,0,t1_d618ct7,Im not so sure the CPU is my problem. I do agree that its showing its age and is at least partly responsible but games like Raw Data are much more demanding in every sense yet dont have these problems for me. Im not sure what Hover Junkers is doing that makes it so demanding on CPUs.,HoverJunkers,d61ebaq,1,t5_38mm7
