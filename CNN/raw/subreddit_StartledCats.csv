When the muscles tense your pupils openget bigger.Edit I have no idea why Im being downvoted.From Wikipedia When the sphincter pupillae contract the iris decreases or constricts the size of the pupil. The dilator pupillae innervated by sympathetic nerves from the superior cervical ganglion cause the pupil to dilate when they contract.

10631131,0,t1_ddc4gih,Cats are kind of weird because of where they are on the foodchain. They are predators but they are small enough to be in danger from a wide variety of other animals. Pretty sure this is why their behavior can go from offering you their soft belly huge nono and requires great trust in the animal world to spazzing out and biting you when you rub their belly TOO long. ,StartledCats,ddciqq4,27,t5_2yb9w

11545217,0,t1_dg4nd4c,Yep this method is the most simple and least traumatic way to train a dog or cat. Ever since I was a kid my mom always used standard squirt bottles with water to keep the cats off the counters and tables. I still use this method today. Works like a charmEDIT I want to add that making a sound in conjunction with squirting them will create a layered association with their negative behavior. I make a  pissssssssttttt sound while squirting them and now can forgo using the bottle altogether. The sound is enough to make them scatter. One of them is hilarious she still squints her eyes every time she hears it. ,StartledCats,dg4nhvm,45,t5_2yb9w
