1102097,0,t1_chta5v1,I think theres little that a general purpose demo reel would cover which wouldnt be better covered in a more specific one. Itd be like going shopping for shoes but being forced to look at jackets and hats before and after every couple pairs. They could be the nicest jackets and hats in the world but they still arent shoes and not what youre trying to see. And if you know you have to visit  or  or more shops that day well... you probably arent even going to bother. Basically what uDeadDillo said about the casting director. As for going back and redoing Airchecks I dont see the harm. Even if you dont post them its still practice. Ive gone back and looked at older Airchecks and played around with ideas for them.

4253758,0,t3_39n0jo,Right so here goesAs far as voice goes you have a good one. The only small issue you have is the slightly heavy pronunciation of the letter s. Its just a touch thick and feels strained at times but it doesnt show through all the time and I imagine that it can be managed.As far as what it feels like its almost like youre thickening your entire tongue inside your mouth in order to pronounce that letter. However its most like due to positioning it too close to your teeth youre placing the tip of your tongue a bit too forward towards your teeth. Try a placement more towards the natural resting place of the tip of your tongue when your mouth is closed towards the middle of the roof of your mouth right when it starts to curve up into your mouth going all the way to the throat. So try position your tongue about a  behind your teeth when pronouncing the letter s and keep your tongue relaxed and light.Hopefully I didnt ramble on too much I just figured more detailed explanation might help out better than a simple one.Cheers,recordthis,cs545gt,3,t5_2sr9a

Make it a total departure from yourself. The delivery of the first script sounds a bit rushed. Take your time and experiment!With the second script I feel that more energy would have given you a much better read but I do like the commercial sound youve got. Sounds like some real potential there.  You read the third script as though you were reading the second. That switch from a commercial read to a dramatic read is a big one. The monologue has to be performed as though you are working this material in front of an audience on stage. That monologue should be a fully formed D character when you record it. Build and internalize the character then work from there. Keep going man!,recordthis,cxpz4bn,1,t5_2sr9a

6696434,0,t3_479dhq,I think that your demo could benefit from being broken up into a few clips to showcase your commercialnarrative range. When youre ready you might consider investing in a professionally mastered demo. A professional engineer will make your demo sound polished and be able to add music and other elements to make each clip sound like a real spot. That being said your tone in the demo also seemed a bit flat. Try to annunciate more and play with your inflection and pitch to give a more dynamic and exciting delivery.I really enjoyed the voices on your voice reel. My only advice for that would be to try using bits of dialogue from real animation scripts but reading them in your unique character voices. This will make each line on the reel sound more purposeful and genuine and less improvised. For example you can pick an obscure line of dialogue from Rocky and Bullwinkle but that doesnt mean that you have to read it like any of the characters from that show. ,recordthis,d0bywh4,2,t5_2sr9a

8974394,0,t3_5356ys,Honestly I think it could use another pass not because you did a bad job but because the mic seems to be set up poorly and I couldnt hear all of what you were doing.  The competition specifically says they arent looking for studio quality recordings but you have to know that clearer audio will mean they can form a better opinion of the voice artist and the setup made you sound muffled.Also slow down.  Work out the pace you think is right... Then do it at  of that speed... Trust me youll be far happier with the result.,recordthis,d7ql49v,2,t5_2sr9a
9250155,0,t1_d8o81aq,huh thats news to me too. Last time I was active around here this sub had problems with people requesting free recordings for commercial purposes which is obviously a little messed up. I guess the mods decided its easier if everything has to be paid rather than figure out which free requests are okay and which are not.Unfortunate that it would even have to come to that...,recordthis,d8oiw7p,1,t5_2sr9a

9927570,0,t3_5hn1fz,Well it sounds like this part of the VO industry could benefit from someone with an entrepreneurial spirit. Theres definitely money to be made. I feel like the non LA and NY voice actor scenes can make a serious dent to the present paradigm in the VO industry. Im on board and will offer supportskillsexperience if needed. Definitely will revisit thread.,recordthis,db1l5s6,3,t5_2sr9a
