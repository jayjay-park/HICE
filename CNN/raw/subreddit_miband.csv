3189959,0,t3_2wnzm5,Im waiting for my Mi Band now so I cant really tell you how accurate this information is however as no one else has answered maybe this will at least get you on your way to fixing it.From what I understand the Mi Band is not compatible with any thirdparty alarms yet?. Ive believe I read that some people get an app that acts as a notification reminder so if you dont dismiss certain notifications Im assuming you get to pick which app this app renotifies you essentially. So you could perhaps use this app to get Timely to renotify you until you dismiss it.However Im not sure what this app is called as I didnt really look into it since my Mi Band isnt here yet. Also Id imagine that if you have a crappy phone like I do adding more running processes isnt really ideal.,miband,cosn0oh,3,t5_35vcc
3247068,0,t1_coxpizi,yup thats right friend because i see on miui forum they already made that tweak for android users for your miband to level up a little bit by adding some notification.so i think maybe it would be possible also on ios jailbroken device.also on mi fit apps that arrived at apple store still far away from mi fit apps that google play release speaking about feature etc.,miband,coykf8g,1,t5_35vcc

4632856,0,t1_cteipfj,I dont think the band that you posted would fit tightly around the original Mi Band strap though. The pictured band is definitely thicker and available on Aliexpress for  bucks with free shipping but I assume you know that since you posted the picture?.You could probably just use a thin stripe of electrical tape on one or both sides. Changing them out once a month shouldnt be too expensive if you even have to change them instead of pulling them off a little bit to remove the sensor for charging.,miband,ctejh8n,1,t5_35vcc

6545937,0,t1_czwdwmf,I was hoping I could install some other app and get rid of Mi Fit completely but it looks as though Mi Band Tools and Mi Band Notify V only add features to it they dont work without it.I actually want to have everything sync up on Google Fit have everything record there but Ive started running into problems when multiple apps try to sync the same kind of activity to Google Fit.I have Strava and now Mi Fit syncing activities to Google Fit and it looks as though Mi Fit won against Strava I have the Mi Fit activity in Google Fit which is based on estimated steps and estimated distance whereas the Strava activity had GPS and heartrate measurements from a Garmin HR band I also have Sleep as Android syncing sleeping data to Google Fit I need to see how this works with Mi Fit trying to sync sleep data as well havent slept since getting the Mi band yet   ... my guess is one of the apps is going to override the other but in this case Id like it to be Mi Fit as it has heart rate information.,miband,czweiqo,1,t5_35vcc
6587114,0,t3_45ufsl,Bluetooth is a battery hog on any phone. My question is why you need it permanently  enabled? Just turn it on and sync once or twice a day. The Mi Band still counts steps and tracks sleep regardless of whether its connected or not.,miband,d00nth4,1,t5_35vcc

7390329,0,t3_4gharr,Yeah its pretty inaccurate. I use Google Fit on my phone as a step counter with Mi Band Tools linked to Google Fit for heart rate tracking. I then use Strava to link my cycling to Fit.I do find the sleep tracking of the mi band pretty accurate but find that walking around with my phone in my pocket to be a more accurate measurement of steps as it wont be picking up typing etc whilst Im sat at my desk. Comparing the two today the mi band thinks Ive walked  steps whereas fit says . Ive also cycled for  miles which fit knows about but mi band presumably thinks is walking as well somehow... ,miband,d2i8aha,1,t5_35vcc

Your suggestion is interesting and thank you for it but I can already evaluate it myself  it is not necessary. Mi Band Tools already does that and much more complex algorithms I want to keep private for intervals of  minutes or less but I guess our support already told you so since you are referring to the same threshold of  minutes.Im sorry but you are posting some passages completely out of context and I wont be spending my time to even comment them. As I said above and this is my last comment in this topic there is no issue and the algorithms are not using some random approximation but are absolutely accurate when youre using the heart rate monitor for useful things like monitoring your heart rate zones or actively monitoring your resting pulse. Reading through the discussion I guess that our users already figured out that any artificial approximation is wrong in the long term.,miband,d3grkr0,1,t5_35vcc

But you are accusing me of distributing firmware binaries in the app. And even if I wrote I do not do this you write like I plan to do it. And speaking of split personality could you please tell me who EliKiel and LucyNero are for you?,miband,de27b4a,1,t5_35vcc

11673521,0,t1_dgivnva,Im using my band mostly for notifications.I feel like Mi Band Master has everything Mi Fit does except firmware upgrade Mi Band Tools only add better notification configuration  it does not provide any fitnessrelated features.I never managed to properly play around with Notify amp Fitness because the app kept freezing it can probably be a good app for people caring about fitness features but I cant know that.I say give Mi Band Master free a try and see for yourself if you will like it.Notify and Fitness requires to not have Mi Fit installed and that you unpaired the band I really did not liked it because as I said before there is a risk you wont be able to pair your band again which will make it simply useless. Of course some people say its impossible but yet a lot of people reported such issue.Of course you can just stay with Mi Fit its good app but it lacks a lot features smart alarm waking you up in most optimal time  xiaomi removed it due to some issues continous heart rate measurement better statistics per dayweekmonth organization showing SMSCall contact displaying App notifications title and content button actions for example controlling musicAll those seem to be implemented in Mi Band Master.Sorry if someone think Im advertisingpromoting this app on purpose  Im not and Im not affiliated with its developer.,miband,dgj7kb0,1,t5_35vcc
