90184,0,t1_ceoolki,Well First off Hermaphrodites  dont really occur in human populations as that designation implies a fully working set of both genitalia. But yes they have a non normative sexual designation because they do not fit binary sex. Their gender identity may however be binary. However I am speaking about intersex people  a term that covers a wide range of non normative sexual characteristics. Sometimes more ambiguous genitalia exist and that can effect how people relate to their bodies. And in turn how others relate to their bodies no matter how fucked that is.,RedditDayOf,ceop2t0,14,t5_2t1r3
93790,0,t1_ceotjqr,I actually has a degree in Biology and I think I can answer your question. Keep in mind that the actual truth is nuanced and personal not necessarily based in science.Fact Biology does weird things. There is no purpose for anything. Traits develop largely at random and those that are a better fit for the environment tend to be the ones that reproduce the most. When we think of disabilities e.g. congenital problems like cystic fibrosis many of these are passed down through generations at recessive alleles. Why? Because they were useful at one time? No. They just piggybacked off of reproductively successful people. Theres no reason or use for them.Likewise with social organisms mammals and birds in particular reproductively maladaptive behavior such as gay sex has been seen in all sorts of species. Do you think these wild animals dont fight for survival daily? I think they do and they still have gay animals. In human societies throughout history transgendered people have played a part in many cultures. Its not a modern invention.As with sexuality we can look at gender similarly. The origins of it are unknown. We dont know if its genetic epigenetic or based off of something weird happening during embryonic development. However in the US alone there are over  trans identified people. There are millions of gay people. None of us are disabled by our gender or sexuality per se. Hell Im just as likely to reproduce now as I was before I transitioned because I froze some sperm before starting on this quest!So I would have to say no transgenderism is not a disability. It is useful that now we have medical interventions available that help transgender people fully realize their gender but this doesnt make us disabled for needing it.,RedditDayOf,cep3wj1,8,t5_2t1r3

1100062,0,t1_chtbobd,Ha. Funny! Although I cant let the inaccuracy stand. Baptisms for the dead do not automatically make them accept the baptism. The Mormons believe that after death you still live in a pre judgement state in which people still have the chance to accept the Gospel of Jesus Christ. That includes a baptism by those given authority to do so. Since they believe that the baptism has to be both physical and spiritual it is not possible for a dead person to receive one. The Mormons perform baptisms by proxy in the place of the dead people to accept if they desire they do still have the option to not accept it. The Mormons make reference in part to  Corinthians  in the Bible as proof that Baptism for the Dead was a practice before and been restored through modern revelation. This is not a bot I seek not to argue the points just make them more clear. Thanks! ,RedditDayOf,chtbyyz,9,t5_2t1r3

I used to go see dermatologists and doctors would say that I could get it removed but then I would have a scar on my face. either way there was going to be something there. And what made me want to keep it was when people would start to draw pictures of me and I would see that shape in the pictures and I thought oh wow this is a part of me.

That said your link doesnt really show the numbers for military and  times as high raises my eyebrows significantly making me think we are just looking at raw deaths and not factoring in per capita if the transportation industry is  times larger than the military population does having  times as many deaths really indicate it being more dangerous?.  I also wonder where military transportation jobs like M fall in the statistics.  If someone on active duty dies transporting equipment are they counted in both groups?Doing the math we had  military members die in combat in  and we have roughly  armed forces personnel between active duty and reserves.  That makes a death rate of roughly . per  significantly higher than the . fatal injuries per  workers in the linked article.

2041011,0,t3_2i6f1c,The SchmidtRubin family of rifles was the primary arm of the Swiss military for just over forty years and remained a heavy influence for decades later with the closely related K. I have a terrible addiction to collecting them so thought Id share some of them here! The three major phases are represented  Model  Model G and Model K  and the photo captions should explain the intricacies of them but here is a short summary of their history.In  the Swiss made the Model  Vetterli their main service rifles becoming the first country to issue a magazinefed repeating rifle firing selfcontained cartridges. This revolutionary firearm served the Swiss well  insofar as its peaceful deployment in the famously neutral country can  but as the Vetterli design having undergone a few updates reached the two decade mark it was time to replace it.Tasked with designing the next generation of Swiss martial armaments Major Rudolf Schmidt developed another revolutionary rifle. Using a straightpull bolt action design and utilizing Major Eduard Rubins smallcaliber highvelocity cartridge the Model  debuted bearing the names of the two men most responsible for its birth  SchmidtRubin.The Model  was a lengthy rifle at just over  but not unusual for the era. The round magazine could be stripper loaded with a dozen of the .xmm rimless semismokeless cartridges which offered not only better accuracy than the Vetterl but doubled the range.The first overhaul of the design came about with the Model  which focused on strengthening the reciever and bolt by enlarging the locking lugs and moving them forwards. This would be followed by two shortened variants the Model  and Model  which brought the overall length down to . and  respectively intended for use by mounted troops artillerymen signal battalions and engineers amongst other noninfantry troops. These two variants also saw the magazine reduced to only  rounds as the round magazine was thought to get in the way.In  the SchmidtRubin would undergo an even more extensive overhaul. The new .xmm smokeless cartridge offered much better performance compared to the semismokeless round of the Model  and the Model  was primarily introduced to accommodate this round. The sixround magazine from the short rifles was retained as it was decided that the extra rounds offered by the round didnt outweigh the cumbersome nature of it especially in the prone position.The Model  came in two versions not counting older rifles updated to Model  standards and called the Model  the fulllength Infanteriegewehr G which entered production in  and the shortened Karabiner K which followed on its heels in . The era of long rifles was coming to an end and the G ended production in  in favor of the K which was adopted as the general service rifle from that point onwards.The K would be the ultimate SchmidtRubin design. In  when the Swiss once again decided they needed an update while the straightpull was retained and the influence of Maj. Schmidts  year old design could be seen in many respects the Karabiner  K that resulted was a new gun.And thats a brief overview of the SchmidtRubins! I have a unexplainable love for them and as you can see am getting quite the collection with the three primary phases   G and K  represented although I hope to one day have one of every one. While I have a K as well it isnt represented here since it doesnt properly belong! But if you want to learn more about the K check out this article I wrote on the fascinating rifle!Also sorry that the photos of the K are so grainy. It is my most recent acquisition and I meant to get these photos done earlier in the day and totally forgot so did them last night with very bad lighting so they dont look nearly as good as the other ones.

When they steal constantly from everyone around them? When I am a child and they are a parent and they are waking me up in the middle of the night to tell me that life is not worth living and that its probably better to kill ones self? When they psychologically punishdominate others every time they do something they dont like even though it is absolutely innapropriate to do so because the action they did is nowhere near the realm of needing punishment in order to manipulatedominate all their friends and loved ones into catering to their every whim? Should my mantra be be kind when someone with bi polar disorder combined with alcoholism starts beating the shit out of their girl friend my very good friend on a regular basis?I hate this you need to try to treat people with mental illness the same way you treat people who are diabetic crap. Its bull shit. Fucking bull shit. You have absolutely no clue what mental illness is. Your words are beyond naive. You wanna hear my mantra? Do whatever you need to do to keep yourself healthy.

6970113,0,t1_d16afbn,gt Which theoristsauthors influence your practice?Gerald Gardner and Doreen Valiente are two of my biggest influences primarily because they are the creators of Wicca and thus are primary sources. Also because they held differing opinions. Where as Gardner is the primary influence of more traditional coven based Wicca Valiente espoused a Wiccan philosophy that went on to influence the more solitary eclectic practices of today. With all of that said. I dont view them as anything more than people. They were people like you or I. Their works while interesting are not to be held up as holy writ. gt What are the central beliefs or practices you feel one must have in order to be considered Wiccan?. Belief in the God and Goddess. Following of the Sabbats and Esbats. Practicing magicThese are bare minimum. Some may get more specific though. It depends on who you ask.gt Do you differentiate between Wicca and Witchcraft?This is a tricky question. Initially Wicca was not cashed Wicca. It was called Witchcraft and those who practiced witchcraft were called witches or sometimes The Wica. Some argued that witchcraft was too blatant a name and this too dangerous to use in many instances and Wicca was a more appropriate name. Wicca derives from an old AngloSaxon word for witch or wiseone. Gerald Gardner himself didnt like calling it Wicca actually. He preferred to call it witchcraft and reclaim the title. Those in support of calling it Wicca prevailed in the end however. Nowadays while the religion is called Wicca Witchcraft has become a term for a kind of ritual system used by Wiccans as well as nondenominational practitioners of witchcraft. Though those practices may vary from those of Wiccan ritual somewhat.gt Any opinions on Scott Cunningham?  I read some of his works couldnt stand him.Im ok with Cunningham. I think a guide for the solitary practitioner specifically is best read however as a companion to a more coven based or traditional book like Raymond Bucklands Complete Book of WitchcraftI have a small book list that organizes significant books about Wicca by perspective. So Cunningham is in the eclectic section Buckland is in the traditional section Gardner is in the historical but not necessarily accurate section and Hutton for example is in the Academic section. I can give you that list if youre interested. gt Any opinions on Ronald Hutton?I thoroughly enjoyed Triumph of the Moongt How do you and others in the community approach Margaret Murray in light of the lack of support for her theories?Everyone recognizes that Murrays theories are wrong. Which is good however I think shes ignored a bit too much now. While her theories are obviously wrong its still a part of Wiccan history and I would argue a part of our mythology at this point. gt Any opinions on Aradia or the Gospel of Witches by Charles Leland?A most likely false but fascinating influential and poetic account of what the witch cult might have looked like were it to exist. The first chapter heavily influenced The Charge of The Goddess.gt How do you view the problem of cultural appropriation among some Eclectic Wiccans?It annoys me. If you want to use something from another culture ASK FIRST! If youre told no then dont touch it. If youre told yes do your research and be respectful. gtThanks OP!No problem if you have any more questions feel free to ask!,RedditDayOf,d16edfk,3,t5_2t1r3

7176289,0,t3_4dr2js,The article is a fun read but its a pretty meaningless list.  Its safe to say that most video games not just arcade video games which this list has exclusively from the s have been forgotten.  Im talking  of them including console games and computer video games.  There were close to  commercial games made for the Commodore  alone and that was just one platform.  Granted the C was the most popular personal computer of the decade but there were tons of games made for dozens of other computer platforms and for consoles you had the tail end of the Atari  and Intellivision era then the Atari  and Colecovision followed by the NES and Master System and those were just the well known consoles.  Long story short there were trainloads of video games made in the s.But this list is made up solely of arcade titles so lets focus on that.  Youd be better off making a list of the arcade video games that are most remembered by the GenXers who grew up with them.  If you asked the average  to yearold to list the ones they actually remember Id bet their thoughts would quickly trail off after naming only  or  titles on average.  With a little more thought they may be able to come up with .  This is based on my own experience when Ive had that discussion with people in my age bracket Im in my mid s.I grew up in the late s and the s and I have collected classic arcade games from that era for close to ten years now so I have a lot more knowledge than the average person about this era of arcade video games.  The collector community for arcade games from the golden era roughly and generously  is thousands strong in America alone and there are many collectors in Canada the UK Europe and Australia as well to name just a few strongholds outside of the U.S.So heres the list from the articleDonkey Kong   Bubbles  Peter Peppers Ice Cream Factory  Pooyan  Nibbler  Major Havoc  PacLand  The NewZealand Story  I Robot  Crossbow  Among the community of arcade game collectors I can safely say that only two of those are largely forgotten The NewZealand Story and Peter Peppers Ice Cream Factory.  The NewZealand Story is from  and is likely extremely rare today because Ive never even heard of it despite spending many years on the worlds most active arcade collecting forum KLOV.  Apparently its on a Taito multi board.  It must suck because Ive never heard anyone talk about it ever.  Easy target for an article about forgotten s video games a category that numbers in the thousands.Peter Peppers Ice Cream Factory is an obscure sequel to Burgertime.  People have heard of it almost no one owns one today.  It is regarded as a neat curiosity but not as good as Burgertime so there is less effort to track it down.PacLand is very rare these days but many people remember it there was an excellent port of it for the Commodore  that I spent many hours playing back in the day.The rest of the titles in this list are well known amongst the arcade game collecting community and are owned by many although several are hard to come by due to high demand and limited supply.  Some of them are often used in tournaments like Donkey Kong  Nibbler and I Robot.  Nibbler has been very sought after in recent years and even has its own movie for Petes sake.  Bubbles and Pooyan are getting hard to come by but are regularly sought by collectors.  And Major Havoc has been a grail for collectors for most of this hobbys existence going back close to  years now.  Complete dedicated working Major Havoc cabinets are highly sought after and command .  Even the ones in converted Tempest cabs are fetching stupid prices now.And for the record I Robot is freaking awesome.  Fun fact it was the first ever video game to use D polygons.  The game play is a little abstract but it is essentially the same as Williams Make Trax paint every square inch of all of the pathways on the level to move on to the next level.  Deceptively simple but tons of fun.  The HallEffect joystick adjustable D camera the EyeintheSky and other weird enemies cool sound effects and the platformsinspace setting just make it deliciously weird and addictive.

Well Ive had it before so I know its about x as big as the ones at Taco Bell and much better. But what about the first time I had it when I didnt have that experience? Well at that point it was only a few bucks. Might as well try it. If the burrito cost  more I would never have tried it.Part of the problem is that airlines do a really shitty job of differentiating themselves. How am I supposed to know X has  more legroom than Y? Studying airline seat layouts is not my fulltime job. So I buy based on the information I do have which is. Price.. Airport locations.. Flight time.. Layover details.. Personal past experience if applicable. This is rarely a factor. Ive used a lot of different airlines and theyre mostly the same.
