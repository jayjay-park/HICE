5558129,0,t3_3r9ddg, is your full linkBarettaL Vero Bella Bernard  revive is probably your best option. If that team isnt able to do it then the issue is with the runes which we can look at further at that point. This was my first team using Eladriel as the revive but there are plenty of substitutions  Michelle Mikene or Teon light garuda can all work.You will probably have to go left crystal gt right crystal gt dragon. It will be slow  minutes but safe.,likeatruck,cwm1c7p,1,t5_39i9g
