We need a little more authoritarianism and a little less toleration of states rights garbage. The south has no right to secede and it would be a failure of a nation if it was allowed to do so. The ignorant often get in the way of true progress given the chance to freely express their opinions. ,ModelTimes,d3fxacv,1,t5_3e91i

I cant think of a more democratic thing.Let us quote the great president Thomas Jefferson in which he said If any state in the Union will declare that it prefers separation . . . to a continuance in union . . .
