118083,0,t3_1v2gry,Issue  was fun and very s super hero comicbooky as many have said about earlier issues  I like it and theyre great filler and definitely need to be in there but I love issues  and  and I have a lot to say about them.  Its confirmed that the costume is a living thing with a mind of its own which had been alluded to in issue  when the chains attacked Overtkill and the cape crawled away.  We get foreshadowing to issue  as Vindicator or whichever it was comments that no ones seen inside level VII.    Issues  give us more canonical knowledge about how Heaven and Hell operate than any issue so far and if I recall any issue for a long time coming.And we begin to learn that the denizens of Heaven arent particularly good or nice and Hell isnt bad or evil that everyone just seems to be caught up in their war.  Up until now the th level was all of hell wed been exposed to and it seemed pretty traditionally hellish so this is where we the reader really started to realize how broad this universe really is.  I hadnt been paying attention to anything Spawn for about  or more years.  One of the things I liked about it was that it always had an oil painting feel to it.  Yeah they cost a little more than regular MarvelDC issues at the time though only a little but they were glossy paper all the way through and you could really see the pride that Todd and his colorists took in their art.The reason I bring up the artwork is that it breaks my heart to see Angela go from this to this at Marvel  though Ill admit that some of the other modern renditions of her still do some semblance of justice but had I not been reading an article about the character when I saw the EW image I wouldnt have known it was supposed to be Angela  and being a fan of the character it was sort of sickening.  The only good that came of it  is that I now appreciate more the original work.  I cant believe I went through all of that without mentioning Cogliostro so Ill leave him up to someone else.,Spawn,cervlqi,4,t5_2ru8b
228037,0,t1_cf4dokf,It didnt click to me either but I tend to read blogs about the issues I wanted to know what the fuck Al did to him at the end and one of them commented that Liefeld had warned of a big reveal in relation to Issue  of Spawn.,Spawn,cf4dtqj,2,t5_2ru8b
1209133,0,t1_ci1y49n,I remember when I was a kid I wanted to meet the real Al Simmons so badly and ride around in the Spawnmobile. Whatever promo tour that was never came close to Canada though so that was shit. However years later I was buying Spawn stuff on eBay and when I got my packages they said the return shipping address was Al Simmons. I thought it was a clever joke but it turns out that was actually him. I was buying Spawn stuff from Al Simmons. Small world!,Spawn,ci5n984,1,t5_2ru8b
1565225,0,t3_2br6wa, year old me loved the movie but theres two things Ive always hated about it the long credits introduction sequence and Malebolgias awful CGI.I always thought Michael Jai White played Spawn perfectly. I recently heard Todd McFarlane is trying to do a new Spawn movie I hope he casts Michael as Spawn again.,Spawn,cjch2oj,2,t5_2ru8b

3025478,0,t3_2urod9,I just got done reading issue  and honestly Im disappointed. I feel that it took too many pages for the book to tell the little story that it did. The art was also uninspiring as well. Im afraid of what the spawn comic will end up with the new writer and artist. Mainly the artist. This probably isnt a popular opinion but Im not really impressed with jonboys art.,Spawn,cobl6ie,2,t5_2ru8b

7759898,0,t1_d3o74uz,Ok Omega Spawn was messing around with the Omniverse hereEvery Omniverse is made from Multiverses so do we have proof from the comics or databooks about how many multiverse are or is that scan the only ones in it.,Spawn,d3o8o4y,1,t5_2ru8b
7799113,0,t1_d3o8o4y,They never say how many there are.  Also keep in mind all the multiverses invincible has and include those as well,Spawn,d3soizc,1,t5_2ru8b
7988926,0,t1_d4duh2l,thats really unfortunate. thanks for replying though. I am also very confused.,Spawn,d4e15jp,1,t5_2ru8b
10586420,0,t3_5q0fs6,Cyan seems to be a teenager now.  Shes in a group home and suffers from depression.   Terry visits her regularly.There was this whole ordeal with his suit. When it is living its a symbiote and is evil when its dormant its just a costume. Spawn expelled her from the suit and gained control.Its a long story but he ended up with the god sword took a trip to hell and faughtbfor Wanda.    Currently spawn is a street level hero.  He lost his power. His strength level seems to be like jessica jones. Strong and tough but a bullet could kill him if shot in the right spot.,Spawn,dd7wp44,2,t5_2ru8b

11760570,0,t1_dgs8od1,Grainy pages and slick inking gives it an almost textured look. Fits the atmosphere of drawings. The paper isnt too thin the pages seem to almost flutterfloat one to the other as I flip through it. I like this quality of paper not too heavy yet you can tell its made to be read multiple times.,Spawn,dgt39dk,2,t5_2ru8b
