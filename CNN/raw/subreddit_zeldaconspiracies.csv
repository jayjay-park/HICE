221897,0,t1_cf3kebp,What I mean is that the split between A amp B was caused by the defeat of Ganon because in the theory Link dies in the timeline with no previous timetravel then B was split into B amp C when ZeldaB sent Link back.You dont need timetravel to explain Navis knowledge anyway. Fairies protect Kokiri from danger so its no surprising that they know about monsters and they are found all over Hyrule so they obviously know where the landmarks are.Plus I think the Epona LinkB finds in Termina is actually the real one he lost so there wouldnt be a horse for LinkC to find.,zeldaconspiracies,cf3pwsb,2,t5_2udps

1677242,0,t1_cjqg0cr,Most of the console iterations and some of the portable ones have excellent underlying themes that are not obvious until further inspection. Majoras Mask is the big exception because it simply has several very dark themes going around simultaneously.,zeldaconspiracies,cjqkupc,3,t5_2udps

2719561,0,t3_2r6b26,Thanks! We were pretty excited when we researched the mythology of Moths and saw the parallels. Were desperately awaiting a sequel to Majoras Mask as I assume most Zelda fans are. The game was so bizarre and unrelated to the typical structure of other Zelda games Im surprised they havent built off of it more.,zeldaconspiracies,cnd7ary,5,t5_2udps
3163537,0,t1_cont6b4,Thank you for this answer. Without a doubt Majoras mask is certainly an interesting title. I like how it didnt try topoutoutdo ocarina of time but I feel like it was just focusing on being different as a whole.,zeldaconspiracies,copwdul,1,t5_2udps

Control your emotions. gtThe fact that he turned into a freaking Stalfos ought to tell you he had a cursed death at least.He wasnt a Stalfos he was DEAD. He appeared as a revenant because he was dead.,zeldaconspiracies,cwg16g6,7,t5_2udps
7948213,0,t3_4kzrci,It definitely takes place after Wind Waker.I knew the second I saw the rusty Master Sword. Why Link just woke from a  year nap is odd though so we can only put the pieces together once we have more information.The major clues. Palm Trees. Rusty Master Sword. Insignia on SailclothMain indicator that it takes place some time after Wind WakerKoroks are present. ,zeldaconspiracies,d49gcoo,3,t5_2udps
11341305,0,t3_5ykncn,In context Zeldas speech doesnt sound like shes listing actual past events. Other languages even reference a vast ocean and a link to the Past. Its most likely her speech is a title drop easter egg.Theres a lot more evidence supporting the downfall timeline than child. Its more substantial too.How does the child timeline explain away Rutos lore from the zora stones?It pretty directly references events that impossible in the child timeline.,zeldaconspiracies,dfhimov,1,t5_2udps
