7690261,0,t1_d3g3c5z,Hey flizz!You know honestly I found simple radar first and it real blew me away how beautiful it was v. default. It is interesting now to see these two battle it out for something free but only be motivated by serving its users with the best possible product.Being an IT student and loving Android Im a man of Material Design not the same as minimalism but still a factor. Ive chosen apps and games over others due to their design and I think that clear radar has great potential to more accurately acquire what Im looking for. PLUS  seeing the creator active in even this little community here is a huge bonus seeing that he cares and wants to hear feedback. Nice talking to you and thanks creator of clear radar! ,CounterStrikeBinds,d3gc0c3,2,t5_37ch5

8403371,0,t1_d5rxys7,First and foremost I managed to slim down the script by removing commands which were used in high redundancy. I than renamed all the aliases to further improve its readabily. Next I created a lot of comments to explain how the script works and how you can make use of it. All in all I have spent some hours on this making sure the code is easy to read well formated and has no unneccesary commands or whatsoever.,CounterStrikeBinds,d5ryu2v,1,t5_37ch5
