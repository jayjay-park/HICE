215536,0,t3_1wkb4d,There is western marxism austro marxism academic marxism orthodox marxism stalinism leninism operaism analytical marxism academic marxism postmarxism ...This are just of the top of my head. The following is merely a very very basic sketch. I guess there are as many different marxist groups as marxist. Marx famously said Ce quil y a de certain cest que moi je ne suis pas Marxiste in short If they are marxists Im certainly not a marxist. There at least three huge groups a academic marxism which was quite influencel especially after  and there are a lot of different shades of it b orthodox marxism which is a term meaning  marxism not opposing the views held by the late sovjet party c unorthodox marxism which is not identical to western marxism and is the term obviously associated in a sense with b. If there is a difference with regard to their respective contents between c and b they differ in their view on an avantgarde party b a strong party is what needed to make communism real  c its not about a party but about a real movement of the pepole on cultureeconomy b economy is what solely matters that means socialism is solely about the question who has the power over the means of production  c capitalism is not limited to the mere question of ownership but has also to deal with questions of alienation and especially ideology. Its quite an interesting question to ask what this differences mean. The core differences are still from the Age of Extremes of  and what is left of marxism is firstly a powerless group of quite a few people  compared to before . If you are interested in marxism start with Marx and get a concept of the key ideas. If you take a marxist view on marxist groups you could say that they dont differ that much nowadays since all of them are trying to get their newspapers and views sold. Because the question is not one of an imminent revolution or at least thats not the most pressing issues if you have a realistic concept of the present and whats to happen afterwards anymore I find a lot of the differences kind of meaningless. Especially if they are put as What does it mean to be x or z I would say that its not about being x or z but about doing things a certain way even though doing means thinking as well. Over here there is still a tradition of leftist student groups and when they say Im a trot its more akin to wearing a specific brand of hats than to anything that matters. In short I suppose your question is too vague indeed.,Marxism,cf2zsmz,4,t5_2qk1b
1917212,0,t1_ck559i9,It depends on what specific interpretative problem you mean. Part of the issue is that for a long time people rarely even touched Capital instead reading Engels.For example one of the oldest interpretative mistakes with Capital is to misread part  not as being about the most fundamental category of capitalist production commodities with a heavy level of abstraction but rather as describing a precapitalist simple commodity production that is as a historical not conceptual argument. This misreading was hugely popular in early th century marxism mainly due to Kautsky simply taking it up from Engels. I dont think this mistake can be attributed to Marxs writing style considering he states very explicitly on the first page of Capital that he isnt talking about precapitalist production in the part on commodities.,Marxism,ckk7lw0,2,t5_2qk1b

5893480,0,t1_cxrvix4,gt human societies are simply complex forms of primitive ape communities which were led by alpha males an epithet that in modern times doesnt require the alpha to be masculine or the Urbourgeoisie.I dont see how you draw this conclusion when our two closest species relatives bonobos and chimpanzees are diametric opposites in terms of aggression conflict resolution and sex gender? do they have gender? roles.  So I think you are constructing a circular narrative about what human nature per se is and how that relates to what we see around us today.  I find a Marxist read that we are determined by our surroundings much more compelling given that it gibes well with basic thought about evolution that we collectively adapt to our surroundings  for better or worse.  On an aside although Marx explicitly eschews it I think there is an underlying idea of human nature undergirding at least Capital and maybe other works too.  Particularly if you conflate the proletariat with humans which is presumably close to what would happen in advanced capitalism under Marxs theorizing.  Others disagree with me though.,Marxism,cxs63u0,1,t5_2qk1b

7368717,0,t1_d2fqbct,gt You quite obviously equated religion to race when you labelled OPs criticism of Islam racist bullshit.That is not equating religion to race. Its not racism because hes attacking a religion its racism because of the way in which hes attacking a group that suffers widespread discrimination in western society. What do you think it means when people are racially discriminated against on the basis of culture? Would you call that equating culture with race? gt I equate that to a shut down on the critique of ideology since Islam is an ideology not a race.Where is his critique of ideology? All Ive seen is racist bullshit about them meaning muslims and eliminating their beliefs. You claim that because Islam is an ideology muslims cant be the victims of racism on the basis of their beliefs but this is just incoherent. I mean how do you define race?,Marxism,d2frt1k,1,t5_2qk1b
7429334,0,t1_d2m9gyq,Youre right about the world we live in but adding on the guilt of succeeding in it makes it even worse. We still have to survive in it and make the best of the one life we have. Every Marxist feels some guilt about participating in capitalism but we have no choice. Continue to do what you can to fight the good fight. Educate all those you can to join the struggle. Dedicate what time you can to the class struggle. But also dont feel bad about your place in the world. Being wealthy and being the bourgeoisie arent always the same things. Strike a healthy balance with your conscience and your life. Your comrades can help you through the tough times. Solidarity my friend.,Marxism,d2mo23c,5,t5_2qk1b
8038233,0,t3_4pbfhm,I have never seen materialistic proof that capitalism is ecologically unsustainable. Most of such arguments assume humans are extranatural beings with a purpose of keeping the nature as it is. They assume permenance in nature and absolute correctness of the present state of the universe.This contains multiple levels of romantic and subjective thought. Basically these are an extension of the gaia religions new ageism greenpeace ideology into marxism.Capitalism when selfcontained within earth does not posess the possibility of an ecological armageddon. If we colonize multiple planets and earth becomes an expendable resource this could change.This doesnt mean capitalism will not harm nature. It will harm as much as it can then the exchange value of wellkept nature will rise to balance out. Overall captalism is bad for nature however it is sustainable. at a pretty ugly point of sustainment. There is no forthcoming ecological armageddon. Those with such claims dont come up with historical material or any other kind of proof. As such they are not marxists.I ran out of time ill cover economical sustainability of capitalism later in a follow up.,Marxism,d4jkmm1,-7,t5_2qk1b

11038971,0,t3_5xj01l,Look at Capital volume  Chapter  Machinery and Large Scale Industry. In footnote  Marx basically gives a brief explanation of his strategy for the chapter of using a historical materialist approach to consider the relationship between humankind as individuals and as societies nature and technologies. A historical materialist approach to the history of science and technology then would not separate the development of science from the development of capitalism. Capitalism produces specific types of technologies for specifically capitalist uses. In this way the history of production and of technology are intertwined. From Ch.  footnote iv.gtBefore his time spinning machines although very imperfect ones had already been used and Italy was probably the country of their first appearance. A critical history of technology would show how little any of the inventions of the th century are the work of a single individual. Hitherto there is no such book. Darwin has interested us in the history of Natures Technology i.e. in the formation of the organs of plants and animals which organs serve as instruments of production for sustaining life. Does not the history of the productive organs of man of organs that are the material basis of all social organisation deserve equal attention? And would not such a history be easier to compile since as Vico says human history differs from natural history in this that we have made the former but not the latter? Technology discloses mans mode of dealing with Nature the process of production by which he sustains his life and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations and of the mental conceptions that flow from them. Every history of religion even that fails to take account of this material basis is uncritical. It is in reality much easier to discover by analysis the earthly core of the misty creations of religion than conversely it is to develop from the actual relations of life the corresponding celestialised forms of those relations. The latter method is the only materialistic and therefore the only scientific one. The weak points in the abstract materialism of natural science a materialism that excludes history and its process are at once evident from the abstract and ideological conceptions of its spokesmen whenever they venture beyond the bounds of their own speciality.Machinery and large scale industry is probably one of the most important chapters in Capital I and it is worth reading in full. That said I can give a quick rundown as it is probably the most important text Marx offers to answer your question.Since any capital investment demands productive use impelled by the mechanism of competition capitalism is impelled towards efficiency. This begins with the organisation and division of labour  under TayloristFordist modes of  production labourers are rationally organsied their tasks specialised and their every movement is made as efficient and productive as possible.  Once labour is made into a virtual machine  that is once workers become cogs in a productive system and nothing more  sophisticated machines can begin to replace the workers themselves. Once for instance a workers function is reduced to simply turning a wheel that function can be replaced by a machine. This is why many technologies are not put to use until longafter they are developed  for instance the steam engine is used in mines for drainage long before it is put to use in production as capitalist production was not sufficiently developed at the time of its inception. Machines by simplifying and deskilling productive labour reduce the bargaining power of the individual worker. Additionally they open up the labour market to a host of unskilled workers including women and children. This tends to drive wages down as instead of having to pay a man a wage which would sustain his family capital owners can instead pay a lesser wage each of his individual family members and receive in return far greater labourpower. Additionally they increase the duration a worker may labour by reducing the physical toll on his or her body over the course of a day.Machines increase the surplus value labour produces both by making labour more efficient and by extending the size of the working population and the length of the working day. This profit is most frequently delivered to the capitalist class but it is worth noting that this hasnt always been so  in North American history for instance the postwar period from about  saw a more or less equal division of productivity gains from mechanisation between capital and labour. Machines then under capitalism serve distinctly capitalist ends. Whereas older modes of production were conservative in their methods preserving older expertise capitalism seeks continuous technological revolution towards ever increasing efficiency. Literature on Marx specifically look at David Harveys Companion to Capital readily available online. Not sure regarding the early history of capitalism and technology  most of what Ive seen recently emphasises the rural origins of capitalism  but a very good read on technology and capitalism is Jonathan Crarys  Late Capitalism and the End of Sleep which looks at digital capitalisms allencompassing reach over our lives.
