7702972,0,t1_d3hdrle,Just played Disasterpiece PT. and bravo. That was super fun. You did a really awesome job with all the event triggers and how they all stringed together. I especially had fun playing this map because I would never have thought to make a map like it and it really opened my mind to the possibilities of SnapMap. I got my brother to play it as well and he had just as much fun. The only two things I saw were super small and Im not even sure if they would impact gameplay. . I killed myself trying to get the chain gun which is totally fine but respawned without the red key card. Im not sure if this was intentional or not and cant even remember if you ever use it again but it felt like I lost some of the maps momentum for a minute while I tried to go retrieve it. After I finished the map I realized that you might be doing that to give bonus points for finishing with keycards andor power cores. . After picking up the C the message and sound effect continued to be triggered when I approached the spot where the C was even before the C respawned. It was a little confusing and as it wasnt apparent if this was due to me doing something wrong was a puzzle in and of itself or if I should just disregard it. Again super small and I probably only even noticed them because I went into the game extra attentive to give feedback. I will definitely recommend it to my peeps and will be checking out No Time To Explain. ,snapmap,d3hryw4,3,t5_38onq
7712729,0,t3_4kyuvv,Do you have other demons already spawned on the map? The game wont spawn any more if theres already  on the map like if you placed demons somewhere else in the level and didnt set them hidden at start.,snapmap,d3ivv6q,1,t5_38onq
7746600,0,t1_d3mqcsc,Part  since I went over the character limitQ Custom Filters. How do they work? Part A Not only can Custom Filters add more filters to a nodes Custom Filter property as described in the previous answer but they can also be used physically in a logic chain to filter specific branches of a chain when the Custom Filter property doesnt exist or where inputsoutputs arent activator specific.Lets say we have one pressure plate that will start a timer but we want each player to have their own separate timer with a time that is unique to them. The Timer node and its outputsinputs do not have a Custom Filter property so we need to create a filter and physically use it in the logic chain.First create a Custom Filter node. It doesnt matter what you name it since we will not be referencing the filter as a whole anywhere. Then create four different Player filters each connected to the main Custom Filter node not to each other. Then edit the properties of each to filter only one player all players are checked by default. So your chain should look like    Custom Filter node gt Player Filter only Player  checked    same Custom Filter node gt Player Filter only Player  checked    same Custom Filter node gt Player Filter only Player  checked    same Custom Filter node gt Player Filter only Player  checkedMove the Custom Filter chain near the Pressure Plate. Then create four separate On Enter outputs from the Pressure Plate connecting each to one of the Player Filters. Then create four separate Timer nodes and connect each Player Filter to the Start Timer input on one of the Timers.Now anytime a player steps on the Pressure Plate they will only trigger the logic chain connected to the Player Filter that is filtering by their player number.Using Custom Filters in this fashion can save a lot of physical space. For example the only way of accomplishing the above example without a Custom Filter chain would be to create four separate Pressure Plates each with their Custom Filter property set to one of the four players. Also note that you can delete the large main Custom Filter node if you only intend to use the small filters in your chains i.e. you dont plan on ever referencing the filter in a Custom Filter property.One additional tip when using custom filters for either method Remember that linear connected filters like in Part  of this question indicate AND branched filters that are not connected to each other like in Part  of this question indicate OR.Q How can I create a boss encounter with a health bar and all that jazz?A You could use the MiniBoss Encounter node but the options for that spawner are extremely limited. Its much better use an explicit demon or a Single Demon Encounter node and edit the health and damage values manually in the properties.As for a health bar the logic chain will look something like this    Demon gt On AI Spawned gt Show Health gt Objective Objective Text custom boss nameThis will create an objective on the lefthand side of your HUD showing the bosses name defined in the Objective node not the name of the DemonSpawner itself and its health. There is currently no way to manually enable the floating curved health bar that some spawners automatically put on tougher demons.To give the boss a floating iconname use a POI. First define what the POI looks like using the POI Settings node and Set Active gt POI Settings using whatever trigger youre also using the spawn the boss. Then to actually make the POI appear    Demon gt On AI Spawned gt Set Point of Interest gt DemonJust make sure the POI number there are  is the same in both your Set POI input and the POI Settings node.It also would be a good idea to lockdown the room the boss is fought in. Create a Module node in the boss module. Then    Module gt On Player Entered Run Once True gt Start Lockdown gt Module    Demon gt On Killed gt End Lockdown gt ModuleQ How do I prevent demons from walking into a specific module?A You can enable set the Custom Filter in the module doors properties to Any Player but this will only prevent AI from opening the door if its already open they can walk through with impunity. For some reason there is no AI Blocking Volume to compliment the included Player Blocking Volume.The best way Ive found to accomplish this is to use a Box Trigger Volume sized large enough to fit a doorway combined with Teleport Destinations placed just outside the doorway on the side of the door the demons should stay on.    Box Trigger Custom Filter Any AI Reset Delay . gt On Entered gt Teleport To gt Teleport DestinationIf youre using the AI Conductor on your map expanding the Box Trigger to encompass the entire module will prevent demons from spawning in that module WITHOUT halting demon spawning completely if the Conductor wave starts while the player is in the module which is what happens if you use the AI Conductor Inhibitor Volume object instead.Q How do I scale AI difficulty with the number of players?A Create a new integer variable with a default of  max of  and min of  and name it Player Count. Create a Player Proxy node and connect the two as follows    Player Proxy gt On Match Joined gt Add  gt Integer Name Player Count    same Player Proxy gt On Match Left gt Subtract  gt same Integer Name Player CountNext create a single AI Proxy and construct a chain similar to the following    AI Proxy gt On AI Spawned gt Test gt Integer Compare LHS Player Count RHS  gt On Equals gt Apply Buff Health  gt same AI Proxy    same AI Proxy gt same On AI Spawned gt same Test gt Integer Compare LHS Player Count RHS  gt On Equals gt Apply Buff Health  gt same AI Proxy    same AI Proxy gt same On AI Spawned gt same Test gt Integer Compare LHS Player Count RHS  gt On Equals gt Apply Buff Health  gt same AI Proxy    same AI Proxy gt same On AI Spawned gt same Test gt Integer Compare LHS Player Count RHS  gt On Equals gt Apply Buff Health  gt same AI ProxyPreview of how this might look You can add additional Apply Buff inputs to modify damage as well though personally I think demons deal high enough damage that simply increasing their health is a decent enough boost to difficulty.Note that this method by default applies to all demons that spawn so it will overwrite custom health settings for enemies you wanted to be even stronger like a boss. I wont go into detail since I already delved into custom filters above but basically youll just want to set all bosses to a specific team then create a custom filter that filters by AI that are NOT on that team and use that custom filter in the AI Proxy above.Q What cant I do in SnapMap?A Below is a list of things that it seems like you should be able to do but currently cant. Detect headshot killsheadshot damage. Customize demon AI behavior on anything thats not an explicit demon. Manually enable floating health bars on specific demonsencounters. Remove all weapons from a players inventory players must always have one weapon. Trigger or otherwise dynamically change a modules environment property. Have more than  different custom POIs Have one custom POI appear on more than one object at a time Respawn an explicit demon object Assign unique ammo to a weapon like how the BFG has special unique ammo pickups in the campaign. Change the Demon Runes demon race to anything other than a Baron of Hell Multiplydivideaddsubtract two different integernumber variables and output the result to a third integernumber variable. Modify damageammunition amount on a weaponbyweapon basis. Detect what percentage of health a player has.,snapmap,d3mqd6w,4,t5_38onq

I think its eye does massive critical damage if you hit it Ill work on balancing issues. Thanks! Spectres must be coming from the survival waves?

7769820,0,t1_d3pc062,Thats not what I meant but I DID try what I said in my own snapmap and it doesnt seem to work reliably. The problem is theres no way to set where the miniboss event spawns.

Killed my way to the first door with pressure plate in front of it funny enough I didnt step on it I just grabbed the red key card and moved forward got the grey flag got to the lasers and stopped ... Saw something to jump to to the right ... But my finger slipped and so did I... Fell to my death... Spawned me in the weird room with a blue door  consoles and a locked door I used to console closest to the regular door to unlock it... And tried to fight my way to the grey flag again but died... So I respawned again at the first place.. This time I made my way to the flag and the door above it was locked... So I turned back and died...ended up spawning in the room with  consoles  and the blue door.. Something happend and all of the doors are locked and after I used the consoles nothing happened... So I stand around a minute looking for a way out... And barons start spawning... I die... A lot... Then quit... Sorry...,snapmap,d557g55,1,t5_38onq

8418193,0,t1_d5tnyfy,Im using an Integer to differentiate between the difficulty settings.When the Player selects the desired difficulty an Integer Compare is activated and simply cranks up the enemies damage output via AI Proxy.If you can afford the extra memory you may also add additional demons or reduce the available Pickups on the map.

8551796,0,t1_d6a77rb,Its the Stormtrooper effect from Star Wars.  You have all these projectiles whizzing around but they arent aimed that well and its completely intentional almost like set dressing to make the scene look more frantic that it actually is.Even Demon has a role and the way they play off other Demons roles is what makes the game work.  So a Revenant on its own is no big deal.  But if you have a CyberMancubus standing around shooting goop that blocks the players path that Revenent becomes a lot more dangerous.,snapmap,d6ajpz9,3,t5_38onq

8649824,0,t3_4y7fnj,Do you care how precise it is? One way to make it more efficient is to combine some of those destructible boxes into a larger square. Other areas might include sacrifices to other precision points. Do you care that they only get a point if  entire mushroom is destroyed? Or that X number of pixels are destroyed? X pixels will save you on network . Also having a remote trigger system for the sounds might help. ,snapmap,d6mu9t1,1,t5_38onq

9768862,0,t1_dah68xy,Is there a proxy that compares values automatically and repeatedly until a condition is met without interaction from the player? Instead of setting each barrel to test the integer compare manually on explosion id like to just create one node that checks without me having to press a button on a console or hitting something. I used one of those transparent boxes that triggers when you pass through but that would only trigger the teleporter if the player happens to walk through it again after destroying all the barrels.,snapmap,dah88vv,1,t5_38onq

10002488,0,t3_5iu8rs,I wish I could say yes but I dont see a good way of accomplishing it. If you restrict the game to no more than two weapons and turn off AI ammo drops on kills and weapon drop on player death it is possible to track every time you shoot and every time you pick up ammo.But currently in SnapMap we cant output the current ammo to an integer. And we cant filter for the current weapon the player has selected. I think these two things are necessary if we want to use the SnapMap logic to solve this problem without overly constraining the game play.,snapmap,dbbcpqp,3,t5_38onq
