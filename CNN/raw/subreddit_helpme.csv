8454829,0,t3_4vgmt3,Okay Id strongly advise you stop vaping. Just dont. Its great if youre trying to quit smoking actual cigarettes.Now learn how to say no. Real friends would never pressure you into doing something you didnt want to do.I wouldnt worry about the alcohol or weed too much theyre relatively harmless in the quantities you wouldve consumed them in. That said if you feel that theyre having a negative impact on your life then stop. ,helpme,d5ye0cg,1,t5_2qpmh

9984363,0,t3_5hume6,gt I hold a firm belief in never doing anything unless it makes you happy or will contribute to your happiness.I commend your idealism but this isnt how life works. Reaching your goals is long hard and takes incredible amounts of forethought. Much of it is tedious work toiling at something you probably dont enjoy to help position yourself to actually achieve your goals. The idea of quitting your part time job should never have even crossed your mind without a backup plan already in place. Youre  youve finished college and you live with a significant other that means that by all definitions you are an adult. That means another person also depends on you for their livelihood. You owe it to them and to yourself to consider your actions before you take them.It sounds like you have serious issues sticking to one goal. You thought you wanted to be in education but you figured out too late that you didnt. You say you want to be a voice actor but then you immediately say you want to pursue another degree on top of the degree youre not currently using. So whats your goal? It sounds like youre just as confused about it as I am. I think you have some serious soulsearching to do before you reach a point where you should decide to throw more money at your education.The fact of the matter is that sometimes a lot of the time you have to do things you hate to meet your responsibilities and actually work towards where you want to be. Quitting your job when it gets hard isnt what adults do. Choosing to leave money on the table to spare themselves some work isnt what adults do.I commend your idealism but youre acting like a child.Consider what you want what you need what those around you need and how youll get there before you do something.,helpme,db8zo96,3,t5_2qpmh
