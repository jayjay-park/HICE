11575059,0,t3_656bm8,ill give two examples one is a meme and one isnt. a pinch and a punch for the first day of the month is a childrens rhyme which spreads like an organism in that the information the phrase and the action pinching and punching replicates from one child to the next. an example of what isnt a meme is the play itself. play is an evolved response to facilitate learning how to move think etc. children who play more learn more and thus survive longer to replicate. this gets confusing because the memes interact with our biological wants. this tends to be the best way to replicate after all.this means the divison is often disputed. after all think on this what we would be without a culturally replicating unit a meme? that is a notion bizarre within itself because humans evolved to learn from each other. After tinkering with the idea of memetics now i think it is a useful concept for understanding learning and cultural evolution but it still does not describe this divide between how we are biologically programmed and how we are culturally programmed. it also has no real connection to neuroscience which is really required for a full picture view. As they say... more research is required.,memetics,dg81ey0,3,t5_2qi7s
