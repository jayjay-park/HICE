1905222,0,t1_ckinzym,It would be difficult but what kind of GM would I be if I didnt put effort into making an interesting campaign? And yea it would depend highly on the player but the player in question I seriously doubt would do it for the purposes of minmaxing etc and is purely interested in the roleplay opportunity,DarkHeresy,ckirmue,1,t5_2xfdh

11497197,0,t3_5rt06i,I did the same thing I started with an old fashioned Warhammer fantasy session years ago.All I can say for heresy is make standing out characters. Always keep your rank and powers close.Players thing big but they shouldnt be able to feel powerful. Make it evil the sessions.Dont make missions easy and dont hand out exp.Commissar  Salutes you. Blam FOR NOT SALUTING ME!!!,DarkHeresy,dfz7geo,2,t5_2xfdh
