91704,0,t1_ceouj7k,Its less about developing QBs and more about getting one. In all of his time in Arizona he should had been able to get a new QB but was never able to. He had chances in drafts he traded a probowl CB for one who failed miserably he brought in a FA. Nothing he ever did fixed the position despite it being the most important to fix.And lets be honest about Rivers. Hes always been very talented. Last year he wasnt borderline awful he had the th highest rating in the league. Nowhere near great but just above average. This year he massively improved but I have to wonder how much that has to do with the guy Mike McCoy the guy who made Kyle Orton look like a decent starter and just left Peyton as much as it does with Whisenhunt.That said Im somewhat excited about Whisenhunt.

1282808,0,t1_cidvvv9,I would like to agree with you on that last sentence but it would take a lot more than one season to change a mindset. Just look at the  season from a few years ago. After it was over people just fell back into the same routine of overlooking us. More recently we are just two years removed from a season where we missed out on the playoffs because of play in situations not going the way we needed. We have a very localized market and everyone even NFL.com who should be supporting us as part of their product uses that as an excuse to write us off as an afterthought or punchline. It would take a lot of consistent success for us to gain enough of a national fanbase to ward off the Titans who comments that we just havent been able to achieve.

This is a point where morale and motivation for the team are probably at an alltime low and they need a swift kick in the ass more than anything but the guy who can do that the best may be done for the year.

2070302,0,t1_cl2z6n1,I dont know man...inconsistent is absolutely the best adjective you can pin to Jake Locker at this point.  He straight up lost us games in weeks  and .  Granted both of those teams are actually good.  But he looked like a fucking amateur.  He looked decent in week .  He looked good in week  last year against the Jets but looked pretty sub par in the first two weeks against Pitt and Houston.  He was decent against SD in week  and orchestrated some key drives to win late.His career ceiling has been pretty good.  His best  games are just decent games by ANYONEs standards.  Hes never had a  yard game never had  passing TD....hes never had a real gamebreaker performance.  So saying he plays at a high level is a stretch to me.  And his floor is low.  Like...shouldnt have a job low.  Missing open guys on a regular basis inability to complete anything low.  So yeah I cant see how you can say he plays at a high level.  Hes inconsistent and occasionally decent. ,Tennesseetitans,cl2zbo5,3,t5_2s5fm
2076939,0,t1_cl2yn85,Simple answer  leadership.This Titans team needs veteran leadership. Lockers leadership and just his presence within the team is very valuable to the team in my opinion.As much as Id like for him to be the guy Im just having difficulty believing it myself anymore. His performances paint a picture of career as a backup QB. Similar to a Kyle Orton  hes got some talent and can surprise you sometimes but for the most part hes a nd option.I believe he is still valuable to the Titans because of his intangibles and the impact he has on the team. Would he be better if this was his nd or rd year in Wizs system? Sure but we dont have time to go through that again. I think most of us can agree that hes probably not our franchise QB at this point which means were going to continue to look for one. Maybe Mett can be that guy? Maybe we draft a guy next year? Either way I think Locker would be very important in helping mold that new QB while also starting at QB until that younger one is ready. And besides what better option do we have right now? I just feel that Locker is the kind of football player you like to keep around if possible but we cant rely on him to start  games so hes probably the back up QB.However Id be shocked if that were to actually happen. Lockers a competitive guy and I dont doubt for a second that he believes he can be a good starting QB so hell probably move on to another team in hopes of rejuvenating himself and his career. I wish him all the success in the world.,Tennesseetitans,cl3toga,1,t5_2s5fm

There were multiple other good OGs available later in the draft that year.I agree with most of your points but a line is shit without proper coaching. No one would have thought that Andy Levitre would be doing as bad as he is doing right now. He was amazing with the Bills we were all stoked that he brought Andy in. Also I recall begging for the Titans to pick up Chance Warmack because he was easily one of the best guards in college at the time. He came from Alabama which was in the tough SEC of course so his talent is obviously there but this Line has lacked discipline and that is all on coaching. ,Tennesseetitans,clojifo,1,t5_2s5fm

Second while it did suck to see all the Steeler fans most of them are just doing it because it is cool to wave the towels.

2463467,0,t3_2nrdto,none of this should be taken as a joke Im using terminology that is often geared toward the RB positionWe shouldnt do this. Hes still relatively young but has taken a real beating over his career with the Ravens. A running back has a shelf life and can only get hit so many times. He has been the feature back without much support from any rotation guys. In every season where he played in all  games  out of his  he has had carry totals over . The wheels have to come off sometime.Moreover he plays the same position Sankey does in regard to skill set. Hes not a power back or a scat back hes a guy who is good at everything but a specialist at nothing like Sankey. Would we bench Sankey? Would we try and rotate them? Because we know how well swapping RBs before they can get into a rhythm works. And what kind of money would he command? Yeah he got released unceremoniously from his team that doesnt mean he wont still expect to be paid like the big money running back he was before. He hasnt even missed a whole season I doubt he had much of a chance to regress his skill to a point where he signs a midlevel contract with a team that doesnt have good immediate prospects to win after coming from a Super Bowl contender.And as for what it would do to the Titans Ive already endured the thug and convict jokes when we were in the Pacman Young and Britt era Id rather not have the only focus of our team be that we signed a wife beater. He would bring a media circus and that would be the only show in town so you know everybodys going to focus on that. ,Tennesseetitans,cmg6of7,1,t5_2s5fm

I dont carry any of that hate he brought football to my city and into my life but I can sympathize.

You can also factor in the versatility played every position on the line and character Bart Starr Man of the Year winner.

We probably need to show some southern hospitality and invite some opponents on rSaints pretty soon.Rather than ask a question I thought Id share how your team sent me to my team in the spirit of togetherness.Please understand I have nothing against Nashville as a city Ive been a couple times and its pretty nice.  Ive had some harrowing moments in Memphis but thats not really relevant.I didnt grow up a Saints fan.  I grew up an Oilers fan.  I hated your team for a long time.  Rooted against you in the Superbowl generally hoped for you to go  that kind of thing I did still love Air McNair but in secret.  Eventually I moved to Louisiana and started watching the Saints right before NFL football came back to Houston.For a while there I never thought Id come back to the NFL.  Before Houston Id lived in Cleveland and LA and at some point I just got tired rooting for laundry.Im glad Im a Saints fan now.  The last decade and a half have been great even when theyve been terrible.So thanks I guess for my Saints fandom.,Tennesseetitans,cr7a34c,4,t5_2s5fm

4367117,0,t3_3b17hb,Permalink here for TwitterTo Nissan North America and Tennessee Titans As a fan of the Titans I was delighted to hear that Nissan would be purchasing the naming rights to our riverside home. Tennessee takes great pride in being the home of Nissans production facility and North American HQ. The merge of two great icons in Tennessee is a naturally great decision for all parties involved Nissan the Titans organization but also fans of both franchises. However the name of our football home is one thing we hold in great regard. And with the extended period the naming rights are rumored to be we fans feel our voice needs to be heard on the matter. As you may or may not know the Titans are named in reflection of a long held nickname of Nashville The Athens of the South. This can be viewed within the city through the classical architecture its culture the education brought by institutions such as Belmont and Vanderbilt but most evidently another result of Nashvilles nickname a replica of the Parthenon containing Athena originally constructed in . It is due to these thematic memes throughout the city that we humbly request our football home to be named Nissan Coliseum. Beyond the obvious Athens theme we feel Nissan Coliseum is better suited for a number of reasons listed below.Nissan has connection to the theme with the Titan Truck. A powerful heroic truck and team deserve a name that reflects their traits.Nissan Stadium lacks the creativity and innovation that has driven both Nashville and Nissan.Nissan Coliseum sounds better and rolls of the tongue better than Nissan StadiumThere is already a Nissan Stadium in Yokohama Japan. We would like to avoid any confusion between the two.The fans greatly appreciate everything Nissan has done throughout Tennessee but we have to ask for one small detail. Please name the Titans home to Nissan Coliseum. Doing so would bring great joy to the  people who watch our warriors week in and week out. Thank you for your time.Titan Up!Titan and Nissan fans,Tennesseetitans,cshwqmw,3,t5_2s5fm

I think Mariota is a great pick up and our best qb since McNair and Moon. We still have a lot of issues we need to fix oline is gerbage rbs are unimpressive wrs need an ass kicking. Whats sad is that TE is our only strength position on offense. Our front office hasnt been drafting great till these past  drafts imo and finding hungry UDFA thats where we need to kill it.

5357587,0,t1_cvwhcoe,He also let ATV walk. And our last two drafts hasnt been that amazing either. This draft class is good but mostly because Mariota seems like the right answer we have been searching for over a decade. DGB has a ton of potential but so did Justin Hunter. Justin Hunter was a bad pick obviously. Chance Warmack hasnt been a world breaker at guard. Other than Avery and Taylor our last years draft has been pedestrian at best. BWW and Coty were bad picks. I dont know Ruston should be able to hit better in drafts then he has been. Youre right about resigning Morgan and Casey and bringing in Orakpo.

It was like he was trying to remain professional and stoic at all times. Thats not necessarily required for a football coach in the same way it is for someone who manages in an office... It came off like he didnt care or wasnt concerned. Whisenhunt from day one has been defensive with the media here. Sometimes warranted sometimes not.

Im a dummy. Anyway you make some good points and its not like the article is rock solid. I still think Hunter was a massive reach given the other holes we couldve filled with a pick that high and his issues with drops in college.

6142864,0,t1_cynv5ee,True it makes it harder but it doesnt mean it cant happen. There have been games where one guy has gotten a significant amount of the carries and could have led to  yards with a better line. Also plenty of other teams have committee approaches that lead to  yard rushers. The Patriots have had good success with this Bills sometimes due to injuries the Cards etc. Even back in Cjs first year when him and Lendale shared carries we had two guys with way more than our lead rusher had this season.

6227873,0,t1_cyxij34,I tried to use the shorthand for the comment but if you want to get specific fine. A general manager will look significantly worse and will have his ability to evaluate talent called into question because the players are not performing or improving on the field as a result of poor coaching and player development. If the coachs regression of the team is dramatic enough it may cause both him and the general manager to be fired simultaneously. Should the coach be fired but not the general manager but the deficit the old coach left behind was great enough that a new coach brought in doesnt see a stark turnaround that may then result in the general manager being fired as well.Conversely if a general manager is poor at talent evaluation and doesnt supply a coach with the talent sufficient to putting together a winning unit it will handicap his ability to produce a good on field product. This will cause the coach to appear to be of a lower quality than he actually is because he is playing behind the eight ball of not having players of performing or developing at a satisfactory level for the NFL. It is mutually beneficial for both parties to be competent and having one party be of lesser quality can negatively affect the others job performance. ,Tennesseetitans,cyxjif8,2,t5_2s5fm

If Schwenke could somehow find a way to stay healthy for the rest of his career dont know how he could hes gotten hurt at some point every year hes been here he could feasibly turn it around but I just wouldnt be willing to take that chance with Marcus needing all the protection he can get along with a good complimentary run game.

Titans trade st overall pick to the San Fransisco ers for the th overall pick the Niners nd round choice and their first round pick in  ers select Jared Goff QB California  Berkley  Chip Kellys ghost strikes again despite his lack of GM powers as the Niners are able to offload Colin Kaepernick but RGIII goes to the Broncos and the Niners are left with just Blaine Gabbert on their depth chart as a potential starter. . Cleveland Browns select Carson Wentz QB North Dakota State  Cleveland is desperate for answers at QB and if nothing else Wentzs personality will be a breath of fresh air under center after enduring the Johnny Manziel experiment.. San Diego Chargers select Laremy Tunsil OT Ole Miss  Despite the loss of Weddle the Chargers need to protect Philip Rivers and give him a ground game and Tunsil is the best player on the board with the ability to do that.. Dallas Cowboys select Joey Bosa DEOLB Ohio State  Dallas is in a position where they can take the BPA at number  which is kind of a rare thing. Bosa would be a fine addition to a Cowboys defense that could use another pass rusher.. Jacksonville Jaguars select Myles Jack OLB UCLA  Jacksonville filled most of the other holes on their defense through free agency but itll be hard for them to pass up an athletic linebacker like Jack.. Baltimore Ravens select LaQuon Treadwell WR Ole Miss  I think this spot might be prime for a trade if a team really wants to move up for Ramsey as Baltimore could likely get Treadwell later in the first round than six but with the signing of Eric Weddle WR is by far the biggest need in Baltimore. Treadwell makes sense for Baltimore in Round .. Tennessee Titans select Jalen Ramsey FS Florida State  Tennessee hasnt even really sniffed at a FS in free agency despite the release of veteran Michael Griffin and Ramsey is the prospect who makes the most sense at  even with Ronnie Stanley still on the board and a need at RT. Ramsey will make the Titans secondary a feared commodity for years to come.. Philadelphia Eagles select Ezekiel Elliot RB Ohio State  with the trade of DeMarco Murray to Tennessee Philly needs a new lead back and Elliot is the kind of player who could compliment the Eagles QB situation very well.. Tampa Bay Buccaneers select Vernon Hargreaves III CB Florida  Tampas defense was horrendous last season and Hargreaves would be a nice step to rectifying that. . New York Giants select Ronnie Stanley OT Notre Dame  Will Beatty has been cut and the Giants need help at tackle.

And as such Im not surprised that we didnt court Woods all that strongly for awhile. Hes definitely not above having depth brought in or even being beaten out but I think his presence is strong enough to hold off drafting another NT.I could understand taking a nose if they traded back in the second like they did last year and anything past the second is fair game if the value lines up. But at the top of the second even more so with the Pats having a forfeited pick there has to be a better value at a position of greater need. I mean I would be shocked if the best value player at the very top of the second was a nose to the point that we would take him. Especially because there dont seem to be too many athletic monsters at NT like weve seen the last couple years with guys like Poe and Shelton.

7288478,0,t1_d26me7m,I hope this is exactly how it happened... Also lets add that Fisher is once again helping the Titans by staying quiet because the Browns could stay if the QB they want is still there. ,Tennesseetitans,d26ng1z,6,t5_2s5fm
7307309,0,t3_4febsl,As everyone knows the Titans have a lot of needs but of these needs a RT and NT are the most important to address in the draft. We have Byron fucking bell with no depth and RT and we have only  NT who was a back up in Pittsburgh and who no one wanted in free agency. These  positions have to be address in the first  rounds. Other than that I would say ILB CB WR OG and depth at DE all have equal importance. People have good arguments to draft any of these positions with the remaining picksBut to touch on the WR in the second round. I think our WR production last year is not a good way to judge our WRs. Our season consisted of a  games that our back up QB played in the most sacks most hurries and the learning curve of a rookie QB. It would not have mattered if we had Calvin Johnson and Dez. The only routes we could run were quick slants because our QBs had no time. However I do think we only have an average WR group. But I think we need  more year to see  things.  Can DGB be a number one threat or even a number  Can Kendall Wright stay healthy and prove his importance to the team Finally Can Matthews prove himself as a starter because Harry Ds time is numbered in this leagueBUT my final point is that yes we do draft a WR in the nd but for a reason no one has brought up. We should not draft an outside WR because I dont think there is really anyone that stands out that much. I think DGB is going to be a lot better than any guy we bring in including Treadwell. AND we have  first round picks next year that we can use to address a WR if DGB and Matthews dont work out. But I do think we should draft a slot receiver. Because this is Kendall Wrights final year on his contract. And what might irritate some is that he is our highest paid offensive player this year. He is also going to command big bucks at the end of the season.  To sum it up the ideal situation I see happening is  Draft a slot this year that may not be as good as Kendall Wright but good enough and could start next year in the slot. Then we lose Kendalls large contract at the end of the year.  Hope DGB or Matthews is a superstar so we can cut Douglas at the end of the year and save . million in salary. He only has  dead money Hope there is a Julio Jones sitting in next years draft that we can use one of our  first round picks on. This gives would give us a very bright WR group with hardly any money spent on them. ,Tennesseetitans,d28shwi,0,t5_2s5fm

7387642,0,t1_d2hwhfo,I would say  of those teams that are the consistent winners have had goodgreat QBs the entire time they were winning. Typically a great QB can carry crappy defenses and even rather crappy offenses to the playoffs.  Over the history of the NFL I would venture to guess that a majority of those QBs came from a team hitting rock bottom and drafting them high unless youre one of the luckiest franchises of all time like the Patriots or Packers.I think that sometimes it simply takes bottoming out the franchise for a few years to get a Marcus Mariota and a couple elite players for another year or two. Thats what it takes to build the foundation of a team.  It sucks witnessing it.  I hated these past two seasons but honestly its what Ive been wanting for a while.  Ive watched this team hover around . for years and I really feel like I can say with confidence now that nothing is worse than that.  Even being  doesnt feel worse.  I have more hope now after one of our worst seasons of all time than I did after going say  with no real Super Bowl chance on the horizon.I really think that Mariota has the ability and drive to take us to a Super Bowl. I can only hope that we FINALLY learn how to draft and build a good team around him.  If Jon Robinson cant do it with this wealth of draft picks over the next two seasons he shouldnt be in the NFL anymore.  This is our chance to get back to our early s form and be even better.  We cant let this opportunity slip away.,Tennesseetitans,d2hxa84,3,t5_2s5fm

We just dont have anyone on the team whos that good.  Granted if Rishard and Tajae come out ballin then obviously this grade shoots up but this is my initial reaction.  Rishard Mathews wasnt our WR in anyones mind until the past couple weeks.Our entire WR corps combined for  yards and  TD last year.

9076339,0,t1_d82sxr3,I tried to be optimistic about Robiskie and Mularkeys offensive gameplan going into the season.  I really did.  I havent been able to watch the game tape for this game yet but Im assuming its more of the same.  I want this offense to evolve but Im not sure that its going to.  I pray it does because I dont want to completely start over next season in a new offense once again.I posted this in another thread but I think its relevant hereI dont think this group of receivers would actually be terrible if put in the correct situation. Thats why I specifically said This may be the worst group of receivers weve had at winning vs. We have a bunch of short to midrange receivers that have brains that could run more complicated route trees in formations that would allow them to get open despite physical limitations. We dont have great speed size or extreme quickness to get open. However I think we have a couple of really good route runners and some guys with good hands. Unfortunately were just running big package formations putting a couple receivers on the outside and letting them run curl routes. Its not fooling anyone and we dont have Julio Jones out there to come down with those contested catches every single time.Go back and watch the Packers last year after they lost Jordy Nelson in the preseason. This article sums it up better than I ever could. Despite Aaron Rodgers being one of the best QBs in the game arguably all time great it didnt matter how good he was if his receivers werent getting open. Their offense continued to struggle because McCarthy was too boneheaded to admit his isolation routes werent working. Now go watch a team like New England. Theyve been overcoming shortcomings at WR for years. If you ever get access to the All film watch the intricacies of the formations and the route trees their receivers run.  Theyre crossing guys rubbing and doing all sorts of things to break people open. Whisenhunt was even doing some of that stuff here and its why Mariota looked much better with him. The only thing Ive seen us do here is run a pick on a route to get a slant open. That is literally the only scheming Ive seen to get a receiver open.Its just so frustrating to watch because I feel like were throwing every one of Mariotas strengths and our receivers strengths in the toilet.,Tennesseetitans,d82tueg,10,t5_2s5fm

9103285,0,t1_d85yftz,gt I hate to say it man but I think this is the most unbelievably apologetic review Ive seen from you. Sorry you feel that way man.gt I also have the All and I wish there was some way we could get that video into this sub. The offensive scheme was absolutely fine. We ran  pass plays with  wide receivers lined up  plays with  guys running routes of some sort receiving options as you call them. Those numbers are deceptive.  Many times those extra  guys running routes were not releasing from their blocks until long after the pass was out of Mariotas hands.gt So the whole notion that were running a power running offense is just false. Its selective memory. We have power running plays and we very often add in spread out pass plays. We also try to pass the ball from running formations. Its exactly what we should be doing.I dont think I said we were running a power offense.  I think I said we keep claiming to be a run team in reference to all the exotic smashmouth stuff.  You can correct me if Im wrong on that.  I may have written it.  Im also not sure how any of this is selective memory since I wrote all this AS I was watching the plays. gt Time and time again Marcus didnt throw it to the right guy or didnt make an accurate throw.If you read where I was breaking down the plays I noted this several times although not as many as you think.  Mariota wasnt his best that day.  Ive said that a couple times throughout this thread.gt  He stares down running backs and TEs on so many plays.First read offense?  We cant be sure.  Some of those plays the other receivers start jogging routes like its never going to them in the first place.  Either way young QBs tend to stare down receivers.  Its something that they need to work on and develop over time especially in a brand new system.gt  We actually had plenty of deep patterns inserted throughout. He just missed them.  of those werent open.  I know youll disagree with me after you trash our receivers and then keep insinuating theyre getting open.  Im not sure how you can choose both.gt Not too many plays have multiple routes going  yards down the field.Go watch any other modern NFL offense.  Even the Titans offense under Whisenhunt had plenty of routes at that depth.  You obviously dont want to run them all the time but were pretty much only stretching the defense with a Go or a Post occasionally.  The depth that we get on our routes is laughable.gt First play of the game Tajae Sharpe is  on  on the outside and has the guy beat. You chalk that up as no separation in your analysis but thats jive. It was a bad decision not to punish that CB in a  on  matchup.I cant remember off the top of my head but I thought a safety was coming over the top?  Either way even when Tajae looks like he has a step I dont trust that the DB is running full speed.  Maybe I was wrong on this whole play though.  I cant remember.  As I said before Marcus didnt play extremely well throughout the day.  This whole post was mainly a critique of the offensive scheme.gt The fumble you didnt have a problem with? Makes a good decision to scramble. Has a horrible fumble. I dont blame him for not sliding in that scenario. I do still have a problem with him fumbling.I never said I dont have problem with the fumble.  I said I dont have a problem with him scrambling and putting himself in a situation where he could potentially fumble.  I think its a problem he can fix.gt The first interception you put on the coach for poor clock management? Did you watch that entire drive during the game?  The entire team had no clue what they were doing.  That includes Mariota the receivers and the linemen.  He shouldnt have thrown the ball and it was an even worse route but that whole series is one the coaching staff.  It was absolutely awful.gt People seem to speak so highly of the Ken Whisenhunt system from last year which is funny because I remember what they were saying then but Whizs offense was entirely based on one read scripted throws with hot routes. Some of it was based on that yes.  As is every competent offense in the NFL.  But I encourage you to go back and watch Mariota go through his progressions on dozens of throws last year.  You can claim Im making it up but I promise you its there.gt Which is exactly what youre proclaiming this offense is. But it isnt! Marcus just doesnt get through his progressions well enough. So often he should have went to the next guy or the guy after that. And when he actually does go through a progression or two.If you run three curl patterns on the same play what progression is there to go through?  Yeah we run some plays that give him options but theyre not open most of the time.  Then he looks for the checkdown but the defense is so pushed forward on all these shallow routes that theres nothing there for them.  Not sure what else hes supposed to do.gt Amaro ran a stick not a dig and Mariota looked at Henry he was covered then he threw it to the TE. This is classic Mariota. RB covered? Better hit the TE. It was the right throw but it was nothing but a decent throw to an easy target over the middle...the exact sort of play you hate on with such vigor when it doesnt work.Looked like a dig either way its irrelevant.  If our RB was the first look on that play that says about all I need to know.  I saw a QB look off the defense and deliver a good ball.  I dont know why youre so opposed to the idea of Mariota looking off defenses when he did it multiple times during his rookie season.  Heck he looked off a safety last week on the TD throw to Delanie.gt  But the fact is Marcus has a very difficult time hitting guys in stride and finding open players outside of the numbers. I disagree with this whole heartedly.  Hes not completely consistent with it but given more opportunities in better situations like last year he didnt seem to have a problem with it.gt This offense isnt there to hide deficiencies we dont have. Its there to protect him from his deficiencies.I disagree with this and I dont think I have to rehash why.gt And hes still turning it over every week. Already addressed this in my original post about pressing.gt What is your actual grade of his performance? Standard AF scale or  whatever you wanna do. What do you grade Marcus at in this game?In this game for what he was given a C simply for the turnovers the bad miss on Tajae and the missed deep ball on Rishard.  Im not really sure what a grade is good for considering context. It was definitely his worst game of the season.  Never tried to deny that.  ,Tennesseetitans,d862hhp,12,t5_2s5fm

But its a really pivotal point in the entire series even if it was quite uneven it still had the weight youd want from it and was broadly satisfying. Return of the Jedi didnt really have that it felt like a let down as a conclusion Vaders sudden consistence didnt really sit right with me and Ewoks annoy the hell out of me.     I wouldnt say there is a huge difference and there is probably an element of ROJ feeling like a let down after  really good movies and ROS being slightly redeeming after  poor movies but I think the two are pretty close together.   ,Tennesseetitans,d91tyw1,3,t5_2s5fm

9405456,1,t3_59fljf,This is the stupidest question Ive seen on here in a while.  Well done.Mularkey is doing a good job.  Weve improved under his watch exponentially.  Our roster is better.  Our team is more productive.  We fight for  quarters every game havent seen this in years.Regardless of the outcome of this season Mike should and will get at least next season as well.  Robiskie?  Maybe maybe not.  But we have no reason to change anything really.  Our problems are with execution and lack of depth in certain areas.  Scheming and game planning have been just fine in nearly every facet.  Of course there are exceptions but by and large were so much better off now.,Tennesseetitans,d987hmt,4,t5_2s5fm
9409392,0,t1_d98k3ws, Baloney. We have several options besides trading him. He is a second year QB. It is entirely reasonable to coach him through his weaknesses and eleminate or fix those weaknesses. We have the potential to field a team that can utilize a power run scheme to dominate clock and opponents but can shift to fast hitting spread offense run by a top notch QB. The only limitation is our ability to coach our players.Now I am not saying that the current coaching staff could do that but to only give them  games with one of the worst rosters in the NFL to decide if they can do that is ludicrous.  I think we could be playoff contenders next year if the coaching staff can utilize mariota andor we can get the WRs to win the  on  matchups the current system requires. ,Tennesseetitans,d98pfua,3,t5_2s5fm

9554531,0,t3_5bogod,Heres the deal. Marcus had a game with too many big turnovers. Period. Three turnovers is too many. It ruined what could have been a great day. I still think Marcus is the future. He still has to cut down on turnovers. Hes got eight picks and four fumbles through nine games. That aint great. But hes young if hes still turning it over like this in year four weve got a problem. I can criticize him and still be every bit the fan that anyone else is. If he took better care of the ball wed probably be a game over . instead of a game below. That said if we end the season with seven or more wins Ill be happy. Six or less and Ill be pissed. Marcus is not our biggest issue or anywhere near it but he isnt above criticism. Our secondary blows. We are a true number one receiver and a. Interior lineman away from a complete offense. Our young quarterback needs to take better care of the ball. Those very fair and level headed  criticisms dont make me a fake fan. Fuck Ive been a fan since the team came to the state of Tennessee. Can everyone just stop being such titty babies?

10023091,0,t1_db0q7ue,I was hoping to work for a conservation nonprofit but those types of jobs are pretty hard to come by. I interned at a couple local organizations and I really enjoyed it but cash is tight and the attorneys on staff are already underpaid. Some of the bigger organizations like WildEarth Guardians Sierra Club Defenders of Wildlife and Center for Biological Diversity have attorney positions opening up relatively frequently so long as youre willing to move around the country. Since all my family is in Idaho and I knew I wanted to practice in Oregon my search radius was extremely limited.I did not consider joining a general practice firm during law school. But once loan companies come calling and youve been unemployed for six months you have to take what comes along. Eventually Id like to start practicing environmental law. I figure Ill get some experience litigating and doing all that other lawyer stuff at this firm. One of my professors is a big proponent of the concept of private practice public interest attorneys as he calls it. The idea is that youre an attorney who practices something other than environmental law say criminal defense which allows you to earn a living so that you can litigate on behalf of nonprofits pro bono. As an associate with zero experience at my firm Ill be making almost twice what my boss made at the nonprofit. Luckily this firm is socially conscious and I dont feel like Ive sold my soul to make a quick buck. Just remember most lawyers dont stay at one job for their whole career. Furthermore youre not only limited to the area on which you concentrate in school. Law school teaches you how to learn the law. The law is constantly evolving.Sorry it took me so long to respond.

I know he played well this past year with an atrocious cast around him but I still dont know if its enough to bring him back.I keep seeing a lot of people say Robinson and Mularkey wont ever pick up or draft low character guys.  Its not what they do.  Im not sure we have the evidence to prove that yet.  Theyve essentially been with the team one season now Mularkey a little longer.  If were truly going the Patriots way we may build up a solid team and then start taking risk guys and filling in with them.

10770578,0,t1_ddqvioh,Alright interesting points. But here would be my retortsgt product of Murray Mariotas mobility and Grimms blocking schemesIll give you Grimms schemes because we often set up with an extra lineman or TEs blocking in pass pro and it lead to two WR sets which werent effective. But Murrays ability likely isnt going anywhere and Mariotas mobility isnt either. If they can hide the deficiencies in your line why fix them? Why not spend the moneypicks somewhere where our deficiencies arent hidden?gt Notice how much our offense declined at the end of the season when Murray was finally tired? He is making our oline look better than they areI honestly think it was because Murray injured his toe and lost confidence as the season wore on. He wasnt hitting holes at the end of the season like he did at the beginning. I dont think thats evidence that he was making the line look better I think the obvious is the reality he wasnt at . Still had a great year still a great player but the biggest evidence that it was a Demarco problem to me was how well Henry played in his stead at the end of the year. He was on fire and the likelihood of that being the case for  separate backs is unlikely. Fact of the matter if you dont hit  yds on the ground with being a great back and having a good line.gt how is there more equity in the first for a WR over oline with where we currently stand? A lot in my mind. Our receivers werent getting it done this year. They didnt give Marcus enough to throw to. They couldnt get quick separation. On a slant the OL should have little responsibility. Marcus couldnt get the ball out though because no one could get open. Our receivers are triers but theyre not doers right now. We need an impact player at receiver.gt bc there just isnt a Julio in this draftEven in Julios draft they werent sure there was a Julio. He had concerns of not enough production and lack of focus on his drops. Green had concerns about his speed. So very rarely do you get a nearly perfect prospect like Calvin Johnson. They just dont come around. That doesnt mean you dont spend a th or th on them. Not in my eyes anyway.I definitely hear what youre saying and I think theres some merit to it. I think interior OL could be helpful but I dont think the top of the draft is the place to get it. Id save that for the players that well likely never get in FA WRs CBs OTs QBs etc. We can find a really good guard in the midrounds or as I mentioned we can get a promising guy out of the FA. I think that would enable us to have our cake and it too. Also itd be very hard to keep up  m contracts on just the OL. We wouldnt have much money for any other positions!,Tennesseetitans,ddqwlyj,2,t5_2s5fm

11117084,0,t1_des3vbu,And what position would he have played in this offense? X Y Z? How would they use him. There is a difference between being a burner and being able to create on your own. You are correct he does some things that others dont. He is not big enough to be a true X in this offense so at best he would be the Z to play on the opposite side and be the motion man. In all likelihood he would be the Y and be the guy who predominantly runs deep crosses and seam routes. He is not a shifty guy that does a ton once the ball is in his hands  he can out run people but bubbles and such are as much a part of his game as most slot guys. There is a BIG difference between playing in a spread offense that NO runs and the one the Titans run. If he were to play the X in this offense  AKA THE NUMBER  RECEIVER WHO HE DIDNT EVEN PLAY BECAUSE MICHAEL THOMAS IS MUCH BETTER SUITED FOR  he would tend to get mauled facing press coverage with a safety over the top because this offense runs so few receivers out in the routes early.

Right now we have two real offensive weapons Murray and Walker. If Mariota had more options we can mix up what we do and keep defenses on their toes. I think we need a real WR.

At least not a high percentage. I would actually feel more comfortable with evan engram and turning him into that type of player.,Tennesseetitans,dga52kw,2,t5_2s5fm
11605476,0,t3_65mdwc,If were talking about current Titans Delanie by far. It was truly amazing watching film on our offense last year. The defense was playing Wheres Delanie on every single play and still couldnt stop him.  All Mariota had to do was stare his way for an extra half second and  guys were going the wrong direction. On top of his receiving presence it always amazes me that people completely forget that hes one of the best blocking TEs in the league. Delanie is our best short intermediate and deep threat sadly on top of being our best blocker at TE and a damn good community man. The only disappointment that ever comes to mind with Delanie is that we didnt get him earlier in his career. Ive been watching this team since the first day in Nashville and I made a bit of a controversial statement last year that I stand by more than ever.  Delanie Walker is the best tightend to wear Titans blue. Its right between Wycheck and him but I lean Delanie. One more solid season will completely solidify it in my mind.Delanie is right there with McNair Mason Bulluck George etc. as my favorite Titans of all time.,Tennesseetitans,dgbhnx1,34,t5_2s5fm

11627829,0,t3_65whfs,IMO none of these WRs are worth anywhere near a top  pick. If you go back and look at the WRs thats get drafted in the top  the last few years these guys cant compete. Just because your the best WR in a crappy class doesnt justify overdrafting a player. A left tackle isnt going top  this year just because hes the best of a bad group. To me its the same thing for the WRs. I dont like any of these WRs even close to the top  let alone . Maybe at  if Im an NFL GM with all the info. But based on tape and measurables Im staying away from a first round WR. Which sucks for us because it is by far our biggest need. JRob knows that hence the almost cooks trade but that says to me he doesnt like the WRs this year as much as we think. As far a Davis specifically hes an early nd talent to me at best. With no measurables and playing lower competition I wouldnt risk a top pick especially with the talent available in this draft. OJNjokuWilliamsEngramDavis That would probably be my list for top  pass catchers. With a pretty big gap between OJ and the rest. When all is said and done Id rather have  TEs and  corners from elite classes than JAG WRs for the sake of getting them. ,Tennesseetitans,dge0z5t,2,t5_2s5fm

11805629,0,t3_68gc1m,gtThe Tennessee Titans are the epitome of a team that has rebuilt right. They got their franchise quarterback they built up the offensive line in order to protect said quarterback they brought in talented backs to take pressure off said quarterback and now theyre giving him his weapons. gtMarcus Mariota had to be thrilled to see the Titans spend two of their top three picks on receivers Corey Davis and Taywan Taylor both of whom have the ability to become stars. Davis who had three yard seasons in the MAC should be ready to contribute right away. Taylor also had a monster career in a lesshyped conference CUSA and he has the speed to change games immediately. gtWith those two working with Mariota and fellow wideouts Rishard Matthews and Tajae Sharpe complemented by stud offensive linemen Jack Conklin and Taylor Lewan and backs DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry that offense should explode in . gtBut what about the defense? They took care of that side of the ball in free agency giving the secondary an injection of talent by adding cornerback Logan Ryan and safety Johnathan Cyprien without losing anybody important. And they used their other firstround pick on versatile USC corner Adoree Jackson. gtIt is hard to find a weak spot now. The Titans are the Jaguars plus a great young quarterback. They increased their win total from three in  to nine in  and are poised to keep climbing in .This also puts us at the top of the AFCS in their rankings.,Tennesseetitans,dgy7j0z,38,t5_2s5fm
