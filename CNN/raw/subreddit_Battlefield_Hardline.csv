1195603,0,t3_27t4xn,Actually I have seen something epic. It was something simple and small but it is these types of details and random occurrences that make the game.I was watching my wife play and she was on top of the bridge above where the objective starts. A cop car came speeding around a corner and headed straight at her. No chance she would survive.Suddenly a RPG slammed into it from the side. The destroyed car actually bounced and did several fast  spins before landing right in front of her. It looked awesome.What other game series gives you that type of destruction and experience?,Battlefield_Hardline,ci44gu6,6,t5_31y1l
