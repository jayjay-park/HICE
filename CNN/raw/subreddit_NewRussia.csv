2419960,0,t3_2n6k3c,What can we Americans do to stop this genocide?Nothing.And that right there is proof that our vaunted Freedom and Democracy is a lie.Our regime spent  on the promotion of Freedom and Democracy in Ukraine.  The money would have been better spent on a quest for real freedom and democracy here in the U.S..A year ago Ukraine was at peace.  But then the  billion began to bear poisonous fruit  in the form of the Maidan Riots.  Predictably the continuous riot was infiltrated by neoNazis.  Efforts to contain the monthslong riot were blocked by the U.S..  As in other regimechange operations police and demonstrators were shot and killed by unidentified snipers.  The elected government was then framed and swept aside by a wave of outrage.  That is how Ukraines nightmare began.  The currency is now in freefall.  Ukraines main trading partner and patron has been stabbed in the back.  The countrys gold has been handed over to the U.S..  And the country is now ruled by a corrupt oligarch who wastes the countrys few remaining resources on a genocidal war against what was once Ukraines main industrial region.  This genocide is being used to draw Russia in to the conflict so that the U.S. can then have a pretext for making war on Russia.Millions of people are suffering!   the people of east Ukraine who are being bombed and shelled and starved the refugees who have fled to Russia who have lost their homes the people of the remainder of Ukraine who are now bankrupt the Russians who are being demonized  the Americans who are the cannonfodder and cashcows for the war racketIf we Americans were truly free would we support this suicidal misanthropic war racket?  Where is our humanity?!  Where is our sanity?Clearly we are not free.  Divideandconquer elections are used to keep us bound to a mad inhuman system.  The chattering Establishment media are used to deflect our attention from the catastrophic consequences of our regimes policies.And when we do finally become aware of what is going on we are denounced as Conspiracy Theorists and marginalized and discredited and silenced.  Yes we are free to express ourselves  but nothing comes of that expression because we the people are out of the loop cut out of the political process.  The sort of freedom we have is the sort of freedom an inmate in a maximum security prison has He too is free to express himself by banging on the bars or scrawling on the wall.  The Prison Authorities are murdering our fellow inmates and all of our banging on the bars does nothing to stop them.,NewRussia,cmatdtu,0,t5_34nnq

Justin Raimondo Kievs Bloody War Is Backfiring  And the War Party is pushing to prop up their Ukrainian sock puppets Antiwar.com  Feb Can one possibly find a more graphic illustration of my claim that fascism is the ideology of national suicide?!  The U.S.backed regime is conscripting men from age  to  and now considers conscripting women For what?  To wage a genocidal war against what used to be the countrys most productive industrial region  this in a country with an economy in collapse.  So the regime in Kiev is feeding the Ukrainian people to the meatgrinder to please John McCain Hillary Clinton and the bankers at the I.M.F..gt When Ukrainian army officers came to the Ukrainian village of Velikaya Znamenka to tell the men to prepare to be drafted they werent prepared for what happened next. As the commanding officer was speaking a woman seized the microphone and proceeded to tell him off Were sick of this war! Our husbands and sons arent going anywhere! She then launched into a passionate speech denouncing the war and the coup leaders in Kiev to the cheers of the crowd.gt What she did is now a crime in Ukraine the only reason she wasnt arrested on the spot is that the villagers wouldnt have permitted it. But in Ukrainian Transcarpathia wellknown journalist for Ukrainian Channel  Ruslan Kotsaba has been arrested and charged with treason and espionage for making a video in which he declared I would rather sit in jail for three to five years than go to the east to kill my Ukrainian brothers. This fearmongering must be stopped. Kotsaba may sit in jail for twentythree years the prescribed term for the charges filed against him. gt Kotsabas arrest is part of a desperate effort by the Ukrainian government to intimidate the growing antiwar and antidraft movement which threatens to upend Kievs dreams of conquering the rebellious eastern provinces. Kotsabas particular crime according to prosecutors was in describing the conflict as a civil war rather than a Russian invasion. This is a point the authorities cannot tolerate the same meme being relentlessly broadcast by the Western media  that an indigenous rebellion with substantial support is really a Russian plot to subvert Ukraine and reestablish the Warsaw Pact  now has the force of law in Ukraine. Anyone who contradicts it is subject to arrest.gt gt Also subject to arrest and worse the thousands who are fleeing the country in order to avoid being conscripted into the military. In a Facebook post that was quickly deleted Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak wrote According to unofficial sources hostels and motels in border regions of neighboring Romania are completely filled with draft dodgers. President Petro Poroshenko the Chocolate Oligarch is readying a decree imposing possible restrictions on foreign travel for those of draft age  which means anyone from age  to . Ukrainians may soon be prisoners in their own country  but they arent taking it lying down. gt Draft resistance is at an alltime high a mere  percent of those called up have reported voluntarily. This has forced the Kiev authorities to go knocking on doors  where they are met either with a mass of angry villagers who refuse to let them take anyone or else ghost towns where virtually everyone has fled. In the Transcarpathia region of western Ukraine entire villages have been emptied the inhabitants fleeing to Russia to wait out the war  or the fall of the Kiev regime whichever comes first. It may seem a paradox says Transcarpathias chief recruitment officer but from the western Ukrainian region of Ternopyl people have fled to Russia in order to escape army conscription. The frantic Ukrainian regime is now contemplating conscripting women over .gt gt Poroshenkos military mobilization is due not only to numerous setbacks in the east  Ukrainian troops are being pushed back on all fronts by highly motivated rebels defending their own towns and villages  but also because thousands are deserting throwing down their arms and fleeing to Russia. In response the Ukrainian parliament has passed a law authorizing local commanders to shoot deserters on the spot. gt gt With Poroshenkos war looking like a major disaster one that could easily topple his EUUSinstalled regime the War Party in the US is turning up the heat demanding that Washington provide Kiev with arms. Sen. John McCain is  naturally  leading the charge but prominent liberals are also in the front ranks with leading scholars of the Brookings Institution recently calling for heavy weapons to be sent. That provoked a response from a dissident within Brookings former State Department official Jeremy Shapiro who argues that the Ukrainian conflict is a civil war that cannot have a military solution and is more than likely to provoke a dangerous military confrontation with Russia.gt The Obama administration is under considerable pressure from within the Presidents own party to start arming the Ukrainian army but Americas European allies are reluctant to let this war go on much longer especially now that their sock puppet Poroshenko is increasingly unpopular. With protests erupting all over western Ukraine Germanys Angela Merkel is openly opposing escalation of the war. She made that clear at a recent conference in Munich where Merkel spoke after returning from talks with Russias Vladimir Putin and French President Francois Hollande. Meanwhile on the sidelines McCain was telling reporters If we had provided Ukraine with weapons they wouldnt have had to use cluster bombs.gt They dont call him Mad John for nothing.gt The United States is providing the Kiev regime with military training and we already have American boots on the ground there ostensibly to strengthen the rule of law. What that means in practice is that we are bolstering a government that has declared war on its own people and is rapidly closing off all legal means of dissent  charging political opponents with treason banning political parties and unleashing ultranationalist mobs on anyone who dares dissent. While the US State Department regularly canoodles with Russian dissidents who defile Orthodox churches and bare their breasts for the Western cameras you wont hear Marie Harf so much as mention Ruslan Kotsabas name.

3399495,0,t1_cpfkptn,Thank you for your frank and helpful comment rim.  Fear can be very harmful  when it leads to panic and paralysis or extreme tension.  At other times fear can be helpful It can protect us from danger.  It prompts us to flee from a burning building or get out of the way of an oncoming car or it can motivate us to find courage and fight back.Fear is an loud alarm.  If we respond to the alarm and take intelligent action the alarm subsides.  If we do nothing or fail to respond in an effective way then the alarm gets louder and becomes unbearable.  Fear turns into panic and hysteria.I have been campaigning against the War Party for  years  that is the form my response to fear takes.  I am very concerned about the U.S. but I am not panicked.  I believe that I am doing my part to avert catastrophe.Does your fear take the form of concern or panic?  Panic in most cases is not helpful.What can we do?  that is the question.  How can we resist the suicidal war addiction?  As the crisis becomes more intense opportunities for communication develop.  You have often seen me quote the German general Rundstedt.  War opened his eyesRundstedt put it bluntly to Allied interrogators after the war I realized he said soon after the attack was begun that everything that had been written about Russia was nonsense.  William L. Shirer The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich p. I am active in the Disqus forum  I see many Russians participating there responding to antiRussia articles.  Not all of these people speak English well but at least their presence provides Americans with a glimpse of reality.  We need more Russians!The malevolence in the world today is no worse than it was ten or twenty years ago.  But in the past it was buried hidden now it is out in the open where we can use all of our human faculties to confront it and fight it.  The need to combat evil in the world forces us to face ourselves and get to know ourselves.  We become larger braver more open to others.In WW II the Soviet Union won.  Can the antifascists win again?  If we do it will be the final victory over fascism  the final war.  But winning is not everything.  We resist not because we hope to win we resist because we love to do what is right!  Be guided by love every hour of every day. Love is our best weapon in this struggle. ,NewRussia,cpfro7b,0,t5_34nnq

3679226,0,t3_32h2at,Reply part Now that I have read the entire essay I judge it to be confusing and less than helpful.  The author simply replaces one intellectual belief system with another.  Where the behaviorist believes in chemicals the author believes in nous whatever that may be.  Belief is at war with reason thus it is a source of the very fragmentation that the author decries.  Belief cannot be a cure for fragmentation!  unless reason is destroyed utterly and the individual becomes a slave to arbitrary beliefs.  Such mindless zombies believing whatever they are told are already in great abundance  we do not need more!The problem is not a particular belief The problem is belief itself.My religion is experiential.  I experience God everywhere  in Beauty in Justice in Dignity in Love in Clarity in Simplicity.  Experience is a roaring waterfall belief is a tin horn.  I am astonished by the wrongheadedness of the theologians Oblivious to the roar that is all around them they obsess over a few toots.Above all I experience God in the body through proprioception.  That is where I find my unity  in touch in feeling.  Touch is the bridge between the finite and the infinite One moment we reach for the cup of coffee and the next moment we are reaching for the stars.As we come to know ourselves we discover our mortality.  We are dying even as we live.  We learn that we are not permanently attached to this material universe.  What are we attached to then?  We find within ourselves both a desire to live and a desire to die.  At times we want to engage the world and at times we want to be free of this world.  The balance between these two desires is what the neoPlatonists called soul.  It is both mortal and immortal.   ,NewRussia,cqbnmkf,2,t5_34nnq
