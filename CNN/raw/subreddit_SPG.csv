401215,0,t3_1yojgp,Ive been a trend setter for most of my life. You can let it irk you or you can enjoy that this awesome band is becoming more successful every day due to supporters like you! Personally I gave up being irked because I just dont feel like its worth my energy.,SPG,cfmco73,3,t5_2uf7y

5110015,0,t1_cv1k6lt,You know how theres british humour and then theres american humour? SPGs just drifted a bit far to the american side. Particularly in Rabbits characterisation. Im not saying Im going to stop being a fan for this or anything but I wish theyd reign it in a bit.That said yknow this video at the core is still something Rabbit would do. Its just the OTT enthusiasm makes it not funny. Rabbits charm was always the way she would just do something ridiculous like it was a totally normal thing.,SPG,cv1y5ns,5,t5_2uf7y
