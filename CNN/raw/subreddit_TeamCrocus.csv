7228386,0,t1_d1zop8v,You can only do what you can do.  It sucks to break the streak.  I lost mine after week four because I strained my calf playing with one of my boys after my wife had told him to go to bed.  It put be about a week behind and Im still pissed about it!  But Id rather be mad and running than mad and not...,TeamCrocus,d1ztaqm,3,t5_3dutl

7368495,0,t3_4g70bw,Since the Bk program is a  week process Im going to repeat week . Run  mins walk  min Repeat x. Downloaded the RunKeeper app but open to other suggestions because I have found I dont keep a consistent pace at all. Taking this time to improve my running as part of my running challenge. Progress is slow and that is frustrating but I still feel awesome getting outside and running my mph speed aka  minute mile. I can do . minute mile if I really push myself. Real numbers and stats it makes me feel more like a runner and not a pretender.edit I credit a lot of my success of Ck because I did take it slow. Building the endurance had to come first. Only now am I trying to adjust and add in other goals ,TeamCrocus,d2fqwby,2,t5_3dutl

7401871,0,t1_d2jj8wg,Nice work on the veggies!  Thats something I really stink at.My experience has been do not run through pain it only makes pain worse.  If your ankles are still hurting take a day or two off from running.  In the alternative Ive always walked on days I can run.  Others use elliptical machines or bikes.  And doing some ankle stretches will help out a ton!Really excited what you bring to the table on Friday! Sounds like youve really be going after it!!!,TeamCrocus,d2jjl9d,2,t5_3dutl

7554299,0,t3_4i55cw,Ive been a member of my current gym for  years now. At my old college gym I knew the weight area so would do a bit of a circuit but by the time I moved gyms I got so intimated with the new machines and feeling so self conscious that Ive never touched one in the two years. Today I did a weight machine I was familiar with! I didnt do a whole circuit and I want to go back later at night one day and really get a grasp of the area but I was really proud of going over to that section and still getting my cardio in. ,TeamCrocus,d30vywf,3,t5_3dutl

7906927,0,t3_4nl1wm,umakethetime suggested I share my weightloss charm bracelet. I wear this every day and it is definitely a big motivator to keep doing well. I love jewelry so when this idea popped up on rloseit I knew it would be perfect for me.I dont have the beads in order but most of them are Trollbeads brand like the silver bracelet and clasp featured in second picture. I also added the globular purple magnetic clasp so I have two clasps Im crazy like that. Two beads are a pair I count as representing my husband amp I because he has been so supportive of me calling you out again uTheNamelessOne youre awesome! There is one small spacer bead too. Lastly in the th picture there are some findings the loops altogether I put those on to represent the pounds lost twice with my few minor backtracks.I should probably put it up in photoshop and make an image explaining each one but Im still at work.,TeamCrocus,d44tauc,4,t5_3dutl
