4779715,0,t3_3gd6p8,I always have trouble against Spacies and any very quick character like Squirtle or Lucas.Bombs and UpB OoS work well to relieve the pressure but not usually enough to pull off any missile cancelling or SWDing.I am learning Ike and Squirtle on the side just because I enjoy their playstyles.,SamusMains,ctx0ve0,2,t5_392k6
4794108,0,t3_3gjd1w,Mind games.  I love to get a fully charged shot and then sit on it for half the game.  A lot of the reflects in the game have good end lag so you can punish them for using it.  Punish them enough times and they will stop so you can sneak one in.  Other than that save it for roll and air dodge punishes.  Oh and dont forget zair poke.  Cant be reflected and has really nice range.,SamusMains,ctyu4f9,5,t5_392k6
5272755,0,t1_cvllf9t,I highly doubt the better frame data stuff especially compared to Falcons. Have you even seen the two dashatks compared?Anyway Ive yet to try her but from what Ive seen the changes are very very good but nothing major.Are you sure the sudden spike in popularity isnt just to test her out? And if not what has gotten really better for her? Because I only saw some better linking in the screwattack a few frames on the nair and some minor buff at the fair and this is definitely not enough to make her viable sadly.,SamusMains,cvlnjuf,1,t5_392k6
