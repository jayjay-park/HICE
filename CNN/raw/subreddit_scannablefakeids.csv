9324366,0,t3_5825d0,I dont know how snapcard works but with BCT wallets if youre new it sometimes takes up to a week to transfer to your BCT wallet so that it can be used. Check your account on fakeid.chat and if it says confirmed in green then youre good. If it doesnt then your order will be thrown out and you can re order when your USD money become BCT money,scannablefakeids,d8xxkhq,1,t5_3ac45
