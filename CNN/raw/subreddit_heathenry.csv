11176145,0,t3_5zkl50,My tldud too long dont understand dutchThere are about  Holy oaks remaining in the netherlands. Worshipping oaks used to be common before christianity. During the early years of christianisation worshipping trees was condemned by the church. Later the folkpractice was integrated into christianity. Theres a legend about the mariaidol in the tree. A farmer found the idol in the tree and took it home. The next day the figure was gone. When he came past the tree again the figure was at the same place where had found it again and the bottom of its cloak was covered in mud. The figure is said to have walked back over night. This repeated it self another two times until the farmer thought that maria wanted to be worshipped there in that tree. So they built a chapel around it.,heathenry,deysxpm,3,t5_2rb5n
