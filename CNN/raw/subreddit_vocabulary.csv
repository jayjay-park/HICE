I cant really tell.I first thought of this question gt I wondered about thisputting a lot of words ... at my disposal gt having a lot of words ... at my disposalAs the previous commenter noted your vocabulary and writing is fine. But you didnt need to mention that you were a nonnative speaker  that part was fairly obvious. Frankly though your writing is better than most native speakers. The sentence structure just gave it away.,vocabulary,cuhvjbo,3,t5_2qk8h
4947576,0,t1_cuh9q9v,Yes its mostly just that some of your phrasings and word choices seem overly formal  as you say textbookish. Its easy to understand what youre saying though  often easier than native speakers who write poorly.Adding to what uZharol saidIs it that nowadays... gt These days do...How I wish...  This is correct but usually only used in a poeticexaggerated context. Wed normally just say I wish......me who often finds... gt ...me. I often find...when I am reading ... I feel like Im getting drowned...  when I read ... I feel like Im drowning,vocabulary,cui6kj2,3,t5_2qk8h
