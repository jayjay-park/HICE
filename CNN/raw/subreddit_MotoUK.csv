584599,0,t1_cg6lnde,CGs are absolutely bombproof. Easy to ride and they take a ridiculous amount of abuse. Any example with a decent service history and full MOT will almost certainly do you fine. Check the service history for training schools though  ex CBT bikes will have been dropped a lot and used by people who have no idea what a clutch is. On the other hand it will have spent is life plodding along at the speed limit and probably been well serviced but Id personally take a critical approach to such a bike. I took a gamble buying private on all my bikes except my last one but then they both only cost  and I wasnt reliant on it for transport so the price made it worth the risk. If youre looking at using it as your only way of getting around a dealers warranty is a sound precaution to take. Im not local to London so wouldnt have a clue about your local dealers though.Edit just noticed your concerns about reliability when buying older. Id take a  year old Honda over a  year old Jinlun or other Chinese bike any day. Usually you can tell when an older bikes been well looked after just by appearance  lack of rust on the downpipes is an obvious one. Older bikes are also far simpler so if you have any interest in doing your own maintenance theyre a great place to start. ,MotoUK,cg6q1m9,2,t5_2wf1v

Remove filler plug These have a habit of being in stupid places on chinese s make sure you know where it is. Remove sump plug allow oil to completely drain into oil pan. Remove oil filter. Clean oil filter mating surface. Smear oil round new filter gasket and put it on the bike just hand tight. Replace sump plug. Refill with quality oil graded for your bike up to level on sightglass or dipstick this will be level OR on the sidestand as per in owners manual. Replace filler cap. Run your bike for a bit to circulate. Top up if required.. Replace filler cap.. Check round the filter and sump plug for any weepage if there is any just give it a little more wipe off and run up to temp again to see if its solved it. Check all the big fasteners arent loose or anythingBiggest tip I will give you is if your filter is in a stupid place buy a KampN one  theyve got a nut on the end so theyre easier to get on off and theyre only a few extra quid.Im hoping you check your bike over weekly  tyre pressures and condition etc. but if not you should probably start and obviously checking your lights work before you ride off. If your tail light aint working at night theres a good chance someone could smash into the back of you remember! Not to mention people not seeing you in the day if you dont have lights on half the time.Shouldnt need any other filters or adjustments yet and you should periodically adjust chain tension anyway as per in the owners manual. Every  miles is recommended although I usually check it weekly when I do my weekly winter maintenance inspection.You should change your brake fluid every two years if it hasnt been done as well.

7252805,0,t1_d22koxh,Yeah I think the one plus side of a real GPS over a phone one is that its a bit less likely to go wrong softwarewise since theres no other rogue processes going on on the thing to ruin it. I dont think though that its the norm for mobile phone sat nav to go wrong not least because thats all Ive been using for a couple of years now and I can remember three times that Ive had issues that were down to Android. Oddly most of the other people I ride with frequently who do relatively high miles andor touring tend to use their phone too also apparently without huge issues. What were you using? I tried all the Android ones I could pirate for a few thousand miles each a couple of years ago and while they were all a bit crap in their own ways most of them actually functioned as a satnav more than what you tried appears to have.I found my Rider  so much more infuriating than any phone satnav not least because the maps were corrupt and TomTom wanted money to fix it but I appreciate that thats from just before the point at which TomTom and Garmin finally got their shit together and stopped just waterproofing entrylevel car satnavs. But its really telling that theyre still mostly copying the phone ones and the only compelling reasons to shell out  for a dedicated satnav is that its probably going to crash less than your phone and itll be waterproof though if you ride a motorbike youre fairly likely to have got a waterproof phone anyway. Its a bit annoying that its tricky to test ride them though. Im really tempted by some of the features of the newer ones but Ive been disappointed by both in the past and theres only a couple of usability things that Id like my phone to get right. Also Im not sure I want to have to use two devices to do a job that one does pretty well now...Ive never really found any satnavs do voice instruction in a way that Id like but thats probably mostly because I listen to podcasts and stuff when Im riding along so I dont like to miss bits of conversation for the sake of directions I can get just as easily from the screen on my handlebars.,MotoUK,d22lbnb,1,t5_2wf1v

If so will this match up with the new switchgear?Are the connectors definitely the same? They most likely are but its always worth making sure they might not necessarily be wired up the same way inside as well.I suspect that most of those points wont be an issue and itll probably be a fairly straightforward swap but its something to keep in mind.,MotoUK,d2zrvfp,1,t5_2wf1v

Turning right at a set of traffic lights I thought the opposite lane was still being held at the lights so I turned across the lead car when the lights went green she was slow to get off the line though so there was plenty of space and no danger of being hit.Then I stalled at a different set of lights trying to take off too quickly and let my clutch out a bit too sharply.Live and learn!,MotoUK,d4v3dyt,1,t5_2wf1v

Essentially a CBT is a  day course not a test where the morning is spent learning to control the bike in a safe space followed by a short theory section after lunch and then an on road ride in the afternoon. Provided that the bike school is satisfied you can control the motorcycle safely theyll issue you a CBT certificate which allows you to ride a cc with L plates and you can renew it every  years if you dont want to ride a bigger bike.There is no point in doing the full test until you are at least  because only then can you ride a more powerful bike. You can only ride a full powered bike once you are  by completing a theory test a mod  and mod . If you have done the full test at  you will have to retake both tests at this point in order to get the full licence.Choose a good school for your CBT as it will be beneficial to your learning.,MotoUK,d5fupkq,3,t5_2wf1v

8324594,0,t3_4tjy96,My insurer made me pay more for cancelling my policy in the same circumstances sold  bought big bike was much cheaper to buy new policy than to change existing plus an administrator charge . Reason given was that Id paid for a  month policy but I wasnt using it for the full  months. The adviser said that if I hadnt told them Id sold the bike DVSA would have notified them so they would still have come to me for more money. Try working that out with a logical brain you end your policy early  you havent claimed  and they ask for more money! Presumably taking shorter term insurance means you are a riskier prospect when your details are fed through a computer   but in the real world when youve already sold the bike there is  chance of having an accident! I didnt expect a rebate but to be told to pay more really pssed me off.  It was Devitt badged up as RAC in case anyone else is with them and in the same circumstances. In the end I managed to get them to waive the administration fee because my new policy was also underwritten by Devitt so they classed it as if I hadnt left but I still had to pay extra to them . Needless to say I just renewed with a different company. Though they are no doubt just as crooked!Edit   The letter from Devitt,MotoUK,d5i4nw5,1,t5_2wf1v

Also if you dont do it already point your chin in the direction you want to go forces your head up and pointing the right way Mod   relax you dont have to do any tricky manoeuvres. Treat the examiner as a sat nav. They dont expect you to be an amazing rider  just competent and not a danger to yourself or other road users. Also you arent being tested on your navigation skills  if you approach a roundabout and realise you missed their directions then choose a direction and boldly take it. Boldly going in the wrong direction is better than hesitantly picking your way round hoping youll get a prompt or worse changing your mind and doing something stupid.Also try to make it obvious that you are carrying out your regular observations e.g. pull your elbow in when checking a mirror.Good luck and have fun,MotoUK,d7y3i60,7,t5_2wf1v

9503169,0,t3_5avx6j,ACF is quite viscous but the ideal way to apply it is in as fine a mist as possible which is very difficult with the spray can and can be quite tricky even with the bottlemister combination. I found that its very easy to overapply the stuff and you end up with drips of it all over the bike on the easy to reach surfaces but not much in the harder to reach places which I guess is where you really want it as a quick post ride rinse with a hose wouldnt really clean these areas of salt residue easily. The chaps who apply the stuff professionally use a compressor and a spray gun to get a good even coverage whereas using the aerosol can youre essentially just blasting a stream of it onto the bike and hoping it runs into the areas where you want it. I have found that heating the bottle or can up helps a lot with keeping the spray as fine as possible but even then youll still end up having to wipe a lot of excess away from your bike afterwards. If I only had the aerosol to hand Id probably try to get a plant mister type spray from somewhere spray the aerosol into the reservoir heat it and apply it that way. However you do need to be careful which mister you use as when Ive tried to use the liquid in a plant mister previous it seemed too thick for the mister to cope with so you might need to use a wellrinsed spray bottle which previously held some other relatively thick liquid. Ive not heard anything about paintwork damage and actually have found it works brilliantly as a general polish on black plastics as it really brings back a dark shine to them. I actually now keep a cloth soaked in ACF sealed in a plastic bag which I use to give the visible surfaces a quick wipe over to shine things up occasionally. In terms of removing plastics the ideal would be to remove as much big stuff as possible as this should ensure that you get properly to the areas they cover. Removing things like the seat helps as it means that you dont end up sliding all over the place on the first ride and that you also get a coating in from the top down in any areas directly under the seat.As everybody else says avoid the brakes and tyres wherever possible but Id also try to avoid getting too much on the exhaustheader pipes if you can unless you want to look like youre laying down a Whacky Races style smokescreen when you ride off for the first time. Id also avoid getting it on the mirror glass too as it can be a bit of a pain to clean it off without getting smeary streaks all over them.,MotoUK,d9kgv4a,1,t5_2wf1v

Thats a lot of servicing  particularly on an older bike and a massive hit of depreciation on a newer one  dealer servicing to keep the warranties etc.My advice would be to spend k on something like a good condition FZ Hornet Bandit etc that has a bullet proof engine and will just run and run given regular oil changes and maintenance barring anything major.I had an  FZ which whilst I didnt do that kind of annual mileage on it I commuted every day toured and even took it on track and it never missed a beat nothing other than tyres brake pads and disks fluids and filters. Valves stayed in spec for the  miles I had it.If youre at all mechanically minded learn to service it yourself.

Riding with a chain in a backpack is a very bad idea so youll also need some way of transporting it on the bike rather than your person. That goes for the disc lock as well actually.

I found it very difficult to focus properly when music was playing and things crept up on me which Id usually have spotted far before they became a factor  so it spooked me a bit and I havent tried it since.

10701549,0,t3_5t28of,Here are my thoughts after regretfully trying to read this . This is largely incomprehensible. . Any trend can be matched to a formula given enough degrees of freedom. Youre making up numbers of depreciation percentage and then further making up numbers of estimated lifetime mileage.Your first premise is that bikes do not follow the simplest rule of depreciation a power law effectively. There is a simple test for this. Gather data and plot     logdC vs. logdt where     dt  interval of time elapse between purchase and current ad price    dC  difference between original price and current priceDo this for a set of data. If the trend follows a simple power law    dC  Cadtthen on the logarithmic plot it will show a straight line. The gradient of this line will be loga i.e. the depreciation value.Whats possible is that the trend is generally powerlawlike but only for the first few years. After that it may shift at which point you may need to account for other factors.But yeah start simple verify the conjecture and then build up. ,MotoUK,ddjsa4v,8,t5_2wf1v

10751848,0,t3_5tspr6,gt but just wondering if there would be much difference between the cruiser and sport type postion when having a passanger?Big difference between my CBR and FZ for my usual pillion. In addition to the angle she also notes that its much easier with the topbox on my FZ as she leans back on it. Use cycleergo to see what the ergonomics are like there is a passenger option. The most useful thing I will say is that my pillion finds it much much easier when Im wearing a backpackrucksack to the extent that well always use a backpack now even if theres nothing to carry. This gives her something to hold on to she holds on to the top of the straps and also provides a bit of a pillow in front. Once we started with the backpack there was never more any clunking of helmets. It ends up being basically as comfortable as it can be as shes sandwiched between the backpack in front and the topbox behind.Finally the backpack shields her hands from the rain and cold.

11123466,0,t1_derzol5,gtgtWell the SV is known to have piece of shit front forks.That is true about the first generation SV when a Kayaba fork with short weak springs was fitted.The preload spacers were five or six inches long.However Suzuki changed to a Showa fork for the second generation SV and longer dual rate springs were installed. The preload spacers were less than  inches long.I own a  SVSF and I spent weeks working with the fork and the springs to find out the truth of what is being said about SV springs.The longer SVS springs are . inches long.The closer wound section of the SVS spring has about  lbsin. rate and the wider wound section has a rate of about  lbsin.This makes for an overall static rate of about  lbsin but the effective rate is constantly changing as the forks stroke up and down over bumps.As more downforce is added to the fork the close wound section acts more and more like a long preload spacer.I wanted to find out just how far I could pull the forks up through the triple clamps to lower the front end and speed up the handling.I have the forks pulled up mm now and the preload adjusters are turned almost fully in.I weigh  pounds with all my gear and I cannot make the fork bottom out.,MotoUK,desu3es,1,t5_2wf1v

11231393,0,t1_df516gx,Uncomfortable horrible suspension nasty synthetic throttle action and not practical enough for me.Bought it new last year and did about K on it and it was ok. Put it away for the winter and rode my winter hack of a old MT for the past  months. Got the XSR out the garage last weekend and went for a spin after a week of commuting on it its back in the garage and Ive dug the MT out again. I just dont want to ride it. It doesnt give me the buzz that my FZ did or my MT does. The rear shock is appalling it spits me out of the seat when hitting anything bigger than a fag packet in the road drop the rear preload and it squats down under acceleration like a pregnant hooker about to drop the sprog and wont come back up. If i have to go distance for work about  miles i have to stop for gas on the way cant do it on a single tank which is fine cos my arse hurts well before  miles. Tried two different seats and neither have made it comfortable enough to do a full tank in one go without crippling myself. Its a brand new bike Ive spent  quid trying to make it comfortable and Yamaha advice for the rear shock is buy our ohlins Its just not good enough for me to keep throwing money at it to make it nice better of cutting my loses.I got sold on the looks If i didnt have to ride and was just going to look at it id keep it but id sooner have a Fugly bike i can ride and makes me smile than a pretty one thats a crap ride. How i like my women..EDIT forgot to mention the BALL ACHE dash on the thing. If im travelling i like to know how far Ive got and what time it is. You have to cycle thru like  display options to get from trip to time and its a pain in the arse trying to do it while your hurtling along.

The ERn looks a bit tasty aswell but im not a huge fan of the Kawasaki green.  Wile you are testing you may aswell try something a bit different  The Triumph Scrambler is a nicetoride bike and the matt blue is gorgeous.
