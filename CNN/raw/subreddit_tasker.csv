Keep in mind that location detection from least to most resource intensive as well as least to most accurate is cell ltwifiltGPS. A simple process assuming you need the office profile to activate when you get out of the car and turn off when you get back in the car is to have your car profiles entry task turn off the office profile and have the exit task turn it on. Of course you dont want that on for every time youre using your car. So you can have a profile that checks for a cell tower near your office minimal battery usage can just leave it active unless you want to script it to only turn on in certain conditions using a StategtCell Near profile. When thats true have a StategtWifi Near profile turn on.

2494263,0,t1_cmk334x,Easy Peasy Im guessing that youre new to Tasker. Ill give you a basic run down of what were going to use.Tasks are as they sound. These are the things that call the commands that were going to use.Profiles are certain events times or various situations that you can specify. The idea is that a certain profile event will call a certain task.So to set up first of all we need to create a task to do our workGo ahead and launch Tasker selecting the Tasks tab. Hit the plus button at the bottom to create a new task. Call it something inventive like  Ringtone or whatever you like. From here you just need to add the actionsHit the plus arrow on bottom right and add the  actions in. E.g.  gt Phone gt Silence Ringer. Once the action is added in the customise window opens and you can select your options as Ive listed above. Hit back to go back into the task to add more actions.Next up when this is done we need to create a profile.From Tasker and select the Profiles tab. Hit the plus button at the bottom right to create a new profile. From here you just need to follow my profile instructions above State gt Phone gt Call then the options below that.Once added youll need to call the task we created above. Then thats pretty much it. Job done Ninja edit  clarified a couple of things,tasker,cmk4zik,1,t5_2s0ro
2548816,0,t3_2ovqy4,If Im reading that right I think you have at least  options. Event profiles have the ability to use the cooldown timer andor limit repeats options. Both can be found in the preferences for the profile once created. You could also add a variable that is set the first time it runs and a check for that variable being set. I use all three but picking which one is best in your case will probably be determined by your setup. ,tasker,cmr9n04,2,t5_2s0ro

3246260,0,t1_coyfnjn,Sure that can be done quite easily.I assume you have changed the multipliers in A and A to from  and  to  and  respectively to get todays events rather than tomorrows? That being the case the simplest way to achieve what you want would be to change the line in A fromTo date    to simplyTo TIMES.This will set the first checked time to the current time rather than am today. A minor point about this this will cause all subsequent checks to occur in five minute increments from the current time rather than pure on the five minute values. ie if the current time is  and  seconds that will be the time first checked  and  seconds will be the next then  and  seconds etc etc. If you would prefer pure on the five minute values you will need to set it toTo TIMES  TIMES  The potential irritation here is that if you run it within  minutes of an event having started it will still return that event but hopefully that isnt too much of an issue. It would be possible to have the first check time be now and subsequent check times to onthe times but that would require adding an extra step at some point and I figure its probably not worth the effort. If you really want to have it behave that way and cant figure it out let me know and I might give it a shot ,tasker,coyheep,1,t5_2s0ro

3389125,0,t3_2yvwun,Last night I finally had a go at automating my TV. The TV is not a smart TV so I didnt know what to do but last night I had an idea. The TV has HDMI CEC so I can switch it on by using my peripherals. What I did was emulate screen touches using the shell command to input tap x y. This allowed me to use the Sky app and the Playstation app to switch them on. I used Show Touch Data in the Developer Options in Settings to find the X and Y positions of the buttons I needed to tap. Then wrote  tasks using these values and wait commands to navigate the apps to turn onoff both systems. I then linked these to trigger with Autovoice when I ask Google to turn onoff Playstation or Sky. Literally it is listening for Playstation on or Sky on or off it just has to contain both those words. This allows me to say anything as long as it contains those words. It works and Im pleased with myself. Now I want to work on being able to search for shows in the Sky app and play them on the TV using only my voice or change channels. This sounds like a task for lazy people and it is but Ive made it out of need. I have a  year old that is forever stealing the remote. He switches channels or turns my Playstation on all the time. We have to hide the remotes from him then we cant find them ourselves ha. This way I can switch off the Playstation when he turns it on using my voice while I chase him around trying to get the control pad off him. ,tasker,cpel597,1,t5_2s0ro

3433357,0,t3_2zisah, When I leave my car in addition to undoing all my car only settings Tasker saves my parking location.  When I subsequently press a widget touch my car keys to my phone or say where did I park it enters walking navigation mode and starts directing me back to the car. Similar feature for just dropping a pin wherever I happen to be standing and finding it again later. When Im jogging if I take the wrong turn that will send me scrambling down a cliff my phone tells me Youre on the wrong goddamn block again.  Go east to Oak Street. Every time I went over a certain pothole near my house I used to have to say BaBUMP! myself.  Now the phone says it for me. When I get close enough to home that I know the territory if my destination is home the phone knows to make navigation instructions silent. When someone texts me while Im driving it sends them that Im driving at X MPH and will get back to them when Im done.  Then the next time Im at home it waits ten minutes and then reminds me of all texts and calls I received while out. When a phone call begins a menu appears giving me the option to record the call. When I sit in my car my phone looks up my upcoming calendar events.  If theres just one it immediately begins navigating me to the associated location.  If theres more than one it gives me a menu.  If there are none it gives me the option to go home or to navigate elsewhere which of those is the default selection depends on how close I am to home.  Then if its dark out it reminds me to turn off my headlights.  Then  seconds into the trip it asks whether I want to listen to a podcast music or silence. A widget on my home screen tells me my current weight colorcoded as to whether its above or below my goal weight.  If my weight is below my goal weight for five straight days it congratulates me and moves the goal weight one pound closer to my target goal weight.  If Im too fat it turns the wallpaper red so I cant forget that I need to be in scarcity mode.  If I dont weigh myself on a given day and Im at home and therefore have access to the scale the phone bugs me every hour until I do. The same widget tells me all colorcoded how many hours its been since I last jogged what my jogging speed record is how many hours until my next calendar event and how many hours until close of business on the East Coast.  If I dont weigh myself on a given day and Im at home and therefore have access to the scale the phone bugs me every hour until I do. When the phone gets too hot it starts warning me.  After a certain point it slows the CPU and runs a task killing program. When I tap the phone to one of the three NFC tags on my bedside table it sets a corresponding alarm  minute nap  hours or am and goes into my slumber mode.,tasker,cpjmn2f,10,t5_2s0ro

See if Tasker Flashes the info you shared.

The alpha plugins are often works in progress although some like AutoTools are so fully functioning that interesting theyre still in alpha.Will be checking out AutoSpotify today.ampnbspampnbspChecked out AutoSpotify here are some details At its basic as youd assume it has basic Media Controls In addition to those obvious options here are the more detailed controls And then it has Play Media which based on any Spotify URI which can easily be queried more on that in a minute the media youd like to play track album playlist can be played immediately or added to the playback Queue or even specify a placetimeindex in the track to begin playing. So setup TaskerSpotify to jump to your favorite Van Halen guitar solo in any Van Halen track!  Theres AutoSpotifygtArtists which can query andor act upon certain Artists by simply providing their name or uri and give you options to Follow Get Top Tracks Get Albunms Get Related Artists and more. Spotify Playlist Management using Tasker is now an easy Task. You can specify a playlist by name or URI and add a song to it by Song Name or URI. And lastly but not leastly  is the AutoSpotify gt Search Action The Search can search by type artsist album playlist tracks based on the terms you supply. A powerful feature of this Action is the Filters FieldampnbspAs you can see just a TON of options to do just about anything with Spotify using Tasker. ampnbspampnbspAUTO SPOTIFY UPDATEAfter a great response and feedback  within literally a day the following new features have been added to the AutoSpotify plugin Player State Event for use in a Profile to detect anytime the player changes tracksstartspauses. As well as a new Player State Query Action to return all info about the currently playing track. Player Notification Customization from the Main App AND from a Tasker action. This lets you customize the buttons that appear in the status bar player both for default buttons ANDOR dynamically within an Task. So you can have custom Spotify controls based on any criteria i.e. what trackartistalbum is playing. Example  and Example  Track Details Action Album Details Action New variable names Note If you are upgrading from yesterdays alpha release check your var names as some of them have changed for better clarification.As you can see from those images the sheer amount of data that can be queried for  returned  utilized is almost mind boggling.

5549448,0,t1_cwkra5y,Oh also you CAN use multiple arrays to create list items where everything combines into one list entry. Youve got to use AutoToolsgtArrays.You enter the arrays you want to input at the top and under Merge you specify either a simple joiner or a format template. Thats how I created these DialogsampnbspampnbspampnbspUnder Merge Format in AutoTools Arrays for that second image link I used this code template    ltbgtltbgtltbrgt    ltigtltigtltbrgt    ALBUM ampnbspIt uses HTML formatting of course and the numbers in the curly braces make reference to an element from the first array the second array and so forth. Note it is based i.e. the first array is referenced by  the second by  etc. Take a look at the second image link and youll see how it matches up.ampnbspampnbspampnbspSo for your list to start out simply just put the following into the Input Array field    assearchtrackname|assearchtrackartistnamesampnbspNotice the pipe char  |  separates each array in the input field. If you want them sorted by track name check off the Sort checkbox. It sorts by the first array listed and keeps the sort synchronized across all the arrays you input so everything stays matched Then just check the Merge Checkbox. In the Joiner field just enter a newline character enter key or whatever youd like. If you want to get fancy and use some HTML instead of the Joiner you could use the Format Field and something like    Track ltbgtltbgtltbrgt    Artist ltigtltigtltbrgtampnbspThen you can choose the name for your new single Merged Array. This will be one array containing elements from the input arrays all now combined and formatted. So if you choose a name of  combined   after that Action just put that same array name into the Text input field for the Dialog List.  combined  neat stuff eh ampnbsp,tasker,cwkyl5n,1,t5_2s0ro

6209831,0,t3_40mt8g,So as youre only dealing with a single Profile lets get it working First yes make sure Tasker is enabled. The Tasker icon in the upper left of the Tasker app should be litupcolored and not greyed out. If it is greyed out  long click it to enable Tasker.Then in your Profile add a first Action of something like    A. Alert gt Popup Work Profile Activated  Timeout Slider Never all the way to the right.ampnbspThis will alert you on the screen that the Profile ran the Task and the rest of the Actions should have occured.Lastly some settings like Volumes  Tasker will revert on its own when the Profile becomes inactive for any number of reasons. To fix this long click on your Profiles name in the Profiles Tab. Scroll down the list to Restore Settings and uncheck that box.Between all of those you should have it working ampnbspampnbspAlso if youre new to Tasker it is great to watch all the videos in the Tasker  series on Youtube watch a couple a day in a couple weeks youll be well versed in Tasker.Also if you look to the right in the sidebar of this subreddit gt youll see a whole bunch of Learning Resource Guide links as well for getting started.ampnbsp,tasker,cyvhohm,3,t5_2s0ro

6423194,0,t1_cziachf,Think I may have to solution.Tasker has some image manipulation functions under the Action gt Image category.Before an image can be changedrotatedetc it has to be loaded into Taskers Image Buffer using Load Image. Then you can rotate the image and set it in the Scene using Scene gt Element Image gt Source Image Buffer.So if you build a Scene with an Image Element named  Image     A. Show Scene My Scene     A. Load Image ltpath to imagegt    A. Rotate Image  degrees ltforward or backgt    A.

The thing that interested me is that Tasker has all of this functionality but its difficult to access. What Andreesen helped bring about was a tool that made it easier for anyone to make a website that others could easily used. Then a community formed around them.   The book Im reading says that BernersLee who invented the hyperlinked web initially wanted to restrict it to academic types to prevent it from becoming a mess. He was happy it was difficult to use. But then Andreessen comes along and makes it easy to navigate all the sudden it explodes. In  there were  websites. Then comes MOSAIC and by  there were  sites. The analogy the book uses is that BernersLee made the roads but it Andreesen making the car before it took off.

Probably because its always running on the background or so???The five minute loop is indeed a last resort but Im hoping to avoid that.I dont think intents are gonna help me out here as I havent been able to find an intent that suits my needs but if people know one Id like to hear it. Furthermore Ive read something about a file changed on the sqlite db of clock or something? But I cant find the db and I think Ill probably need root for that? ,tasker,d39ww4g,1,t5_2s0ro
7709872,0,t3_4ktwpk,Do you have wifi at home? Or work? If so then this is for you...Once you leave your homework wifi have it enable bluetooth. Once you reconnect to your homework wifi have it disable bluetooth.There will be a short lag for the wifi to disconnect if your radios are putting out a decent power so you you may not connect to your car until your a bit away from home.This will eliminate all need for nfc tags of course you could enable nfc when you leave a trusted wifi and disable it when you reconnect.Ive been using this for years now with zero probs. YMMV.,tasker,d3ik7bm,2,t5_2s0ro

Like you mentioned this will be helpful to a developer including Pent whos working to get Tasker ready for Android N as much as everyone else is.Hopefully though you can find a wordaround until Android N and Tasker update to full release.,tasker,d3o57k9,1,t5_2s0ro

7917919,0,t1_d460px1,Okay so just tested it with the same version of Maps and it seems to work fine just as you have it your original post.Try this instead of specifying Maps or any application leave all the Apps unchecked and go under the field for Any where it says where any text will match and type in  EXIT Since the button is labelled EXIT NAVIGATION it should return the correct info about the notification  and your original A should work.,tasker,d461rvz,1,t5_2s0ro

People usually forget to report when it works and only report when it doesnt Yes natural language is the only way to offer dynamic responses for now.To get audio clip responses you basically have to create a response with a text like this one     ltspeakgtltaudio src DokilyltaudiogtltspeakgtJust make sure that the url is a publicly accessible mp file smaller than  megs Let me know how it works!,tasker,dd3w6gq,1,t5_2s0ro

10999832,0,t3_5x2pwq,Also very curious if anyone has found something.A simple way to do this would be to just track your sugar intake daily during each meal. That is assuming you know how many grams of sugar youre eating every time. All you need is a tracking app that notifies you to when you reach a certain threshold. Then you can go into habitica to do what you need to do.I just posted about a Daily Water Consumption Tracker Tasker Project a few days ago in which you can add amounts of water as you go throughout the day. It resets every day and you can add quantities from your PC watchface quicksettings tile andor homescreen. The project also reminders throughout the day to keep it fresh in your mind. If you look at it close enough youll notice that its just a quantity tracker and that it can be easily modified to track anything... even grams of sugar! All youd have to do make some simple changes.Let me know if you are interested and I can help modify it to suit your needs.,tasker,deesqqf,2,t5_2s0ro

11443648,0,t1_dft40qp,Some people swear by AutoLocation with its geofences its likely to be a bit more accurate than Taskers builtin geofences because AutoLocation uses fused location and I think Tasker just uses Net or GPS separately rather than fusing. Youd need to have Wifi enabled to take advantage of AutoLocation but you might have that enabled anyway.,tasker,dft4l69,2,t5_2s0ro
11451546,0,t1_dftynwe,AutoTools can force connection to certain SSID. As I mentioned Im using the same SSID for all  APs. In my case the only way I can think of forcing connection to AP with the strongest signal would be using BSSID mac address.,tasker,dfu0v09,2,t5_2s0ro
11462843,0,t1_dfrftp7,Actually  a context of any nongame application including homescreen with Invert checked linked to an action of Go Home should constantly just send the device to the homescreen.That combined with setting a password in Tasker itself would do it andor locking the Profile. utexdiver,tasker,dfvb14m,1,t5_2s0ro

11800564,0,t1_dgwp5ol,Yeah converting it to minutes then back to hours probably would be easiest. Or rather than doing a subtraction store the deadlines.. add .. if fraction gt . then add .. if greater than  then subtract Youre probably better off doing this on compare rather than on store as people who bug you during driving are hopefully unlikely to pester you again.,tasker,dgxmv15,1,t5_2s0ro
