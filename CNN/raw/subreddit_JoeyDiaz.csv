9916714,0,t3_5haj8v,I watched last night tbh it seemed like he was still nervous so his timing wasnt on point and it wasnt his best material. From listening to the podcast it sounded like he just used what he came up with in the couple months between the surgery and the taping.  I think he does better with short formats like This Is Not Happening. I cant complain because the podcast is where he shines and it was free. Stay black.,JoeyDiaz,db067ic,5,t5_2tjpo
