4814391,0,t1_cu1e1pr,AH no... But we had a few awesome experiences. One of the guys we were with not in this picture is ftin tall and . He had a few fans too. THis is from our travle blogOn the ferry we attracted a lot of attention from several of the Japanese school classes. Especially the tall Sensei. Some brave girls wanted a picture with sensei and he obliged. The girls and a very select few of the boys find us all terribly interesting and they seek some sort of acknowledgement  from us. Usually they just say Hello or Hiiiiiii although certain brave individuals stop to stammer their way through a sentence or two. The school classes we pass all say hi and a lot of them want and get high fives.This girl just stared in awe at Sensei before her friend dared ask for a picture THis girl dared to ask for the picture Ill skip to the next day in this blogpost now because on the beach the day after we all stood admiring the Torii gate and looked at the Myriad of Schoolchildren. Suddenly up popped a girl drew her breath stepped up to Sensei and said Do... Do you remember me?Senseis smile was priceless! He replied Yes from the boat yesterday and the smile DoyouremembermeSan gave was the biggest this humble blogger ever saw on a Japanese girl and believe you me that is saying A LOT!Her teacher even spoke to us later and thanked us for being so kind. Posing for photos is just fun and we hope that the girls remember the tiny Norwegians.,japanpics,cu1e6tg,3,t5_2vnt5
