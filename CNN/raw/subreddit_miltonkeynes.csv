3066682,0,t1_cofuorj,Hello! Depends entirely on what other folks are interested in. I guess firstly it would just be chatting and possibly meeting up for a beer and to see if people get on then look at ideas for walks and hikes depending on peoples thoughts. Im ben in Newport pagnell  male work in the outdoor industry like to get out as often as possible for anything from little flat walks to a spot of easy mountaineering.. Easy going and happy just to be outside! ,miltonkeynes,cofuwhj,1,t5_2sldz
