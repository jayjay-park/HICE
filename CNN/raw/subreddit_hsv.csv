4058074,0,t1_criuilt,Kannst Dich noch an vor ein paar Jahren erinnern? Die Spiele gegen St Pauli waren furchtbar. Gott wie der Pauli Torman im Volkspark den Mladen vorgefhrt hat. Da wird mir heute noch schlecht. Was die kleinen Stdte angeht mir hat ein Freund heute einen Artikel weitergeleitet. Such ich schnell. Wird dann Edit.Edit natrlich FAZ Geht es explizit unter anderem darum dass Ingoldstadt Karlsruhe usw winzig sind. ,hsv,criumvl,0,t5_2qt6s
4058273,0,t1_crivbbe,N. Die Gewaltbereiten Sdhessen gehen zur Eintracht. D Spa beiseite aber ein greres Gewaltproblem gab es in der Darmstdter Fanszene in den letzten Jahren nicht.Edit Schwer zu sagen was bei einem Spiel gegen die Eintracht passiert Fantrennung ist um das Stadion in Darmstadt nur schwer mglich das wre fr die Polizei sicher eine Herausforderung.,hsv,crivgao,2,t5_2qt6s

8745037,0,t3_4zu7nu,Holy shit nice attack! Kostic is so fucking fast!,hsv,d6ys78u,1,t5_2qt6s
8932133,0,t1_d7ki1o3,Im not sure they need two strikers up front. Its early but bobby wood seems to be pretty active. I think  kostic and muller on the sides AH in the middle holtby and ekdal behind him could be a really solid side. They just need to get a run of games to get more comfortable than they are now. I really dont see gregoritsch as a number  its baffles me. ,hsv,d7lidy0,4,t5_2qt6s
9058782,0,t1_d80l9ft,Thats how Im thinking too but then theres Didis opinion which is different. However if hes gonna sack Bruno I dont want to have Gisdol as his successor either. Probably cheaper than VillasBoas though,hsv,d80pxsn,2,t5_2qt6s

9286580,0,t1_d8t4upk,i think well play with  strikers again next time wood just wasnt at  iirc. that should help us going forward,hsv,d8t536m,3,t5_2qt6s
9311663,0,t1_d8w9qji,It was definitely a foul but it was not a red and it was outside the box. If you go back and look you will see Stindls right calf making contact with Clebers left leg.,hsv,d8wblc4,2,t5_2qt6s
9525034,0,t1_d9n08o6,Ekdal in midfield I thought really helped and taking off Lasogga who cant control the ball for his life for Waldschmidt made us look much more fluid up front. As much as I like PML I think Waldschmidt should start next game. I think Waldschmidts ability to run with the ball and his control is much more useful than lumping it up to Lasogga and having him lose it. ,hsv,d9n5ubh,5,t5_2qt6s

10178923,0,t1_dbxtndr,Well we have acquired Mavraj already. So Djourou isnt our last CB.But you are right we really NEED atleast one more CB.,hsv,dbxu5a1,5,t5_2qt6s
10253091,0,t1_dc67h76,Thats exactly what I just said. They cant make the clause less but can buy back afterwards for less. I didnt disagree was just making sure you knew. ,hsv,dc68sqd,1,t5_2qt6s
10273970,0,t1_dc5v2n1,I find it always quite hilarious when the argument He cant defend is brought up. Looking at the situation the HSV is in and the goal difference of  I would argue that nobody in this team can defend. Also he is a offensive player should he be judged upon his defensive qualities? I dont think so.Diaz and Rincon too where not good enough for the HSv and now look where they play. ,hsv,dc8lzc2,2,t5_2qt6s
10380677,0,t3_5ok04e,When I started watching the Bundesliga during college I saw more HSV matches than most other teams I think Fox Soccer Channel had some kind of deal with particular teams maybe? I remember seeing Bayern amp HSV more than anyone else. This was the  season back when Van der Vaart was good I liked the diverse international makeup of the team I liked the uniforms and I liked the relative underdogs rather than buytheleague Bayern. Ive been following them ever since. Someday Ill make it over there for a match!,hsv,dckppnk,9,t5_2qt6s

10719263,0,t1_ddlh1zr,Haha perfect someone who hates them possibly more than I do! You deserve a golden Djourou flair when he leaves this summer. ,hsv,ddlm29y,2,t5_2qt6s

10827739,0,t1_ddwsnxt,Exactly. If we can pull this off against a good Freiburg side with our depletions this would be an excellent result. Had you told me that wed been without all those guys before the game started and offered me a draw I probably would have taken it. ,hsv,ddwszco,1,t5_2qt6s

11804174,0,t1_dgy1ira,No Mller and Kostic really destroys our offence... And now that our defence is good I wish we had a Halilovic to help out up front with some creativity...,hsv,dgy1lgv,2,t5_2qt6s
