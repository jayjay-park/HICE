Limited ammo makes ammo conservation important but the games generous enough to allow panicky bulletbomb spamming once in a while. Gameplay is definitely fast and scary with scary and fast monsters chasing you around shooter! but theres definitely room for smart patient play survival! that allows you to keep your HP and ammo reserves updeath is YOUR fault. Play as though your character is a squishy nerd surrounded by lessthansquishy mutants! The minimalistic presentation really builds atmosphere the pixely monsters are immediately distinguishable from each other and only scarier for their lack of detail whereas they might have been campy with more detail and the lack of a soundtrack allows the space base to exude deadness coldness and loneliness. ,gamesyoumightnotknow,cnmql1t,5,t5_35emn
