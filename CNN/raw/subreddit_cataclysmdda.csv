3310714,0,t3_2y29gx,If you have fun loading up on ammo like that then by all means have at it. But there are a few points to note   If you get to the point where you can break into a single gunstore you can usually find enough bullets that it really doesnt matter  Youll end up with bodies scattered all across the map as far as I have seen upwards of a few hundred squares total are usable for the purpose of spawning so very little bang for your buck.  Bullets do not make you immortal. Far from it actually. In the early game Ive found that using bullets as a crutch leads to a severe case of falsesuperiority you can kill any individual zombie so you start to feel that you can take on the world. Then you run out of bullets. Then you see a zombear or worse a shocker brute.I have personally found that even as a rangedstart its best to start training a closecombat skill sooner rather than later. This might be less true for renewable ammo such as bows but  bullets just doesnt last very long especially when your character will miss  shots from more than a few squares away. Choose your targets avoid mobs and take out the odd zedhead that gets to close with your knife. Keep the gun for the REAL threats like aforementioned shocker brutes.,cataclysmdda,cp5ndhc,3,t5_2wktw

3535893,0,t3_30qp1w,Definitely consider increasing the game resolution if your monitor allows. As others have noted you will get significantly more gameplay area as you do since the sidebar will always stay the same width. From the main menu Options gt Graphics gt Terminal LengthWidthBut in addition to that the specific settings youre looking for are in the Cataclysmconfigfonts.json file. Open it with a text editor such as Notepad.The first set of four options control the font used in menus so sidebar inventory screen stuff like that. Youll probably want to leave those alone. Of note here editing the fontwidth or fontheight settings will actually affect the whole games resolution since those are multiplied by the Terminal LengthWidth values in the options menu to determine the final resolution.The next set of four options that start with map control the font used in the gameplay area. So increasing mapfontwidth to be equal to mapfontheight will give you the square font you want without stretching the sidebar or other menus.The final set of four options that start with overmap control the font used in the map that you bring up by pressing the m button in game. Like before increase overmapfontwidth to be equal to overmapfontheight if you want that square as well.You may want to play around with the options farther though. For example simply raising the fontwidth options to  gives you square text but it leaves a lot of unnecessary dead space between the characters like thisIf I lower both fontwidth and fontheight settings to  everything fits better in my opinion,cataclysmdda,cpvbcee,1,t5_2wktw

You might have one zed beating on a car or building with an alarm and before you know it the whole area will be absolutely filled with the undead. The game will even start throwing errors because it cant place more zombies in already occupied tiles. You can also get zombies spawning inside enclosed areas way out in the wilderness or other weirdness.Wander spawns are a little different. Wander spawns are a simulated limited pool of zombies which are attached to a city. They roam around as small groups on the overmap and are loosely attracted to noise. The game only spawns zombies when one of these groups enters the players reality bubble. If the player leaves the area theyll go back to being a simulated horde. Wander spawns generally dont appear very far out in the wild and will tend to congregate in cities. Although the pool of spawns may be very large you can eventually clear them out.I usually play with both static spawns and wander spawns. Dynamic spawns are just too broken.,cataclysmdda,d0y7qfh,4,t5_2wktw

9097425,0,t3_54vple,Heres my take. Im biased toward mm over . I prefer the low dispersion low recoil and crazy high availability of the mm round.Pistol LB or Glock  for common ammo. The LB hits harder with its burst fire the Glocks can fit in an ankle holster. RM for rare ammo. It hits like an SMG and doesnt give a shit about armor.  Rifle FN SCARH for common ammo. Ammo with low dispersion and heavy punch good for sniping good for fullauto emergencies does pretty much everything. RM for rare ammo. Super compact and low recoil spray all day when necessary. RM is also good gives bigger burst and a little more damage at cost of volume and recoil.  SMG Calico M or MP for common ammo. Calico has a huge burst MP has slightly more accuracy and jams less often. Not sure on rare ammo I rarely use SMGs late game. The RM SPIW and RM both seem pretty good.  Shotgun Saiga for common ammo. The drum magazine gives you a hilarious amount of boom. RM for rare ammo. Only autoshotgun using xmm wins by default.,cataclysmdda,d85d3ui,15,t5_2wktw

9695438,0,t3_5dy3qu,It depends the back holster has a base encumbrance of . Compare how much encumbrance your strapped Mossberg has when worn to figure out if it would be better or worse. Also keep in mind that a back holster occupies the strapped layering location which means that if youre wearing a backpack you will get a small encumbrance penalty for wearing both.Im not  sure if this is still the case but if you saw down the barrel and install a folding stock then you can fit the Mossberg in a regular hip holster which has the added advantage of quick draw based on your dexterity which the back holster doesnt allow.

9946672,0,t3_5hyexc,People asking for explanation the nice people at roguenex.us have put up a server running a persistent map multiplayer version of cataclysm dda!That means once you log in youll be playing on a map where you can occasionally come across the constructions or wrecks of previous players or even their bodies and loot!The only way I know to connect is via SSH which sadly doesnt allow for tiles if anyone knows different please tell me!Linux users and Mac... I think? can connect via the ssh command. Windows users will have to download a standalone ssh program like Kitty and enter the information username player port  address roguenex.us the password hint is at the link above.In addition to the persistent map feature you dont have to install anything or compile the latest version of the game they did all that for you. You can also play from any computer and your save will carry over. As far as I know you can also watch other players as they play but I havent tested this yet as no one else has been logged in at the same time as me Lastly theyre working to add more roguelikes soon although only cataclysm is available now.Hope to see you all there!

The current Dark Days Ahead build is a mod team that picked up development after Whales started to drop working on the game regurally.Originally the mod was created by another developer who Im pretty sure is one of the mods for this Subreddit uTheDarklingWolf. It garnered a mod team and now were in this interesting cycle of constant development. Im not sure about the internal logistics of when Granade took over as it were but thats besides the point.Cataclysm  as supposed to be a reboot by Whales in his own vision though it seems to have fallen flat. I was never particularly interested. While I love original Whales Cataclysm the game has grown immensely and wonderfully over the years so much so that I cant even imagine trying to go back to its roots.

11028078,0,t1_degecyk,They used to commit suicide somewhat frequently. Back in the day when a codeprogramming error came up with an already spawned npc theyd do that. Personally I think they should still do it once in a while after certain triggers like murdering a bunch of kid zeds or anything that would drop a player characters morale way low and it staying low for an extended period. ,cataclysmdda,dei0aa0,3,t5_2wktw

11216278,0,t3_5t3e0t,Basically has a survivor who reached level  or so in rifles skill. This was a month or two before the introduction of gun magazines. Skill rust but with the enhanced memory banks permanently on. Once she got into the groove of things her main weapon of choice was the M IAR with pretty much all the important mods to turn that rifle into a killer. She did some cool featsEncounter a tank drone in broad daylight. Tank drone saw her but before it could get into firing range she destroyed the tank with several shots without moving from her position.Likewise sniped the thriller then sniped the rest of the dancers turned hulks. By the time some hulks got close enough there were only about  left and she got out with barely any damage.Basically oneshot killed most zombies that got in her way.That M was so good it outshined the Barrett MA since the former has a better range of mods to attach. She was also real good with several other guns.After tearing through hordes with the IAR she upgraded and went with a hypervelocity driver mounted on a bikelike car she made.Result going into towns crowded with zombies and depopulating them with the steel rails fired from the hypervelocity driver. Everything that wasnt a zombie hulk would get obliterated in one shot though some needed another shot or two to completely vaporize the remains.That pretty much meant that zombie drops were gone due to repeated shots but afterwards she can waltz into the streets in broad daylight or walk around at night with a flashlight and loot everything from the buildings.,cataclysmdda,df3cnzq,1,t5_2wktw
11218502,0,t1_df3f714,Not bad! Sheltered start puts you in winter. I think the cataclysm happens in early spring so the zombies have had more than half a year to evolve especially so if you changed the evolve modifier. Also you may just be getting unlucky by not seeing a normal zombie. Im sure theyre around somewhere. But yeah that sounds rough. Weak scent can help to avoid them.At the beginning of the game preserving meat requires a lot of resources for little pay off when its probably quite a bit easier to find more animals to killscavenge food from housesscavenge food from forest bushes. ,cataclysmdda,df3lqbf,3,t5_2wktw
11223393,0,t1_df45fs8,Ive never actually used wiring before so Im not sure give it a try and see what happens. You could use a vehicle door or windshield in place of the window or structure door. Just be wary of knocking down existing windows since the game likes to decide at not exactly but close enough to random that things will collapse because of what you did.I have my doubts about it being able to go through a door and have the door shut on it though. But hey maybe.,cataclysmdda,df45ou1,3,t5_2wktw

11317703,0,t3_61ii7z,Easiest solution is to just move the funnel to the dirty tank. I cant imagine both tanks would run out at the same time so moving it should not cause any issues.
