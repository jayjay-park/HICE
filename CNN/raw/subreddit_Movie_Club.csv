4729270,0,t3_3fp0pe,With this movie and Grave of the Fireflies I think Isao Takahata is at the same level as Miyazaki. He just isnt as prolific. ,Movie_Club,ctqnyx2,2,t5_3978o
4844853,0,t1_cu53k7d,Agreed.  With those I just sort of do the LALALALALALA LOOK AWAY FOR A FEW MOMENTS to the ones under .  The others?  Eh theyre probably more embarrassed than me to be watching it with their old man.,Movie_Club,cu58alk,1,t5_3978o

6538890,0,t3_45684e,I like that its hidden. Makes me feel like my obscure suggestions may just get picked one week.Thats why sunday mystery is actually the best because it may not be the most popular movies and i find the movies are more often one that someone just wants to share with people.  I love to tune in to catch a movie that ive never seen before!,Movie_Club,czvoahi,5,t5_3978o
6848808,0,t1_d0qvo5a,Yeah its definitely one of those that can really leave you guessing if you miss a key point in it but I love that style of storytelling. ,Movie_Club,d0smb9d,1,t5_3978o

10362307,0,t3_5oc3yg,The GameIts great. Its Finchers first major movie made a couple of years before Fight Club and its clearly the more suspenseful of the two.Edit A more lighthearted thriller would be Charade with Audrey Hepburn from  IIRC. Its pretty exciting while being funny as well.,Movie_Club,dcimn6b,5,t5_3978o
