3820245,0,t1_cqrl8cy,Every running VM requires a Hardware Abstraction Layer  even if you run headless ie no video abstraction.  And the kernel itself eats up significant resources.   A container sits upon an already running Kernel.  It only abstracts the userspace per se.  Filesystem and processes specific to the application being containerized. times is a conservative estimate.  But you are right.  Hardware is cheap... And Enterprise Data Center budgets are cheaper.   Im pretty sure that your boss would not decline the opportunity to wring even twice the workload out of the same hardware especially as IaaS and Paas take over. ,cloudcomputing,cqrqmbf,1,t5_2rbzr

Its not necessarily cloud but you could run it on a cloud and do things like add and remove workers on the fly as demand dictates.,cloudcomputing,d0jmxtg,1,t5_2rbzr
