3843714,0,t3_34f4qe,After researching the various theories I found the wikipedia summary to be pretty accurate in that no one agrees and many more remain skeptical.gtVarious hypotheses and theories have been proposed explaining the underlying physics for how the EmDrive and related designs might be producing thrust. Shawyer claims that thrust is caused by a radiation pressure imbalance between the two faces of the cavity caused by the action of group velocity in different frames of reference within the framework of special relativity. Yang from NWPU calculated the net forcethrust using classical electromagnetism. Harold G. Sonny White who investigates field propulsion at Eagleworks NASAs Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory speculated that such resonant cavities may operate by creating a virtual plasma toroid that could realize net thrust using magnetohydrodynamic forces acting upon quantum vacuum fluctuations. Likewise the paper describing the Eagleworks test of the Cannae drive referred to a possible interaction with a socalled quantum vacuum virtual plasma. This reference has been criticized by mathematical physicists John Baez and Sean M. Carroll because in the standard description of vacuum fluctuations virtual particles do not behave as a plasma.,EmDrive,cquf1ah,2,t5_32vrh
3848715,0,t1_cquyr86,If you read my comment you would notice that I said that we dont know enough about the scalability of the drive to answer you will also notice that I never said the drive would be able to achieve the speeds I said all I did was calculate speed and acceleration for a hypothetical craft that gives a constant  N of thrust. I never made any claims that an Emdrive craft would be capable of this just that it could be capable of this assuming that the figures that have come out of the few experiments that have been done are accurate. Therefore I do not believe that my post requires a disclaimer because I didnt make any claims.

Just dividing the force measured by the projected area in thrust direction gives us this thrustarea or in simpler terms a pressure difference needed between front and back. Let me assume the values for the vacuum test NASA performed. A small calculation but yields . torr. Which is at the same order of magnitude of the pressure they are measuring at. This is not a perfect vacuum and such a pressure difference can easily be achieved by uneven heating. It also shows that measuring thrust at ambient conditions is idiotic.

4576047,0,t1_ct6u1nz,From that referencegtThe complex angular reflection and transmission coefficients  and T for TE waves approach those given by .. and .. for normal incidence in the limit i  .  The limit of grazing incidence is not so simple and even the form of the transmitted wave can change markedly if it becomes evanescent.They are not excluded or directly predicted by maxwells equations.  This is a boundary problem which if youve done much work with Maxwells equations youll know that sometimes defining a perfect boundary condition is not possible.  This makes solving Maxwells equations difficult.Take the case of total internal reflected light  .gtFor example consider total internal reflection in two dimensions with the interface between the media lying on the x axis the normal along y and the polarization along z. One might naively expect that for angles leading to total internal reflection the solution would consist of an incident wave and a reflected wave with no transmitted wave at all but there is no such solution that obeys Maxwells equations. Maxwells equations in a dielectric medium impose a boundary condition of continuity for the components of the fields E|| H|| Dy and By. For the polarization considered in this example the conditions on E|| and By are satisfied if the reflected wave has the same amplitude as the incident one because these components of the incident and reflected waves superimpose destructively. Their Hx components however superimpose constructively so there can be no solution without a nonvanishing transmitted wave. The transmitted wave cannot however be a sinusoidal wave since it would then transport energy away from the boundary but since the incident and reflected waves have equal energy this would violate conservation of energy. We therefore conclude that the transmitted wave must be a nonvanishing solution to Maxwells equations that is not a traveling wave and the only such solutions in a dielectric are those that decay exponentially evanescent waves.In order for these waves to be compliant with Maxwells field equations they have to be conservative even if the boundary conditions cant be satisfied.These type of waves decay fast and are considered a nearfield effect.  As such they are highly nonlinear and short lived.,EmDrive,ct7f2n9,3,t5_32vrh

Then you could argue it cant exist because the results are nonphysical and couldnt happen in our world because the resulting paradoxes violate causality.While you seem to be a fairly reasonable person Im going to go out on a limb and say youre not a physicist.

But it wouldnt help you as much as reading the whole paper yourself and understanding the math   pp.  and  are where he states the answer to your question explicitly in words.gtAnyway its a moot point. Show me negative mass and then we can have a discussion on the merits of the Alcubierre drive. This is the main point.  While the derivation is correct in GR it is unphysical.  Anyone who tries to show otherwise with benign and unmotivated being kind here experimental ideas like White are practicing fringe science.  But that doesnt make the Alcubierre Drive itself fringe.  By the way its more correct to say the energy density is negative not the mass since it is the T component of the stressenergy tensor which becomes negative in Alcubierres paper.

But I never understood how signal to noise ratios are a reason for not scaling up.  It seems like thats why you should scale up.  The amount of things that might generate micronewtons surely would be much greater than the amount of things that could generate whole newtons.  It seems to me either of two things would happen.  Either the error does scale with the size of the device in which case it should be easier to identify just what exactly that error is or it doesnt scale with the size of the device in which case if the device works it works and if it doesnt well then you go back to testing smaller versions.,EmDrive,cx37f7s,2,t5_32vrh

8925792,1,t1_d7juwfi,I have a theory on the behaviors of mindguards of academic of politicians in science or in enterpreuneurship.Entrepreneurs inventors real scientist venture capitalists are hunting blackswan.they invest resources they own their time their own life their money their clients and they are ready to lose it.In exchange from a probable failure they expect and unpredictable success of huge potential value.The bankers finance men like academic politicians out of politics itself do the opposite.They earn their life from others assets taking with high probability a tiny margin. they accept to take incredibly huge risk or low probability because they will just change job or be discrete if they are wrong.There is a specificity with academic and thus with mindguards.An academic enjoy budget granted by fearful comitees who prefer boring predictable useless research to any research which may endanger their image if failing triggering citizen groups like nasawatch.So rationally an academic have to refuse anything risky for himself but he can also like a banker accumulate good image by attacking blackswan projects that will probably  fails. If project success they will just keep silent and attack another blackswan because successful team will have more interest in positive question than in revenge.BUT there is an even better no risk method DEMAND TO STOP RESEARCH.if as a mindguard you gather good image notes by attacking blackswan hunters you can avoid any risk of losing by forbidding research by blocking funding by blocking publication...this is a no risk technique and even if you faile sometime successful team have other business to do than take revenge and ruine mindguard careers as it would be profitable on the longterm.,EmDrive,d7kqz8b,1,t5_32vrh

Heatsink is not the only thing that heats up and moves. So okay they fix the heatsink. They still have dozens of components that are heating and bending.edit I think I know why it is so sensitive to the movements of the centre of mass. Their pendulum is almost but not quite vertical. The centre of mass is very close to the pendulums axis the pendulum ends up with the centre of mass down. If the centre of mass is mm from the axis and the drive is mm from the axis then the movement of the centre of mass is magnified by up to  times at the point where the drive is. Theres a childrens playground toy where you sit in a round cup whose axis is very slightly off vertical your centre of mass is near the axis and you roll around with slightest movements. Surely if a kid can get it to spin you cant just conclude you got a future flying superhero...If the pendulums axis was precisely vertical as it is in the traditional torsion pendulum that has one suspension and a laser reflecting off a mirror mounted on the axis then the movements of the centre of mass would not result in the shift of noforce position of the pendulum.,EmDrive,d9x5jk7,4,t5_32vrh

I will ask Paul March directly.That reminds me of  McCullochs most recent  postgt dielectric means that Unruh waves will be slower and have shorter wavelengths and so more of them will fit at the narrow end. MiHsC therefore predicts that having a dielectric at one end is rather like widening that end and if you put it at the narrow end then you reduce the taper and reduce the thrust.,EmDrive,davgmtz,2,t5_32vrh

9899622,0,t1_daxwwkw,gtWell thats what we are told but why doe that happen? From the traveling observer its earth thats undergoing the acceleration. Ignoring obvious gforces. But why are they obvious? We just used to them but whats causing them? Answer is quite simple really it gravitational induction and autoinduction it has been proven that matter have more inertia in presence of external gravitational fields. So movement is not relative after all you are moving against... thats right either. Twin paradox proves the existence of either as well as frame dragging observed near rotating black holes when light takes longer time to move against the spin of it then towards it on the other side.You seem confused about what the twin paradox is. Gravity plays no role in it at all. If you want imagine that one twin is floating in empty space instead of sitting on earth while the other travels away from him turn around and comes back. The situation is not symmetric since the twin that traveled have accelerated and changed directions etc. So there is no paradox. You should probably go read a book about special relativity if you are interested in these things because you seem quite confused about the basic things and keep mixing in concepts that are not relevant. Also its spelled aether not either. That made it even more confusing trying to read your comment.  gtIt only predicts that we are wrong and how much we are wrong its a patchwork. When dark matter particles will be discovered and proven to be responsible for the observed effects then Ill accept it. Until then its just a mathematical model describing the error no wonder there are myriads of hypothetical candidates for dark matter particleI keep reiterating that saying that something only predicts how and how much we are wrong as a criticism is stupid but you dont seem to get it. GR also only predicts how much Newtonian gravity is wrong. Every new theory does that. If you proposed another theory to explain dark matter in some other way it would still only predict that we are wrong and how much we are wrong. There is no way to do better than that. I mean even if we have a direct detection the model is still just a mathematical model describing the error i.e. our observations. We would just have one more observation that fits the data. What matters in science is having a lot of data enough so that we can say that a particular model is statistically significant. Since we already have a lot of astronomical observations we already have that for dark matter. Direct detection is of course great and itll tell us more about the exact nature of the dark matter but we can still say a fair amount without it. And yeah its the frontier of physics research. Of course there will be many different candidates thats how science is supposed to work. With more data and better experiments we can narrow it down and learn more about which model is correct. ,EmDrive,daxxzjr,3,t5_32vrh

If you are talking about the dark energy that seem to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe today well... it seems to be a property of the vacuum that we have a small positive cosmological constant. I.e. a small vacuum energy that is just a property of the vacuum. Why we have a small positive cosmological constant is a proper mystery that nobody really has any good ideas about.

10132978,0,t1_dbpum8s,Do you mind if I try to help you sharpen this point up a bit?    Youre right but let me try to put it differentlyThee global symmetries of general spacetime are not necessarily the global symmetries of flat spacetime.  In particular the global symmetries of de Sitter are not those of Minkowski.Special Relativity is defined within its own tangent space at the origin and consequently has a global Lorentz symmetry because the tangent space covers the whole of the spacetime.   You are right that the global symmetry can be viewed as broken but I dont think that view helps as much as recognizing that in a general curved spacetime it never exists to be broken in the first place.   However there there is always Lorentz symmetry on the tangent space.Heres a nice picture of a tangent space at a an origin the point in blue on a sphere     The tangent space of a point infinitesimally close to the depicted point will be indistinguishable at close range but infinite lines in the two tangent spaces will not necessarily be parallel.And its fairly obvious in the image that if one chooses a point on the sphere distant from the blue dot that one can get sets of lines along an axis that are parallel within one of the two tangent spaces that intersect with lines that are parallel along the same axis within the other tangent space and that the intersection is very near the two points.  This nonparallelism is a feature of the geometry of the manifold rather than a result of e.g. boosts and cannot be removed by only a change of coordinates.Special Relativity is defined within each of the tangent bundles but not between the two tangent bundles or equivalently quantities remain Poincarinvariant when the both the quantity and the observer are in the same tangent bundle.The Poincarinvariance of these quantities leads inexorably to the conservation arguments via Noethers theorem.ETA dont try to write this sort of thing when tired  I think my attempt to avoid being excruciatingly technical and also trying to use the nice image above has led to a confusing mess in the middle of the comment.   I wasnt trying to write for fuckspellingerrors who probably knows this stuff already or at least could grok a statement about using the structure of the metric on M to turn M itself into an affine space which probably doesnt help make the point to Namesmeannothing.,EmDrive,dbsbz53,3,t5_32vrh

10685262,0,t1_ddi33do,Well beyond political risk and even beyond the cost involved not just getting it up there but people running the experiments it also means bumping off some other project.  That seems like a small price to pay for proponents but is a big price for someone else.,EmDrive,ddi3rdj,2,t5_32vrh

Maybe Prof. Mike got inspiration from that.Edit Almost forgot to say! What a crazy crackpot Big Mike truly is.,EmDrive,ddxn695,3,t5_32vrh
11086617,0,t1_deon5y9,gt Without conservation laws the Universe is  pure unadulterated magic. You cannot have a violation of conservation laws and still have those conservation laws. no.  I have newtons laws  and I have a violation of newtons laws.  There can be a situation where a conservation law does not hold  but that it holds in almost all situations especially when averaged over macroscopic scales.For instance one cannot have both an uncertainty law for momentum  and conservation of momentum.,EmDrive,deonpfx,2,t5_32vrh
11160588,0,t1_dewxiq5,gt If a client comes up to you and claims they found a special way to tally their figures so that there is more money at the end then the beginging just by adding and subtracting over and over which is more likely that they created money from the void or that there is a calculation error?Hopefully there is always more money at the end than the beginning or they might be in trouble. If thats the case a simple bank reconciliation will find omissions and errors. We are always trying to find figures which make sense like when clients dont know how much they spend from cash in hand we can still tally the sales receipts vs cash deposits and come to some conclusions on what is happening. Extra cash at the end of the period could be down to undocumented business or a disposal of assets. Or illegal activitys like laundering. Odds are you cant explain it you report it. If its substantial.Back to the science mumbo jumbo obviously i assumed it worked and from there i worked backwards. I would be grateful if someone could drill a hole one of these cavitys and weld a valve to it then get a pump a vacuum it. I dont know if my nonsense is valid or not i would have though removing the gas inside the cavity would be vital for a control test no matter what. The air gas in it is about  oxygen oxygen is paramagnetic and as a liquid it sticks to magnets that alone could be stuck to one side of these rigs and simple weighing the rig to one side. Going to a gas to a liquid with heat does not make sense to me but maybe as a plasma is oxygen magnetic while as a plasma? i dont know but a simple vacuumed control would rule it out all that nonsense.If its works IF one of these crazy bird brain ideas might be on to something. ,EmDrive,dex1h3g,1,t5_32vrh
