3592235,0,t1_cq1qikl,The formula I use is cost of materials times  plus an hourly rate. That gives you a wholesale price that you double for retail. That being said I adjust my hourly rate based on skill sets required for the project. I take that the amount from that formula and adjust up or down for what I think is a fair market price. And I put a lot of hours and care into my work so I never figure in the true cost of my labor. The men I work with who know welding and metal working from an industrial POV say my work is easily worth hr. A simple pair of wire wrapped earrings I price my labor at hr. I have priced commissioned jobs at  and had my friendscustomers agree to the price without batting an eye. And my people are blue collar people. So thats my method. But I hate trying to price as well. I even explain my formula to customers and they appreciate it and agree with the pricing structure. And like I said I simply cant charge for all the time I put in because I love polishing and refining. And I certainly cant charge for the four hrs I put in before I fucked it up and started all over. Lol. ,Benchjewelers,cq1qq6f,3,t5_37ovz

3876294,0,t1_cqw8uoy,That would be neat. I spend a lot of time on Rio Grandes website they have base metal and precious things like bezel pendants or rings with bezels. Toss a few gearshands in the bottom and use one of the clear resins. Obviously if youve got the workshop for it you can make your own bezels. I like the idea of doming them and filling with resin. You could prong set them after that or bezel just like anything else. Or put a rivet through it....now I want to go make something too.,Benchjewelers,cqy4q0w,2,t5_37ovz
4117272,0,t1_crpl9ob,My new soldering book has a project with a business card holder that looks pretty cool. And yeah its really not that hard. Just takes patience and precision but thats the case for producing quality work with any casting or jewlery making. amd I agree about a whole new level of fun. The guys at work are already amazed at my work can you imagine the reaction when I show them hinged boxes Ive made? D ,Benchjewelers,crplfk5,1,t5_37ovz

5583908,0,t3_3rlqkj,Ive only cast white gold once and I have no idea what the whitening component in the alloy was. The wearer never mentioned nickel allergies. Palladium is the other choice for alloying gold to make white gold but you dont typically have to alloy casting metals yourself. It might different with nickelfree white gold though since its composed of two precious meals whose prices depend on the current market  often independent of each other. Check jewelry suppliers to see what they have many people are dealing with nickel allergies these days and there should be some offtheshelf solutions available.Another option is a silver alloy like Argentium. Its a very white alloy harder than regular sterling and tarnishresistant. There is also electrum an alloy silver and gold  but I dont think it will be as white.Best of luck to you!,Benchjewelers,cwp8hlq,2,t5_37ovz

6193508,0,t3_40eq48,i work on an as needed basis. people have approached with custom orders and sometimes i accept. So its not really a true business because I do it as sort of a hobby. I make more pieces for myself then I really take orders. My father is the professional and I learned everything from him by years of just watching him work. I dont have a formal education in the craft my education is in health care. I really started making jewelry because of my love for lord of the rings ever since the eighth grade. I was finally allowed to make some around college. Despite my fathers best intentions that I do not take after him in the craft I do make things from time to time. He has also volunteered to help with jobs that I take and cant complete. ,Benchjewelers,cytmx78,3,t5_37ovz

8045882,0,t1_d4k193v,With all the different metal densities jump ring light weight chain heavy weight bracelet its tough to get the heat right. If its a stiff solder I will free hand it. If its a hook up I will use a third hand on the jump ring. Sometimes more often than not its tough to get it set up. Anyone wanna empathize here lolEdit free hand soldering a JR with a lightweight chain on it is kind of tedious,Benchjewelers,d4kflzd,1,t5_37ovz
