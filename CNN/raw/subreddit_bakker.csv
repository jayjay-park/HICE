4955830,0,t3_3irg42,Huh. Translated literally the books are.sword and sorcery is the imprint on the topServants of the Dark Lord prince of the void. Warrior of the time of bloodno series name. Downfall of the Holy Cityprince of the void.  the Judging Eye. The Fortunate WarriorNot sure that anyone involved in the illustration or translation of the titles read so much as a page of the books although at least the last two titles arent nonsensical ,bakker,cuj8121,2,t5_2tw1e
9278434,0,t1_d8rx7x9,Arguably is an understatement. I dont know to me it seems Akka resents Kellhus instinctively because of his inhumane superiority his alien nature specifically because he found himself at the butt end of that via Esmi. He doesnt resent him because he has assumed a moral high ground real or imagined based on the harm K. has wrought overall in the pursuit of his goals. He knew that morals were relative and body counts were irrelevant way back at the start of book one when he agreed to sacrifice Inrau.I dont see him actively opposing Kellhus anyway  for all he knows K. could be the real deal and the one true savior that the Mandates been hoping for. All that Akkas been doing for  years is try to figure out what exactly K. is  thus the search for Ishual. Hes obsessively looking for Truth not trying to bring down the AspectEmperor. Though the involvement of Mimara Cnaiur et al. do complicate this longterm goal somewhat. I just hope it doesnt all come down to OK girl power up that Judging Eye look at him and tell me WHAT DO YOU SEE. Ill totally take that as The Truth because fuck my skepticism Im now all about absolutes and blind faith.,bakker,d8s3wto,1,t5_2tw1e
9402080,0,t1_d973dok,gt The Rape of Proyas  I get where youre coming from but again refer to my comment where I mention Kellhuss inner monologue literally explaining how he can forego the brute force methods hed had to rely on for so many years due to his hectic schedule and the demands of Empire. I think youre misreading that brief aside of K.s inner monologue. He just states that he no longer needs such fine manipulations since taking over the Three Seas. He never mentions brute force and I dont think K. would consider rape a significantly more brutal imposition on a subject than anything hed already done to Cnaiur Achamian Proyas or anyone else. He dealt that way with them all offering what they want with one hand then smacking them upside the head with the other training them like dogs. Its all he does.So Kellhus doesnt really need to manipulate Proyas at all  hes already the perfect servant. Hes indulging himself by talking to him by revealing who he really is and how monstrously wrong Proyas was on the nature of divinity. Yes the rape could be a part of that pointless exercise  bolstered by the effect of the Sranc meat K. is also gobbling up  but he might also be remaking Proyas to fit a long term goal.My overall theory is that K. doesnt expect himself or any of his children to survive the Great Ordeal. He plans on achieving some sort of compromise with the Inchoroi perhaps forcing them to accept defeat and destruction in return for saving them from damnation. And the salvation hes aiming for while not universal and ideal is something akin to what MogPharau was meant to perform. So Kellhus becomes the next NoGod in some fashion but instead of enacting global genocide to shut off the world he enacts global deicide  destroying faith as a concept to starve the Outside. This serves the Inchoroi purpose just as well the world is isolated from the divine souls go into the void instead of eternal torment so they acquiesce to being destroyed at K.s hands.To that end Kellhus is preparing Proyas and Saubon for a postKellhus postreligious world. Theyre case studies for him testing what effect ones prophet being revealed as false has on people. Saubon takes it pretty well Proyas crumbles but manages to soldier on somehow. Maybe K. has plans for Saubon and Proyas to maintain some sort of society after hes gone turned into the new NoGod somehow. But then K. realizes he cant save Saubon from the nuke decides that its an acceptable sacrifice Proyas should be enough and teleports away.So I have no problem with Kellhus knowing about radiation sickness or with him raping Proyas  it could all potentially fit into the Thousandfold Thought. What I do have a problem with is him popping back to Momemn to check on Esmenet and the empire. That seems to go against any apocalyptic plan of his for dealing with the Inchoroi.,bakker,d97s3cr,2,t5_2tw1e
