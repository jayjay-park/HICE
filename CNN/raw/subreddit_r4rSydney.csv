Youll find that because youre enjoying what youre doing you become more approachable.For example if you enjoy Comic books go to a nice pub and read them in the beer garden sit on a big table if possible without being rude of course . Youll find people will probably engage you and ask questions about the comic books or what youre reading etc.,r4rSydney,db2p9l1,2,t5_2synl
