6336931,0,t1_cz5jzal,Yes! I would really appreciate a full postpodcast about this because postgrad studies of course assume that you know how to deal with independent study etc and of course we should! But it seems like with less time on our hands for revision as there are many more assignments it feels like a real struggle. I started in September  like Jophiela. Thank you for your kind response ,collegeinfogeek,cz9xtbp,1,t5_3aygy
6340206,0,t3_42gakh,Im in for the experiment if more people show up tldr of the rest of the post if you explain something to someone that doesnt get it so easily so you have to rephrase it the simplest possible way you get SO much better at understanding it yourself. Therefore Feynman is the best.if youre not sure about the Feynman technique I have a story from my personal experience not directly about this technique but indirectly pretty much yes.So this semester I took an additional class  intro to mathematics for economists  because Im an international relations student and I wanted to understand econ better. The lecturer knows me and he knows Im a pretty fast learner when it comes to maths so he proposed that I turor this guy who had a LOT of problems with maths. The uni would pay me for it so I was like sure why not!before I started doing the tutoring I understood everything pretty well. Simply showing up at lectures was enough to do most problems that were thrown at me at workshops. But it wasnt until I had to explain it to that guy again and again and again using simpler and simpler vocabulary that I understood that I only had a vague idea of what was going on. When I actually took more time to prepare to explain everything the simplest possible way I started having less trouble solving more complicated problems those requiring a more creative approach to the rule. Which would basically show the Feynman technique in real life ,collegeinfogeek,czab7f7,1,t5_3aygy

6511753,0,t3_448r87,The assumption you make here is actually ...not all that correct.Neither me nor most of my gamer friends have multiple monitors I play my MMORPGs on my laptop admittedly I do use a mouse and even an external keyboard for convenience.In my office on campus I do have two monitors though. And yes they help being more productive. Starting with I can have a paper Im reading open in one monitor and a reference site on the other to look up words I dont understand English isnt my native language. Depending on the softwares you use two monitors will be very helpful. GIS software for example is something I love to use on two monitor systems and despise on my laptop even though my laptop runs faster than my office desktop.,collegeinfogeek,czsv6b7,1,t5_3aygy
6715714,0,t3_47kbks,I did read somewhere on quora i think that even if the rationale to skip class is to do class work you might as well go the class and do your work there. At least passive thought can occur somewhat. Class cuts down on so much processing time anyways.,collegeinfogeek,d0dyo9d,3,t5_3aygy

7004272,0,t3_4bbwf2,I wonder how deep work and music would interact together.And by music I mean music leaning more on the ambient instrumental nonvocal sounds. Think music by artists such as Stars of the Lid or A Winged Victory for the Sullen. ,collegeinfogeek,d1aa1nz,1,t5_3aygy
7053761,0,t1_d1eed2g,I think there are several methods. Being accountable to yourself through choosing goals based on your values and trying to live a disciplined life. Choosing accountability partners wisely and sharing your goals AND regular progress with them this is part of the purpose of my Jedi Council. Precommiting by using an external system whether that be signing up for a class betting money on it like with Beeminder etc.,collegeinfogeek,d1fwibu,2,t5_3aygy

7933347,0,t3_4nbl43,Good tip if you need a way of avoiding distractions! I can certainly truck through a large portion of an audiobook if Im in the car or on a run.One thing to note though  I believe the average rate of speech in an audio book is around wpm so even at x youre only getting up to about wpm. Getting much faster makes the speech sound pretty garbled to me so unless your reading speed is on the lower end of the normal spectrum using audio probably wont provide a raw speed increase other than potentially helping you stay focused.,collegeinfogeek,d47s6zn,3,t5_3aygy
8413177,0,t1_d5t6gvf,Heres a pasted response from the College Board on Quora Basically it sounds like you could take AP tests but youd have to convince a high school to let you come in and take tests with high school students. I suppose it never hurts to ask! But CLEP and similar tests are a much more welltrodden path for getting ahead and testing out of classes.,collegeinfogeek,d5t6vqx,1,t5_3aygy

10901702,0,t3_5vk8vo,in one of the old college info geek podcasts they talk about sleep and the expert Thomas interviewed said to try to wake up within like  minutes of your normal time and just be tired on those days because the sleep deprivation will make you sleep better the next night and if you sleep in too late itll hurt your circadian rhythm more than the couple hours sleep is worth,collegeinfogeek,de4flmz,3,t5_3aygy
