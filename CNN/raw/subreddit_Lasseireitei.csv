86,0,t1_cee9srx,ShernerThe Battle for Everyones SoulsSherner had been talking with Arata for a few moments when the barrier suddenly overtook the area. Sherner gave him a confused and concerned look before flashing off to see what was happening. Looking  on in confusion before he felt the crushing weight of Seraphim reitsu.... Big Trouble. Sherner could tell no one who was currently near the manor would be able to handle this that is until he felt the Captain commanders reitsu suddenly spike. Quietly Sherner bringer stepped off behind some cover and peered out at what was going on. At the moment the best option was to gather as much information as he could. Rukia would be far to busy actually dealing with the Seraphim to be able to pick up every detail. noticing the hundreds if not thousands of odd apples floating about the area Sherner looked on as Rukia spun and stabbed the Seraph in the skull. What Sherner thought was an obvious killing blow seemed to be ultimately shrugged off. Watching the apples seem to regenerate the man Sherner thought back to the reports Rukia left about an extremely powerful Seraphim and paired it together..... Averonis. Watching the battle continue Rukia had lost access to her zanpaktou and the apples seemed to be keeping Averonis alive. He needed to reequip Rukia and destroy the apples while Rukia kept him busy. It was then that the gem in Sherners pouch became noticeably hot. could it be that this gem was attuned to the Seraphim in some way....Quietly Sherner began to charge up his aura aiming to take out a large chunk of the apples with it. slowly the aura began to wrap around his body and then to the tips of his kunai. Using the focusing techniques kylar had taught him. The swirling energies becoming more and more intense before he slashed outwards unleasing a massive hell storm of swirling energy from his hiding spot attempting to whipe out as many of the apples that he could that were behind rukia. not waiting to see if his idea worked Sherner quickly pointed a finger towards Averonis and a small white orb appeared and quickly began to give off a hazy steam to burden Averonises sight and sensing abilitys. After a few seconds a moderate sized cloud had formed in the area and Sherner bringer stepped into the cloud towards Averonis while he held Rukias zanpaktou Using his rebuttal aura Sherner attempted to slam Rukias Zanpaktou out of Averoniss hopefully off guard grasp and out of the hazy cloud giving Rukia a chance to retrieve it. Informing Rukia of the gem would have to wait until she was reequippedI know I did a lot of stuff in this post. If its an issue ill be happy to edit it.,Lasseireitei,ceeg5pc,1,t5_2wzsu
