Maybe keep kris an grip for top but thats about it. Aura shards fills its purpose better most of the time. Living death is amazing with survival of the fittest if you run enough tutors to get it consistently. Birthing pod is a good call in most every green deck so consider that one. Since teneb gets you their critters more wipes is always better. Try adding rout and damnation. I usually run about  or so wipes usually that many or more.

2544020,0,t1_cmqmts0,I guess Derevi can be classified as a resource denial deck pretty solidly. I played against one for several months and our group came to the conclusion that a Stasis Combo deck was probably the best. Its not exactly oppressive and Id throw it in a similar group as most UGx Prophet of Kruphix decks it either gets out of hand does nothing or accidentally combos six turns to late after its Prophet was exiled four times. Except in Derevi Stasis Hokori Winter Orb and Static Orb all act as extra Prophets essentially enabling the deck to take multiple turns in a row rather than take away your opponents turns. Basically it doesnt feel or play like a denial deck its closer to a time warpcombo deck in style even if not in cards. The guy who played that deck was a terrible deckbuilder though and tried to cut the stasis effects. Shame on him.On that line its entirely possible that your Druid player is better than mine I havent had a chance to judge his skill outside of the one deck but he seems competent enough.

3281547,0,t3_2xigrf,Whats your win condition? Just lock them out and ping them with Brago until they die?  Youve got Strionic Resonator which is an excellent win condition in multiplayer but may not be feasible in dual and dont really have anything to exploit with it. Normally you see a Blue Suns Zenith or Venser Shaper Savant to mill them for infinite or bounce all their permanents.  Some token generators would be a good choice to close out a win more quickly. Best of the bunch would be Master of Waves and Myr Battlesphere.Its hard for me to judge how fast you generate mana with this list. I run multiplayer and have access to Sol Ring Mana Vault etc so I always have access to high volumes of mana quickly and can safely slot some more expensive cards like Spine of IshSah and Exclusion Ritual.Due to the volume of mass removal in multiplayer there isnt much value in running Banisher Priest Fiend Hunter etc. Not sure if they are more viable in dual but Id definitely replace with removal that dont have exits clauses like Act of Authority and maybe even an Exclusion Ritual.Travelers cloak Steel of the Godhead etc can probably go.

Online I run against the most absurdly fast and oppressive decks in the format. The unspoken social contract in those games is that everyone is willing to do whatever is in their means to win. In that setting running combo decks that hit their pieces by TT every single game is totally fine. Playing full stax with all the lockdown and MLD is not only tolerated but expected. Theres no problem employing the most brutal tactics available because its what everyone is expecting and accepting.Offline at the LGS however I have a hard time finding people that want to play at that level. Therefore I leave the Brago lockdown deck at home and bring Chainer and Riku lists that are good at adapting to the level of whatever table Im sitting at.  For me if people are pissed off Im not going to have fun. People getting pissed off isnt so much a factor of the tactics being employed as it is a factor of what level of play people are expecting.

If youre just looking to play the Chain Veil game then go for it. If youre looking for consistent stax expand to more colors.gt The concern I have with doing these as stax builds is I already have DarettiDaretti is fun and competitive but isnt as powerful as Derevi or Brago for most metas. If youre partial to Daretti than hes a perfectly reasonable pick though.gt The other problem I think Ill have with Derevi is Im generally averse to attacking.Derevi only really attacks to run his engine and keep opponents locked down. I dont think Ive ever seen a Derevi win that wasnt by opponent concession when everyone agreed that they were unable to break free.gt Damia and Tasigur are probably fine speedwise. In that case theyre both solid picks. As I said they get better and better as the game progresses.gt Kruphix interests me but Ive never really looked into it.Hes really fun.

Forbid is good but not suitable for low curve spike decks that dont run green or heavy artifact ramp I see it as a huge vulnerability to play cards like Gilded Lotus Mental Misstep and Spell Snare arent bad if you play with many spike enemies I liked Dimir Charm and Izzet Charm due to their versatility but it turns  mana was kind of much as well as the limited power on the two so I cut them.If you really feel like you need even MORE counterspells then perhaps consider running the vanilla ones such as Counterspell and Mana Leak.

5331849,0,t1_cvt6cmi,I liked the sound of the exile mulligan because it creates a small disincentive to stuffing your deck full of tutors and tutoring for your one win condition which is currently the dominant strategy.   My reasoning is that in a  card deck  you wont be seeing a given card in the majority of games unless you tutor for it or draw your entire deck.   So it being exiled rather than shuffled in only matter if your deck is very focused around tutoring up that one card.  Providing some disencentive for allin combos like hermit druid would improve the format. After more thought  I dislike the exile mulligan a bit more because it is too gameable for decks with redundancy.   A narset deck could exile  cards searching for a hand that offers a turn  narset and still win off the other half of the deck. ,CompetitiveEDH,cvt7c5m,0,t5_2y62p

5508176,0,t3_3qip13,I mostly lurk here but I feel like this community is pretty instructive. A few of you might recognize me as the author of the sometimesmaligned  project and series of articles on Gathering Magic. In order to make sure a deck is built  and not just suboptimal it needs to be able to beat a competitive deck and that is where you guys come in. Seeing what youre playing helps me know whats out there that we need to be able to beat and I have a few competitive decks of my own that I bust out when Im at a table of sharks or someone is asking for it. Im particularly proud of my Maelstrom Wanderer deck that I only use if someone has it coming. Im  Im from Michigan and my wife and I are about to have our first child so Im pretty stoked to have someone to teach the game to in a decade or so if were still going strong by then. When Im not slinging cardboard Im an Amateur comedian and host of both the Brainstorm Brewery and Money Draught Magic podcasts. In addition to my series on Gathering Magic I also write a column for MTG Price that started as strict finance but has evolved into a column where were look at the financial implications of new printings reprintings and emerging EDH archetypes on the secondary market. Knowing whats Tier  in EDH has led to some very solid predictions and saved my readers a lot of money by helping them buy the cards they need before they spike in price based on the increasing demand. Luckily financiers dont understand EDH for the most part and leave the cards alone so its a lot more forgiving a market and price growth it based more in merit than hype. I started playing in  and I was the best player at my lunch table until I discovered competitive Magic in college and started grinding for about a decade. Ive been all over North America for this crazy childrens card game and basically the only Constructed I play now is EDH.

6618705,0,t3_469rhe,Hi! I play Ghave. This is my current list  ignore the maybeboard and sideboard maybe is cards that have been removed sideboard is cards that are on the tip of my mind that I might want to playtest.Combo turns generally start with untapping with either Ghave having cast him last turn or a critical amount of mana  creature tokens from beyond  awakening zone  aura mutation  Ghave that died that allows me to go off. The general thing to look for is Earthcraft  Fertile Ground  Wild Growth  Vorinclex off of Pattern of Rebirth maybe and try to resolve them with Ghave in play. Once this happens you should have enough mana to go for something that allows that to go infinite like Young wolf or Illusionists Bracers  Doubling season those  dont require the mana doubler they just require EarthCraft or Ashnods and finally you look for a wincon like Blood Artist  Blasting Station  Woodfall Primus or go to draw into those with skullclamp  smothering abomination. OR you see that everyone is tapped out and you have  mana  mana with vampiric tutor  with Dtutor to cast your tooth and nail.There is a lot of nuance to properly using your creature tutors for ramp VS saving them for combo and using your other tutors for answers VS using them for combo this just takes time and playtesting to master. Generally your early game is playing removal ramp and trying to resolve a Ghave. TIP if your meta has Gilded Drake  steal effects NEVER tap out for Ghave always leave  mana up to sac him to put him back in the command zone sometimes you need to so just do it.Feel free to ask me anything about Ghave.,CompetitiveEDH,d03xiya,4,t5_2y62p

In order to willfully limit yourself to a smaller card pool you need to have a compelling reason. You usually limit yourself to  colorssometimes  instead of  because of an easier mana base but if youre limiting your deckbuilding by cutting out  colors you need a really compelling reason.But mono blue is worse than multicolored for the same reason that mono red or mono black or mono green or mono white is worse. You lack variety of answers. You have limited ability to interact. You previously mentioned Karn and oblivion stone but those are  and  mana answers which are far worse than what you could get in other colors. Karn is much much worse than vindicate. Oblivion stone is worse than supreme verdict. In the same way that a monored deck needs an oppressively powerful general like Daretti to function a monoblue deck needs an oppressively powerful general to build around because monoblue is just not as good as UR UBR or WUB.,CompetitiveEDH,d05ggzd,1,t5_2y62p

6871307,0,t1_d0uqk16,Heres what he saidgt As for Prossh he costs  mana if you can get him down and you have food chain ad nauseum or a tutor for food chain of course you win. The key is that people cant consistently get prossh on the table turn  but Animar Hermit Druid do hit the board faster and consistently. If youre using tutors in this manner then you should just be playing c splintertwin or c hermit druid instead because theyre cheaper than having to cast a  mana commander with the metagame loaded with fast low curve decks designed perfectly to handle the rule change. Some people have caught onto that and play commanders like Zur or Grand Arbiter.  Paramount...gt gt I never said decks like prossh and sidisi couldnt win theyre still able to win games every time against bad decks and bad players. But thats just one other reason that Prossh is on the obsolete list. People compensate for Prosshs weaknesses by running tons of cards like Gutteral Response tons of removal and this is just clunky. Its also the sloppy way of trying to force the commander into a meta which if you try hard enough and your opponents dont have good decks then prossh definitely would succeed then.  ParamountLike uBiglupu said its actually interesting conversation. I personally run Prossh and see my removal suite at beneficial but I suppose I can see his point about it being clunky.

Still since you need to add a haste enabled I dont think it will be a crazy combo card. Same goes for most of the other decks it would be used in. Part of what makes Earthcraft good for comboing in decks like Ghave is that you can put a land doubler on a basic land and then make your guys double produce.

How are you coming up with the   TCG Prices MidLow? SCG? Channel Fireball? Your LGS? Add a list of what you currently have...seriouslyA description of your meta would not hurt either. Might help with budget suggestions specific card selection If I am assuming in that  is a decent mana base Khans Fetches maybe Zendikar fetches Shocks Filters Urborg a good tutor package Vampiric Demonic Mystical Personal Gamble Dark Petition Merchant Scroll your artifacts some Moxen Senseis Grim Monolith you can probably put the remaining core of the deck together for a decent budget. There are some expensive cards in this deck that in my opinion you will have to run but Candelabra ABUR Duals LED FoW Mana Drain and Crypt arent exactly necessary. Do they make the deck better? Absolutely yes.Im currently experimenting with a hybrid Waste Not Combo  traditional Storm DD list for largely budget reasons. However there is some overlap in cards being played and it might provide you with some ideas of what cards you can substitute for budget reasons ex. Demonic Consultation Waste Not Sleight of Hand etc.Side Note If you want to learn Grixis Storm watch some of Moxnixs videos. It actually helps learn the deck and what lines to take plus some of the games are pretty interesting to watch.Moxnix YT Channel ,CompetitiveEDH,d1t9nr2,3,t5_2y62p

You havent seen much Derevi havent you? If you have lethal on board you can cheat Elesh Norn in with Loyal Retainers. Derevi can get insane amounts of mana thats the idea of the deck.

7368115,0,t3_4g54aw,I have been paged and thus I appear!Not owning the big  cards Candel Twister Imp Grim arent really a big hindrance. It just means you have to think harder on your storm lines and might drop you a turn. Prioritizing upgrades as you move towards a T build for me generally comes down to what cards can I get the most utility out of. Until you have that tier   . deck completed you basically just have a deck with a lot of good stuff in it. If shes not firing on all cylinders you simply own a deck that can win.With that in mind I suggest picking up cards that you can run in both your Storm deck and any other deck you are currently running.. Land Base  Land is used everywhere. You can sleeve it into your storm and improve your turn speed significantly. You can move that land into any other deck and improve that deck. It goes everywhere. In every deck. Always! There is almost  reason if you plan on getting the fetches and ABURS to not work on getting it first. If by the time you finally get the money to move on the bigger cards for Storm maybe you dont like storm. Maybe you dont want to play it anymore. What can you take out of that to make something else? Land. Land. Land. Land. Land. . Mana Rocks!  Another card that goes everywhere. Storm relies on our mana base to go off. We are only as strong as our ability to get  mana as fast as possible. Get the basic ones that slot in almost every deck to maintain personal card value  Crypt  Vault  Monolith etc. . Combo Cards  Ok. Youve gotten some land and rocks in place your next step is combo cards. You dont need the best stuff in the deck if you just pulled your FutureTop combo. You can find these naturally with your basic wheels draw and adnaus style spells. While of course tutors will speed this up to usable levels depending on your playgroup you can probably do by slotting and waiting.. Tutors  Finally we get to tutors. The problem with putting tutors as upgrade slot  is that our deck FEASTS of tutors. We need them. We love them. We honestly cant have enough of them. They find what we need when we need it and allow us to actually do what we do  storm. However in my opinion as expressed above tutors have to come in th for very basic reasons. They dont go in every deck like LandRamp and if you have tutors but no wincon whats the point of having tutors?. Big Spells  Once youve completed the above youll have land ramp combos and tutors to find those combos. Heres where you can slot the rest of the cards. A lot of these big spells facilitate our deck but when it comes to winning games theyre the Irving to Storms Lebron. You want them. They constantly make the other better but if you have to pick one of them youre taking the King. You can easily replace the Big  see above with arcane denial  fellwarstone  Drowned catacomb personal tutor.You can further replace Mana Drain with Delay. Its not a perfect replacement as you really want the mana from Drain but if you need a  slot counterspell replacement delay gets the job done to protect yourself and add another storm on the stack. In regards to your deck directly uTheLibertinistic did a good job of a breakdown. Drop the rocks that dont pay for themselves Id drop any lands that come in tapped fetches or no you dont have a lot worth fetching and youd just be better off running an extra basic. Add Tidespout combo to make up for your land base and ensure youre running every tutor in blackred you can even the higher cost bad ones are worth an early slot to be replaced later Im looking at you Increasing Ambition . It will be pulled out early and often as it can hit you hard off adnaus or sit dead for some turns but your decks curve and reliability looks like you maybe have a turn or two when you could actually hard cast this. Add some cheap helper cards to make up for your curve. Goblin Electromancer is a card I swear by in storm and one of the keys that separates my deck from Moxnixs. For a  drop if it sticks it will certainly help make up for the higher cost of your midvalue cards as you upgrade. Make it stick the turn beforeon the one you adnaus on and watch it save you dozens of mana and ease your line difficulty up.,CompetitiveEDH,d2fpcbi,5,t5_2y62p

Karador just seems meh if you draw him early game and if youve made it to late game hopefully youre winning!I think voice could be good in a control heavy meta but I definitely think its not a shoe in. It needs testing. Remember that in most cEDH games people are trying to win faster than you can so theyre not actively trying to stop you. You NEED to consistently stop them EARLY. In a control mirror this list probably wont do great because it lacks blue but that could be okay  most decks fold to something.As for GSV and Chord I say run them both.

However one of the main reasons why the debates get so heated about the EDH RCs actions is because their rules and policy are what WOTC supports as the Official and is the most visible set of rules that we all generally follow in competitivetournament environments.  If the cEDH community comes up with a viable Tournament EDH variant that takes off in popularity and becomes successful I could see Wizards taking notice and offering support in an official capacity.

7921516,0,t1_d46bgyt,Yeah the Coffers being too slow I can see that. If you did go for more of the combowin route I would definitely put that back in as you may need a bunch of mana on a turn with winters orb in play. As for whether the combo is better or not I really dont think I can say. I would bet to say in a blind meta having  win combos is better. Thats not to say your list isnt better for your meta though and as you have said you are already winning a fair amount of games. If I were making this deck in my meta a couple combo finishers that work in the stax hell Im creating would be strictly better I know this as Ive tried both ways in both my Grand Arbiter and Anowon decks. I agree that flipping Lili becomes a bit trickier without the recurring fodder but I think in the combowin version Lili is just another stax piece needed to stall until I can win with my own game plan rather than a core piece of denial needed for my game plan to succeed. Again though if you are sticking with the small creaturesdrainbleed them out plan I think youll want that Bloodghast.To answer your question in my experience most stax decks do try to win first with a combo of some sorts. Swinging with creatures or in some case voltron is the secondary win condition.Also Liliana flips on nontoken death so I dont think sacrificing a Bitterblossom token will get you there although BItterblossom in a stax hell can win the game so Im not arguing you exclude it especially if attacking with s in a world where no one can cast anything is your wincon.,CompetitiveEDH,d46gbto,1,t5_2y62p

7971914,0,t3_4ofiqu,Well the biggest issues are that it has to either be cast on the same turn as Sharuum or survive a round without being removed and that it isnt very useful outside of the combo where Metamorph and Sculpting Steel are.,CompetitiveEDH,d4c49x2,1,t5_2y62p
7978156,0,t1_d4cibuy,Also while Im at it I realize there is a cost in consistency for running a C deck as well as restrictions on lands and mana sources you need faster colored mana and cant run as many utility lands so what am I gaining from playing red and blue through Child of Alara versus Karador for say. Goblin Bombardment seems like a very good sac outlet and acts as a decent wincon Avalanche Riders is a nice  CMC version of Acidic Slime and acts as a semi wincon while Murderous Redcap  sac outlet and Mikaeus go infinite and it also works with Reveillark and Friends. Intuition seems like a great card to setup an infinite loop Body Double  Reveillark  Karmic Guide  Phyrexian Delver from Intuition all can get the others from the grave given time and go infinite with a sac outlet. Body Double itself seems to be another reason to play blue. Phantasmal Image can be brought back from the grave with Sun Titan and can loop in some situations. Mystical Tutor and Wargate both tutor for useful pieces either sac outlets lands or reanimate spells. But is it enough to warrant using a less synergistic Commander than Karador and playing a less consistent mana base?

Also with not enough discard cards can slip through the cracks and you havent got enough discard which is also true of counterspells. The issue with both is that they have to be quit powerful else its not worth the  for  in a multiplayer game. All in all discard usually hits more stuff is cheaper and is less liable to get countered but on the downside its usually sorcery speed. Both trade card advantage unfavourably so you only see the best of the best like mana drain FoW and Thoughtsieze.,CompetitiveEDH,d5imjwm,0,t5_2y62p

8724737,0,t3_4zg6oc,You should be removing all your high cmc spells and creatures that dont contribute to the plan of oppressing your opponents or ending the game on the spot.   Things like tooth and nail and avenger of zendikar are the most obvious offenders.  they cost too much and you will not be ending the game with either in your list.   Natural order is similar.  You dont run vorinclex or craterhoof behemoth so really... what are you tutoring for with Natural order?  You actually have too much removal.  You could cut down to  board wipes  cmc or less ideally and  instant speed removals.  As others have said dorks are key.  They can be clamped sacd and recured easily.  Cheap cmc free sac outlets are mandatory so look at carrion feeder viscera seer and the altars.  Oppression mindslicer and contamination are your main stax elements that stop your opponents from functioning normally.   Smokestack grave pact dictate of erebos along with token generators like awakening zone and bitterblossom are your engine for keeping peoples board states oppressed while racking up the xp for meren. Now for win cons.  Being that you want this to be a competitive list your most efficient way to win is off a combo.   You already have mikeaus and woodfall primus so pick up a triskillion.   If you have a triskellion you should also be looking at necrotic ooze and phyrexian devourer.  Throw in buried alive so you can tutor for the entire combo.

8821503,0,t3_50wspc,Hey!  Thanks for the shout out.  Pox Tribal is my favorite Your list is well on its way Phkors Im jealous of your high end tutors.  Have you playtested much?  The experience you have in your meta will likely give better clues on how to tune the deck.  For starters though you are a little light on stax effects and heavy on discard I feel.  Discard eventually stops working so you dont have to dedicate too many slots to it.  Griiver is right to suggest Winter Orb and Static Orband Tangle Wire because this type of deck really wants redundant ways of keeping your opponents off of mana preventing them from advancing their board state while you strip their hand away with LiliNecrogen Mist effects.  It sounds silly but sometimes Contamination just isnt enough P  Running a high density of mana rocks helps to accelerate your game and play through Winter Orb The beauty of this type of deck is that it can operate on low mana.  Lilis ability doesnt need it. The taxers Sphere of Resistance have been pretty good for me because it throws off the early game curve but theyre a pretty sad late game draw.  Trinisphere however is worth consideration because of how it affects things like Force of Will Narset Maelstrom Wanderer etc.  A T Trinisphere is a very strong opening in this type of deck Llanowar Elf at cmc for lulz...If you run Lili in the Command Zone definitely consider Blood Pet and Soldevi Adnate for early enablers.  Slum Reaper is too slow and competes with Smokestack at cmc.  Senseis Divining Top Entomb and Chrome Mox deserve to be in your list I might even play Fellwar Stone and Grim Monolith.  Dont ignore instant speed spot removal Dismember Snuff Out Go for the Throat and things like Pithing Needle and Phyrexian Revoker.  Defense Grid is good if you need more Azami hate.  Nether Traitor for sure over the cockroaches because its a lot less mana to return to play. You might like Lake of the Deadwe do! but Expedition Map is slow and not needed here.  I agree with Griiver that Helm  Leyline isnt the best gameplan and is definitely a metacall.  In general your primary plan should be to lock out your opponents which will make it difficult to find space for flashy interactionscombos Geths Grimoire  Words of Waste.  Necrotic Ooze combo is probably the best weapon of choice if you need one though being fast and difficult to interact with.My Sidisi list has moved away from Pox Tribal and plays more similarly to Big Mana Black ramping heavy mana artifacts to play through Winter Orb and multiple Sidisi castings into Rings  Basalt  Exsanguinate combo.  Its been the strongest and most resilient iteration of my Mono B Stax project but really Im just waiting for the banhammer to be lifted off of Braids.  The difficulty for Pox Tribal is its lack adequate redundancy to SmokestackBraids.  Griiver and I found it unfavorable in the past but some Nath lists have been successful with Possessed Portal.  Granted they get to play Gaeas Cradle lol.,CompetitiveEDH,d78823r,2,t5_2y62p

For example armageddon you kinda have to make sure you suffer the least and you have way to break parity eg. dorks artifact. However for symmetrical hug effects no one really need to prepare anything for it and most of the time they can reap benefit before you. You are trying to mitigate the hug for others by using stax piece but I think at this point it would be better to just run stax without the hug.

9724693,0,t1_dabjazx,I really dont want to come off as rude so I apologize in advance if I do. Necropotence is one of the best cards in EDH it gets around some hate bears like LeoSpirit allows you to refill your hand at pretty much all points in the game. Maybe not having a good mana base in  colors is relevant to not being able to cast it played Jeleva for a while without any duels and had no problem casting it but your running bubbling muckcropsylvan so getting an urborg should be a high priority for you. It costs three so you should almost never cascade into it and its no worse than drawing a land off a wheel and youre playing more lands than other storm decks in the format. If youre struggling for mana I would for sure not play reliquary. Beseech is a really bad version of grim tutor. And if youre already having a hard time with triple black then it seems like youll be casting this card for  manaat that point its just a worse diabolic tutor which is a very bad place to be. Squandered resources can work but you need to run more get lands into play cards for it to be efficient otherwise youre paying two colored mana for three or four mana and you have no lands in the end. It just looks far more dangerous to any possible recovery than it does securing a win. Hurkyls is as much for targeting yourself as it is for others. Its a mana ritual or removal. Card is just fantastic.Collective brutality is like the ultimate  for  but if its working in your meta than I guess keep playing it but I would be extremely critical of its merits while you test it. Minds desire is better than Aetherflux Reservoir by a long shot. Aethflux is a four mana investment that does nothing when you play it and only becomes effective once you start chaining spells together after. Since you have no way of returning your own artifacts outside of chain I wouldnt run it. Minds desire however is an extremely hard to counter win condition that should be flipping  of your cards into play. Think about drawing  cards off of a wheelthief but instead you get to cast them for free. Though as I mentioned before it may be less effective for you since youre running so many lands.,CompetitiveEDH,dabs506,5,t5_2y62p

Most times I think youll find that disruption on small things like stifling a Cloud of Faeries etb trigger when it means that a player has to stay tapped out hold this title rather than huge splashy things like whether a Rite of Replication resolves.I find that this gets people in the mindset of thinking how these small things add up during the game which in turn leads them to building their deck so its more capable of interacting at those key moments.,CompetitiveEDH,danj1od,3,t5_2y62p

It may be the best colorless green card out there!Green also provides great creaturebased ramp including all the CMC dorks you mentioned plus Birds Elves of Deep Shadow and Avacyns Pilgrim.  There are a couple other nonstaple ones too which most decks should at least consider Lotus Cobra Bloom Tender and maybe Wood Elves.Green Tutors are usually creatureoriented and youve covered most of them save Fauna Shaman. Fierce Empath is waaay more situational but has a spot in some decks.Finally I think most of the artifactenchant hate is covered but Caustic Caterpillar and Ainok Survivslist are quality niche options for working independent of their ETB which is something good stax decks are able to shut off.

That being said Firestorm really wasnt the key to that synergy... the same could have been done with a number of other discard mechanics minus killing a creature with  toughness. Additionally that burn came at the expense of  cards. Ultimately I think it really depends on your deck style how much fuel you have for Firestorm to weigh if the card disadvantage is worth it.

10555719,0,t1_dd4jcbz,Saying that Teferi can be a dedicated tide deck was definitely a misnomer on my part.  I understand the distinction between the archetypes well and I should have definitely chosen my words more carefully.  When I said that a budget list should lean harder on high tide I did not mean that it should do so in the same way JVP does. Tide combo only exists with JVP as the general because of the double tide and no other deck including Teferi can fill that niche. What I meant is that in a budget list should get the mana for the chain veil combo through casting high tide and not through artifact mana since a lot of the cheaper money wise rocks that tap for  are way too slow.You are correct in your evaluation on sculptor. The only reason Im suggesting it is because Im operating on the assumption that the OP is working with a very tight budget with a lot of open slots. It is by no means ideal but it is better than some of the cards that are currently in his list even if only used as reshape fodder. I have ran sculptor without future sight in my full power Teferi list to test it out and while its obviously not good enough to make the cut ther its definitely playable in a correct context and meta.My apprehension towards sculpting steelmetamorph loops back to my belief that a budget deck should lean heavier on high tide. Copying a dynamolotus with metalmorph is a pretty inefficient way to use your mana for a relatively small gain. If you are making budget concessions then most of you rocks are not going to be mana neutral thats just the fact that you have to accept when building this deck. Plus with CA and Metalmorph being  each Id say that getting a Mana Vault would be a better investment for OP.,CompetitiveEDH,dd4lymv,1,t5_2y62p

T ramp has also been a problem with this deck because outside of the exploration effects and mana rocks I dont have too many things to play this is also due to the fact that I am sometimes looking to play a t damnation because I am behind. Pernicious deed is in the deck because a friend of mine plays Muzzio and I had no clue how to interact with everything he was doing but I think that can come out to increase my speed.What about a card like Chrome Mox? it exiles something which does not feel great but is this type of  for  mana acceleration worth it in a combo deck?

10650819,0,t1_ddedhx0,This is just conjecture and I am not an experienced coder but maybe there is a way to analyze win rate percentages?  Decks that post really high totals in general with additional data within specifically designated games.  ex. Lets say a DD Zur list has an  win rate overall with a  win rate within games explicitly marked competitive. This separates a Voltron Zur list that has a  win rate overall but only a  competitive win rate as a more casual build despite being a traditionally competitive commander.     There might be some formula that sorts decks based on win rate as approaching  overall with the consideration of approaching  in certain settings.,CompetitiveEDH,ddejt3w,3,t5_2y62p

10794660,0,t3_5ue58a,VoltronEquipment strategies arent usually very good in competitive EDH because you can only eliminate one player at a time whereas the combo and stax decks kill or lock out the entire table at once. That being said if you want to make this deck as strong as possible drop all the expensive stuff and add more mana rocks. Mana efficiency is the most important limiting factor for any competitive strategy and your average CMC should be around  at most if you want to keep up. As a guideline everything above  mana has to strongly improve your chance of winning. Everything  mana and up should end the game immediately. With that in mind go through your deck and cut everything that doesnt make the grade. If you then replace these cards with cheap mana rocks and more efficient cards your deck will be stronger overall. Hellkite Tyrant is a pretty epic card but it doesnt really help you when you could simply be beating people to death with Akiri before you even get to  mana. Another point which is specific to voltron strategies Tutors arent going to be very good for you. Your strategy is to buff up Akiri with lots of artifacts and equipment and beat people to death  if you want to have a chance you need to do it fast. No equipment is so much better than the other options that the extra mana you spend with a Fabricate or Whir of Invention is worth it. For any other strategy not playing tutors is blasphemy but youre already handicapping yourself by focusing on combat damage so you need to be as fast as possible. TLDR To keep up with competitive decks make sure you are really fucking fast.,CompetitiveEDH,ddte51j,24,t5_2y62p
10802925,0,t1_ddu7d45,Its good but Im not sure its great. Isochron is incredible because it and dramatic reversal are  mana muddle less than  mana tezzeret and its reasonable to pull out with Transmute Artifact in the early game. Adding paradox engine to the mix means you need  mana to cast isochron a card to imprint  to cast paradox engine and  to activate isochron. On top of that you still need a sink.Paradox Engine is for sure incredible by itself but if we are getting into the  mana range there are other options for redundancy including basaltrings.Edit if I built around it I could probably put something together thats better than using PE as a backup for a flubbed isochron but I dont know if it would be better than what Ive got now.,CompetitiveEDH,ddu8uhe,1,t5_2y62p
