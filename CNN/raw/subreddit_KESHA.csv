124597,0,t1_cehea5x,Rarely are serious disorders like this something you are driven to.  Usually you are your own worst enemy in things like addiction and eating disorders and while you can remove and negate outside influences to promote positive environments... Many times you are your own worst enemy.You will believe no matter what others tell you that you deserve this monkey this terrible thing you are cursed with. Even as it hurts you and harms you you think it does some good. At least Im not sad at least Im not alone at least Im not fat. And many times its not even as basic as I drink to feel happy or I binge and purge to feel skinny.If these issues were as simple as that wed have been able to talk ourselves out of this nonsense a thousand years ago.,KESHA,cesmbuz,3,t5_2rgxk
