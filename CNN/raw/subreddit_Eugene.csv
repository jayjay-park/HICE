637476,0,t1_cgcn0wv,Sorry to interrupt your discussion but I wanted to ask you something since you are a business owner.How would you identify someone that knew Java.  What abilities or level of understanding qualifies someone as knowing Java apart from someone that can make a simple calculator program like Windows Calc? Technically they know Java but have probably never touched enterprise level programs. My reason for asking is I am trying to move to Enterprise level development but gaining that initial experience is difficult at best. I develop enduser programs but when trying to enhance skills in project management and team based development its impossible since I am only  person. How would you recommend getting your foot in the door on larger development teams when most of them require teambased experience to begin with?Cheers!,Eugene,cgcqcna,2,t5_2qp4p

The median house price is rising slightly the rents are rising slightly but thats offset by the massive amount of sec  housing in here.

Its like telling an Indian they dont understand genocide.You just dont know the basic definition of gentrification. Its a word it has a meaning and you dont know it. Gentrification does not require an area to be a slum despite what you think.

There are bad guys out there with guns so if it is purely about protecting them lets kick out the jams!Im sure you dont actually need to be told why police dont drive around in tanks. gt The fact of the matter is that regular cops dont need this stuff to pull over a speeder or to pick up a shoplifter.Regular cops are killed responding to entirely regular calls.gt But what if the person they pulled over is crazy on PCP?!That happens.gt Equip for the most likely situation.The most likely situation is they will not need their gun their tazer their OC spray their baton their bullet vest or any backup. But since we are giving them the tools necessary for situations that arent the most likely maybe we can go ahead and let them have different tools for different situations. We have seen what happens when police are outgunned and the results are absolutely devastating.gt If a carbide like an M is the best tool for the job have the cops turn in their side arms and sling a rifle.Because if its REALLY necessary why wouldnt they want to use them all the time amiright?! Just like how I use a butchers knife to butter my bread! Oh wait because they have different purposes and you already know that. Just a useless tidbit here but my husband actually carried an M and a sidearm while deployed. Shocking I know.gt We have a military and very clear laws as to when they can be used at home. The boys in blue dont need that hardware.And police arent fulfilling the role of military.

It was a good friend of mines birthday the other day and we spent the day together hanging out. It was nice out so we walked around the Rose Garden still underwhelming at this time of year walked around Skinners Butte chatted with some people we saw then went and checked out the Maude Kerns little museum on campus. Then we just walked around that area of campus lots of cool little houses tucked around there got some Sweet Life and ended up at Bierstein for dinner and birthday drinks I know you arent drinkers but if you like beer at all they will have something for you! also their food is great.The exhibit at Maude Kerns right now is very macabre just to give you a heads up. My point is you dont have to do anything crazy you can just walk around Hendricks park or go to the Raptor Center or the planearium. Throw in a nice lunch at one of our many awesome food trucks then a nicer dinner at Belly or some shit and Im sure you will have an excellent day.Cheers!,Eugene,cp59h3u,5,t5_2qp4p

5005721,0,t1_cupc2ax,gt IMO its the responsibility of the people that currently hold power mostly men to take steps to correct the issue. This I agree with.gt Steps that include a hard introspective look on male culture and what it teaches young men and women.While I think this would be a very good thing I dont think it really has all that much to do with the people in power. Just because the people in power are men does not mean that it necessarily follows that men in general have power. Men are overrepresented at nearly all extremes of society. They are the people most likely to be politicians or CEOs but also most likely to be homeless denied access to their children in prison or the victims of violence. Every voting adult is equally responsible for the current state of things. Singling out male children for special education is just going to further stigmatize men. Its not the correct approach. We already treat boys as if they were defective girls in many schools holding up default female behavior as an ideal denying boys outlets for their natural healthy urges and failing to adapt instruction to their unique ways of learning. Boys are significantly behind girls at every stage of our education system because we keep asking boys to change to fit society rather than building a society that works for all of us in the first place.,Eugene,cupdlu8,1,t5_2qp4p

5055742,0,t1_cuuvs2u,This tech is evolving no matter what the minimum wage is set at. We could lower back down to  and we would still be looking at this. Beyond that youre oversimplifying and dumbing down a much larger issue. Were not talking about McDonalds workers. Were talking about every worker that makes minimum wage. Cooks dishwashers housekeepers gas station workers customer service workers janitors retail workers and the list goes on. Should these people have worked harder when they were younger to develop better skills? Maybe I dont know its my business to judge that but I get a lot of you feel it is yours. Regardless the minimum is currently the wage that millions of adult Americans with families are now stuck with. And tax payers have to now subsidize that minimum wage with hundreds of millions of dollars in food stamps and medical benefits because these full time workers dont make enough to feed themselves and go to the doctor for regular check ups. Some small businesses may struggle with this but I think that if you do not own a business that can afford to pay a true living wage than either your business model is a failure and you should go out of business or that you are not doing enough of the work yourself and are just relying on cheap labor so you can just sit back and collect the profits. No sympathy for either of those scenarios here.,Eugene,cuvepdj,7,t5_2qp4p

5247617,0,t1_cvihx8i,gt But certainly if someone were to ingest enough pure THC for example it would eventually kill that person even if only because it would eventually dilute essential compounds in the bloodstream just like water can do if you drink an extremely large amount of it all at once.This is totally besides the point and pretty smart alecy. Everyone knows that if you replace enough of your body with nonbody material that you will die. This is like saying that fresh concrete has a relatively low LD because if you inject even just a tiny amount intravenously  that you will die. Technically true. But its still a smartalecy thing to proclaim.When we are talking about overdosing and LDs the context is an acute fatal physiological reaction to the substance.

7986638,0,t1_d4dowt1,Well were not that much of a city and its only an hour drive from Oakridge. Do you get reimbursed for housing? The only reason I suggest Oakridge is that the market is really hot here right now. Not only is it expensive but finding a place is a full time job because landlords can be really picky due to demand. Also if youre going to be here for  months that might get rough because our rental market is built around the university and most places will not give a lease that ends in the middle of the school year they really want to lease July through July so that they have time to get incoming students when a lease expires. That said you could probably find a sublet for the summer pretty easily because many students go home but their lease isnt up until the end of summer. But if youre looking for  months Im not sure what youd do when the sublet ended. Getting a month to month lease in this town can be hard. ,Eugene,d4drvht,2,t5_2qp4p
