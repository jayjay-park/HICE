2429638,0,t1_cmbzdqd,Last update was  months ago that broke a lot of stuff.  If youre too busy to work on it it still appears to be abandoned.  End result is the same  wasted potential.  ,baconit,cmc0dml,3,t5_2rfk9

2751414,0,t1_cngt2m1,Yup if IE detects such ad to an app of WP it will automatically take you to the Store. The programmer behind the ad is probably doing it on purpose though. Most ads dont act like a direct link.,baconit,cngtotr,2,t5_2rfk9

3773940,0,t3_33moap,kaspins answered the question.Why someone took a screenshot and posted here or what on earth this subreddit is... I have no idea what is going on.It is a popup I added recently due to popularity and people looking to get in contact. Could have made it more user friendly but that is one of those next version things no longer have a flash compiler to update app. The app should load after clicking OK although I have never tested it on a mobile Again flash based.,baconit,cqmgglc,2,t5_2rfk9
