10471198,0,t3_5pxpyz,As some people know already Ive been involved in the ski industry in some shape or form since . Theres quite a markup on that stuff as well. I used to work for Rossignol for the past several years and basically all I would do is go around to the many ski resorts on the east coast and promote their brand. I would be decked out head to toe in all the last gear and simply hand out freebies to the guests while sharing a ride on the lift or in other places at the resort. For the last several years Ive teamed up with Salomon and do the same thing. One of my rewards is to be able to buy things at wholesale. So heres a look at the wholesale to retail markup for ski products. I also get a pro deal on Smartwool socks. Have a look...  So the markup is quite  a bit. A lot really. But when it comes to darts these American companies are totally putting it to us. And yes they do have an agreement of sorts. Its called MAP pricing which is controlled by Darts World and AZ Darts. THEY dictate the prices for all these shops in order to maintain a level playing field. At no time would it ever stop anyone from branching out on their own and buying direct from Pure Darts or Darts Corner wholesale and throwing a monkey wrench into the system. But yes I would say this is total a total rip off. Sure make some money but dont bend me over and go in dry. I think  is reasonable. But   amp  is pure bullshit. Another major problem is that the high majority of US players have NO IDEA about these UK shops. Just the other day some dude was bragging how he got Monster darts on sale for  marked down from . Happy as fuck this dude. Looking back at it now I wish I would have gone about it a bit nicer but I pointed out that these darts cost  shipped from the UK. Immediately he thought this was a new markdown price as he bought his a couple years ago. Anyway it was pretty much total disbelief that the darts were so cheap. He had NO fucking idea. That is the perfect example of the average US dart player. Personally I think darts in the USA would be MUCH more popular if darts were prices reasonably.  dollars for  tungsten darts is just too much. That keeps beginners away imo. Lower the prices and make up for it with increased sales is the way to go.  ,DartsTalk,dcv0nmb,1,t5_3ic2s
10498072,0,t1_dcy0pur,Also in regards to your estimate of millions of darts players in the U.S. if you asked me how many dart boards have been sold over the last ten years in the U.S. sure Id be willing to guess a few million.   million households in the U.S. it wouldnt be unreasonable to think  in  would have a board up in their house.  But how many actually use it know how to play or own something other than the darts it came with or brassies bought at walmart.  And when I say know to play Im not even talking about know how to play well. Know their outs etc.  Im talking about youre walking down the street and Joe Schmo is cleaning out his garage.  You notice a dartboard hanging up and challenge him to a game of .  Would he even know what the hell youre talking about?,DartsTalk,dcy2f9m,1,t5_3ic2s
10635287,0,t1_ddbu9x1,LOL I would be happy if we only had  tax to pay but zero tax would be even better!  We get taxed like crazy on everything I swear they will be taxing the air soon.,DartsTalk,ddcy5qn,1,t5_3ic2s
10757994,0,t1_ddplk0q,Being on the east coast you REALLY need to start making Darts Corner your friend. Buying darts amp supplies overseas is like getting the stuff for free when compared to US prices. ,DartsTalk,ddplv08,1,t5_3ic2s
10829686,0,t1_ddwzpdt,Heres my biggest gripe. You saw the prototype WWD darts right? Those would cost me . per piece to manufacture. X to make a set. So a little over  per set. Add in a point protector and maybe a cheap set of stems  shipping to get them to me. Maybe  or so depending on how many sets I had made. No matter how many models I had made I would never be able to get them into US shops for a reasonable price. Almost the same situation as Accurate Darts. They started  selling retail in US shops last year but guess what?  price tag Nobody not me you or anyone would be able to duplicate what Showtime Darts has done in the UK. The wholesalers in the USA simply WILL NOT allow it. God forbid you get quality darts made for  set and sell them for . It simply isnt going to happen. Then these thieves run around playing all high and mighty and try to pass off what they do as legit and say they look out for their fellow dart players. Hiding behind MAP pricing price fixing and calling it a day. Total BS. We could offer some incredible prices here in the states. Most likely with  certainty it would give a jump start to the sporthobby of darts that we desperately need. Id buy darts in the USA if they offered fair prices. Im sure all of us would. But until then Ill keep trying to point potential dart buyers towards otherbetter choices.  ,DartsTalk,ddx07vm,1,t5_3ic2s
11261380,0,t3_60qh7c,I see so many discussions about  remaining. Page after fucking page with a shitload of people that go s with their first dart. If the opponent is way back in the s then have at it. Go whatever way you want. But for the love of god do not go s if the opponent is sitting pretty. You will loseAnd ya know what kills me. Its mostly Americans that go this way because they feel confident on s because of cricket. ,DartsTalk,df8glj5,2,t5_3ic2s
