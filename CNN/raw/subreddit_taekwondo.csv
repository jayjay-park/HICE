196748,0,t1_cf0uf7n,Are there? Well.... All I know is Im ITF. I live in New Zealand but we are the one that started in Canada by Gen Choi. My step dad who is recently th Dan also my instructor has an encyclopedia. He trains hard man TKD is his life. Funny enough they havent updated the new logo on the website. Not sure whats going on. I still got the standard logo on my do bok but the new students have the new one. Obviously we still got the rights to use it a little longer or something has. Hanged. The logo thing has been debated between the federations for a long time apparently. Ill give you some links so you can decide what Im under. As far as Im aware Im under the original Gen Choi one and we follow his standards his teachings.  think this is the national site with our logo on its the international logo thats been changed,taekwondo,cf0uo0c,2,t5_2r3yo
269969,0,t3_1wwufr,I do this feedback drill which can be done anywhere so practice as much as you can with every one of my students because almost EVERYONE has trouble spinning forward or backward when they first start spinning. I find its usually caused by flexing ones abs curling forward at the onset of the spinstart in a normal sparring stance. Stand up straight with slightly more weight on your back leg. Note the spot on the floor where your back foot isusing your shoulders to generate momentum try to spin backwards as though you are starting a back kick or spinning hook kick by lifting your back foot off the floor and rotating on your front foot. The goal is to get your back foot to the EXACT position where it started.Im willing to bet you will end up with your back foot ahead of your front foot because you flexed forward at the start and threw yourself off balance. Pretty much the only way you will be able to complete the spin is if you remain upright so its a nice feedback mechanism. One note if you just cant seem to get it you need to lean not flex slightly forward toward your imaginary target as your weight transfers to your front foot and then almost immediately lean away from the target in midspin basically lean forward when your back is toward your target.,taekwondo,cf8qqr4,2,t5_2r3yo

484039,0,t1_cfv8l9j,Which part? Im confused. In my school the instructor has relocated wed basically beat the snot out of each other sparring kicks to the body could be solid and you could pop someone really good in the head but youre not trying to take their head off. The school was in TN at the time. The tournament was in Atlanta back in  if I recall correctly I was a junior belt match I was  though. Both my opponent and I were Gup. He pissed me off really bad by literally dancing outside of my range then trying to jump in and kick. I complained to the ref that this wasnt sporting but he said just fight him. So I feinted a couple of times like I was going to kick as he came in. Then as he did come in I landed a REALLY hard hook kick with my heel straight into his face. He broke his nose collapsed and blood went everywhere. I was disqualified for not using control to the headface. ,taekwondo,cfvaedj,1,t5_2r3yo

999332,0,t3_25b7md,Im seeing some good commentary in this thread and would like to add my own .. TaekwonDo is a very straight forward martial art and is used for self defense. The core techniques are relatively simple and usually direct. Think Get in stick em and get out. This is in contrast to something like Capoiera or KungFu which are both rely on elaborate movement and deception to maximize effectiveness in specific situations. So what does that mean for you? Well TaekwonDo is good for ending a fight quickly and decisivelyin self defense. Like many others have said you could go to a bad school or a good school. There are plenty of bad schools so shop around. Martial arts schools are like bikes or anything else in life. Find the one that fits you. If youre looking for things to measure a school by I would say look at the class structure and schedule and then visit the classes. Most schools welcome potential students to come and watch. I just got back from a trip to Korea for TKD and I met very talented martial artists who had attended schools for most of their lives and then switched so dont feel like you cant do that as well. Good luck and have fun!,taekwondo,chhvr31,3,t5_2r3yo
1114716,0,t3_26nubl,th gup here. During testing we are only required to know our actual testing form and all offensive and defensive techniques for our level. Red belts testing for black must know all forms and the black belts should know and have an understanding of all forms as well. Ive witnessed master stop for a moment and tell the black belts that they get to start with Chonji.Anything below red belt is only the current levels form. However master and the other high black belts are strict on precision and will fail you if you are not displaying proper technique control and precision. I have never seen this happen but have been told this has occurred in the past. My master wont allow them to test if they are not ready however.For my upcoming testing for th gup I am recommended to knowThe  tenats of TaekwondoThe meaning of my current belt and my new beltTae Geuk   The whole form and its meaning along with the correct movements associated with the form. No count. Should also know the number of movements.Tae Geuk   Must remember the meaning. Testing on the form has already occurred and my master does not expect us to test on it during our low color levels. He does expect us to know it however.Must know the offensive and defensive techniques for my level and be able to perform them backtoback on both sides until the masters are certain you have demonstrated a thorough understanding of your forms moveset. I am happy to admit that I have never needed to do any form or technique over.Must be able to display an understanding of basic and for level advanced techniques during multiple sparring matches against generally higher ranked opponents. Threeway sparring occurs at blue belt and up. Unspoken during this time are the tenats. If you lack selfcontrol during sparring you will be warned and if it continues removed.I would go into detail for Black Belt testing requirements but this post is long enough lol,taekwondo,chv036s,1,t5_2r3yo

2836406,0,t3_2shxm7,I just wanted to say go for it! Make sure you get the experience. As a person who is by no means a great competition fighter I want to tell you that Ive learnt far more from the fights Ive lost than the ones Ive won. I too do ITF and a few important lessons Ive learnt are  stay relaxed and loose when you are not engaging but keep moving. In the first round tease your opponent make them try and throw attacks but miss. Take note of what legs and attacks they favour. One very common attack other than the turning kick is a fast sliding side kick. These are hard to see coming. Or they will hold a side kick and pump kick at you and simply tap you on the head. but if you keep an Ltype stance with your front arm around chest height  you can do whats termed jamming. Essentially you keep your arm rigid their kick hits it and soon as their foot touches the ground you fly in with a superman punch. Very easy scoring. Another thing you may encounter in ITF style sparring is what is termed rushing. This is when your opponent tries to rush you out of the ring with constant punches to the face. Be ready for this. In this situation there are two main strategies . If they force you out of the ring give them a good back kick to the guts. Your two points are valuable after a flurry of punches  usually only one point is awarded for a set of rush punches as they are crappy but if they get you out of the ring its a foul.  . You can simply slide to the side whilst doing a turning kick using their forward momentum to give them a good sting. This is termed finishing.   And as a bit of extra advice always have a few combos up your sleeve that you know well enough to do without thinking. For example fake middle turning to get their guard down high turning to get the points. One of my favourites is to drive my opponent backward with an axe kick then throw all of my body weight forward into punches to the head. Be aware they usually only work once.   Sorry about the info overload but knowing specific itf style strategies is helpful especially due to the huge contrast between the sparring styles in ITF and WTF. Any further questions feel free to ask . ,taekwondo,cnqhv11,1,t5_2r3yo

4918485,0,t3_3i8m27,Let me provide a counter thought to a lot of the ones that are being posted here. While its not necessarily appropriate for TKD there are some styles where there is practically no chambering at all. Instead of performing a strike and immediately rechambering said strike you go straight into the next strikemotion from whatever position you were in. In a very linear style like with a lot of kicking like TKD rechambering makes more sense. TKD is a long to medium distance art and maintaining distance is an important part of that. We fully commit to an attack but then often immediately make distance  rechambering is part of this process.In other styles where everything is done from a short distance this completely changes the game. American Kenpo is all about performing quick multistrikes from a very short distance your body typically ends up no more than  inches from your opponent if even that far. In a style like this there is no time for chambering if youre going to get to the next movementstrike you have to move from whatever position that last movement ended at.,taekwondo,cueiho8,2,t5_2r3yo

By using light contact and even no head contact for kids you can teach them all the skills but still keep them safe. And nearly every sport program on the planet prefers to get kids involved early so they are highly developed by they time they reach their peak performance years.

My master who is only about  and about lbs would have to brace himself while holding the pad so he didnt get mowed over. My legs are kind of big so I have to have strength to raise them obviously but the real reason I kick so hard is the power transfer its all in how you bring your knee up and rotate your hips to bring that weight around. Most kicks not just the roundhouse have a secret for doing that you just have to feel it out or have someone watch your form to see where you need to twist to put more of your body weight into the kick. I look at it like this If I just pick up my leg pivot and swing it thats throwing about lbs at my target. If I learn to properly rotate my hips I might then be throwing lbs or more at my target because now its the inertia of the rest of the my body not just my leg. ,taekwondo,d5cyjt8,2,t5_2r3yo

You are improving because its impossible not to improve to some extent when you actively train.Some people arent cut out for competition their minds are simply too timid and nonconfrontational but you dont seem to have that problem.  Plus those types of people should be forced to spar anyways to help them in those areas.  What you will find is that some people will greatly excel in sparring due to natural athleticism or naturally high fight IQ.  One can be a natural in both or can work to attain both.  Just how it goes.  ,taekwondo,dak5tsp,1,t5_2r3yo
9950933,0,t3_5i09b4,It may very well be that you stay at a white belt for awhile but move at a faster pace through the ranks again. I was in a similar situation to you when I came back  years gone as well but I was a green belt th Kup when I came back about seven months ago. He told me that I should start as a white belt but I should train like a green belt. When Im comfortable with my first poomsae move to the second third etc. Same for one steps. Start sparring as soon as I feel like Im comfortable then spar as often as possible. I had my green belt back within a month on this method training five or six days a week. Your instructor may be doing the same thing. ,taekwondo,db4mrwh,1,t5_2r3yo

10372062,0,t3_5nmt2q,I wanted to throw in here since your focus seemed to be self defense at my school ITF basically    of our curriculum was self defense. Meaning grabs chokes pushes etc. From the front back and all that. We also did self defense against a stick and a knife. These are pretty common in an ITF school or should be as they are in the encyclopedia and most people from other schools who would come to train with us seemed to know them or some close variation of them. The only part of self defense our school didnt cover was ground defense like in BJJ and other grappling arts.,taekwondo,dcjqhdh,1,t5_2r3yo

10795516,0,t1_ddtfr1g,Yup....for on you try to keep them in a line. But again that means youre going to be circling all the time which is going to wear you out in comparison to them because they wont have to be moving quite as much. For my nd dan I had to do on...of course in that case you cant  keep them in a line. You just gotta keep circling and play more defensively looking for openings when you can.,taekwondo,ddthb9r,1,t5_2r3yo
10904178,0,t1_de49evh,gt Taekwondo is undoubtedly amazing for self defense.I think TKD is decent for self defence but I wouldnt call it amazing. Its extremely rare to find a legitimately good TKD club these days that isnt aimed at kids and noncontact safety. IMO the onestep self defence curriculum in WTF taekwondo is undoubly much worse then just partner work with freestyle sparring. No one is going to stand still and strike at your gehap freezing while you obliterate them with strikes. ,taekwondo,de4osha,1,t5_2r3yo

11673949,0,t3_667ab7,If theyre attacking with a back kick especially theyre usually closed stance. If thats the case angle slide then back leg counter works but is not easy to execute.There are different spinning attacks people do so theres different counters for each one. If they are attack s off the line then a back kick works or even a front leg counter to the face. You shouldnt be moving back when theyre attacking  though as most of the time you will fall into their distance. If theyre attacking with a hook kick though a simple slide back back leg counter works well. You could also try and undershot but its harder to time. I dont recommend attacking with a back kick or hook kick nor even a  as a first attack as its harder to score with the initial attack and youre most likely to get countered then you would if you attacked with lets say off the line or fast kick as an initial attack.,taekwondo,dgj9b6v,3,t5_2r3yo
11722346,0,t1_dgoq3pn,Right you hit the nail on the head it depends what sorts of situations you are training for.so let me clarify that my comments were taken from a WTF sparring and streetself defensecombat perspective not from an MMA  or similar perspective....Also I have personally trained in other arts to deal with front take downs I have mostly trained to handle if you are front onand I believe would not be legal in MMA as thy include things like strikes to the top of the spinebased of the skull etc etc.So my comments are made I am sure biased on my own perspectives so keep that in mind ,taekwondo,dgoravp,1,t5_2r3yo
