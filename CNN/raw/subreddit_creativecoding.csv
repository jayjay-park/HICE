1049020,0,t3_1x3lgu,Before being called DevArt it was referred to as creative coding. not sure from where creative coding term stems but im curious! anyway for people interested to learn how to code creatively or make cool DevArt we do have a summer program in Berlin! artinteractivitycodeelectronicsfabricationrobots applications open until May th!  ...Because afterall your code belongs in an art gallery!,creativecoding,chnj0xs,1,t5_2w6qf

7545758,0,t3_4ipa43,I think so!  Through the use of an edge detection algorithm and a way to select which region of the image contains the object of interest it may be possible to in most cases obtain the set of pixel coordinates that belong to that object.  Work in converting raster images to vector outlines has already been done.  If you could convert the outline of this set of pixels to a vector outline youll have to choose some kind of threshold most likely you could then apply a tessellation algorithm to tessellate this region into triangles similar to how youd render an object on a graphics card with OpenGL.  To choose the colours of each triangle you could simply check which pixels map to each triangle and compute the average of the colour coordinates across all of them.  Finally render this set of triangles out over top of the original image and I believe you will have achieved an effect similar to what you are looking for.The challenge will be in choosing a good edge detection algorithm that will work in most cases and sensible default values for the various thresholds you will be using.Hope this helps!,creativecoding,d2zwzdo,8,t5_2w6qf

8246702,0,t3_4sdai1,This is a realtime visualization i created .Rendered a lot of blended dottextures side by side in OpenGL with colors and some texture fading. The movement is a basic physic system.,creativecoding,d58e65x,1,t5_2w6qf
9942059,0,t1_db272j7,A good point Ive seen Andrew Bell make at Eyeo in this video   is that C optimisation is important for CPU heavy tasks audio managing large datasets... but not so much for graphics which are happening on the GPU? If I understand correctly?That being said choosing between Processing and C frameworks I would prefer not to lose time and jump directly to C if I know that ultimately it is the end goal even if the beginning is a bit more difficult than with Processing.,creativecoding,db3h3hg,2,t5_2w6qf
11002706,0,t3_5x1m85,So does this in any way have to deal with seams in texture coordinates? Anything with spheres I always get frustrated by the fact that theres really not a simple way to texture the things for use with a shader.,creativecoding,def4i40,1,t5_2w6qf
