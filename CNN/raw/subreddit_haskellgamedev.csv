Yeah I guess from that the wiki article says it will do a GC when the nursery gets full so as long as it doesnt fill it in a frame there should be no mid frame pauses if it is forced at the end of every frame. Its probably worth waiting to see if it becomes a problem before doing this I guess.,haskellgamedev,ck9czqh,1,t5_33b07
