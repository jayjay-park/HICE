10307130,0,t1_dcburq2,OP recently moved to Roanoke or is still planning a move here from Colorado Springs CO which has just as weird but the opposite to VA alcohol laws.Just like in Virginia there are different liquor license classifications. Nonretail locations like grocery stores that sell beer and wine only and retail locations that can sell anything with alcohol in it no matter its strength but are limited to what percentage of their sales can come from nonalcohol purchases like mixers or snacks. In Virginia you can own a storebusiness and only sell beer  per year  additional to sell kegs or own a storebusiness and only sell beer and wine  per year  additional to sell kegs but in both these cases your customer can only consume offpremise. If you want a license that allows the ABC to approve special rooms in your business like dining rooms or bar areas or patios to allow customers to buy and consume within those rooms only the cost is  for beer and  for beer and wine per year plus  additional if you want to sell kegs. These onandoff premises licenses are more restricted sometimes only to rural areas so for those wanting to see that neat bar business concept in the Brambleton Rd Kroger expand to other Krogers its highly unlikely. But if you have either of these licenses offpremise or onandoff premise you arent restricted in the strength of the alcohol content so long as the product is classified as beer or malted beverage andor wine. However the rights to sell anything notclassified as beer or wine such as hardliquor are restricted. Consume onpremiseonly licenses for bars and restaurants can be purchased at yr for beer only and yr for beer and wine. Mixed beverage licenses are also available for onpremiseonly businesses and the price highly depends on the type and size of business ranging anywhere from  per year to several thousand dollars for private clubs with over  members. The only business allowed to purchase offpremiseonly licenses for mixed beverages and hard liquor is owned by the state of Virginia. The ABC is greatly restricted in what percentage of its sales can come from nonhardliquor items so its not seen to compete with privately owned businesses.In Colorado offpremiseonly licenses have two classifications one is like Virginia limited to beer and wine only but even further restricted in the alcohol content strength allowed in those beer and wines. The limit is . which disqualifies about half the beers made in the state that likes to call itself the craft beer capital of the nation. This . License is about  per year plus  if youre a new applicant. If you want to be able to sell beer and wine in Colorado with . alcohol content or more youre restricted in the other types of items or businesses you can operate. Restaurants pay about yr about the same as VA beer and wine only is about yr also about the same as VA plus a  new applicant fee not the same as VA. Unlike Virginia Colorado does not allow grocery stores or businesses in proximity to things like schools and churches to obtain gt. offpremise or onpremise for that matter licenses. But if you do meet the requirements to sell greater than . you may also meet the requirements to sell offpremise hard liquor which is about  per year. Colorado has no selfowned agency business operating with these licenses like Virginia has with the ABC.A lot of these laws in Colorado are really old and were recently overturned. Drugstores and pharmacies and grocery stores with drugstores and pharmacies can have up to  locations with new licenses to sell gt. beer and wine and even hard liquor. Stores in proximity to the weak and young or grocery stores without drugstores or pharmacies will be able to sell gt. beer in  but not wine or liquor.So yeah both states have really conservative laws concerning retail sales of alcohol but the restrictions as consumers see it come from very different angles. VA has a tight control over hard liquor retail sales but not much restriction on nonhardliquor sales while CO has a tighter control over nonhardliquor sales and not much restriction on hardliquor sales. Perhaps these differences stem from the history of alcohol and prohibition on the economies of each state. Colorado had very relaxed loopholes early into the prohibition era but has a long and deep economical tie to the production of malt beverages so it makes a little sense that the competitive nature of the beer industry that so affects Colorados overall economy would be more tightly controlled and taxed as it ventures into the hands of consumers.Virginias history with craft brewing isnt nearly as big and many would argue has only just begun but our economy was and is especially with neighboring states tied to the production and distribution of American spirits all legal before illegal during and legal after prohibition. With Virginia being a main line of transport between it and other neighboring states moonshine region to the highly populated New England states and their worldly cities it makes sense that after prohibition was ended and the funds for law enforcement were drying up the state put controls in place to profit from the sale and distribution of hard liquor.Neat.,roanoke,dccda30,4,t5_2s6k8
