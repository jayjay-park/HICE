320708,0,t1_cfb9m36,You were a big help thanks a lot.  Deep house is the groove that I harmonize with. Although I dont get down with EDM musicthat scene annoys me honestly I just wanted to know your opinion. I like that the house scene has a dope underground subculture.  That being said I feel that its hard to find other house dancers.What is the best way to find other people to dance with? ,HouseDancing,cfe0eum,1,t5_2z4l5
