Plus while i do have my periods of trawling through serahces on trademe for nd hand ps games or whatever sometimes like right now i havent touched it in months. If i saw something pop up that was a good deal it be interested. In a foreign city subreddit i frequent i recnelty scored a good deal on a nice bed someone sold us. Totally hassle free sale good dude and we couldnt find someone on ebay. In general people on here are a trustworthy hassle free bunch. Plus other cities have a seperate one for listingsselling but even in a large city like where i live it has really limited exposure and doesnt work as well as just posting it into the main sub. I think we should leave it as is until it becomes an actual problem. If i see someone posting a bike or something in here im not interested in i just upvote it and move on.

3505845,0,t1_cprvehu,Taranaki St is the biggest barrier to foot traffic in the central city. There is a continual crowd of dozens of people trying to cross all day and night. Ive seen many nearmisses particularly late at night when drunk people become impatient and drivers are more reckless. Its just a huge river of traffic right through the heart of town.Taranaki Street should be dug down into a tunnel from the Ghuznee St corner to Wakefield St. Courtenay Place would then be a bridge that connects directly with Dixon St and Manners St. It would no longer be possible to turn between Taranaki St and DixonCubaCourtenayno biggie though theres probably room for a slip road if necessary at Inglewood Place.Buses could use Ghuznee St and VictoriaWillis to get between Taranaki St and the station or potentially use the slip road if it was twoway or controlled by lights.Its seems a lot more valuable than a plaza out on the edge of town.,Wellington,cprw3fb,0,t5_2s3eo

3718648,0,t1_cqftu0j,Id be intrigued as to what you were trying to achieve by stating this?Also are you trying to imply that people are only poor because they get themselves in a certain mind frame and thus never find ways to be not poor? Id agree to a certain point. Exhibit A  homeless people begging on the street. A lot of them are so stuck in their way of thinking that theyll never work themselves out of it despite many of them having potential. On the other hand sometimes its physically impossible to not be poor. Exhibit B  me. For the next ten weeks Ill be expected to put in the equivalent hours of a full time job into my study even so I will be hitting up a temp agency once my current job finishes next week to see if they can get me the odd hour. But after that Im expected to put in  hoursweek. I wont have income simply because there arent enough hours in a day for me to generate any. I dont get anything from studylink or winz either. So I have to think poor so that I dont end up being homeless and truly being poor.Edit Also I dont associate thinking poor with enjoyment?? Or sadness or any emotion. Its just a practicality Edit FML this is one of those if you want to be rich you have to think rich things isnt it. Its true.

From a cycling perspective the current lanes are worse than before as half the bike lane is the dooring zone. I have made a submission about this and I hope they will trial the idea I posted above.Personally crossing the bike lane before turning left is better than having to watch for cyclists while turning left. Opinion is divided on this though. In theory having to cross the bike lane BEFORE turning left means that drivers can focus on fewer things at a time.Having the bike lane on the left of the left turn lane kinda works in Victoria as cyclists must give way to cars turning left.,Wellington,cuwlahd,2,t5_2s3eo

6469930,0,t3_448fj2,My advice would be to get a basic Honda Toyota or Nissan from around the mid s for about  for your first car. Many people new to car buying assume the more you spend the more reliable the car will be. But car reliability and repairability hasnt really improved on Japanese cars of the s.Something like a basic model  Civic or Pulsar if in good condition will be more reliable than a lot of cars  to  years newer with less stuff to go wrong and will certainly be cheaper and easier to fix if it does go wrong. You can completely destroy the engine and a replacement will only cost you a couple of hundred bucks in parts.Also theres always a chance when you dont have experience buying cars you will get a car that probably wasnt the best deal with a k car youre less likely to lose a significant amount of money on that than a k one.,Wellington,czojbyc,2,t5_2s3eo

Dried packs of rice noodles.Torches good ones and loads of batteries those Dynamo torches are pretty rubbish but better than nothing though.Also keep most things in a bug out bag but do try and spread some of the more common things like water and food around the house it would suck if it was all in one place and you lost all of it in one go.Consider some of the survival subreddits there are good suggestions for bug out bags that can be transferred to nz.

10733938,0,t3_5tixt6,Smaller govt agencies have better application odds. Since they dont tend to have specific grad programmes they may hire grads in generic analystpolicy analyst roles which tend to have a better pay scale structure than grad programmes. That said you miss out on some of the social opportunities grad programmes offer as well as the chance to try multiple areas of the agency. You also have to be a bit more independent as you may have a manager with less experience in coaching etc. MPI MBIE and Treasury have strong grad programmes off the top of my head. These are highly sought after. For grad programmes cover letters are super important and so are grades and postgradlegal background helps. Some agencies offer internships so if you have the time to pick one up it could be worth asking around. They arent always listed but can be on an as offered basis. Make sure your cover letter and CV are well put together and formatted with no spelling errors. Leaving your age off can be an advantage when going for a generic policy role.
