2742489,0,t1_cn535fx,The USCanada border is thousands of km long. Crossing lakes prairies mountains and even a desert at Osoyoos.  So yes it is possible to cross on foot undetected but getting harder every day.  The US uses motion cameras drones ground sensors patrols etc.They used to call it the worlds longest undefended border. You dont hear that much anymore post ,Borderporn,cnft5kr,1,t5_2v9l2

5528056,0,t1_cwhmqwb,Ive wondered this myself...somewhere along that road the border crosses it.  Are there any houses fronting onto the road.Another interesting border place.  Look at this road which crosses the border.  I believe it does that to avoid topography.  There are houses on the north side of the road that I think the border goes through the front lawn or the rear yard.Unfortunately the Google street view car didnt go down the road.  The cemetary is split by the border,Borderporn,cwi9arq,2,t5_2v9l2
