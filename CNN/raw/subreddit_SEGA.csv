4545804,0,t1_ct3la5o,Barely anyone cares about Sonic in Japan. And to be fair it was Sega of Japan that wanted to give Sonic longer spines sharp fangs and a human girlfriend when they started out. And lets not forget that time a Final Fantasy anime girl kissed Sonic. ,SEGA,ct3mhzn,1,t5_2rays
5328536,0,t1_cvsrprw,No. it wasnt so much a look at this game. And this game. And this game. It was more like a bunch of thrilling scenes from different games all mixed and passing rapidly. It lasted about half an hour for what I can remember.Ive been looking everywhere and I cant find it.,SEGA,cvss5ml,1,t5_2rays

10451414,0,t3_5poyec,I will speak as a member of the Latin American gamer scene as Im from The Republic of Panama.With the great help of the Panama Canal we enjoyed releative great gaming scene here we had the same Video game systems that were popular in the U.S. with only days in difference of launch dates and with great prices to match.It was around  when my mother asked then  year old me what I wanted for my Birthday which I told her I wanted Thundercats figures. Unfortunately these were sold out so Mom got me the next best thing a NES packed with Super MarioDuckhunt a second controller for my  year old brother it was used mostly by friends and the Zapper.Ive already had by then some video game experience under my belt playing a second hand Atari console a neighbor sold to us and we had this weird console that we called in Panama the Family. I cant for the life of me remember why it was called that or how it looked we only knew it played  bit games and had a Chinese look to it or it could have been a Famicom who knows.Returning to the NES I played that console daily and Mom learned the name Mario well as well as Nintendo.Flash Forward to the SNES era one day I was browsing with my mom on the toy isle of a major retail chain called Felix B. Maduro I had my first encounter with the Sega Genesis playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis Kiosk and it looked AMAZING!!! the speed the colors the sounds.... so much awesomeness.So I asked mom for a Genesis for my upcoming th Birthday to play with Sonic. She said she would think about it.Flash Forward a couple of weeks and I was walking with my parents in the Duty Free Zone of the Panama Tocumen Airport waiting for a outgoing flight to Colombia to visit family when I say the Demo for Super Mario World again I was in AWE the colors the music the graphics and most importantly Mario which mom immediately recognizes as Super Mario then she asks Wouldnt you like a Nintendo better? I know Super Mario better that the blue thing we say last time. And that was it she got me an snes with Super Mario World she knew the brand well and the name. I was split  on Sega and Nintendo but in the beginning we went with Nintendo mostly because of Brand Recognition. Specs didnt matter over here its who did you know had a a similar system to go and have game playdates.Later we got an n as Sega failed to make a lasting impression in Panama everyone sold Nintendo as it was synonymous with cash.It was until  years ago that I rediscovered Sega and got me a Dreamcast later a Model  with x then later a Saturn and finally a Game Gear which i now cherish and keep finding great games for them.But for the first years my family was a Nintendo Family not because they were better because it was the popular and widely available Video Game systems.,SEGA,dcsrmtr,3,t5_2rays

11498371,0,t3_642zc0,So depressing. I can see the Japanese devs being very stubborn. Even though they still wanted to make the games THEY wanted to make they couldve at least found some people willing to make more mature games to stay relevant.,SEGA,dfzc91r,4,t5_2rays
