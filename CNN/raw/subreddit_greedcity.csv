11533275,0,t1_dg3aebm,Thanks a lot for the quick reply and the detailed explanation.  Wasnt necessary to refund the card but I very much appreciate it.  Is there any way to play the card faster so I dont lose properties in the future?  Can I get to the card selection screen before time runs out to play it as soon as timer reaches zero?  Or would that not work?Once again thank you very much.  Great example of awesome customer service!  ,greedcity,dg3arsf,1,t5_2xecv
