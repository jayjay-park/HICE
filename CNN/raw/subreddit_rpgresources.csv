Very few if any publishers will want unsolicited submissions so contact the line editor about your ideas before doing any serious work on them. He or she will be able to advise you on format content and word count assuming your idea appeals and fits into the companys plans and requirements.Edit Now that Im at a computer Ive managed to look up some details about Pathfinder submissions They appear to be looking for short adventures from new writers rather than anything more substantial. This is a good way of getting your foot in the door. Once theyre seen your work and liked it it makes it easier to pitch larger projects.As both a line editor not for Paizo and a freelance RPG writer I can vouch for how much easier it is to get companies to consider large projects like books once they know who you are. If someone I had never heard of approached me with an idea for a book I would want to see something smaller from them first to get some idea of their abilities.,rpgresources,cmtn951,2,t5_2sja0
