2065078,0,t1_cl29acc,You can either copy it from the Pi edit it in a text edit program notepad in windows textedit in OS X and then copy it back over.Or simply right click amp edit the file straight from the Pi.You then have to restartshut down the Pi properly not pull the power out. So have the Pi hooked up to your display via HDMI have a mouse hooked up and select shut down or restart. I found that without a proper shutdown the edited file doesnt stick and just reverts back to default.To find out what your Pi is seeing the grabber as video or video have the grabber hooked up and send the command dev to the Pi. It will list shit loads of stuff Ive no idea what any of it means. But look for the Video bit. In the config find that section which refers to the grabber and make sure that all instances of video match what the Pi sees it as.If you need any more help just give me a shout.,Lightberry,cl2bezq,1,t5_33fdc

10083317,0,t1_da688ei,Word. I used to have Lightberry on my desktop computer setup but once I got I to p and hz on my monitors. That all went downhill. I just have a p TV so my other set works dandy on that. k is difficult unless you start from scratch AND you do only get max hz.,Lightberry,dblviwe,1,t5_33fdc
