3127502,0,t3_2vyzc5,I would guess not significantly more than in any other lifestyle. There is this idea that most homeless people are drug addicts but Ive always felt that that is just something people say to reassure themselves that they could never end up homeless unless they made the choice to start using drugs. Its a comforting lie that society has made up to convince themselves they are in control and only a bad habit like drug or gambling addiction could drive them into homelessness.When you delve into drug use and drug culture you learn very quickly that there is not a type that is more or less prone to drug use. Drugs are everywhere. They are used by rich poor black white Christians atheists and everyone in between. Some groups specifically groups that are more in the counterculture tend to hide their drug use less so it is more apparent that they use. But my guess is that if you are staying out of drugs in your current lifestyle you can continue to do so in any other lifestyle. But in certain lifestyles possibly this one I dont know Im just another curious observer here you might see it more but that doesnt mean youre gonna be made to participate unless you just dont have the will to avoid it once its out in the open.,vagabond,com5wn1,13,t5_2rogv

3213334,0,t3_2ww1m2,No one can really give you a stepbystep guide especially online. You have to firstoff understand that the only people that know exactly where a train is going and where it is stopping is the railroad. Train orders can change on a dailyweekly basis and there is no stepbystep method to figuring it out to  accuracy.However we do have things down to a pretty damn good science. We are usually  on getting destinations right and usually  accurate on how long the trip will take. And that  accuracy is something that simply comes with hanging out with hobos and doing it yourself. See those railroad maps on the sidebar? Use them!Ill give you a short exampleLets say you are trying to get from Los Angeles to Dallas Texas. Well if you look at this picture it tells you that the line going from Los Angeles to Texas is UP. So no you want to go to the yard in LA and look for any trains pointed west that have Union Pacific engines at the front. Once your train gets to Texas youll hop off at the stop at Sierra Blanca and jump on the the next UP that takes the line northeast to Dallas.As far as whether you jump on or jump off of the train while its moving depends on the situation. Most trains will stop just a few hundred yards or a couple of miles before going into the yard so thats when I usually get off. Sometimes your train may not stop until it gets into the yard so Ill jump off when it slows down to less than mph just before it enters the yard. As far as jumping on youll usually have plenty of time to watch the train and jump it before it starts moving.As far as more info your best bet is to go to your local trainyard and find the hobos.Where are you at?

Well one night he gets shit faced and tries to get me to give him head. I told him hell no but he wouldnt give up. I literally had to shove this guy away from me to get my point across. That pissed him off real good so he stumbled away shouting about who knows what. At that point I knew it was time to go so I put my shoes on and grabbed my shit. As I was about to leave homeslice  comes back but this time he had a big ass kitchen knife that he was waving around and screaming about how I was an ungrateful shit. He had some heavy ass ceramic thing on his coffee table so I grabbed that threw it at his head as hard as I could and got the fuck up out of there at light speed.

One way that they load coal cars is with an auger that spews coal out like a water hose as the car moves slowly beneath it.  If they were passed out from drugs or alcohol they may have been killed when the car was loaded originally.  Or like the article said may have been sitting on top of a loaded car and dropped through the dump gates at the generating plant when the car was unloaded.

4260712,0,t3_39r74h,After a quick read of the US Embassy website  it does look the like  month thing is real although as an article in Forbes see link below points out you arent actually limited to  months in a calendar year but you must exit after  consecutive months.  Although note All Canadians are reminded that U.S. law requires all foreigners to qualify for the desired stay and purpose at the time of their initial entry. A visitor who intends to live work or study in the U.S. without disclosing this information beforehand may be permanently barred from the U.S.  so I think that means you need to be honest about how long you intend to stay and what your purpose is when you cross the border.I think you probably want to say that you are visiting for vacation and intend to stay for up to  months and have your route plans mapped out that you can show them. You will not be studying or working since you need a visa for that.  You have adequate money for your travel plans for where you will sleep etc.I would think that crossing the border by bike might actually be easier since you look less like someone trying to move across the border permanently.... my brother once got stopped trying to cross the border when he was moving from the west coast to the east coast of the USA  he wanted to drive through Canada to see Toronto and Montreal on the way but he was denied entry he figured it was because they thought he was actually trying to emigrate to Canada.Heres some more info I found that might be helpfulEdit to clarify I think you should carefully map out an itinerary of where youre going and when with hostels and campgrounds marked that you can show the border guards even if you dont actually plan on following any of it or are really planning on wild camping.... although planning your trip for real is probably a good idea anyway.,vagabond,cs5wgdw,2,t5_2rogv

Previous to this with a ohm atty id do about  pg and  vg. im now  vg.. otherwise its like glass infused with barbwire sliding down your throat.VG that youd buy at say walmart is pretty thick. youd mix that with about  distilled water to be a little more pglike. Otherwise it doesnt wick. At least thats how you do it when youre a vendor.fyi i dont recommend walmart vg.. best to get it from a place like procter amp gamble in gallon size or larger. PG can be bought from tractor supply in gallon size for about . for flavor i dont notice much of a difference between using either mostly it comes to the wick.. too thick of cotton leaves me with zero taste and tons of vapor just enough to feel some tension while pulling it and semilose feeling with same juice  clouds  flavor.Cotton is annoying to get right but its so cheap and wicks so much better.i do however get much more flavor from silica wick. like they used to put in them CE tanks.

6847173,0,t3_4972r0,No experience with cargo passenger trips but my girlfriend decided to ship out on cargo ships in the merchant marine while I was overseas on Okinawa in the Marines.Briefly she was the manager of a Household Finance Corporation loan office in San Clemente CA.  I was in the Marine Corps based at Camp Pendleton just south of San Clemente.  We had a mobile home a block from Doheny State Beach in Dana Point CA.  This property is now milliondollar condos      My battalion got orders for Okinawa so we knew we were going to be separated at least six months.  It sucked.HFC fired her long storyit was bullshit the result of corporate downsizing.  She was mad as hell.  Trying to soothe her temper I said Gee honey try to look at this as an opportunity.  Now you can go get any type of job you want to!  What would you like to do?  She thought for a minute and said Ive always wanted to be a merchant sailor.  Oh right.  Like thats going to happen.  Well if thats what you want sweetheart you just go right down to the union and get you a union card.I totally underestimated my girlfriend.  She went to the NMU hall in San Pedro EVERY FUCKING DAY for six months until they finally gave in and gave her a union card.  She also had to get a Zcard from the Coast Guard and some other paperwork.  She shipped out the whole time I was on Okinawa and made a shitload of money working as a Steward Utility and a Cook then Chief Cook on board oil tankers plying the west coast from Martinez CA to Valdez Alaska hauling unleaded gasoline north and crude oil south.  She loved it at first but became increasing disenchanted because of the fucked up people that seem to work as merchant seamen.  Some were decent men but plenty more were scumbags.  She said It was just like being in prison except with the possibility of drowning.  But the pay was good.  On most of the ships there were about thirty sailors but only one or two women.  On the best ship one of the other women was an officer the second mate.  On the others the women had lowstatus jobs and were sexually harassed by some of the men not all.  One of the other women was a hooker and she made bank every trip usually doubling her pay.  My girlfriend said Her being a hooker was cool with me but I told her No customers in our stateroom.  You go their their room not the other way around.  I was VERY GLAD when she finally had had enough and quit shipping out.,vagabond,d0sfmmj,1,t5_2rogv

Ive went to temp agencies before and been asked if i could work that night on rd shift.In some areas factories are always hiring.  Temp agencies will  put you in a factory  but I did get a janitorial job at a college once from one. If you go in and apply bring clean piss with you or have your system clean they may drug test you right there. It takes about .hrs to apply to a new agency. If you go to a factory  do not listen much to what the temp agency says They may say you will work hrs st shift. Then when you get to the job site they can transfer you to a hr week nd to rd shift. Temp agencies cant predict what the company they put you into will do with you. Just follow their orientation schedule and the company will give you your real schedule Temp agencies are good as most pay weekly.  Ive used em a fucking ton. If you have any more specific  questions I can try to answer them Overall they are very reliable for fast work.  You might end up with a very hard labor job but hey you get  and  many agencies will work with you. If you get fired from one workplace for being unable to do the job they will reassign you. But if you fuck up  times you may be told to bounceThey do hire felons. Ive worked with folks who were released for murder charges. I have multiple misd. drug charges myselfJust make sure you can pass that drug testTemp work has supported me through my late teens to mid late sIt will be labeled as temp but temp is a broad term.

Plus since youre going on to discover yourself it would be a cool idea to try some fun things eat at fancy restaurants go to some barsbreweries the movies you know what I mean? Or maybe you just want to get a room for the night to relax and get some peaceful sleep. This will really save your sanity having the ability to get a comfortable room for a night or two whenever you want to will take worries off your shoulder and keep you at ease. There are bad areas out there sometimes sleeping outside is extremely unsafe and can land you in jail or even worse. Try to research an area you plan on visiting before you get there this is something Ive known a lot of travelers fail to do. You dont have to have a lot depending on how good you are with managing money  bucks can take you pretty far if youre smart with it.By all means go enjoy this lifestyle just remember that you dont have to add extreme stress on yourself. Because that is no fun at all. See part of being a vagabond is that people can basically do whatever they want without having to worry about much. If they dont like an area they can leave and not lose anything of value.Jumping into this lifestye without fully preparing is just not a smart thing to do.

But to comment on this thread I agree living by panhandling and busking isnt a way to be stable but if you have the talent it isnt necessarily living of someone elses dollar. For example in Burlington Vermont I got a permit from the city to busk. It cost me  bucks and I had to go perform in front of the city council so they knew I was at least halfway decent. So while I dont get a paycheck I do have to work for my dollar. Ive done this a few other places too and while I dont like flying a sign ill still do it when I need to.

Though apparently there was one small loan that didnt get swept up in that... so that sucks. But we. Cant pay it anyway and my credit is already shot so no big deal.Wait to get your license back. If you get back out on the road you may find jobs which require you to drive its a lot easier to already have a license than it is to get one fresh in a place where you have no addresscaretc. Save money. Sooner or later either youll travel in which case youll want gear or youll strike out on your own in which case youll need to pay rent.Are you just taking math courses or are you getting a second degree? cause courses wont do shit for you and if you really want to pay a school to teach you a marketable skill look into trades. Welding plumbing electrical automotive construction etc. Or better yet go around your town asking people if theyll take you on and train you in exchange for cheap labor. Get yourself an apprenticeship. CDL is also an option as there are lots of transientfriendly jobs available to those who can drive a truck. Programmingweb development also which you can teach yourself. In either case whenif you hit the road youll have a skill you can use in every town you come to. Easy money. No one is gonna pay you to calculate and those math courses will only help if you actually end up getting a science degree and unless youre actually going to get that nd degree all youre doing is wasting time and money and putting yourself more into debt. But no matter what you do dont expect your classes or your jobs to make you happy. Happiness isnt a circumstance or life event its an ongoing state of being you actively carry with you through whatever youre doing. Its something that takes work and effort to maintain as it relies heavily on how you choose to perceive and think about yourself and the world around you. If you find happiness while traveling its not because travel made you happy its because travel facilitated whatever it takes for you to learn to be happy or took you away from whatever it was which kept you from learning to be happy. Really though once you learn to be happy then you should be able to maintain that sense of happiness no matter where you areor at least get back to it after a while.If you cant well youre not happy. Youre just alternating between states of novelty and boredom.... and eventually everything gets boring. Even novelty.Thats the idea anyway.

11062832,0,t3_5xwx9g,If youre contemplating it dont do it. Its not worth it. Ridin around is fun for a while until suddenly it no longer is. I look back at the time I spent out there and in the end I got nothing to show except for lost friendships and a bunch of stories that most people wont ever understand. Find another way to occupy your time and be happy. Maybe talk to a doctor. Ive been in your position before sort of. Wherever you go there you are. Traveling around wont solve any problems.,vagabond,delycm6,5,t5_2rogv
11074741,1,t3_5y0jqq,Honestly really like seriously keep the rails to people who need them. Last thing we want is a greenie vacationer messing it up. Its different from a greenie traveler learning the ropes and learning from their mistakes. Some places you need to hop out and every instance of tresspassing due to people joyriding counts against us who rely on the railroads.,vagabond,denb8oa,1,t5_2rogv

11506883,0,t1_dg099vv,Im not knocking international travel Ive been to  different countries and want to visit many more but I think part of the argument of being so large is that it also has  times the population of Australia. Ive never been to Australia on my list but in the US state to state you can find vastly different cultures sometimes county to county. Im not saying not to travel but Im sure you could travel an entire lifetime in the USA and not see or experience everything. ,vagabond,dg0b1a1,14,t5_2rogv
