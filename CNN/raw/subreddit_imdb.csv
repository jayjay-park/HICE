10755215,0,t1_ddo1nxi,Thanks but I just asked a friend to use her phone to authenticate. Not that it matters anymore. The only reason I wanted to was to talk on the boards that are now being closed down.  Probably for the better though.  of the stuff I read on there is negative whiny stupidity.,imdb,ddpbic7,1,t5_2sfjj
10844434,0,t3_5v1m0t,i dont want to sound as desperate as all the other self promoters so ill just say youre free to post if you want. please fucking post there....right now i only have a clone of the front boards up but it has most of our posts on imdb preserved and accessable. i also gathered a large amount of the movie and tv boards as well which will be provided in the same searchable format you find on imdb. hopefully within the week. because it just wasnt possible to collect every imdb comment i made an effort to try and focus on preserving those concerning the more highly regarded titles. but i got some crap too like that swordfish movie with hally berry and travolta. i apologize.so come sign up and join. its painless no email required. and if you are looking for a place to discuss the walking dead after the new episode tonight im uploading a walking dead forum dump that has over  of our imdb threads preserved. this aint overand finally fuck imdb.p.s. the forum is still a work in progress and probably has a few bugs here and there. please offer comments and suggestions to help me make things better,imdb,ddyizjm,8,t5_2sfjj
