4404492,0,t1_csll8jr,My understanding is that Yoshin Ryu was one of the most influential and prolific jujutsu ryuha of the Edo period.  It now survives only through branch schools the art shown in this video being a branch of one of those branches.  It seems that this branch is a comprehensive art though based on the name I had thought jujutsu was its core.  Still from a MJER perspective it is not at all unusual to see iai and jujutsu done together.Regarding the technical points Ive never practiced the school and cant give you any sure answers.  However regarding the reiho playing with the saya in the hakama and striking the tsuka these are all seen in various other schools.  In particular Kurodafamily Tamiya Ryu and Katori Shinto Ryu come to mind.  Note that all of these schools to the best of my memory put the saya only through the hakama himo and not the obi.  I dont know if the saya insertion slip was a mistake but even if it was compared to the rest of the video it seems a bit trivial.I dont know why he is looking around while doing taito or looking down while tying his sageo.  Just keep in mind that different arts express zanshin in a different way.  Some lines of Daito Ryu for example raise their arms as if holding a blade ready to strike.  This is different from MJERMSR which in turn are the biggest and loudest influence on modern iai especially as done through the ZNKR and ZNIR who have in turn influenced other ryuha but different is not wrong.  I am reminded of an interesting blog post I thought it was ClassicalBudoka but I cant seem to find it about an embu in Japan.  All but one of the demonstrators entered carrying their swords in their left hand.  Seeing this a teacher of a different school remarked to the event organizer Who is this guy?  He doesnt even know proper etiquette!  The demonstrator later caught wind of this and explained himself saying Carrying the sword in the left hand is a position of readiness but I have no enemies here.  As it is taught in my tradition I carry the sword in my right hand out of respect.,Koryu,csm4de5,3,t5_2xj9v
6901738,0,t1_cz9v84v,There is Kajitsukas group based in Kanto which is pretty straightforward. Thats who is in the second video. The group seems to hold together fairly well despite having a number of different dojo and more than one system they maintain they also keep the Otsubo branch of Yagyu Shinkage ryu. There is a lineage based in Sendai which consists of I think two or three branches which may or may not be friends with each other. These are the people who always embu in armor with metal weapons. And they also dont sit in seiza.The solo kata stuff the kata with what looks like ricepaddy walking practice the full backflips and the strikes as near as I can tell are all associated with Shimazu Sensei and there seems to be more than one group that traces to him. I think all of the internal power business in YSR comes from him. I heard he was a really nice guy who has a lot of tremendously strong students. ,Koryu,d0ympri,2,t5_2xj9v

10932817,0,t1_de7d69n,I think you can get good without sparring but sparring makes you even better.Kata however... I must admit I am not a fan of kata  the kata used in goju ryu karate and the bunkai are way too abstract jundokan at least the IOGKF were better and they were utilized wrong IMO  the goal at that dojo was good form and kata my opinion is that karate is about fighting and kata is a tool to convey techniques not the goal.Ashihara kata are the best kata I have seen so far but that is an entirely different discussion.,Koryu,de7n5vy,1,t5_2xj9v
11246510,0,t1_df6afub,Im well aware of how difficult it can be to get a hold of lowry sensei DI did Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu Iaido for a year and a half or so.  If i could i would still be training.  But i want to practice koryu again it was amazing and i learned more from it then any other martial art in my life.,Koryu,df6rwxu,1,t5_2xj9v
