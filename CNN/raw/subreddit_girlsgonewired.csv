1506187,0,t1_cj4kofa,When I was hired I was under the impression the job would be about a  web dev and IT. It ended up being  for me since my coworker took care of nearly all of the IT. She always had the web dev title and I had the IT one. The new IT title he floated is a higher level title but Ive been doing the web dev job not the IT one at least until my coworker left and now Im doing both. It is frustrating because the web dev job pays better so my coworker was essentially doing the lesser job and getting paid for the better one while I was doing the web dev and getting paid as IT.And my boss and I talked. It was...difficult. It was right before I went on vacation for a week too and I agonized over the conversation for the first few days I was off. After about day  or  of my vacation my only thought was fuck it I said what needed to be said. Once I was back he treated it like it never happened and few days after that we learned our portion of state money was unexpectedly cut which sparked all of the budget stuff and made the whole conversation moot.,girlsgonewired,cj52pss,2,t5_2v7hs

2176961,0,t1_clgdjo2,its hard at first but you will feel better overall if you do. you wont be angry at them or at yourself. and everyone has their crosses to bear. that person that is acing all their classes might be as crushingly depressed as you because they have no friends outside of class. the girl thing sucks too. im VERY lucky that at my very small college it was a  ratio of boys to girls in my classes. all you can do is have faith in yourself and your abilities. it will work out in the end!,girlsgonewired,clgjm7q,2,t5_2v7hs
2349112,0,t1_cm21g7r,I started on a help desk. My biggest tip for a good career make friends and be polite to everyone. If you stay in the same city youll run across the same people throughout the years and very often its who you know that gets you the job or at least the interview! Keeping the job is on you but getting in the door is often the hardest part. Ive been working in IT for about  years and I feel like I know every other it person in the whole metroplex! Or at least Im one or two connections away from them. Every time Ive changed jobs I find someone there Ive worked with before and numerous people who know the same people I do! Someone who has a bad attitude is going to have a very hard time getting hired without moving out of town.,girlsgonewired,cm2280a,2,t5_2v7hs

3304397,0,t1_cp4pbkr,I came here to mention Gina Trapani. Shes what made me realize that tech could be a thing I do and like. When I learned who she was and saw a picture of her it was like my whole life changed. You know how older black celebrities sometimes talk about how seeing a black character on TV changed their lives? Seeing Gina Trapanis headshot on the lifehacker masthead changed mind. White brunette pretty but not overdone and we even had the same haircut at the time. My teeny teenager brain clicked and I realized that could be me! I could do all these things!I was at the time reading everything I could on a bunch of blogs Id found on stumbleupon because I had a crush on a boy who was halfway through earning some alreadyoutdated associates degree that had him talking about computers and stuff. I wanted to get my head around whatever I could so Id have a shot at understanding something he was saying and talking to him. I studied and it didnt feel like a chore and eventually I stopped caring about him because he wasis a loser but I kept going back to that google reader tab for more RIP.I really really really liked lifehacker. It was interesting but none of it seemed like it was for me. I felt like Id been reading the employee handbook for a company Id never actually work for cool but not something Id ever apply to real life and definitely not something Id want to admit I enjoyed I am a nerd and I love reading employee handbooks and codes of conduct so much that its embarrassing and I have to pretend I dont actually read them. Id never understood that there were women who worked with technology until I was confronted with a picture of lifehackers founding editor. This isnt a long time ago were talking mid here. I think that is complete garbage! It took me  years to ever actually completely process that there are female computer programmers and thats after Id already expressed interest in it. Dudes want to say all the time that there are no women in X field because they just arent interested. Its bullshit. Representation matters. ,girlsgonewired,cp4xeup,3,t5_2v7hs

4082001,0,t1_crktqv6,The number one form of discrimination I have faced has been what my career path should be.  I graduated from the same college as my husband and went to work at the same company as him.  I had better grades and more practical work experience than him.  They put him on the senior software engineer career path.  He is hands down the smartest person I know and he fully deserves to be the senior most engineer on any project he works on.  I trust his opinion over any other when it comes to making design decisions because he always wants to do the job right.  So you would think that someone who has worked hard and proven herself every step of the way should be offered the same opportunities right?  You would be wrong.  As a woman I faced a lot of pressure to become a DBA test engineer CM lead and team manager.  My husband looks the part.  I dont.  At  years old fresh out of school in the st century it is hard to say no to a project lead when he proclaims youll do great work as the team DBA.  I always tried my best to keep my foot in the door programming.  I would always volunteer for the programming assignments no one else wanted and I have always striven to do the very best job on them.  I am almost  years into my career now and I am driving the ship finally.  No one is putting pressure on me to be whatever they want me to be.  Part of that is because I have proven myself time and time again.  Part of that is because as you get older you start to realize that saying no isnt going to cost you your job or ruin the team forever.  If they want a DBA then they should hire a DBA.  That isnt what I do.  ,girlsgonewired,crlkny5,3,t5_2v7hs

5171981,0,t3_3lu431,It sounds like the shittalkers really are actively against including you even though youre doing your best. Im not sure theres much more you can do on a persontoperson basis to get them to include you since they seem to be of the opinion that youre not worth listening to and its not worth including you.So heres where going above their heads comes in. If your boss told your coworkers to include you and youre trying to include yourself in work and they are still excluding you it looks like theyre basically saying yeah fuck what anyone else thinks my opinion matters more than the bosss opinion and the efficient workings of the workplace. It doesnt help they are also talking in front of you in a way that indicates that theyre intentionally disregarding your bosss instructions. Thats pretty unwise of them especially if your boss doesnt take kindly to insubordination if its not enough that theyre being openly bigots.Start a log keep it with you and take it home with you of these incidents and be specific date time people involved what was said and done. When youve collected several of these incidents have a private meeting with your boss express your concerns especially if you are worried that due to their behaviour you wont learn the ropes fast enough to benefit the organization and show what youve collected. Its your bosss job to address the situation at that point.Youre not going to get these guys to like you and theyll dislike you even more for going over their heads but short of totally outperforming them and magically changing their minds in a way worthy of a Hollywood nerd fantasy youre not going to get them to like you anyway. Youll need to salvage what you can of this professional situation and find ways to learn what you can in it and you cant afford to let a couple of jerks like that turn your time at that job into wasted time.,girlsgonewired,cv9ewuz,27,t5_2v7hs
5310904,0,t3_3n7gyw,Okay lets say worst case scenario whatever you want to show or bring up to your colleagues is total trash. Even if this is the case you are still exposing them to a new concepttechnologyway of thinking. Intelligent people take every new exposure as an opportunity to learn. When you throw new ideas out there you are helping them grow as much as you are helping yourself. ,girlsgonewired,cvqj2yl,1,t5_2v7hs

11491301,0,t3_63waqh,ugh! at least at most tech companies interviews are given by other engineers. theyre technical. theres a defined rubric your soft skills really dont matter. frequently theyre given by engineers like your peers who are not inclined to give women an easy pass. And hiring decisions are made by committee not behind closed doors.,girlsgonewired,dfyjdbl,4,t5_2v7hs
11663596,0,t3_66cguo,Just as a start youre confusing the hell out of me here.  For examplegtI just went for an internship event... I dont want to be sleezy and ask for an internshipIf you want an internship do anything up to but not yet including kill a kitten to get an internship.  If an exec from a company for which you would love to work has contacted you directly tell the exec that you have long wanted to work there tell the exec why because that will separate you from the people who want to work there solely because the company will give them money for doing that and then ask for a position.  If you want an internship ask for an internship.  If you want something else figure out what that is and ask for that.  You dont ask you dont get.gti know Im going to get shit for being a womanYoure going to get said shit from people who cant play the Imawoman card.  Note that those same people do not accept shit for playing the Ihavearelativewhoworksthere card or the IhaveawesomegradesbecausemyparentsarepayingforeverythingandIdonthavetohaveaparttimejob card.  Youve been dealt cards.  Some of them are good cards play those.  Some are not roll those cards in Gravy Train and accidentally feed them to the dog.gtI dont get money for this and it does take it a lot of time.... but its all worth it because I take full advantage of the opportunity.  I let people know what Im looking to get then I aggressively follow up with them afterwards.  I talk with them about what they are doing so that I know who to pursue and who to cut loose.  I remember what they are doing so that I can talk in terms of their interests and make it clear that they are doing themselves a favor by having me as their intern.gtIve been meeting a lot of people at the Big s through the events and Im not quite sure how I should approach them.You should approach them in the same way you would approach anyone from whom you want something which is to say that you should talk in terms of their interests which is pretty straightforward if you take the time to listen to them and find out their interests otherwise its utterly hopeless and talk about how you can advance their interests which is straightforward if you took the time to find their interests and politely yet efficiently cut loose the people whose interests do not overlap your own interests and abilities.  From there its a simple business proposition  this person is doing ltXgt this person has an internship available heres how I can advance Project ltXgt.  If you dont have all of the qualifications use what you have because nobody has all of the qualifications and why do you want to lose out to someone who doesnt even have all of the qualifications?Good luck.,girlsgonewired,dgi30ni,10,t5_2v7hs
