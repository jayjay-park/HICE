A lot more discussion about the Rectors role reasons for and against. In previous years this vote has floated by my classmates and I but this did make a change.Yes it might not change the world or improve the university as a whole greatly but getting students speaking from their perspective involved in the university life is half the battle. Especially since a large chunk of the students commute in and generally dont get too involved.

454980,0,t3_1z9k9y,Im cynical and Im prejudiced and I have some issues with your post that Id like to make known. I worked at some of the top restaurants and industries in Chicago doesnt make any sense. So Ill read it as I worked at some of the top restaurants in the industry in Chicago. Reading the statements like that Ive got tell you top restaurants...in Chicago really probably doesnt mean shit in Glasgow. Not that we dont care that you have prior experience I just dont think anyone in Glasgow is educated enough to know what is and isnt a top quality restaurant in Chicago. I suppose there are some really high class joints somewhere around that might be clued in  but a year old student nobody isnt going to get work in those kinds of places unless they know someone or they are provably the best waiterwaitress in the whole of Glasgow. I also dont mean to toot my on horn. Yes you do and dont pretend otherwise thats what the top restaurants ... in Chicago was about. And what the next bit was about as well... assuming some people might wonder whether or not Im attractive. Urgh this always baffles me.  How you look may have some immediate impact on how people regard you but its rarely the be all and end all. I dont know why youd even bother to bring it up unless you really think it means a damn in which case you need to realign your perceptions slightly.Overall your post kind smacks of an arrogance and smarminess that I think that most people would find very offputting the exact kind of unpersonableness that restaurants dont want in a waiter or a worker. That is my honest first impression immediately having read your post.In terms of giving advice I cant because youve not given any worthwhile information for anyone to work with so all youve got for your trouble is the usual glut of Go work in McDonalds responses which is frankly a legitimate piece of advice for this situation.So in the interests of seriously trying to help you out...Where have you been applying to  are you looking exclusively within one industry or sector and are you looking for a certain calibre of establishment within that sector  or are you honestly carpetbombing every possible employer that you could reasonably be expected to work for and by this I do mean walking down Buchanan Street and through the Galleries and going into every shop one after the other without missing a single one of them with your CV asking if theyre looking to take somebody on?Other than top restaurants in Chicago do you have other experience or even qualifications that you could highlight to make yourself look more appealing figuratively to potential employers?Also where in the city are you looking for work and could you expand that area outwards even though itll be a longer journey in a city whose public transport infrastructure is something to be pitied rather than mocked?Other than asking those questions heres my hitlist of places you work McDonalds pubs clubs clothes stores learn an instrument and busk or take up prostitution.

My coach at New Life which has sampc boxing grappling Muay Thai wrestling and MMA classes can be somewhat controversial but he is a very good coach knows his stuff and as its not a massive gym we usually get good time with him.The Royce Gracie Academy is instead a BJJ only gym mainly focusing on Gi classes but with a couple conditioning and NoGi classes too. Also an excellent gym.I cant speak for other gyms but the athmosphere at both the ones I attend is great and welcoming to all I started just under two years ago as a full beginner and at new life as the only woman at the time and was always made to feel very welcomed.Edit We also have coaches from GTBA through for our MT classes and they are great as well so if you are into Muay Thai GTBA  Glasgow Thai Boxing Academy in Partick  may be a great place to go to.,glasgow,ch4vhl2,1,t5_2rgo2

It shows that in any democracy the parliament will always exist some distance away partly disconnected from areas it governs.

Suggesting that OP should fabricate a taleuse conjecture against the landlord is also a bad idea. If the landlord isnt involved in this youll lose their cooperation.

4751545,0,t1_ctte43u,I get you are trying to be magnanimous but really it does not work in this situation. Blackouts are not a condition you can predict they can occur randomly and can clear as soon as they have happened. By which point the damage can be done.The DVLA asks for your medical history for a reason to make sure you will not endanger the lives of others. You have to undergo a health check when even applying for the provisional for the higher categories of license entitlements and your doctor signs you off as fit to drive. However that check requires honesty and Clarke was most certainly not honest when he was asked time and time again about his medical history. Aye he wanted to work most certainly had bills to pay but if he had done it properly at FirstBus he could have probably been transferred to a position that didnt require him to drive. When you are driving any vehicle it is a potential weapon whether its a car or van and the heavier you go the greater the responsibility. Something over . ton can easily massacre a crowd of people as Harry Clarke has found out. Im thinking of going for more entitlements on my license and I will happily do it if I am found medically unfit had a few health probs with migraines in the past but nothing like blackouts then so be it. Driving is not a right its a responsibility one that really needs treated seriously and I am so sick and tired of people not treating as something serious. We license people to drive for a reason. Its dangerous if not respected and with the information we have from the FAI I dont think Harry Clarke had enough respect for it. Now  people were dead  people seriously injured and dozens of others traumatised. The causal link for all that is Harry Clarke. I can feel sorry for him and I have a coworker who knows him and says you couldnt have met a nicer guy but at the end of the day if he had surrendered his license due to his history of blackouts  people would still be here and  people wouldnt have injuries that could affect them for the rest of their lives. Lying by omission is still lying and it had consequences for not only Clarke but arguably the entire city. I am not entirely sure he should be prosecuted yet as there is still a lot of the FAI to go but if the families decide to go for a private prosecution I cant exactly blame them at this stage.Im not going to lie I find this all pretty upsetting as I knew Jack Sweeney one of the victims a little bit from working at Faslane not well though. He was a friendly affable man who always said hello in the morning goodnight at the end of the day and have a good one at the weekend.He helped you out the door at work if you struggling out with bags or something heavy and was just a general friendly bloke who was always looking forward to time off so he could spend it with his family and he would always talk about the family and what they were up including his wife Lorraine and granddaughter Erin who are also now dead. He was just a nice guy who didnt deserve to die the way he did and its not fair. Frankly its shite and its the fault of one guy for not owning up to the DVLA about his health. He didnt own up for a reason he knew he would lose his license and thats on him.    ,glasgow,ctth6or,1,t5_2rgo2

4890122,0,t1_cuarrpr,Its difficult to say anything about his culpability with certainty without knowing a good deal more about his medical history. However failure to inform the DVLA after you have developed a notifiable medical condition is a crime.It is a crime precisely because things like the lorry crash can happen. Were this his first blackout at the wheel or his first blackout at the wheel after  years with no intervening symptoms no severe underlying cause found then he would legally have no culpability it would be an accident. If he lied or failed to inform the DVLA to maintain a Drivers licence then he should be prosceuted because its a crime. To be aware of an impairment to drive and to continue to drive despite this means that you are culpable for any homicide that results from you being on the road.Refusing to tell the DVLA and persisting to drive despite being repeatedly told that you are unfit to do so is actually one of the circumstances where your doctor is allowed to break your confidentiality and tell the DVLA themselves.,glasgow,cuaxt09,1,t5_2rgo2

6710658,0,t1_d0deogx,Cant really explain it but a snapshot of what I know...Scottish junkies aside mainly its Roma gypsies doing a large amount of the begging. They come from Romania where theyre treated like rd class citizens at best dogs at worst. That last sentence is very important. A lot of them dont speak very good Romanian as Romani is their first language two completely different languages so its difficult to get a job there so begging to a large amount of Roma is basically a job a way of life almost. Old habits are hard to break when youre raised that way I guess.Ive lived in Eastern Europe myself and have seen the shanty towns with no electricity or running water where they live. Bulgaria Hungary Serbia Romania the gypsy really is treated like shit.So theres all that going on. Then like you say benefits are not bad in this country not bad but if you can go out and get an extra  or  quid a day each by just sitting on your arse thats even better!Sorry I cant give a proper insight into it.

7513186,0,t3_4i6b29,For conditions weather and resort info Winter Highland is a great web siteOur resorts areGlencoe   minutes drive accommodation on site cheap during the week  lift pass quite small but really cool terrain staff have a great attitude. I personally love it. The run from the summit down the spring run to the bottom is awesome and the flypaper is terrifying  degree inclineNevis Range  the other side of fort William. Probably over  hours drive. Bit of a drive but theres loads of accommodation in the town. Fairly big area some more modern lifts by Scottish standards the real appeal is the back corries though they are often shut early season. Google for some pictures and videos honestly up there with riding anywhere in the world with the right conditions.The Lecht  dont bother its miles away and not that goodCairngorm  the area used to be great but the ski setup is being slowly mothballed in favour of tourists riding the train. Brutal queues  hours between parking and first run isnt uncommon. Some decent terrain on the west wall area but not what it used to be. Most expensive resort weve got. The big advantage is the town of Aviemore nearby has lots of accommodation.Glenshee  the biggest resort weve got.  min to  hour drive. Infrastructure is getting a bit old but theyre slowly adding and upgrading lifts. The place is big enough that the crowds spread out so queues arent as bad as other resorts. The Tiger is a great black run with a new nd hand chairlift. The Glas Maol area is a really nice wide long red especially compared to lots of the other shorter runs. Braemar is nearby with accommodation and pubs.Skiing in Scotland is rustic as fuck compared to countries that get a decent winter. Lifts are mostly drag lifts. Food on the hill is pretty poor. Its very weather dependent too. I personally never book ahead and just get in the car and go if the conditions are good. Try and get a midweek to avoid the queue.

9077658,1,t1_d82oxo0,If the swatting craze in the US has taught us anything its that all it would really take is an anonymous tip and anyones home can be raided. Sometimes when neighbourhood disputes get REALLY out of control youl get neighbours anonymously phoning crimestoppers or something saying their neighbour has a bunch of guns or a meth lab or something else they probably saw on TV and next thing the neighbour knows they have a garden full of police usually with a warrant to enter and search the premises. Most likely he was caught up in selling stolen goods even unwittingly  after all if hes a market stall trader he wouldnt be the first and they got some intelligence that items connected to the robbery were at his home. He either refused entry or they believed that a surprise search would mean he wouldnt get  the chance to hide what they were looking for so they got a warrant and searched. Searches can leave a bit of a mess  sometimes theyll have to break in a door or a safe or rip up floorboards etc. If the warrant was in good faith then no  you wont get compensation from the police for the repairs or cleaning up afterwards. If they searched the wrong address and kicked in your door instead of your neighbours then yeah theyd pay for your new one but youd have to go through a process to do so. He could have made a complaint against police but thats police investigating police and it would take some really serious fuck up for them to be found to be in the wrong. If the police are given faulty information its not considered to be them in the wrong and if they served the warrant correctly then any damages are during the course of duty and necessary for the investigation. Not much you can do. ,glasgow,d82zjvu,1,t5_2rgo2

I wouldnt blame you for wanting out if it has stopped feeling home anymore.Im a university student in Glasgow currently studying abroad in South Carolina actually and I think its a great city for young people and white collar professionals. Theres lots of stuff to do and the whole place will feel refreshing for a Canadian. The cost of living is relatively low compared to UK cities and theres a good night life and music scene.I grew up in nearby Helensburgh  mins away and I couldnt have asked for a nicer childhood. There are good train links to lots of similar commuter towns. If I were raising a family Id definitely look to places like Helensburgh Bearsden or Milngavie pronounced Muhl Guy. Theyre fairly expensive by local standards but k would definitely see you in any of these towns and they have respectable schools. We actually had a Canadian kid move here when I was in high school not at all common its probably  ScottishBritish and he did well. Some laughing at accents naturally but nothing nasty!The education system is of good quality and has seen me and my siblings through into tax funded university.If you want to live in the city itself theres lots of advice here but Id definitely advise checking out commuter towns.Try come visit on holiday or something get a good feel for it because its obviously a huge decision and youll naturally want the family onboard!Best of luck.Edit As for being a Glaswegian... Im from  minutes away and most true locals would probably think me a posh boy fairy on accent alone .
