342706,0,t3_1y0jm2,yes this happens all the time. I played at a large club for  years In pittsburgh. We would get the guy who was best in his neighborhood or unbeaten bar champ and they would walk in and request to play our best players.  Now mind you we had  state champions a former olympian and one of the seemiller brothers who broke top  world wide in doubles. So unless you are a solid  you probably arent going to make it to the top table in our club.  There was one  player who would warm up with you to place you. If you came in with attitude he would start with the cover of a book. IF you couldnt beat mr hardback book cover then you were going to be relegated to the beginner table.Welcome to real table tennis. Its an entirely different world! in all my years ive never seen a basement champ come in at higher than  at least you did yourself a favor of playing in the U event instead of playing in the open.

1242999,0,t3_28b7ko,So I had to buy an outdoor table due to not having room indoor anymore. Besides the aluminium creating a slightly higher bounce I have enjoyed it. For one when casual playing most personal indoor tables are put into spaces too small to play far back but in an outdoor setting space is not an issue. Wind does play a factor sometimes but as long as its gentle its easy to over come and makes for some varied gameplay.  I quite enjoy playing outdoors. TLDR For casual play its fine.

6644792,0,t3_46ndiz, Being in a certain height range lets say roughly . to . can be a significant advantage in closetothetable play because of having a better POV of whats happening on the other end of the table as well as being in a more natural position to strike the ball. Handeye coordination is obviously a tremendous natural advantage as is being physically explosive so as to have advantages in speed power and quickness. General intelligence helps a lot in this the most technical of all racket sports.  The ability to think both tactically and strategically to construct points make adjustments and to understand what the opponent is doing are extremely important. Being flexible and light on the feet help make for a fluid adaptive nonrobotic style.  Particularly for looping and chopping Id say. Good eyesight and alertness are very important for this intense technical sport. I think just about any natural advantage also has the potential to become a disadvantage when players overrely on it to the neglect of other parts of their game.  In fact Id say this is virtually inevitable with most club players that Ive seen in the states.,tabletennis,d06mnpx,3,t5_2rmfh

Reconsider just learning the European style which Zhang Jike puts to effective use. Note that its easy to say learn this style or that style but you have to do it in practice and in matches.

Youll be aiming to see some significant movement off the bounce.Work on making your short serves consistently short and low regardless of the spin. Being short and low is more often than not more valuable than the spin.These two exercises will help you develop the timing handspeed and contact necessary for the services. Once youre comfortable with both bring the skillsets together. Your first attempts will probably have medium serves with medium spin but youll have enough experience with service to tune the dials.As youre working on your service dont add any extra flair deception or complex motions.

10101001,0,t1_dbo5p70,Well I guess if someone smashes youre already in a tough spot. Ideally the superior shots youll hit with a changing grip means theyll get less smash opportunities and youll get more of them. And once people get the grip change down they can usually shift it in time to at least attempt a block on a smash.,tabletennis,dbo69i8,1,t5_2rmfh

10366152,0,t3_5of5cc,Ratings are really a fickle thing so its very difficult to know what level you are simply by comparison. Also it is incredibly hard to visualize what you play like yourself making this approximation even worse.I find people tend to overestimate themselves by about  points if they dont have an actual rating.In my opinion the only way you can truly know is to play a couple of tournaments.Otherwise its just wild speculation.,tabletennis,dcj2dal,5,t5_2rmfh

10872878,0,t3_5vee8o,The jumping behavior on a table tennis table becomes the more uniform the thicker the plate is. There are indoor table tops with a thickness of mm and below. Surfaces on competition table tennis tables start with mm the standard was mm and today is mm and mm. There are also thicker surfaces. In the private area is at least a mm thick table to recommend.I just copied that and translated it with Google translator I would just recommend you the mm one because if you train alone it wont make a huge difference for you,tabletennis,de1gkiw,1,t5_2rmfh
11342285,0,t3_61vkcc,Well you basically have  choices on a backspin ball either you push it Which will just return the ball with backspin again.    Or you loop it which is a more advanced stroke. it requires a lot more timing and you need to brush the ball a lot more then just hitting it straight on or it will go in to the net like your friend is doing.    Understanding how spin works in table tennis is very important. This video shows it quite clearly.    When your friend starts to learn how to push the backspin back to you you can start to alternate between backspin and no spin services that look about the same. If he tries to push that the same way he pushes a backspin he will put it outside the table.,tabletennis,dfhmmm7,5,t5_2rmfh

11496677,0,t1_dfyljbd,I dont think you can go wrong by getting the beginner paddle at Coles. I havent used the rubber options that are currently being sold but after reading the descriptions I would suggest Reflectoid.Understand that uniformity in your shots has much more to do with your technique and ability to read spin than the equipment you are using. I dont know what youve been using but custom blade and rubber combos are usually much livelier than premade paddles. The ability to generate spin means a custom blade is also going to react more to incoming spin. Even though reflectoid is a relatively lowspeed highcontrol rubber when compared to other custom rubbers expect to hit a lot of balls into the net or off the table at first especially if your opponent knows how to spin the ball. ,tabletennis,dfz5bwp,2,t5_2rmfh
