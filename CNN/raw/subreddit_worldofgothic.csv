2388006,0,t3_2m3s5m,Its a bit tricky though to continue after G due to many possible endings. While G and G had pretty straightforward endings different only in minor details G was way more different.  Damn the thing I miss the most is the G combat system,worldofgothic,cm6v5iv,3,t5_2u3ss
3190555,0,t3_2wnqmm,Close all unrelated tabs that are not necessary to run your system. I for one always had to close all mouse  audio driver tabs before being able to play Gothic I. Close one after the other and wait a few seconds to find out which of them are blocking your game.,worldofgothic,cosp8ns,1,t5_2u3ss
3217221,0,t1_covghfd,Oh yes i remember the part about Torlof  how could i forget i never did go with Torlof  allways went with Jack . are there any more consequences  like more dialog options with hagen or someone ?,worldofgothic,covgt5r,1,t5_2u3ss

7274164,0,t1_d24iyzt,As I said in the description. It was really difficult to pick these tracks because for me almost everything was just as equally beautiful. And it was meant to be a mix not to copy paste  of all the tracks in one. Everyone could have done that. So thats why I picked these they were more memorable. I do hope you still enjoyed it !,worldofgothic,d250vak,1,t5_2u3ss
7690053,0,t3_4gpmvx,There are rapiers in the game that requires high DEX instead of STR specifically made for bow users.Youll be fine.Only problem is with those is that their damage still scales based on STR but they require DEX to equip so you will basically be like a strengthless warrior that can wear high tier weapons.Also undead they are immune to ranged weapons i think? Use magic or the rapier.,worldofgothic,d3gb5q5,1,t5_2u3ss
7787876,0,t3_4lrb4l,The game is old and not very popular.I doubt itll get more buyers opposed to the investment they have to make.Plus there are already a bunch of HD mods you can apply yourself.,worldofgothic,d3rewt0,1,t5_2u3ss
7802221,0,t1_d2b9pix,youre not the only one!,worldofgothic,d3t13q1,1,t5_2u3ss
7872142,0,t1_d3y8o4t,Tried it...nothing new.I just downloaded a first edition of Risen  and it works. Looks like that was the problm with EE. ,worldofgothic,d40wg6a,1,t5_2u3ss
8637031,0,t3_4y3nib,Im not surprised you feel drained since you wanted to kill every monster in chapter . P Take a few days break and play . Its better than  although I love both equally.,worldofgothic,d6l8jek,2,t5_2u3ss
8670854,0,t3_4ynose,After all i think it looks quite nice. Event though I am not sure if I like it fighting wise. Doesnt look like there are manny different strategies except for the jetpack that looks a bit silly. But I am interested in where this game is going.,worldofgothic,d6ph7b2,2,t5_2u3ss
8678343,0,t1_d6qeoef,I already finished playing all factions. Thought you were talking about some mod I hadnt heard about. ,worldofgothic,d6qf09l,1,t5_2u3ss
9228970,0,t3_56p567,I havent played Forgotten Gods even tho i have it on my PC.But from what ive seen its just poorly translated and voiced which is its problem mainly for the English Version as ive seen from some  youtube videos.As for Arcania it really doesnt feel like a Gothic game but much rather like some random first person action adventure game instead of an RPG.,worldofgothic,d8lu8ho,1,t5_2u3ss
9523394,0,t1_d9myh3d,Well if it would break contracts with THEIR publisher that does not necessarily mean that.,worldofgothic,d9mykrz,1,t5_2u3ss
10819300,0,t1_ddvx5mh,Have you checked up the new content mod . for G? Maan they made the paladin armors look exactly like in . Just wow.,worldofgothic,ddvxnig,3,t5_2u3ss
11056404,0,t3_5xs922,I grew up on Gothic I and II NotR Battlefront II Flat Out and Lego Star Wars II  All great games I still have a lot of titles on my list to play so cant really make a top list but these  games will always be in my memory with Gothic being at the top. When I wasnt running around the playground like a tard with my friends I was running around like a tard in Gothic I and II NotR. Man those were the times probably the favourite part of my life .,worldofgothic,del83x7,1,t5_2u3ss
11222004,0,t3_60343w,Although diehard fans of Gothic probably wont use it its a nice mod for new players or anyone displeased with original controls. I support whatever makes this game more recognizable and controls though I personally loved them were one of the reasons for little reception of the game in the US.,worldofgothic,df400ok,1,t5_2u3ss
11759217,0,t3_665ycr,Yeah.. that pretty much was one of the coolest things a game has ever done. Take you back to the world of the first game within the second game. At the time it also just showcased how far technology progressed in that very short amount of time.  I remember having to buy a graphics card just so I could play Gothic  and by the time Gothic  came out just a year later I had to build an entirely new pc. ,worldofgothic,dgsxqrx,2,t5_2u3ss
11782676,0,t3_684fjx,Well if you want the pure G use it without the alternative Ai or balancing honestly I could never really get into G no matter how hard I tried. I streamed it once got like  hours in and ragequit. I will probably never be able to love this game for its better parts despite its worse ones so take that into consideration.,worldofgothic,dgvlrs2,2,t5_2u3ss
