The gift that she gives Ben at the end of the birthday episode is a perfect example of her distancing herself from that aspect of Dee.  Or hell even caring that he swallowed the balloon in the first place.  Dee wouldnt have given two shits.You could argue that these moves were self serving balloon  jail for micky amp birthday present  assert dominance...but still you can tell she cares about the kids...something Dee would never do,TheMick,dcmspy7,3,t5_3cy6b

I honestly has no expectations of it being good but around episodes  it really started picking up and had me laughing out loud frequently. I look forward to watching it each week and I generally am so critical of new shows that I never have anything to watch. Mick may be riding on Sunnys coattails but theyre doing it right.,TheMick,decsghs,2,t5_3cy6b
