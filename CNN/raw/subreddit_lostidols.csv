DPS will also net you  more goldminute if youre not instakilling which means you will be able to progress faster to the next level.  gold bonus will do the same thing except you might not be able to farm the same level as the  DPS bonus so with equal bonuses you should always prefer the DPS bonus if your goal is to get as far as possible.,lostidols,d14gysl,1,t5_39gmh

And the follow upgt Crafting gear outside of that limited set will require you unlock additional recipes. How do you do that? Missions! New missions will appear enmasse to help you learn new recipes.So you will have to do missions to get the Rare and Epic recipes for the base  slots and to get the recipes for all the slots of the other Crusaders event and  but you will be able to get the recipes from the missions.gt Event crusader amp  recipe missions will unlock all the common and uncommon recipes for specific crusaders once that crusader is unlocked giving players a way to deck out their newly recruited event crusaders in basic gear even outside of the event itself.,lostidols,ddqtglx,2,t5_39gmh

10885992,0,t1_de1r16t,While I agree the rate is questionable perhaps even Bad if you want full Legendaries on everyone the rate is not as bad when you consider our largest formations are  crusader slots or  items. Even if you account for swapping out cru for specific uses you shouldnt need  legendary items for a full group.That  item bit is also made less bad by the fact that some items are going to be better than others some are going to be worse so you wont need full Legendary on your formation to be effective.Since CNE stated we can check the full Legendary effect before making it we likely wont need to make more than  legendaries a year once we have our form set and that is being generous assuming  cru being released a year who firmly shove out others in the formation.Not trying to say you are wrong just offer an alternate point ,lostidols,de2t9gu,3,t5_39gmh

You can then carefully click on only the boss to make them take extra damage mimiced Im unsure if its x  x or just x. Either way it helps quite a bit on the boss.  Throw in a triple stack of click buffs and I have frequently killed the boss before any minions die then you can just let the minions die on their own over time they never enrage  or click through them individually.Also  I know you dont have the E but Karens L Catnip is one Im getting Tuesday.  Im pretty sure the extra x damage from a L catnip and  deaths will take me the rest of the way I got to  last time I tried.
