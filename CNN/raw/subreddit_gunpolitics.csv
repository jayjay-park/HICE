In Operation Fast and Furious ATF agents allowed straw buyers to purchase some  firearms. The agents intent was to track the guns to Mexican cartel chiefs.gtBut the agents lost track of some of the guns which subsequently were used in scores of crimes that led to death or serious wounds for at least  Mexicans and one U.S. Border Patrol agent. Last June the House of Representatives voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in criminal contempt for refusing to turn over documents related to the botched gunrunning sting.gtThe number of weapons involved in Fast and Furious however would be less than  percent of the number of weapons that are reaching Mexico illegally each year if the study is accurate.gtIn concluding recommendations the study suggests that purchasers of firearms in border states be barred from paying cash for the weapons. Requiring the use of checks or credit cards would help to ensure that funds used to buy guns at legitimate establishments will not originate from illicit business activities it says.gtThe study urges more sophisticated U.S. background checks of buyers to help identify straw purchasers and the development of a database of seized guns in Mexico. It suggests that U.S. authorities gather more data on sales tax revenue from gun stores by county to identify unusual activity that should be investigated.TIL Its ok for our government President Attorney General ATF DEA  to deliberately run  guns into Mexico and lose track of them  which were used to kill about  Mexican nationals and a few Americans  because the number is less than  of the total for that year if this study is accurate.Since the scheme continued over approximately  years can you imagine the agents reports and their bosses responses Agent We lost track of a hundred guns this month boss.

Boeing moved their executive ranks from Seattle to Chicago many years ago yet their plane manufacturing still takes place in Everett Renton and Seattle.  Granted these are planes were talking about but the same principles would still apply.  Moving manufacturing requires a facility that can support the demands then you have to move tooling and warehoused items plus personnel turn down one facility and get the next facility up and running all of which costs an astronomical amount especially downtime since theyre not making money if they dont have product to sell.  In contrast moving execs means finding some office space moving some office furniture or just acquire some new stuff move the computers although I think most work out of a laptop these days and fly the people.,gunpolitics,cj5fdlm,1,t5_2sumr

Peoples priorities change and what truly matters in life changes.The only right we have no matter what is the right to die. You and I arent entitled to shit just for being alive. What if my rights included something harmful? Should I keep it because society deemed it my right? Or does the priority dictate I dont need it. You want to live in the woods all Jeremiah Johnson style you can decide what rights you have. Well thats not true. Nature instead of people decide. But you live in a collective society and it dictates what you can and cant do what you are entitled to and what not. Now Ill ask again. What makes you so confident that you would stick to your guns so strongly if life truly got hard?Also of course you didnt hear about guys who did their jobs right. First of all I doubt you looked for it. Second that isnt news worthy. I doubt you actually know much about what happened in the first place beyond a very superficial look. I love to hear Bostonians who were there talk about it myself. For you that would just get in the way.

Additionally in actual justified self defense shootings any collateral damage you cause by accident while engaging that threat is attributed to the person who forced you to use lethal force in self defense.Additonally not every self defense shooting happens on a crowded street and I would hope any concealed carrier would use extreme caution engaging a threat in an enviornment filled with innocents. There are plenty of places where there is little to no risk of collateral damage which is where most assaults occur when no one else is around.It is important to remember that blind people have the same rights as the rest of us. It isnt our right to judge them as unsafe and deny their rights any more than it is the right of a New York City police chief to judge ordinary citizens as unsafe and deny them the right to carry a gun in public for self defense.

Generally that just means asking if youve fired a gun before but its up to the owner to be more indepth when questioning.Of course if they see anything unsafe they should come onto the range immediately. The fact that a group of women were pointing the muzzle at other patrons and no one from the shop came out and gave them the ultimatum to leave or have an instructor with them while on the range at their own cost means you were not at a good range. I know the ones Ive been at are very keen on watching the cameras on the range and get onto people for doing unsafe things all the time even when its experienced shooters doing shooting drills they shouldnt do at a public range.Ive been to ranges that require you to either have a carry permit or some other safety course certificate before they let you rent a gun. I think thats ridiculous but I get it.But Im very much for gun rental. I wish more gun ranges offered the sampler and would let you spend a day on the range and access to every rental gun they have. After all what product other than a gun is it commonplace to buy before getting to try it? Sure Ive been one range that gives you a free month pass if you buy a gun from them but you still have to buy the gun before shooting it.

4138591,0,t1_crpah17,you had asked about how MAIG determined the actual legal status to own of their sample group.  they discuss their methods on p.  of the report fresh link here. its the last few paragraphs of the first column on that page under Data Collection section.  heres the relevant text cut and pasted from that.  italicized part is the short answer to how they did thisgtOur investigators scraped a software technique forextracting online data  wanttobuy ads forfirearms posted on Armslist from February  to May   and examined them for identifyinginformation. Unique phone numbers or emailaddresses were found in  of the ads. Usingreverse lookup phone data  of those identifierscould be linked to an individual living in the statewhere the ad was placed.  Investigators then conducted criminal record checkson each individual by searching court records in thegeographic areas where the individual was knownto have maintained a current or past address. Anyfelony convictions domestic violence misdemeanorconvictions bench warrants or orders of protectionthat could be linked to the individual were subjectedto legal analysis to determine if they prohibitedpossession of firearms under federal law.   btw its worth noting that the n sample group they ended up with is going to some arguable extent skewed in much the same way that a prison inmate survey is skewed  ie its a survey of the people who got caught.  this means that at some level the pop surveyed is probably less careful less smart than the ones who didnt get caught are still out there and are successfully avoiding detection.  in the case of the MAIG  it means that this is the group who werent smart enough to not post any identifying info in their ads like your real name plus year of birth gmail.com for example or a listed land line phone number thats in your name.so what this means then is that whatever  of this smaller subset of all posters is prohibited its seems more likely than not that the total  of prohibited buyers using Armslist overall is higher than . since youre adding in all the smarter criminals to the equation smart enough to at least whip up a dummy gmail address or a burner cell phone number for their Armslist transactions.  its also probably a fair statement that as you go higher up the list in terms of criminals we should really be concerned with these criminals knowledge of their need to cover their tracks is probably also going to increase.  ie theyll become less and less likely to be discoverable in a subsection such as MAIGs .  for these reasons readers of the MAIG Armslist study should keep in mind that that . is the bare minimum for which the study can make a rigorous claim about.  so its very reasonable to conclude that actually the bottom line finding should be thought of as somewhere greater than ..  this also gets to something called the DunningKruger Effect.  the DKE says that the less competent and knowledgeable you are about something the greater your tendency to act like you understand it.  but the more knowledgeable you are about something the more apt you are to stop and take into momentary consideration the opposing viewpoint of others just to make doubletriple sure youre in fact being as careful about what you think you know as you think you are being.  from a social perspective one of the distortions caused by the DKE is that ignorant people radiate confidence and people who actually do know exactly what theyre talking about tend to radiate uncertainty.  this means that when the two join in a debate a casual observer is quite likely to be impressed with the ignorant persons passion and think that they must be the smartknowledgeable one instead of the nerdy professor type.  this phenomenon is also magnified by the format of todays news consumption.  the typical interaction on this stuff being seen by  the typical audience member these days is likely to be somebody watching a cable news backandforth between two contestants hosted by the news guy.  the format is quickie sound bytes and its compressed into a short enough time spot that you can make unsupportable claims and nobody has enough time to point out that the claim is known to be bogus.  and in closing Bill i think its obvious that the Earth is hollow and full of Molemen.  worldrenowned geologist guy opens his mouth to respond but its time to cut to commercial.  and when they return these two guests are gone and theyve moved on to the next story.  how this plays out in the gun reg debate is that honest careful researchers draw conclusions from their research but because theyre careful theyre too careful to overstate their findings.  they only make the strongest claim that can be rigorously supported.  but theres no law of nature which forces the other side to be similarly rigorous.  the other side is free to say well i just think that that number doesnt look right to me so until you can show me a big giant whopping number thats triplegold plated and reproduced by  other independent researchers at great expense im just going to ignore your findings and whatever they might mean.  and this is also why its currently the case that honest careful researchers wont tell you that slamdunk evidence exists either way on the basic question of whether or not more guns  more or less crime.  the answer is probably that the question itself is illformed  more guns probably mean more crime in dense urban settings but probably dont mean anything in lowdensity small town or rural settings.  which is another part of the problem in the debate that whatever the representatives of the two sides say on the TV their respective audiences then go jump onto Reddit or whatever and immediately begin talking past each other because one of them lives in Small Town Red State USA and the other in Large Metro Area Blue State USA.  and they dont visit each other very often and they dont really care what the differences are they just want to be able to govern themselves in their own place the way they want.  and both audiences perceive the other one as proxy warriors for an invading political threat to their ability to do this.  and you know what?  they probably are since its become pretty obvious that having a checkerboard pattern of gun laws across the lower  means that criminals dont have to drive very far to get a gun and bring it back home to their strict gun law hometown to commit their crimes.  were probably not going to see mile fences and guard towers and checkpoint charlies between Ohio and Pennsylvania any time soon so this interstate crime gun travel thing is a real issue and that means federal rulemaking is probably the only viable solution.  if all  contiguous states passed a more or less uniform UBC requirement that would probably do it.  and while the trend seems at least somewhat in this direction at the moment with CO and OR enacting UBCs its anybodys guess what other states will follow suit if any.  and even if you just ended up with like  holdout states fairly evenly dispersed around the continent that keeps the problem alive.  so a federal UBC is most likely the only viable way to do it in a way that plugs all the holes.  and btw yes if a federal UBC passed and criminals suddenly were denied the private gun aftermarket there probably would be some sort of uptick in straw purchases and thefts.  this is inevitable.  but both straw purchases and thefts are better than private sales as far as tracking down the parties involved later on and punishing them.  and advertising this punishment will serve as an effective deterrent to many future wouldbe straw purchasers who are asked by an associate to buy for them and thereby commit a crime and assume the risk of being caught and given a harsh punishment for breaking the law.  we know we cant somehow physically prevent people from committing crimes.  you cant physically prevent the possibility of people beating each other to death in their living rooms.  but we can and do effectively deter a whole lot of criminal activity simply by frequently reminding each other of the terrible punishment thats in store for us if we do it and get caught.  and yes most criminals worry about getting caught.  they dont like prison any more than we do.  but just because theres also that small subset of complete lunatics who dont seem to care about anything doesnt mean that we just say meh laws dont work on that small lunatic subset so i guess well just abandon all rulemaking oriented solutions to the problem.  thats completely irrational to say that and it indicates a combination of an ulterior motive and a willful ignorance towards the issue.

5646007,0,t1_cwwq6fr,gt The conclusions dont necessarily meet with the results. Because they say that there are roughly half as many DGUs as there are Hostile gun usages. Which if you take into account that roughly half of the respondents own firearms. So basically if you have a given population everyone has the possibility of having a hostile gun usage however only those that own firearms have the possibility to perform a DGU.  im not sure what exactly your criticism here is.  you seem to have a problem with the existence of this reason that HGUs would likely outnumber DGUs but you arent disagreeing with that reason or giving any other indication for why citing reasons in general for why HGU gt DGU makes the conclusion that HGU gt DGU an incorrect conclusion.  all the authors are concluding is that HGU gt DGU.  do you disagree?  you appear to from your first line about the conclusions not meeting the results.  but then you dont directly disagree with their results ie respondent data.  and since their conclusion that HGU gt DGU is simply a succinct statement of the data im not sure exactly how youre disagreeing with the conclusions.  you dont appear to like them but i cant tell what part of them you think are faulty.  gt  They say that they also included DGU stories as Hostile gun usages if the person was defending themselves from someone with a firearm. So it is statistical double dipping to count DGUs also as Hostile gun usage because of the situation the DGU is placed in.  Im not sure what doubledipping means here.  The goal of the survey was to estimate the relative amounts of DGU vs HGU.  in some incidents both parties have a gun in some just the defender and in some just the aggressor.  but where both have a gun this should be counted as both a DGU and an HGU.  im not sure how else you would count them.  should the authors have simply ignored all HGU when it was met with DGU?  this wouldnt make sense considering what the study was trying to count.  also over half of the situations characterized as defensive by the respondents were deemed by the panel of judges to have likely not been characterized this way under the law.  and if a use isnt defensive then its offensive and should be classified accordingly.  ,gunpolitics,cwwxwsr,-1,t5_2sumr

5728943,0,t1_cx73pbi,gt what right in particular do you feel that registries impinge upon?   My concern isnt so much about the rights the registry itself may impinge upon. Its the fact that the existence of a national registry like this enables even invites almost limitless possibilities for the application of future gun control laws and restrictions. It will make it easier for the government to evaluate where the legally owned guns are what types there are and which lawabiding citizens have them. They can use this information to come up with all sorts of halfbaked schemes for preemptive moves to allegedly prevent gun violence. They can harass individuals who own more than a certain number of guns or put them on extra special watch lists for further scrutiny and harassment even though they have broken NO law.  As they inevitably attempt to roll out further restrictions on magazine capacity and folding stocks and militarystyle features they will have a nice little shopping list so they can start sending out nasty official letters to people demanding they turn in their  round magazines and their rifles with barrel shrouds before a certain date. People who dont comply can be further harassed and expect a nice little Ruby Ridge style visit from the FBI.  A registry directly targets the people who ARE obeying the law. Criminals arent going to voluntarily register their weapons. If a criminal steals my weapon and uses it in a crime and the police can then track it back to me what good is that? Im innocent. Perhaps a person who is shot by a criminal using my gun can then sue me for damages though because I didnt have my gun disassembled in an underground bank vault in a separate room from my ammunition when the criminal broke into MY house and stole it.  Besides if a gun is stolen from me I have the choice to file a police report then there is a record of it anyway no registry required.  As a person who owns guns I see no benefit in this for me only problems. As a citizen who wants to see less gun crime I see little benefit either. Criminals will not register their guns whether its one of the  million guns already in the U.S. or guns smuggled in from elsewhere. If a criminal steals my gun they arent going to email the ATF and say Hey guys go ahead and update your registry. I am now the owner of this gun. Gotta go rob a liquor store now. OK thnks bye!.  A registry will do far more to inconvenience and persecute the law abiding citizens who comply with it than the criminals who dont. Further I can see absolutely no reason to assume it would have any meaningful impact on gun violence. gt most of us recognize that informational disclosures can be damaging. at the same time we also recognize that sometimes not disclosing damaging information about yourself amounts to fraud.  My not providing the government with an inventory of any firearms and ammunition I might own does not constitute anything remotely like fraud in my mind. At least not unless they require it by law and leave something off the list. Probably safer just not to have the list at all. That way I can be sure a clerical error wont make me guilty of fraud because I didnt tell Big Brother I have  magazines for my pistol instead of .  gt so the cost to the gun owner of having his guns registered excludes any implications to reputation danger of robbery etc since the list isnt open to public scrutiny.  That wasnt really my concern. Im not so much worried about having my guns stolen. I can buy more guns. Theres insurance coverage for things like this.  Im far more concerned about having my rights stolen.  gt so what is the downside cost of having a federal agency know something and nobody else? this question is unclear. people who fear and distrust the federal government assume the worst with gun registries and this fear usually takes the form of some future moment when we all go down the Slippery Slope of UKstyle gun regulation. while this is not impossible it is very unlikely to occur any time soon.  Assurances that its unlikely to occur anytime soon are not good enough sorry. Above I also listed several more consequences to gun owners if a registry is created. The potential threat to the future of our rights outweighs the weak case for any kind of crime prevention that this is allegedly going to result in. The fact is that gun related crime over all is down in this country over a  year period. The only reason we are having this conversation is because of the recent uptick in high profile mass shootings which are especially shocking to people. The forces for gun control which have been here all along are missing no opportunity to exploit every one of these tragedies to push their agenda and get the public worked up into a frenzy of paranoia. A gun registry is highly unlikely to have prevented ANY of the mass shootings and thats what everyone is so anxious about. We can pretend they are worried about the poor inner city drug dealer victims but we all know if we went through an entire year without another socially maladjusted idiot shooting up a school in a white neighborhood it would be the worst thing in the world for the gun control movement.  of the overnight internet SJWs who popped up like mushrooms after Sandy Hook would fade away. It has nothing to do with actually reducing crime or even substantially reducing the number of people killed by guns every year. It has everything to do with anxious upper middle class suburban moms imagining that their child is going to be shot at school because they saw it happen somewhere else. They and the rest of the SJWs who have jumped on the train are worked up in such a lather about this understandably that they are desperate to SOMETHING..ANYTHING so they can feel less helpless. I get it. The problem is theres very little objectivity or careful thought being applied here. Not too much time considering whether or not something would actually be effective at all at preventing these types of tragedies. People just feel like they need to do something. Some people resent gun culture as a whole and hold all gun owners partially responsible and if these new laws and regulations act to punish those people all the better.  If they calmed their tits for a minute and stepped back for a moment to look at each of these events carefully however they might get a clearer picture of what types of actions would be the most likely to actually prevent them. Its not registries. Its not bans on assault weapons. The problem is and has always been sick individuals driven to murder for some reason. Is anyone going to ask WHY? How is that not the first question? How is that not the thing getting the most attention? Go ahead ban ALL the guns. The crazy guy only needs ONE gun to shoot your kids.

5904648,0,t3_3w5g6j,i ran some numbers too.  mine were on gun murders vs nongun murders in OECD countries.  i arranged the countries by nongun murder rate in blue then stacked the gun murder rate on top of that in red.  the results are interesting  the four big Englishspeaking countriesUS UK Australia Canadaare all bunched up together near the middle. and all four are pretty close in nongun murders a little above or a little below ..  but then notice the big red spike represented by the US a country with easy access to guns.  in the US about  of all murders are gun murders.  then notice the red portions on the other three  UK with almost no gun ownership is tiny.  AUS with low gun ownership is also very small.  CAN with significant gun ownership around  of households but also with significantly stricter laws than the US such as mandatory registration of all handguns since the s has a larger red portion than the other two but still only like  the USs rate per capita.  the clear takeaway from this comparison is that stricter gun laws tend to produce lower rates of gun murderand thus of murder period.  in principle we can take this as far as the courts will allow but either way well get out what we put in.  chart     note  the objection might be raised here that i am making the assumption that all or most of the USs gun murders would not simply convert to nongun murders if the assailants had no gun.  and yes i am making that assumption.  but if you break violent crime down into categories and compare them you will find nothing anywhere near the variance you see between the gun murder rates.  this has been exhaustively studied between the US and the UK.  the results show that US and UK are very much in line with each other on all the major categories of violent crime.  the only big difference being homicide and breaking out that stat by gun vs nongun the only difference is the gun homicides.  so since US and UK are very similar on all other violent crimes and on nongun homicide as well i think its safe to say that no our gun murders would not simply convert to nongun if no access to guns.  the opposite way to say this would be since US and UK are both similar on rates of rape robbery assault etc it would be a very surprising result if Americans mysteriously ended up murdering each other x as often as Brits did even without easy access to guns.  ,gunpolitics,cxtmsx3,-12,t5_2sumr

6050675,0,t1_cychrvt,gtis it vague and subjective to say that getting into a car and driving off when you are staggering drunk is dangerous?No it is not.. just as you are saying. But you are still missing the difference in the rest of post and confusing what the courts are saying about it. Getting into a car and driving drunk is an action someone is taking which most likely will have a negative outcome. If you are caught you cannot claim property rights or any other such thing as right to justify your action of driving drunk or impaired in any other way. These laws are best described as a postaction. If you do X then you cannot claim Y and will be convicted of at least Z unless you actually hurt someone then it is assaultmurderetc.BUT....It seems you are attempting to apply that same set of cases to preemptive laws which if we did the scenario would be more like Because the ability exists for you to potentially some day get drunk and drive and we have seen that some people have ignored our other laws the only way for us to solve this issue is that we are now  preventing sales of cars to individuals.This example is no longer a law based on someone actually doing something and being prosecuted for their actions. Now it is a restriction on everyone regardless of what they have or have not done based on the actions of others. The law is an attempt at prevention of an unknown future event.And that is the difference in what you are trying to say in your Fire in the theater quote. The case you cited have said that you cannot use the First Amendment as a defense post action though that specifically ruling was overturned because it applied to a different situation pamphlets protesting the war. Will the courts most likely uphold the Fire in a theater portion...possibly but it isnt something likely to get there on its own.If we are to apply what you are trying to say about these types of laws then the preemptive law would be because you have the potential to yell fire in a crowded movie theater we are all required to wear tape over our mouths or another form of vocal cord restraint while in the movie theater. This prevents the possibility of someone ignoring our restriction.Are you seeing the difference in the types of laws and their application?Because you saidgt essentially foreclosing an activity based on a probablistic determination of the odds of a future outcome. Which the way you are arguing it the law is not doing. Foreclosing the activity does not prevent the activity from the begining. It prevents the activities most likely outcome by stopping the action after it starts. However it requires the person to actually being the action of driving under the influence which statistically most actions end badly. ,gunpolitics,cycqv7f,2,t5_2sumr

You take the red pill  you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbithole goes.The founding fathers and indeed anyone who gives two shits about the workings of our country would not have let things gotten as out of hand as they have.  When I say out of hand I mean government regulation that does not have the best interest of the people in mind.  Both an EPA and FDA controlled by the very corporations it was designed to regulate big business influencing politics private donors backing candidates only to turn around and benefit from the legislation their candidates enact.gt wait a second when are people going to go against the government and change things.It takes people standing up.  Im heavily involved at the grassroots level with multiple organizations.  We are fighting enemies such as Bloomberg who personally bankrolls millions into multiple efforts against the Second Amendment.  Everytown for one Moms Demand Action is another.  Most recently they have rolled out a campaign to target women in an attempt to turn them against men who believe in the nd.  Sounds crazy right?  HuffPo and Cosmo have both engaged with the attempt to try and make the perjorative term gunsplainer stick in the public vocabulary.At its core what Bloomberg is doing is manipulating a massive PsyOp against the constitution.  Why do I care so much? Am I some crazy gun nut in a cabin in the woods?  Well yes but that is beside the point.  The bottom line is the nd protects the rest.  The constitution is just a piece of paper but the nd amendment gives it teeth.Consider the Black Lives Matter movement.  These guys have a right to be angry they have been the victim of a system which is designed to work against them.  They attempted to band together but due to poor leadership and misguided members it devolved into rioting looting and a black eye for the black community.  Imagine how different it would have been had they utilized the first amendment to form organized peaceful protests and to lobby their leadership for change.  Now imagine they were legally gathered but a tyrannical government chose to pepper spray them into submission and silence.  Do you think that would have happened if the protesters were armed?  I dont personally agree with either the Bundy Ranch or Oregon Standoff but when people are well organized and sufficiently armed the government listens as opposed to steamrolling.  Hell heres evidence of a polite and civil discussion between the leader of the Oregon Standoff and the FBI.  A far cry from the streets of Ferguson.The founding fathers would have exhausted every avenue for change only resorting to violence as a last resort.  American democracy is a fantastic system when used by an informed populace.

Sure with a polymer gun you can embed a RFID tag into the frame.  A tag readable over distance would likely be fairly large but lets ignore that.  All criminals need to know is where the tag is tear apart one gun and you know where it is in every other same model gun.  Your billion dollar gun tracking system is defeated by a guy with a cordless drill.  You cant really embed a tag in a steel frame.  So itd have to be even more accessible and thus easy to remove.  And this ignores the fact that theres about  million untagged guns out there.  Even if you mail an RFID sticker to every gun owner Im pretty sure the criminals wont tag their guns.  And lets say police guns had special tags.  Theyd be targets for theft as theyd give legitimacy to whoever owned one allowing the criminal to walk into the store unchallenged.  Of course you can work around that with live database queries so the officer can report the gun stolen and in doing so you create a privacy nightmare in that the movements of every gun and by association their owners are now being tracked by where the database queries are coming from.  And that will create a lawsuit.  The plaintiff will correctly argue that the exercise of a Constitutionallyprotected freedom should not require a citizen to sacrifice their right to privacy.  And once weve spent billions RFIDtagging every gun and installing RFID scanners on every door to every convenience store and office building and what not none of it will do a damn bit of good because the criminal will be in and out of the convenience store before the clerk has time to react to the blinking red light.  ,gunpolitics,d08k9l4,20,t5_2sumr

7566411,0,t1_d31imf2,i saw your edit clarifying that you were distinguishing between what you call the Constitution proper and the Bill of Rights.  i have to confess im pretty confused by this.  before you joined the conversation uFOPTY and i were going back and forth about things and he said  gtI didnt realize that the possession and use of airplanes was a codified human right enumerated in the Constitution. Please cite the passage where this right is listed...   obviously theres no codified human right enumerated anywhere that i know of that specifically centers around airplanes.  but as was the tone of the exchange since he was playing pretty fast and loose with terms here i gamely decided to give as good as i got.  so i suggested that since airplanes can certainly be property they fall under property rights.  and that the idea of property rights are clearly a codified human right enumerated by the USC.  not to mention a much more ancient and fundamental thing to stake claims to than say courtappointed attorneys.  so this was the context in which property had arisen in the thread.  at which point you suggested property wasnt mentioned by USC then i protested by pointing out the A and finally you clarified by adding an edit distinguishing the following  gtnowhere in the text of the constitution edit the Constitution proper that is the Amendments use it twice in the context of deprivation without due process is the word property used in the sense you described.ill begin by saying that youre the first commentator anywhere who ive ever heard distinguish between the USC and the Bill of Rights in this way.  the BoR are indeed amendments and as such are always placed after the main body of the original document when it is published.  but ive never heard anybody imply that the BoR is somehow secondary to the preceding portions of the USC.  on the contrary the BoR is quite revered among the portions of the USC.  while the main body of the USC is essentially a procedural administrative document laying out the basic structure of the new govt the BoR is the part that protects citizens from that new govt.  it also happens to contain the A btw a relevant fact to any rGP thread. therefore if one was going to discuss individual rights specifically called out such as private property rights then the BoR is the first place youd look in our founding docs.  and the fact that the more procedural more structural main body of the USC doesnt discuss private property protections against state claims seems nothing if not proper and completely expected.  gt However it is unclear whether Jefferson in drafting the Constitution meant property to be included sources do not agree.   the man who more than anyone else is associated with the drafting of our constitution was not Jefferson but Madison.  Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence which contains the phrase you have in mind.  but the DoI for all its unique cultural philosophical and literary significance doesnt provide fuckall to a discussion about where the best balance points are for how to regulate firearms.  which doesnt detract from or insult the document in any way.  not any more than it would to observe that the Holy Bible isnt so useful if one needs direction on how to fix a series KW Sears washing machine.  rFOPTY has staked out this extreme position whereby he steadfastly holds to the view that somehow the A banishes any hope of legitimately regulating any form of weapon a person might wish to own and use.  this position is both ignorant and stupid.  its ignorant because colonial Americans were regulating firearms long before shots rang out at Lexington and Concorde and their British forebears did so back in England long before that.  so this view then that somehow there was this foundational rejection of any weapon regulation anywhere in the New World is nothing more than a petulantly intentional misread of history.  and its stupid for all same reasons it was stupid in  or   because firearms are really fucking dangerous.  that hasnt changed and they knew this back then as well.  so depending on the situation theyd make rules for themselves about how they could be kept and used.  and importantly then as now regulating guns tended to be done primarily in the cities and much less in the countryside.  guns have always been regulated in the New World since long before we became a country.  any assertion to the contrary is bullshit and should be called out for exactly what it is.  the A doesnt say govt cannot regulate guns whatsoever.  and whatever the founders intended it to mean it currently means only one significant thing  that govt cannot deprive you of a usable handgun in the home.  thats it.  any problems with that go visit the Supreme Court and theyll explain it to you.  any problem with what they say and you can go visit the FBI.  i guarantee theyll explain it more directly than the Courts.  as all those Bundy Family dickweeds are finding out here one by one.   ,gunpolitics,d329izw,2,t5_2sumr

Those that possess magazines capable of holding more than  rounds may keep them however they may not be transferred to another person. If they choose to they may sell the magazines to the ATF for a price of  each. The purchase period by the ATF will last for  years after which any magazines over  rounds will be turned over to the ATF upon the owners death.You can change out mags pretty quickly right? I would be more a  round internal mag that takes time to reload. This would however make guns like the AR illegal so gunners would lose their cookies over this one. gt All state and local firearms bans will be null and void. This includes handgun and so called assault weapons bans.Federally mandated right? Isnt that already in the Constitution? How about universal reciprocity on CC? gt Handgun licenses will no longer be required by any state. A person that may legally possess a firearm may purchase open carry or carry concealed a handgun in any state or jurisdiction.OK. gt Suppressors aka silencers will be removed from the NFA.

By stating that this right should not be infringed by the government implies that there exists some valid and necessary conditions where they will be used but does not even remotely imply that all uses are valid. Thus restricting celebratory gunfire isnt a restriction on the rights protected by the nd which is how youre apparently trying to argue we must believe for logical consistency.Self defense and escape from danger has always been assumed to be a valid defense for reasonable actions that would normally be illegal even if there is no explicit provision.

The point shes making regards the characterization she provides high capacity rapid firing rifles.The costs of enforcement would not be predicted to increase substantially since the infrastructure is pre existing. The cost of legislating is static. You are still completely misunderstanding and misusing statistical significance.  Any value less than  is not a statistical insignificance.  Statistical significance refers to probability.  It is the probability that a result is not due to chance.  For instance a recent study measured the improvement of lung function following administration of a drug. Only  patients improved.  However the sample size was large enough to demonstrate that the chance the result was due to chance alone was less than .  Hence it was statistically significant.  The significance is not the size of the result its the accuracy of the measurement. This last paragraph except the first sentence is almost a good argument.

Plenty of people are denied the right to own a gun therefore in practical effect gun ownership is a privilege.  Children for instance do not have right to own a gun.  Neither do people who are prohibited by law from owning a gun.  Also there is no right to possess a gun in a large number of places.  For instance on private property where you do not have permission.  Or on public property where it is prohibited by law.  Also the privilege of gun ownership is revocable with due process of law.

The Republicans tried to pass this measure a few months ago the Dems staged a sit in on the floor.As to his comment about the NRAs line he is right as an individual.

Until that changes and their honestly can be confirmed all new restrictions need to be denied because it is a very slippery slope. It is not a good situation and unfortunately a few more bad people might more easily get guns than otherwise would but the antigunners created this climate.,gunpolitics,d78awgj,9,t5_2sumr

But off the record makes more sense in this context.Fact is we have no idea what is said in nearly all conversations had by politicians. They are not recorded the agenda is almost never public information. And why should it be? If a transcript of every conversation with politicians was public record no one would speak their mind especially not bankers. They would be too afraid of pissing off their clients or moving markets.And like it or not Wall Street is going to be involved in almost every matter of commerce. Thats how all capitalist economies have worked since the th century. They play a hugely important role in allocating capital and facilitating financial transactions. You dont help the working class by ignoring banks. Listening to what bankers have to say is critical to make informed decisions about the economy. Just because someone has had conversations with bankers or considers their perspective doesnt mean they will prioritize the interests of the banks over the interests of everyone else. Politicians take a lot of meetings with organized labor too.

9133359,0,t1_d88f4sc,gt But private ownership of guns is far more heavily regulated than private ownership of carswhen we draw analogies between gun regs and car regs for these analogies to have any meaning we must assume that the item in question is going to be used for its intended purpose in the typical way that people use it.  for hunting and recreational uses this will typically entail firing the gun.  but for selfdefense uses it typically will not.  Dick Heller wanted to use his handgun in a meaningful way in his home meaning he wanted to be able to have it at the ready in case he got broken into.  so the act of keeping a loaded handgun in the nightstand for example is a use of the gun.  in the case of the car the typical way it is used is to get around on public roadways.  while of course its certainly possible to purchase a car flatbed it directly to your property and then never drive it off your property after that...this situation describes almost nobodys intended use of the car they own.  having established that we now ask the question of which item gun vs car appears to be more heavily regulated.  just driving to the store and back one sees enough evidence to support the contention that there is probably no activity that the avg American engages in that is more heavily regulated and in more ways than driving.  theres a sign every  feet telling you to do this or not do that with your car.  driving is endlessly regulated in so many ways that its impossible to even conceive of counting the number of specific regulations that involve cars.  with guns the most heavily regulated use is clearly going to be public carryccw.  and where you can and cant bring your gun is in play basically wherever you go in public so in that regard i suppose you can make a certain argument for ccw being kind of a tie with driving.  although ccw regs certainly dont come anywhere near the complexity of driving regs but whatever.  but thats just for ccw and the  of Americans who routinely ccw is far smaller than who routinely drive.  its likely something like  vs  maybe.  its hard to say what  of ccw permit holders actually routinely carry.  its almost certainly less than half of the  or so who have active permits so  is probably a fair estimate.  its extremely unlikely to be a gross undercount in any case.  so weve got  of Americans who routinely ccw versus a big majority who routinely drive and lets go ahead and allow as above that these are equally regulated activities.  all other gun uses though are far less regulated than driving.  even hunting which is a public gun use is less so.  once you have your hunting license youre off tromping around in the woods.  and while regs apply to some things you can and cant do while hunting youre not passing by a posted sign every  feet announcing this or that reg on your activity.  and then theres nonpublic gun use.  which is basically keeping a gun in the home for selfdefense.  this activity has far less regs attached than driving.  even at the purchasing stage where both items regs require registration of ownership and yes  forms are registering the item to its owner.  the registration information just doesnt happen to be collected into a database but registration  database of registrations...even at this stage the paperwork involved in buying a gun at the store is less than for buying a car.  overall then i think its pretty clear that driving involves far more regulation than guns do.  its not even close really.  so your assertion to the contrary seems wholly unsupported.  ,gunpolitics,d89pwep,-1,t5_2sumr

9945557,0,t1_db3qric,re attacking gun rights  there is currently only one recognized individual gun right in the United States and that is the right to a usable handgun in the home aka the Heller right.  no govt in the US may restrict gun use below this baseline and to my knowledge none are currently trying to do so.  therefore strictly speaking there are no states which are attacking gun rights.  but of course this is the gun debate and progun participants rarely restrict their language to pesky obstacles like court decisions.  so i know i can take your meaning of gun rights here to mean something like what i wish the gun laws were.  which is fine since thats what the gun debate is about its about gun laws.  and naturally each side always wants to employ the strongest language it can get away with in the service of its goal.  but to be clear Activity X allowed by law in my area does not equal my Activity X rights.  in virtually any Activity X case you could name the amount of it allowed by law will exceed the amount which the govt is required to allow by the courts.  so if were arguing over for example a proposal to limit the number of handguns a person can buy in a day period this isnt an argument over gun rights its just an argument over how far past the mandated minimum level of the activity the laws will allow.  so if the proposal is defeated and individuals retain the ability to legally purchase an unlimited number of handguns whenever they wish that doesnt mean that that ability is a right its just allowed by law.   reason being that owning say  handguns vs only  handguns obviously doesnt affect ones ability to exercise ones right to a usable handgun in the home.  which can be said to be ones right.  but acquiring even more handguns that you currently own adds nothing to the exercise of this right and thus decreasing the rate at which current handgun owners can acquire more of them amounts to no obstacle to the right.   ,gunpolitics,db3xiw7,-4,t5_2sumr

Why wouldnt they come to the table to agree on some kind of compromise? They could have avoided a lengthy and ultimately losing court battle by replacing the ban with a tough permit system like MA NYC or NJ has.

10536444,0,t1_dd26b5i,Its actually made quite clear in  CFR .gt A person who uses a controlled substance and has lost the power of selfcontrol with reference to the use of controlled substance and any person who is a current user of a controlled substance in a manner other than as prescribed by a licensed physician. Such use is not limited to the use of drugs on a particular day or within a matter of days or weeks before but rather that the unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct. A person may be an unlawful current user of a controlled substance even though the substance is not being used at the precise time the person seeks to acquire a firearm or receives or possesses a firearm. An inference of current use may be drawn from evidence of a recent use or possession of a controlled substance or a pattern of use or possession that reasonably covers the present time e.g. a conviction for use or possession of a controlled substance within the past year multiple arrests for such offenses within the past  years if the most recent arrest occurred within the past year or persons found through a drug test to use a controlled substance unlawfully provided that the test was administered within the past year.

10902839,0,t1_de4jl7a,Thats a good question.This is the article you should read.In essence we have a pretty damn good idea of where and how criminals are acquiring guns. Its mostly corrupt gun dealers. Theres very little the federal government does to investigate these corrupt gun dealers even after theyve identified who they are. Meanwhile at the State level in Oregon theres no initiative what so ever to go after bad gun dealers. Ive even filed complaints about a dealer here in my town that I witnessed selling guns to people who were clearly criminals that gun store is still in business. All of those gang bangers tell their criminal buddies about this store and suddenly the store get a big influx of criminal buyers.An analogy would be a bar or night club that doesnt card for underage patrons. As soon as the local high schoolers find out every kid in the area will be there. We need to shut that bar down.The one trick is to go after bad gun dealers just as wed shut down a bar that serves alcohol irresponsibly. If we knew that  of bars caused the majority of DUIIs wed shut those down right away for public safety reasons. But instead our politicians are taking money from a guy in New York if they say If we want to eliminate DUIIs we need to sell alcohol in glasses that are square! No more round pint glasses!

Are you considering only the I bought it and put it in my nightstand then forgot about it crowd? Because theyre kinda the ones that every serious gun owner wishes didnt exist too.gt mm handgun ammo is cheaper than MSR ammo. Good defensive ammo for mm is about as or more expensive than surplus . that will do a better job anyway. If youre talking target ball sure your statement is true...but then thats not for defensive use so maybe it should be banned huh?gt sounds fun but irrelevant to this discussion. Au contraire. Adding a reddot that makes it faster to put on target than a pistol is entirely relevant to a conversation about defensive use. Not to mention ergonomics to make it more comfortable for a person of abnormally large or small stature the same ones who often have complaints about handguns and little recourse due to inherent limitations of pistol design.Handguns are good for defense because you can carry one concealed easily. If youre defending your home a short rifle or carbine actually is much better. Ive got numerous pistols and yes I use a couple of them for CC with some regularity. Which one is generally a matter of clothing constraints. They are not what would be used for home defense because Ive got something that handles just as well is easier to put on target and outperforms in literally every way.,gunpolitics,de967bs,5,t5_2sumr

There are all very different sociological challenges with very different solutions. When people come to understand each of them theyll understand theres different solutions. Meanwhile politicians overlap these different problem package them as one issue and offer solutions to a specific problem. I.e. banning high capacity magazines or assault rifles  that solution doesnt make any sense to reduce suicides or criminal gun violence.The topic of mass shooting as an example well see that a lot of the folks motivated to do mass shootings specifically cite that they want the celebrity status. Fixing our news reporting of mass shooting alone could reduce them. In fact we did that already with suicides and new reporting as journalists learned that reporting suicides causes suicides so its socially taboo to report cause of death if there was a suicide. ,gunpolitics,del5qgn,1,t5_2sumr

Its up to those in power to apply laws judiciously and not misuse their power and its the civic duty of the people to demand that their leaders show such restraint. I totally get the slippery slope argument. But just because a law might be misused doesnt mean its a bad law. Let me give you a historical example. The Governor of a state may mobilize their militia to put down civil unrest and rioting. This is a right of the states under the Constitution. It is a good necessary law that has been used in many times and places to protect the rule of law and ensure a peaceful society. On the other hand it has been used by governors to break peaceful strikes by literally executing strikers. It has been used to crush peaceful protests and political dissent. The state militias are ultimately The jackbooted thugs that DontTreadOnMe libertarians fear. It is my belief that the law as it stands and is utilized now is not a bad thing. I dont see the practice changing much anytime soon and there are much more pressing concerns to freedom in the State of Texas. ,gunpolitics,dexqhy5,1,t5_2sumr
