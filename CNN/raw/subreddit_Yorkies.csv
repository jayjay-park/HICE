4896681,0,t3_3hygj8,Is there any chance he could have a urinary tract infection? My yorkie regressed on his training last year was peeing frequently and in the house and ended up having a uti. The only thing that tipped me off was that his pee started smelling bad but thats not always the case. Once we treated him it only took a little bit to get him back on track. ,Yorkies,cubrkgt,2,t5_2t2gt

9661784,0,t3_5dcgyd,It is rather difficult to tell from one picture.  I am also no expert I just own a pedigree yorkie myself. Everthing looks right to me except for the ears. They seem to be too big and they dont seem to be the right shape I also cant tell how long the snout is from the picture.  Honestly I dont think he is a pedigree but I could be so wrong but I really dont think it matters. He is beautiul nontheless. He looks healthy and happy  hope you enjoy every moment with him. ,Yorkies,da40mh3,2,t5_2t2gt
