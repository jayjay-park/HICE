868443,0,t3_23hzt0,.I am currently a masters student at Adelaide University doing the double degree Masters of Landscape Architecture and Masters of Planning urban design. Its one extra year to get the masters of planning as opposed to two if you did it by itself but you come out of it a certified planner and thats a pretty handy additional qualification to have when working in landscape architecture from everyone ive talked to planners and LAs Architects..Live in Adelaide not working in LA yet though im hoping to change that by the end of the year I do do work for a small residential Arch firm which I started doing while doing my bachelors. While the job with them isnt exactly the field I want to be in the experience is really valuable as a lot of the skills are transferrable and since both Arch and LA are pretty linked I have established some connections with LA firms through the director of the Arch firm i do work for. Point being Id encourage taking any kind of work from a related field even if its not LA it can still be very valuable..The normal stuff like drafting and all that grunt work but also I get to do a bunch of smaller design projectswork as well as a bunch of d modeling and some physical model making..This is something I am not  on it does seem like LA is fairing a lot better than Arch in South Australia which is positive and there is more work coming from councils and government sometimes in the forms of job tenders for LA firms and sometimes as positions in goverment so thats good. The inside word from what Ive heard is a bit mixed I know of a couple LA firms that are really booming atm and have had to hire a bunch more people but i also know a firm that lost most of their LA team so again the job market seems a bit unpredictable..I would suggest definately getting a masters degree within SA almost every person nowadays trying to break into the profession will have a masters so it would be quite hard to compete with just a bachelors I imagine though I have no experience with wider Australia so I cant comment on that. Also as for Cortheass point about the graduation rates its not something I have particularly noticed in SA the number of LA students here is at most a third of that of Architecture and in my year at least s of the students are from overseas who plan to return to their home countries after graduation so that doesnt leave a lot of grads to compete with here at least.,LandscapeArchitecture,ch2zw5c,1,t5_2s566

1526181,0,t1_cj7k0qc,We received the architectural model from the architect in Rhino and I personally like modeling in Rhino because it is a command basedb very similar to CAD in terms of commandsworkflowRhino also has tons of plugins outstanding support from McNeel and it has Grasshopper.  I personally think Rhino is just as fast as Sketchup for quick modeling.I use ds for Terrain modeling and for rendering.  This is  opinion but I really really loath sketchupi find it very childish unstable and it simply cannot handle large poly models.  ds has so much support both from Autodesk and online tutorials and with ds I have total control of the modeling process.  Graphite modeling tools make terrain modeling easy precise and fast.  Sketchups sandbox tools just cant compete.  In general Ive also found ds to have a much broader range of premade models available and at much higher quality than with sketchup.  Basically my workflow is thisRhino for hard surface modelingImport via .obj to dsds for terrain modeling and imported vegetationRender in vray for ds.Post in Photoshop dodgeburn curves and levels adjustment,LandscapeArchitecture,cj7l17q,1,t5_2s566

5763477,0,t1_cx6747k,I agree. At our office we sub d rendering to a firm in China for pennies compared to the cost to do it ourselves. Their work is exceptional too. ,LandscapeArchitecture,cxbigzw,1,t5_2s566
6641834,0,t1_d06bapl,You sound like a bitter engineer that flunked out of an LA program and had to resort to a boring shitty life as an engineer.  Either that or you failed the LARE miserably.  I will agree that many LAs will get folded into those firms but there will always be LAs and there will be plenty of firms that are LAs only and will hold on to a big part of the market.  Some may go to the AELA firms but many will still go to LA firms because of the culture that is bred into LAs in an engineering firm.  BORING SHIT!  We may be lumped in with yoga instructors and that just shows how ignorant the governor is.  Say you wouldnt happen to be said governor would you?  You are obviously both jackasses.  As far as ASLA goes I cant stand them.  I wouldnt be a member if my boss didnt pay my dues to them.  But thank you for providing some comic relief during my day.  It has been pretty entertaining reading coming from someone who obviously hates landscape architects so much.  Again where as an LA did you fail so miserably?  College exam?  Did your engineering firm get beat out of a big project by an LA firm or can you not stand it that LAs can do everything that civils can do and so much more?  You obviously have a pathetic existence to be trolling the LA subreddit.  ,LandscapeArchitecture,d06bn7i,6,t5_2s566

9337372,0,t1_d8zj3z3,Thank you for the comment. Its quite helpful. You mentioned that therere other problem solving oriented jobs that would hire someone with a landscape background. Could you elaborate on what they are?I do think its a good job that I have. But somehow Im having the worst time doing it. Funnily out of the few classmates of mine who chose to work the ones who got paid near the lower end are pretty happy and those with great salaries including me are miserable. But I think youre right about the stresscounseling thing and Ill definitely try to work on that as well. Again thanks for the advice. ,LandscapeArchitecture,d8zkwnm,1,t5_2s566
