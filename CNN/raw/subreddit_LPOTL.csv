9157823,0,t1_d8c8wdk,Waco isnt one of my favorites but its one of the ones I suggest people start with because it isnt too macabre but is still funny and interesting. Plus it brings the conspiracy theorists side of the show out while still being grounded by facts. The Satanic Government episode does that well too. It seems like it would all be bullshit but almost everything they talk about can be cited and many of these people were convicted looking at you Black Larry King. ,LPOTL,d8ctko4,1,t5_31nfz
