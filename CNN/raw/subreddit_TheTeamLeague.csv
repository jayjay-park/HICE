1622757,0,t1_cjjog1y,gtPersonally I think by Sunday or Monday everyone would have had a chance to get a draft board done but Im fine to start whenever. To add to that because the draft will take a few days you dont need to have your entire draft board done beforehand. We could work on the later rounds while the earlier rounds are taking place.gtI do think there should be some kind of time limit even if it is like hrs just so we dont have anyone who hasnt picked for  days and we have to be like Well we said there was no time limit. That could get frustrating. That sounds reasonable and I could emailPM anyone that still hasnt made their pick by the second day although I really hope it never takes someone more than a few hours to make a pick when its not nighttime.I also want to add that if we make a time limit then if someone goes over that limit wed randomly pick a team for them from all the undrafted teams using random.org. I really hope no one goes over as that could really mess things up. ,TheTeamLeague,cjjppy5,2,t5_32wya
1643072,0,t1_cjm5xp1,I can definitely see that. I would rather have the Bears WRs and RB though so I thought it evened out. But either  theyre both really deep talented teams,TheTeamLeague,cjm9uwc,2,t5_32wya
