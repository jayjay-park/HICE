Competitive means you are in the top   of the applicant pool for your application cycle year so theres no way of knowing exactly what that is since you and everyone else this cycle have not yet applied.  Base it off of last year and the year before.Heres a page from The Ohio State University about presenting a competitive application Heres the class of  stats from Michigan State University ,veterinaryschool,cjkhfh9,2,t5_2wikx

7379641,0,t3_4gezsa,Hello!  I was in the same boat as you for a long time for the same reasons.  Im in vet school now and theres nowhere Id rather be!Before you decide this path though you should go work andor volunteer in veterinary clinics.  Euthanasia is often the most emotionally difficult thing that clinic staff have to deal with but there are many other facets of veterinary medicine that the public rarely sees or knows about.  Working alongside people who are in the profession youre considering and asking their viewpoints on their work will be the best way to decide for yourself if thats the life you want.If you decide that vet tech isnt for you thats okay too  there are many more animalcentric jobs out there that are challenging and fun.  Just go try it out before you decide you want to invest a few years and maybe the rest of your life in the job!,veterinaryschool,d2h0iz8,2,t5_2wikx

11047858,0,t1_deh74xj,Hey sorry for the late response! They monitored your screen and were hooked into your webcam as well. At the beginning of your test they make you show your desk space with the webcam and then use a mirror to show your computer screen to make sure no sticky notes or anything are attached to it. It was super easy! I dont remember how much it cost per session I wanna say somewhere in the  dollar range or so but to me it was worth the convenience of being able to take it anywhere I wanted! ,veterinaryschool,dek97ti,2,t5_2wikx
