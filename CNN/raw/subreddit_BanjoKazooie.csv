This is one of the things Im excited for the most. Im just so happy that this project is a thing. I hope they can get Grant Kirkhope on board for the music to give this game the charm that Banjo and other Rare games had.,BanjoKazooie,coius67,4,t5_2sokv

4279516,0,t1_cs7f7hm,Oh... my... god. Thats brilliant. It would be an EXTREMELY embarrassing blow to Rare and by extension Microsoft but if they actually had the balls to own up to their absolute failures and license away the BanjoKazooie franchise to Playtonic they would make a good decision for once and be met with critical acclaim and a best selling game. Will that ever happen? Almost certainly not but good gods do I ever hope so. Maybe and its a big maybe but if YookaLaylee is as big a success as everyone expects it to be MS will wake up and finally figure out the talent they bought years ago would rather work under payed than under MS and simply license the the IP to them. ,BanjoKazooie,cs80r03,1,t5_2sokv

7005360,0,t3_4bbpjx,People are used to very linear games but Tooie isnt. Unlike Zelda or Portal you dont have to solve a puzzle to continue playing the game which makes it possible for them to make puzzles harder without making people quit from the frustration of getting stuck. Just keep moving on through the levels and go back in the end. I prefer this because I find it refreshing to switch between levels rather than doing it all at once and I like the challenge.,BanjoKazooie,d1aehgr,1,t5_2sokv
7342220,0,t1_d2cookq,Okay first of all you couldnt care less beginning a post by sounding like an imbecile isnt a great start. You told me to shut my mouth because I have no right to tell others what they can think but youre literally sitting there telling me I cant think something LOL oh the irony. Now saying the worlds could have used more content is an incredibly weak argument. Showdown Town has every single thing you just mentioned and is probably one of the best hub worlds ever created in a game. Its filled with content unlockables minigames secrets etc. Its basically an entire games worth of content just in the hub and youre complaining because the game worlds arent brimming with the same stuff? The game worlds are for challenges playing around testing machines etc. If you want the classic banjo feel and a more contentpacked environment then go play around town because that is where the bulk majority of the game content is. Sure they could have added a few things to the worlds to enhance exploration but theyre already giving you hundreds of hours of content are you really petty enough to fault the game because you arent tripping over a useless collectable every  seconds? That sounds like a pretty stupid reason to dismiss the game when it is clearly a fucking masterpiece. Personally I enjoyed have huge open environments to play around in and there was enough content to keep me going for a long time.,BanjoKazooie,d2crdnb,-1,t5_2sokv
7342350,0,t1_d2crdnb,. The fact you point out a common mistake in speech shows the childish reaction you have.. No Im telling you to keep your opinion to yourself unless you can give it in a constructive way and not put someone down by being a cunt. You insulted both OP and I before either of us even gave a chance to give our opinion or thoughts. Youre just being a childish asshole. As Ive stated before the way I see the game is different than your view. And thats fine. My only point has been not to treat people like shit because their opinions differ from yours. But of course you clearly are acting like a child Im done.Enjoy the game I was never trying to prevent that.,BanjoKazooie,d2crws1,3,t5_2sokv

10747245,0,t3_5tm5n5,Highly doubt theres much of a difference between playing on  or Xbox one.  version of nuts amp bolts also has some framerate issues if I remember correctly. Getting rare replay and an Xbox one means you get the previous two banjo games in HDimproved graphics and achievements as well as a bunch of other great games like conkers bad fur day and viva piata. however will be much cheaper so if you can afford going with Xbox one I would go with that. But if youre literally just interested in nuts amp bolts then just go with the  since itll be much cheaper for the exact same game. ,BanjoKazooie,ddohvtm,3,t5_2sokv
