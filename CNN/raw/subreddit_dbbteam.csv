6493808,0,t1_czqr578,Heres the stable this am. I generally dont level anyone until I need them. Warriors and Red got the latest treatment.My defense is Bovus Willow and Rocky.Current pvp team is Bovus Tsume plus two fasts depending on elements needed Willow Torchy Shadow. If my attack takes as long as getting to bovus for a second attack theyve put up a top  defense. Most dont last beyond bovus.  attacks everyone survives. Sometimes if comp targets Willow twice with fasts shell die.Plus I have enough tokens for Icepick Ponti and Lupina but holding off for a full unlock pull.Has Lupina ever shown up anywhere? but the chests? I gather shes meh anyway so Ive just been holding on.,dbbteam,czr0ao9,1,t5_3bcmw
