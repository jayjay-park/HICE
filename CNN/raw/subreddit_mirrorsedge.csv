However if she somehow causes the game to flop it just shows that her intentions are more harmful than what it actually looks like so as cruel as this may sound we should just wait and see if the game flops or not.,mirrorsedge,cmo592f,10,t5_2sfpq

4285636,0,t1_cs8kobc,Ah okay. If I remember correctly the Merc player model was something more or less only there for a scrapped multiplayer. You can find his textures and model when using the map editors material browser. If youre encountering crashing during disarms and melee then its probably trying to refer to scripts that dont exist or the variables dont match. The mod that replaces Faith with the runner cop probably doesnt have this issue due to the fact that the models are both really common and interact the same ways. I could be off base but I think Merc is probably just too incomplete to use in the game.,mirrorsedge,cs8pmu9,1,t5_2sfpq
4293432,0,t1_cs99139,Yeah Callaghan was the sort of heavy lobbied politician that allowed for pk to move in the way they did so it was always there but I would still say that the super in your face way of pasting Gabriel Krueger as the big baddie is more of a way to for lack of a better term cast a wider net. The subtle tones and themes are what attracted a good portion of the main audience to the original game but it probably contributed to it becoming a flop profit wise because lets be honest a majority of gamers only notice a game when they get the flashy in your face direct visuals and story elements. My sincere hope is that they will more use that to draw people in and then sort of tone it down in lue of what made the original great its a long shot but its what I hope will happen.,mirrorsedge,cs9lb8g,2,t5_2sfpq

4308318,0,t3_3abwzz,All those shiny backlit keyboards going completely unused!ampnbsp  Seriously though this brings up my last big worry for the PC version  because it was a BIG flaw in the first game. In ME for consoles you could strafe rightleft with the stick to adjust your path while maintaining full speed. In ME for PC if you used AD to strafe while running you immediately lost all momentum and were instantly dropped to minimum runspeed.This basically meant no strafing on the PC period. Which is a pretty big deal. Granted mouse control was a huge boon over stickaiming but the completely inability to strafe made things incredibly clumsy in places. The ideal solution especially for people with controllerchallenged thumbs like me would be analog stick for movement  mouse for aim. Steam Controller maybe?,mirrorsedge,csb9ufg,6,t5_2sfpq

I made this post to wonder give them a possibility to what theyll do when there are no Enforcers around to shoot you and the melee guards that arent Sentinels cant reach you. Will they just stand there and look stupid? Yet the only enemy type that will shoot you is one carrying an assault rifle yet three guard types are shown with holstered pistolstasers. They should use them for something.  see the first part of above answer. Yes BUT not every guard type is an anti runner. The only ones we know of that are anti runners are Sentinals. Every other guard type is a common cop more or less. How will they attack Faith when shes out of reach? Throw stones? Yell insults? ,mirrorsedge,d1nm3fp,2,t5_2sfpq

7833569,0,t1_d3wjtda,I know exactly what you mean! As for your questions the story so far feels more engaging than the original so Id say its better. However I cant say if its a good one yet in my opinion. Gotta finish it but yes I feel a bit more engaged.There are some points in the story where combat is forced and you have to defeat all the enemies before moving on. It does slow down the pace a bit however it doesnt bother me too much.  It may or may not be something you will enjoy. Architecturewise I vastly prefer the original. Definitely my favorite part of the game. Catalyst looks good too but I find it far more claustrophobic my opinion there are buildings EVERYWHERE and I always feel confined and at some points bizarre. Its hard to explain but it makes a lot less sense to me while playing. I dont feel like Im going building to building things start meshing and I can barely tell where I am. Suddenly Im inside then Im out then somewhere else.  I think this is partially due to the more futuristic architecture being much less familiar than that of the originals. Level design isnt as strong for me and thats probably because of the openworld aspect.But all that said and I dont want to steer you away from it. I am still loving this game despite the negatives I gave. ,mirrorsedge,d3wk7ie,1,t5_2sfpq

7869158,0,t1_d408bey,The combat really works really well if theres no more than two enemies around. Once they force you to fight a mix of four it gets really clunky. The dodgeshift gets really sticky and it becomes messy when youre trying to focus on one enemy but the other three get too close and sometimes you cant see when they get behind you. A more intuitive system wouldve been great like an indicator telling you when offscreen enemies are about to attack you. ,mirrorsedge,d40ke89,2,t5_2sfpq

7887213,0,t3_4naqcn,Normally I could care less about what others think but Im in the same mind as you on this one. I think its because we think of it as an excellent sequel to the first game and just cant understand the way in which people are criticizing the game when it should be celebrated for living up to expectation.I think the problem comes from the game being misunderstood. People think they know what ME is when they obviously dont. They think of ME and the first thing that comes to their minds is the visuals. But they dont remember that at its heart this is a racing game. The whole point is to keep doing the missions and trials over and over again to try and get to the top. So you can imagine my surprise when people criticize Catalyst for being too bland and repetitive devoid of life and empty. They have this unrealistic expectation from a game that never had or promised such elements to begin with. The first game was also bland devoid of life repetitive and had a forgettable story and combat mechanic. Its why the game had mixed reactions when it was first released. But as time when on people realised that none of that mattered because it was a gorgeous looking game that was fun to run through. And so is Catalyst. The game came out yesterday and I already have seven hours logged with most of it being on some of the Dash runs. Its fun addictive beautiful and a pleasure to play  which is exactly what ME was and still is. Im just really hoping that such negative reactions dont affect the sales of the game and any future development of ME related content. I mean Christ EA a company that has an infamous reputation amongst consumers does the unthinkable by funding the sequel to a very niche game for four whole years and this is the reception they receive. Its totally unfair and jeopardizes the potential of seeing less mainstream games like this let alone new IPs in the future. ,mirrorsedge,d42lgei,13,t5_2sfpq

9806791,0,t1_dalngej,anyone could have chosen anything but i was lazy and when i opened my usb stick i saw my screenshot folder i took in mirrors edge chose a nice one and ran with it i also did a post card aswell using all those screenshots i took for another class.opened the photo is photoshop cropped it to  i believe then changed the canvas size to   selected the white space and used fill content aware which was for the sides of the frame that you cant see in the photo as to let the photo extend past the frame blurred it as it could be really weird looking as the computer is just filling in what it things should be there.moved it over to Indesign layed it out correctly with bleed marks and the normal printing stuff and passed it in.im not in the printing course so we didnt get to see how they were printed but id imagine from what i saw we have a printer that youd switch out the paper with this canvas and print them all on one big strip of canvas. which in turns allows you to make massively long prints.we got the picture we cut it built the frame with pre cut wood so we just stuck it together then folded it up after it was stuck to the back of the print.,mirrorsedge,dalwbb4,2,t5_2sfpq

9982567,0,t1_db8olzs,I had meant for the specific game profile. Not globally. Even if its on globally by default it may be turned off for the specific game. Or it might just not have a crossfire profile.,mirrorsedge,db8r92u,5,t5_2sfpq

10180107,0,t1_dbxyvje,Sure they give a quality impression. The Tattoo is printed on paper that is cut in a special fancy way so its not just a lame rectangle. Also you get the Digital version of the book. Worth it? Only you can decide really.,mirrorsedge,dbxyz4f,2,t5_2sfpq
10696582,0,t1_ddj9bfs,Yeah I noticed that as well. I guess it shouldnt matter super much for this test though. Maybe you would push the game to load a little more often pushing down the frame rate a bit if you ran a bit faster but the difference cant be that big.,mirrorsedge,ddj9ty5,1,t5_2sfpq

11023166,0,t3_5xd6vt,Hmm ... a fully open world would be great just my opinion haha but I dont know whether this is possible with the current console gen. Playing as a sentinel as cool as they may look is very unlikely... I mean the story is about faith and the runners and not about krugersec guards. PI think if theres a new mirrors edge in the future please let there be one!!! we will see more of side characters like nomad and birdman new districts in the city of glass glass is actually really huge O.o and maybe even new cities in cascadia omnistat or sabaeus too. God Im getting hyped if I think about the potential the game has!!!Personally I would like to see whats going on at the greylands.SO MUCH TO SEE AND SOO MUCH POTENTIAL! I WANT MORE MIRRORS EDGE!!!,mirrorsedge,dehg275,8,t5_2sfpq
11117530,0,t3_5yq0t3,A piece of advice for laterBe sure to install any custom maps in DocumentsEA GamesMirrors EdgeTdGamePublishedCookedPCMaps  that way you dont have to overwrite any original files and when youre done you just delete the files from there and it will automatically revert to normal. If the game detects any files in the Published folder and subfolders to it it will use them in place of the original file automatically.,mirrorsedge,des5vl9,4,t5_2sfpq
