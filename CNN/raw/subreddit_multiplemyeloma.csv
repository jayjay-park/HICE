2624337,0,t3_2pxne6,First of all Im so sorry about your moms diagnosis. I dont know if youll cry as much as I did in the first few weeks after we found out because Im probably younger than you are but know that I know that it sucks. My dad is a patient at the MM center at UAMS and has been since this summer. Family members who know a lot about medicine looked around and said it was the best place to go for MM. Apparently when Sam Walton the Walmart guy was diagnosed he hired the best doctors that money could buy and started the myeloma center at UAMS. So if its good enough for a billionaire I sure hope its good! My parents cant speak more highly of the place! Dr. Barlogie is brilliant and so funny  he must be  but he still rides a red crotch rocket around. The doctors and nurses are all so nice and knowledgeable and they really care about you. My moms favorite thing about UAMS is how pretty it is inside which sounds silly but it really helps to have a nice atmosphere when you spend all of your time at the infusion clinic! Hospitals are normally so sterile and ugly and white and day after day that gets to you. UALR is pretty inside and its great. My dads favorite thing about it is that each patients treatment plan is so specific to them. They dont just put every patient through the same treatments they consider each patient separately and personalize your treatments to your specific medical needs. And if a treatment doesnt go the way they planned they may change the next treatment to try to account for that. They are very thorough. They have also helped my family tremendously with other resources  both of my parents have had to retire early because of the treatment and the hospital and associated social workers have been so great about helping us with disabilityunemploymentinsurancehousing issues. I wouldnt hesitate to recommend UAMS. I just got back from a visit with my parents there and Ive been feeling down about not getting to go home for Christmas but saying all this really helped me get in a better mood. So thanks for that. Not that I am glad youre going through this by any means! Please feel free to PM me if you need to talk or have ANY more questions. Im not sure if I know how to check my PMs but I will figure it out! I wish you and your mother the best of luck.,multiplemyeloma,cn14ypg,1,t5_2qxcq
