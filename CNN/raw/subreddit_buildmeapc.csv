But you can easily swap it out for an AMD FX plus AM motherboard and save some money and get a larger Hard Drive.On average the core i performs about  better in games than the FX  Source The FX  included here doesnt usually fare better because its extra  cores are hardly ever used by games this is likely to change in the future.PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchant  BenchmarksType|Item|Price||CPU | AMD FX .GHz Core Processor | .

This is because most programs dont use all  cores unless tweaked to do so. AMD is also much cheaper than intel and has good bang for buck but is typically much more power hungry.

1378124,0,t3_29vzu4,The newegg build will perform better in gaming as it has a stronger card. If thats all you want you can leave now if you are interested read on. If you want something a little better for the  budget I would recommend this build instead. This build has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.This build doesnt have the ability to overclock the CPU first and foremost. However if you werent planning on doing that then this will save money and if you were the money may be better spent elsewhere. This processor is the nonoverclockable equivalent. Powerful and will do everything you need. This motherboard doesnt have many bells and whistles but it will do the job. Ram is ramThis is an SSD. These make amazing boot drives as the PC will boot up extremely quickly. Store your OS on this. An alternative is to pay  more and grab a GB SSD and get rid of the mechanical harddrive if you dont need the storage. A decent TB harddrive. The alternative is the larger SSD instead. This card is an absolute beast. The other card is good and if you want to save money go with a X but if not this card will thrash anything you throw at it and it will give you more performance boost than if you overclocked your CPU so switching the money here might be better.This is a good case in a small form factor.

1843297,0,t3_2f4guo,I hate to be the bearer of bad news but there is a reason most people cant recommend anything because for new parts that is a very tight budget.  I think your best bet would be looking for a used rig like you already did.   I dont know what your current casepsu ram situation is  but if you have compatible parts you could probably slowly build a new computer.  If you have an Atx case a w psu and ddr ram I would get a cheap mobo and pentium g. Use the on board Intel graphics until you can find a good deal on a gpu then slowly upgrade everything else. ,buildmeapc,ckbbawr,1,t5_2t7ly

2140148,0,t1_clbudcx,Solid points. I generally have the same feeling you have about Puget about other boutiques though at least the highend ones like OriginPC or Digitalstorm. Its certainly a product of marketing and the logic may well go that if they can afford to do the custom designs they do they can afford to support their customers but... the feeling is there POn your point about your brother Yes I would definitely trust your brother being watched over by you to assemble my PC but thats because I know you would stop him if he started putting the motherboard in without standoffs and know to test the build with integrated graphics if the dGPU wouldnt display an image and RMA the card if so and not to put the motherboard on the foilcoated bag and not to touch the CPU socket pins with anything and yadda yadda a thousand other things.Point is I think there are a lot of people for whom paying someone a small fee to get their word that the whole rig is in working condition rather than risk that what do I do my  worth of thingies is not showing me a Windows install screen and I have no clue why moment. I do want to encourage home building and asking the huge and awesome community for help but thats not the same as making it the only communitysupported option so Id love to have this be somewhat official as well.note this is putting an implicit amount of trust in your abilities as a PC builder that might not be quite as strong in real life since I havent met you but its close enough for arguments sake PWanna know a secret?

2390087,0,t3_2ms9cn,Thats a difficult budget to achieve what you want in canadian dollars thats probably why the prebuilt seemed out of budget.Honestly you dont need water cooling if you arent going to overclock and for  in canadian you are going to end up getting lower end processor just for the sake of overclocking it and if you arent going to get an overclockable processor to get a better value then you will not need the liquid cooler at all. Add on wanting to play newest CoD games on high... Thats when it gets rough.If you want it to be quiet youll want the Define R case with its silencing moduvents but a liquid cooler usually costs more and has the potential to make more noise in many situations when compared to large fan air cooling options large PWM fans can run very very quiet and get similar results on performance.,buildmeapc,cm74ebw,1,t5_2t7ly

4130370,0,t3_37z564,Something like this should meet your needs and requirements however it is  over budget but thats not much. You get a great p IPS monitor that matches the case colour. A cheap Z mobo it offers a better upgrade path and you wont save much money by getting a H. TB and GB SSD like you asked for. A fantastic  from MSI. The cheapest  is  less than this if you wanted you could get that and get a better keyboard entirely down to you. Windows . and an optical drive like you asked for. The wifi adapter also has great reviews.The case itself has good cable management considering its price and you wont have to remove any drive cages to fit the GPU even though its a mid tower. The front IO has two USB ports one of them being . and the standard headphone and microphone jacks. The keyboard is very simple and not fancy but at the same time is very cheap you can amend this build to get something better if you wish.As always I recommend trying to get some different opinions as I could have overlooked something or they could simply create a better build.PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchantType|Item|Price||CPU | Intel Core i .GHz QuadCore Processor | .

5821423,0,t1_cx6432x,Alright the questions are in!   The first question is standard if I had a bigger budget what would I change? After a few hours more reading I understand the components a lot better but I still have to start from the ground up to compare one part to its competition. For example I read some people saying that they bought the MSI H and wished they had spent the little extra money on a Z. I looked it up and found that it was not much more expensive but really couldnt tell what superiority it might have.   Following up on the previous comments why wouldnt we overclock on this build? Even without it Im still definitely considering liquid cooling if only as a personal interest. It sounds like a cool project with a fortunate side effect of futureproofing but if the internet votes to leave it for my next build well Im the newbie here.   For the case so far as I can tell the most important factors are size and cooling. Size seems to be based on motherboard size e.g. ATX in the current build so will anything sized for ATX with adequate cooling do? If I do run with liquid cooling do I need anything in particular for that? Finally how did you know you can add fans to the case? The next most common factor I see are drive trays which are just for holding extra storage as far as I can tell Anything else to keep in mind here?   Graphics cards are something I know I need to know more about if Im going to be a PC gamer. Id love any quick tips on how to compare the couple recommendations here against one another. But more foundationally can anyone offer advice on how to check compatibility? For example I see the chipset of the H is Intel while the chipset of the Radeon R  is AMD I imagine this isnt a problem since these parts were picked out but I dont know how to tell what is and what isnt relevant to compatibility.   I havent seen anything that divisive about hard drives. I found the gb  evo series for not too much more and everything Ive read says the speed a SSD will make a huge difference so I think thats something Ill spring for.   The last thing Ill poke at for now at least is RAM. If Lonxu or any other helpful redditers out there knows a good guide for comparing RAM Id love a link. Im aware DDR is the only type I should be looking at and I need to make sure it has the same pins as my motherboard. Any other compatibility notes or other issues? Once again  thanks for the help internet!,buildmeapc,cxipp5v,1,t5_2t7ly

6110385,0,t1_cyk08e1,Thats just a bot hes silly.Ive made some alternate suggestions and Ill explain themAn important component in water cooling is the surface area of your radiator. An Hs rad has no more surface area than your average air cooler so it only moves heat to the radiator faster but doesnt actually dissipate that heat out of the system any more effectively than air cooling. Small rad water coolers are more for small form factor systems you want a large rad water cooler. Hi is a great pick.Sabertooth is arbitrarily overpriced EVGA FTW gives that premium look and build quality for  less. All that big plate around the PCIE ports does is get in the way it doesnt do anything meaningful for cooling or protection. EVO and Constellation are just odd picks theyre no longer in production and are not as good as more modern counterparts.  EVO and WD Blue are the ways to go for this tier of desktop storage.Supernova NEX is not a very good PSU series Supernova G is a lot better as it has better quality capacitors and more built in protections. Its worth it to spend a little extra for cleaner overclocking and better overunder voltage safety.And lastly suggested a case that is more suited to installing a mm rad. CSAZ is set up for air cooling it has a mm top fan slot and a mm fan preinstalled. D comes with dual front mm and a rear mm preinstalled and a mm slot in the top open for an Hi. Its ideal for this setup.PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchantType|Item|Price||CPU | Intel Core iK .GHz QuadCore Processor | .  Newegg CPU Cooler | Corsair Hi GTX .

Micro ATX boards only come with two DIM slots Where the RAM is inserted so if you wanted to upgrade to  gigs from the  gigs you would have to buy a new set of two  gig sticks. If you wanted to just add two more sticks of  gigs to make  gigs in total with all  sticks you could go for an ATX sized motherboard. But then you would have to change the case to one that would fit an ATX board the one I have listed just fits a micro ATX board. If you would rather do that I can make some adjustments.

6963522,0,t3_4b33sr,Your budget is pretty loose theres actually quite a few different ways you could go with this. This is set up for a nice high quality build. Beefy case premium board premium storage overclockable CPU and RAM good power supply with AMD or Nvidia multi GPU capability. R  is a really good p card right now but its cheap enough to not be too worried about when you decide to move up to p with the late  or early  GPUs. With the new power draw curve AMD is showing with their nm GPUs an W is going to be plenty for multi GPU with even their high end cards and Nvidia will likely match them. As far as optionsIf you think youll always single GPU you could save  and go with a GQ instead of the GQ.Also i k fits your current budget but is a bit overpriced in Canada right now k is much better cost efficiency. Either of those different parts options would drop in fine with no other changes. PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchantType|Item|Price||CPU | Intel Core iK .GHz QuadCore Processor | .

It is matte black and green with green LEDs and other things.As far as the  over  that is fine that will give some more wiggle room and what not when it comes to your budget. Also as far as the wifi card and the optical drive... Both of those arent really necessary for a PC anymore.

If you can find something with a decent GPU in it or something without one thats priced well and has a decent PSU then youre set. Just from a  minute browse this looks all right if it stays close to start bid and youre in Auckland. At that price you can go grab a new monitor but to keep things cheap Im sure there are decent ones on TradeMe. A fair few systems I clicked on had monitors included too.

Probably not since the thermal paste was still fresh and if you had a good amount of it.gtThe screw was the wrong size and I didnt force it too much before I came to my senses. I had read the instructions and I remember noting that I needed to check the screw type this mistake was just me being dumb.Well I do that almost every time.gtthe motherboard in the case and making any connections there. The result was that connecting the rear fan to the motherboard header at the top left of the motherboard was VERY difficult and the CPU power header right next to it was nearly impossible. I had some success using chopsticks in the end. Other builders might consider changing the order from the video cpugtRAMgtheat sink back plategtmobo into casegtfan headergtCPU power headergtheat sink.Yeah if the heat sink is a big one this would be the correct order otherwise even with small hands putting in those cables could be impossible. I guess I could try to look for a different video or make a remark for this. gtThe other challenge is that the Zotac GeForce GTX  GB AMP! Edition Video Card is a monster and the power cables connected to it are pressing fairly hard against the glass of the case so that the side is bulging a bit. Not sure what to do about this one. Maybe new builders should shop around for another case??I actually noticed this myself with a GTX  classified which is also like ultrawide GPU I think. I could help it a bit by trying to manage the GPU power cables but its still pushing a bit against the window not really bulging though. Solution could be to change the recommended GPU to not be as wide or changing the case of course.Lastly you should check your BIOS settings for RAM settings. So you can enable the XMP profile. By default your RAM is running at Mhz I believe if you enable XMP it would then run at the intended Mhz or Mhz.You can monitor CPU clock speeds and core speeds with like And you can benchmark your system with  or ,buildmeapc,d943svt,5,t5_2t7ly

Yes its better than the other two options people posted.You could save money by getting a cheaper case but the Corsair case I listed is very good and large enough for any GPU you might want to upgrade to in the future. You have to be careful with cases because some arent large enough for certain parts or GPUs. You could also save money by getting rid of the SSD and adding one later when you save more money but youre better off starting with an SSD just big enough to install Windows on everything else would have to be on the WD Blue  TB HDD I listed.I didnt list Windows because you can get it really cheap from various websites.

Itll reduce loading times render times and other similar stuff. For gaming there is practically no difference to an ik. The ik is overclockable as its an unlocked CPU You can see from the k ending.CPU Cooler  For highend computers like this one Id get an highend air cooler over an AiO cooler any day because they perform similarly but are quieter and cheaper. The thing with an AiO cooler is that they still carry the risk of leakage however small that risk may be. And their performance wears down over time. If you care a lot about aesthetics though you might want to get an AiO cooler. They simply look better not going to argue with that.MOBO  The MOBO does not affect performance and the quality of a  and a  MOBO is basically the same. The only difference between MOBOs are the features. Thats why you should always get the cheapest MOBO with all the features you needwant. Else youre just paying for features youll never use. Since I do not know what features you want I went with the ASRock X Taichi as a placeholder MOBO. If you can tell me what features you exactly need I can recommend you a different one or you could stick with this one if this meets all your requirements.RAM  I did not know how much RAM you need but would GB be enough? The MHz will help for your work and also for gaming. You could probably get even higher frequency RAM but this one has great value at a very low price.SSD   The Samsung  Evo is a NVMe SSD meaning its one of the fastest SSDs you can get right now. The Samsung  Evo is a NVMe SSD. I recommend you use this SSD for all the content youre currently working on and then transfer them over to the HDD once youre done to free up space. Do not store games on here they do not benefit as much from it as large files do. See this video.SSD   The SK hynix SL has great value. Its very close in performance to the Samsung  but a lot cheaper. This SSD would be for all your other programs and also most played games.HDD  For mass storage. The Toshiba CA has one of the lowest failure rates to date. Store things like photos videos documents on here. And stuff you do not access often.GPU  The GTX is the best GPU you can get right now Lets disregard the Titan X Pascal that one is very overpriced for the little performance gain it brings over a GTX. A GTX should be enough for p Hz gaming.Case  Very good case. Easily accessible you can easily open the side window for cleaning. Has great cable management and airflow as well. Of course this is just a recommendation the case comes down to preference after all.PSU  High quality PSU. The EVGA G is an upgrade over the EVGA G which has made quite a name for itself. I know W is overkill right now but it leaves a lot of room for upgrades in the future if you need them e.g. SLI. Besides you ideally want your PSU under  load which W does. And higher wattage means the PSU is under less load and the PSU will last longer.Monitor   The Dell SDG is a high quality p Hz GSync monitor. Its a TN monitor and will be your gaming monitor. TN means youll have slightly worse color accuracy but a low response time of ms. BUT the Dell SDG has really great color accuracy for a TN panel it almost matches that of an IPS panel with the right calibration just google the settings its all over the internet.Monitor   The Dell UD will be your workmultimedia monitor. The IPS will mean it has great color accuracy. Dell is one of the few companies that produce Ultrasharp monitors meant for Professional Image Editors. Ultrasharp means even greater color accuracy and great image quality.Keyboard  Didnt include one because these mostly come down to preference. Id suggest taking a look over at rMechanicalKeyboards and asking there what theyd recommend. Ducky KUL Leopold Varmilo HHKB are some very popular brands there. I highly recommend testing out switches yourself before you purchase because everyone has his own preferences.,buildmeapc,ddct77r,6,t5_2t7ly
