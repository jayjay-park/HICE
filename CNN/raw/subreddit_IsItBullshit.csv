It has however evolved from its origins in Vitalism which is undoubtedly not proven and to be honest hilariously implausible to focussing on treating lower back pain which is the one thing all the messing around with joints is proven to have any effect on.In most of the world its not a contentious subject because there arent that many about and people rarely have a vested interest like friends relatives who swear by them or make their living as one. This is not the case in the US and Australia where theyre all over the place. When people from these lands get involved in the debate passion and anecdotal evidence pours forth and people get heated. This is especially true if like most they have no idea what it actually isbased on and are hearing for the first time that its well bullshit.So even though the whole thing is unproven except for back pain its as effective as physiotherapy a proven practice because thats basically all it is when it works people believe in it because its part of the furniture.

Its a good way to relax in the same way that meditation or excercise are but dependence on something so fragile is risky.

The nature of your experience is not entirely amenable to empirical observation and measurement.ASMR is not bullshit some of the stuff on YouTube since it became trendy is however.  To me anybody that didnt come by that acronym through researching a phenomenon that has been happening to them all their lives does not really have ASMR.  Or if not through research than through an immediate recognition of a term that describes something that has been happening to them all their lives.  Anybody who just stumbles upon it and leaves comments on videos like I think I got tingles from this video or even those are just relaxed by the videos dont have the response.  For a lot of producers on YouTube it is just an excuse to put their cleavage in the camera and talk seductively while tapping on something obviously having completely misunderstood this phenomena and just looking for attention  jumping on the band wagon so to speak.  The videos dont do it for me sometimes they do but not often.It is very real and palpable.  I dont know why I never researched it earlier in life Im  male but then again it only acquired a label in .  I dont know how much variation there is among people.  The triggers can definitely be different and perhaps the areas of the body that react but I dont know if anyone could say it is anything but extremely pleasant and relaxing when in full gear.  It does make listening to people especially if your trigger is their voice lol and focusing on anything other than the trigger difficult.  For example I met with my financial advisor.  I tried to listen to what he was telling me about how my mutual funds were doing where I should move my money etc etc but the whole time he is very carefully and meticulously licking his finger and flipping through pages running his finger across the page to point things out speaking in a low calm voice.  Nope.  Cant do it.  Just gonna have to trust him.  Cant follow what hes saying.  Scalp is going mad with tingles that roll down my shoulders.  Every time I move esp rolling shoulders it accentuates them and they flow down my back.  For me Id say its comparable to a scalp massage.Same thing has happened all my life in response to keyboard typing page flipping esp newspapers rummaging th grade kid drawing beside me in class taking his time very careful slowly reaching into pencil case knocking them around lifting one out sound of pencil on paper certain accents coupled with tone of voice.It is not the same as Frisson. ,IsItBullshit,cquu6xz,1,t5_2yhlm

4973271,0,t1_culdnam,Water dowsing actually works using the ideomotor effect meaning that the person doing it is totally in control of where the wand leads them.  I think that the real reason they are considered so good at finding water is three fold They have become very good at knowing where a well would be.  I dont know what sort of skills are involved there but if an experienced dowser can identify a potential well using their normal senses and some geographical knowledge then the dowsing rod only serves as a confirmation of what they already believe when it identifies a water source. If you drill anywhere in the area of an large underground water table you will find water.  The dowser doesnt even need any skill because randomly pointing to a spot in the area will have the exact same hit rate.  In this case the decision of where to drill is more based on what the dowser thinks the farmer wants and they just serve to confirm the opinion of the farmer. The farmers only remember the times that the dowser got it correct creating a confirmation bias.  Any dowser that gets it wrong might be dismissed as a bad dowser even though the good dowser just got lucky.All of these possibilities could easily create a scenario where dowsing is totally useless but appears to work very well.  Remember that just because a dowser got things right a few times does not confirm dowsing.  You need to compare dowsing to finding a well through random chance or just professional geological knowledge before saying that.,IsItBullshit,culf1w1,13,t5_2yhlm

5496931,0,t3_3qaai0,Assuming this is the link of the article youre referring to There are a few problems here.gt The finding  reached by a group of  international scientists who scrutinized existing research in more than  studies  concluded there is enough evidence to say that processed meats such as hot dogs and ham cause colorectal cancer. And they found eating as little as  grams of processed meat a day drives up that risk by  per cent.When someone uses already existing studies to evaluate a hypothesis its called doing a metastudy. A metastudy can never reveal causation  only correlation. That means its impossible to say what causes what in the causal chain. All it can claim is that processed meats and cancer occur at the same time  not which comes first or if there is even a relationship between the two.Also wording it as ... drives up that risk by  is meaningless without context. What is the risk factor in the first place? .? Adding  of . isnt very much. And does the risk factor increase by  each day that you consume processed meats or is it the total result from eating processed meats every day for a period of time?Also is it the processing of the meat that is the problem or is it how the meat is treated when its still inside the living animal? It says nothing about the antibiotics other medications stimulants and steroids unnatural food and unnatural living conditions that the living meat has to endure before it goes into processing. Does this affect the result at all? Or is it the adding andor subtracting mechanically chemically or otherwise of the meat that is the real issue? I mean its talking about processed meats so Ill assume the latter but more clarification is needed. The article DOES have a guy say something about it not being a causal relationship but the writer of the article still chooses words like cause cancer.Its very typical for articles to be condensations and simplifications of science in order to attract the attention of more readers. And science is already hard to understand not really when you have no understanding of scientific method language or mentality. One thing seems to be certain  if you word yourself in bombastic ways and use scary words such as asbestos risk of cancer tobacco and carcinogenic you achieve a stronger impact because of fear.Conclusion Red meatprocessed meat MAY cause cancer or it may not. The article definitely doesnt know and the science doesnt know yet. There are indications of a relationship through correlation but direct experimentation need to be performed in order to evaluate the real link between the two variables.,IsItBullshit,cwea9up,2,t5_2yhlm

5856484,0,t1_cxn6ypi,gtGang related mass violence doesnt happen in other countries with tighter gun control laws. This falsely attributes lower gun crime to gun regulation and not the actual presence of gangs in these countries. Norway has tighter gun regulation but also does not have the same gang presence as well do so of course its going to have a lower level of gangrelated mass violence but not by virtue of gun control. But even ignoring the problem with the logic it isnt true. Latin America has some of the tightest gun regulation and still has a high incidence of gun violence. I would wager that the vast majority of this crime is cartel violence with burgeoning connections to US gangsgtPeople are complaining that the statistic includes gang related mass shootings but tighter gun control will also reduce the number of gang related mass shootings.It will not. Criminals in general avoid legal avenues to purchase guns and as the article states Gangs in particular have actually been found to suppress the gun trade in their neighborhood to preserve their monopoly on violence and to avoid the police attention that comes from gun use They are well seasoned in circumventing gun regulation and are motivated to do what they can to maintain their trafficking business.,IsItBullshit,cxnbaji,1,t5_2yhlm

Id personally bet that a large portion of USsourced arms in cartel arsenals are there by way of other Latin American countries where they were shipped CIA and Department of Defense during any number of different wars that the US poked its nose into or via corrupt employees of Mexican army or police units who are also recipients of weaponry from the US government.  Cartels especially Los Zetas have been using more and more militarygrade weaponry such as RPGs or fully automatic weapons like the M which are not commercially available in the US without a lot of red  tape and tens of thousands of dollars  Furthermore the traces that have been done on guns recovered in Mexico were incomplete and the ATF admitted they only focused on guns likely to be of US origin so results from them are a measure of how good the Mexican authorities are at guessing a guns source than a measure of what percentage of cartel weapons were commercially purchased in the US.,IsItBullshit,cxnhmip,1,t5_2yhlm

7736422,0,t3_4l8dp6,Carnism and veganism are both bullshit not as practices people can obviously be practicing vegans or carnists but as ideologies about what is normal natural or right. It is neither morally right nor morally wrong to consume meat and any argument otherwise is an exercise in elaborate bullshit. Placing a moral argument on a subsistence strategy is to use your words an appeal to emotion. The only real objective truth regarding food is that all living species must consume other living species to survive themselves. Whether you have to kill a faceless green creature or one with two eyes and four legs you are consuming a living being.The distinction between flora and fauna is speciesism which is why I find it so ironic when vegans use the very same concept to advocate that animals have value and should not be harmed because they have apparent consciousness. But this is an emotional assumption based on how it makes us feel to see a being with a similar recognizable structure like other creatures with faces and eyes that can look sad or with voices that can cry out when experiencing obvious pain or stress. This affects us emotionally because we can identify with it. But we have scientifically no way of entering the consciousness of any other species so we have no idea if plants and other animals actually do think and feel like we do. It is entirely possible that plants are highly sensitive and experience sensations and pain just like us but dont have faces to show it. Life is diverse and takes many forms but humans seem to have a bias towards the species closest to us on the evolutionary tree. We typically have no love or sentimentality for spiders or tardigrades or fungi or plants. If it is not within earshot of us on the evolutionary tree we dont really give a crap about its agency or rights. So with some critical thinking and a bit of anthropological perspective we can see that moral arguments about food stem from our own subconscious biases.  Hence turning this into a moral argument whether for or against meat becomes an exercise in emotional reasoning not logic.  Our ideas about what is acceptable right or normal are societally constructed. The same way we consciously place values on life and subscribe to cultural norms or taboos on the consumption of certain animals like society saying that it is okay to eat a cow but not a dog we subconsciously do the same thing about a wealth of things we take for granted and are entirely unaware of. Plants dont have faces that give us the feels when we kill and consume them so we assume it is a more compassionate responsible practice. Plants and animals are living beings that we have to kill to survive. We can try to find ways that are more emotionally appealing by causing the least amount of observable suffering we call this being humane and that is a noble endeavor surely. But I think we should refrain from elevating our biases into objective moral arguments or assuming that we understand the truth about life through our extremely limited view of the universe. We are  of approximately  species on the planet.,IsItBullshit,d3lkq3y,5,t5_2yhlm

Too many of these and they start to disrupt the normal function of your cell. Antioxidants are molecules that can bind to these positively charged oxygen atoms in place of more important molecules. Note that too many antioxidants can essentially get in the way of the other molecules in your cells  you need antioxidants but dont go overboard. Electrons are not antioxidants. Mixing free radicals and Electrons will produce stable oxygen but this is not how cells work. You cant just send in single Electrons and trust that theyll find their way to the free radicals. There are a lot of things in the way cell membranes are notoriously hard to cross and the electrons certainly wont make it from the ground. Finally recall the concept of grounding from physics. This is where you connect something to the ground to reduce the number of electrons. This works because the earth will take as many electrons as you can give it. It doesnt usually give them back without a fight. Oh one more thing  you know when you rub a balloon against your hair and it stands up? Thats because you have extra electrons! There are definitely not fighting free radicals for you. This idea is almost diametrically opposed to everything we know about the biological function of electrons.,IsItBullshit,d55r0np,4,t5_2yhlm

Race riots alone tore black people away from land they bought tended and used to make money. Race riots destroyed numerous prosperous cities were the residents created everything they had. The most famous example being Tulsa in . They were good at something. They had brains. They were millionaires who took their little abode in the city and owned everything and made bank.And THIS is what happened to that little city. Their descendants the surviviors the sons and daughters who lived had to restart with nothing.And then you had on top of all that all the laws created specifically to prevent black people from passing on wealth.This has nothing to do with having brains and being good at something. Because of skin color some people couldnt see the fruit of their labors. These reasons are to this day why a lot of black people speficailly dont own land anymore despite a good portion of them having had it in the pass. It couldnt be passed down to them.
