Lets you make notes look up definitions mark pages etc.Torrents for scanned PDFs are fine but textbooks that have been optimised for Kindle or iBooks are fantastic. Not every book is available though. There are many other apps though that let you do incredible things with PDF files therefore if you really want to make notes and scribble over a textbook then find a PDF and open it in an app like this. ,ipad,ceoj9qw,6,t5_2rgny
92916,0,t3_1v5tkw,I got an Air this year mostly for school amp textbooks.  I like it a lot as its lighter than my laptop but lets me do almost everything I need to typing long passages is hard without a keyboard.  Its absolutely great for textbooks providing you get a good app I use GoodReader but maybe wait until they do the iOS update....  I cant say I like it for note taking though... even with Notability and a stylus I found it far too uncomfortable and slow compared to a pencil and paper.  Which sucks because Id like to be able to digitize everything.  I write very fast and messily though so if youre more methodical notetaking may work better.  As I understand it the iPads touch interface just isnt highfidelity enough to provide truly realistic handwriting experience.As far as Mini vs. Air goes if youre going to be using textbooks a lot Id recommend the Air just for screen realestate.  The battery has been excellent as well.  For intermittent use I can get a few days out of it.  For heavy use around  hours.,ipad,cep0b1d,5,t5_2rgny

308139,0,t3_1xm8nx,Im guessing this mail account is using an active sync Exchange connection. Either to gmail outlook.com or a company provided mail system.   Simply put your iPad is failing to authenticate to the mail server but it has a record of existing mail messages. As it cannot authenticate it cannot verify the messages exist and that you should be able to view them so it shows this.   Go into Settings gt Mail Contacts Calendars and choose the problematic account then click on the email address at the next screen. You should now see the connection details for the account.  Edit any of the fields but make sure you put it back exactly as it was  maybe take a letter off the end of the server address then put it back.  Click Done.  The result you get here will determine your next steps. If the authentication fails verify with your mail provider that the settings you have are correct and put them in.  If the authentication is ok but the message issue continues your mail admin has some work to do as their system has an Active Sync Autodiscover issue.

The magnets are strong enough for both of them to attach.Its not scratching the glass what its screwing up is the oleophobic coating.

930702,0,t1_cha1hqr,I tried Evernote but never liked it. Notability is one of the big ones for note taking but there are others that do the same as Notability. The only reason why I use Notability was because I saw other grad students in my program using Notability so if I ever have a problem I know I can ask around and see if they face the same issue. The reasons for me loving Notability are becausenote will mean documents pdfs notes writtentypedaudio created in app. As I said earlier if I run across an issue or wonder if I can do something in Notability I can always ask someone in my program.. Backup your notes to Dropbox Google Drive Box or WebDAV. You also get to choose the format that the notes are backed up as whether that be in the Notability format called Note or as a PDF and RTF also if you want to include any audio you recorded. . iCloud is used to only sync notes in Notability with any other device you use Notability on for me I write my notes on my iPad and if Im out and about and have some free time Ill open up Notability on my iPhone to study my notes if I dont have my iPad with me.. Customization Almost endless customizations of your notes from the thickness of a pencil or highlighter used to what colors you want to use for each. Also you can add sticky notes import or take photos web clips add in figures shapes essentially. . Importing notes you can import PDFs RTFs and Notability files but if you use Google Drive and I think any Cloud Storage that converts word documents you can also import Microsoft Office files .doc.ppt.xls.. If I want to share my notes with a classmate I can share them via email Noatability format PDF or RTF with or without audio By Dropbox Google Drive AirDrop Box sending them to iTunes Print and more if you open the notes in another app exporting to say Amazon Kindle or Microsofts OneDrive.. Recently Audio is linked to your typing and your writing so think Lightscribe pen but without needing to buy a Lightscribe pen and paper. . I can find my Textbooks legality is questionable online in PDF format and save them or import them in Notability and take notes in the Textbooks along with bookmarking multiple pages that I may want to come back to. Now of course other note taking apps will have everything I listed but since I dont hear about people using them Ive tried only two others and they werent what I was looking for I can probably assume that the other apps if I run into an issue I will have to rely on forums and emailing the developer to find a solution whereas with Notability I can email the developer they responded to my email in about  hours I can go to forums but I can also ask the people in my program that I see almost everyday which is a huge benefit to me. I doubt Ive sold you on Notability but why not go to iTunes and download Notability for free while it still is and if you get an iPad download other note taking apps and see which one you like. Notability is a Universial app and you can use it on any iOS device.,ipad,cha2pyl,3,t5_2rgny

967306,0,t3_256acn,Realistically there is no best iPad.  The two best options available currently are as mentioned the latest iterations of both the full sized iPad the iPad Air and the iPad Mini the newest version with the retina display.  Personally I feel the iPad Mini Retina is the best allaround tablet for reasons including portability overall size as to what I feel a tablet should be and the fact that I use it as a supplementary device. However this all changes if youre going to be using the iPad as your primary computing device.  If your wife plans on using it to create edit and share documents and other files as well as for taking notes in classes etc. she may want to consider investing in the full sized iPad Air for the additional screen real estate.  Its almost essential for doing any real work with one.  Plus with the fullsized Air you generally have better accessory support such as folio cases with built in bluetooth keyboards based on the fact that the keyboard is closer to a full sized keyboard which is more comfortable and something shed be use to instead of a much more cramped tinier keyboard shell generally get with an iPad Mini.  So again theres a few things to consider here mainly what her primary purposeuse of the device will be.  Either route she or you decide to go with your purchase Id say its almost out of the question to consider anything aside from the latest generation of either iPad.  Good luck with your purchase.,ipad,che8qkn,3,t5_2rgny

Blizzard is not a moneygrabber company by any stretch of imagination. You can get all cards by simply playing the game. There are two main gameplay modes ranked and arena. In ranked you need to have a decent amount of good cards to climb though there competitive decks that can be built quickly but in arena you are using random cards that you choose beforehand so you can play on the same level as everyone else. Arena awards cards so you can play arena to get cards to play ranked. Its more involved than that of course but its fun and thats what matters eh?,ipad,ciinnek,2,t5_2rgny

2676490,0,t1_cn7qm65,I dont use this app for anything since it hasnt been released yet and I dont have the old version. However I do use it in Windows and OSX as the goto application whenever something wont play.  What I like about VLC is the large number of settings and tweaks although it works fine out of the box and that it is also a versatile audio player. Looking at VLC Streamer I see that it costs a couple bucks with a free version adsupported which some dont care for and needs a helper app installed on ones computer.  If I find apps to be redundant I get rid of the one that does less or works worse.  Im hoping the upcoming VLC is a good app...,ipad,cn7xsy7,1,t5_2rgny

The tech people hired are swamped with people having problems every day and there are plenty of capable IT people there.

3457086,0,t1_cpmbl3b,Id at least try the back first. Its less risky. Personally Id slap drop then maybe MAYBE drop edge in that order. My problem with your approach is that the glass is way more susceptible to breakage that way. Also if you miss even a little and drop on a corner its hugely more susceptible. And dropping on a protruding switch has a pretty good chance of screwing up the switch or board its mounted to by punching it inwards. Finally hands around it notwithstanding if you drop on an edge you might not catch it right especially if youre not  perpendicular. Next stop might be on the glass on the floor. Frankly Id take to the store before risking dropping it on an edge. To OP I hate to say because Im certain parent poster means well but I wouldnt do this. But I think the other person was bangon. Dropping it on its back on a towel is pretty safe. ,ipad,cpmc0oc,2,t5_2rgny

5030838,0,t3_3ju5fz,Hi Im a completely paperless college senior. I have been since Sophomore year. I bring my iPad a stylus and a calculator to class and thats all. My must have apps are  Notability  i use this the most. There is so many things that make this the best note taking app out there. Its handwriting quality is the best out there. I dont know what is technically going on but when i draw a line and then zoom all the way in the line is still crisp no pixeling on the edges. Its like Its a vector stroke but Im sure its not. Its voice recording is fantastic. It matches the audio to what you are writing so that when you go back to review the notes your handwriting appears as you wrote it in real time. This is useful for finding the portion of the lecture that you want to hear again. You can also mix the audio within the app to make it sound the best. It has settings for whether the speaker was far away or close to you etc and it sounds much better. Its Mac app is great too. Has all the same features. Additionally it has an open in Notability function so that if you open a PDF PPT EXCEL DOC whatever from the web or email you can open it in notability and its downloaded offline for you to annotate. Plus it has backups to Dropbox Box Google Docs whatever you want. Scanner Pro All paper documents that I get are scanned directly into my iPad with this. This is my favorite scanner app because of how it handles finding the edge of documents. It doesnt have OCR but I have not seen an iOS scanner app that is worth a damn when it comes to OCR anyway. Dropbox obviously Not an app but I take all my notes by hand and I use the Adonit Jot Pro. Its the best stylus I have used. Precise and well made. Just use a screen protector tech armor HD. You literally cant tell these are there.  and bring a cloth to clean the screen before class and you will be golden. I have pages but I do extended writing on my computer so the pages app doesnt get used very often. Textbook apps are a must. Just get it wherever you can find it for cheapest. Kindle nook etc. I actually end up renting the physical copy of books and leave them at home unless the professor says we need to have it in class every day. Quizlet this is sort of a bonus best flashcards service out there. Easy to use and works well with a Bluetooth keyboard because you can just keep tabbing through the input boxes. No need to tap next. Let me know if you have any other questions. Id be happy to offer other recommendations or alternatives to the above. ,ipad,cuseolp,5,t5_2rgny

5347716,0,t3_3o9lzq,Im a big fan of Notability and use it exclusively for taking notes during meetings and managing daily todo lists. It has an elegant and easy to organize interface and syncs reliably across devices. The builtin audio recorder is great as it lets you review something you might have missed but check your state laws about the legality of recording conversations without each partys consent.Unlike every other notetaking solution Ive tried over the years Ive stuck with this one for two years. My typing is far quicker and more legible than my handwriting plus typed input allows me to edit reformat and search within my notes afterwards so I never use handwritten notes. They now have a Mac app as well though its interface and functionality are pretty bare bones compared to the iOS app. I gifted this app to a friend in college and he now happily uses it for note taking in all his classes.I tried OneNote many years ago and didnt like it. Its changed dramatically since then so I cant honestly offer an opinion on it other than to echo your reluctance to depend on Microsofts ecosystem.,ipad,cvv8by5,6,t5_2rgny

Why wouldnt I want to TRY and use my iPad as a camera? Its got an AMAZING viewfinder and this shoot from  used the Gs camera iphone fashion shoot . Photography is all about the light and if you had amazing light why not use the iPad. Its a tool in the end. It may not be the right tool but let people try. I think its strange that sometimes people critique Steve Jobs for saying people shouldnt hold their iPhone  a certain way atennagate but then turn around and say you shouldnt use your iPad as a camera. We can and should do whatever we want with the tools we have. ,ipad,cyf1cj2,1,t5_2rgny

The first is that its very uncomfortable to write at the bottom of the screen. With infinite vertical scrolling you can just scroll down a bit and continue writing in the middle of the screen. The second is that its just disruptive to have to break off your work and continue on another page. If Im in the middle of making a diagram or something I either have to remove it from the first page and recreate it on the second page or split it in two both of which are irritating. It also tends to disrupt your thought process and make you lose your place if youre solving a complicated math problem.

Having an iPad replaces the paper Id need to carry around if I wanted full portability or lugging a fullon laptop everywhere. I have used and worked with other styluses in the past addonit  Pencil back when I had an iPad Air .  Theyre... okay.  lacking any other alternatives they would be fine.  But having used an Apple Pencil I would hate to go back.As for other stuff Were a SharepointOffice  outfit so I use Ms Office on the iPad frequently.   Ive also found that with Prompt  I can do quite a bit of remote administration of the servers Im responsible for too.  Having a cellular data connection is a very big plus.As an aside Ive been having to deal with a lot of legal documents contracts and such recently and DocuSign has been really excellent for this.  I can review and turn over documents very quickly were not dealing with tons of annoying paper everything gets archived electronically and I can review it quickly later and signing with and Apple Pencil makes it my signature not some fauxcursive that can be questioned later.Return on investment really depends on how much use youre going to get out of it.  Frankly the iPad Pro has more options.  I am also willing to bet the . Pro will have a bit longer support cycle than an iPad Air  bought today.I would suggest finding an Apple store or a place that sells iPads and has them on display and trying out the Apple Pencil for yourself.,ipad,d675con,1,t5_2rgny

You select the area get the context menu select Take Screenshot and you can paste it either onto another page or import that snippet as its own page. You can also remove and reorder pages within documents and notebooks arbitrarily which I often do to annotate certain PDFs.Its a decent enough workflow now that GoodNotes has a tabbed document interface meaning you can jump between documents quickly. As an alternative you could also import your PDFs into GoodNotes for screenshotting and dualscreen another app to paste the copied images into since GoodNotes places the captured region onto the system clipboard.,ipad,d6lfgjx,1,t5_2rgny

8675509,0,t3_4yjyqn,Cellular option depends on your usage or really where you will be using it. If youll be using it mostly in wifi spots your place Starbucks college then cellular would be mostly underused and thus not really worth it. But if you see yourself using it often outside of wifi then cellular would likely be worth it. Im mostly in wifi and when not I just tether from my iPhone. To me at this time cellular wouldnt be worth it. Space is also subjective. Im on my third iPad each purchase was mostly due to needing more space. Why do I need space? Mostly games I have a few individual games over GB each and about a dozen over GB. Second video media. I buy season passes of my favorite TV shows and I like to keep the latest several episodes on my iPad. Each episode is around MB. I also like keeping a few movies on it each movie is easily .GB. So  episodes and ten movies can eat GB. And that doesnt include any music or podcasts or photos. I currently have about GB used on my GB iPad. For me thats a comfy spot. My first GB iPad was nearly full after a month. My second GB iPad was nearly full after a week. Ive had this GB iPad for about half a year and Ive never had it nearly full. I could if I wanted I have a TB media collection  but I dont need all of it on my iPad at same time. If you mainly stream media and dont horde games you wont shouldnt need a ton of space. Documents dont have take up much room and a lot of those are just as easy to keep in a cloud than the device. But if I were thinking about a . iPad I would seriously consider maxing it out. I wont need cellular but it would make the iPad more viable for longer and increase resell value. While Ive shown myself that I can comfortably live within GB I do have a huge media library so I could not have too much space. And with GB it would be more viable for longer and increase resell value. In the end I would likely get GB wifi model because I lack cash for options I wouldnt need  but I would seriously consider those options. And if I saw a deal with those options I would bite. ,ipad,d6q285t,2,t5_2rgny

I bought it because at the time I didnt have an iPad pro.I now have an iPad pro and will soon be getting an Apple Pencil. I really want to use an app with handwriting recognition and the only one that is even close to being acceptable is Notes Plus. Ive tried Inflow Notes HD Goodnotes and some others and am really not impressed. My Newton was better than that. As it is NotesPlus is not ready for me to use full time with the Pixel  it misses too much of what I try to write although the HW recognition is good. Im hoping that the results with the Pencil will be better.,ipad,d9qvp4m,2,t5_2rgny

Just give it another week or so and youll see another sale. Probably because the new ipads are supposed to come out in March. As far as getting a mini or air it depends on the use. The mini is more manageable to read at night or have on a nightstand. Also a lot of women just toss it in their purse to take it everywhere. Well my mom does it so I assume its pretty common.  The air is good for watching videos and playing games. Also you can zoom further and still have quite a bit of text on the screen. Ultimately its a matter of personal preference.
