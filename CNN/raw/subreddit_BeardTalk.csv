800490,0,t1_cguzuw7,I considered this for a minute until I confirmed via tons of babykid photos that I have never had curly or wavy hair.  Ever.  The hair on my head is extraordinarily straight.  My leg hair is straight.  My chest hair has a bit of a curl to it but my beard is easily x as curly.  Im not a fan.  Its honestly making me consider a serious trim.,BeardTalk,cgv9ol3,2,t5_30qjy
1098621,0,t1_cht4r8r,I dont see a problem with it myself. Of course a woman who is too forward in her approach can be as offputting as a man who is tooforward. Either way people just need to stop beating around the bush and get to beating their bushes together.,BeardTalk,cht628y,8,t5_30qjy
1139854,0,t3_276e86,First of all its your looks bro! Just chill. If it makes you feel uncomfortable clean shave it asap. But if you want to grow it get used to people telling you to shave it and that you look bad with it. Dont. Let. It. Discourage. You. Its their opinion why should it be more important than your? Also start reading the guides from this subreddit for proper growing your beard. I guarantee to you that its worth reading it to make up your mind.Hope to see you again on this sub!,BeardTalk,chxueu1,4,t5_30qjy

2661325,0,t3_2qgaoh,You could use scissors or trimmer but at that length Id say a trimmer you save you time and keep things more even. The only problem with a trimmer is that it sharpens the hairs which can make it itchy. Using a brush can help with this as itll round off any barbs that form due to trimmer use but at that length a brush wont really be needed for styling. Youll want a beard oil to keep your skin and beard hydrated so you can avoid dry skin beardruff and itchiness. plus youll get a nice soft beard too. Feel free to check out the oils I make and sell at www.abeardshop.com. Good luck with your growing and share any questions or updates!  ,BeardTalk,cn5yo2i,1,t5_30qjy

3098679,0,t3_2vn52n,Thats a common dream theme normally with head hair or teeth though usually associated with growing oldfear of growing old. I wouldnt pay it too much mind. Have you been thinking about losing your hair or imagining what it would be like to just take the beard off?I had a dream the other day I was trimming a friends beard and messed up so I let him shave mine of as reparation.,BeardTalk,coj6dh6,2,t5_30qjy
3801764,0,t3_32l27f,Hey man just start carrying around an index card.  Everytime you catch yourself touching your facial hair put a check on the card.This will make you more aware.Soon you will start catching yourself BEFORE you do it. Put a star on the card when this happens and do some other small thing like stretch your hands or  deep breaths  something that gives you a little release of tension.Keep this up and pretty soon you will drive this habit into one of these new ones.This works for lots of stuff.,BeardTalk,cqpmqc0,1,t5_30qjy

4853561,0,t3_3glacn,I know that the train of thought is the brushing will help train the hair but I went three months brushing it a ton and finally it started to stay out of the way....drinking it would get in the way but only a simple swipe to put it back. However while I had no problem with my girlfriend after we broke there have been a couple that have struggled with it I think it was just the different kissing styles....but after two complained I started to trim the stash again....I know horrible....but it doesnt look bad and no more listening to complaints about my beard it is otherwise loved,BeardTalk,cu6bsvz,1,t5_30qjy

6353365,0,t3_42md5z,I shaved mine around the same time.  It was a gorgeous monther.  So much love care and affection had gone into it.  I betrayed it.  Who was I to think I could separate from the one thing that represents my entirety and reason for being?  I was so naive.  Its slowly coming around again weve been hanging out for almost a month now but things just arent the same between us.  Its going to be a long road back to trust.  ,BeardTalk,czbt2gr,3,t5_30qjy

8737964,0,t3_4zq5j1,I use grave before shave stuff myself. I tried a few different sents of theirs like them all. I had a problem with a dry beard and I found what I was using to wash it in the shower was more to blame then anything else. So I use grampas pine tar soap to wash. Those two and a good brush did wonders for mine.,BeardTalk,d6xw812,9,t5_30qjy
