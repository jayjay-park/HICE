The last one will let you play backed up ISOs but not always.How it works is someone finds a exploit in a game via a save file. He or she tells it to the community we need to buy set game and install it to the vita Sony pulls the game from the store exploit finder releases save file you install save file on your vita and load it.

Next when running emulators SNES would get me to a ROM screen after playing the intro just fine but it would not load a ROM properly and would freeze with a font error.

6972562,0,t3_4b3r04,I dont think the above method works.You can use the Mimana Iyar Chronicle exploit however. Download the ARK exploit save that Qwikrazor madeThen download this VHBLCopy the PBOOT.PBP from the VHBL archive and replace it with the PBOOT.PBP in Mimana Save folder. Also copy the VHBL folder into you save directory.You have two choices now if youre using the legit version of Mimana you can leave everything as is and your Minana bubble will turn into VHBL it will remove ARK if you had that before. You could also choose another game to write over. PSP demos work too like the Locoroco Demo in the PSN which you could copy over with a PS.If you want to write to another game open H.BIN with a hex editor and look for wherever it says msPSPGAMEXXXXXXXX should be the Mimana game code and change it to whatever gamecode you want to write over.If Mimana is already an ARK bubble you can still run the game in the Ark menu then just do what the instructions say. Remember youll have to copy the game you patch to and from QCMA.This worked for me last night but I didnt get a chance to test any homebrew. Ive heard that you shouldnt use games that were patched to run homebrew so maybe it wont work if you patch Minama and you might want to avoid patching games like Pool Hall Pro. I believe this should work regardless of how you obtain Minama... but then youll have to choose a legit game to write to. Youll lose that bubbleThese are games that have been patched It doesnt include a few of the exploit games from .. but you can find those using the HackInformer firmware guide.

The update downloads but it doesnt install and the yellow icon is still there.Im not sure what causes this but these steps have always resolved it for me. Im using VitaUpdateBlocker so this may or may not apply to you  restart VitaUpdateBlocker it sometimes hangs depending on how much traffic is sent turn off unit reboot into recovery mode hold down the power button for  seconds or so rebuild database this clears some caches as well as the obvious connect to internet make sure to configure the proxy with the IP running  VitaUpdateBlocker in network settings  open the store to force an update check you can close the store before you receive the update message verify the update check has occurred on VitaUpdateBlocker spoofed to version.. disable the proxy on your VitaPSTV do not use under network settings  open the livearea of your game. wait for the update icon to pop up click the update icon. wait for the update to download. when it does waiting to install.. go to network settings and uncheck connect to the internet open up network settings and reenter your proxy information open the live area and start the game normallyAt this point it always finds the update and installs for me. If youre manually blocking certain urls at the router level you may need to check to see if one of those is actually critical to the update process. it is safe to block the listsAnd always  backup a game BEFORE you attempt to update. You never know if the update will remove a feature in the game or possibly bump the firmware requirement. If it does at least you revert back to the last good version.,vitahacks,d6cc7hu,3,t5_2tkwr

Windows  did this and its probably great for touch users to have a larger place to thumb however this wasted space is inconvenient to desktop users.

11339546,0,t1_dfgk6yi,The account region alone isnt enough to determinante the needed language. E.g. one of the Tekken  PSP releases in europe features  different languages not sure how many other releases with different languages for europe alone exist. Not even the country would be enough e.g. the swiss has three offical languages and canada two french and english.Normaly the language is set by the PSP system language. Therefore I assume the language is choosen either acording to the Vita system language or acording to the language of the base game used for ARK. Maybe he just used a japanese game to install ARK.,vitahacks,dfhbg8r,1,t5_2tkwr
11340391,0,t3_61u4gp,i know this muchWhen you first turn on the system a trophy file is generated its attached to your PSID and CIDWhenever you load up the trophy app it checks your consoles CID and PSIDIf they match the ones on the trophy file then the app opensif they dont the system will automatically generate a new trophy file. also whenever a trophy is synced the tropby gets flagged as synced and it wont bother sending it to PSN again this is probably more to speed it up than anything elseoh and i know one other thingit doesnt acturay check if the PSID your system is set to ACTYRALLY matches the account your signed into,vitahacks,dfhewg0,2,t5_2tkwr

You have  idea how many  let alone gb cards they sold.  gb didnt even make it to the states if that is an indicator.You want to use normal SD cards not only to show some good will but also people in this day and age really shouldnt be hesitant to buy in your online store which doesnt have any extra cuts unlike retail because they think about running out of space.And that is exactly what happened.
