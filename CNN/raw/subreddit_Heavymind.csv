920809,0,t3_24mfge,So bit of a strange question what is it that makes a post recognizable as a HeavyMind post? What is it about this photograph that irks whatever part of our subconscious that makes it so powerful?Dont misunderstand Im not insulting Im just honestly curious as to what part of our subconscious were addressing and why is it there?Example there was a picture of a military mom coming home on rpics a few days ago that made me tear up. It made me emotionally involved in their reunion I imagined being both those people and how powerful it would have been for them to finally see each other and the indescribable happiness they must have felt.But this picture is just as powerful and moving yet I cant articulate why or how. Its certainly darker but Itd be simplistic to say that was the only reason its powerful.

2453951,0,t1_cmezm51,gtIndian land tenure systems were varied. While some ownership was completely or almost completely communal other ownership was more like todays fee simple. The degree of private ownership reflected the scarcity of land and the difficulty or ease of defining and enforcing rights.gtBecause agricultural land required investments and because boundaries could be easily marked crop land was often privately owned usually by families or clans rather than individuals. For example families among the Mahican Indians in the Northeast possessed hereditary rights to use welldefined tracts of garden land along the rivers. Europeans recognized this ownership and deeds of white settlers indicate that they usually approached lineage leaders to purchase this land. Prior to European contact other Indian tribes recognized Mahican ownership of these lands by not trespassing.,Heavymind,cmf0et1,1,t5_2srjv

Relationships Ive been in have come about because Ive got everything else so why not a gf?. Ive just been whatever about the process. Once i got myself single and started thinking long and hard about the things Ive done. Reflection. Airing out those locked rooms. Cleaning houseJust remembering things painful things and taking a lesson away from that particular experience makes it not a waste being subjected to it in the first place. Now you realise things learned from good times AND the bad times have built you into who you are at this moment.Now you just need to implement what youve learned to change your future if you wantAnd that also means having that list of what you will accept and what you wont from a partner and hold yourself in the same regardSorry for the long winded thingy Im kind of thinking aloud. Ive gone though how Id redo past relationships in my head but instead of subjecting myself to the frustration that is i cant do shit to change the past i can still change the future  by implementing lessons learned to make the next one fucking awesomeTldr learn from yours and others mistakes but everyone has their own journey.

Ya I would imagine that would annoting after a while makes me think of something i can acutally say ive experienced which are occasional moments where like some memory from high school or something comes flashing back and theres a sudden visceral physical feeling of regret of the judgement of others in that past situation.

How bad does Winter get really for you. . . the Abyss is welcoming and kind to those who wander towards its gentle embrace. Youre only projecting your own thoughts unto it and so youre dutifully shown the augmentation the dissolution the conflict the resolve.Gentle sleep will come to those exhausted from their meditations I do hope that you do not think that slavery to the self is anything more than the earnest expression of the raw mettle of humanity. Anger demons sin vice but also selfless empathy and love. Slumber deep within the black milk and drink until you are quenched.Oh and the dont blink thing is soooo RDJ Doctor Who I mean really.EDIT oops didnt mean to gang up on you with the blinking comment haha,Heavymind,cqubfdh,1,t5_2srjv

4780152,0,t3_3gbucd,I seriously like this piece. The white space around the subject implied to me that the immolation was the only thing able to be processed by the one burning. With that too the simple versus detailed definition given to the hand also visualizes the mind of the one who is burning  the primal recesses of the psyche focusing on the appendage in mortal peril. I also enjoy that the coloring is blue as when pain and specifically heat becomes so sharp as to feel cold.I lurk in this sub and occasionally somebody posts something truly heavy albeit usually hamfisted and cliche. This piece is fantastic in a poetic sense. The imagery is simple but the emotion and experience conveyed is done in an elegant and subtle way. Thanks for sharing. ,Heavymind,ctx2ulw,3,t5_2srjv
