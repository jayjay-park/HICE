His extremely descriptive writing style is just amazing.Murakami is a like a Japanese Stephen King in that he writes beautiful long novels with weird mystical shit going on which isnt explained and doesnt need one.,indianwriters,cgafugv,3,t5_2wlqh

2536936,0,t3_2oqfqx,Flow man. Flow. You have it at times and not at times. The opening nebulous boygirl was not well done IMO. Your description of the old mans plight was superb. You need to apply that level of finesse to your other characters. Overall the story was quite predictable and in such cases requires a little more meat in it. As in a few more details about the characters or the place  or their back stories. I would ideally recommend this as a template for a longer short story but Id suggest that you come up with a another plot. ,indianwriters,cmppp7k,1,t5_2wlqh
