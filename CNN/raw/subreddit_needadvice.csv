41740,0,t3_1ukusq,Im pretty dissapointed that your professor has been so unhelpful and probably helped push you from your dream career field. That being said bosses and professors are all different. Im not saying that in a real job you will not be stressed but it will be different than the college setting you are currently in. In the real world you can actually focus on your story or article and not have to worry about all those other classes that you need to graduate. Im of the opinion that you should finish out your degree. Others may disagree but that piece of paper will be helpful in the long run even if you decide to do something different later in life. You can look at it from an employers point of view. Does this person have a good work ethic? What are their skills? Additionally isnt it worth it to stick it out just a bit more due to all the time effort and money youve put in? I personally think it would be a waste of money if you quit. If you do decide to go the nanny route you may be able to get a sidejob doing articles or blogging down the line if you want. Still the degree would not hurt here either. Id be sure that you actually have a job though before you drop out of school to chase this new dream career.   Interviews can also be stressful but that isnt a reason to quit what you are doing. You have to interview for most jobs out there. Im relatively shy myself but I recommend rehearsing your interviews prior to and going over potential questions that they might ask. Interviewing is a skill and a very handy skill to have in your toolbag or on your Batbelt. Ive rambled on a bit much but I do wish you the best. If you have any questions Ill be here all week!    ,needadvice,cej6lmo,1,t5_2r367

I think you crossed a major line amp deserve some sort of consequence for your actions.Heres my thoughts. Its going to spread through your school that it was from you it was knowingly unwanted amp you did it anyway. At some point the admin will likely have to do something because as I mentioned you cant just post overtly sexual  explicit things about other people without consequence. Also most anonymous post can still be traced. Your best bet in my mind would be to go to your principals office and turn yourself in. Say youre a frustrated kid amp it was a stupid mistake. You know you shouldnt post unwanted sexual things amp youd like to make things right. Accept whatever consequence they give you learn a lesson and move on with life. If you choose to ignore this the consequences will become more severe. If you choose to deny it you run a risk where law enforcement could actually get involved. Just step up amp deal with it.

Basically in any large population there will be people who want to practice their English socialize with expats and drink. Language exchanges usually happen in bars or cafs and are usually very friendly events. It is a fast way to meet locals who are actively interested in befriending foreigners and a good way to practice your Japanese in a low stakes low stress situation.  Youll have to do a bit of research but the way I found them in Spain was to contact English language academies to see if they knew of any.

165892,0,t1_cex5mvq,My vet actually says that exactly. I have a miniature schnauzer and two Great PyreneesLab mix pups and I would say that I have very extensive experience in dog training as I have been the one to train these three and my best friend who also firmly believes in crates is a professional dog trainer. All three of them have extensive crate training and I can assure you  that they are exceptionally well behaved dogs. All three of them. And believe me they spent hours at least  up to  on end in their crates as theyre maturing up to  months after that they have more freedom. And with this I have  accidents nothing gets chewed there are  aggression or anxiety issues amazing for the schnauzer they can be..picky and no territorialalpha problems or excessiveunnecessary barking. They are all very laid back happy dogs. My vet believes in crating as long as you portray it as their den their space. It gives them a sense of where they belong in the order of the house. Dogs are den dwellers instinctively and as long as you do it correctly crate training is a dog owners best friend. Hands down. I could also cite that many of my dog owning friends have practiced this with great success but I cant go beyond that. ,needadvice,cexbti1,2,t5_2r367

During college I was pretty insecure from constantly comparing myself to students that had straight As.  But in the end I graduated with an awesome job offer and seven years later have more than doubled the salary at my first company.A couple of suggestionsIf there are a couple classes dragging your GPA down retake them.Do attend the career fairs its good practice at shaking hands breaking the ice test driving different resumes and practicing interview questions.  Learn how to make social connections in a short amount of time and make yourself memorable.Join a club like IEEE.  At the school I attended IEEE hosted different companies at career fairs. It was a great way to get more  on  face time with recruiters and often times we would give the recruiters a bound copy of IEEE members resumes.  These would typically go to the top of their lists.  This was ultimately how I landed my first job.Consider applying for a work coop instead of an internship. I had a couple friends who had grades that were slipping because they were getting burnt out.  The coops have them a taste of what the real engineering world was like and it renewed them a bit.  Most of my friends that had coops ended up getting hired by those companies.On a more personal note your lack of energymotivationenthusiasm might mean you have something medical going on.

Tell them that it would ruin your self respect and your sense of identity. Research and go in detail about why drugs are bad for people. Write a paper about it and tell them that you are a changed person and you need to spend more time with family than at a camp. Protest till your last breath. Even better tell them that you read about Steve jobs and his history of drugs amp that motivated you to do it as you want to be really successful one day as well.

699754,0,t3_22644c,hey therei was in the exact. same. situation as you so heres my advice good things and badim not sure how your family situation was but my parents and i i was very lucky had an understanding that they would assist my with tuition when it was time for me to go to college. i was accepted to two great universities and i was very excited to move on to the next step with my friends. however the divorce happened and it changed everything. i no longer had the financial support i was expecting. so rather than deciding to go the student loan route i decided to get a fulltime job and stay around home while going to community college for two years then transfer. frankly thats a decision that i truly dont regret at all i would do that again in a heartbeat. i had decent enough grades to transfer right into one of those other year universities with no problem.one thing that worked out great too is that my grades from my first two years at the community college didnt count toward my GPA at the four year university. I worked my fucking ass off and got great grades my junior and senior year and ended up graduating cum laude. and because of this i got in to an INCREDIBLE graduate program that im currently in right now.however some negatives. once again im not sure how your family is...but mine was a super tight unit. the divorce destroyed my family and to this day none of us four are entirely close...but that was a decision we all kinda collectively made. none of us really looked for one another for help and looked elsewhere instead a regret that i have to this day. as the youngest of the family it hit me really really hard...i had a vision in my head as to what the rest of my life would be like...and it was really shattered. i felt i was entitled to it. i felt i was entitled to a lot that didnt happen...and i handled it poorly. i got into a shit load of trouble legal personal etc lost a lot of friendships ruined a lot of opportunities such as getting a peace corps invite revoted due to legal troubles. the point is outside of work and school i was beyond reckless with everything else. i partied super hard to try to make myself feel better about everything else that was going on. by drinking laughing getting attention from at the time i thought they were friends...it felt good...it made a lot of other things that made me feel awful go away. i opted for shallow happiness to cover a deep sadness. so if i have any advice to you on that front just...it sucks to do...but just deal with the sadness that you may or may not feel as in the long run its sooo much better to deal with as it happens. i wish i could go back and tell my  year old self that things will work out things will be okay and to not worry so much and to not mourn what you THOUGHT you were ENTITLED to.you make your own path man. it sounds like you have a great head on your shoulders. just have faith in you your smarts your work ethic...and things will be fine.anyway congrats on the graduation man! things will be great!edit grammar,needadvice,cgjtbwl,3,t5_2r367

She might be able to provide a reasonably happy home life for you.  If you find her absolutely detestable to be around and I mean just unbearable there are boys and girls homes around the country that you might be able to stay at instead.  Most are fairly religious.  But they do provide a stable environment to finish growing to adulthood in.In the meantime are you ok?  Your town or county may have youth counseling services.  Your school should be able to tell you how to get in touch with them.  In our area they are free.  I dont know about your area but your school should be able to tell you.  And talk to your school counselor.  You really need someone that is local to you that can help you.  If they wont help you directly I am sure they can direct you to help.I am guessing that your mom worked as long as she could?  She will have social security benefit credits and once she passes youll be able to collect a survivors benefit that is for the children of deceased workers.,needadvice,chfrxv7,3,t5_2r367

Lynda.com explains it well in this course Essentially someone can photograph into a home if there is no expectation of privacy. If your blinds and curtains arent drawn in your house there is technically no expectation of privacy. You are yourself public scenery. This is why you can be branded a sex offender if you are seen putzing around naked by your windows. People can photograph other people in a public setting but it is illegal to snap a photo of someone in a bathroom stall for example because there is an expectation of privacy. As long as he was standing on a sidewalk or road he was on public property and it was within legality to shoot photos. If he literally went up to your window to snap the photos that might be a different matter as he may have been standing on private property. It literally all comes down to where he was standing when he took the photos.,needadvice,chgjsbo,2,t5_2r367

The very confused medical supply place sold a year supply of these stickers in hrs and for a few months pictures of the stickers applied to various objects kept popping up.  Those stickers had a use.On the other hand if your stickers say something stupid like Item   then they might have other uses like you could stick them together and build something out of them or something like that.,needadvice,chi6qeo,12,t5_2r367

1363141,0,t3_29o5b0,Collection agents will sometimes most of the time use aggressive and downright dishonest tactics. Call them. Tell them that youre going to go see a lawyer and you need some information.  Ask them the following Who is suing you? The contact details of their lawyer? How much is the debt? Why were no notices sent and when was the last notice they have on record?If they ask you any questions just say Well Im being sued so I probably shouldnt say anything until I talk to my lawyer.  If they admit that the letter was just to get your attention tell them that its unfortunate they decided to begin that way but that if they agree to treat you with civility youll talk to them.At this point start negotiating. If the debt is reasonable theyll usually go for  and interest forgiven if you pay in a lump sum. If they dont agree to that offer a payment plan. If they agree to that tell them that you need to draw up a budget so you can see what you can afford to pay every month. Show them a budget that shows you just barely scraping by theyll worry that youll start missing payments and be more open to offering you a discount on a lump sum payment. Good luck.Edit Just so you understand how it works they are not collecting the debt for whoever you originally owed money to. They bought the debt and now you owe the money to them. They bought the debt for somewhere between  of its original value and how they make their money is by collecting more than that. So they definitely can negotiate and if they think you wont pay unless they discount the debt they will. ,needadvice,cin5qnj,2,t5_2r367

If you think youre going to be MANLY because youve lost your virginity or that this compares to your friends who have developed a relationship in order to have sex or have refined their social skills to the point that they get one night stands then youre in for a rude awakening.

Im not attaching judgment to that cause personally I am all for prostitution but this isnt going to achieve what you want.And let me tell you if you plan on hiring a prostitute for the next  years your chances of all sorts of problems will escalate and likely lead you to never developing the skills necessary to obtain sex on your own  this isnt a scare tactic you know the risks of STDs getting caught by police etc but are you aware of the codependency problems depression performance anxiety etc that will likely accompany all of this if you opt for a prostituterelationship for  years?

1758154,0,t1_ck0rkln,part ? im losing track its late. haha. Reshuffling the deck.The police never arrested Ted Binion for the shooting that night a rotund short pit boss named walter rosanski from a nice polish immigrant family came forward  wearing teds signature sports jacket  and claimed responsibility for the shooting.  If the police ever asked for a motive Ill never know its not like that mattered did it? Heh.  Motive?  Means  Opportunity  heh.   So lets get coherent with what we can here. The facts of the situation are this  Within  weeks of the murder all of the witnessess changed their description from a tall slim man in a tan sports blazer with thinning light colored hair to essentially fitting the description of rosanski.  Not all of them had seen rosanski so often this was Uhh yeah man. i mean i dunno it was dark.  he coulda been short he coulda been tall. i said he was tall but You know what I was sittin down so yeah he was short. And the light hair well that was cuz he was under the lights.  under the lights? Yeah!  so you could see clearly? oh no no the lights was too bright. I had my hand over my eyes starin down at him.  wait you were sitting? what? yeah i was sitting.  so i had my hand over my eyes starin at him. office shakes his head.  It became clear and the FBI told us that the payoffs were made ALL the witnesses would finger rosanski. The gun had never been found and the sports coat covered in rances blood was found in the possession of the pit boss. the fact that they found ted crying in the casino cage was of no consequence his lawyer said he was traumatized. So speaking of lawyers.Walter Rosanski a pit boss who had worked for a short time here in las vegas all on the up and up aquired Oscar Goodman mob mouthpiece and eventual las vegas mayor as his lawyer.  To this day Goodman denies knowledge of anything that points to anyone other than rosanski.  Goodman was good friends with Ted of course and would know if ted ever really would do suck a thing! it was absurd.  The Judge in the case was not linked to the Binions but through his generous friend Judge Hairy Claiborne of particular notoriety in nevada as being the only judge to refuse to give up his seat until he was sent to jail on tax evasion charges Seethe way the FBI explained it when you take bribes  in the  figure range if you cant clean it it eventually will out you. and you go down for tax evasion much cleaner than BRIBERY isnt it? anyhow the judge in rosanskis case  the only case that would ever be brought forward in the shooting death of Rance Blevins  told the prosecution its case was weak and to make a deal and hurry he had an appointment.  well the prosecution came to our family and told us heres thet hing well never get ted.  if we go to trial well never get this guy theyll just buy the jury.  what we have is that this guy has already accepted responsibility. he said he shot him.  He never said why though or that it wasnt an accident.  we could ask that at trial but risk losing to a bought jury.  well take him for manslaughter  manslaughter  because that is the highest charge we are certain we can get them to agree to. ok?  well you arent really being offered choices.  so tis OK at this point.  Rosanski entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter  and sauntered off into his sentence of  months.... probation. He left Las Vegas and our story here.advance story to about a year later suddenly without any notice my aunt and cousins moved from las vegas.  Debbie was a mother and had  baby children to think about you cant blame her.  I suspect the story went something like this You can sue binions for wrongful death and you can be a wrongful death too look at your husbands coffin and imagine your babies in front of two of em.  dont sue dont be stupid let this die heres  grand get outa town never come back. and Again this is a work of fiction and I love my relatives so lets leave it there.its interesting the confluence of murder murderers conspiracy and the attempt to overthrow or overturn judges in this story.

If it is going to be upsetting to them or viewed as insensitive then I would respect their wishes and refilmnot release it.I personally think it would be nice if with the consent of her parents you could release the video as a tribute to her. Perhaps put a short bit of text at the beginning or end of the video that is in her memory.

A few dos and donts from my own experience DONT encourage overzealous drinking i.e. shots drinking contests silly drinking games.DO have nonalcoholic beverages and food on hand. Encourage people to eat and drink water inbetween alcoholic beverages.DONT have an open door policy. You set the guest list and thats final. Many people dont give a shit about your stuff read your parents stuff and will break or steal it without caring. DO plan some kind of activity  party games can seem lame but after a drink or two can get quite lively. hopefully this can help keep the drinking pace down too. DONT let people drive. Want to party like adults act like responsible adults and get a taxi. YOU can be held liable for what happens to them. dont piss your life away just before if gets good.The real kickers DONT drink yourself. You get to set the tone for what goes and what doesnt. If youre passed out in your own puke its no holds barred for everyone else. Prepare for a potentially shitty night cause hanging around with a bunch of drunk teenagers sucks.

1988371,0,t3_2hh10l,Bear in mind a few things Interviewing well is a skill. Like any other skill you are likely to fail a few times before you get the knack. So in a way treat this as practice. You will be nervous. You never had an interview before. Your interviewer will expect you to be nervous. They have seen your CV so know you arent the most experienced when it comes to the world of work. Also you are . My advice is to think of some examples of things that match questions you are likely to be asked. Although the specifics vary remember that they are always asking you the same questionWhy should we give you this job?The answer is always  I can meet this skill set because I did X thing at X time OR I am prepared to meet this skill set because I learnt X thing at X time. At the end of the interview ask lots of questions. Will there be training? Will there be a chance of promotion? What is my chance of extending my contracttenure? What does an average day look like if I were to get the job? Something that really helps me in interviews to echo another comment here is that you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you. You dont want a crappy job with a bunch of arseholes. So politely ask them the questions that you need the answers to. ,needadvice,cksssej,1,t5_2r367

I suggest the words of Buddha. If that doesnt speak to you there are many other paths.  Try reading The Celestine Prophecy its a great story that can help you find the     beauty in life.

2127286,0,t3_2jbu0h,I think it would be appropriate to ask about the status of your application. Ideally what you would have done would have been to ask for a timeframe from the recruiter after which point you could get in touch with them or they would contact you but if its been a full week you can drop them an email asking about the status of your application. If you google online youll find a lot of sample letters for this sort of thing and find one that suits your industry and needs. Keep it very professional and brief make sure that you dont come off as desperate or needy and acknowledge that you know the recruiter is extremely busy. Thank them again for all the time theyve put into your application and express what a pleasure it was to come in and meet them. Assure them that youre still very interested in and excited about the possibility of working with their company.However also be prepared that the answer youll likely get is either that theyre still reviewing applications or that the position has been filled though at your stage in the interview process its typically polite for a recruiter to inform you of this. If theyd decided on you theyd have informed you so unless your email happens to coincide perfectly with their decision assume theres a reason they havent been in touch. However I would still email them to check in keep you in their minds and let them know youre still keen. ,needadvice,cla83f1,3,t5_2r367

Not doing this is like trying to fix a broken hammer using itself  they arent thinking clearly and they need help from outside their own brain. Encourage them to learn about Depression. Compare this to a Schizophrenic  they need to learn how to differentiate whats actually happening instead of their brains warped interpretation. Be there to sympathize and listen. Having friends to talk to is enormously helpful. You know how when you stub your toe it feels better to yell and curse? Letting them vent to you is doing just that.

Stay deadpan and say Just dont do it again and were cool okay?  Then if he does it again either refuse to get close to him give him a handshake instead of a hug or if he forces the issue make a scene.  Push him away take a step back and say FIRMLY I TOLD YOU I DO NOT WANT YOU TO TOUCH ME LIKE THAT IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE.  The point is to make it embarrassing for him.Again no more hugs.  Give him a handshake or nothing.  And if he keeps forcing the issue or grabs you without consent after youve made it VERY clear multiple times in a way that CANNOT be interpreted as playful then defend yourself.

2651364,0,t1_cn4llv1,When I was homeless. I slept in a garage for a few months. I knew this guy who had what amounts to basically a shack with a garage on the side. I asked if I could sleep in his garage and he said yes as long as I dont move the broken down pick up truck that was already parked there. So I took a mattress and put it in the back of the pickup truck and slept there. I used his hose to shower in his back yard. The house was infested with fleas and it was tough but it made me the man I am today. I never once felt sorry for myself. I Knew it was a temporary situation. Good luck. ,needadvice,cn4nx3b,2,t5_2r367
2678557,0,t1_cn86cww,Thanks for your advice let me try to explain my situation in more detail. A city worker came over to assess the situation and basically said there was probably a leak in a pipe under my house. There were  shutoff valves that he looked at one was in the basement where my furnace is and the other was outside in a hole in my driveway thats normally covered up and was really deep. He turned the one off outside in my driveway.Without explaining much he gave me  options he could leave the water on and the leak could get more severe cause flooding in my basement etc. but Id have water. Or he could turn it off and then Id find a plumber or someone to fix the problem before it got worse. He explained that it was a problem Id have to deal with as a new homeowner.Now Im just waiting for some plumbers to arrive and give me more information on the situation but Im panicking because my garage is sinking a bit now as well.,needadvice,cn87i9j,2,t5_2r367

How do you know they think you are lying?  Maybe theyre not and the problem is in your mind.Find an online place of people who have had similar accomplishments and share with them so you feel less need for ?validation? from those in your offline world.

Become a Big BrotherBig Sister volunteer at a nursing home and adopt a few grandparents older people often lose competitiveness so have no reason to bring you down by reducing your accomplishments.  Join SCORE Service Core of Retired Executives and mentor young business people who want a mentor with accomplishments and will appreciate your past.  Finally ask yourself if you are hanging with the right crowd maybe you need to reconsider your choice of friendsacquaintances and make some newdifferent ones.  Consider the possibility that the people you hang with are skeptical because they have little to no accomplishments of their own so believing you have more makes them feel bad about themselves.  Find people who are comfortable with themselves and have no ego hangups.  Or ones who have actually accomplished things similar to you so they believe it can be done and therefore believe you could do it.  Just my thoughts.

I like where we live. The neighborhood and schools are great. Shopping is convenient cant beat a Wegmans just across the road from the development. The house we bought had been updated in the previous  years windows siding bathrooms and kitchen so we didnt have to do much when we moved in which was nice as we were about to have our first child. The downside is that we stayed with the previous owners tastes longer than we should have eventually gutted kitchen to make it more functional. I think I would get a house that needs work next time at least  years from now so we could make it the way we want it from the get go.The one thing I didnt appreciate was the cost and time of commuting to NYC from NJ. Tolls and high NJ Transit fares from where we are add up. Spending over an hour each way on the commute wears on you though living in NYC I was used to a  min subway ride with transfers just to go  miles. Fortunately I now work from home quite often my wife has an office  min from the house.

4263733,0,t3_39sulf,Ok.. Here we go.. You want two of everything. A back up ID and other important identification one of these should be really small and never leave your person. You want to have two places for money my favorite method is to wear a pair of basketball shorts under your normal clothes or atleast something with a pocket. Keep a  wrapped around some smaller bills in your right front pocket or in a crappy wallet in your back pocket. This is where you pull your money from in public if you need to get to your main money supply go to a bathroom or somewhere private. Do not ever let on that you have more money than you do and if you get robbed do not hesitate to just hand them over the shit wallet. Pretty much dont keep anything important in this wallet and if you want write some notes and shit smarting off to the robber that always gave me a chuckle.  Thats my quick off the cuff response just keep your money safe and dont be a fucking idiot. For more i would need more information from ya. Are you a manwoman?

Youre the life of the party. Third drink you begin to talk bullshit pick fights. Not fun. Your senses lack coordination. Fourth drink  the room begins to spin with you. You cant walk a straight line cant find the door out. Your thoughts slow down. Really horrible feeling. Drink beyond that you fall down pass out. Everything goes dark. Youll probably want to vomit thats a good thing. Again Im pretty big guy.  Kg. So I could drink a lot. When I say one drink its like a glass of vodka no ice not the regular shot glass. I would like to advise you to limit yourself to three drinks max per evening. Dont fall into peer pressure. Its much more fun letting your mates getting drunk making fools of themselves and then banging their dates. Girls dont really like to hang out with drunks. Dont switch drinks  if you start with beer stay with beer. If you start with bourbon stay with it. If you dont youll get drunk faster.Stay away from soju or sake  you get drunk and pass out before knowing what happened.Drink a glass of water between drinks. Eat before going out drinking.

4937918,0,t3_3iiesj,Boric acidborax powder.Its an inexpensive powder pretty much nontoxic to humans and very effective against all types of insects. Its actually found in a lot of pesticides you can even find it marketed as a pesticide at Home DepotLowes. I live in FL where all types of bugs end up in your house especially if you move into an apartment or somewhere that has been vacant. The powder is the only stuff that has worked besides exterminators.I dont know how it actually kills them some say it irritates their exoskeleton some says it clogs up their insides and dries them out but it works. All you really have to do is sprinkle a fine layer of the stuff where you know they crawl small cracks along baseboards under the sink blow some of it into electric sockets. They walk over it when they come out looking for food. They then lick it off themselves and then take it back to their nest where others lick it off because they like to stay clean. Next thing you know dead roaches are popping up all over the place.If you want to make sure they ingest the stuff then you can make a bait ball by mixing it with cocoa powder or sugar. The important thing to remember is to let them walk on the stuff and take it back to their buddies also you repeat the steps  weeks later and again in another  weeks to make sure you get the babies too. When thats all said and done you need to go around the house and calk up even the smallest of cracks along your baseboards outlets under the sink etc. Roaches loves those areas and its how they get in and out of living area. Even if you cant get them out of the walls theyll die off or leave without an abundant access to food.Also make your landlord treat the apartment before you do anything. Not sure what state you live in but they have to make provide an habitable environment.

I come once a week.Itd be good if she chose to go to water aerobics class but I cant do it with her..basically the best thing I can do for her is initiate the process in her but I dont know how to do that.gtPeople tend to eat what is there and easily available so I would make sure there were healthy choices ready to eatYeah..not her your son was ready for change it seems to me..she isnt. everything in that household is healthy my moms a dietician my dad runs ultramarthrons and eats all kinda healthy..things...like wheat grass and spirulina .I cook only vegan food and bring things over at the weekend my other sister is vegetarian and is a dancer.gtI do worry that if you pressure her about it that she will take to eating as a source of self comforting.Yep which is why I dont pressure her its obviously not the right way..She gets all her candies by going to stores I remember her stealing candies from the stores on multiple occasions when she was younger..young as much as  year old shes stolen money on several occasions from me my other sister and my parents to fuel her addiction to sugar. this is some next level shit..I mean I guess normal people cant fathom..you know what it means to need candies this much because shes not a psychopath.,needadvice,cv8kgye,3,t5_2r367

But heres how I see it They have little relevance to my daily life.I see the stories read what happened and form my opinions sure. But it only ever comes up in idle conversation with people who are just as safe in their lives as I am.I wake up shit shower and shave got to work come home drink a beer eat dinner and occupy myself until I go to bed and repeat the process. Fact is I could die at any moment. We all could. I could crash my car choke on dinner accidentally inhale and drown on my gear cut an artery while shaving slip in the shower prolapse while pooping etc. But it is HIGHLY unlikely for someone to come and shoot up the location I happen to be at at any given time.They arent relevant to my life really.

Junk food is now dead to you. I had to imagine cheesy popcorn was mold balls to stop eating it. Movies arent the same. Now we find replacements. What flavors do you specifically like? Look for foods that have similar flavors. There was a chart I saw awhile back linking junk food cravings to actual dietary needs. Potato chips is lack of good fats or salt. Try all sorts of healthy snack options. Air popped popcorn with seasoning. Frozen blueberries with a splash of milk. Carrots small fruits bell peppers seeds and nuts try it all! Find your treasure food. We dont eat junk anymore. Portion it to fit your macros and dont eat more than one serving at a time. Drink lots of water. Find your forever nutritional plan. Work in the occasional treat. Dont drown yourself in triple fudge but my grandmother always left room for a square of chocolate at the end of the day. She had a light day to allow for a hearty soup later in the week. Maintaining weight is a balancing act so prepare yourself well. ,needadvice,d1ubr44,1,t5_2r367

Remind him that you value his friendship but you also value and need your house to be your own personal space and when he comes over without asking he violates your space and disrespects you.So from the point of that conversation on if he comes over without asking he will not be allowed in and will be asked to leave.  If he wants to come over he must call and request permission first and you will tell him yes or no and he will respect your answer.

Just try and let them know that youre there for them without being too direct with the fact that theyre self harming. Its honestly really hard to stop cutting and having  friend tell you to stop wont do anything.

But I remember sage advice from my father you never really have to grow up until you have to. What he means is... Just because youre now recognized as an adult why do you have to grow up? Im still a kid. I sing Disney songs I play games I eat junk food.... Im hardly ever an adult. For things like job interviews or when I take a kid to court I work with teens in the system then I put my big boy pants on and act my age. But really Im a big kid! The cool thing is I have money to spend and no stupid adults to ask permission or tell me what to do.My point is... Dont sweat it. You have plenty time to be a kid. Childhood doesnt have to end. Also reading more into your post you could have a similar depression to mine. I have zero motivation or energy to do anything. And Im in my prime!!When I feel Im in a depressive state I force myself to do something. Anything. Shower dress nice visit a friend cook dinner... Something. It helps a lot for me. You could give it a shot. If it doesnt work seek a therapist. I visited mine once and my life was changed. You arent me so I wont say one session and BAM! It could be more. But it can help.Heres a bit more. Youre homeschooled so I assume you dont get much social interaction with your peers. Find a hobby. Attend events. Mine is Magic The Gathering. My friends and I meet up weekly for magic games and I frequently head to my local game store for games and tournaments. Or try a sport. They say a body at rest tends to stay at rest. Which is  true. Working with my kiddos Ive learned that theyre WAY less depressed angry anxious what have you after theyve had fresh air and excersize. It really improves their moods. I suggest getting out and active. Try jogging to start.Really... Anything man. The world really is your oyster. You say you feel like youre missing out so... Why not go try something? Anything?

8752935,0,t3_4zxx2y,Youre not abnormal for spending your time watching Netflix and on reddit. I know so many people who would count those two things as their main hobbies! Actually I am the do too. People arent really going out every weekend and climbing mountains maybe some people are but the majority are not. I do think finding a hobby that you enjoy but also gives you a sense of satisfaction or achievement can do wonders for your selfesteem. Anything where you can make or create something or youre working towards goals will give you a sense of achievement.  This documentary taught me a lot about this. How happiness really depends on you contributing to the world and having a hobby etc. So I definitely suggest it.I used to have fairly low self esteem myself. A few years ago I was struggling with my body image and I had a huge realisation as I was walking through my campus. Two girls were walking towards me and they were laughing the first thing I thought was theyre laughing at me because Im fat. The next thing I thought or realised was that whatever theyre saying about me tells you a lot more about what sort of people they are than it does about me. This was like an epiphany. Whatever other people are saying about you  especially if its about petty stuff  doesnt actually have anything to do with you and it has everything to do with how that person perceives the world. Now I dont know if everyone around you is actually twofaced or maybe theyre reflecting your attitude back towards you. Im not saying you are a bad person and of course I dont know you but if you gossip or bitch about other people or are quite judgmental then people will start to think youre not a very nice person and someone who cant be trusted. Also people sometimes will reflect your attitude or behaviour when youre with them so if youre being twofaced that might have something to do with it.Im just saying this because all the stories on reddit about relatives or coworkers who are always awful to everyone around them. I believe these people must be thinking the world is against them and not necessarily realising that they are the problem. So I hope you are not the problem but its always good to reflect on the way you have been treating and interacting with people to ensure you dont end up becoming not a very nice personAnyway if you have been completely nice and kind and honest with people than the problem is not you and its the people youre spending time with. Ive found when I used to hang out in friendship groups there are always problems. The thing is people get jealous of a good friend spending more time with someone else in the group and that causes tension. Or people gossip about others and tell other people your secrets. When you decide to just spend time with  or  friends at once and only hang out with close friends or people you want to keep in contact with then you find your true friends. You might only have a couple of friends who are true friends but its not about quantity its about quality. If its family thats the problem thats more difficult  you cant necessarily cut family members from your life. Im not good with confronting my family about anything so Im the wrong person to ask about that. Anyway sorry for the essay. I hope that helps you somewhat. I wish you the best and I hope you find happiness and good friends. ,needadvice,d6zrvpk,1,t5_2r367

Dont force yourself to be funny all the time and they wont think youre depressed when youre not.

I hate people who do this constantly as you can never be sure if theyre trolling or not. So yeah i would suggest you dont pretend to be serious when youre not cause if youre like me and like goofing one day and be serious the next one then people will assume everything you say is a joke even when its not funny.

Ive had several  hour conversations with my roommates which I would consider far more enjoyable than any party.Also I dropped out of school because I was failing everything several times over. I though I could never be a productive person but it turns out I can be very productive and that school specifically is something I dislike knew it all along just denied it when I began college.I have to reiterate this is a very common process for someone reaching adulthood  as the machine that guided you through your education fades away you lose your sense of impending achievement and are dumped into a freely moving system with no innate direction.

Heres my basic thought process. What kind of consequences am I worried about happening? Is it their reaction? Is it what theyll think of me?. Will their reaction actually have negative consequences for me beyond a little joking or a little laughing or something? Is the interaction in general something thats actually important? Do I need to care about their opinion in this instance?. If there are negative consequences are they really that serious? If so can I avoid the situation or mitigate it? . If there are not actual serious consequences just...do whatever. Yes I will feel awkward. Yes I might feel embarrassed if something I do didnt go over well. Yes I will probably be embarrassed anyway. But people dont actually care that much unless you do something really really bad. And I will feel much more free if I just live my life. If you do have to make a good impression or whatever put on a reasonable amount of effort. As I said Im incredibly selfconscious socially and about my appearance. Its always a work in progress. Logically I know that people who know me more or less know what I look like. It doesnt mean Im ready to wear a swimsuit in front of them.

If youre not paying money or have legal ownership of the exact place his vehicle is then its tough luck. Of course there are some social faux pas happening here but nothing legally enforceable. Id try to look up some local city code. Some municipalities limit how long a certain length vessel can be parked in residential areas. If thats the case then hes violating city ordinances and not doing anything against you if that makes sense. Hope this helps. ,needadvice,dd10ts4,8,t5_2r367

10610945,0,t3_5rvea5,gtonly my dad and he scratches his groin area so compulsively that he has caused open sores.Forgive me for even asking this but do you think there is any chance at all that he might have acquired crabs somehow?  If you havent done so yet Id like to suggest that you get him to a doctor and you or your mom explain what is going on.  Myself Id be suspicious of crabs dust mites maybe fleas are there untreated pets in the house? and so on. But I would rule out medical reasons first.  He could even possibly have a skin condition that leads him to think that he is being bitten by something.gthe keeps a large bottle of isopropyl alcohol by his chair at all times and sprays himself This could cause dry skin and could easily be a source of his itching.  But there had to be something to cause him to start using it.  The root cause.Another reason I say to get him in to a doctor is that it may be early onset dementia.  I believe they have medicines to slow the progression of that and I had just seen about a clinical trial of a treatment the other day that halts the progression of it.The reason I think perhaps dementia is that I knew of an elderly couple I am still in touch with the husband where the wife developed dementia.  When it first started she kept insisting that there were little people inside of light bulbs and they didnt like when the lights were turned on.  As it progressed she would break down crying inconsolably saying she could hear them screaming and dying when the lights were on.  Then it got worse and other things would upset her as badly.  He finally had to put her into an assisted living facility he was afraid for her safety.So Id suggest that you get him in to the doctor explain what is going on and see what they say.,needadvice,ddafs30,1,t5_2r367

10775714,0,t3_5u0tfr,I have been interested in this myself and what I have found was consciously replacing these thoughts with thoughts that are uplifting and focusing on the positive have made me see things different. When I catch myself with a negative thought I replace it with a positive thought.   I have been practicing this for about a year and it has made me more content.  During these episodes I find myself in a hurry so I try to slow down and bring myself back to the present this is a form of meditation that uYOxMAMAxFOO has mentioned.

10781769,0,t3_5u72r7,Hi I wanted to reply because I was in a very similar situation to you last year. My mental health took a turn for the worst and so I did very badly in my second year of university. I had just about decided that dropping out and moving back to the safety of my parents house was my only option. Luckily I decided to visit the uni counseling service who helped MASSIVELY. They gave me extenuating circumstances for my exams so that lessened the stress a little. They also persuaded me to visit my GP and consider a more medical approach which I was reluctant to do at first..But am SO glad I did. Within a few months of counselling and medication I was feeling well enough to go back and start enjoying uni. But to be honest I started feeling slightly better after my first appointment with the counselling service  just knowing that someone knows what to do to help you is a massive relief. The whole reason for the counselling service being there is because people need it and these people are in no way pathetic. I felt that way when I was at my worst but now Im proud of myself for seeking the help I needed when I was feeling so hopeless. Id suggest that you stay enrolled on your course even if it means not submitting coursework etc. Forgive yourself for this youre just unwell  its not your fault just sucks. And also book an appointment with both your GP and your student counselling service today. Doing these is scary but so worth it trust me as someone whos not long left your shoes. Best of luck and feel free to PM me if you need to ,needadvice,dds27hn,5,t5_2r367

10899883,0,t1_de419tt,Trump himself called it a ban...gt Then they say that the last administration came up with the list and blame the current administration for implementing it.Thats what Trump and right wing media says...the truth is a single Republican came up with that list during the Obama administration attached it as a rider to a must pass spending bill and that was that.  It also said nothing of a travel ban.  Dont call it travel restrictions if every single person from those countries is restricted.  A ban is just restrictions at  right?  If you got banned from Reddit or from a sub to call that posting restrictions would be silly...gt Hey we just used drones to bomb the ever loving hell out of this remote village and murdered a bunch of families.... maybe we shouldnt let them come over here until they calm down a bitIran?  Also waiting for people to calm down before they come over?  This is absolutely garbage...many of the people affected have been waiting for this for many months already if not over a year.  They cant just buy a ticket and come over...theres a long waiting process built into the process.  So adding  months period for them to calm down a bit after theyve waited anywhere from almost a year to well over a year is absolutely terrible foreign policy logic.  I have a friend who just got married to a girl in Iran...it took them close to a year to get approved for her to come here.  Tons of paperwork thousands of dollars interview processes where they submitted photos of themselves...So those people should have to calm down a bit?  A lot of the people coming are also refugees...theyre coming here not because we bombed them but because of civil war that we had nothing to do with.  Learn your geopolitics dude.Also a ton of the people affected already lived here for years...they simply traveled abroad to visit family or to go to a funeral.  They work here have kids going to school here etc...yet a weekend trip should cause them to calm down a bit?  This is the silliest argument imaginable sorry.,needadvice,de48ul8,2,t5_2r367

Luckily someone else in your village was there for your son when you guys both needed help! First things first just like this isnt your sons fault it is not your fault either. You didnt do this you didnt set this up you didnt willingly put him in this position. Thats on the sick individual that did this. That guy needs serious help and his own personal issues dont have any bearing on your personal parenting skills.It also sound like this might be your only child or at least the oldest? Im sure youve had scares but at that age you probably havent had any real experience with people outside the family hurting him. Not a lot of school bullies at that age no broken hearts or kids teasing him. So one of the first times youre confronted with a stranger hurting your child in some way is this? Yeah thats terrifying. And we all want to believe wed be the hero in the situations like this but the reason why heroes are heroes is because theyre exceptional and break the norm. They go above the normal reactions. Being normal is just fine.I totally agree with the top post especially enrolling you both in selfdefense classes. This is a great opportunity for you two to bond for him to learn that he doesnt have to let fear suck his power away that he doesnt have to rollover and accept this. We all face things for the first time all the time. Making a mistake is just making a mistake and everyone makes them. How you handle the mistake and what you do to prevent it from happening again is what defines the kind of person you are. Good luck give that baby a big hug for me and please dont beat yourself up for being a human being with flaws. Just show your son that you dont need to let those flaws define you and youll be just fine. ,needadvice,df34l7c,6,t5_2r367

11301333,0,t3_61a0kl,It is hard to say that all these redditors are able to do everything nondepressed people do. If anything they may be the best at hiding their depression. Robin Williams for example.. his suicide was a shock to everyone. People can put on a good face for the world but still be in pain.I suffer with severe depression Im on medication and seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. Been on medication for a while slightly off and on the last  years but most consistently the last year. Been seeing the therapist weekly and the psychiatrist monthly for a year now. I struggle still. Im in bed  of the day only out of bed for classes. I still struggle with doing homework cleaning and for a while there I struggled with basic hygiene such as brushing my hair my solution for that was cutting it all off so I would stop having rats nests from not brushing it. Some days I struggle to go to class other days its a breeze. That being said I have come really far within the last year. I went from being a wreck to being semifunctioning and having more goodfair days than bad ones. The best thing you can do for yourself is see a doctor and a therapist. Try different medications to see which one works. If you are finding a certain medication doesnt work be totally honest about it with your doctor. Life style changes help a bit too. Set an alarm and force yourself to get at least  minutes of sunlight on your skin each day. Set an alarm and force yourself to walk for  minutes out doors each day. Set small goals. I will organize my desk today or I will do laundry today. Small things like this become a huge undertaking for depressed people and a lot of people dont understand that. Let your doctor know about your suicidal thoughts or preoccupation about wanting to die as well. Nothing gets cured overnight. For me it took a year of medication therapy and self discovery to even function on the level that I am at now. I feel like things could get worse but can always get better. Im better able to cope with some things better than I have before.,needadvice,dfczmml,5,t5_2r367

11467946,0,t1_dfvusj8,gtI just feel as all of the work Ive done the past two years has been without any fruition.It sounds like the work you have done has gained you the respect and faith of your employer. They want you working for them and believe that you can do this other task. It sounds like you were putting a lot of effort into your role. While laudable it will probably result in burn out in the long term. You may eventually come to hate the job and company especially if you were surpassed by other members of your team who took to the duties more naturally. gt I am not sure how to respondDo you think you will have more success with the new role? If so I would accept it. Dont stay with the old role because of work you have done in the past focus instead on how to succeed in the future. That applies to the original question about looking for another job as well. If you think you will go farther by rejecting the new role and changing companies then you should do what is best for you. ,needadvice,dfvvvxg,2,t5_2r367

11768791,0,t3_67xf02,Hi there I think you are half way there already since you have this self awareness. When you recognize that you have something you want to change you most likely will just remember that persistence is everything from this point forward. I would recommend to start with a schedule a written breakdown of how you would organize your game playing. I dont think completely stopping it will do the trick as im sure youll go through withdrawals. Gaming in moderation is healthy. You can also try to only play games after you have completed all that you needed to do especially homework.If you find that the schedule thing doesnt work I would recommend you to take some time and really think about why you are playing so much gaming? Besides fun and all what does it give you emotionally? My bf use to be quite addicted to gaming and through processing and thinking he realized he does it often is because that was his outlet for stress and allowed him to avoid reality and evade responsibilities and the like. Once he realized this he was better able to manage his game playing and only use it as a healthy means of managing stress. I believe you can too just take some time for yourself and think it through. At the same time stat integrating other activities into your life so you gaming isnt the only thing in your life that you thoroughly enjoy!,needadvice,dgu0ul3,2,t5_2r367
